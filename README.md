## Development requirements

### Python

During development I've used `python 3.12.7` and as everything should work okay with versions >=3.10 I can't guarantee that.

### OpenAI key

Valid OpenAI API key should be available as an environment variable. One can just put it in the `.env` file in the root of this repo. It will be pulled by the `conf.py` file and later can be used through this module.
