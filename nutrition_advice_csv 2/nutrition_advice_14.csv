Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was estimated through an adaptation of the score used by Panagiotakos in the ATTICA study19. A score of 0 was considered minimum adherence, compared to 80, which would be maximum adherence. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was grouped into three categories low (0–53 points), medium (54–59 points) and high (60–80 points).
