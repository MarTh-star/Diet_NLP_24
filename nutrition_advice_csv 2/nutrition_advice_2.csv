A total of 78 participants were randomized to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (n\u2009=\u200940) or the commercial weight loss program (n\u2009=\u200938). Two participants randomized to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet discontinued the study at the baseline visit prior to beginning the assigned dietary intervention on the following day, so no last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation was applied for these individuals. Participants included predominantly Caucasian (70.6%) women (n\u2009=\u200961) and men (n\u2009=\u200917) with overweight and obesity, with a mean baseline age of 50.4\u2009years, body weight of 95.7\u2009kg, and body mass index (BMI) of 34.4\u2009kg/m2.
