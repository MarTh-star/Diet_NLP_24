1,methods1," This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures involving human participants were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Centre Utrecht and the Medical Ethical Committee of TNO Nutrition and Food Research. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The design, cohort profile and rationale of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-NL are described elsewhere(  23  ). On average, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-NL cohort had a participation rate of 40 % (35 % in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Prospect and 45 % in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-MORGEN). The non-response was previously found to have an impact on prevalence estimates of, for example, smoking but not examined associations(  27  ).",f090bd9c-d836-4396-9e56-2f131d44f52f
2,methods2,"  Diet and environmental impact assessment Usual daily dietary intake was estimated by a 178-item FFQ, which has been validated against twelve 24-h recalls and biomarkers in 24-h urine and blood(  28  ,  29  ). Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients based on estimates of the FFQ and 24-h recalls in men were 0·51 for potatoes, 0·36 for vegetables, 0·68 for fruits, 0·39 for meat, 0·69 for dairy products, 0·76 for sugar and sweet products and 0·52 for biscuits and pastry. Results for women were similar. Energy intake and daily nutrient intakes were estimated using the 1996 Dutch Food Composition table(  30  ). Blonk Consultants assessed the environmental impact of food items consumed by the Dutch population(  31  ). Environmental impact was calculated based on life cycle assessments (life cycle assessments (LCA)). The life cycle assessments (LCA) were cradle to grave and included all steps from production, transport, preparation, to waste.",6e991c40-a617-447a-ac10-e2026ab836ea
3,methods3," The impact value of a food item is a weighted average of different subtypes of the product, for example, by country of origin, which is based on the Dutch production (for the Dutch market) and Dutch import data. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are expressed as kg CO2 equivalents/d. Land use is expressed as m2×year/d. These life cycle assessments (LCA) data were combined with the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-NL FFQ data to calculate daily greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use associated with the usual diet. For a more elaborate description of the calculation of the environmental impact of the diet, see our previous paper(  10  ).  Dietary indices Healthy Diet Indicator The Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) is based on the 2002 WHO guidelines(  12  ) and has previously been used in other European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-NL papers(  20  ,  21  ,  32  ,  33  ).",072ad90a-e388-4757-aa4d-f0ef29246147
4,methods4," The Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) score consists of six nutrients (SFA, PUFA, cholesterol, protein, dietary fibre and free sugars) and one food group (fruits and vegetables) (Table 1). When the intake was within the recommended range according to WHO’s guidelines, a score of 1 was assigned to that component; otherwise, 0 points were given. The final Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) score was the sum of all these components, ranging from 0 (minimal adherence) to 7 (maximal adherence).Table 1 Components and scoring criteria of the indices measuring adherence to dietary guidelines  	Maximum score	Minimum score	 Healthy Diet Indicator	1 point	0 points	  1.

Dietary Approaches To Stop Hypertension score The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score is based on eight criteria from the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) clinical trial from 1997(  14  ) and has been used in other analyses in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-NL(  20  ,  34  ). Included components are fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, Na, red and processed meats and sweetened beverages. For each of the components, participants were classified into sex-specific quintiles according to their intake. A score ranging from 1 to 5 was given to each quintile.",3952abd9-f430-40f0-a2e5-608765aeedb2
8,methods8," For all components except Na, red and processed meats and sweetened beverages, higher intakes were given higher scores, whereas for the latter components higher intakes were given lower scores (Table 1). In our population, only Na incorporated in food products is accounted for and added salt during cooking or at the table is not included. The overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score is the sum of all components and can range from 8 (lowest adherence) to 40 (highest adherence).  Dutch Healthy Diet index 2015 The DHD15-index is based on the Dutch dietary guidelines of 2015(  13  ) and is an updated version of the previous DHD-index presented by Van Lee et al. (  17  ). The DHD15-index consists of fifteen components (Table 1). A proportional score between 0 and 10 was assigned to the components. There are five component types included, which are adequacy, moderation, optimum, ratio and quality components.",abecb75d-3b3f-4c31-b0d5-0cf08bbab8ab
9,methods9," For adequacy components, the recommendation is to consume at least the mentioned quantity. The moderation components represent the foods for which the intake should be lowered. The optimum component has an optimal range of intake. The ratio components are based on replacement of one group by another food group. The quality component is based on the type of food group. The components vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, fish and tea are adequacy components, and the components red meat, processed meat, sweetened beverages and fruit juices, alcohol and Naare moderation components. The component dairy product is an optimum component with an optimal range of intake, whereas the fats and oils component is defined as a ratio component. The coffee component is defined as a qualitative component based on type of coffee (filtered or unfiltered).",0c19e744-2dc8-4930-ac06-199b2bcf27ad
10,methods10," The whole-grain component is scored with two subcomponents: an adequacy component for whole-grain consumption and a ratio component for the ratio whole-grain products and refined grain products.  More detailed information on the calculation of the DHD15-index will be published in another paper(  18  ). In short, for the adequacy components, a lower limit of intake was given. For example, for fruits, it is recommended to eat at least 200 g/d. This level of intake received the maximum score of 10 points, gradually decreasing to an intake level of 0, which received 0 points. For the moderation components, an upper limit was given in the guidelines. For example, for red meat it was recommended to eat a maximum of 45 g/d. This level of intake received 10 points, decreasing to a score of 0 points at intakes of 100 g/d or more. The optimum component (dairy product) was calculated by assigning 10 points when the intake was within the optimum range (300–450 g/d).",2c05adf3-2372-41f8-8765-a790f5a602c1
11,methods11," When intake was below the optimum range, the scores decreased linearly with lower intakes. When intake was above the optimum range, higher intakes were given linearly fewer points with a score of 0 points assigned to intakes of 750 g/d or more. The ratio components were scored by calculating the ratio between the recommended food group and the food group that needed to be replaced, and dividing this ratio by the difference between threshold and cut-off value. The maximum score of 10 points was assigned when the ratio was higher than the cut-off value, and gradually decreased to 0 points at the threshold value. In addition, for some foods a quality aspect was defined (coffee); the maximum score of 10 points was assigned if all coffee consumed was filtered or if there was no coffee consumption. If all coffee consumed was unfiltered, the score would be 0. The final DHD15-index was the sum of all components and ranged from 0 (minimal adherence) to 140 (maximal adherence).",9525e1e7-59dc-44d2-b5a1-7c231ba581a3
12,methods12,"  All-cause mortality assessment The vital status of all European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-NL participants was obtained through linkage with the municipal population registries. Participants were followed up over time until death by any cause, loss to follow-up or were censored on 1 January 2015. During a mean follow-up of 19·2 (sd 3·3) years, 3845 deaths were documented.  Lifestyle and anthropometric variables At baseline, study participants completed a standardised structured general questionnaire on the presence of chronic diseases, related potential risk factors and lifestyle factors. Blood pressure, weight and height were measured by trained staff according to standardised protocols(  23  ). BMI was calculated by dividing weight by height squared (kg/m2).",e60a1b96-aa31-4aae-bc1f-86d849e65e06
13,methods13," Physical activity was assessed with a validated questionnaire(  35  ) and classified according to the Cambridge Physical Activity Index (Cambridge Physical Activity Index (CPAI)) with imputed data for missing values (n 4930)(  36  ). The Cambridge Physical Activity Index (CPAI) is categorised into inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active and active. Smoking was operationalised as current, former and never smoker. Educational level was coded as low (lower vocational training or primary school), medium (intermediate vocational training or secondary school) or high (higher vocational training or university).

Participants with a self-reported history of cancer (n 1616), diabetes (n 759), myocardial infarction (n 514) or stroke (n 451) at baseline were excluded because their reported usual diet may not reflect their diet before diagnosis. Participants with missing information on BMI (n 17), educational level (n 191) or smoking status (n 23) were also excluded.

15,analysis1," As these are secondary analyses based on an existing large cohort with a long follow-up time, the justification for the sample size is not required.  Because the diets of men and women differ with respect to total energy intake and environmental impact, all analyses were stratified by sex. For the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and DHD15-index, tertiles of adherence were created. Because the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) ranged from 0 to 7 only, the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) was categorised into three groups with a score of 0–2, 3 and 4–7, respectively. Tabulations of sociodemographic data by Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) categories and tertiles of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and DHD15-index were made.  General linear models were used to calculate differences in mean greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and land use in the different categories of dietary indices.

In addition, we added educational level to the model in a sensitivity analysis. We assessed multicollinearity using the variance inflation factor, homoscedasticity and independence of the residuals, the mean and normality of the residuals and checked for linearity and found that all criteria were met.  Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % CI for the associations between dietary indices and all-cause mortality.

The proportional hazards assumption was checked using the Schoenfeld residuals test and showed that none of the P values were significant.

The different guidelines – and therefore the indices – have conceptual differences.",127c1c45-d3a0-4703-a688-37d1d5ebab55
29,discussion1," Despite these differences, the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and DHD15-index have quite comparable associations with all-cause mortality, and the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) and DHD15-index show comparable possible reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use of the diet in our study.  Government and health organisations promote dietary patterns linked to a broad range of positive health effects. Considering the significant environmental impact of our current diet, these diets should ideally be accompanied by lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use to meet the Food and Agriculture Organization’s definition of a sustainable diet(  37  ). In a literature review of sixteen studies by Payne et al., it is stated that dietary patterns that primarily aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions may not always improve nutritional quality or health outcomes compared with the average dietary patterns(  38  ).",a99caff1-3fe1-49df-8a80-1fe9e8bca22a
30,discussion2," Similarly, in a previous paper, we showed that total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use of the diet were not associated with all-cause mortality(  10  ). On the other hand, our current results suggest that adhering to some of the dietary guidelines will both improve health and moderately reduce environmental impact. Although diets according to guidelines most likely ensure a higher dietary quality, their links with environmental impact are less clear. A review of modelling studies showed that meeting dietary guidelines may reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 0–35 % and land use by 15–50 % compared with the average observed food consumption in a population(  39  ). However, in five of the fourteen scenarios the reduction potential was <10 %.",3aa3bad3-c204-4ff5-9425-4c3529763371
31,discussion3," Although the increased consumption of some food groups, such as fruits and vegetables, legumes and nuts, increases the environmental impact, this is usually outweighed by the lower consumption of meat and products, such as snacks, sweets and pastries(  40  ). In addition, fish consumption would have to increase to meet the recommendation, which will not only increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use (farmed fish), but it will also put pressure on wild fish stocks. However, total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will not necessarily increase when fish replaces other protein-rich foods with a higher environmental impact, such as beef(  41  ). This underlines the importance of looking at dietary patterns from both a health and an environmental perspective together to create environmentally friendly and healthy diets.",71758b19-6324-42ba-ab2e-ad7aa6f6f723
32,discussion4,"  Although limited to two studies, environmental impact has been studied for the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI)(  42  ) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet(  43  ) before. Green et al. (  42  ) modelled and optimised the current UK consumption to completely match the WHO guidelines and showed a possible 17 % reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The difference found by the authors was larger than we observed in our study (category 3 (4–7 points) v. category 1 (0–2 points): 4 % lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in women and 9 % in men), but we compared categories of adherence and did not model the impact when all recommendations are completely met (mean score was 4·5 out of a possible 7 in the highest category). In addition, this was an optimisation study in which specific foods with a low environmental impact were selected to replace unhealthy foods instead of observing actual food intakes as in our study. Monsivais et al.",294be036-012f-46e6-bb4b-7dbe82970633
33,discussion5," (  43  ) studied the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet within the UK population of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the highest quintile of adherence were 17 % lower than in the lowest quintile. We observed a small increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (a not significant increase of 0·6 % for men and a significant 2·3 % increase for women) between the lowest to the highest tertile of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. There is a noticeable difference between our studies in the calculation of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. We analyse the foods in g/d, whereas Monsivais et al. used food groups expressed as energy percentage.",72fc3775-8c30-4eec-bdac-ef4bfb1eae62
34,discussion6," Low-fat dairy product consumption is promoted in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, but the mean consumption and the variation in consumption in the UK cohort are much lower than in our population (174·9 (sd 104·0)(  44  ) v. 250·8 (sd 209·1) g/d). As the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score is based on quintiles of intake, the difference between the consumption in Q5 and Q1 of low-fat dairy product is much larger in our population than in the UK one. Consequently, the difference in environmental impact of this food group is also much larger because dairy product is a major contributor to total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Total dairy product is on average responsible for 25 % of the diet-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our population(  10  ). Also, differences between quintiles of the total Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (Monsivais et al. (  43  )) are expected to be larger than between tertiles (our study).",52735196-6426-49bc-9156-f434fb1b2736
35,discussion7," Combined, these factors may account for the small increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our cohort compared with the decrease observed in the UK cohort.  Previously, higher levels of adherence to the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) were inversely associated with all-cause mortality risk in two European population studies with similar risk estimates as we present here(  19  ,  45  ). The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with lower all-cause mortality in older adults(  46  ) and adults with hypertension(  47  ), similar to our results. For the previous DHD-index, based on the Dutch guidelines from 2006, supporting evidence of the overall association with all-cause and cause-specific mortality is inconclusive(  20  –  22  ), whereas the new DHD15-index is clearly associated with mortality in our population.  Energy intake is correlated with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.",bd82d3ca-55c1-484c-8954-7c467c24f8f7
36,discussion8," In a UK population, for every 4184 kJ (1000 kcal) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased by, on average, 3 kg CO2-eq(  43  ). Therefore, we adjusted our analysis for energy intake to independently study the effect of dietary quality on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use. We can conclude that at equal energy intake adhering to the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) (only for land use) and the DHD15-index is better for the environment. Taking the obesity trend in the Netherlands into consideration, not only dietary quality should be improved, but also the limiting of energy intake should be crucial. Besides reducing the burden of disease associated with overweight and obesity(  48  ), this would also reduce the environmental impact of our diet by less food being eaten.",49cec0fe-b20b-453b-804f-2f386e0b6df6
37,discussion9," A modelling scenario in the US in which the energy intake was reduced to maintain a healthy body weight without changing the actual food mix resulted in an approximate reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 9 %(  49  ).  The reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are observed in our study are only moderate, but are accompanied by a clear reduction in mortality risk. The added value of sustainability aspects in nutritional guidelines would be that consumers would learn what the healthy foods are and could combine this with the sustainable choice between food groups and also within each food group(  50  ). However, to achieve a more sustainable food system, change should not be limited to the choices made by consumers.",5a6d893e-fa9d-4ca4-9ab3-0befe074752b
38,discussion10," Within each food group, producers, retailers and transport businesses may invest in new technologies that retain crop yield while protecting biodiversity, reuse materials, provide better storage and produce less waste to facilitate a more sustainable production of foods. This is why both aspects are combined in the UN Sustainable Development Goals under the header ‘responsible consumption and production’(  2  ). However, if the consumers’ demand for sustainable and healthy foods becomes more eminent, this might force companies to follow.  Major strengths of this study are that we used both dietary and environmental impact data of the same population and have linked these with registered mortality data. In addition, we have a large population-based cohort with a long follow-up of 19 years. We compared three different indices for healthy diets and found similar and thus robust results. Some limitations need to be addressed.",972f7be4-6e74-4f7f-b51b-670b7601ce33
39,discussion11," Our study assessed dietary intake and its environmental impact only at baseline and only in adults. We assume in our current analyses that both intake and impact are stable. However, a previous study compared the environmental impact of the Dutch diet of 2007/2010 with that of 1997/1998 and observed a 4·9 % lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in men and 7·0 % for women because of changing dietary intakes(  31  ). According to the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey, between 2012 and 2014 and 2007 and 2010, the average diet of Dutch adults showed a decrease in the consumption of potatoes, fats and oils, alcoholic beverages, dairy products, cakes and biscuits and meat v. an increase in the intake of non-alcoholic drinks and condiments and sauces. Adolescents showed similar dietary changes, but in addition fruit intake increased by 20 %.",e7cd7f5a-abd9-413d-bb83-61a219681378
40,discussion12," Not taking such dietary changes into account can result in an underestimation or overestimation of the association between the dietary patterns and mortality because participants can be misclassified. If we were to apply the Dutch guidelines to the current food consumption data, most Dutch people would not meet the guidelines at this moment(  51  ) and thus our message that dietary change is needed to increase sustainability of the diet and health remains a priority.  Under- and over-reporting of dietary energy intake might affect the associations of the dietary patterns with environmental impact. Therefore, we excluded participants in the highest and lowest 0·5 % of the ratio of reported energy intake:BMR as proxy for over- and under-reporters. The indicators for environmental impact are based on Dutch life cycle assessments (LCA) data and apply to a Dutch setting only.",47f831a7-23e2-4b6c-a59a-f877dcb61f30
41,discussion13," Our results for environmental impact of the dietary patterns may therefore not be directly extrapolated to other countries in which production methods, productivity, fossil energy use, import and export and ways of transport may differ.  In conclusion, national and international guidelines for a healthy diet are aimed at decreasing the risk of chronic diseases. If these guidelines were adhered to by a larger proportion of the Dutch population, lower risk of all-cause mortality, as well as reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use, could be achieved. The possible reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use seem to be moderate. Eating more plant-based instead of animal-based products and, according to the guidelines for a healthy diet, limiting energy intake to match energy requirement are all strategies that need to be combined and applied to maximise the health potential while limiting the environmental impact of our diet.",4cd0fcae-6fdb-4207-a4b1-1b6686708f87
