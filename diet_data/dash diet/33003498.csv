Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020190860.  dietary approaches to stop hypertension hypertension randomized controlled trial meta-analysis systematic review ==== Body pmcIntroduction  Hypertension, a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is the leading cause of premature death worldwide and accounts for ~12.8% of global deaths (1–3). Systolic BP (Systolic BP (SBP)) or diastolic BP (diastolic BP (DBP)) increased by 20/10 mmHg will increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases by two times (4, 5). However, <20% of patients with hypertension achieve effective BP control (1).",457bdd94-799a-4ded-bc42-0625d662ae54
10,results2," Therefore, lifestyle modifications, including a healthy diet, are recommended as potential therapeutic strategies (6–8).  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) diet was the most typical dietary treatment strategy for BP control. It was abundant in fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products, with more fish, nuts and legumes, and a moderate sodium restriction (9). It reduced Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) by 5.5 mmHg and 3.0 mmHg in the first Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) clinical trial 20 years ago (10). Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was effective in the reduction of BP and other cardiovascular risk factors, including blood glucose, blood lipids, body weight, and waist circumference (10–13). Hence, it was recommended in the treatment of hypertension (10–13). However, poor adherence was the main barrier, and only a small population fully adhered to the diet (3).",a0c5452c-bb94-4419-89ae-3037ff2276aa
11,results3," Inappropriate translation, low spreading velocity, difficulty to follow, and contradiction with dietary culture were the main reasons (14–17).  The modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which expanded or reduced nutrient composition based on the original Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, was one solution to poor adherence. It reduced the sodium level of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (6–3 g) to enhance the antihypertensive effect in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium research, which was the first study to modify the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (7). Many studies have been performed to assess the efficacy of modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) for hypertension patients (18–20). However, the results were inconsistent.",eefc709d-09cd-4761-877b-1f3e82a0a28a
12,results4," Some studies reported that the modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet could reduce BP (18–20), body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) (19), blood sugar (18), and lipidemia (21); while other studies suggested the modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet might increase BP (22), blood sugar (18), and insulin resistance (23). Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet for hypertension patients.   Eligible Studies and Study Characteristics  We initially identified 5,210 results through the literature search, with four studies identified through manual screening of reference lists from the included studies. After removing duplicates, 4,455 titles and abstracts were screened, and 267 articles remained for full-text review. Finally, a total of 10 studies were included (Figure 1) (7, 16, 18–20, 22, 27–30).",ccb34259-39a5-4c59-af11-433d8bf30fad

Moreover, the modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with a reduction in waist circumference and TG concentration, but no statistical differences were found in weight or TC, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and HDL concentrations. In subgroups of age, gender and control measures, analyses revealed that no association between the modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and BP reduction. Although point estimates suggested that a higher daily sodium intake enhanced the BP-lowering effect, subgroup analyses did not show statistically significant differences. Furthermore, our finding indicated that diastolic BP (DBP) reduction was more prominent in groups with a more extended follow-up period or higher body mass index (BMI).",664aa612-1dc9-492b-bc93-cfba536567c8

The modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet might have greater positive or negative effects in combination with antihypertensive treatment or have higher accordance or provision of different interventions, such as dietary advice or food supplements, however, we did not have sufficient data for these analysis.  Like previous studies (31–33), we found that the modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was significantly associated with reductions in Systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and cardiovascular risk factors. However, some discrepancies in the degree of BP and cardiovascular risk factor reduction were found.",b8b543e8-ce73-4932-8606-e1ce653c82ff
22,discussion2," We found no association between the modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and BP reduction in subgroups stratified by sodium intake and follow-up period.  The effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on BP was investigated in previous meta-analyses (10, 34–36), which were consisted with our study. However, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet reduced Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) by 4.9–7.6 and 2.6–4.2 mmHg, respectively, which were more than our results (Systolic BP (SBP): 3.26 mmHg; diastolic BP (DBP): 2.07 mmHg). The reasons might be that we contained pre-hypertensive patients. In addition, subgroup analyses found that the mean BP reduction (Systolic BP (SBP): 7.59 mmHg; diastolic BP (DBP): 4.47 mmHg) in patients with a baseline Systolic BP (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP) threshold of ≥140/90 mmHg was similar to the BP range in the previous studies. Furthermore, Filippou et al.",961e6c20-2249-4f5e-89b2-5dcdb7c42cc4
23,discussion3," (11) found that in adults with and without hypertension, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet could reduce Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) by 3.2 and 2.5 mmHg, respectively, which was similar to our study.  Wong et al. conducted a RCT at primary care institutions and showed that as follow-up time was extended, patients' dietary compliance and BP reduction decreased (37), which contradicted with our study findings. Most studies included in our study had a follow-up period of 4–12 weeks, which might have been too short to observe a decrease in dietary compliance. Thus, more studies with a longer follow-up time were still needed.  A study showed that more than 30% of hypertension cases were caused by excessive salt intake (38); thus, BP decreased with sodium intake decreased (33). However, contradictory to other studies (31), we found a lower sodium supplication could not lead to better BP reduction.",2d3591c4-f69c-4243-854d-a7e7b5e57f95
24,discussion4," This might because the modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was strict sodium restriction, which was generally as low as 3,000 mg. That also suggested that too low sodium intake did not reduce BP further but might reduce adherence to dietary treatment.  The resutls of meta-regression showed that control measures (healthy diet or common diet) appeared to be the main source of heterogeneity for Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). However, in our subgroup analysis, no matter compared with healthy diet or common diet, the modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with a significant reduction in Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), and no statistical difference was observed in the two subgroups. Thus, even in the presence of heterogeneity, we could still conclude that the modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet could reduce BP.",7cdfb591-7a71-42d3-b2f4-5ec2ae5e3700
25,discussion5,"  A previous meta-analysis showed that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with an increased HDL concentration (17), and a reduction in waist circumference (32), body mass index (BMI) (31, 32), and TG, TC, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (17). That was different from our findings, which did not show a reduction in waist circumference or TG concentration, and might be a consequence of the small sample size.  It was suggested that Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet could reduce BP and alleviate cardiovascular disease (2, 17, 39–42). Our study showed that the modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet had similar effects on BP reduction when compared with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Meanwhile, the modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet improved dietary adherence by enhancing the feasibility and acceptability of the diet.",9a10299b-dd68-4e92-add1-014be70ddd52
26,discussion6," Hence, the modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was an effective treatment for hypertensive patients.  There were some limitations to the study. First, some studies did not provide sufficient information about study design or other details. Second, the overall heterogeneity among studies was high and was partly downgraded by explanatory analyses. Third, although subgroup analyses were conducted across mean clinical thresholds in each separate trial, it was undetermined individual trial patients were above or below these preselected thresholds. Finally, the included study did not report or described the blinding process and methods in detail, thus no further analysis was performed.
