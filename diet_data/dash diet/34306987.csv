0,methods0,"  We designed a translational inpatient trial to elucidate the biological pathway leading from nutritional change, through hormonal response, reversal of urine electrolytes ratio, to BP reduction.   We initiated a single center, unblinded interventional trial chronicling the effects of transitioning from an American-style diet [9] to the Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet on BP among adults with stage 1 or 2 (systolic blood pressure of 130 to 159 mmHg or a diastolic pressure ranging from 80 to 99 mmHg).  The primary outcome measure was changes in serum aldosterone following exposure to high-potassium/low-sodium diet. The secondary outcome measure was assessing correlation between urine electrolytes ratio in spot urine (sodium to potassium) vs. electrolytes ratio in a 24-hour urine collection.  Power calculation: The trial was designed anticipating a twofold change in aldosterone levels between pre- vs postintervention with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and 80% power (n = 9).",bf843fcf-49a2-441c-9603-637c8700021c
1,methods1," However, since this is a pilot study with an exploratory nature, the recruitment goal was set at 20 participants, aiming for a frequency of 50% black and 50% white participants. Due to the difficulties of enrolling the full target cohort because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and based on the power calculations, the sample size is nine participants.  A 14-day trial duration was selected based on previous reports [19] describing this time period as the minimal required for full Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) effect on BP.  Recruitment, Inclusion, and Exclusion Criteria  All study procedures were approved by the Rockefeller University Institutional Review Board and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedure.

3,methods3," renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) axis deviation relates to any abnormality in the hormones measured on screening (renin or aldosterone). Of note, obesity is associated with renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) axis deviation as a mechanism of hypertension. Specifically, obesity and diabetes may cause hypertension by increased activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [21,22]. Various studies have revealed associations between high aldosterone levels and metabolic syndrome, CKD, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure [23,24].

BP was obtained after participants were allowed to rest for 20 minutes in a seated position with their back and arm supported, legs uncrossed, and feet flat on the floor. Three BP measurements were obtained 1 minute apart and averaged. BP was measured using a random-zero sphygmomanometer (Hawksley and Sons, Lancing, United Kingdom). Participants completed a 24-hour ambulatory BP measurements (ABPM) on days 1 and 10 using VectraCore ambulatory BP measurements (ABPM)-05 [27].

Urine electrolyte ratio reflects nutritional changes and should guide clinicians in assessing adherence to lifestyle modification.  Keywords:  Nutrition hypertension urine electrolytes aldosterone Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet ==== Body pmcIntroduction  Hypertension affects 50 million people in the United States and 1 billion worldwide and is associated with an increased risk of end-stage kidney diseaseand significant morbidity and mortality [1,2]. The cardiovascular risk associated with hypertension is continuous, independent of other risk factors, and increases starting at a blood pressure (BP) as low as 115/75 mmHg [3].",2e3cf13d-88a2-4ff2-bc1f-304b85a496e9
11,results2," Although the pathogenesis of primary essential hypertension is still not well understood, a variety of modifiable factors, such as high- sodium (Na+) and low-potassium (K+) diet, have been implicated as mechanisms. Classic studies and observational data showed that the combined effect of a low K+ and high Na+ diet on BP seems greater than either alone [4–6].  The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet), which is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods, is a proven BP- lowering intervention [1,7,8]. It is now recommended as one of the most important nonpharmacological measures to control BP [4,9] and is more effective in reducing BP than a low-salt diet for every sodium intake level [8], probably as a result of the synergistic effect with potassium [10].  Urine electrolytes ratio (i.e., sodium to potassium: U[Na+]/[K+]) is a marker for intake and correlates with BP.",f0dd408b-4f1a-4d79-93a0-3ef2a638cbe4
12,results3," High sodium intake is mirrored by increased urinary electrolytes ratio and for each increase in urine electrolyte ratio systolic and diastolic BP increase [11]. Following increased potassium consumption, urinary excretion of the access requires the secretion of sodium [12], analogous to a diuretic, which has a cardiovascular benefit [12,13].  Urine electrolyte excretion is governed by the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone [11]. Aldosterone reacts to two opposing stimuli in what is known as the aldosterone paradox; during hypovolemia, both aldosterone and angiotensin II are secreted to retain Na+ with minimal K+ secretion. In response to potassium loading, aldosterone alone, and not angiotensin II, is secreted, leading to a potassium secreting state [14].  The pivotal Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) studies were designed to establish efficacy, but not to determine the mechanism of action.",2a724cc7-2f24-4e8a-9b78-adaf1b78eb96
13,results4," Postulated mechanisms for the BP-lowering effect of the Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet include effects on natriuresis, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)), reduced adrenergic tone, and increased vascular relaxation [15–18].  However, the full cascade of steps following Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) initiation was never revealed. We designed a translational study in which participants were followed closely for physiologic changes starting from implementation of Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet until the clinical endpoint of BP reduction.  We hypothesized that transitioning from western-style diet to Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet will influence serum aldosterone concentration leading to a change in urine electrolytes ratio, and eventually reducing BP.",e39cd10e-c4d1-40d1-9005-eecfd5318d86
14,results5,"  The objective of this trial was to characterize the early sequence of events stemming from nutritional changes, leading to serum aldosterone changes, through urine electrolytes, and ending in BP reduction. Specifically, we followed changes in serum aldosterone levels throughout the intervention to determine how rapidly Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet affects aldosterone, and we compared the urine electrolyte ratios in spot urine (sodium to potassium) to the electrolytes ratio in a 24-hour urine collection as surrogates for adherence to Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet.   Participant Characteristics and Intervention  Totally, 211 potential volunteers were prescreened by phone, 24 were invited for an in-person screening, and 9 of them completed the protocol between June 2020 and August 2021.

22,discussion0," We describe a meticulously planned inpatient study performed under strict conditions characterizing early changes in the biological pathway leading from nutritional changes to BP reduction. We show that endogenous aldosterone secretion increases following exposure to a hig-potassium and low-sodium diet rising to a peak on day 5 and then decreasing, despite continuous exposure, parallel to a reversal in urine electrolytes ratio. Blood pressure was eventually reduced following nutritional changes, even though not significantly, and in contradiction to accepted paradigm that aldosterone increase leads to hypertension.  Our trial acknowledges previous findings from pivotal trials.",c1e9e164-b674-4726-9e9c-c2ed2a048f95
23,discussion1," In the Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)-sodium trial [16], the antihypertensive effect of Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) was attributed to pressure natriuresis since higher sodium increased thirst and urine volume (suggesting higher fluid intake) in patients who were prescribed a control diet [29]. It was concluded that reducing dietary sodium decreased thirst and urine volume, yet, the effect of nutritional changes was assessed 4 weeks after implementation, whereas we followed our participants from day 1. Hence, we could document how dietary sodium reduction, while increasing dietary potassium, led to increased urine volume in the first few days, demonstrating the mechanism by which Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) lowers blood pressure.  The second pivotal trial is the Cosmonaut trial where 10 males were studied under three dietary salt levels in ultralong-term- controlled conditions [30].",09b22cc7-36d9-45e7-999e-b1e1aef19f8d
24,discussion2," The authors showed that increasing salt intake gradually decreased free water clearance. This result complements ours, since we describe decreasing salt intake, while increasing potassium intake, leading to diuresis thereby lowering BP.  In a third trial, following a run-in period, 20 volunteers were randomized to eat either Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) or a control diet for two weeks. Yet, inclusion criteria set a high BMI threshold and indeed mean BMI was in the range of obesity (33.9 ± 6.6 kg/m2) [18]. This might explain how despite natriuresis, urine electrolytes ratio reversal, and blood pressure reduction, the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) axis was not involved in the cascade. The authors concluded that the mechanism was dependent on increased nitric oxide bioavailability, as measured by plasma nitrite following a stressor, that might have subsequent effects on vascular basal tone.",43906d2b-a0de-4a0a-9725-10eaaca4b276
25,discussion3,"  Our study cohort is composed of 87% Black individuals and 80% men (Table 1) as a prespecified requirement (at least 50% of participants). Extended literature addressed the higher prevalence of hypertension in this racial group [31–33], with elaborated description of related complication.  Despite unequal representation of race and sex, the results may be generalizable. On September 2021, the nephrology community accepted a revision to the recommended formula estimating GFR that excluded the race coefficient [34]. This revision was based on the notion that race is a social construct and hence does not dictate biological pathways. Thus, there is no unequivocal racial component in BP response following Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet implementation. Moreover, documented differences in blood pressure response between racial groups might represent nutritional inequities that stem from socioeconomic differences, rather than race itself [35].",9b743c3c-fe92-419e-8083-4738eaf024cf
26,discussion4," These include higher dietary salt intake [36,37] and lower K+ intake [38]. [39–41] Appel and colleagues [7] specifically studied the antihypertensive effect of the Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet according to sex and concluded that there was no difference between males and females.  Interaction between Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) axis has been examined before under different conditions. Consuming Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet for 4 weeks had a contradicting effect with inhibiting angiotensin II (angiotensin II (ANGII)) on BP, with an increase in serum aldosterone, compared to the control group receiving angiotensin II (ANGII) infusion [15]. Since angiotensin II (ANGII) inhibition causes a decrease in aldosterone, the combination of angiotensin II (ANGII) with nutritional change might obscure the preliminary peak of aldosterone attributed to the diet.",190ff970-4d5d-4ff9-ab9f-0e685e8d896f
27,discussion5," In a post hoc analysis of the Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)-SODIUM trial, serumaldosterone increased by a mean of 2 ng/dL 30 days after Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) implementation in the intervention group compared to the control group. However, this was the earliest time point assessed after initiation of intervention [42], and hence could miss the initial peak in aldosterone following implementation of high-potassium diet.  The peak in aldosterone 5 days after intervention, which parallels the decline in urine electrolytes ratio, may suggest that another building block is missing in this pathway. A change in ion channel composition in the tubule epithelium or activation may mediate the effects of the Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet. Previous studies tried to identify the relevant ion channel, based on cell cultures [43] and animal models [44], yet none had conclusive results.",a3fd8674-88d4-4ff9-8ab9-3cfed57013e0
28,discussion6,"  Previous studies reported an association between urinary [Na+/K+] ratio on spot urine samples and 24-hour urine collection but had several limitations. In a cross-sectional study, spot urine sodium ratio was compared to 24-hour collection content. 24-hour and spot sodium concentrations correlated moderately (r = 0.46) and gave a very poor understanding of the natriuresis occurring over the same 24-hour period, without relating to nutrition or potassium [45]. Correlation between Na+/K+ ratios measured in spot urine vs. 24-hour collection was found to be statistically significant in another trial, yet the authors did not address intake or response to change in diet [46]. We show for the first time that following nutritional intervention, the urine electrolytes ratio in spot vs. 24-hour urine collection correlate very well.",96c99546-78e5-47fc-8440-2cf37b72e7f8
29,discussion7," This correlation could make the collection of spot urine for ratio assessment a rapid simple tool to assess compliance with the Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet.  Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) effect was examined in response to aldosterone infusion in the presence of high and low-salt content [47]. The authors did not witness any BP reduction after induction of supra-physiologic levels of aldosterone (83.5 ± 27.9 ng/dL), and small differences between BMI of the two groups that were not controlled for in the analysis (29.5 ± 1.6 in the nutritional intervention vs. 33.8 ± 2.1 in the aldosterone infusion group) potentially had a confounding effect on the associations.  BP reductions following Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet implementation vary. In the original study of 459 participants, BP was lowered significantly in the total group by 4.5/2.7 mmHg per 24-hour ambulatory BP measurements (ABPM) after 8 weeks on the assigned diet.",53eb5f34-e30f-405b-aa2b-52b76a52e5c4
30,discussion8," In Black individuals, BP was lowered by 6.9/3.7 mmHg, in whites by 3.3/2.4 mmHg, in hypertensives by 11.6/5.3 mmHg, and in non-hypertensives by 3.5/2.2 mmHg [48]. Other studies reported different magnitudes of BP reduction, depending on the timing of measurements related to initiation of the diet, size of population, and racial diversity. It appears that the small size of our cohort had limited statistical power to detect a difference between ambulatory BP measurements (ABPM) 10 days apart, even though the effect we documented is consistent across all timepoints examined and reproduces previous trials results.  Our trial portrays a biological pathway connecting nutritional change from an American-style diet to Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet that reverses the relative intake of potassium and sodium.",1a692cf0-d852-4075-8097-3689f526b4e7
31,discussion9," Volunteers were meticulously followed in an inpatient setting where they consumed a diet of known composition while documenting changes in endogenous hormones and electrolytes, reaching a clinical end point of blood pressure reduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a well-characterized response to Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet implementation has been described.  Accurate estimation of potassium intake in free-living populations is challenging. Some investigators used urinary potassium excretion as a proxy for potassium intake. However, in contrast to dietary sodium, of which >90% is excreted in urine, the percentage of potassium intake that is excreted is much lower (typically 80%) and dependent on diet. The cascade of events begins with potassium entry into the gastrointestinal tract and subsequent changes [49] in plasma potassium concentration [50].",625d44f5-0db2-46ce-8089-26797e2e93f9
32,discussion10," This process is not entirely clear, but it is speculated to involve an enteric sensing mechanism that governs aldosterone secretion [49,51].  Aldosterone plays multiple roles in salt and water homeostasis [52] and was assigned the properties of both kaliuretic and antinatriuretic hormone, increasing the urinary Na+/K+ ratio [53]. Despite its equivocal effects on potassium excretion, in animal models, these responses were produced with supraphysiologic doses, and the kaliuretic effect emerged only when plasma potassium was above its normal value [54].  Most of aldosterone’s effects are deleterious to the cardiovascular system, yet there is a branch activated by high potassium that connects aldosterone to blood pressure reduction and a diuretic-like effect [55].",ba3603c0-2334-4c9d-a96b-fdea3d8e6c2f
33,discussion11," Aldosterone excess is associated with increased left ventricular remodeling and diastolic dysfunction even in the absence of hypertension [56], effects that are reversed by adrenalectomy or by mineralocorticoid receptor blockers [57]. Most experimental studies in animals have indicated that target-organ damage from aldosterone excess mandates high-salt intake [58]. The interaction between aldosterone and dietary salt in modulating target-organ damage in humans is less well documented and based on population studies such as the Framingham heart study [59], rather than on individual physiology.  Our study has some limitations, the most pronounced is the small sample size. The combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and the nature of the protocol, demanding participants to agree to a prolonged inpatient stay and strict dietary compliance for two weeks, may have limited recruitment.",a6218bcb-95de-4a2b-94c1-3750c30ff504
34,discussion12," This limitation decreases generalizability potential and increases the likelihood of type 2 error, where we might miss identifying a real difference between measurements. However, despite the small sample size, we were able to reject the null hypothesis and acknowledge the intervention that led to a difference in aldosterone measurements and spot urine electrolytes ratio.  Our results have clear strengths. First, the translational nature of the protocol aiming to simultaneously characterize different aspects of the biological pathway following intervention is unique. Most research in the area is based on animal models where biology is being pushed beyond physiological thresholds and hence results do not reflect the natural course of events. The participation of human subjects, under inpatient conditions, exposed to a single intervention of monitored intake and output, provides a rare and detailed insight into real-time physiology.",e7fcb9ef-3ead-4545-ae2b-bc4361905027
35,discussion13," The unique advantage of this study is the concurrent availability of biological specimens under well controlled and followed intake rather than indirect measures, such as dietary recall, combined with ambulatory BP measurements (ABPM).  In conclusion, transitioning from American-style diet to Dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet activates a biological pathway governed by aldosterone. Urine electrolytes ratio in spot urine reflects adherence to lifestyle modifications that can reduce BP. Clinicians should focus on following the ratio rather than on sodium reduction alone, as the combination of low sodium and high potassium has a synergistic effect on blood pressure reduction and cardiovascular health.
