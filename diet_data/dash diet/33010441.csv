0,background0," The association between the Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean diet (MED)) or dietary approach to stop hypertension (dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)) and cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) risk factors is well-documented. Nevertheless, a consistent relationship with the Middle East population has yet to be known. Thus, we aimed to investigate the association between dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)/Mediterranean diet (MED) and blood lipids in Iranian adults. ",edc2b2fa-558f-4023-925c-8ad23d29c686
1,methods0," Four thousand seven hundred forty participants, aged 35–70 years (mean: 50.0) participated in the Shahedieh cohort study in Yazd, Iran, were followed from 2016 until now. Participants provided dietary and blood lipid data through a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and blood samples were taken after a fasted state. We used binary logistic regression to examine the association between dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)/Mediterranean diet (MED) scores and blood lipids.   Study design and population  The present cross-sectional study was conducted on the data from recruitment phase of the Shahedieh cohort study which is part of the PERSIAN multicenter cohort study conducted on a representative sample of an adult Iranian population (age: 35–70 y). For the Shahedieh cohort study, 9971 adults living in three cities of Yazd Greater Area (Shahedieh, Zarch, and Ashkezar), located in Yazd Province, Iran, from year 2016 to present were recruited.",37fdfcc7-1d7c-47a8-bd46-9a80972f1e7e
2,methods1," Detailed information about the protocol of the PERSIAN cohort study is provided elsewhere [22]. In brief, the participants were selected by a multistage cluster random sampling method after providing written informed consent. In the case of illiterates, informed consent was obtained from their legally authorized representatives. Eligible participants were asked to provide blood samples and data on general characteristics, as well as demographic, dietary intake, smoking, and other lifestyle-related data via validated questionnaires. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were also performed on all participants. All data were collected by trained interviewers [22].  Data were provided from 9971 adults. Participants with cardiovascular disease (CVD)s including cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, stroke (n = 241), and different types of cancer (e.g.",bd327f1b-2f40-48d2-9b21-dc37b3ddfe45
3,methods2,", skin cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and bladder cancer), and a history of hematopoietic cancers (n = 29) were excluded from the study because of the possibility of a dietary modification. Data from participants with a history of fatty liver (n = 511), thyroid disease (n = 609), diabetes (n = 1684), hypertension (n = 1183), gestational diabetes mellitus (gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)) (n = 178), preeclampsia (n = 80), and participants with body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) < 18.5 and body mass index (BMI) > 40 (n = 130) were also omitted. Furthermore, we excluded participants who left > 70 items in the food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) unanswered as well as participants with under/over-reporting (e.g., daily energy intake < 800 kcal/d or > 6500 kcal/d; n = 315). The missing data consisted of 271 participants who were also excluded from the study.",75d1261e-223c-4df1-8b42-4c2cc07d0d2a
4,methods3," After the aformentioned exclusions, 4740 participants remained for the present analysis. All the experimental protocols were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Also, the present study was approved by the ethics committee of the Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences (IR.SSU.SPH.REC.1398.017).  Dietary assessment  The validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with 178 items was administered as an interview by trained interviewers to assess dietary foods and supplements [23]. The original semi‐quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) contains 168 items, then 10 additional foods commonly consumed in Yazd were added. the study of zimorovat et al. [23] indicated that: Participants attended a large long-term clinical trial were asked to complete three semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s by interview, and nine 3-day weighed dietary records (WDRs), over 9 months.",327776fb-6992-42fb-b1c2-f6e1d61aec83
5,methods4," The ICC between food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s for repeatability ranged from 0.43 (thiamin) to 0.73 (vitamin D, median: 0.56). The de-attenuated, age, sex, and education adjusted correlation coefficient between the last food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and weighted food frequency questionnaires (WDRs) ranged from − 0.05 for vitamin A to 0.41 for manganese (median: 0.26). The median exact agreement and complete disagreement between food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)3 and WDRs were 33 and 6 %, respectively. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)3 validity coefficient for vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, and zinc were 0.13, 0.62, 0.89, and 0.66, respectively, using the triads method. Study participants were asked to answer two questions about the frequency of food consumption (number of times per month, week, or day) for each of the 178 food in the past year, as well as the amount of food frequently consumed based on standard portion sizes commonly consumed by Iranians.",1459862e-779d-4a73-9c5a-9ca942b86b7c
6,methods5," All foods were converted to grams/day based on household portion size of food intakes [24]. The Iranian food composition table (food composition table (FCT)), and U.S. Department of Agriculture food composition table (FCT) for the foods that were not available in the Iranian food composition table (FCT) were used to calculate energy and nutrient intakes [25, 26].  Adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) diet  We used a modified scale constructed by Trichopoulou et al. to indicate the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet [27]. Each of the eight indicated components was assigned a value of 0 or 1, using the sex-specific median as the cutoff. For beneficial components (vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, grains, and fish), a value of 0 was considered for individuals if their consumption was below the median, and a value of 1 was considered for individuals whose consumption was at or above the median.",91e33565-acb5-4189-bc70-e181d963cf34
7,methods6," For components that are presumed to be harmful such as meat, poultry, and dairy products, individuals with below the median’s consumption were assigned a value of 1, and individuals with at or above the median’s consumption were assigned a value of 0. Finally, for fat intake, the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fats was used. Alcohol consumption was excluded from the scale because, there is no reliable data on alcohol consumption, in Iran. Thus, the total Mediterranean- diet score ranged from 0 (minimum adherence to Mediterranean diet) to 8 (maximum adherence).",e272a455-d7a4-4819-9b44-df76a09b5328
8,methods7,"  Adherence to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet  To examine the degree of adherence to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, we constructed the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) scores based on foods and nutrients emphasized or minimized in the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, focusing on eight components: high intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, dairy products, and low intake of grains, sugar-sweetened beverages (sugar sweetened beverages (SSB)) and sweets, sodium, and red and processed meats [28]. Then, subjects were categorized into deciles of foods and nutrients. participants whose consumption was in the highest decile of total grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, nuts, and legumes were assigned a score of 10; and persons whose consumption was in the lowest decile were assigned a score of 1.",2380bb57-ce1b-4c11-a7b3-e3c5e1d552cd
9,methods8," Moreover, individuals with the highest consumption of red and processed meat, sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) and sweets, and sodium were assigned a value of 1; and those with the lowest consumption were assigned a value of 10. Finally, the scores of eight components were summed up to obtain the overall dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) score for each participant. The lowest and highest dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) scores ranged from 8 (minimal adherence) to 40 (maximal adherence), respectively.  Laboratory assessment  Blood samples (25 mL) were collected from the participants after an overnight fasting state (8–12 h before blood sampling). The blood samples were aliquoted into serum, buffy coat, and whole blood samples.",b15f0d94-ddb2-4279-9839-1bdf9ccb0a69
10,methods9," Serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (low density lipoprotein (LDL)), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL)), and triglyceride (TG) were determined from the serum samples by an auto-analyzer (Analyzer BT1500) using Pars Azmun standard kits. For every batch kits, we compared with Normal control and Patient control kits. Also the auto-analyzer was calibrated regularly. The high/low lipid profile was defined based on the EAC/EAS guidelines as follows: Serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) ≥ 130 mg/dL for men and women; serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) < 40 mg/dL for men and < 50 mg/dL for women; serum TC ≥ 240 for men and women; and serum TG ≥ 150 mg/dL for men and women [29]. The calculated ratio of low density lipoprotein (LDL)/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels > 2.5 was also considered as high [30].",936940f8-507d-4f4b-98ba-47c6e4f703a6
11,methods10,"  Anthropometric measurement  Height and body weight were measured by a trained investigator. Height was measured using a wall-fixed tape measure without bumps with an accuracy of 0.1 cm. Moreover, body weight was measured while the participants were in light clothing and without shoes to the nearest 100 g using a digital scale (SECA, model 755, Germany). The body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was computed by dividing weight (kg) by height (meters) squared.  Physical activity measurement  Physical activity information was collected using the international Physical Activity Questionnaire (international Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) through face-to-face interviews every week, then it converted to the metabolic equivalent per week (MET-h/wk) [31] and classified to sedentary, moderate, and active based on the median of the MET-h/week levels.",1dcf54e9-1606-4804-977b-e33715295979

Likewise, economic status was collected using a predefined questionnaire in which the interviewers asked about house ownership, area of the house, number of bedrooms, house amenities (whether they have a freezer, washing machine, dishwasher, computer, bathroom, color television, vacuum cleaner, mobile phone, laptop, internet access, etc.) whether they travel within the country or had any foreign pilgrim trips and the number and type of car that each participant owns.",0eb7b769-7a99-4fc1-a4c4-b21edec92637

14,analysis0," The scores of the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)/Mediterranean diet (MED) diet were categorized into tertiles. Values for continuous variables were presented as mean and their standard deviation (SD). Analysis of variance and the chi-square test were performed for continuous and categorical variables respectively, to compare the general characteristics of participants across categories of dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)/Mediterranean diet (MED) scores. Binary logistic regression was fitted in several models to assess the associations between tertiles of dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)/Mediterranean diet (MED) scores and lipid profiles. Besides, analysis of covariance (and lipid profiles Besides analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)) was used for adjustment of potential confounders comparing lipid profiles between categories of dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)/Mediterranean diet (MED) scores.",1c955dd4-3ba2-48b1-98ec-9efdc5ab1c37
15,analysis1," Age (year), sex (male/female), and energy intake (kcal/day) were adjusted in the first model. Moreover, in the second model, additional adjustments were done for physical activity (inactive/moderate/active), education (illiterate/primary school/diploma/university), marital status (married/single/divorced/widow), body mass index (BMI), smoking (yes/no), and socioeconomic status (high/moderate/ low). In all these analyses, the first tertile of dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)/Mediterranean diet (MED) score was considered as a reference. By using multivariable logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio (OR) with a corresponding 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated to quantify the association of lipid profiles with dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)/Mediterranean diet (MED) diet scores.",2048aae4-21e5-43b4-ba6f-02012a5047e9
16,analysis2," The odds ratios’ trend across increasing categories of dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)/Mediterranean diet (MED) diet, was assessed using the median score in each category as a continuous variable. The adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet score was defined as high if the score was ≥ 6 points (the third tertile), medium if the score was 3–6 (the second tertile), and low if the score was ≤ 3 points (the first tertile). The same was done for the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet score, but the cut-off was ≥ 51 for the high, or 41–50 for the medium, or ≤ 40 for the low adherence category. All statistical analyses were conducted using a statistical package for social sciences (statistical package for social sciences (SPSS)), version 20 (statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) Inc., Chicago, III, USA).

23,discussion1,"  Numerous studies have reported an association between the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)s [32–34]. The more people adhere to Mediterranean diet (MED) dietary pattern, the less they have cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors [32]. It is shown that the protective effect of the Mediterranean diet (MED) pattern in individuals with history of infarction can be continued up to 4 years after the first infarction [35]. However, few have focused specifically on lipid profile as a primary outcome. Also, an updated meta-analysis that included 12 studies and 1,574,299 participants indicated that adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MED) diet was associated with a significantly lowered risk of mortality from cardiovascular diseases [36]. Previous studies have suggested that adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet might be associated with a lower risk of high TC [37].",5d534ab0-d865-465c-bced-8b62e4746ca5
24,discussion2," Besides, in agreement with our results, another study found high high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels with adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet [38].  A publication on the Nurses’ Health Study cohort (Nurses’ Health Study cohort (NHS)) with a follow-up of 24 years suggests that adherence to a dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet might contribute to a lower risk of coronary heart disease and stroke in middle-aged women [28]. Also, consistent with our results, the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet has been shown to be effective in lowering plasma TC level and low density lipoprotein (LDL)/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) ratio [39]. It is believed that the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet has a favorable effect on lipid profiles because of its beneficial components.",b2d2f49b-24ef-4009-9abf-b6ca6fb9158f
25,discussion3," Higher amounts of fruits and vegetables in the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet which increase the content of dietary fiber and phytoestrogens might respond to its beneficial effects on serum TG, total cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels [39–41]. Also, the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet contains higher amounts of non-hydrogenated vegetable oils that might contribute to favorable effects on lipid profiles. Several studies suggest that consuming edible vegetable oils has a modulating effect on blood pressure and serum lipid profiles [42, 43]. Similar beneficial effects on serum levels of TC, TG, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL)/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) ratio were found in our study as well.  It should be noted that we observed some differences between the effects of the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet and the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet on blood lipids.",25d11f64-536e-459f-a4d5-c86b713eb0f8
26,discussion4," In the present study, the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet tended to be directly associated with a high high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) level, simultaneously with lower odds of low density lipoprotein (LDL)/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) ratio, while there was no significant association between Mediterranean diet (MED) and other lipid profiles; Nevertheless, the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet performed somewhat better than the Mediterranean diet (MED), having significant inverse associations with high TC, TG, low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and the low density lipoprotein (LDL)/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) ratio. The difference in the study region between the current study and previous studies may be one of the main reasons why such results were reported. The Mediterranean diet (MED) dietary pattern in Mediterranean countries differs from other countries such as Iran [44].",7e141559-08b8-4b8a-885e-9fd787027f4f
27,discussion5," Although the most consumed cereals in Iran belong to white rice and refined grains [45], the majority of people in the Mediterranean region consume brown rice and whole grains [44]. Furthermore, the amount of fish consumed and the methods used to prepare it vary across these regions, resulting in variations in omega-3 intake. For instance, in Mediterranean countries, olive oil is consumed as a main component of the diet and also to prepare fish. The nutritional value of fish may increase due to increased intake of antioxidants, phenols, and vitamins from olive oil consumption [44]. Nevertheless, Iranian people use corn oil and sunflower oil for the preparation of fish and other foods, which contain less proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, especially oleic acid than olive oil [46].",5c31df9a-2778-4053-a06c-f3256774dceb
28,discussion6,"  An important question that arises concerning our findings is whether the non-protective effect of the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet is reliable, due to lower consumption of whole-grain foods (< 10 g/day) and more consumption of refined grains (such as rice and white bread) in Iranian population that might affect our findings [47]. Moreover, we also attempted to take lifestyle into account by adjusting all analyses for physical activity and smoking. However, the odds result from the adjusted and unadjusted models were quite similar. This finding suggests that we identified an effect of diet, rather than other factors, on the odds of lipid profile, although we cannot rule out residual confounding because of the suboptimal measurement of these factors.  This study has several limitations as follows: First, our study was a cross-sectional study; thus, determining causal relationships between observed findings and lipid profile is not possible.",26f28777-95e1-43a2-a521-372d3905b0cc
29,discussion7," We tried to minimize the potential confounding effects by excluding individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD)s, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and other chronic diseases since their serum blood lipids and also their dietary pattern might be affected. Likewise, participants who may have changed their eating habits due to illness were also excluded. Second, we used semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s to collect dietary assessment data with trained interviewers. Although using a validated questionnaire, the nature of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) is likely to cause misclassification. Third, the study was conducted on selected participants from Yazd Greater Area. Therefore, the generalization of our findings to the whole Iranian population should be done with caution. Moreover, although we tried to control the maximum number of potential confounding variables, residual confounding from unknown or unmeasured confounders cannot be excluded.",676cd1b6-6ddf-4397-8054-e7ecedf1c941
30,discussion8," On the other hand, the present study benefited from a large sample size, which might be its key strength. The study also exploited the information available on several non-dietary variables, allowing us to control for their supposed confounding effect in the analyses.  Conclusions  The current large-scale cross-sectional study suggests a positive association between the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and serum levels of TC, TG, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL)/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) ratio, whereas the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet could increase the high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and decrease low density lipoprotein (LDL)/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) ratio. Further large-scale prospective studies are highly recommended to confirm our findings.",4f9ded12-ef70-4214-884a-0958228d9087
