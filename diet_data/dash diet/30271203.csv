0,introduction0,"Obesity represents a rapidly growing public health problem worldwide over the last few decades1. Epidemiological studies have shown that combinations of obesity and metabolic abnormalities lead to increased risk of chronic diseses, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular diseases (CVD)), and all-cause mortality2,3. Recently, it has been shown that even individuals in the same body mass index category can have different levels of metabolic components, including lipid profiles, blood glucose, blood pressure, and waist circumference3.",1b9da924-e127-46b5-aaad-c993d2ee5dd5
1,introduction1," Among obese individuals, two phenotypes, including subjects with normal metabolic characteristics as the metabolically healthy obese (metabolic healthy obesity (MHO)) phenotype, and those with metabolically unhealthy status as the metabolically unhealthy obese (metabolic unhealthy obesity (MUHO)) phenotypes have been defined4,5, the long-term health outcomes of the metabolic healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolic unhealthy obesity (MUHO) phenotypes are still not fully understood6; one study reported that both metabolically healthy and unhealthy obese individuals are faced with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and mortality7; however, the Hamer et al. study indicates that compared with the metabolically healthy nonobese participants, metabolic healthy obesity (MHO) was not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and all cause mortality8.",cfa38e1e-2176-4a14-a6d3-4d1b940c3967
2,introduction2," Also, some evidence shows that the metabolically unhealthy obese phenotype had higher risk of chronic diseases, compared to the healthy one9.  Dietary patterns along with physical activity are important environmental factors that contribute to the progression of obesity and metabolic disorders10,11. Considering that meals, include a wide variety of foods with various mixtures of nutrients, which may have interactive effects, investigating dietary patterns is essential for providing valuable information, beyond individual nutrients or food groups12. The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) diet, a dietary pattern, currently receiving much attention, was originally designed to reduce blood pressure13; this diet emphasizes intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, moderate amounts of low-fat dairy; and underscores reduced intakes of red or processed meats, sodium, and sweetened beverages13.",5ef1a9e1-5ff9-43ea-9630-b0cebe029771
3,introduction3,"  Some studies with controversial results have explored the association between healthy diet indices such as Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, Mediterranean diet, and food pyramid compliance with odds of obesity phenotypes14,15; although greater adherence to the Mediterranean was positively associated with metabolic healthy obesity (MHO), compared to metabolic unhealthy obesity (MUHO), and higher adherence to Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score was related with lower odds of metabolically unhealthy normal weight phenotype in comparison to metabolically healthy normal weight younger adults, no significant association of Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index with obesity phenotypes was found in the elderly15. It has been reported that higher compliance to food pyramid recommendations but not Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score is favorably related to metabolic healthy obesity (MHO)14.",37194000-e3f5-4f6d-bacb-aaf771e01a14
4,introduction4," Since prevention of obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases is an enormous medical and socioeconomic task, and extremely important in terms of cost effectiveness16, the determination and assessment of enviromental factors such as dietary patterns which protect obese individuals against obesity-related metabolic diseases is vital. We therefore aim to investigate associations of higher adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet with metabolically healthy and unhealthy obesity phenotypes among an Iranian population.

5,methods0,"Subjects The current study was conducted within the framework of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS)), a population-based prospective study, aimed at determining the risk factors for non-communicable diseases among a representative urban population of Tehran, including 15005 participants, aged ≥3 years. The first survey of Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) began in 1999 and data collection, conducted at 3-year intervals, is ongoing. The baseline survey was a cross-sectional study, and surveys II, III, IV, and V were prospective follow-up surveys17,18.

7,methods2,"  Measurements Details of the study method and measurements have been reported previously18–21. Dietary data over the previous year were collected using a valid and reliable semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire at baseline22. Trained dieticians asked participants to designate their consumption frequency for each food item during the previous year on a daily, weekly or monthly basis; portion sizes of consumed foods, reported in household measures, were then converted to grams21. Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score in the Fung et al. study23 was determined based on eight components, i.e. higher intakes of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts, and low-fat dairy and lower intakes of red or processed meats, sodium, and sweetened beverages. The intake of each food component was energy adjusted (g/1000 kcal) and then categorized into quintiles.",46ca5cc7-570e-4c17-95b5-9969fd87735b
8,methods3," Subject’s quintile rankings were used for whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts, and low-fat dairy to determine component scores, e.g. participants in the lowest quintile were recieved 1 point, and those in the highest one were recieved 5 points. For sodium, red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened beverages, those in the lowest quintile were assigned 5 points, and those in the highest one were assigned 1 point. We then summed up the scores for all the eight components to compute the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. Thus, the total Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score ranged from 8 (minimum adherence) to 40 (maximal adherence).  A trained interviewer used a pretested questionnaire to collect data on age, sex, medical history, medication use, and smoking habits. Smoking status was defined as nonsmoker and smoker (ex-smoker, current or occasionally). Education level was categorized based on years of education (≤12 years, >12 years).",2692dcaf-2f8c-4f1a-a8f1-98749adb4d5e
9,methods4," To collect physical activity, we used the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ)), which has been previously modified and validated among Iranians24. The participant’s weight, height, waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)), and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) were measured based on standard protocols as previously described19,21. Body mass index was computed as weight (kg) divided by height (m2). A blood sample was taken at the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) research laboratory in a sitting position after 12–14 h of overnight fasting according to the standard protocol to measure fasting plasma glucose (fasting plasma glucose (FPG)), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)19,20.",2f318f00-6f19-4282-8b41-a8bcf7e3df3c
10,methods5,"  Definitions Obesity phenotypes, including metabolic unhealthy obesity (MUHO) and metabolic healthy obesity (MHO) were defined based on the Joint Interim Statement (Joint Interim Statement (JIS)) criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetS)25. Participants were considered as having metabolic unhealthy obesity (MUHO) if they had ≥2 of the following: WC ≥ 91 cm in women and ≥89 cm in men26; fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 100 mg/dl or drug treatment; fasting TGs ≥ 150 mg/dl or drug treatment; fasting HDL-C <50 mg/dl in women and <40 mg/dl in men or drug treatment; raised blood pressure defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 130 mmHg/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 85 mmHg or antihypertensive drug treatment.

19,discussion1," Considering that the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score is a discrete variable with a narrow range between 8–40 (the range of this score in our population was from 9 to 37). When we analyzed the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score as a continuous variable, the statistical significance of findings was attenuated and our results no longer remained significant. It should be noted that in the epidemiological studies, variation in the exposure variable among the study population is so important and for simplicity of interpretation of results and their clinical applicability, studies mainly focus on high and poor quality diet, which can be attained by categorizing the exposure variable. Therefore, similar to more than 90% of other nutritional studies, we categorized Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score in to tertiles in addition to the using it as a continuous variable.",a362dad4-64cc-4242-8a6c-6654898ac879
20,discussion2," Categorizing Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is helpful to determine more considerable associations with metabolic health status in obese participants.  Previously, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet, Mediterranean diet, healthy eating index (healthy eating index (HEI)), and food pyramid recommendation scores have been assessed with metabolic status in obese individuals and controversial findings were reported14,15,27. The Camhi et al. study indicates that healthy eating index (HEI) significantly differed between metabolic healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolic unhealthy obesity (MUHO) phenotypes among women aged 19–44 years; however, no significant difference was observed among men and elderly women27.

The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) style diet emphasizes increased intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy, and dietary fiber, and reduced intakes of red meat and sugar-sweetened beverages, all of which are closely associated with decrease in risk of metabolic abnormalities30–35.

25,discussion7," It is suggested that high dietary fibre attenuates indicators of metabolic abnormalities such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG), TGs, BP and WC38; another mechanism suggested is the higher intakes of low-fat dairy via the effects of calcium on insulin sensitivity, WC, BP, and lipid profiles30,40. Also, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietry pattern contains high levels of potassium, magnesium, vitamin C, and phytochemicals, which reduce the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and MetS39.  The current study has several strengths. This study is the first large size population-based study to examine the association between Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and different phenotypes of obesity in the Middle East and North Africa (Middle East and North Africa (MENA)) region.
