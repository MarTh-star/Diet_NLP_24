0,introduction0,"According to the WHO Health Statistics 2012, the global prevalence of raised blood pressure (BP) (systolic blood pressure (SBP): ≥140, diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)): ≥90) in males and females aged ≥25 years was 29.2% and 24.8%, respectively [1]. Similar percentages were observed in the Hong Kong Population Health Survey 2003/2004, in which the overall hypertension prevalence among people aged ≥15 was 27.2%, with 30.2% in males and 24.9% in females [2].  Globally, increased BP has been reported as the top behavioral and physiological risk factor (13%) for attributable deaths [1]. By estimation, 51% of stroke deaths and 45% of coronary heart disease deaths were caused by increased BP [1]. Besides, high BP also increases the chance of having heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease. The positive association between BP and cardiovascular diseases has been supported by consistent evidence [3].",70a8de82-3271-4d86-9b7b-6031c16b577e
1,introduction1," Prospective observational studies estimated a 5–6 mmHg increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) could lead to increased risk of stroke and ischemic heart disease by approximately 35–40% and 20–25%, respectively [4]. Given such global burden of disease, it is of high importance to achieve optimal BP control in the population.  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) is currently recommended as one of the essential lifestyle measures for controlling BP in international guidelines [3], [5]–[7]. It is a diet which recommended higher consumption of whole grain, fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, lean meat, poultry and fish, and nuts and legumes. It is rich in potassium, magnesium, calcium, and dietary fiber, while limiting the intake of total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. Daily dietary sodium is restricted to 2300 mg.",29c0ad7f-2fda-41ac-a9e9-b540c4e8cbf7
2,introduction2," The original Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) feeding trial, in which subjects were provided with all their food, demonstrated a significant reduction of SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in patients with stage 1 hypertension by 11.4 and 5.5 mmHg net of the control, respectively (p<0.001 for both) [8]. Such BP lowering effect occurred within 2 weeks. Other intervention studies focusing on dietary education, which included face-to-face dietary counseling by dietitian, phone calls, and mailings, also observed a significant reduction of SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranged 5.6–11.2 mmHg and 4.1–7.5 mmHg respectively [9]–[11].  However, although the efficacy of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet to effectively lower BP has been demonstrated, information regarding the assessment methods and degree of compliance to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet following dietary intervention is limited.",1cb12dca-c035-4216-93b0-36d65f13e993
3,introduction3," The major landmark studies on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet are feeding trials with all food provided to the participants, which may limit generalization of the findings to clinical settings where intervention is mainly based on counseling. A better understanding on the methods used to examine compliance will help researchers to evaluate the impact of the intervention, and hence to develop effective strategies to improve the dietary compliance and optimize patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to systematically review the assessment methods used in previous Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trials and the corresponding compliance level to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet among the participants.

Feeding trials In the original Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) feeding trial of 459 free-living persons, excellent adherence was reported by both objective and subjective measures [13]. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial was conducted to assess the effects of three dietary patterns on BP, including control, increased fruits and vegetables, and combination diets. Subjects attended 3 weeks run-in of control diet, followed by 8 weeks of intervention feeding. Non-study foods and beverages were restricted. Objective adherence measures included meal attendance, measurement of body weight, and urinary excretion (sodium, potassium, phosphorus and urea nitrogen).",a9b83dc7-770f-4bbe-90f3-54b761e75185

Similar levels of adherence were obtained from anonymous surveys. The overall mean adherence score also indicated a nearly perfect adherence.  Other intervention studies Various methods were used in the literature to assess the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) compliance in the intervention studies, including construction of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score based on dietary intake, assessment of achievement of defined Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary patterns, and the examination of urinary excretion.  a.",949a936c-99d0-4bc8-a4e4-5361d36a1c35
15,results9," Compliance level measured by Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score A scoring system was adopted by several studies to assess the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) compliance. The recent ENCORE study used a composite index of adherence, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Adherence Score, for assessment [14]. This was a 4-month clinical trial enrolled with 144 overweight and obese adults with suboptimal BP (SBP: 130–159 mmHg, and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP): 85–99 mmHg). Participants were randomized into 1 of the 3 groups: Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) alone (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-A), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) plus behavioral weight management (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-WM), or usual diet control (UC).",eb2d6873-96cf-4b59-924c-8c1abeff87ec

Additional calorie restriction, behavior modification, and aerobic exercise sessions were included in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-WM group. The UC group was asked to keep their daily routine for diet and exercise. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence score was constructed based on dietary information from a validated food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)). This was a composite score, composing of sub-scores from 10 food and nutrient components (grains; fruits; vegetables; nuts, seeds, and legumes; dairy; meat; fat; saturated fat; sweets; and sodium). A score of 0 to 1 was given to each component based on intakes compared to the recommendations, yielding a maximum total score of 10.",fd68f403-b7e2-4bc8-a12f-4b66ea00393b
17,results11," The mean post treatment total adherence scores were 6.60, 6.24, and 3.62 in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-WM, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-A, and UC group respectively.  Another Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Adherence Index was constructed by Obarzanek et al. to measure the overall compliance to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet in the PREMIER trial [15]. PREMIER was a randomized controlled trial with 18 months intervention period. Seven hundred and eighty two participants aged ≥25 with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension were randomized into 1 of the 3 treatment groups: “Established” (receiving established recommendations for BP control), “Established Plus Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)” (receiving established recommendations and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet recommendations), or advice control group (receiving information about lifestyle factors that control BP).",f67bcc9e-0486-4ed9-8df0-4edb6f89b553
18,results12," Participants in the “Established Plus Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)” group were encouraged to achieve the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) goals, which included increasing daily intake of fruits and vegetables (9–12 servings), and low-fat dairy products (2–3 servings), while reducing intake of saturated fat (≤7% energy). Three sub-indices were constructed based on two 24-hour dietary recalls in relation to the above 3 goals. A score of 0–1 was assigned when intake was within the target range. Participants with intake better than the target range were given a score higher than 1, while those with worse intake were given with a score below 0. The average of these 3 sub-indices represented the overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence. At 6 months and 18 months, a near zero adherence score was reported in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group, which was higher than that in the other 2 treatment groups.",15cf3ff8-8b15-4d65-8c30-8aca162bef67
19,results13,"  Under another randomized prospective trial, 2 studies examining the effects of different interventions on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) compliance using Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score were identified [16], [17]. This trial involved 210 participants aged ≥60 years with hyperlipidemia and/or hypertension. Participants were randomized into 4 groups for 52 weeks, including information group, therapeutic meals group, medical nutrition therapy (Medical nutrition therapy (MNT)) group, and Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) plus therapeutic meals group. Dietary intakes were assessed using 24 hour recalls. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was calculated based on the recommendations for 9 nutrients (protein, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, fiber, magnesium, calcium, potassium, and sodium). Meeting a nutrient target scored one point, and a maximum total score of 9 could be obtained.",c3eceec7-50e6-43f8-a26a-ca715192cb0d
20,results14," An intermediate Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was also calculated, in which meeting an intermediate target and a nutrient target gained 0.5 points and 1 point, respectively.  The study by Troyer et al. [16] was the main study focusing on the dietary changes between those received and not received therapeutic meals, while the study by E. Racine et al. [17] was the sub-analysis of the effectiveness of Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) versus education information on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet knowledge.

29,discussion0,"This review demonstrated there were a great variety of methods used in assessing Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) compliance, and there was no existing gold standard consensus for the best approach. Both objective and subjective methods were identified. Each method may have advantages, as well as disadvantages. Urinary excretion is the most objective biochemical indicator for the dietary intake of several nutrients. It is easily accessible and is an assessment method that is independent of the respondent's memory [21]. However, there are factors affecting the agreement between the urinary excretion and dietary intake, including the completeness of sampling and the hydration status of subjects [22]. Also, the assessment of urinary excretion might only reflect intake of several nutrients, failing to capture the overall dietary consumption.",a9f28caa-047c-4600-8061-b1ea845b7070
30,discussion1," In contrast, using Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score or achievement of the defined Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is a subjective approach to assess Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) compliance. This method uses self-reported data of dietary intake obtained by dietary recalls or food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to compare with recommendations. This enables the researchers to attain additional information on the type and quantity of foods consumed by individuals, indicating the overall diet quality. However, this is subject to the inherent limitations of the dietary assessment methods used, for example, the response bias and recall bias [21]. It will be the most comprehensive if both objective and subjective methods were used. The objective measurement serves as a validity check for the subjective dietary assessment.",94cff627-3b06-46f4-bd80-7705bc87efb9
31,discussion2," However, the choice of the most appropriate assessment method depends on the study outcomes, the characteristics of the study population, and the resources available.  Although it was less possible to directly compare the compliance level among the included studies due to the heterogeneity in the methodology, it was found that the degree of compliance varied with the study design. It is of no surprise that excellent adherence was reported in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) feeding trial as food was provided to the patients. However, when it changed to a “real world setting” where participants were given dietary advice for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) instead of providing food items, a lower level of adherence was reported.",d3ff089f-f64d-4a31-88de-a5481cdfc33c
32,discussion3," The ENCORE study reported a mean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score of around 6 (out of a maximum 10) in both the intervention groups with Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) [14], while studies by Troyer et al.[16] and Racine et al.[17] reported a score of approximately 2 (maximum: 9) after intervention. Only 21% of the participants achieved the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) targets for fruits, vegetables, and saturated fat after dietary counseling in a 3-month randomized intervention study [9]. Moreover, decrease in compliance with time after intervention was noticed in 4 of the studies reviewed [9], [15]–[17], indicating it was also challenging to maintain the adherence to specific dietary advice. However, the standard for good Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) compliance was not well defined and the judgment for the level of compliance remained uncertain.",e682d104-c355-4a8b-ad75-06b3237dde39
33,discussion4,"  Despite the fact that patients might not have perfect adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, previous studies showed significant improvements in dietary intakes among subjects with dietary intervention. Participants in the PREMIER study showed a significant decrease in total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol intake, while increase in intake of dietary fiber and many vitamins and minerals after intervention [23]. Similar improvements in dietary fat and minerals such as potassium, magnesium and sodium were demonstrated in other studies [9], [20]. Dietary improvements were accompanied by positive BP changes [9], [18]–[20], [24]. The recent ENCORE study demonstrated that Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence score was an independent predictor of SBP, in which every 2-point increase in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence score was associated with a reduction of 3.4 mmHg in SBP [14].",5492e146-c51a-45ac-8e87-a37a15f5a2db
34,discussion5," This is of great importance in the management of hypertension. In the recent 7th report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, it was estimated that a 5 mm Hg decrease in SBP in the population would result in overall reduction in mortality due to stroke, coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality by 14%, 9% and 7% respectively [3]. Other prospective cohort studies in the literature revealed that a diet more consistent to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) was associated with a lower rate of heart failure [25], [26], a lower risk of coronary heart disease and stroke [26], and a lower incidence of diabetes [27]. All these provide supporting evidence to promote the adoption and adherence to this dietary plan.  The major limitations of the present review were the scarcity of eligible studies and the substantial variability between them.",3b57c433-5f19-4a4e-a20a-ffbcfaa29fd0
35,discussion6," Only very few studies were found in the literature consisting of both the assessment method for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) compliance and an intervention arm for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). Many studies were observational in nature, examining the association between the consistency with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and risk of developing different diseases. The very few studies identified also differed in study design and outcomes. This inherent lack of homogeneity between the included studies made it hard to perform a meaningful comparison. In addition, the restriction of search results to English language might lead to the exclusion of potentially relevant studies and this contributed to another limitation of the current review.",0d19d6a5-0f12-40d3-aef0-d4b56e75924f
36,discussion7,"  Conclusion This systematic review outlines a wide range of methods used to assess the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) compliance level, which is an indispensable part in evaluating the impact of the dietary intervention. However, no consensus existed regarding the best approach. Despite the heterogeneity in the methodology and the study design, compliance level to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was generally low when only counseling service was given without food supplies. Given the potential health benefits of this dietary plan, there is a need for future research to establish the gold standard for examining Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) compliance, and to study the barriers for adopting dietary changes. It might also be of interest to develop and integrate an individual compliance assessment component into the education program, serving as a self-monitoring tool to enforce the implementation of dietary modifications.",556295e7-d28d-4227-ae9d-0502d10ccd24
