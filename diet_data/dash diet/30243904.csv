1,methods1," Simultaneous measurements of both Vm and [Cl−]i in cells by co‐expression of the voltage and Cl sensor were not feasible because of the large overlap of the two emission spectra of CFP and EYFP.  2.2 Measurement of Vm, and [Cl−]i using the Flex station microplate reader HEK cells transfected with the K+ channel KCNJ10, and the voltage‐sensitive dye VSFP3.1 (encoded by pcDNA3.1 (−), Addgene) were used to measure the change in Vm at an absorption and emission wavelengths of 444 and 535 nm, respectively. HEK cells transfected with the chloride sensor, pcDNA3.1 (+) EYFP H148Q/I152L (Addgene), KCNJ10, Clc‐kb and barttin were used to measure the change in [Cl−]i at an absorption and emission wavelengths of 485 and 555 nm, respectively.  Immediately before the Flex station measurements, 96‐well plates with the adhered HEK cells were washed with a solution containing 130 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaI, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3.",0a751576-e8a6-4c56-8f79-a8ebf43588bc

NaCI was included only in the solutions which were used for [Cl−]i measurement. Solutions with different external KCl concentrations were introduced to the cells in each well after 50s of baseline measurement (the concentration of NaCl was adjusted in each case to maintain the osmolality of the solution). Appropriate negative controls were employed, and selective blockers including DIDS (Sigma) (L'Hoste et al., 2013), Valsartan (Sigma) , Tertiapin Q (Abcam) (Doupnik, 2017), and Ba (Sigma) were used as indicated.

8,results0,"3.1 Measurement of change in membrane potential (Vm) Cells transfected with the voltage‐sensitive VSFP3.1 exhibited a typical CFP (cyan fluorescent protein, emission max at 535 nm) emission spectrum that was sensitive to membrane depolarization when the [KCl]o was changed progressively from 2 through 5 mM KCl (Figure 1a). This effect of increase in external K+ resulted from increasing quenching of the CFP fluorescence (Figure 1a) over the range of [KCl]o used, the normalized change in fluorescence (ΔF/Fo) exhibited a log‐linear relationship with increasing external KCl (Figure 1b), showing that the membrane functions as a K+ electrode. The fluorescence quenching in 5 mM [KCl]o was affected by the presence of the K channel blockers Ba2+ or Tertiapin Q (Figure 1c); Ba2+ abolished the quenching almost completely, while Tertiapin Q (50nM)`reduced it to about 10%.",0cf10eff-a4bb-4435-9e88-df3f9972fc82

About 10 mM NaI was used in all our experimental solutions, based on previous work with this fluorophore (Johansson, Norris, & Peilot‐Sjogren, 2013) showing that 10 mM NaI was an optimal concentration for assay performance while ensuring that there is no artifact of agonist‐independent I‐ permeability of the cells.

DIDS (4,4′‐Diisothiocyanatostilbene‐2,2=‐ disulfonic acid), an inhibitor of Cl− flux (Wulff, 2008), abolished the EYFP quenching almost completely, suggesting that the K effect on Cl− influx and intracellular EYFP depends on the expressed Clc‐kb channel, whereas Valsartan  was less effective in comparison to DIDS. Tertiapin Q also reduced the EYFP quenching by about 50%, suggesting that K+ influx into the cells through KCNJ10 was necessary for the subsequent Cl− influx, and EYFP quenching (Figure 2c).  3.",435fcbbf-3775-41c0-b00d-62cb4d1f61ed
13,results5,"4 Extracellular KCl affects phosphorylated WNK4 (pWNK4) levels in NCC and WNK4 transfected cells Having observed the sensitivity of the “model HEK cell” membrane to coupled changes in [KCl]o and transmembrane Cl− movement, the consequence for the cellular WNK4/SPAK/NCC signaling pathway was investigated. Altering [KCl]o had distinct effects on the phosphorylation status of the different forms of WNK4 in the transfected cells. WNK4 WT was affected inversely with pWNK4 levels falling (Figure 3a) when [KCl]o was increased from 2 to 3 mM and above. A steep fall in pWNK4 levels was observed upon changing the [KCl]o from 2 to 3 mM with a further small reduction in its levels between 3 and 5 mM KCl (Figure 3b). The K channel blocke,r Tertiapin Q, abolished this effect on WNK4 WT levels (Figure 3c), demonstrating the role of the KCNJ10 channel in mediating the effect of changing [K+]o on WNK4 levels.",4d865a70-50fc-4f4d-b2a7-7f2c8d233220
14,results6," Increasing [K+]o did not affect the intensities of the Cl insensitive mutant WNK4 LLFF (Figure 3d), confirming the role of the Cl binding domain of WNK4. Finally replacing WT WNK4 with the WNK4 LF kinase‐dead markedly reduced or abolished p WNK4 levels showing the importance of the kinase domain for the changes seen in pWNK4.

Both pSPAK (Figure 4a) and pNCC (Figure 4c) levels decreased with increasing [KCl]o in the model HEK cells expressing WNK4 WT. This fall in pSPAK levels with an increase in [KCl]o from 2 to 5 mM (Figure 4b) possibly explains the decline in the phosphorylation of NCC at a similar range of concentrations of [KCl]o.",0e6c8a7d-8e69-41ae-bfb0-be5cfc78cf2e
16,results8," The levels of pNCC is a linear function of [KCl]o within the range of 2 to 5 mM, and the slope of the trendline is comparable (Figure 4d) to the one observed when the pNCC levels were plotted against a similar range of plasma [K+] (in the mice untreated with aldosterone) in the in vivo study (Terker, Zhang, et al., 2016). With pNCC being a marker for NCC activity (Pacheco‐Alvarez et al., 2006), the effect of [KCl]o on pNCC suggests that the NaCl entry via NCC would be reduced at physiologically viable higher [K+]o due to its restricted activity.

18,discussion0," Although K+ is the most abundant exchangeable cation in the human body, with an intracellular concentration of 140–150 mM, the serum [K] is normally maintained within a smaller physiological range, 3.5–5 mM. Earlier animal studies have shown that a large increase in dietary K+ affects the abundance and activity of the cotransporter NCC ; however, a recent paper (Terker, Zhang, et al., 2016) has demonstrated that K+ is a pivotal modulator of NCC at a physiologically relevant concentration, and proposed a possible mechanism (“Ellison hypothesis”) to explain this. Our in vitro study is a working model of this hypothesis, where the physiological and molecular effects of changing [K+]o on intracellular Cl and the WNK/SPAK/NCC pathway (involved in regulating salt transport across the distal convoluted tubule (DCT)) has been shown in a “distal convoluted tubule (DCT)‐like” HEK cell system.",503d1e14-20b5-49ba-8fa6-4a6b6d7d1ca1
19,discussion1,"  Using a CFP fluorescence‐based approach in the model HEK cell system, we have shown that the cell membrane functions as a K+ electrode which responds to small, step‐wise changes of 1 mM KCl when the [K+]o is increased from 2 mM through 5 mM in cells expressing KCNJ10. Significant reduction in EYFP fluorescence was detected as [KCl]o was increased, indicating an inverse relation of EYFP fluorescence quenching to increased [K+]o. Blockers such as Tertiapin Q and BaCl2 abolished these effects of changing [K+]o, demonstrating the role of the K channels on the distal convoluted tubule (DCT)‐like cell membrane (including KCNJ10), whereas the ClC channel blockers affected EYFP quenching which is a consequence of Cl− influx across the membrane, and binding of these anions to the EYFP protein.",64b5ba8d-f1b5-481f-8fbd-e1374c552f3b
20,discussion2," Thus our model cells mimics the hypothesized behavior of distal convoluted tubule (DCT) cells and confirms they can respond to small changes in [K+]o within the physiological range followed by transmembrane anion transport through ClCs.  The model HEK cells expressing WNK4 or its mutant forms respectively responded differently to altering [K+]o in the physiologically relevant range of 2 to 5 mM. The [K]o affected the activity of WNK4/SPAK/NCC signaling and its downstream targets in this model cell line as determined by measuring the levels of pWNK4, pSPAK, and pNCC level, respectively. The inverse effect of increasing [K+]o on pWNK4 levels in cells expressing wild‐type WNK4 was abolished by K channel blockers (tertiapin and Ba2+), thus confirming that distal convoluted tubule (DCT) K channels (such as KCNJ10) are the route for K entry into these cells, which facilitates the subsequent effects on the WNK4/SPAK/NCC pathway as observed in in vivo studies .",71f242af-3fce-438b-b214-f430dd8b5fb2
21,discussion3," The absence of a similar K+ sensitivity to the phosphorylation states of the same proteins in cells expressing the Cl− insensitive mutants, WNK4 LLFF and WNK4 LF KD respectively, emphasises the importance of the WNK4 Cl− binding and kinase domains for transducing the membrane potential changes caused by altered [K+]o.  WNK4 has been shown to be the most responsive WNK family member to changes in [Cl−] (Terker, Zhang, et al., 2016), so it appears to be the key sensor of [K+] in distal convoluted tubule (DCT) cells where [Cl−]i is typically around 10–20 mM (Weinstein, 2005). Our model HEK cells behave like the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) cells, with the downstream signaling targets of WNK4, the SPAK and NCC showing a corresponding decrease in their phosphorylation levels at [K+]o of 5 mM. Although WNK1 has been reported to be the [K+] sensor in HEK cells (Terker et al.",a19f54f2-b145-442a-b6f9-5d464fc0bb0f
22,discussion4,", 2015) (due to its higher [Cl−]i of >40 mM), the exogenously expressed WNK4 in our model cell probably functions as the primary sensor due to its much greater abundance over WNK1.  The abundance of both pSPAK and pNCC in our in vitro study showed an inverse relationship to the increase in [K]o, and interestingly, the pattern of pNCC reduction with [K]o was comparable to the one observed in aldosterone untreated mice in in vivo. However, in the same study aldosterone‐treated mice showed a much steeper decline in pNCC abundance with an increase in plasma [K+] (Terker, Zhang, et al., 2016), suggesting a role for aldosterone in ameliorating the phosphorylation and thus activation of NCC at low plasma [K+].  Given NCC is the principal transporter for Na+ reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), it plays a crucial role in controlling blood pressure, and has been shown to be regulated by the hormone aldosterone indirectly via changes in plasma [K+] (van der Lubbe et al.",b8ece74f-3e7d-4fce-80d5-03646b557efb
23,discussion5,", 2012; Terker, Yarbrough, et al., 2016). Interestingly, a recent study revealed that aldosterone rapidly activates NCC, and that this effect is lost at high [K+] in ex vivo experiments. A membrane bound G protein‐coupled receptor, GPR30, mediated the effect of aldosterone on NCC in both the in vivo and ex vivo studies, and phosphoproteomics in combination with network analysis and further in vitro work showed the activation of the EGFR tyrosine kinase pathway by aldosterone through GPR30. Thus our understanding of the signaling pathways regulating NCC are increasingly detailed . We have not investigated the aldosterone effects in our distal convoluted tubule (DCT)‐like HEK cells, but this is an important avenue for further work. Our modified HEK cell system could function as a potential model to study other aspects of NCC regulation.",97a7b00b-2b16-4ddf-86ae-069fda7e17f2
24,discussion6,"  Considerable work has gone into the elucidation of NCC phosphorylation by the WNK/SPAK pathway whereas the molecular mechanisms controlling the dephosphorylation of NCC are still poorly understood. In one of our earlier in vitro studies in Xenopus oocytes, NCC activity was found to be regulated by Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) through its interaction with a conserved N‐terminal amino acid threonine 58 of NCC, and this regulation was independent of WNK4 regulated NCC trafficking to the membrane (Glover, Mercier Zuber, Figg, & O'Shaughnessy, 2010). More recently, signaling pathways independent of the WNK4/SPAK cascade have been shown to regulate NCC phosphorylation (and therefore its activity) in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) .",bf70caae-effa-46f6-9f7f-f7588cc705aa
25,discussion7," In vitro studies showed that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) dephosphorylates NCC whereas the PP1 inhibitor calyculin A had the opposite effect, and protein kinase A (PKA)‐dependent phosphorylation of the PP1 inhibitor 1 abolished the PP1‐mediated dephosphorylation of NCC in ex vivo mouse kidney preparations . A comprehensive study of PP inhibitors in our cells has not been done to confirm if either PP1 or PP4 are important controllers of NCC dephosphorylation in our model HEK cells.  The calmodulin and calcineurin cascade has been shown to mediate NCC dephosphorylation after acute K+ loading, and this is independent of the anion . It would be of interest to investigate the potential signaling pathways regulating NCC dephosphorylation which operate at physiologically relevant [K+], and we are using a proteomics approach in order to discover them.",760aef19-0750-4e91-891c-aab214681054
26,discussion8,"  In summary, we have shown using fluorescence‐based sensors that HEK cells expressing KCNJ10, Clc‐kb, and barttin are highly sensitive to changes in [K+]o within the physiological range and also show the changes in intracellular [Cl−] that affect downstream WNK4/SPAK/NCC signaling. This confirms the hypothesized distal convoluted tubule (DCT) model in which the transcellular flux of NaCl in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) is directly regulated by the membrane potential of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) cell and its direct coupling to the phosphorylation state of NCC through the Cl− sensor WNK4.
