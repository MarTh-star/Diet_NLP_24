1,methods0," This cross-sectional study was performed among Iranian male adults working in different healthcare centers affiliated to Baqiyatallah University of Medical Science across Tehran province from September 2020 to March 2021. Using a previous study performed by Rostami et al. [15] investigating the association of adherence to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) style diet and insomnia, the minimum required sample size was calculated as 323, with alpha value and power set at 0.05 (2-sided) and 80%, respectively. However, to increase the power of our study we recruited 400 individuals. A total of 400 male adults were randomly selected by using cluster sampling method among several healthcare centers. Male adults without any history of chronic diseases (colitis, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, hepatic and renal failure, adrenal diseases, thyroid and parathyroid related disorders, anorexia nervosa or bulimia) were included.",2bc84a7f-92ca-4176-b984-64854bf9606b
2,methods1," Those participants who received anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-depressant or anti-obesity drugs, vitamins and minerals supplements (for example: vitamin D or calcium and iron supplements) within the previous 6 months were also excluded. Written informed consent were taken from all the participants before running the study. The study was ethically approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Baqiyatallah University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran (IR.BMSU.REC.1399.479).  Dietary assessment  Dietary data were collected using a semi-quantitative Willet-format food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) containing 168 food items with standard serving sizes [16]. The validity and reliability of this questionnaire in an Iranian population has been published previously [17]. Through an in person interview with expert nutritionists, participants were asked to report their consumption frequency of a given serving of each food item per day, week, month, or year.",ac9ac7a9-52df-4716-96be-f18d3395972b
3,methods2," Afterwards, the obtained values of consumption were converted to the daily grams of intake for each food item using the Iranian manual for household measures [18]. The daily nutrient and energy intake of participants were calculated by entering the daily grams of intake of each food item into the Nutritionist-IV software (First Databank; Hearst, San Bruno, CA, USA). This nutrient database is based on the USDA food composition table modified for Iranian foods.  Construction of Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet score  The collected data by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used for constructing the Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet score.",62e6689d-29a4-47a6-a607-06f312e36cc1
4,methods3," According to the method of Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, 15 dietary components consist of 10 brain-healthy food groups (green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil, and wine) and 5 unhealthy food groups ( red meats and red meat products, butter and stick margarine, cheese, pastries, fast fried foods and sweets) are included in this dietary score. In the current study, wine was not included in the Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet due to the lack of information in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s. To build the Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet score, subjects were initially classified into tertile categories based on the intakes of these food components.",893d7880-ab6d-4baa-b28f-a04dcc74e851
5,methods4," Subjects in the lowest tertile of brain-healthy food groups (green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish and poultry intake) were scored 0, those in the middle tertile were given the score of 0.5 and those in the highest tertile were given the score of 1. In case of brain-unhealthy food groups (red meats and red meat products, butter and margarine, cheese, pastries, fast fried foods and sweets), the exact opposite of this scoring protocol was applied. The scores of all 14 food components were then added up to construct an overall Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) score ranging theoretically from 0 to 14 for each subject.",15016bf3-0b35-42a6-8362-eddbcfd57414
6,methods5," The higher the Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet score of a subject, the greater his adherence to the Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) pattern.  Demographic and anthropometric assessments  A standard questionnaire was used to obtain general demographic information including age, smoking status (yes/ no), marital status (single/ married), smoking status (yes/ no), education (elementary or lower/ high school/ college and university) by a face to face interview. Physical activity was obtained using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ))-short form and expressed as metabolic equivalent (metabolic equivalent (MET))-min/day [19]. The validity and reliability of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) has been investigated in Iranian population [20].",292c9c7e-4756-4600-8966-5e4dc5ec4b78
7,methods6," Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a wall-fixed measuring tape. Body weight was measured while participants were in light clothes and without shoes. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated by dividing weight (kg) to height (m2).  Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS))  Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS)-21) was used to screen depression, anxiety and stress. Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS)-21 is a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure status of negative well beings for general population [21]. The questionnaire contains 21 items with 3 subscales. Each subscale includes 7 questions in which each item rates on a 4-point Likert scale 0–3 measuring severity of depression, anxiety and stress. Higher scores shows severe negative emotion.",bb861f1d-702f-434b-8f1b-7dbc7a05dcdb
8,methods7," The total score of each sub-class should be doubled since Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS)-21 is the short version of Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS)-42 [21]. All three main domains were devided into two categories (no anxiety (score ≤ 7) or some degree of anxiety (> 7); no depression ( score ≤ 9) or some degree of depression (> 9); no stress ( score ≤ 14) or some degree of stress (> 14). The validated Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS)-21 questionnaire in an Iranian population was used in the current study [22].  Sleep quality assessment  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) was used as a reliable and valid tool to assess sleep quality. This tool consists 19 questions with seven components scores: sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction.",51cb5655-244c-4e6c-bb28-ec015ac891bd
9,methods8," Each component score is rated from 0 to 3 (0, not in the past month; 1, less than once per week; 2, once or twice per week; and 3, three or more times per week). The total score ranges from 0 to 21, which higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality. Total scores greater than 5 indicated poor sleep quality while scores ≤ 5 were indicative of normal sleep quality. The validated version of this tool in an Iranian population done by farrahi et al. with acceptable validity and reliability was used in the current study [23].  Assessment of daytime sleepiness  The persian validated form of Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)) was used for the assessment of daytime sleepiness [24]. The questionnaire includes 8 questions investigating sleepiness in eight daily situations. Each question is rated from 0 to 3 giving a total score of 0–24. The higher scores indicating the more excessive daytime sleepiness.",9c548951-ea43-48ad-a857-7d2032981b4b
10,methods9," The severity of sleepiness was considered as normal (score ≤ 10) and mild to moderate sleepiness ( score > 10). The validity and reliability of Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire in an Iranian population has been published elsewhere [25].  Assessment of insomnia  The Insomnia Severity Index (Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)) questionnaire was used to assess sleep insomnia. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaire has seven questions with a score range of 0–4 for each item which is stratified into four categories as follows: 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe) and 4 (very Severe). The total score ranges between 0 to 28 points and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score > 7, is considered to have insomnia. The validated Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaire in an Iranian population was used in the current study [26]. ",c43161c7-766f-461b-81ca-6364b0d3652c

As stated in the methods section, our study was performed among Iranian male adults working in different healthcare centers affiliated to Baqiyatallah University of Medical Science, which is a military dependent organization in Iran. Thus, the majority of personnel were men. The association of dietary patterns and sleep quality and sleep related outcomes are of great importance in those who are working in military service or military related organizations due to the fact that they are at higher risk of sleep related disorders [27, 28]. Thus, we tried to address this associations in this group of individuals in the current study.",9b35f42d-28a3-45f6-abd6-bb97ca1e13c8
20,discussion1," Our results indicated that greater adherence to the Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) dietary pattern was associated with better sleep quality. In addition, an inverse association was found between adherence to the Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and severity of insomnia and daytime sleepiness.  Dietary modifications may have a practical role in not only improving sleep quality but also in preventing sleep disorders. The findings of a cross-sectional study on 410 female students in Iran found a significant association between short sleep duration and low quality of diet [29].",065badfd-b665-4f57-b112-4408d1edfd51
21,discussion2," Another study on 896 American women revealed no significant relationship between short sleep duration and diet quality, while significant associations were observed between long sleep duration and lower diet quality, specially lower fruit intakes and higher consumption of empty calories [30].  As reported in our results, higher intake of vegetables, beans, berries and whole grains were observed in subjects with higher adherence to the Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and higher adherence to the Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet was associated with better sleep quality and less sleep disorders including insomnia and daytime sleepiness.",da74794c-2ce9-4e5a-9df6-c54396e3cb4a
22,discussion3," In line with our findings, results of previous studies have investigated that higher intake of specific dietary components (fibers, minerals and vitamins) are associated with better sleep duration and quality and less sleep disorders [31, 32]. The results of a cross-sectional study on 1936 Italian individuals revealed that adherence to a low inflammatory index diet (such as dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) or Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet) was associated with improved sleep quality [33]. Pahlavani et al. investigated the correlation between adherence to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern and daytime sleepiness score in 535 adolescent girls in Iran; the results of the their study shed light on the inverse association between adherence to dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and daytime sleepiness score [13].",04569cd0-e86d-4fe1-90b5-7066cc030bff
23,discussion4," Another similar study on 488 adolescent girls in Iran revealed that high adherence to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH)-style diet was associated with a lower odds of insomnia in comparison to subjects with the lowest adherence [15].  Evidence has indicated that quality of sleep, sleep duration and sleep disturbance are associated with systemic inflammation [34]. The mechanisms that might explain the associations between sleep disturbance and inflammation are not fully explored. Sleep affects two primary effector systems, the sympathetic nervous system (sympathetic nervous system (SNS)) and the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA)) axis, which both together shift the basal gene expression profile toward increased pro-inflammatory profile [35, 36]. Activation of β-adrenergic signaling stimulates NF-κB pathway, inflammatory gene expression, release of proinflammatory cytokines, and markers of systemic inflammation [35].",49e1a78a-2303-482e-b738-0e76a90d0a10
24,discussion5," Since normal nocturnal sleep is associated with a reduction in sympathetic outflow [37], the sympathetic effector pathway activation might be considered as one of the potential mechanisms to explain the associations between sleep disturbance, short sleep duration, and increased systemtic inflammation. On the other hand, Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) dietary pattern as a hybrid of Mediterranean and dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary patterns contains a variety of anti-inflmmatory components including: omega-3 fatty acids in fish and walnuts, folate in grean leafy vegetables, vitamin E in nuts and olive oil, and flavonoids in berries which may exert greater anti-inflammatory effects with regard to the mentioned dietary patterns independently.",e4283425-b401-4099-8e34-f2f23621c52a
25,discussion6," Therefore, the anti-inflammatory effects of Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) dietary pattern may justify the favorable effects on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness and insomnia. In addition, evidence has indicated that sleep disturbance may accumulate free radicals in the cerebral tissues which subsequently leads to cerebral oxidative stress [38]. It has also proven that Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) dietary pattern has antioxidant effects which support its preventive effects on cognitive impairment and sleep disorders [39]. Given the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of psychological and sleep-related disorders [40, 41], the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet might protect brain health.",c54d880b-1e42-472d-9dc7-6b635baec072

It is also among the first studies which have investigated the association between Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) dietary pattern and depression, anxiety and stress. The statistical analysis were controlled for several potential confounders. In addition, dietary intakes were obtained using a validated and reliable food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). On the other hand, the current study has some limitations that should be considered while interpreting the findings. The current study can not prove the causality and the temporality of relations due to the nature of study design (cross-sectional study).",9de73f1b-e12d-4c09-8a40-343f20925e56

Moreover, study outcomes were assessed using self-reported questionnaires and are susceptible to recall bias and misreporting.  In conclusion, no significant associations were found between adherence to the Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and odds of stress, anxiety and depression in this cross-sectional study on male adults. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that greater adherence to the Mediterranean dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet were associated with lower odds of poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness and insomnia.
