0,introduction0,"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific complication that occurs after 20 weeks of gestation and is characterised by hypertension, proteinuria and oedema, with or without multiple organ damage1. It is a major cause of foetal and maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide, and affects 2–8% of all pregnancies2. Currently, the only definitive treatment for preeclampsia is to terminate the pregnancy3. Therefore, primary prevention of preeclampsia is vital.  Evidence indicates that maternal diet is an important potential factor affecting the incidence of preeclampsia4,5. Studies have shown that diets rich in vegetables and fruits or various nutrients such as vitamin D, calcium and zinc are associated with lower levels of oxidative stress and inflammation6,7, which are both recognised pathogenic factors for preeclampsia8.",18404fe9-d32a-49c9-b2e2-73f3fc6acf90
1,introduction1," However, individual foods or nutrients are consumed in various characteristic combinations, so nutritional epidemiologists have recommended using overall dietary patterns to find links between diet and diseases9. Recent studies have used factor analysis to explore the relationship between dietary patterns and the risk of preeclampsia10–12. However, the dietary patterns obtained in these studies were only appropriate for local residents and the results were not comparable. Universal dietary recommendations for the prevention of preeclampsia remain limited.  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) diet is an established dietary pattern rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy and plant proteins from nuts and legumes, but low in red/processed meat, sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages13.",e1b231f9-d3c3-4bbd-91a1-0df83e2e6375
2,introduction2," The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was originally designed and evaluated for lowering blood pressure14, but recent studies have shown its benefits for glioma15, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease16 and other metabolic disorders such as cardiovascular disease17, type 2 diabetes18 and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)19. However, so far, no study has assessed the association between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the odds of preeclampsia.  Although preeclampsia is also characterised by hypertension, its mechanism is not quite the same as that of adult hypertension. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the association between adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet and the odds of preeclampsia among pregnant women in China.",284004bd-278e-4d1e-bb9c-98a6df0b31cb

4,methods0,"Participants This hospital-based case-control study was conducted between March 2016 and June 2019 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (located in Zhengzhou, a medium-sized city in central China that has been well developed in recent years). Pregnant women of reproductive age (≥18 years) after the 28th week of pregnancy and with single pregnancy were included. The preeclampsia cases were pregnant women who had been diagnosed with preeclampsia by a physician, according to China’s ‘Diagnosis and treatment guideline of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy’ (2015). In this guideline, preeclampsia is defined as systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) ≥ 90 mmHg after 20 weeks of gestation and accompanied by any of the following characteristics: (1) urinary protein ≥ 0.3 g/24 h, or urinary protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 0.",19d3ae0f-7fdd-4c04-abc0-98a5ab6e8ff3

The exclusion criteria for subjects in both groups were as follows: (1) patients with heart disease, malignancy, hyperthyroidism, immune system diseases, chronic renal insufficiency, and other endocrine system diseases; and (2) patients with epilepsy, depression and other mental or cognitive dysfunction.",ed1c472b-3a2e-434c-b47f-317c8e78850c
6,methods2,"  Calculation of sample size On the basis of earlier evidence, we assumed that approximately 30% of the people in the control group would have higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores, and the estimated OR between the higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and preeclampsia odds was 0.6012. With 90% power (β = 0.10), type I error of 0.05 (α = 0.05) and desired CI of 0.95, the minimum required sample size in each group was calculated to be 394, that is, a total of 788 participants. Finally, 449 cases and 449 controls were enrolled in this study.  Assessment of dietary intake The dietary intake of the study participants during the last three months before delivery was assessed through a valid and reliable semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ))24, which included 78 items of foods commonly consumed by Chinese.",87e854e2-9255-44e0-a09a-292180bd6442
7,methods3," For each food item, 4 possible frequencies (never, every month, every week and every day) and the amount of consumption each time in grams or millilitres were available. The daily intakes of energy (kcal/d) and key nutrients from each food were calculated according to the Chinese Food Composition Tables25.  Assessment of adherence to a dietary approaches to stop hypertension-style diet A Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was calculated based on the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for each participant. According to Fung’s method26, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was constructed based on the foods and nutrients emphasised or minimised in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, focusing on eight components: high intake of whole grains; fruits; vegetables; nuts and legumes; and low-fat dairy products, and low intake of red/processed meats; sweetened beverages; and sodium26.",8f14390f-8489-48cb-9293-65927e83cdf2
8,methods4," Because we could not assess the dietary intake of whole grains and low-fat dairy products accurately, we instead calculated whole grains and mixed beans, and dairy products, respectively. Considering that pregnant women consume few sugary drinks, we added sweets to this component.  The scoring criteria and food composition of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet in our study are shown in Table 5. First, the energy-adjusted amounts of components of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet were obtained through the residual method27. Subsequently, quintile cut-off points for each component of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet were obtained in all participants. For the five groups of whole grains and mixed beans, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, and dairy products, those in the highest quintile were given 5 points and those in the lowest quintile received 1 point.",cf237cd6-fd59-48f9-afc1-eb6479a7a95a
9,methods5," In contrast, for the remaining three components, the lowest quintile was given 5 points and the highest received 1 point. An overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score ranging from 8 to 40 was obtained by summing the eight component scores. Individuals with higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were more likely to follow the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.Table 5 Scoring criteria and food composition for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet in this case-control studya.",27ca9285-b5fc-4f17-887d-b055f7d3e291

At least two measurements were averaged for further analysis. The participants’ physical activity during pregnancy included daily occupational, leisure-time and household-chores, and was expressed as metabolic equivalents (metabolic equivalents (MET)) hour/day28.

The association of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet with preeclampsia was assessed using binary logistic regression. In addition to the original model, three different models were developed: Model 1 was adjusted for age, gestational age and GDM (yes/no).

25,discussion0,"This case-control study demonstrated an inverse association between adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet and the odds of preeclampsia. This significant inverse relationship remained in the model adjusted for multiple confounders, especially for major risk factors of preeclampsia including pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and nulliparity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case-control study to explore the association between adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet and the odds of preeclampsia in a Chinese population.  Recent studies have assessed the effects of maternal dietary patterns on the risk of preeclampsia10,12,20. In a prospective longitudinal cohort study in Norway21, four dietary patterns were obtained by factor analysis, of which two were associated with preeclampsia.",7e14426e-178d-428c-af83-5f8618b8f21d
26,discussion1," The dietary pattern characterised by high consumption of vegetables, plant foods and vegetable oils was inversely associated with the odds of developing preeclampsia, while another pattern characterised by processed meat, salty snacks and sweet drinks had the opposite effect10. The above results were consistent with our study in terms of the positive scoring and reverse scoring components of a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet.  Furthermore, several previous studies have shown that the components of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet have different effects on preeclampsia11,21–23. A meta-analysis reported that a healthy dietary pattern, rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains, was significantly associated with lower odds of preeclampsia11. These components  had a large overlap with the characteristics of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.",d24711e4-a7c4-4a2b-9e4c-e87f876f657f
27,discussion2," Whole grains, as an important positive scoring component of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, have been linked to reduced preeclampsia and its risk factors in previous studies, attributed to their nutrients and fibre composition. An observational study of 1538 women in the US found that higher total fibre intake reduced the preeclampsia risk, possibly by attenuating pregnancy-associated dyslipidaemia22. In addition, a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet is high in vegetables and fruits, which are rich in natural antioxidants that have been linked to the recognised pathogenic factor of oxidative stress in preeclampsia21. A prospective cohort study in Norway suggested that foods with a high content of added sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages were significantly associated with increased risk of preeclampsia, while foods with natural sugars, such as fresh and dried fruits, were associated with decreased risk of preeclampsia23.",b2c3f919-97e5-44ac-98ef-23ae7fce9671
28,discussion3," A possible explanation is that added sugar provides excess energy intake while foods with a high content of natural sugars are rich in dietary fibre. Red or processed meat and sodium are reverse scoring components of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. However, the relationship between these components and preeclampsia and its mechanism has not been reported. More research is needed in the future to uncover the specific mechanism of each component of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the synergistic effects among them.  The Chinese diet is characterised by high consumption of plant foods (grains, vegetables, etc.), lack of high-quality proteins (lean meat, fish, dairy products, etc.) and high oil and salt. The characteristics of high sodium, low calcium and low high-quality protein are the opposite of what the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet recommends and may be important factors in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.",69bc3a49-7b7d-41bb-8670-d89ff4fa3834
29,discussion4," Therefore, for Chinese pregnant women, greater adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet may be associated with decreased odds of preeclampsia. Further studies are also needed in other countries where the diets and foods are naturally different.  This study has many advantages. First, it is the first study to assess the association between adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet and the odds of preeclampsia. Second, our study used a matched case-control design to control for the three major confounders, age, gestational age and GDM. In addition, the relatively large sample size of participants improved the validity, and the sensitivity analysis improved the reliability of the results.  However, some limitations must also be considered when interpreting our findings.",2edf7c85-6e34-4069-9a37-890ba81769db
30,discussion5," First, although we used a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to measure dietary intake, there were still inevitable measurement errors and recall bias. Nonetheless, the measurement accuracy benefitted from the employment of trained interviewers who used photographs of food portion sizes to administer the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) through face-to-face interviews. Second, considering that patients with preeclampsia have a relatively short time from onset to delivery, we only collected information on the dietary intake of the pregnant women during the final three months before delivery to reduce the recall bias of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), which may have led to a failure to account for the potential influence of early pregnancy diet on preeclampsia.  In conclusion, our findings suggest an inverse relationship between adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet and the odds of preeclampsia.",fe6535d8-a01b-4ba0-8aad-999140ee7064
