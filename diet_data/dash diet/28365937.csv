0,methods0,"2.1. Eligibility Criteria Longitudinal and cohort studies containing information on diet and PA either prior to or at the commencement of a singleton human pregnancy were included. Although gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was the main outcome measure, studies that reported other outcomes (e.g., pre-eclampsia, macrosomia and large/small for gestational age offspring) were also included. Studies were excluded if they were published in a language other than English, subjects had diabetes mellitus in pregnancy diagnosed at the start of the pregnancy, or an underlying medical condition that affected digestion and absorption of nutrients (e.g., sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass surgery).  2.2. Information Sources and Search This systematic review was registered at PROSPERO (www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO) as CRD42016027795. A systematic literature search was undertaken initially 22 October 2015 and was later updated 2 February 2017 by three independent researchers (J.M-V., L.C. and S.C.).",9ddcccd6-c68c-44e1-bab1-ff55eb46c532
1,methods1," The search was conducted using Medline, PubMed, Science Direct, EMBASE and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)) databases with interest in studies that reported on the relationship between diet and/or PA during pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Additionally, we hand searched reference lists to obtain more studies. For a complete list of search terms, please refer to Table S1. A time frame 1985–2017 was selected as it reflected the current context of high prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) as well as to capture good quality cohort and longitudinal studies.  2.3. Quality Assessment and Data Extraction To determine study quality, studies were assessed independently (J.M-V., L.C., S.C.",ff6a4a5d-7fcc-4507-9c4e-ab899f89341a
2,methods2,") using a modified version of the Quality Criteria Checklist found in the American Dietetic Association (American Dietetic Association (ADA)) Evidence Manual [19]. Information about confounding variables and adjusted data was also collected from included studies to highlight study strengths or weaknesses. We assigned either a positive, neutral or a negative value for studies that were of excellent, good and poor quality respectively. Study characteristics were extracted into a pre-determined table that collected information including author, year of publication, participant number, study selection criteria, data collection methods, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnostic criteria as well as results and how they were deduced. Data were cross-checked by co-author (VF) for any errors and discrepancies.  2.4. Statistical Analysis Our primary outcome measure was onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).",6de6b144-5df6-407b-a1c4-116071a29ff6
3,methods3," We quantified study results using odds ratios (OR), which along with their sample variances, were calculated using the escalc function in metafor R package (Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands) [20]. A positive effect size suggests that the odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are higher in group A (active) than B (inactive). Where results were reported as stratified across groups a combined effect-size was calculated following Borenstein and colleagues [21]. Where results were reported in text as relative risk (RR), we used the following equation (Equation 1) from Deeks and Altman [22] to convert values reported to OR, where pc is the typical event rate without treatment: (1) OR =RR (1 −pc)1 −pcRR   For analysis, odds ratios were log transformed (i.e., lnOR), and in places we back-transform overall lnOR for interpretation by raising e (exponential) to the power of the lnOR.",21181c46-5c7c-471c-b41b-dc95e89e5f43
4,methods4,"  We analyzed effect sizes using a random-effects meta-analysis (random effects meta analysis (REMA)) model, implemented in the R package metafor. Statistical heterogeneity was quantified via the heterogeneity statistic, I2—a type of intra-class correlation [23]. I2 corresponds to the percentage of among effect sizes variance, that cannot be attributed to sampling. An I2 value determined variability of results between different studies as either low (25%), moderate (50%) or high (75%). We were unable to perform a meta-analysis on dietary studies as they were too diverse in the aspects of the diet they report on. Therefore, we report on meta-analyses conducted on PA studies only.  We assessed the risk of publication bias across studies by developing a funnel plot with lnOR scale and inverse standard error as x and y-axis respectively. We also used a regtest function in metafor to determine funnel plot asymmetry.",6a1016a1-ae23-4034-9dcf-9c1018cc36a9
5,methods5," It should be noted that tests of funnel plot asymmetry can be unreliable indicators of publication bias where the number of effect sizes is small (<10) and/or there is substantial heterogeneity. Thus, in the main text, we only present and interpret results from publication bias tests where the number of effect sizes was greater than 10. Statistical significance of the overall effect of PA was inferred when the p-value was <0.05 and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) did not contain 0.  3. Results 3.1. Studies Identified We extracted 1166 articles from the database searches, and one article was identified through hand-search. After screening and assessing for eligibility, we identified 40 journal articles which met inclusion criteria (Figure 1). Of these 40 articles, 23 reported data only on dietary intake, 15 only on PA and two articles reported on both dietary intake and PA. Twenty-nine studies (72%) obtained a positive quality rating and 11 (28%) were rated neutral (Table S2).",d1661fc2-f938-44f5-bd4d-3a8dcb3677d9
6,methods6," All the articles reported findings from prospective cohort studies of which there were multiple publications from four major studies including Nurses’ Health Study II (n = 14) [24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37], Omega (n = 7) [38,39,40,41,42,43,44], Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (n = 4) [45,46,47,48] and Project Viva (n = 2) [49,50]. The most common reasons for exclusion of publications were unavailability of full texts, no relevant data collected necessary for the present review and late recruitment of study participants, consequently capturing dietary and PA information that were not reflective of the pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy period.  3.2. General Characteristics of Studies The review captured data on 30,871 pregnancies of which 1980 (7%) developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).",03b46530-f29c-42be-8371-a75f1a67c3f3
7,methods10," Twenty-two publications reported data from the pre-pregnancy period [24,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,41,42,45,46,47,51,62], ten focused on early pregnancy [39,48,50,52,54,57,58,60,63], seven on both [40,43,49,55,56,59,61] and one was unclear [44]. Refer to Table S3 for more information about study characteristics.  3.3. Diet Related Studies To account for the diversity of 25 dietary studies identified after inclusion, we categorised them into one of seven themes: carbohydrates, fat intake, protein, fast food intake, caffeine, calcium intake and commonly recognised dietary patterns. The predominating dietary collection method was a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) (n = 23) [24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,33,34,35,41,42,43,45,46,47,57,62,63]. The remaining two studies used a rapid food screener [51] and an interview [58] to collect dietary data. Studies focusing on early pregnancy collected dietary data <22 weeks into pregnancy.",3c59c2cf-0313-48d2-9ed1-3b7727e70695
8,methods11," When studies reporting on diet and PA were compared with respect to adjusted confounding variables (Figure 2), we observed that age, body mass index (BMI) and parity were most common in both. Only 70% of diet related and 10% PA studies adjusted for energy intake.  3.3.1. Carbohydrates (Fruit, Fiber, Beverages, Potato) Five studies reported on high carbohydrate foods, including fruit, fiber, potato and beverage intake and their respective associations to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk [26,27,30,31,34]. High pre-pregnancy fruit intake was not associated with an increase in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk (RR high vs. low intake = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.76–1.16) [31], however fruit fiber [34] was reported to be protective (RR fruit fiber = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51–0.86). Although high compared to low apple intake suggested non-significant protection from gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk (RR apple = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.65–1.",3ccd280f-fd6a-462f-93f2-37c70b804451
9,methods12,"01), the overall trend across quintiles of apple consumption reached statistical significance (p-trend < 0.05) [31]. Protective effects were also evident when consumption of total dietary fiber and cereal fiber were examined (RR total fiber = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.51–0.90; RR cereal fiber = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59–0.99) [34].  Higher frequency of potato intake increased the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (RR high vs. low frequency intake = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.24–2.13) [27]. However, frequent consumers of potato tended to be current smokers, had higher body mass index (BMI) and lower diet quality as assessed by the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (Alternate Healthy Eating Index diet (AHEI)) 2010 score [27]. In contrast, a study by Karamanos and colleagues found that women who went on to develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) consumed less potatoes and cereals than those that did not develop it [63].",5934a0bb-997d-4064-b08f-2f1593dda7d7
10,methods13," Replacing two servings of potatoes per week for other vegetables types, legumes or wholegrain foods resulted in a 9%, 10% and 17% gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk reduction respectively [27]. No significant association was observed between potato crisps or corn chips and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk after adjustment of confounding variables including age, parity, race, family history of diabetes, smoking, PA, energy intake, diet quality and body mass index (BMI) [27].  The relationship between 100% fruit juice consumption and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) onset was nonlinear, with the lowest risk observed in women with moderate fruit juice intake [31]. In contrast, higher sugar sweetened beverage (sugar sweetened beverage (SSB)) intake was associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk (RR ≥ 5 week = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.05–1.45, p-value = 0.005) [30].",5136eb22-6294-4932-9a29-7feeaa606ae1
11,methods14," When different sub-types of sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) were taken into account, the strongest association was observed for sugar sweetened cola (RR high vs. low intake = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.07–1.55) but not for non-cola sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) (RR high vs. low = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.78–1.25) [30].  3.3.2. Fat Intake (i.e., Total, Monounsaturated Fatty Acids, Dietary Cholesterol, Egg Intake) Higher intake of animal, cholesterol and monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) were significantly associated with increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [29]. When comparing highest to lowest quintile of animal fat intake (% E), the risk increased by ~90% (RR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.36–2.60) [29]. Similarly, a comparison between the highest and lowest quintile of cholesterol intake elucidated a positive relationship with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk (RR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.35, 4.09).",c9c0bbdb-9d6a-4200-9647-2c39f34b56b2
12,methods15," On the contrary, Baptise-Roberts and colleagues reported no association between either cholesterol or total fat intake with a high glucose response following a glucose challenge test [51].  While no associations were observed between total omega-3 or total omega-6 fatty acids and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in one study [29], another noted that women who developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) had a lower n-6/n-3 ratio, a higher intake of n-3 fatty acid and polyunsaturated fats than their non-gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) counterparts [50]. Each 300 mg/day intake of alpha-linolenic acid, was associated with an increased risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), with an OR = 1.29 (95% CI: 1.04–1.60) [50]. Karamanos and colleagues reported that olive oil was consumed in higher quantities in women who went on to develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared to those that did not [63], however no association analysis was presented [63].",88db0e0b-83c4-432f-b0b2-1c06c96546a6
13,methods16," With regards to egg consumption, one study suggested that high intakes increased the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by a 1.77-fold [42], while another found no such association [24].  3.4.3. Protein Intake (i.e., Meat, Iron, Heme) Bao and colleagues reported that an intake of protein from animal origin increased the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by ~50%, whereas an intake of protein sourced from vegetables was protective by 30% [24]. Similarly, a low carbohydrate dietary pattern with high animal protein and animal content was associated with a 36% increase risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), whereas a low carbohydrate diet containing high intake of plant-sourced protein and fat was not associated with any increased risk [25]. Replacing 5% energy of animal protein for protein of plant origin reduced gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk by 51% [24].",c2f21932-76b5-4a16-b398-ee173612a922
14,methods17,"  Neither a high meat score before pregnancy calculated using The Rapid Food Screener [51] or a high red meat intake in early pregnancy [50] were able to predict gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk in the two studies. On the contrary, three studies concluded that women with a high pre-pregnancy red meat intake had between 1.4–2.0 times the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [24,35,47]. There are similar inconsistent findings for processed meat intake and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk. Two studies reported a statistically significant increased risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), ranging between 48–68% during the pre-pregnancy period [24,35], whereas the remaining study found no such association [50]. A positive relationship was observed between higher pre-pregnancy iron or heme intake and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [28,43].",889a8654-46eb-4a23-bdac-e7598c75d76e
15,methods18," While Behboudi-Gandevani and colleagues [57] observed no statistically significant differences in iron or zinc intake in women with or without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) did have a statistically significant higher serum iron level in early pregnancy.  3.3.4. Caffeine Two studies [38,58] reported on caffeine intake and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Whilst both captured caffeine intake during the pre-pregnancy period, Hinckle and colleagues additionally looked at tea intake [58]. Coffee consumption was reported to have a protective affect against gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in one study [RR = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.28–0.82)] [38], but failed to reach a statistical significance in the other (RR ≥ 8 vs. 0 cups/day = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.64–1.25) [58]. Consumption of decaffeinated coffee was not associated with risk reduction [38].",175a290f-2de3-4e98-9cd4-a7004b587a96
16,methods19," Increasing frequency of tea intake indicated a potential protective effect against gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk, albeit statistically insignificant (RR ≥ 8 vs. 0 cups/day = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.55–1.0) [58].  3.3.5. Fast Food Intake Increasing frequency of fast food intake prior to pregnancy was associated with a statistically significant increased risk [26] or incidence [62] of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The reported RR for ≥7/week vs. <1/week = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.53–3.09) [26] and Odds Ratio (OR) for highest vs. lowest frequency intake = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.13–3.06) [62]. Women with greater fast food consumption were typically younger, current smokers, multiparous, less physically active and followed diets that were either less adherent to the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) pattern [62] or had an overall lower Alternate Healthy Eating Index diet (AHEI)-2010 diet quality score [26].  3.3.6.",277e74f2-36c3-4f77-9e7e-1ea3786ed873
17,methods20," Calcium/Dairy Intake Total pre-pregnancy dairy intake was not associated with risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [24,41]. Habitual maternal intake of low-fat dairy suggested a non-significant inverse association with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk (RR highest vs. lowest quintile = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.32–1.02) [41], however the overall trend across quartiles of low-fat dairy intake reached statistical significance (p-trend < 0.05). Interestingly, Schoenacker and colleagues (2015) observed fruit and low-fat dairy as a dietary pattern, but found no association with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk [47]. With respect to calcium intake, an inverse association with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk was observed, albeit statistically insignificant [41]. When quintiles were grouped into higher vs.",de556a03-51c1-4cf6-b8d1-7ab4fb775190
18,methods21," lower level of intake, women who consumed ≥795 mg Calcium/day had a 42% gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk reduction when compared to those who had <795 mg/day [41].  3.3.7. Recognised Dietary Patterns MedDiet was the most consistently reported protective dietary pattern against gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk, reaching statistical significant in all four studies [33,46,47,63]. In a comprehensive review by Radd-Vagenas and colleagues, MedDiet is defined as a diet containing higher bread, cereal, legume, vegetable, fruit, fish and olive oil intake and smaller or limited intake of animal fat, meat and eggs [65]. The extent of MedDiet protectiveness ranged from 15–38%.",59cc8ebe-a16b-43d3-863c-f7ce97661c8f
19,methods22," Although women with better MedDiet compliance had lower incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) than their non-compliant counterparts, Karamanos and colleagues reported that gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) incidence greatly differed when comparing American Dietetic Association (ADA) and International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) diagnostic criteria between the compliant groups (8% vs. 24%, respectively) [63].  Adherence to a diet with a high Alternate Healthy Eating Index diet (AHEI) 2010 score was associated with a reduced risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by 19% [37] or 46% [33]. When additional lifestyle factors were taken into account such as regular PA, normal body mass index (BMI), non-smoker, the association with risk reduction was 83% [37].",885a0e3a-766b-49d3-b305-6881cab84b30
20,methods23," Similarly to the Alternate Healthy Eating Index diet (AHEI) scoring system, some studies used an Australian Recommended Food Score (Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS)) [45] or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) score [33]. A high Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS) was not associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk [45], whereas a greater Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet compliance was associated with a 34% gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk reduction [33]. With respect to Prudent and Western diets, there were some conflicting results. Whilst compliance to a Prudent or Western diet resulted in a negative and positive association with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk respectively in one study [35], a second study observed no such relationships [50].  3.4.",6c861732-9a21-4a17-b83e-c2a845a4257d
21,methods24," Physical Activity The relationship between PA and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was examined by 17 publications, including the Nurse’s Health Study II (NHS II, n = 3), OMEGA Study (n = 3), Projecta VIVA (n = 1), the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (n = 1). Data collection methods included interviews (n = 2), questionnaires (n = 14, of which 12 were validated) and a self-report (n = 1, also validated). PA levels were captured during the pre-pregnancy (n = 10) and early pregnancy (n = 9) stages.  Overall, PA was reported to be protective against gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in 13 of 17 studies and the degree of protection generally increased with greater levels of PA. Eleven studies reported that PA before pregnancy was beneficially associated with reduced risk by 22–86% [36,37,39,40,44,49,51,56,61], with only two studies not reaching statistical significance [32,59]. The degree of potential protection depended on type and duration of PA.",b2b77bee-2b40-4527-b0e5-70e2759ea2cf
22,methods25," Similarly, ten studies that assessed early pregnancy PA levels also reported a reduction in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk with higher PA, ranging between 11–52%, however two studies not reaching statistical significance [40,48]. When both pre-pregnancy and early pregnancy PA levels were taken into account, there was an even lower risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) observed (RR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.12–0.79) [40].  The most apparent associations between PA and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk were observed in 13 studies reporting on Leisure Time PA (Leisure Time PA (LTPA)). Of these, ten reported a significant reduction in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk [36,37,39,40,44,49,51,55,60,61]. Two studies that examined Leisure Time PA (LTPA) volumes, suggested ≥150 min/week [61] or ≥210 min/week [37] as being sufficient to reduce the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).",613031a9-c6ca-47fb-aa84-5cd247ab9698
23,methods26," Higher leisure activity score [51] before pregnancy was associated with a 68% reduced risk of a high 1 h glucose challenge test. In terms of intensity-weighted PA volume (Metabolic Equivalent (MET) hours/week), the beneficial association of PA in the year before pregnancy were observed at ≥15 [44] or ≥21 MET hours/week [40]. Solomon et al. [32] and Van der Ploeg et al. [48] suggested a lower gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk with higher frequency and volume of vigorous PA, but this association did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, one study [52] reported that Leisure Time PA (LTPA) was associated with reduced rates of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) only among women in the obese pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) category. Engaging in Leisure Time PA (LTPA) [39] before and during pregnancy was associated with a 46% gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk reduction.",c9dadd95-7845-40a0-80e3-53021f291b45
24,methods27,"  The three studies that reported on total PA levels suggested that higher total PA volume [56,61] or score [59] was associated with lower risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [56,59,61], although one did not reach significance [59] and another was borderline statistically significant [56]. Two studies suggested that higher domestic (e.g., child and elderly caregiving, meal preparation, cleaning, shopping, gardening) PA levels were associated with lower risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [56,59], although one did not reach statistical significance [59]. Putman and colleagues observed that gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk was highest among women with the least average daily energy expenditure (≤2200 kcal) [53].  Meta-Analysis and Assessment of Bias Of 17 PA studies, 16 were suitable for meta-analyses [32,36,37,39,40,44,48,49,51,52,53,55,56,59,60,61] as they reported associations with sufficient statistical evidence.",46e50d50-cbbd-4f16-a916-9dc0e50d75a7
25,methods28," We were able to test a priori different indicators of PA and results were consistent. Engaging in any type of PA compared to none during the prepregnancy period was associated with approximately 30% reduced odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.57–0.85; I2 = 52% (medium), p-value = 0.0006), whereas engaging in any PA early in pregnancy suggested reduced odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by 21% (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.64–0.97, I2 = 26% (low), p-value = 0.03) as evident in Figure 3. Taking part in any Leisure Time PA (LTPA) compared to none either before (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.43–1.00; I2 = 90% (high), p-value = 0.05) or during early pregnancy (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.50–0.96; I2 = 15% (low), p-value = 0.03) suggested a beneficial association with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (Figure 4), with the prior not achieving statistical level of significance.

Taking part in approximately >90 min/week in Leisure Time PA (LTPA) before pregnancy was associated with 46% reduced odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.34–0.87; I2 = 70% (medium), p-value = 0.01) (Figure 6). It was not possible to perform a meta-analysis for the early pregnancy period for any Leisure Time PA (LTPA) indicator due to insufficient number of studies. For natural log OR values before back-transformation, refer to Table S4.  Tests revealed a variable degree of heterogeneity ranging from 15–95%. Based on an almost symmetrical distribution of data points in funnel plots Figure 7A (n studies = 10, z = −1.52, p = 0.13) and Figure 7B (n studies = 10, z = −0.65, p = 0.52), there was no evidence of publication bias.",b28c75d2-e1aa-4628-8390-1399a859afd1
27,methods30," Remaining funnel plots are presented in supplementary materials section as they contained <10 studies in their analyses. This includes Figure S1a (n studies = 9, z = −1.90, p = 0.06) with some symmetry present and Figure S1b (n studies = 6, z = −2.96, p = 0.003) and Figure S1c (n studies = 4, z = −2.34, p = 0.02) suggesting presence of asymmetry and potentially publication bias.  4. Discussion The present systematic review identified 40 studies reporting on the relationship between diet or physical activity (PA) and subsequent risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). It is the first review to examine a range of specific dietary factors and indicators of PA, with a view to shedding light on the relative importance of these crucial lifestyle health behavior factors.",96ffef40-35f0-4a83-98d4-06e14d976c87
28,methods31," We identified more observational studies than previous reviews [66,67], including those that additionally reported on PA levels, thereby providing a more comprehensive overview of lifestyle factors involved in the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). In addition, we visually depicted different types of confounding variables that were adjusted for in each individual study (Figure 2). While age, body mass index (BMI) and parity topped the list, we discovered that only one-in-three dietary studies adjusted for energy intake. This raises concerns about interpretation of data as many nutrients are associated with energy intake [68].  4.1. Diet and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) Risk Our present study investigated consumption of different types of beverages including fruit juice, sugar sweetened beverage (SSB), coffee and tea intake in relation to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk.",8a89e5f7-6c84-4761-b74c-34dfc7662166
29,methods32," While coffee consumption appeared to be protective against gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in one study, sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption resulted in a statistically significant positive association. There are now concerns over excessive sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, particularly due to the reported association with obesity and risk of chronic diseases [69]. At the population level, there has been a decline in the overall sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) intake in several countries [69,70,71] over the same time frame, but there may be segments of the population such as young adults who continue to consume sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) in high amounts [72]. Added sugars from sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) are likely to be part of a poorer quality diet and lifestyle [73].",fd59558c-ae32-4474-b6bc-0171f705010e
30,methods33," In one study [30], women with higher intake of sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) tended to have a diet lower in total dietary fiber, fruits and vegetables prompting the need to focus on a dietary pattern and quality in understanding any associations with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk.  In particular, several studies from our literature search indicate that a MedDiet may be protective and possibly reduce the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by 15–38%. The protective association may extend to reducing future risk of type 2 diabetes (by 19–23%), increasing chance of remission (by 49%) [74] and protection against cardiovascular diseases with extra virgin olive oil and plant-based dietary components in the diet [65]. There are however, drawbacks in defining what specifically constitutes a ‘traditional’ MedDiet due to variability among different regions of the Mediterranean.",9b859fd6-c6af-4a29-bbd9-66029d964dc3
31,methods34," At present, a ‘traditional’ MedDiet is characterized by larger quantities of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, unprocessed cereals and grains, extra virgin olive oil, moderate fish and wine and small amount of meat intake with low amounts of discretionary foods [65]. High red or processed meat consumption before pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). In fact, two meta-analyses conducted in a healthy adult population found that processed meat intake was associated with a greater risk of coronary heart disease (42%) and type 2 diabetes (19–32%) [75,76]. The proposed mechanism of coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes onset include excess sodium and oxidative stress due to high levels of iron and advanced glycation end products [76] but warrants further discussion.",870ca57a-ca28-49f6-99b9-c47ad0ea8da9
32,methods35," Given the traditional MedDiet is low in meat consumption, this could be one of the reasons why the diet persistently provides health benefits across different age groups and stages of life.  The risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in an Australian population following a MedDiet was partly (32%) mediated by pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) [46]. While it cannot be denied that MedDiet provides multiple health benefits, the extent to which body mass index (BMI) explains the association with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) comes as no surprise as obesity promotes insulin resistance [77]. In fact, a study by Janssen et al. [78] reported significant changes in insulin and leptin levels in the first trimester of women with a high body mass index (BMI) that was comparable to that of women with a normal body mass index (BMI) in the third trimester. This has enormous implications not only for maternal metabolism but also for fetal growth trajectory [78].  4.2.",2481ce80-b5d8-4149-9d38-1ba707a22fd4
33,methods36," Physical Activity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) The present meta-analysis suggested a protective association of PA (21–46%) from gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) when comparing any type of PA to none in either the pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy period. In a pooled data set from 6 studies, consisting of 661,137 men and women, Arem and colleagues [79] reported a similar protective association for all-cause mortality, which was steepest for comparisons between none (referent) and the equivalent of 150 min/week moderate-intensity Leisure Time PA (LTPA) (or 7.5 MET.hr/week). While current PA guidelines for pregnancy recommend 150 min/week [16,80] of moderate or 75 min/week vigorous intensity PA [81], the majority of adults still fail to meet the PA guidelines [82]  Our meta-analysis, however, suggests a potentially lower odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (46%) at >90 min/week.",95fe493e-df67-4255-9123-06f79bff3311
34,methods37," Similarly, O’Donovan and colleagues reported that taking part in 1 or 2 sessions/week in moderate-vigorous intensity PA resulted in CVD and all-cause mortality risk reduction regardless of an individual’s adherence to the current guidelines [83]. Whilst the potential benefits of structured Leisure Time PA (LTPA) are undisputed, volumes of PA below the recommended levels and even light intensity PA may have measurable health benefits [84].  We also observed that women who engaged in any type of PA compared to none in the year before pregnancy had potentially 10% lower odds of developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) than women who engaged in PA also compared to none during early pregnancy. The findings are further strengthened by presence of low-medium level of heterogeneity, no evidence of publication bias and data collected by predominantly validated questionnaires.",1ac8c773-5194-4604-95c6-4320e3570aed
35,methods38," On the other hand, Cordero and colleagues [85] suggested that engaging in structured PA 150–180 min/week during pregnancy could reduce the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) up to 90% when compared to standard care in their randomized controlled trials (RCT). While it can be argued that study design may have an effect on the strength of the results, it cannot be denied that increasing PA appears to have an inverse association with risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Since pregnancy is a temporary phase in a woman’s life, accompanied by many physiological and physical changes, preconception period should be perceived as a window of opportunity to adopt a healthier lifestyle. This could include incorporating more PA, achieving a healthy body mass index (BMI) and following a diet rich in plant-based food groups such as MedDiet to prevent undesirable pregnancy outcomes.  4.3. Strengths and Limitations This study has strengths and limitations.",a1c5da89-5489-41f0-a39d-0bed8dc7e239
36,methods39," Due to strict the selection criteria, a few larger population studies were excluded which may have limited the findings of this review. For example, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA)) study [86] (n = 1488) did not report on the relationship between diet or PA and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but rather differences in health behaviours between the pre-pregnancy period to several years after pregnancy. On the other hand, a study by Deierlein and colleagues [87] (n = 1437) did not report gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) as an outcome measure but used the term ‘hyperglycemia’ instead. Studies that were included in other systematic reviews [67], such as Saldana et al. [88] and He et al. [89], were excluded in our review due to late study recruitment and subsequently collection of dietary data that was not reflective of the early pregnancy period.",8b4e23c3-6d7e-4465-b38f-a50417aca514
37,methods40," Since all included studies are observational, they are susceptible to the effects of bias, confounding, potential measurement error, and under/over reporting of dietary intake. In the meta-analysis of PA, we were able to minimize these effects by using a random-effects model in statistical analysis (assuming heterogeneity) and in all the reviewed studies we conducted independent assessment of study quality, including whether validation of data collection methods had occurred (Table S2). What adds strength to the present study is that different indicators of Leisure Time PA (LTPA) were tested a priori with consistent findings. However, caution should be applied when interpreting sub-analysis of Leisure Time PA (LTPA) studies, particularly as there are <10 data sets available to be able to determine with confidence whether asymmetry is real or a coincidental occurrence [90].  5.",f6ee50ab-adfe-421c-8fd2-258ae96666b0
38,methods41," Conclusions Assuming that the associations we identified reflect causal relationships, our review suggests that a MedDiet and PA are promising interventions for the prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, a greater degree of protection may occur when both lifestyle factors are incorporated before pregnancy and followed throughout pregnancy. Engaging in any PA even below the guidelines suggested a protective association with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk. The finding in part raises the importance of individualized-patient care as the level of PA set in the current guidelines may be unachievable by some, however they could still potentially achieve similar health benefits at a lower PA threshold. There is an opportunity for future randomized controlled trials (RCT)s to further explore interventions with both PA and MedDiet pattern, especially in the pre-conception period to ensure best outcomes throughout pregnancy.",0db3a549-83d6-431e-a84c-3745d4bdb3f3
