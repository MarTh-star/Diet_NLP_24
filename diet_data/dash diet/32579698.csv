0,background0," Hypertension has been recognized as a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases [1]. Approximately 54% of cerebral and 47% of cardiac strokes occur due to hypertension [2]. Over the past 25 years, the number of hypertensive patients and its resultant morbidity and mortality have significantly increased [3]. It has been predicted that by 2025, one out of every three persons will be hypertensive [4]. The hypertension-related morbidity and mortality rate has risen from 97.9 to 106.3 million from 1990 to 2015. Moreover, the disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) has increased from 95.9 to 143 million [3]. Approximately 80% of these problems are seen in low- and middle-income countries [5].  Reducing hypertension and maintaining it in the normal range can prevent its irreparable complications [6].",8c195b5f-9471-44d1-91e9-a310d5c0d482
1,background1," Hypertension management and treatment is a combination of drug therapy, healthy lifestyle changes—such as regular physical activity, abstinence from alcohol and narcotics abuse, maintaining a healthy weight, and a low-sodium diet—and adherence to treatment [1, 2, 4, 7]. It has been reported that a 10-mmHg decrease in blood pressure can significantly reduce the risk of major cardiovascular disease events [8].  Appropriate adherence to treatment can control hypertension and prevent or delay its complications [4, 7, 9]. Nevertheless, since non-adherence prevails, hypertension is not under desirable control [10, 11].  Given the high prevalence of hypertension across the globe, adherence to treatment has become the focus of many health interventions. The latest in this regard is the utilization of smartphone applications and sensors [12]. Nowadays, smartphone technology is widely used by people everywhere. The penetration rate of mobile phones exceeds 85% across the world population [12].",2845e3bd-8266-4606-91a2-4702ea65afe6
2,background2," In Iran too, the penetration rate reached 104.13% from 22% between the years 2006 and 2017 [13]. With a penetration rate of 43.20%, Iran holds the 17th position in the world [14]. The emergence of smartphones has been associated with their utilization in reducing the gaps in access to patients and has been associated with improvements in health services. mHealth is increasingly being used in medical and health fields and for self-management of various health conditions [15].  Many studies have investigated the effectiveness of utilizing smartphone applications, and most of them have reported desirable effectiveness [16–18]. mHealth technologies have experienced rapid and extensive geographical development and have been used across multiple countries due to their appeal, popularity, low cost, and outreach beyond spatial and temporal constraints. Given their low cost, developing countries have especially used the smartphone’s capabilities to educate patients [19].",f13c511f-990e-47f8-94ec-bd1a44257cb3
3,background3,"  We used the Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling Constructs in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation (PRECEDE) conceptual framework to design the educational package of this study (in the form of a smartphone application). The PRECEDE model is a health promotion model that has been recognized as an efficient means of designing and implementing educational interventions [20]. This clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the Blood Pressure Management Application (Blood Pressure Management Application (BPmean arterial pressure (MAP))) application in promoting adherence to pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in patients with primary hypertension in Iran among those attending academic medical centers.

This article was written using the CONSORT 2010 checklist (See Additional file 1).  Study setting  The “Tehran Heart Center” is a tertiary referral cardiovascular subspecialty medical center affiliated to “Tehran University of Medical Sciences” in Iran. Each year, the center has about 113,000 outpatients and 24,000 admissions and performs 4000 open heart surgeries [21].  Participants  The participants included patients with primary hypertension diagnosed and confirmed by their physician.",15232156-5f5a-41bb-9fb4-cd5b9cafce45

Outcomes (primary and secondary)  Adherence to antihypertensive medication was considered as the primary outcome, assessed with the 14-item Hill-Bone Scale (range 14–70) [24]. The secondary outcomes included clinical and behavioral outcomes, such as adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, reduced sodium and fat intake, regular blood pressure monitoring, physical activity, and predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors in adherence to treatment. Clinical outcomes were measured by a physician, and other outcomes were measured by a questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by a trained researcher.",c3bd7db6-e944-498d-9346-0ffe2566ffa7
8,methods4,"  Adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and sodium reduction  The intake of salt, fat, low-fat dairy products, fruits, and vegetables over the past week was evaluated.  Regular blood pressure monitoring  The frequency of blood pressure in the application was recorded in the study period.  Physical activity  The degree of change in the frequency and time allocated to physical activity was evaluated in two categories of moderate and severe physical activity.  Predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors in adherence to treatment  The effect of these factors was evaluated based on the questionnaire items.  Sample size  We calculated that a total of 120 people (60 in each group) would be needed to achieve a power of 80 (1−β) to detect at least a 5-score (SD = 10) difference on the Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Scale [24] using the two-sided T test at the significance level of 5% (α).",580cec83-0d22-4cc9-99ba-b7064cca28c4

The random sequence was generated using permuted block randomization with a block size of four and a 1:1 allocation ratio.  Implementation  Individuals were given 1 week to review and consult with the family to read and sign the informed consent form. After the participants signed the informed consent, the initial assessment questionnaire was completed by a trained interviewer (Fig. 1). The application was installed on the mobile phones of the intervention group, and instructions were provided to the patients individually.

The patients’ sphygmomanometers were calibrated at the time of application installation to ensure correct measurement of blood pressure at home.  Follow-up assessments  Participants in both groups had an initial visit and six follow-up visits. The first 5 visits were performed at 2-week intervals, and the last one was done 24 weeks after the first visit (Table 1).

It contained 68 questions for assessing 6 domains. The domains and the number of questions in each are as follows: (a) physical and biochemical measurements (9); (b) assessment of disease history (7); (c) assessment of health behaviors—such as smoking (4), nutritional diet (5), and physical activity (6); (d) predisposing (18), enabling (2), and reinforcing factors (3) of adherence; and (e) Hill-Bone adherence to treatment questionnaire (14).",2bfa0107-7235-42e2-92e6-8b5867f84b99

To monitor blood pressure, the recorded blood pressure measurements of the intervention group were entered in the relevant section of the software. A recording frequency of 30 times was expected in the intervention group. Recordings of more than 25 times were considered desirable. The recordings of 84.7% of the application users (50 people) were appropriate. (further data on the users’ activity in the app are provided in Supplementary file 2: Table 2).  The estimated mean of moderate physical activity over the study period was 247.3 (95% CI 223.7–267.5) in the intervention group and 102.7 (95% CI 100.4–176.8) in the control group, indicating an increase of 100.0 min per week (95% CI 61.7–138.3) in the intervention group.

20,discussion0," Adherence to treatment in chronic diseases is of paramount importance, which is estimated at 50–60%. Currently, mHealth is increasingly applied to address this problem [22]. The results of this study showed that the use of Blood Pressure Management Application (BPmean arterial pressure (MAP)) by hypertensive patients resulted in an increase of 5.86 points in patient adherence to medications.  Evidence suggests that 65% of mHealth studies have increased adherence to drug therapy and in some cases have been able to increase patients’ self-efficacy and self-care by sending encouraging messages [27, 28]. However, most of these studies have used text messages and notifications only [28, 29].",ee8d4e62-5579-4c5d-a81c-ddd0ed7c422c
21,discussion1," It seems that the significant effects of improving adherence to treatment, presented in this study, were due to paying attention to its different aspects and its holistic view, such as, access to treatment knowledge, drug reminders, sending knowledge-based and single-sentence encouraging messages, recording of blood pressure measurements at home, and getting feedback about the recorded numbers.  In Blood Pressure Management Application (BPmean arterial pressure (MAP)) users, the number of vegetables, fruit, and dairy portions increased, and the consumption of salt and fat decreased. A study was conducted to improve nutritional status using desktop computers, the results of which indicated an increase in the consumption of vegetables and cereal grains [30]. The use of technology to improve nutritional status appears to be effective.",2e152f90-d585-42fb-957d-075c4d2b24a9
22,discussion2," Although these studies have not examined the effect of evidence in the long run, it seems that the use of new technologies along with medical treatment is useful.  Blood pressure monitoring at home is increasingly accepted and used by patients and has desirable and helpful impacts on clinical interventions. In the present study, the blood pressure measurement reminder and increased knowledge of the disease have led to regular monitoring of blood pressure at home. About 84.5% of Blood Pressure Management Application (BPmean arterial pressure (MAP)) users measured and recorded their blood pressure more than 25 times over a period of 2 months. Measurement of blood pressure at home keeps individuals informed of their blood pressure status and promotes adherence to treatment, which can lead to optimal blood pressure control [31].  Regular physical activity is an effective factor in controlling hypertension and improving one’s health.",251d7cb5-fa26-422d-ab95-93eb07627818
23,discussion3," In addition to knowledge about the importance of regular physical activity on appropriate blood pressure control, encouraging messages were sent via the application at 3-day intervals, which increased the average physical activity of Blood Pressure Management Application (BPmean arterial pressure (MAP)) users by 100 min per week. A similar finding was found in studies conducted in the UK [32] and Taiwan [33]. Contradictory results were also reported on the ineffectiveness of encouraging messages on increased physical activity in a study by Nguyen et al. in the USA [34]. The difference in the effectiveness of encouraging messages can be attributed to the quality, relevance, and format of the messages sent. Accordingly, it is essential to pay attention to the indicators of effective messages when designing them.",e572da7d-806f-412f-8f9d-d0599beb35f7
24,discussion4,"  Although pharmacological treatment is as important as non-pharmacological therapies in controlling blood pressure, in clinical settings, especially in non-private healthcare systems in which many visits are made, non-pharmacological recommendations are not sufficiently addressed. In these conditions, the use of other methods, such as providing enough and necessary information to patients can improve the level of knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, and adherence to treatment. A systematic review by Marshall et al. in 16 countries revealed that the lack of awareness of the causes and symptoms of hypertension, fear of the drugs’ side effects, and their dependency are the major causes of treatment discontinuation and lack of adherence to treatment [35, 36]. In this study, Blood Pressure Management Application (BPmean arterial pressure (MAP)) provided the users with the necessary knowledge which had been identified in pre-intervention studies.",b71c1c4e-e43e-4ff2-b894-f5b7b20441bf
25,discussion5," Raising public awareness about hypertension and the necessary measures of self-management can help improve individuals’ adherence to pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Therefore, the use of technologies such as mobile applications is recommended in these cases.  In spite of mHealth’s appeal, popularity, low cost, and outreach beyond spatial and temporal constraints, our study had its limitations, which were as follows: the self-report nature of the questionnaire and the need to register the measurements in the application, and the necessity of owning an Android smartphone. Furthermore, our study was not blinded. If our consultant physicians and participants had positive attitudes toward the effects of the application on adherence, they may have been more inclined to detect or express positive results.  Conclusion  Hypertension is a multifactorial disease that requires a multifaceted approach if it is to be properly controlled.",e4e526a1-f4b1-48f9-ae55-eed62601fd3e
26,discussion6," In order to achieve this multifaceted approach, utilizing smartphone capabilities can be a good alternative to drug therapy alone, given their low costs and high penetration. In addition to regular consumption of drugs, patients also need to fully adhere to pharmacological and non-pharmacological recommendations. The present study showed that the proper use of Blood Pressure Management Application (BPmean arterial pressure (MAP)) is effective in raising the level of knowledge, controlling the factors influencing adherence to treatment, and having access to family support. Given the participants of this study were visiting a non-private center in Iran, the authors believe that this approach could be a successful tool for self-management of hypertension in similar settings in many developing countries.
