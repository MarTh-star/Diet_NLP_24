0,background0," Low socio-economic position is associated with consumption of lower quality diets, which may be partly explained by the cost of healthier diets. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the mediating role of dietary costs in the association between educational level and diet quality. ",b3e44dbf-d9bf-49ac-9c72-518eb2767678
1,methods0," Study population  The flowchart of the study population is visualized in Fig. 1. This cross-sectional study used data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort in the Netherlands (EPIC-NL) [18]. EPIC-NL consists of two Dutch cohorts, namely the Prospect cohort and MORGEN cohort. Participants from the Prospect cohort were females aged 50–70 years recruited from the national breast cancer screening program in Utrecht and its surroundings, while participants from the MORGEN cohort were aged 20–59 years, and selected from random samples of the Dutch population in three large cities in the Netherlands [18]. At baseline (1993–1997), participants filled in questionnaires and underwent a physical examination. The participants have been followed since for changes in risk factors and occurrence of chronic diseases. Fig.",06909df5-2df0-4a51-9302-75ddb447b0ba
2,methods1," 1 Flowchart of the study population  In 2015, respondents to the 2011 questionnaire on electromagnetic radiation (electromagnetic radiation (EMR)) [18] who were still alive, living in the Netherlands and who gave informed consent to be re-contacted (n = 13,421) were invited to fill out a Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)). Participants from the Doetinchem cohort did not receive the electromagnetic radiation (EMR) questionnaire. Therefore, participants who at that time already participated in the 6th round of the Doetinchem cohort study (n = 1528) were invited to fill in the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). The response rate to the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) from 2015 was 62.9% (n = 9399). For the current study, participants were excluded if they had implausible energy intake levels according to the lower or upper 0.5% ratio of reported energy intake over estimated energy requirement (n = 93) [19].",042605c3-4d8f-4f77-85e3-3ae609204923
3,methods2," Ultimately, data from a total of 9306 participants was used for analysis in the current study.  Dietary assessment  Dietary intake was assessed in 2015 using the validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)-NL 1.0 [20]. The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)-NL 1.0 contained questions regarding the consumption and preparation methods of 160 food items during the prior year. Intake for each food item was reported in frequencies ranging from “never” to “7 days a week”. The servings were specified in terms of household measures or units of common portions such as one egg and one slice of bread. Using the 2011 computerized Dutch food composition table, dietary intake data yielded dietary energy intake (MJ and kcal) and the average daily intake of 43 macro- and micronutrients [20]. This Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) was validated against on average 2.7 (range 1–5) telephone-based 24 h recalls as well as biomarkers in 24-h urine and blood samples.",3aa7e700-20c4-40c4-8a16-97bdbedf4a1e
4,methods3," Correlation coefficients based on estimates of the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and 24 h recalls ranged between 0.18 for fats, oils and sauces and 0.99 for soy and vegetarian products [20].  Adherence to dietary guideline measures  Using the dietary intake data, adherence to the Dutch Dietary Guidelines was assessed with the Healthy Diet index 2015 (DHD15-index). The DHD15-index is developed for the Dutch population and is based on absolute intakes of selected foods. To allow comparison with international literature, adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) diet was also assessed, and represents a relative measure of dietary quality [21].  The DHD15-index was calculated as described by Looman et al. [22].",7239e61d-56cb-4069-92e4-760b31a52081
5,methods4," Briefly, The Health Council of the Netherlands released updated Dutch Food-based dietary guidelines in 2015, in which all evidence on nutrients, foods, and dietary patterns in relation to the most important chronic diseases and related risk-factors was integrated. To measure adherence to these guidelines, the DHD15-index was constructed. The index consists of 15 components (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, dairy, fish, tea, fats and oils, coffee, red meat, processed meat, sweetened beverages and fruit juices, alcohol and salt) which were assigned a score based on absolute intake of the specific food group. For all components a minimum of 0 points and a maximum of 10 points could be allocated, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 150 points, with higher score indicating better adherence to the guidelines.",a122eb74-7bb9-4154-a6cd-736d66efd345
6,methods5," In EPIC-NL, data regarding filtered coffee was not available and estimates of salt intake were not included given the complexity of measuring intake using Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)s. Also, as previous studies excluded alcohol beverages because of their disproportionate influence on dietary costs due to their high price [23, 24], this component was excluded from the DHD15-index in the main analyses, thus the DHD15-index ranged from 0 to 120. Supplementary Table 1 includes the components of the DHD15-index and their minimum and maximum score values.  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was originally developed as an intervention to prevent hypertension [25]. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet focuses on 8 components: high intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy products and whole grains, and low intake of sodium, sugary sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats [21].",9b568b65-a4ab-4cb6-b56b-b362a1b5bc4e
7,methods6," The components of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet as proposed by Fung et al. were used to calculate adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [21]. For each component, participants were classified into quintiles according to their intake ranking. For components where a high intake is desired, participants in quintile 1 received one point and participants in quintile 5 received five points. For components where a low intake is desired, scoring was reversed (i.e. quintile 1 equals 5 points and quintile 5 equals 1 point). Participants in the quintiles between the lowest and highest quintiles received a score of 2, 3 or 4. Then, component scores were summed to obtain an overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence score for each individual participant ranging from 7 to 35 (as previously mentioned, the sodium component was not calculated in this study).",2d423320-2224-448d-9073-6f685ac673e5
8,methods7," A higher score indicated better adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Supplementary Table 2 includes the components of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the mean intake for the lowest and highest quintiles.  Dietary cost measure  Individual dietary costs were derived using established methods [8, 14, 15]. A Dutch food price database was used to link food prices to individual food consumption as measured with the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). A detailed description of the construction of this food price database can be found elsewhere [26]. Briefly, the food price database was developed in the summer of 2017 and covered 902 prices of foods based on a commonly used Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) in Dutch cohorts [27]. This database included the retail prices of the lowest, non-promotional prices collected from two Dutch supermarket chains (i.e.",411fd0f4-6901-49b7-aad3-2f5489060aa5
9,methods8,", a high segment supermarket Albert Heijn and a discount supermarket Lidl) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. All prices in the food price database were adjusted for preparation and waste and were expressed in Euros (€) per 100 g edible portion [28]. Approximately 47% of all food products (n = 649) underlying the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)-NL 1.0 could directly be linked to the retail prices in our database. For 581 products, we linked the price of a comparable product to the consumed foods. For example, we used the price for Roosvicee syrup for both regular and multivitamine Roosvicee syrup. A few products (n = 78) that were assessed during the dietary intake assessment in 2015 were no longer sold when collecting the retail food prices in 2017. Furthermore, for a small number of foods (n = 27), no comparable product with a known price could be found in the database.",2c788c3c-4796-4bc1-bf32-a91682c201c7
10,methods9," Thus, the lowest available, non-promotional prices for these products were newly collected from two supermarket chains holding the largest market shares in the Netherlands (i.e. Albert Heijn and Jumbo). Once the dataset was complete, dietary costs were calculated by combining data from the food price database with the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)-NL 1.0 intake data. Each composite food item in the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) (total of 160 items) consists of a number of individual food items, weighted according to their relative contribution to the intake of that food in the Netherlands. We used the same weighting factor to calculate the cost of each composite Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) food item. The variable obtained for each participant was the average monetary value of their habitual diet (reported dietary intake in the last year) in euros per day.",9818b714-c1a0-4383-a2cb-981c34d04d85
11,methods10," Additional information regarding the food price database and the linking to Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) data can be found in Supplementary file 1.  Educational level measures  Based on the highest level of completed school education reported at baseline (1993–1997), three educational groups were constructed (low, middle and high) for participants and (if applicable) their partner. Those who completed primary education or intermediate vocational education were classified as having a low educational level, those who completed higher secondary education were classified as having a middle educational level and those who completed higher vocational education or university were classified as having a high educational level.",b9229642-d7cd-4e6f-82f4-8af53be60908
12,methods11," Because educational level may vary for different birth cohorts and given the high proportion of older women whose own educational level may not reflect their socio economic position (SEP) accurately [29], their partner’s educational level was used in addition to construct a household education level variable as a second indicator of socio economic position (SEP). Thus, two educational level variables were used for analyses: highest obtained individual educational level and highest household educational level (the highest attained educational level for either the participant or the partner of the participant). If a participant did not have a partner, then their own educational level was used as the highest attained educational level for the household.  Covariates  Self-reported data on age and sex were obtained using the baseline questionnaire. Additionally, energy intake was derived from the dietary intake data obtained from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)-NL 1.0.",93d0876a-629e-46d5-b357-deefea20ed3b
13,methods12," Study recruitment area (Amsterdam, Doetinchem, Utrecht and Maastricht) was also used as covariate. Because the association between socio economic position (SEP) and diet quality differed for males versus females and adults from varying age groups in earlier studies, effect modification by age and sex was investigated [12, 30].  Statistical analyses  Descriptive statistics were computed for all variables, using percentages and means with standard deviations. Item-nonresponse ranged from 0% (age, sex, study center, DHD15-index and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score) to 0.33% (individual educational level). Complete case analysis was used for all analyses. Using the Hayes SPSS-macro PROCESS [31], the mediating role of dietary cost in the association between individual and household educational level and adherence to the diet quality measures (i.e.",84c87ea8-d2d2-4825-bca1-5c576db5b547
14,methods13," the DHD15-index and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet) were assessed using multiple linear regression analyses. Figure 2 illustrates the mediating role of dietary cost in the association between individual and household educational level and diet quality. Instead of running all regression analyses separately, the package PROCESS allowed for an easier and faster estimation of the paths by running these simultaneously. Total effects were estimated by assessing the associations between individual and household educational level and the diet quality measures separately (c-path). Also, the association between the educational level variables and the potential mediator dietary cost was assessed (a-path). Furthermore, the associations between dietary cost and the diet quality measures adjusted for the educational level variables (b-path) and between the educational level measures and the diet quality measures adjusted for dietary cost (c’-path) were assessed.",e26bcf2f-4d99-4629-9c7c-0be6f5d6a46d
15,methods14," All analyses were adjusted for the covariates age, sex, study center and energy intake. Modification by age and sex was assessed using interaction terms age and both educational level measures and sex and both educational level measures on the c-path, a-path, b-path and c’-path. If one of the interaction terms was significant in at least one of the paths, associations were stratified by that effect modifier. In order to assess whether dietary cost indeed mediated the association between individual and household educational levels and the DHD15-index and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, the indirect effect and the corresponding 95% confidence interval were assessed. The indirect effects were calculated by multiplying the regression coefficient of the a-path with the regression coefficient of the b-path, which is equal to subtracting the regression coefficient of the c’-path from the regression coefficient of the c-path.",f3e59fb9-cd40-4f4e-9013-78b4e0aeb8c1
16,methods15," The bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals around the indirect effects were based on 5000 bootstrap resamples. Statistical significance of the indirect effects was defined by the inclusion or exclusion of the value zero in the upper and lower bound of the bias corrected 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. As recommended by Hayes [31], the proportion mediated (a*b divided by a*b + c’) was calculated, but only if 1) significant mediation was found, 2) the total (c path) and indirect (a-path * b-path) effect had the same direction and 3) if the indirect effect was smaller than the total effect. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding participants (n = 529 for individual educational level and n = 531 for household educational level) below the age of 30 at the time of the baseline questionnaire (i.e. between 1993 and 1997), since their educational attainment may have changed between baseline and follow-up.",70b54b44-e6df-483c-90f0-5dd76c6c5471

These effects accounted for 4.5 and 2.2% of the difference in the DHD15-index score between middle and high versus low individual educational levels, respectively (Supplementary Table 3; proportion mediated). No mediating role of dietary cost in the association between high versus middle individual educational level and the DHD15-index was found.

For the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, stronger mediating effects were found for participants older than 65 years compared to participants younger than 65 years (Table 3). Within both dietary quality measures, sub-group analyses showed that dietary cost explained between 3 and 12% of the differences between educational level and dietary quality for females, while no mediation effect was found for males (Table 4).

27,discussion0," This study used a large cohort of older Dutch adults to investigate to what extent dietary costs explain educational differences in diet quality. We observed a modest association of individual and household educational level with diet quality as measured by adherence to the 2015 Dutch nutrition guidelines and adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. A small part of this association was explained by dietary costs, such that mediation effects were mostly only present in females and adults older than 65 years compared to males and adults younger than 65 years.  In line with previous findings [6, 30, 32], we observed that higher educational levels were associated with healthier dietary behaviors. We hypothesized that educational differences in diet quality would be partly explained by dietary costs, because high quality diets (e.g., diets containing plenty of fruits and vegetables and less red meats) tend to be more costly than lower quality diets [13, 33].",7040a8d2-653e-4489-83b7-a8df601ad5a4
28,discussion1," Indeed, a €1 increase in daily dietary costs was associated with a 0.29-point higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, which is comparable to the results of a previous study [34]. Dietary cost explained between 2 and 7% of the association between educational level and diet quality measures. The somewhat larger explanatory role of dietary cost in the association between educational level and diet quality for females (proportion mediated between 2 and 12%) and adults older than 65 (proportion mediated between 3 and 11%) may be explained by differences in competing factors such as perceived quality, price, taste, habits, intentions to eat healthily and family preferences for females versus males and older adults versus younger adults [35]. For example, a study among European adults showed that while price was among the top four important factors influencing food choices for females, this was not the case for males [35].",e38c9141-9c31-4cf2-9ac7-97e15019ac7d
29,discussion2," As noted in two previous studies [23, 24], the in- or exclusion of the alcohol component in the DHD15-index had a significant impact on the association between dietary costs and diet quality.  Compared to previous studies [14–16], this study found relatively small mediation effects by dietary cost in the association between educational level and diet quality measures for which the explanation may be two-fold. Firstly, the type of socio-economic indicator may play a role. Socio-economic indicators including income, educational level and occupation are not interchangeable, as they assess different aspects of socio economic position (SEP) [36]. Educational level is thought to better reflect knowledge-related assets, while income may reflect material circumstances such as grocery shopping budget better [37]. While income and education were not differentially associated with daily dietary costs in a population from the United Kingdom [8], this may differ from country to country.",87470739-4057-43ca-805b-8813c02ad783
30,discussion3," A study by Aggarwal et al. found larger mediation effects with the socio economic position (SEP) indicator income, e.g., 76% of the association between income and energy density and 36% of the association between income and the mean adequacy ratio (i.e., a truncated index of the percent of daily recommended intakes for key nutrients) could be explained by dietary cost [14]. In contrast, a study by Waterlander et al. found that level of income was not associated with food expenses [38]. This leads us to the second explanation, namely that in the Netherlands, dietary costs may play a smaller role in the association between socio economic position (SEP) and dietary quality due to the relatively low cost of food compared to other countries and other consumer goods. According to European Union (EU), the prices of food and non-alcohol beverages in the Netherlands is around the EU average, which is lower compared to other West-European countries [39].",ab101f79-962f-41df-99c2-6070948bf43f
31,discussion4,"  The limited explanatory power of dietary cost also warrants discussion about other potential factors that explain socio economic position (SEP) inequalities in diet quality. Socio-economic inequalities are traditionally explained through three mechanisms; the material explanation, the behavioral explanation and the psychosocial explanation [40]. While several studies have examined these explanatory mechanisms separately, it would be of interest to study the relative contribution of dietary costs compared to other explanatory factors [41]. Other explanatory factors may include access to healthy foods, other aspects of the food environment and psychosocial resources such as knowledge of healthy eating, cooking skills, food literacy or social support. Thus, before developing new interventions, future studies should focus on providing insights into the most relevant causes and mechanisms that underlie socioeconomic differences in diet quality.",ba9be16f-7aef-497f-85c5-88c9da83bdea
32,discussion5," It is only then that interventions can be adequately designed and tailored to the needs and capacities of the target population. Some interventions to date that have increased dietary quality without increasing socio-economic inequalities include subsidies on healthy foods [42] and sugar sweetened beverage taxes [43].  The results of this study should be interpreted within the context of its strengths and limitations. A first strength is the use of a detailed food price database that could be linked to individual food intake using established techniques. Second, we used a diet quality indicator that was relevant for the study population (DHD15) and a diet quality indicator that is widely used in the international literature (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)). The first limitation is the use of data from an older Dutch population, limiting the generalizability of the results.",f4c5c22a-29aa-40f4-bd94-9ab0a3a1ca82
33,discussion6," However, given that data was collected across different regions in the Netherlands, the generalizability of the results can be increased to the entire older Dutch population. Second, mediation analyses were based on cross sectional data, and therefore we cannot make inferences about causality [14]. For example, it is possible that higher educational level leads to more dietary knowledge, in turn leading to a healthier diet, and that this healthier diet leads to higher dietary costs, and vice versa [16]. Third, the dietary cost measure (as derived from reported dietary intake with a fixed food price database) is not suitable for estimating actual expenditure, since price data regarding the cheapest available product, instead of the actual consumed product, was collected. However, our current measure of dietary costs is found to be moderately associated with actual food expenditure, and able to rank individuals on the basis of the monetary value of their diets [44].",83f9a068-1d05-401f-a509-1e7c6b3e4a14
34,discussion7," Furthermore, our conservative approach of only using the lowest available prices is more likely to have led to an underestimation than to an overestimation of the mediating role of dietary cost in the educational level and diet quality pathway [16]. Fourth, the dietary cost measure data was collected 2 years after the dietary intake data. Within these 2 years, the prices of foods may have increased due to inflation. However, given that this type of time-varying bias would not systematically misclassify people of different dietary or social characteristics, the ranking of individuals has likely not changed in the period of 2015 to 2017. Fifth, while the validity of the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) used in this study has been documented, the limitations of Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)s are well-known [45]. One such limitation includes the fact that dietary intake may be under- or overreported.",94609a12-5337-4e7d-9f5c-d0cf9e9ca34a
35,discussion8," Underreporting may especially be the case for participants with a lower education [46]. However, what effect this may have on the results is currently unknown and beyond the scope of this paper. Sixth, unfortunately data on other important socio economic position (SEP) proxies such as income was not collected, potentially resulting in an underestimation of the mediating role of dietary cost in the relation between socio economic position (SEP) and dietary quality.  Conclusion  Dietary costs seems to play a modest role in explaining educational differences in diet quality in an older Dutch population, such that mediation effects were mostly only present in females and adults older than 65 years compared to males and adults younger than 65 years. The results of this study suggest that further research is needed to investigate which other factors may explain socio economic position (SEP) differences in diet quality.",fde1435a-fd83-44b7-859a-651f636e7935
36,discussion9," A multi-factorial approach is needed to tackle socio-economic differences in diet, not only focusing on the cost of food, but also other factors such as food knowledge and access to healthy foods.
