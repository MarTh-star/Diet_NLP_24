0,introduction0,"More than 100 million Americans have high blood pressure [1], the primary risk factor for heart disease and stroke, which are two of the leading causes of death in the United States [2]. In 2017, the American Heart Association implemented new guidelines for the detection, prevention, and treatment of high blood pressure [3]. These guidelines lowered the thresholds for what is considered an optimal blood pressure, which resulted in about 30 million more Americans requiring treatment for high blood pressure, including 13 million more women [1,3,4]. Many of these women, however, present with atypical risk factors for high blood pressure and may not receive the treatment they need [5]. Participation of women in blood pressure trials is disproportionately lower, and there is a need for a lifestyle treatment that is tailored for women [6].",e27749c3-15c1-4393-8537-b7bd44f1731e
1,introduction1," Lifestyle treatment is indicated for all individuals with high blood pressure regardless of whether medication is also indicated, but it is the first line of treatment for those in the elevated blood pressure category [3].  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) dietary pattern is an evidence-based lifestyle treatment to lower blood pressure [7]. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) emphasizes nutrient-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, and limits red meat and processed foods [8]. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) was specifically designed to increase nutrient consumption of calcium, magnesium, potassium, fiber, and protein and reduce the intake of saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol [8].",59d91d09-9021-445a-8207-2981e80af11e
2,introduction2," The initial Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial, which compared a typical US diet to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern among adults with nonmedicated high blood pressure, resulted in a decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 5.5 and 3.0 mmHg, respectively [7]. The blood pressure–lowering effects of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) have been replicated in multiple trials [9-11].  As such, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is recommended in national blood pressure [3,12] and dietary [13] guidelines. However, the adoption of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) on a population level remains poor [14]. Fewer than 1% of US adults are fully adherent to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and only 20% meet half of the recommendations of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) [9,15].",89a52051-8a4a-4723-99eb-62619844aceb
3,introduction3," This indicates a need for improved dissemination and support to increase population uptake and adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH).  Smartphones are a promising channel for disseminating and supporting Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence. More than three-quarters of Americans have smartphones, with high rates of ownership across all socioeconomic strata [16]. Diet and fitness smartphone apps account for 43% [16,17] of mobile medical apps, with the most popular apps having 50 million users [18]. These publicly available apps are primarily diet trackers that ask users to enter all foods and beverages consumed and then link those data with nutritional databases. Although popular, these apps lack evidence-based components known to produce behavior change, such as consistent self-monitoring, goal setting, problem-solving skills, feedback, and social support [19,20].",b46e4830-292b-4590-837c-9aabebff9ae9
4,introduction4," To address this, we can create programs that combine these publicly available apps with evidence-based behavior change principles to improve dissemination of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH).  In the current study, we created the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud intervention. Using data collected through a commercial diet-tracking smartphone app, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud provides tailored feedback via text messages about adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), accompanied by motivational messages designed to support behavior change. We tested the feasibility of the intervention among women with high blood pressure using a randomized controlled study design. The 3-month trial compared the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud intervention to diet tracking alone on adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH).",0631ba0e-158a-48a0-a87e-66bdc288cbc1
5,introduction5," Using the principles of feasibility outlined by Leon et al [21], feasibility was determined based on successful recruitment and retention and the successful implementation of the intervention. We hypothesized that women receiving the 3-month Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud intervention would have (1) greater rates of diet tracking and (2) greater adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH).

6,methods0,"Study Design and Eligibility We recruited women aged 21 to 70 years with a BMI of >18.5 kg/m2. Women were eligible if they self-reported being diagnosed with hypertension, using medication for blood pressure, or having a recent systolic measurement of 120 to 159 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure measurement of 80 to 99 mmHg. They were required to have a smartphone with the latest operating system or be willing to update to the current version, have a data plan, and be willing to receive daily text messages. Having an email address and fluency in English were also required. Participants were excluded if they had a cardiovascular event in the last 6 months or a current cancer diagnosis, had been institutionalized for a psychiatric disorder within the past year, or if they were pregnant, lactating, or enrolled in another dietary change study.",1b755905-b353-45ca-aae5-179d1e49a5cd
7,methods1,"  Eligible participants were redirected to an online consent form to review and sign, which included both a brief video that described the study and a written version. Participants then completed online surveys and attended baseline study visits at our study offices. During the first baseline visit, participants’ height, weight, blood pressure, and depression status were measured.  At the first baseline visit, participants downloaded and were instructed on how to use the Nutritionix diet-tracking app (Syndigo LLC) and asked to track their diet for a week to assess their ability to track using the study app. Participants came back for a second baseline visit 1 week later if they tracked a minimum of 4 consecutive days. During the second baseline visit, participants were randomized using a permuted block design with random block sizes ranging from 4 to 8.",70b2289c-cf9b-48f8-9ca8-87ab4b458f71
8,methods2," An allocation table was created by a biostatistician using Sealed Envelope and uploaded to a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) project. Allocation was revealed to unblinded research staff upon random assignment by the REDCap software, allowing the research staff to orient the participant to either the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud intervention or an active comparator arm. Participants had a follow-up visit after 3 months. Participants were compensated US $25 at the second baseline visit and the 3-month follow-up visit. All study protocols were in accordance with the ethical standards of Duke University and were approved by the Duke University Health Center institutional review board. The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on July 12, 2017 (NCT03215472).",fb52a0da-7348-41fc-b120-092f9baaa022
9,methods3,"  Recruitment Participants were recruited using a multipronged approach, including (1) flyers distributed to gyms, community centers, grocery stores, and health and wellness clinics throughout Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina; (2) study details posted on Research Match, a national clinical trials registry that matches participants to studies; (3) social media posts on Twitter, Facebook, and Nextdoor; and (4) contact with participants who were ineligible for other studies but showed interest in similar behavioral studies.",8499d0c1-a809-466a-9b95-64dc0f14d47d
10,methods4,"  Intervention Description The intervention included (1) daily diet tracking using the Nutritionix app; (2) daily or weekly text messages that included tailored feedback on adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), motivational messages to boost adherence, and tips for specific dietary changes; (3) animated videos designed to increase skills around different topics related to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH); and (4) the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) booklet available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)) [22].  Daily Diet Tracking All participants were asked to use Nutritionix daily and enter all foods and beverages consumed. Like many commercial diet apps, Nutritionix primarily provides tracking capabilities. The app interface includes options to enter foods by meal and time of day and includes small pictures of each food.",2c064e4f-526c-4d03-899b-f8b2eb48dc50
11,methods5," Nutritionix also has a comprehensive and easily accessible nutrient database supporting entries into the app. This database includes all data available from the United States Department of Agriculture (United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)) Food Composition Database, data from restaurant chains, and foods added by registered dietitians staffed by Nutritionix. Dietary data were automatically uploaded from the Nutritionix app daily via an application programing interface (application programing interface (API)). The application programing interface (API) connects the Nutritionix server to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud intervention delivery system, which uses servers stored in a platform operated out of the Duke Global Digital Health Science Center called Prompt. As is common with nutrient databases [23], not all foods available in the Nutritionix database had complete nutrient data.",60fa6fd8-fa0e-441f-ab02-1eacfbdd8e40
12,methods6," For example, magnesium and potassium were nutrients we used in our Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) algorithm that were often not available for many foods. As such, to ensure we had complete nutrient data, our registered dietitians on staff manually filled in any missing nutrient data that were received via the Nutritionix application programing interface (API).  Feedback Texts Using an automated algorithm, the intervention platform sent daily feedback via text message at 12:00 PM EST for the first 2 weeks and weekly feedback via text message for the remainder of the study (Figure 1). We opted to send the texts daily during the first 2 weeks to provide feedback proximal to the specific food choice. After 2 weeks, we switched to giving feedback weekly to reduce the potential burden from texting daily. This decision was based on balancing the concept of proximal feedback with the perceived burden from frequent notifications.",78b1db1b-f528-4f98-9c46-cedcf3723fcd
13,methods7," The feedback message began with a personalized greeting (eg, “Hello, [name]”) and the participant’s Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet adherence score from the previous day (eg, “Your Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score yesterday was 5.5”). This score was calculated using the Mellen et al [15] index to evaluate Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence based on nutrient targets. The score uses a 9-point scale based on the previous day’s intake for potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, saturated fat, total fat, total protein, cholesterol, and fiber. Our algorithm compared the total intake and the recommended targets for these nutrients in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). Similar to the Mellen et al [15] index, our software platform was coded to automatically apply a score of 0, 0.5, or 1 to each nutrient based on its difference from the recommended target.",d4b26d15-fd11-4ef0-bb52-f4f94a9a9e80
14,methods8," The texts included feedback on which nutrients met the target and tips for improving nutrient intake for those that were suboptimal (eg, “You did best with reducing saturated fat and boosting your fiber intake and seemed to struggle with getting enough potassium and magnesium”).  Feedback also included motivational messages regarding changes in the overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and prompted participants to reflect on which dietary choices most impacted their Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. Each week on Sunday afternoons, we also sent a separate text message about a different topic related to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) (eg, “Dining out on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH),” with links to animated educational videos).",7b12238d-42ce-4107-9728-b11ca857a47c
15,methods9," Overall, these text messages were intended to be motivational by offering behavioral tips to reinforce dietary change and providing social support for women at risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease. We aimed to tailor the intervention content for women and, in particular, improve understanding of the risks specific to women regarding cardiovascular disease. Participants were not expected to respond, and an automatic reply was sent if participants did respond indicating that they could reach out for support to our staff via email.  Figure 1 Sample text message sent to participants in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud intervention. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH): Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.  Active Comparator Arm Participants in the active comparator arm were asked to track their diet daily using the Nutritionix app and were shown a video that introduced the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern.",388112f5-863e-4ad5-8b0f-294feb5e38b9
16,methods10," They were asked to try to follow Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) guidelines. However, unlike the intervention arm, they did not receive any of the text messages, which included tailored feedback and skills training videos. Active comparator participants received the same publicly available booklet from National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) with information about the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.  Measures Baseline Sociodemographic and Psychosocial Variables To characterize participants, we measured various sociodemographic and psychosocial variables. Sociodemographic measures were collected at baseline using standard survey questions used in previous studies. This included age, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, employment, insurance status, and the number of children within the household. Depression was assessed using the validated 8-item survey from the Patient Health Questionnaire [24].",ab89e9d5-c818-4abe-ba99-fcc42ed26e6b
17,methods11," The scale ranges from 0 to 24, and a score of >10 indicates depression.  Anthropometrics Weight and height were collected by study staff and BMI was calculated for each participant. Height was measured twice and recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm using a wall-mounted height rod (Portrod; Health O Meter). Weight was measured twice and recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg using a scale (Scale-Tronix 5005; Welch Allyn).  Engagement With Diet Tracking Engagement was operationalized as a valid day tracked, determined by looking at overall caloric intake. A day with missing data or a daily caloric level of <600 calories was considered to be a day that did not have complete tracking data and was marked invalid [25]. We assessed the average days tracked per week and calculated the proportion of participants who tracked at least 5 days per week.",c8736034-c610-4d94-b33d-dfccd93c5405
18,methods12,"  Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet Adherence To assess change in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence, dietary intake was measured using the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour (ASA24) recall tool from the National Cancer Institute. The ASA24 is an automated tool that uses the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s validated multiple-pass method to elicit intake throughout a given day [26]. Using an unannounced protocol, participants were asked via email to complete 1 weekend day and 1 weekday of dietary intake within a 2-week period. The ASA24 provides comprehensive nutrient data on all foods and beverages consumed during the previous 24-hour period. These data were used to calculate a nutrient-based Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index score, developed by Mellen and colleagues [15], as mentioned above.",c1e551bb-3956-4b72-bcc6-d762cc9caa2c
19,methods13," Nutrient targets can be found in the “Change in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Adherence Across Arms” section and were standardized to total calorie intake. Individual nutrient scores were summed to calculate a total Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence score. As such, the score range is 0 to 9, with higher scores indicative of greater adherence and a score of 9 indicating full adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern.  Blood Pressure Participants confirmed that they had not consumed coffee or used tobacco 30 minutes before the blood pressure measurement. We standardized our procedures to use the right arm unless a participant indicated that it was medically contraindicated, and we measured arm circumference to determine blood pressure cuff size.",31d6dfee-c688-46ba-818b-be54793205d5
20,methods14," After resting for 5 minutes, blood pressure was measured 3 times with 30-second intervals in between each measurement using a blood pressure monitor (HEM-907XL; Omron Healthcare). Using the average blood pressure measurement, we categorized participants based on their severity of hypertension [3].  Intervention Satisfaction At 3 months, using surveys adapted from our previous studies, we assessed perceived ease and usefulness of the Nutritionix app across both study arms and overall satisfaction with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud intervention within the intervention arm only.",da9a61b1-7afb-4c3c-93e8-4696bdeece04
21,methods15," Using a 5-point Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree, we asked participants about their perceptions of all elements of the intervention, including the ease and usefulness of the Nutritionix app, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score in the feedback, the personalization of the texts, the timing of the texts, and whether an individual would recommend this program to others. The “Satisfaction With Intervention Activities” section describes the intervention satisfaction questions we asked the intervention arm only and the proportion that responded in agreement.  Analysis For descriptive analyses, normally distributed variables were summarized and reported as means and standard deviations. Engagement was analyzed using a 2-tailed t test to compare overall mean engagement over the course of the study. Engagement trends over time were analyzed using a random-intercept mixed model with unstructured covariance.",dc94c74f-a098-42d9-bcd8-2a7d2cc39d3c
22,methods16," The model included a continuous variable for time in weeks, a treatment group variable, and a time-by-group interaction term. To assess changes in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence score, we conducted a primary analysis that treated invalid baseline and 3-month data as missing. Using standard protocols for obtaining valid dietary intake [23], we defined invalid assessments as those having a mean daily caloric intake of <600 or >3500 calories or those that did not include at least 2 recalls from 1 weekend day and 1 weekday or that included recalls that were collected more than 2 weeks apart.",80e340a7-b179-475b-aef9-e1d1a49b8b37
23,methods17," To examine the effect of the treatment group over time on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence, controlling for baseline levels of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence, we conducted linear regression models assessing 3-month Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) component values by study arm and including baseline Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence as a covariate. Within-group changes in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and components were estimated using repeated-measures analysis of variance methods. Sensitivity analysis models were conducted using the same methods while including measurements previously excluded as invalid in the per-protocol models. Between-group differences in 3-month systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also assessed using linear regression models and adjusting for baseline values.",cef8d697-b2f5-4267-b0f0-6c106cb5b255
24,methods18, Missing 3-month values in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and blood pressure models were addressed using intent-to-treat principles with maximum likelihood estimations. Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute) software and P values with an α <.05 were considered statistically significant. ,fd6fe5f1-72e8-4cab-875d-f23b5ec8b510
25,results0,"Recruitment and Retention Rates The recruitment period lasted from July 21, 2017, to November 5, 2017. The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) diagram (Figure 2) shows the study flow for both recruitment and retention; 422 individuals filled out the screening on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud website, and 363 of those individuals were ineligible, declined participation, or did not complete baseline activities. The primary reason for ineligibility was not meeting the blood pressure criteria. Of the remaining eligible participants, 59 were then randomized to receive the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud intervention (n=30) or the active comparator arm (n=29). At the end of the study, 90% (28/30 intervention, 25/29 control) of participants attended the final 3-month visit.

The majority of participants (41/59, 69%) were classified as having elevated blood pressure according to updated blood pressure guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, which is defined as any measurement of systolic blood pressure over 120 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure measurement over 80 mmHg. These updated guidelines have lowered the threshold for elevated blood pressure, and lifestyle treatments, such as Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), are a first line of treatment for those meeting these criteria.

Figure 3 Predicted mean days of diet tracking over time by study arm.  Change in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Adherence Across Arms As is shown in Table 2, the mean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score at baseline was 2.2 (SD 1.3), and there were no significant differences across study arms (2.2, SD 1.3 in intervention vs 2.4, SD 1.3 in active comparator; P=.85). After we adjusted for baseline Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores, participants in the intervention arm had Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores that were 0.01 (95% CI –0.7 to 0.7) points lower than the active comparator arm at 3 months (P=.97).",99ef8adc-c5cb-43a7-a0ef-d65d928e5072

33,results10,"  Change in Blood Pressure Across Arms After adjusting for baseline, participants in the intervention arm had systolic blood pressures that were, on average, 2.8 (95% CI –1.8 to 7.4) mmHg lower than the active comparator arm at 3 months, though not significantly (P=.23). Participants’ 3-month average diastolic blood pressure was lower in the intervention arm, on average, by 3.6 (95% CI –0.2 to 7.3) mmHg compared with the active comparator arm after adjusting for baseline, though not significantly (P=.07).  Association Between Change in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Adherence and Change in Blood Pressure Overall, changes in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and changes in blood pressure were inversely correlated. A 1-unit improvement in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was associated with a 2.5 (95% CI 0.5 to 4.5) mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure (r=–0.34; P=.02) and a 1.6 (95% CI 0.05 to 3.",a5d249b1-9af9-47b2-9b13-4c4c6c5f9439

The association in the active comparator group was slightly weaker, with a 1.7 (95% CI –2.1 to 5.4) mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure (r=–0.20; P=.37) and a 1.8 (95% CI –0.8 to 4.4) mmHg decrease in diastolic blood pressure (r=–0.29; P=.16) per unit of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score improvement.

39,discussion0,"Principal Findings Adoption of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern can help with blood pressure reduction for the 100 million Americans with suboptimal blood pressure [3]. This study aimed to develop and test the feasibility of using a digital health tool that leverages smartphone diet-tracking apps to improve population-level adoption of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). We found that it was feasible to use a commercially available diet-tracking app in our intervention platform and add a behavioral intervention aimed at improving Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence. We were successful at recruiting and retaining women with high blood pressure and achieved moderate to high rates of engagement with diet tracking across both study arms. Similarly, both study arms saw a small increase in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence at 3 months.",62de8775-637f-4ad0-8505-67c86d405511
40,discussion1," However, we found that adding a digital behavioral Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) intervention to a diet-tracking app did not increase Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence compared to diet tracking alone.  These findings are notable for various reasons. First, they signal that participants can achieve and sustain moderate to high engagement with diet-tracking apps even if no feedback is provided on app entries and that these apps can be used to improve their behavioral efficacy. Studies that have examined diet-tracking engagement without added behavioral intervention components demonstrated lower rates of tracking than the average of 4 days per week that we found in this study. In a study by Laing and colleagues [27], rates of diet tracking using the popular app My Fitness Pal dropped significantly after the first month. Patel and colleagues [28] found a similar steep decline in diet tracking after the first month.",8a5c9ff3-fb9d-49bc-86b4-379edc0697e9
41,discussion2," It may be that our focus on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) rather than fitness or weight control motivated all participants regardless of whether they received feedback to engage more frequently.  Second, these findings also signal that any feedback is not always better than no feedback for improving engagement and overall dietary quality, with the caveat that we were not powered to evaluate those differences statistically. Behavior change theories and relevant empirical studies support that giving feedback, particularly tailored feedback, can improve engagement and subsequent behavior change [29,30]. However, the structure of the feedback, the level of personalization, and the relevancy of the feedback are important. Given the study design, we cannot know for sure why the intervention group tracked their diet less often as a result of the feedback; responses to the intervention satisfaction questionnaire give us some insight.",e341d700-56ba-4baa-a18d-19c265ddfa56
42,discussion3," Most notable is that less than half of participants found the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score used in the feedback motivating and reflective of what they ate. This finding does not preclude the use of “summary type” scoring feedback for improving dietary intake; rather, this suggests that we need to reconsider how to make it more helpful and interpretable to individuals. Additionally, as in any technology, we experienced bugs or issues with coding that did not line up with the logic outlined in the feedback algorithm. We aimed to test for these bugs before and during the execution of the intervention. However, it is possible that the presence of bugs could have impacted intervention engagement and perceptions about helpfulness of the feedback messages. We did not measure this in the study, so we are not able to quantitatively or qualitatively indicate how often this occurred or how much impact any bugs had on outcomes.",6bf075d4-12d5-4789-987e-124d0a9c6746
43,discussion4," Future studies should aim to consider measuring the impact of these bugs on outcomes.  Additionally, many participants stated that achieving full Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence was difficult. Given this perception, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score may not have provided positive reinforcement to support dietary behavior change. We are not aware of other studies that gave feedback on nutrients to improve diet quality, and we decided to use nutrient intake as part of the feedback because of its clear link to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence and the subsequent benefits on blood pressure. Participants may prefer feedback on adherence using food groups or some other measure of adherence.",2bf3c6bb-34cd-4620-bfb1-979f8bdb81f8
44,discussion5," Overall, it would have been helpful to conduct a formal qualitative study after the intervention to better understand the discrepancies between the groups in engagement outcomes and determine how we could have improved satisfaction and perceptions of ease and helpfulness of the intervention. Future studies testing the feasibility of digital health interventions such as Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud should consider how best to understand the factors that will improve sustained engagement. We did not include a coach or any human support, and it may be that to change dietary behaviors, additional supports are needed beyond what can be provided via technology alone.  Third, these findings indicate that we may need to reconsider how to best provide personalized feedback to improve overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence.",6b337ec1-4724-4117-8e18-8a24604e7781
45,discussion6," Only 28% (8/29) of participants said they felt the texts were personalized, despite the use of an algorithm designed to personalize messages about intake of specific Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) nutrients. Our understanding of the most effective formula for personalizing feedback is mixed, but many studies support that personalizing interventions and feedback improves engagement [29,30]. We suggest that the personalization also reflect individual circumstances (eg, including feedback tips specific to one’s family structure) and attitudes and beliefs (eg, self-efficacy for changing behavior) and how those characteristics then impact the individual’s dietary behaviors. Future studies should work toward testing these different approaches when personalizing feedback. Despite the low ratings for the use of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and the personalization of the texts, 79% (23/29) of participants said they would recommend this program.",28df9f9e-c65a-4617-b537-bf10aa13d418
46,discussion7, This suggests that the overall concept of using diet-tracking apps to promote adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is appealing.  The high rating of the program overall is important because of the substantial need to improve population-level adoption of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). Mellen and colleagues [15] used population-level data to assess Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence shortly before and after the integration of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) into national dietary guidelines. They found that less than 1% of the population is fully adherent to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and only 20% meet half of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) recommendations [15]. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence remained poor in subsequent cross-sectional population cohort studies [9].,72949d5c-899c-4ec3-a7dd-792ddabed85f
47,discussion8," As is supported by the current study, it may be that full Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence is difficult to achieve. Indeed, trials testing intensive behavioral interventions to promote Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) have also struggled to help individuals achieve full adherence [31,32]. The PREMIER trial [33,34] was a comprehensive, multicomponent, behavioral intervention to improve adoption of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). The PREMIER intervention included standard behavior change components delivered via frequent face-to-face counseling with a registered dietitian and group meetings [33,34]. This high-intensity approach was effective in improving Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence, but not full adoption of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) [32]. This intervention also included other behavioral components, including sodium reduction, increased physical activity, and weight loss.",ed49b210-22dc-43e2-972f-033fbd547463
48,discussion9," Although comprehensive, focusing on multiple behaviors at a given time may have made it more difficult to fully adopt all Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) recommendations. Similarly, the ENCORE (Exercise and Nutritional Interventions for Cardiovascular Health) trial tested a comprehensive behavioral approach to adopting Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), assessing the comparative efficacy of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) plus behaviors for weight management on changes in blood pressure [35]. They found that both groups doubled their Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence score, but the average score post intervention remained suboptimal [31]. Notably, the ENCORE trial found a linear relationship between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence and change in blood pressure.",33eed439-1582-40f9-b082-ce783631ff7b
49,discussion10," Full Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence may be optimal, but partial adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) can be effective for lowering blood pressure [31].  The intensive intervention approaches tested in both PREMIER and ENCORE were effective in improving the adoption of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) to clinically meaningful levels, but these approaches are not accessible to the broader population. To our knowledge, this was one of the first studies to test the feasibility of using mobile technologies and smartphone apps to disseminate and improve the adoption of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH).",f3b099fb-1977-4e3c-be9d-8cd664a59e29
50,discussion11," Mann and colleagues [36] developed a similar intervention called Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Mobile that consisted of easy tracking of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) food portions; integrated Bluetooth blood pressure, weight, and pedometer monitoring; goal setting; simple data visualizations; and multimedia video clips to train patients in the basic concepts of the lifestyle change plan. This intervention has some notable distinctions from the current study. First, the intervention included more than just diet tracking and text message feedback and videos. It included other behavioral goals and behaviors to track, as well as the use of a coach to support behavior change efforts. Second, the research team developed the app rather than using commercially available ones to start.",e553101e-dbd0-4adc-b331-dd3035b86c00
51,discussion12," As such, it went through prototype testing and the researchers had to consider many elements of user design that for many commercially available apps have already been considered. Mann and colleagues [36] discuss lessons learned in the development of their Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Mobile platform that are important for others looking to develop digital health programs to increase adoption of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). Our findings add to that evidence base but suggest that a lower-intensity approach improves Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adoption only slightly. To truly extend the reach of evidence-based behavioral interventions to disseminate Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), we need to continue to test ways to replicate what was done in PREMIER and ENCORE while maintaining the potential for dissemination we aimed for in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud.",a888cd0f-a324-4aa6-b01c-77ca7d19fd46
52,discussion13,"  Strengths and Limitations Strengths of this study included the purposeful choice to use commercial apps in the intervention platform. This choice allows for more flexibility in future studies and increases the potential that this platform could be adapted for other technologies or outcomes. For example, if a new technology is developed that uses a different tool for tracking diet (eg, voice-assisted tracking), the intervention could be easily implemented with that new technology. This design choice increases the potential for dissemination. The use of a randomized controlled design allowed us to isolate the feasibility of the feedback and disentangle the effects of the tracking. Our results provide good insight about how feedback may not always improve engagement with diet tracking. Further, we achieved strong recruitment and retention rates, which supports the feasibility of this approach.  Despite these strengths, there are several limitations worth noting.",57e09c7c-27ce-470b-9a16-87f17d0b1651
53,discussion14," This was a feasibility trial with a small sample size, so it is difficult to interpret the findings of this study because it was not powered to show an effect on changes in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence, engagement, or blood pressure. The primary focus was to assess the feasibility of developing the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud platform by examining recruitment and retention rates and engagement with intervention activities, then exploring the effects of the intervention on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet adherence and changes in blood pressure. As such, we did not conduct any power analyses. This is consistent with guidelines from Leon et al [21], which state that conducting power analyses is not needed when testing for feasibility. We also did not limit our study sample to only participants with hypertension or participants not taking hypertension medications. This was purposeful, given the focus on feasibility.",a45908a9-2e8d-4486-b0fb-369a3e18205c
54,discussion15," However, this may have attenuated any differential effects on change in blood pressure. A common limitation of dietary studies is that the accuracy of the data collected is subject to potential recall and response biases [25,26]. Since participants were aware that their diet data would be collected, it may have led them to overestimate or underestimate dietary intake. Similarly, since we operationalized engagement using a valid day of tracking based on caloric intake, there may have been nondifferential misclassification of participants. Participants may have logged one meal or one food item to reach this threshold. Furthermore, the results of this study are not generalizable beyond the study population, which included mostly non-Hispanic White, educated women. The focus on recruiting only women was to better understand ways to reduce women’s disproportionate cardiovascular risk using lifestyle approaches to blood pressure management.",b5851963-8cd0-4b64-979e-8213d2dfab61
55,discussion16,"  Conclusion and Future Directions We developed a digital program, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Cloud, that leverages commercially available diet-tracking apps that millions of Americans are using. In the current feasibility study, we found moderate to high engagement with diet tracking, an important predictor of successful behavior changes. However, this study also provided insights into the manner and type of feedback that should be given to participants using these diet-tracking apps. We need to better understand how to provide both personalized and relevant feedback to improve the uptake of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). To truly impact population health, we need to continually think not just about what best promotes the adoption of a healthy diet but also how to best disseminate and extend the reach of evidence-based treatments like the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern.",03ed2489-f319-4305-99b6-6e870737f84d
