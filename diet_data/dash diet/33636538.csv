0,background0," Globally, hypertension is a major public health problem and a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease complications. To reduce and prevent complications from hypertension, it is important to adapt self-care behaviors. This study aimed to assess the self-care practices of adult hypertensive patients at a tertiary teaching hospital in Ethiopia. ",74351bc5-b6c0-4f48-bea2-518bde3aa26a
1,methods0," Study setting  The current project was conducted at Jimma Medical Center in Ethiopia. Jimma Medical Center (Jimma Medical Center (JMC)) is one of the oldest public hospitals in the country. Geographically, it is located in Jimma city 352 km southwest of Addis Ababa, the capital. With a bed size of 800, Jimma Medical Center (JMC) is the only teaching and tertiary hospital in the southwestern part of the country. It provides services for approximately 15,000 inpatients, 160,000 outpatient attendants, 11,000 emergency cases, and 4500 deliveries per year coming to the hospital from the catchment population of about 20 million people. The medical center has over 1500 health workers. Besides serving as a referral center, the hospital serves as a teaching and research center for several health professionals at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.",e7145061-daef-45f2-ae7f-e39ded2599dc
2,methods1," The hospital has different general departments and specialty units like surgery, pediatrics and child health, internal medicine, oncology, gynecology-obstetrics, ophthalmology, dentistry, and other subspecialty clinics. The hospital provides screening and treatment services for people living with chronic disease at different specific ambulatory clinics.  Study design and period  A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2021 to July 2021.  Study population  The study population for the current study was all adult hypertensive patients on follow-up at the ambulatory clinic of Jimma Medical Center (JMC) during the study period and fulfills the inclusion criteria.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria  All adult hypertensive patients aged 18 years and above on follow-up for greater than 3 months were included in the study. We excluded patients who were seriously ill and unable to respond to interviews during the data collection period.",fc1e439a-273d-4103-b379-cfaeccd59001
3,methods2,"  Sample size determination and sampling procedure  The sample size was determined using a single population proportion formula based on the following assumptions: considering 95% of confidence level, 5% margin of error, and 51% prevalence of poor self-care practice [30]. A minimum sample size was 384. Considering a 10% non-response rate, we recruited a total of 422 study participants consecutively over the study period. Participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique.  Data collection tools and methods  Pretested structured questionnaires adapted from validated scales, published articles [30–34], and modified to the context of the study were used to collect data from participants. The tool contains socio-demographic information, clinical profile of patient, Self-efficacy measure, Social support, self-care practices, knowledge and attitude related information, and questions. Data were collected by the interviewer-administered questionnaire.",4f4375b6-1db1-4e36-99d6-445f4ac910f8
4,methods3," Data were collected by three trained nurses with a Bachelor of Science degree. Blood pressure was considered when an average systolic BP > 130 and diastolic BP > 80 mmHg for at least three consecutive follow-up appointments in patients younger than 60 years old [35].  Outcome measures and validating methods  A	Self-efficacy	The patient’s self-efficacy is confidence in his or her ability to perform tasks. It is drawn from a five-item scale. Feedback options range from 0 (completely not confident) to 5 (completely confident). Respondents who scored 4 or higher were classified as having good self-efficacy, and if they scored below 4, it was considered poor self-efficacy [34]	 B	Social support	Social support is when the patient has friends and others, including family, present in times of need or crisis to give them a bigger picture and a positive image of themselves.",00d79397-2213-4c83-8e94-414375380543
5,methods4," The Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale (MStatistical Package for social science (SPSS)) was used to measure social support. The MStatistical Package for social science (SPSS) is a 12-item measure that rates the adequacy of social support on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree. Total score from 12 to 84; with scores higher and equal to 64 indicates better (good) social support [36]	 C	Self-care practice	Self-care practice was assessed using the impact of hypertension-related self-care activity level [29]. The H-SCALE is a self-report questionnaire that includes six categories of self-care behaviors, which include medication adherence, a low-salt diet, physical activity, smoking cessation, weight management, and abstinence from alcohol.",f49aed4f-6137-40d9-82b2-ddd7503e34ce
6,methods5, Good self-care practices are considered when the patient scores average or higher on the H-SCALE questions	 D	Medication adherence	Three items were used to evaluate adherence to the prescribed medication. Then add the answer to each item with a score range of 0 to 21. Participants scoring 21 points are considered adherent [37]	 E	Blood pressure (BP) monitoring	Good blood pressure monitoring was considered when BP was measured one time per month and more than once per month for uncontrolled BP [38]	 F	Diet quality	Diet quality was assessed based on the 11-item Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension Quality (dietary approach for stopping hypertension (DASH)-Q) scale. These factors allow us to evaluate healthy food intake related to the nutritional content of the dietary approach for stopping hypertension (DASH) diet. Responses were summarized and ranged from 0 to 77. A score of fewer than 32 was considered poor diet quality.,31b2177e-e80d-42a7-b13b-5caff7282091
7,methods6," A score of 33–51 corresponds to the average quality of the diet and a score of 52 or higher corresponds to good diet quality [39]	 G	Physical activity	Physical activity was assessed on two items and summarized responses on ranges from 0 to 14 score. Participants with a score of 8 or higher were considered to comply with the physical activity recommendations [40, 41]	 H	Weight management	The patient’s weight management over the past 30 days was rated on a 10-item scale. Response categories range from strongly disagree [1] to strongly agree [5]. Summarize the responses to calculate a score in the 10–50 range. Participants reporting a score of 40 or higher were considered adherent to good weight management practices [33, 42]	 I	Alcohol intake	The amount of alcohol consumed was evaluated on a 3-item scale.",5048b266-21ba-4658-b04c-66fc02a5d080
8,methods7," The participant who stated that they did not drink alcohol at all in the last 7 days, or generally did not drink alcohol at all, are considered abstainers [43]	 J	Knowledge	Hypertension evaluation of lifestyle and management (Hypertension evaluation of lifestyle and management (HELM)) scale was used to assess the knowledge of respondents. If a participant answers above the median knowledge question, it is considered “knowledgeable” or good knowledge [32]	 K	Attitude	A “favorable attitude” is considered when a patient answers a question about attitude with an average or higher score	  Data processing and analysis  Data were entered into epi info and exported to the Statistical Package for Social Science (Statistical Package for social science (SPSS)) version 22.0 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis of patient characteristics.",f1bc29a5-0f33-4afe-90fd-13519c4ce9db
9,methods8," Chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis were done to determine the presence of a statistically significant association between explanatory variables and the outcome variable. Factors associated with self-care practices were identified using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Before analysis factors such as independence of errors, linearity in the logit for continuous variables, multicollinearity, and outliers were checked. Odds Ratio (OR), p-value, and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated, and the result was considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.  Data quality management  The quality of the data was ensured through the development of appropriate data collection materials. Two-day training on study objectives, data retrieval, and the collection was given for the data collectors. Overall activity was monitored by the study's lead investigator.",556cf884-e79e-4300-a924-0ba4e7c171ed

17,discussion0," Self-management is an important non-pharmacological approach that facilitates blood pressure control. It is essential for the prevention and treatment of hypertension [44]. This study aimed to determine the level of self-care in hypertensive patients in relation to antihypertensive drug compliance and therapeutic lifestyle changes. The overall level of self-care practice in this study was 53.1% (49.37%, 57.13%). This is consistent with a study in Nigeria [45] (47.4%) and a previous study conducted in a research setting [46] (55.3%). However, the result of this study was lower than the results of studies conducted in Addis Ababa [20] (77%), Durame [27] (72.7%), and MizanTepi [47]. Meanwhile, the result of this study was higher than those of studies conducted not only in Iran [48] (27%), but also in Harar [49] (37.9%) and Nekemte [50] (31.1%).",e5cba8bc-047c-4fc5-8396-7c48d4a05a95
18,discussion1," These discrepancies may relate to differences in the population's lifestyle, cultural, economic situation, access to health care facilities, and educational attainment.  In this study, the rate of using a low-quality diet was 78% (69.66%, 84.47%). This result is higher than studies conducted in Durame [27], (42.5%) [27], Harar [49], (18.2%) [43], Saudi Arabia [45] (20.7%) [45] and Uganda [51] (24.4%). This may be due to differences in dietary perceptions on dietary management by region and country. In addition, differences in measurement tools, socio-economic and socio-cultural values may cause fluctuations in results.  In this study, non-adherence to physical activity was 75.1% (68.77%, 88.90%). This is consistent with a study done in Durame [27] (83.9%) and Saudi [52] (76.8%).

19,discussion2,"6%) This may be due to limited facilities or the lack of a structural framework for exercise around the workplace as well as for the general public in the study area. In addition, patients' perceptions and attitudes toward physical activity may limit its practice.  The smoking rate in this study was 6.4%. This finding was lower than other studies done in Ethiopia [27, 49], India [54], Kenya [55] Nigeria [56, 57], Canada [58], Korea [59], and Iran [60]. In addition, the prevalence of alcohol use in this study was 15.2%. This was in line with other studies in Ethiopia [25, 27], Ghana [61], Kenya [55]. However, this result was much lower than studies conducted in other regions of Nigeria [56, 57] and Korea [59]. Differences in survey results may be related to differences in socio-cultural and religious viewpoints. Smoking and drinking within the community are not encouraged in this area of study.",588dd675-28c1-433c-8d7a-721bc4921b71
20,discussion3,"  Educational level showed a statistically significant relationship with self-management practice. Patients who cannot read and write were twice more likely to have poor self-care than patients with higher education. This was in line with the other studies done in Ethiopia [27, 62]. This may be due to cognitive differences between patients with formal education and those without formal education. Patients who cannot read and write overlook sources of information such as posters, flyers, and other written materials.  The probability of poor self-care practice was higher and statistically significant among patients with chronic disease co-morbidity. This finding was consistent with the other studies from Ethiopian settings [27, 53, 63]. This may be due to symptoms of co-morbidity that interfere with self-management of high blood pressure, or lifestyle changes caused by the co-morbidity.",3ee4fe57-b9ea-47a3-9204-8b03b408327b
21,discussion4," In addition, comorbid conditions exacerbate the patient's symptoms and prevent them from adapting to lifestyle changes [64].  In this study, people with uncontrolled blood pressure were twice as likely to be poorly self-managing as those with controlled blood pressure. This was in line with other studies [49, 62, 65, 66]. This may be due to the fact that good self-care habits can help control blood pressure.  This study also showed the impact of social support on self-management practices in patients with arterial hypertension. Patients with poor social support were nearly three times more likely to have poor self-management than patients with good social support. This was consistent with other studies [25, 53, 67]. This can be attributed to several aspects, of social support in stress management, and psychoactive self-help activities, that positively impact patients’ lifestyle changes.",4a41e9b8-8338-4e8e-97bb-728c286f6b2b
22,discussion5," This study also showed a statistically significant relationship between attitudes toward hypertension and self-management practices. Patients with unfavorable were three times more likely to have poor self-care than patients with positive attitudes. This may be because hypertensive patients understand the complications of the disease and can engage in effective self-management to prevent these complications.  Limitation of the study  As this is a one-hospital study, it will be difficult to generalize. Because the study participants’ self-management practices were based on self-report, there may be memory bias and social desirability bias.  Conclusion  The level of self-care practices for hypertension in the study area was low. In particular, the level of adherence to the dietary approach for stopping hypertension (DASH) diet, exercise, and weight control was very low.",078d52c7-9142-45ce-8fe5-425d7cbc62c4
