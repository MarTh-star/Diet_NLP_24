0,methods0," Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants from 1999 to 2010, including their vital status linked to the National Death Index through the end of 2011, were analyzed. Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet was assessed using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and the alternative Mediterranean Diet Index (aMED), respectively. Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to compare the hazard ratios for the associations of adherence (diet score >median vs. ≤ median) to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet with all-cause mortality.   Study Population  The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) consists of a series of cross-sectional examinations conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics.",50ea3d04-fa79-4d4d-859a-ac06fbf16ab1
1,methods1," Participants were assessed for their health and nutritional status through anthropometric data collection, laboratory tests, and questionnaires. All participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) provided informed consent. The dietary patterns of the participants were assessed using information from the dietary interview questionnaires (24 h dietary recalls). A second day of 24-h dietary recalls through telephone calls was conducted since 2003. For consistency, we used only the information from the single 24-h dietary recalls for analyses. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Our study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan (approval number: CE18312A).

2,methods2," After excluding participants aged ≤ 18 years and those with missing information related to nutrient intakes, laboratory data, history of diabetes, and survival status, a total of 28,905 participants were analyzed (Figure 1).  Figure 1 Flow diagram displaying the selection of study participants for analyses.  Information on Variables for Analyses  Participants were classified as having diabetes if they reported (1) having a history of diabetes, or (2) receiving treatment with oral glucose lowering drugs or insulin, or had a fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl or a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5% (23). Among participants with no diabetes, those who had a fasting plasma glucose 100–125 mg/dl or an HbA1c 5.7–6.4% were classified as having prediabetes (23). Participants who did not fulfill the aforementioned criteria were classified as having normal glucose tolerance.",2cf89b14-bd94-40d5-8973-657c2b3d5fb3
3,methods3," Kidney function was assessed using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) determined with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (24). Chronic kidney disease was defied as having an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Daily calories consumption and the proportion of energy from carbohydrate, fat, and protein were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, history of hypertension, smoking, lipids profile, kidney function, and daily calories were compared across the three glucose regulation states, and were adjusted in the analytic models. The vital status of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants was confirmed by linking to the National Death Index up to the end of 2011.",850eb921-cbab-44ea-b8dd-c2eed68a4361
4,methods4,"  Assessment of Dietary Scores  Nutrient intakes of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants were assessed using information from the dietary interview questionnaires (24-h dietary recall). A detailed description is available online (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Dietary&CycleBeginYear=2005). We assessed our study population's adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (9) and the aMED (16, 17), respectively, both of which had been applied to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants (9, 17, 21, 25). The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was determined based on 9 target nutrients (saturated fat, total fat, protein, cholesterol, fiber, magnesium, calcium, potassium, and sodium) (9).",c4f03946-d945-4e4a-a98c-7b2ec19e32ee
5,methods5," For each target nutrient, participants whose intake met the goal were given 1 point, while those who met the intermediate goal were given 0.5 point (maximum score = 9) (9, 10). The aMED was determined with assessments of intakes from alcohol, red and processed meat, sea food, whole grains, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables (except potatoes), and ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat (16, 17). Participants whose intake was greater than the median of population intake of sea food, whole grains, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables (except potatoes), and ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat were given 1 point (16, 17). For red/processed meat and alcohol, one point was assigned to those who had meat intake less than the median or moderate alcohol intake (10–25 g/day for men and 5–15 g/day for women). Participants received 0 points if the aforementioned criteria were not met (maximum score = 9).",cb27421c-5c40-40fd-8276-3bc74f2f9c66
6,methods6," The higher the diet scores (the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and the aMED), the better the concordance with the respective dietary pattern.  Outcomes of Interest  The primary outcome in this study was all-cause mortality. All deaths after 1998 were coded following the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death (ICD-10) guidelines, and were categorized into cause-specific mortality (such as CV and cancer mortality) (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr143-508.pdf). Identifying information of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants (e.g., Social Security Number, sex, date of birth, last name, first name, …etc) were matched with the National Death Index. Participants who did not meet minimum data requirement for matching were ineligible for record linkage, and were excluded from the study population (missing information on survival status, Figure 1).",7c42c155-300b-4971-9c17-5667ae6d4d4a
7,methods7," All participants were divided into different groups according to the median of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and the aMED to determine whether a better adherence to the dietary pattern (>median vs. ≤ median) was associated with a lower risk of all-cause and CV mortality. We also conducted analyses in subgroups with different glucose regulation status (normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes, and diabetes).  Statistical Analyses  All of the statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical Analysis System survey procedures (SAS version 9.4, 2013, Cary, NC, USA). The Chi-square test and the independent sample t-test were used to determine the statistical significance of the between-group differences in categorical and continuous variables, respectively. All analyses were adequately weighted according to the analytic guidelines (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx).",9d7f05c9-6086-40ac-b4fe-bd40dd223459
8,methods8," To compare the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI for the associations of adherence (diet score >median vs. ≤ median) to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet with all-cause mortality, weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models (proc surveyphreg; SAS version 9.4, 2013, Cary, NC, USA) were used with adjustment for age, sex, race, body mass index, history of hypertension, smoking, total cholesterol, chronic kidney disease, and daily energy intake. The analyses were also conducted in study participants with different glucose regulation states. In addition, joint effects of adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diet were tested in the overall population as well as in participants with different glucose regulation states.",2081a68b-e6c4-4e14-9e9e-e3c45180966e
9,methods9," Finally, the associations of each component of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and the aMED with all-cause mortality were examined in participants with or without diabetes. In all of the statistical analyses, a two-sided p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. ",dd05a310-f428-44dd-ab59-30d06ec4ac6c
10,results0," The characteristics of study participants according to their glucose regulation status are shown in Table 1. Participants with diabetes were older, had a higher body mass index and systolic blood pressure, had a higher proportion of having hypertension, were less likely to smoke, had lower high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and higher triglyceride, and had lower eGFR and daily calorie intake compared with participants with normal glucose tolerance or prediabetes.

The risk of all-cause mortality was higher in participants with diabetes (27.8 per 1,000 person-years) and prediabetes (15.3 per 1,000 person-years), compared with those who had normal glucose tolerance (5.9 per 1,000 person-years). Overall, adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score >2 vs. ≤ 2) was not associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82–1.05, p = 0.215, Table 3). In contrast, adherence to the Mediterranean diet (aMED >3 vs. ≤ 3) was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66–0.83, p < 0.001, Table 3).

15,results11," In general, diabetes was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with no diabetes (score = 0 with diabetes vs. score = 0 with no diabetes [the reference group]). Examining each component of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (Table 5), adequate fiber (adjusted HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56–0.88, p = 0.003), magnesium (adjusted HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58–0.93, p = 0.001), or potassium (adjusted HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67–1.03, p = 0.087) intake was associated with a lower risk of mortality in participants with no diabetes (score = 1 with no diabetes vs. the reference group).

16,discussion0," In this study, we investigated the associations of adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet with all-cause mortality in people with different glucose regulation states. We demonstrated that better adherence to the Mediterranean diet (aMED >3 vs. ≤ 3), but not the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score >2 vs. ≤ 2), was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants (Table 3). A joint effect of adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet was noted in people with diabetes (Table 4). Our findings suggest that adherence to the Mediterranean diet (aMED > median) was associated with a lower risk of mortality in a general population.",dafc1e58-2da2-48d7-a000-5d9b47d1350f
17,discussion1," For people with diabetes, a lower risk of mortality was noted in those who had a dietary pattern concordant with both the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score >median and aMED >median).  Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (10–12, 26) and the Mediterranean diet (18, 19, 27, 28) has been associated with reduced risk of mortality, although the results are inconsistent. For example, adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet in adults with hypertension (10) has been associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. However, there was no significant association between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and risk of all-cause mortality in a general population (21).",4dafa322-741c-4707-bf5b-16676916f703
18,discussion2," The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, initially proposed in the 1990s to help treat hypertension (6, 7), was effective for blood pressure reduction (6–8). A recent meta-analysis (26) reported that adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. However, some researchers suggested that strict adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet might be necessary to attain a survival benefit (29). Unfortunately, concordance with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was not good enough in the general population (median Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score = 3) (21), even in patients with hypertension (mean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score = 2.9) (9).",6800b62a-9c28-41f1-9225-880fe9d58682
19,discussion3," Overall low concordance with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (median Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score = 2) in the study population might help explain the null effect on all-cause mortality in our results. We stratified our study participants into three groups by their Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores (<2 [the reference group], 2–5, ≥ 5), and we observed that the adjusted HR [95% CI] for all-cause mortality were 1 (ref), 0.92 [0.80–1.05], and 0.80 [0.62–1.03], respectively (data not shown in Results). We speculate that maintenance of high concordance with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is important in order to obtain a beneficial effect on outcomes (29).  In contrast, adherence to the Mediterranean diet (aMED >3 vs. ≤ 3) was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants.",79a11d5e-3e3e-49ee-af0d-b5d34d033abe
20,discussion4," This finding was consistent across the three glucose regulation states, although there was only a modest decrease in participants with diabetes (p = 0.092, p for interaction = 0.777, Table 3). It is interesting to note that the effect of aMED >3 (vs. ≤ 3) on all-cause mortality in people with normal glucose tolerance or prediabetes was significant irrespective of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (>2 or ≤ 2) (Table 4). A joint effect was noted in people with diabetes, i.e., a lower risk of mortality was noted in those who had an aMED >3 and a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score >2. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been associated with improved survival (18, 19). Nevertheless, it is not yet clear whether the survival benefit is consistent across different glucose regulation states.",e95806f7-b7d2-4d9b-bd62-45d250ee7c1a
21,discussion5," Adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality risk in people with a metabolically healthy obese phenotype, but not in those with a metabolically unhealthy obese phenotype (30). In contrast, adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with a reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality in a metabolically unhealthy phenotype, but not in a metabolically healthy phenotype (31). These findings may help explain our results that a beneficial effect of aMED >3 in our participants with diabetes was noted in those who also had a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score >2 (Table 4).  We examined the associations of the individual components of the diet scores with all-cause mortality (Tables 5, 6).",7ba3c776-4a52-4d24-84fe-561165a3da03
22,discussion6," Among the components of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, an increase in fiber (32, 33), magnesium (34, 35), or potassium (36, 37) intake was associated with a reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality. It is interesting to note that a low-sodium intake (sodium score = 1, <2,400 mg/2,100 kcal diet) was associated with a higher risk of mortality in participants with or without diabetes (Table 5). A higher risk of all-cause mortality associated with low sodium excretion (approximately <4.0 g/day) has been reported (36, 37). The mean sodium intake in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants was around 3,500 mg/2,000 kcal (38). As sodium is an essential nutrient required for normal physiology, whether a low sodium intake (<2,400 mg/2,100 kcal diet) is appropriate for CV health warrants further investigation (39).",0b9970cc-fb6a-44db-8f58-27d854281a4f
23,discussion7," Regarding the components of aMED (Table 6), an increase in intake of whole grains (40–42), nuts (43–45), fruits (46–48), or vegetables (48, 49) was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality.  There were some limitations in this study. First, our analyses were based on information collected through a 24-h dietary recall interview with questionnaires. All dietary interviewers in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were required to complete a training course and to conduct supervised practice interviews before working independently to minimize data collection bias. Moreover, retraining sessions were conducted annually to reinforce the proper protocols. Thus, the quality of dietary information was satisfactory for research use. Nevertheless, long-term adherence to the dietary patterns was not addressed in this study. This issue should be taken into account when interpreting our results.",d654f56c-5ac9-4c77-83c6-c1068d4ae179
24,discussion8," Second, this was a cohort study and the between-group differences in baseline characteristics might have confounded our results. Ideally, the effect of a healthy dietary pattern on risk of mortality in patients with diabetes or prediabetes should be investigated in a randomized trial with long-term follow-up. Our findings provide novel insights into the nutritional recommendations for people with abnormal glucose regulation.  In conclusion, adherence to the Mediterranean diet (aMED > median) was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in a general population. For people with diabetes, the benefit was noted in those whose dietary pattern was concordant with both the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score >median and aMED >median).",a9274db0-4756-492d-8b0a-de28a4495480
