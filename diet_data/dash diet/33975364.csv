All participants provided written informed consent forms before recruitment. According to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the study procedures, purpose, and adverse events were explained to each participant (written and orally).  Participants, randomization, and allocation concealment  This randomized controlled trial was conducted in the framework of Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS)). The Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) is a large long-term community-based prospective study being conducted on a representative sample of residents from district No. 13 of Tehran, Iran. The population of this district represents the urban population of Tehran. The details of this study are described elsewhere [29].",67cef692-d40d-4ce7-89be-6e3b8ce5ea5f
3,methods3," Briefly, the first examination was initiated in March 1999. Using multistage stratified cluster random sampling, more than 15,000 individuals, aged ≥ 3 years, were enrolled. Overall, since 1999, the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) participants have undergone assessments for sociodemographic factors, lifestyle, medication use, socioeconomic status, anthropometric indices, and medical history of cardiovascular risk factors. The information is documented every three years in face-to-face visits by the local research team to update the previous data. Phases II, III, IV, V, and VI of this study were prospective follow-ups conducted during 2002–2004, 2005–2008, 2008–2011, 2012–2015, and 2016–2018, respectively.  Of 10,927 individuals participating in phase VI of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) study, TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotype was randomly determined in 8399 participants.",9fda9696-6b07-4e16-b227-a84f4f2fb147
4,methods4," Of these, 662 participants, aged 30–65 years, had type 2 diabetes with available information on TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotype (CC genotype, n = 240; TT genotype, n = 128, and CT genotype, n = 294). The criteria for diagnosing diabetes included a fasting plasma glucose (fasting plasma glucose (FPG)) level ≥ 126 mg/dL, two-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL, or using antihyperglycemic medications. Other inclusion criteria were being overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI): 25–40 kg/m2); no weight changes in the last three months before enrollment; consumption of red meat ≥ 1 serving/d; and willingness to consume legumes in the diet. On the other hand, participants with pregnancy or lactation, cardiac, hepatic, or renal impairment (creatinine ≥ 1.4 mg/dL in men and ≥ 1.3 mg/dL in women), and insulin use were excluded.  Randomization was carried out to generate the randomization sequence using the randomization website (www.randomization.com).",7825a93e-5179-41f0-8f3b-7308385b80ab
5,methods5," The randomization sequence was separately generated for participants with TCF7L2 rs7903146 risk allele (CT + TT) and non-risk allele (CC). Among participants eligible for this study, we selected 150 participants with genotype CC and 150 participants with genotype TT + CT and assigned them separately and randomly (1:1 ratio) to either the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet group or the legume-based dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet group. The recruitment of participants is shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1 Flowchart for the participants  The participants were randomly assigned to receive one of the two diets by a member of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) staff.

6,methods6,"  Blinding  In the nutritional interventions, blinding of the participants was practically impossible. However, the participants were unaware of their assignment to the intervention groups before enrolment. Individuals who assessed the outcomes, including laboratory technicians and staff members, were blind to the participants’ assignment, and dietary interventions were provided by a dietitian.  Dietary interventions  First, 307 individuals participated in a two-week run-in period when they consumed their usual diet while eliminating the legume intake. In the run-in period, seven participants were unwilling to continue the study and were excluded. At the end of the run-in period, 300 participants, stratified based on risk and non-risk alleles, were randomly assigned to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet group or legume-based dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet group over 16 weeks.",36012491-6a37-4827-8edc-e03c0830bdc5
7,methods7,"  The participants’ energy requirements were estimated from the resting energy expenditure, based on the Mifflin-St Jeor formula and multiplied by the physical activity coefficient [30]. Because the participants were overweight and obese, 500–700 kcal/d was deducted from their energy requirements. Based on each participant's energy requirement, the dietitian determined the diet, which contained approximately 25–30% fat, 15% protein, and 55–60% carbohydrate. In the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet group, the participants were instructed to follow the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet (2000–3000 kcal based on the participant’s energy requirement), composed of 8–12 servings/day of fruits and vegetables, 7–15 servings of whole grains, 2–3 servings of low-fat dairy products, two servings of red meat, one serving of nuts and seeds, and limited intake of sweets (five servings per week).",a86041b4-6698-4423-bb4d-4414298a64a6
8,methods8," The legume-based dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet was similar to the standard dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, with the exception that one serving of red meat was replaced with one serving of legumes at least five days a week. Also, because legumes are equivalent to one serving of whole grains, one serving of bread was also deducted from the legume-based dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet. In both diets, the participants were advised to consume less than or equal to one teaspoon of salt per day (2300 mg/d).  To evaluate the participants’ adherence to the interventions, the dietitian instructed them to record their daily dietary intake using a three-day food record (two weekdays and one weekend day) every weeks. The dietitian called the participants every week to gather their dietary information, compared their information with the instructed diet, and reinforced their diet adherence.",fd8e9c05-0d3b-4ea3-80b5-17df8c46648b
9,methods9," The intake of macro- and micronutrients was also calculated using NUTRITIONIST III Version 7.0 (N-Squared Computing, Salem, OR, USA), designed for Iranian foods. All participants were requested to maintain their physical activity and not to change their medications during the 16-week interventions unless prescribed by their physicians.  Primary and secondary outcomes  The primary outcome of this study was the difference in hs-CRP change from baseline to week 16 of follow-up between the groups. The secondary outcome was the difference in IL-6, TNF-α, and malondialdehyde (MDA) changes between the groups. Another secondary outcome was assessment of changes in the inflammatory markers, based on TCF7L2 rs7903146 risk allele (CT + TT) and non-risk allele (CC) separately.  Measurements  Weight was measured using a digital scale (Seca 707; range: 0–150 kg; Seca GmbH, Germany), with minimal clothing and without shoes; it was recorded to the nearest 100 g.",0ccb52f6-1c21-4154-8003-bbe327d0b34f
10,methods10," Height was also measured in a standing position, with shoulders in neutral alignment using a stadiometer (Seca 225; Seca GmbH, Germany) without shoes and recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm. The body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared.  At the beginning of the study and 16-week follow-up (between 7∶00 a.m. and 9∶00 a.m.), venous blood samples were collected from all participants who fasted for 12–14 h overnight. The blood samples were placed in vacutainer tubes, centrifuged within 30–45 min of collection, and stored in a − 80 °C freezer. The serum concentration of hs-CRP was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) kit (ZellBio, Germany). To analyze the concentrations of TNF-α and IL-6, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay was performed using a commercial kit (Diaclone, France).",5c8279e7-2950-4831-ac95-757707638d59

The intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) for the serum hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were 2.7%, 8.1%, 6.3%, and 3.3%, respectively.  Genomic DNA was extracted from the buffy coat of samples, using a standard salting out method with proteinase K. The quality of extracted DNA was determined using the NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer. Samples in the range of 1.7 < A260/A280 < 2 were excluded due to low quality and concentration.

22,discussion0," In this weight-loss interventional trial among individual with type 2 diabetes, the inflammatory and oxidative stress status improved by replacing one serving of red meat with legumes in the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet at least five days a week, regardless of having rs7903146 risk or non-risk allele.  Generally, low-grade inflammation occurs in the insulin resistance stage of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, identifying dietary determinants that increase inflammation and replacing them with dietary food groups that reduce inflammation are important. In many observational studies, but not all [9, 13], a positive association has been observed between biomarkers of inflammation and red meat consumption or red meat-rich dietary patterns [8, 10–12]. Also, substitution of a serving of total red meat with high-quality plant protein sources, such as legumes, was associated with lower CRP concentrations [8].",c6fd78a9-e066-46ad-9a66-8bb66c2db8f7
23,discussion1," However, there is no clear evidence on the effects of changes in red meat intake and replacement of red meat with other protein sources on inflammation biomarkers in dietary interventions. Although substituting carbohydrates with proteins in interventional studies has shown no effects on inflammatory markers [16, 17, 34, 35], the results related to the substitution of red meat with other protein sources are controversial. High-protein diets, both animal and plant proteins, have been suggested to reduce inflammatory markers [18]. In a previous study, although replacement of pork with chicken and red meat did not change the CRP concentration [36], partial replacement of red meat with plant proteins, such as soy protein and legumes, improved the inflammatory biomarkers [37, 38]. Moreover, replacement of red meat with 30 g of soy was adequate in reducing the concentration of inflammatory markers in postmenopausal women [38, 39].",70be1c1e-6213-4c57-adbc-cdb52357d59a
24,discussion2," In the current study, improvement of inflammatory markers was achieved by replacement of one serving of red meat with legumes at least five days a week; this finding is consistent with previous clinical trials and a systematic review and meta-analysis, documenting the health-promoting effects of legume intake, with a median intake of 63 g/d to 150 g (~ 1½ servings/d) [37, 40–42]. This effect might be due to the higher consumption of dietary fiber and low-glycemic-load carbohydrates in diets with high-quality plant protein sources.  The TCF7L2 rs7903146 SNP is the most important genetic predictor of T2DM [20]. Disturbances in insulin sensitivity and induction of insulin resistance are among the molecular mechanisms through which TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant increases the risk of T2DM [43]. Although the role of insulin resistance in inducing inflammation has been identified [25], the effect of TCF7L2 gene on inflammation has been less investigated [26, 27, 44].",d1dea332-6a88-4317-ba2f-225da0430178
25,discussion3," There was no significant difference in the inflammatory markers among TCF7L2 genotypes after treatment with fenofibrate [26]. Also, dietary patterns rich in functional foods did not modify the effects on CRP [28].  Although few studies have examined the modulatory effect of TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant on the relationship between diet and inflammation, some studies have reported that the detrimental effects of TCF7L2 gene on cardiometabolic risk factors may be improved by anti-inflammatory dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet [45, 46]. The dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is another anti-inflammatory diet.",cb71f64c-9807-4506-bef8-de8c4746a998
26,discussion4," Although the beneficial effect of dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet on the management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as inflammation, has been documented [47–49], to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet investigated the effect of interaction between the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and TCF7L2 gene on these risk factors.  Previous studies, however, have assessed the interaction between the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and some genes, such as genetic predisposition to obesity, based on body mass index (BMI)-associated variants [50, 51], as well as MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism [52] on cardiometabolic risk factors. In the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, during a 20-year follow-up, the effect of interaction between adherence to dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and genetic predisposition to obesity (based on 77 SNPs) on changes in body weight was reported [50].",14e38af0-991f-4a05-84f0-3f04b3dbc35a
27,discussion5," The detrimental effect of genetic predisposition on weight gain was reduced by greater adherence to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet; this effect was more pronounced among participants with a higher genetic risk of obesity [50]. In another study investigating three observational cohorts of US women and men, adherence to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet accentuated the detrimental effects of the genetic risk score (genetic risk score (GRS)), based on 97 body mass index (BMI)-associated variants, on body mass index (BMI) [51]. Also, in a cross-sectional study, high adherence to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet modified the effect of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) rs17782313 polymorphism on cardiometabolic risk factors, including triglyceride concentration, blood pressure, and glucose concentration, especially among MC4R rs17782313 risk allele carriers [52].",78cbfab5-df96-406d-8df0-3368b888172c
28,discussion6," Nevertheless, in the current study, we did not find any effect of interaction between the diet and rs7903146 variant on inflammatory markers in individual with type 2 diabetes. Our findings must be examined in other ethnic populations with different allele frequencies; also, family-based investigations on a large sample size are needed.  Some limitations of the current study need to be addressed. The assessment of adherence to dietary interventions was based on self-report diet records, and because of our limited funding, we could not measure the biochemical index of adherence to dietary interventions. Therefore, the dietitian called the participants once a week and encouraged their adherence to the dietary recommendations. Another limitation of this study was not blinding the participants to the study objectives, which might have affected the subjects’ behaviors.",c5896638-ce06-49ba-9761-1fa50449922e
29,discussion7," Finally, this study was conducted in an area with a middle to high socioeconomic status, and our findings cannot be extrapolated to individual with type 2 diabetes with a low socioeconomic status.  In conclusion, substituting one serving of red meat with one serving of legumes in dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, at least five days a week, could improve the hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, and malondialdehyde (MDA) in participants with type 2 diabetes regardless of having rs7903146 risk or non-risk allele.
