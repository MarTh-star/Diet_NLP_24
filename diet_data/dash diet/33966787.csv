Allocation to intervention was concealed from the principal investigators using sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes, which were only opened sequentially by a dietician in the presence of eligible participants at the first visit.  Dietary interventions  All participants were advised to complete a run-in period for 2 weeks, including adherence to their diet while eliminating legumes.

The energy requirements of each participant were estimated from the initial resting energy expenditure, based on the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, multiplied by the physical activity coefficient.  Because the participants were overweight and obese, dietary interventions were designed to provide 500–700 kcal/day less than their energy requirement. Both dietary interventions provided almost 25–30% of the energy from fat, 15% from proteins, and 55–60% from carbohydrates.",efa2dfda-1a96-4f2d-ac31-be389abcf7d1

The legume-based dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet was similar to the traditional dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, but one serving of red meat was replaced with one serving of legumes at least 5 days per week. Also, because legumes are equivalent to one serving of whole grains, one serving of bread was eliminated from the legume-based dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet.",275f49f8-837e-42a3-a33f-0669ab644f4d

All participants were asked to maintain their physical activity and not change their medications during the 16-week interventions unless prescribed by their physician. During the study, no changes in medication use were found in any participants.  Every 2 week, the dietitians called the participants to gather their dietary information using 3 day food records (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) during the run-in period and the study period.

The intake of macro- and micronutrients was also calculated using NUTRITIONIST III version 7.0 (N-Squared Computing, Salem, OR, USA), designed for Iranian food.  Measurements  Weight was measured with minimal clothing without shoes using a digital scale (Seca 707; range 0–150 kg) with an accuracy of 100 g. After a 15 min rest, blood pressure was measured using a standardized mercury sphygmomanometer on the right arm twice, at least 30 s apart. The average of the two measurements was reported as the subject’s blood pressure. Spot urine samples were obtained between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m. following overnight fasting. Urinary concentrations of sodium (mmol/dL) and potassium (mmol/dL) were measured using flame photometry (Screen Lyte, Hospitex Diagnostics, Florence, Italy).",c3766a71-7c73-4fda-b186-aa285c7b897d

18,discussion0," In the current trial among obese and overweight type 2 diabetic participants, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) was reduced by replacing one serving of red meat with legumes in the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet at least 5 days a week over 16 weeks. Further investigation of food groups in the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet showed that systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased with increasing vegetable intake, while it increased with increasing intake of energy, sodium, and sweets. Moreover, the lowest systolic blood pressure (SBP) was observed when reducing the intake of refined grains by 29.8–76.2 g/day and increasing the intake of legumes by more than 98 g/day. Additionally, when the intake of fruits exceeded certain thresholds, blood pressure did not decrease.  In the current study, adopting a traditional dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet improved systolic blood pressure (SBP) among participants with type 2 diabetes.",821c381d-6663-4fec-9d2f-735421ab18be
19,discussion1," Our findings are in line with two meta-analyses indicating that dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with a −4.70 mmHg (−5.76 to −3.63 mmHg) change in systolic blood pressure (SBP); however, despite −3.75 mmHg (−4.53 to −2.97 mmHg) change in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the meta-analysis, no reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was observed in the current study [25, 26]. Additionally, we found that replacing a serving of total red meat with legumes significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared to the traditional dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet. Contradicting our findings, adopting dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diets, independent of red meat intake, improved blood pressure among healthy, overweight and obese adults [27], and hypertensive subjects [13]. In all of these studies, however, red meat was replaced with other animal protein sources.",fd601c49-e449-4156-81d3-bbebf8a9851b
20,discussion2," In the current study, when we further investigated which individual dietary food groups in the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet contributed to blood pressure reduction, we found that changes in the red meat intake were not associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP), but the legume intake more than 98 g decreased blood pressure. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, there was no significant effect of substituting red meat with high-quality plant protein sources on blood pressure [16], which may be because the health-promoting effects of legume consumption, as seen in the current study, are achieved by consuming more than one serving per day [17].  In the current study, systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased by lowering refined grains intake from ~ 30 (1 serving/day) to ~ 80 (2.5 servings/day) g/day.",b5bc0fa3-53aa-44d3-ae9f-2db6817c0840
21,discussion3," Previous systematic review and meta-analyses, and long-term follow-up studies have reported that increasing the consumption of refined grains and sweets from 1 to 3 servings per day had no association with hypertension [28–30]. This may be because the detrimental effects of consuming refined grains on chronic diseases, as seen in the current study, are observed when the intake of refined grains exceeds 200 g/day [31]. This is in line with our study in which sweets and refined grains were consumed more than 200 g/day. However, the U-shaped effect of reducing refined grains on systolic blood pressure (SBP), both in the current study and a previous study [32], aligns with recommendations that emphasize the balanced consumption of whole grains and refined grains in the diet [33].",39faed57-2d08-4a5f-beba-8bd7aa012655
22,discussion4," In addition, despite meta-analysis studies that reported the consumption of whole grains as 50–100 g/day reduces the risk of chronic disease such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and mortality [28, 31, 34], in the current study, increasing whole grain consumption did not affect blood pressure. Further studies are needed to be clarify the type and amount of grains for preventing and managing hypertension.  Our findings on the effect of increasing fruit and vegetable intake on lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) are consistent with the meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials, which concluded that fruits and vegetables were more effective in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) [25, 28, 35] and this relationship was linear for vegetables and nonlinear for fruits [28].",13b284e6-cea6-4bdd-8135-a499fc78083c
23,discussion5," These findings are similar to our study, which showed that vegetable consumption was linearly related to systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction, but the consumption of fruits to a certain threshold reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP).  Previous clinical trials, investigating the effect of an energy restricted diet on blood pressure found that a low-energy diet reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [36, 37]. Consistently, our findings further confirm the inverse linear association between energy intake and systolic blood pressure (SBP).  The strength of the current study was the interpretation of the results based on the intention to treat (ITT) principles, low dropout rate, corrections for multiple tests, long-term nutritional intervention, and randomized trial design that allowed for controlling the confounders. Nevertheless, this study also has several limitations.",5e4427dc-1589-480e-9ed0-b425de52296d
24,discussion6,"  The participants were not blinded to the aim of the investigation (focused on increasing the intake of legumes), which may have affected their behaviors. Dietary interventions were recommended to participants, and no meals were prepared for them; therefore, the goal of the diet might not be fully attained. For this reason, the dietitian called the participants once a week and encouraged adherence to the dietary recommendations. We also gathered the food records of participants and assessed their adherence to dietary recommendations. However, these measures are insufficient for evaluating adherence to dietary interventions, and the assessment of the biochemical index of legume intake could be a more appropriate indicator. Also, financial constraints limited us to assessing dietary adherence accurately. Overall, adherence to a healthy diet is affected by socioeconomic status.",0582d0bf-7a86-45e7-a94e-ce4d35848589
25,discussion7," This study was conducted in an area with a middle to high socioeconomic status, and our findings cannot be generalized to type 2 diabetic patients with a low socioeconomic status.  Conclusions  The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, enriched in legumes, could improve systolic blood pressure (SBP) in participants with type 2 diabetes. In dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, the balance of consumption of refined grains and fruits along with higher consumption of vegetables and lower consumption of sweets, sodium and energy reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP).",c692e99f-e31f-420c-bfe1-26c1c3e41d6a
