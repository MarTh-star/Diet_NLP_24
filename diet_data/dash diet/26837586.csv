0,background0,"Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome are global public health problems [1, 2], and nutritional interventions have been recommended for their prevention and control [3–5]. Studies investigating dietary patterns provide valuable information to assess healthful or harmful dietary habits, beyond those analyzing individual nutrients or food groups alone [6–8], since foods are consumed in complex combinations and nutrients may have interactive effects [9, 10].  A recent meta-analysis of prospective observational studies including 404,528 individuals, revealed that adherence to ‘healthy’ dietary patterns significantly reduced the risk of diabetes (RR = 0.86; 95% CI 0.82, 0.90), while ‘unhealthy’ dietary patterns (generally emphasizing red meat and refined carbohydrate based foods) increased risk (RR = 1.30; 95% CI 1.18, 1.43) [11].",de8d4c9d-345a-475a-bc05-e05ad14a0869
1,background1," Additionally, a Western dietary pattern, with strong components of refined carbohydrates, and red and processed meats, is associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular diseases (CVD)) [12–14].  The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)) diet, a well-known dietary pattern specifically targeted to lowering blood pressure, was associated with lower cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk in US [15, 16] and European populations [17]. The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet also has the potential to prevent type 2 diabetes and stroke [18, 19]. A meta-analysis of intervention studies based on the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet showed reduced fasting insulin concentration and improved insulin sensitivity independently of weight loss [20].",f7310ccb-68f6-4ff2-84dc-f0e94e1afa4f
2,background2," The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet emphasizes high intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy products as well as a low intake of sodium, red and processed meats, and sweetened beverages.  The specific benefits of an increased intake of dairy foods have recently received greater attention. A pooled analysis of 7 cohort studies (254,892 participants and 19,082 cases of diabetes) revealed that higher intake of total dairy products was associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Similar inverse associations were found for low-fat dairy products, low-fat or skim milk and cheese, and for yogurt, but not for high-fat dairy products or total milk; results regarding the metabolic syndrome were inconclusive [21]. Additionally, biomarkers of dairy intake are related to a decreased incidence of diabetes [22].",be1dc45f-6831-4bc1-9c53-a02de918ec23
3,background3," Analyzing data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) study, we found that the intake of total dairy products was inversely associated with measures of glycemia, insulinemia and metabolic syndrome with a linear dose–response pattern. Interestingly, these associations were observed for full-fat dairy products and yogurt but not for low-fat dairy products [23, 24].  Further investigation of dietary patterns and their relationship with diabetes and the metabolic syndrome in distinct populations may provide valuable information with regard to the role of specific combinations of foods and nutrients. Yet, studies evaluating dietary patterns, including the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, in relation to metabolic syndrome and diabetes are scarce, especially in populations outside of Europe and North America [25].",3b9a58b8-1e8b-4c64-882d-3b66c3ac04f5

7,methods2,"  Assessment of diet and covariates Dietary data were collected using a validated food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) [27], with 114 food and drink items and covering the last 12 months. Participants were also asked to provide information on their typical eating habits, including attempts to modify their diet in the 6 months before the baseline examination.  We transformed the frequency options into daily frequencies as follows: 3 for more than 3 times/day; 2.5 for 2–3 times/day; 1 for once/day; 0.8 for 5–6 times/week; 0.4 for 2–4 times/week; 0.1 for once/week; 0.07 for 1–3 times/month; and 0 for never/almost never. Additionally, we obtained daily energy intake in kilocalories and nutrient intake using the University of Minnesota Nutrition Data System for Research database [28].",2ed35a24-d4e1-42d2-861d-31311d9d0fcc
8,methods3," For these determinations, we calculated the grams/day for each food item from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) as the quantity of servings consumed/day × weight (standard portion in grams) × frequency of consumption.  At baseline, trained interviewers collected demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, educational level, family income, occupational status, study site), family history of diabetes, menopausal status and lifestyle factors: smoking (current and previous), alcohol intake and physical activity. Alcohol intake was estimated as the sum of ethanol (g/week) of all beverages consumed. Physical activity variables were defined by using the leisure activity section of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)), long form, according to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) guidelines for data processing and analysis.",7bd0f294-6f69-4f55-a03c-d9de6f3d16f4
9,methods4," Median (interquartile range) metabolic equivalent min/week were computed for walking, moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity activities, and summed to obtain a combined leisure-time total physical activity score [29].  We performed anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and waist circumference) with participants standing, dressed in light standard uniforms, without shoes in the fasting state. We measured body weight to the nearest 0.1 kg with a calibrated balance (Toledo 2096PP) and height with a vertical stadiometer (Seca-SE-216) to the nearest 0.1 cm. Waist circumference was measured with a tape measure to the nearest 0.1 cm around the midpoint between the inferior costal border and the iliac crest. body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2).",e3a00305-e707-4f0a-8350-cff6169545f4
10,methods5,"  Definition of metabolic syndrome Blood was drawn by venipuncture after an overnight fast of 8–15 h, and a standard 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was administered for all participants who did not report a diagnosis or current treatment for diabetes. Glucose was measured by an ADVIA 1200 chemistry hexokinase system (Siemens); glycated hemoglobin using an HPLC assay (Bio-Rad D-10 Dual Program Laboratories) certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program; and HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides using enzymatic procedures (ADVIA 1200).  Resting blood pressure was measured 3 times at 1-min intervals using a 765CP oscillometric sphygmomanometer (Omron) with participants seated after a 5-min rest. The average of the second and third measurements was used in the analyses.",e408d359-93be-4912-9581-2848359875d9
11,methods6,"  We used the joint interim statement consensus criteria [30] for diagnosing metabolic syndrome, which requires the presence of any 3 of the following 5 risk factors: elevated waist circumference (≥102 cm in men and ≥88 cm in women), hypertriglyceridemia (≥1.69 mmol/L/150 mg/dL or drug treatment), reduced HDL-cholesterol (<1.03 mmol/L/<40 mg/dL for men and <1.29 mmol/L/<50 mg/dL for women, or drug treatment), elevated blood pressure (≥130 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mmHg and/or drug treatment), and elevated fasting glucose (≥100 mg/dL/5.6 mmol/L or drug treatment).  Definition of newly diagnosed diabetes After excluding participants with previously diagnosed diabetes, we considered as newly diagnosed diabetes participants with fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, 2-h postload glucose ≥200 mg/dL or HbA1c ≥6.5%.

12,analysis0,"Dietary patterns were derived using principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)). All 114 foods and beverages, including alcohol, were standardized to per day units. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin test (>0.6) and Bartlett’s test of sphericity (p < 0.05) were applied to verify whether the principal component analysis (PCA) assumptions were all met. The factors were rotated orthogonally by the varimax method, and those with eigenvalues ≥1.5 were retained. To determine the number of factors to retain, we also considered the scree plot and factor interpretability. Factor was interpreted based on food items with loadings ≥0.20. We identified four dietary patterns and named them according to food items showing high loadings (Table 1). Factors extracted did not vary by sex and study site. Factor scores were determined for each participant by multiplying standardized intake of each food item (grams/day) by its respective loading factor on each factor.",9dcfbdaf-8f75-418e-8676-f597adb1bc24
13,analysis1," Factor scores were thus linear variables, representing the weighted sum across all 114 food and beverage items. Individuals were classified into quintiles of each factor score. Results are presented for three groups: high adherence (fifth quintile); mid adherence (third quintile); low adherence (first quintile) to a given pattern quintile.   A dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) Diet quality score was also created to assess adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet [16]. This score considered intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy products as well as that of sodium, red and processed meats, and sweetened beverages.",19c8a697-765e-4364-ae8c-d4bf798344e7
14,analysis2," For each of these components, subjects were classified into sex-specific quintiles according to their intake, with values being assigned to each quintile (from 1 for the lowest intake to 5 for the highest, except for the components sodium, and red and processed meats, and sweetened beverages for which the scoring was reversed). We summed up the eight dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) component scores to obtain an overall dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score ranging from 8 (lowest adherence) to 40 (highest adherence) [17].  Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the adjusted association of the different dietary patterns with metabolic syndrome and newly diagnosed diabetes. A linear trend was tested by modeling categorical quintiles of dietary patterns consumption as a continuous variable in the multivariable regression models. We evaluated interactions between dietary patterns and excess weight (body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2).",ab3ee989-ef05-4d66-93b2-b8668958d9eb
15,analysis3," We adjusted for covariates (potential confounders) in 2 models: model 1 included demographic covariates, menopausal status, and family history of diabetes; model 2 included all variables from model 1 plus body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), physical activity, current and previous smoking, alcohol intake, and calories/day. Our intention was to separate the adjustment for obesity and related behavioral characteristics. Since obesity may be interpreted as a confounder or as a mediator of the associations, we provide results for both models, facilitating interpretation of potential confounding. Multivariable linear regression was performed to investigate adjusted associations of different dietary patterns with components of metabolic syndrome: fasting glucose, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Further, in a northern German cohort, a pattern characterized by high intake of potatoes, various vegetables, beef, pork, processed meat, fats, sauce and bouillon, reflecting a ‘traditional German diet’, was positively associated with metabolic syndrome [33].

Dairy products are dense in nutrients, including dietary saturated fatty acids present in full-fat dairy products. It has been postulated that the impact of these saturated fatty acids on metabolic risk may be influenced by the food and nutrient matrix involved with dairy intake, including micronutrients such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium, which may contribute to lower the risk of newly diagnosed diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [37].",812077f5-0910-4e28-8e66-285e840c9b55
35,discussion5," In our recent finding from the ELSA-Brasil study, the only nutrient that materially changed the associations of greater dairy intake with lesser frequency of metabolic syndrome was saturated fatty acids from dairy products [22]. Similarly, a population-based prospective cohort study in Sweden found that high intake of full-fat dairy products was associated with decreased incidence of diabetes, compared to low-fat dairy products, whereas the consumption of both low- and high-fat meats was associated with increased incidence [38]. Addition of full fat dairy as a covariate in our adjusted model in fact decreased somewhat the inverse association found, suggesting that full fat dairy may mediate, in part, this association.  It is not clear how dietary fat content and food sources of fat may modulate the effect of saturated fatty acids on risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The major food sources of saturated fatty acid are of animal origin, including meat and dairy products.",2b36f0d7-2d9d-4cfd-8d2a-1b26fcb77aa5

[38] observed a decreased incidence of diabetes at high intake of high-fat dairy products but not of low-fat dairy products, and meat intake was associated with increased risk independently of fat content. Analyzing saturated fatty acids with shorter chain lengths (4:0–10:0), mainly found in dairy products, the study indicated protective associations with diabetes. Dairy products are also better sources of lauric acid (12:0) and myristic acid (14:0). In contrast, palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0), which are abundant in both dairy foods and meat, fish, and eggs, showed null associations with diabetes [38]. In our previous ELSA analysis, we found that myristic acid could explain the association between dairy product consumption and glycemia, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin concentrations [23].",3eb2d6a1-cf3a-4a74-a322-7f90ae0231da
37,discussion7," A Dutch study with 12 years of follow-up found a lower ischemic heart disease risk with a higher intake of saturated fatty acids, and that this association was apparently mainly driven by short- to medium-chain saturated fatty, myristic acid, the sum of pentadecylic and margaric acids, and saturated fatty acids from dairy sources including butter, cheese, and milk and milk products [39]. A recent meta-analysis relating diabetes with consumption of butter, the dairy product highest in fat content, found that in four cohort studies (201,628 participants and 23,954 incident diabetes cases) butter consumption was associated with lower incidence of type 2 diabetes, with 4% lower risk per 14 g daily intake (RR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93,0.99) [40].",d0b3f5a7-3f28-4292-a7a5-903d0a21dd2d
38,discussion8,"  In the present study we found that blood pressure was lower with increased adherence to diet, light foods and beverages/low fat dairy (P4) and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet patterns, which both include low fat dairy in their composition. We previously observed in ELSA a significant, inverse, graded dose–response association between total dairy intake and adjusted systolic and diastolic blood pressure [24]. In addition to the saturated fatty acids present in dairy, other nutritional components may be involved in the reduction of the metabolic syndrome. Milk proteins have an angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory effect and the inhibition of the renin angiotensin system in adipocytes can potentially reduce hypertension [41].",5cafc62e-e5d9-42eb-97dd-d3290cd40226
39,discussion9," Calcium reduces blood pressure by modulation of smooth muscle reactivity and vitamin D may reduce dyslipidemia and improve blood pressure through maintenance of calcium homeostasis, stimulation of insulin production and release, and regulation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system [40]. In contrast, a recent Mendelian randomization study using a lactase persistence genotype as an instrumental variable found that while this genotype was associated with greater dairy consumption, it showed no association with blood pressure [42].  Our findings of increased frequencies of newly diagnosed diabetes and the metabolic syndrome among those with greater adherence to the dietary pattern diet, light foods and beverages/low fat dairy (P4) might be explained by reverse causality, since a presumed knowledge of increased risk of diabetes could have led some participants to this pattern of “dieting”, or due to residual confounding, as previously suggested [43, 44].",d28b75b0-3971-45cd-b00d-dc385dd6a9af
40,discussion10," Two additional interpretations are worth considering. First, habitual consumption of artificially sweeteners may increase the risk of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome [45–47], perhaps by alterations in the intestinal microbiota [48] or by imbalance of sweetness and caloric content (simulating a fasting state), which may trigger sensory and behavioral responses to increase caloric consumption [49]. Second, very low dietary fat intake (<15%) has been related with a higher incidence of metabolic syndrome [50].  Our findings that greater adherence to the vegetables/fruits (P1) dietary pattern did not associate with lesser frequencies of newly diagnosed diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, and was only associated with slightly lower waist circumferences are puzzling.",f6edffe2-a94d-45f4-afc3-44c65edea0e5
41,discussion11," Interestingly, in the PREvencion con DIeta MEDiterranea (PREDIMED) trial, a significant inverse association for fiber and fruits with risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) was seen only in minimally adjusted models, but not in fully adjusted models [51].  It is reassuring that the dietary patterns here derived were similar to those generated using a different methodology [52]. In the previous analyses consumption of fast-foods (and other unhealthy foods) were mixed with beans, fruits and vegetables, and most likely decreased the potential nutritional benefits of the latter foods. In this regard, it is important to highlight the emphasis on natural rather than processed foods given in the new Brazilian Dietary Guideline for the Brazilian population.  A major strength of this study is the direct measurements of the outcomes, including measurements of the cardiometabolic risk factors and detection of diabetes by a standardized 75-g oral-glucose-tolerance test and glycated hemoglobin.",a24c1d67-16d8-4436-a5e5-517d28c66b54
42,discussion12," However, this study has some limitations. We measured dietary intake with a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), a typical choice in large epidemiologic studies. This method is subject to random and systematic errors, although this limitation would most likely have resulted in a nondifferential misclassification with respect to outcomes and a likely underestimation of associations. Another limitation is that the factor analyses used to identify the dietary patterns depend on several decisions made by the researcher, such as number of factors to be retained. Furthermore, we used cross-sectional data to identify the association of dietary patterns with the metabolic syndrome and diabetes, and because of the observational nature of our study, it is possible that our findings result from reverse causality or residual confounding, the latter despite the fact that we extensively adjusted for other dietary variables and risk factors.",c72b96ab-0e2c-4378-9684-4ae8a3868fc5
43,discussion13," It is also possible that some of the participants for whom we ascertained newly diagnosed diabetes reported a higher adherence to the vegetable/fruits and to the diet/light food patterns in response to their perceived propensity to develop diabetes (e.g. family history, knowledge of intermediate hyperglycemia). Although the exclusions we made aimed to prevent some of these potential biases, they may also introduce selectin bias. However, previously reported comparisons suggest that this is unlikely [23].  In conclusion, the inverse associations found for the dietary pattern characterizing Brazilian fast foods and desserts, typically containing dairy products, with newly diagnosed diabetes, and for the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet with metabolic syndrome, support previously demonstrated beneficial effects of dairy products in metabolism.",be264a75-8d44-4636-8677-4849a0cb936f
44,discussion14," The positive association with metabolic syndrome and newly diagnosed diabetes found for the pattern characterizing a typical Brazilian meal deserves further investigation, particularly since it is frequently accompanied by processed meat.
