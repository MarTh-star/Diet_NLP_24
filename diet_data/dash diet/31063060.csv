0,introduction0," Hypertension, the most common non-communicable disease worldwide, represents a significant global public health issue. Based on the 2017 American Heart Association (American Heart Association (AHA)) guidelines, the prevalence of hypertension among US adults is estimated to be 46% [1]; additionally, ~50% of hypertensive individuals are estimated to be salt sensitive (SS) [2]. As noted by the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion report [3] ~90% of American adults consume an excess of dietary sodium (Na+), with an average daily consumption exceeding 3400 mg in adult US males, a value almost three times the daily consumption recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) [4] and the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Dietary Reference Intakes (Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)) [5].",1d92cab9-5033-452d-a15a-220c2deb223b
1,introduction1," Given that excess dietary Na+ intake, which can drive the salt sensitivity of blood pressure and increase hypertension risk, global dietary Na+ intake is a public health risk. The impact of dietary Na+ intake on blood pressure has been investigated in multiple dietary intervention trials generating evidence that reduced dietary salt intake in controlled settings leads to reductions in blood pressure [6–8]. Further, meta-analyses have correlated dietary Na+ restriction with reductions in blood pressure suggesting there is a health benefit in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals irrespective of the salt sensitivity of blood pressure [9, 10].  Recent evidence suggests the salt sensitivity of blood pressure may be modulated, in part, by dietary potassium (K+) intake. Increasing dietary K+ intake appears to counteract the effects of dietary Na+ intake on increasing blood pressure [11–13].",c7a940b3-2509-4b48-a0de-3706ba8d8eee
2,introduction2," Despite several studies that have documented blood pressure lowering effects of increasing K+ intake, the 2019 National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) for sodium and potassium Report did not establish a Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) for K+. This report concluded that more evidence is required to support a Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) of K+ with particular reference to a lack of K+ dose-response trials limiting the evidence to establish a K+ Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) [5]. Several studies have reported that the urinary Na+:K+ ratio has a stronger association with blood pressure than Na+ or K+ independently [14, 15]. Largely based on these data, a urinary Na+ to K+ molar ratio of <1 has been recommended [16, 17] as a beneficial target to improve long-term blood pressure control.",b301c02a-0bbd-4625-930b-4fd5bf9f73ae
3,introduction3," Given the high global dietary Na+ intake this would necessitate dietary, or other means, of K+ supplementation—for which a Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) has not been established [5]. A leading dietary intervention study was the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension 2 Trial (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium) conducted between 1997 and 2002 [18]. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium trial was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial that examined the impact of three levels dietary Na+ intake in combination with either a control or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and reduced in total fat) on blood pressure.",b5101933-34dc-4bee-a390-35b93b867f79
4,introduction4," This study demonstrated substantial effects of dietary Na+ reduction and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on reducing blood pressure, with more significant blood pressure lowering effects with the combination of a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet plus dietary Na+ reduction than dietary Na+ restriction alone in individuals with higher than optimal blood pressure [7]. Given that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet intervention elevated dietary K+ intake by increasing dietary intake of fruits and vegetables in combination with modifying daily dietary Na+ intake, examining the potential interaction between dietary Na+ and K+ intake on blood pressure in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial will provide valuable insight into the potential influence of dietary K+ on blood pressure.",a19ed4b4-afdb-4068-840b-ca3cc9474cc2
5,introduction5,"  The primary goal of this study was to analyze urinary Na+, K+ and the Na+:K+ excretion ratio, for associations with changes in systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) in participants from the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)–Sodium trial during the initial screening period in which participants were consuming their regular diet without dietary intervention. The secondary goals of this study were to investigate: (a) the impact of the salt sensitivity of blood pressure on these responses and (b) the impact of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)–Sodium dietary intervention, which lowers systolic blood pressure (SBP) and increases dietary K+ intake, on these potential associations.",a2dea8f1-1254-4c9d-a226-a1d425abc316

Collectively our data support the recent Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) recommendation not to propose a Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) for K+ and suggest that further evidence is required to support the establishment of a Na+/K+ excretion ratio that would reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the general population.

The design of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)–Sodium trial has been described in detail previously [18]. In brief, and summarized in Fig. 1, a randomized control trial was conducted in 412 individuals who were healthy adults aged 22 years or older who were not taking any antihypertensive medications with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 120–159 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) of 80–95 mmHg (range normal to Stage 1 hypertension).",54181aec-985a-4dc7-8eda-fe41b8f25d2f

Each dietary arm was further randomized in a crossover design resulting in each participant receiving their respective diet (control or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) containing low (LS; 50 mmol Na+/day—optimal daily Na+ intake), intermediate (IS; 100 mmol Na+/day—upper limit of daily Na+ intake recommendations), or high (HS; 150 mmol Na+/day—current average daily US Na+ intake) Na+ content, for 30 days each in a randomized order.

10,methods3,"  In the current study, we utilized screening values for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and urinary laboratory parameters from 222 SS and 186 of SR participants to evaluate Na+ and K+ interactions with baseline blood pressure. In order to assess potential interactions of urinary Na+ and K+ with systolic blood pressure (SBP) in response to changes from the HS to the LS Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, we assessed systolic blood pressure (SBP) only, and urinary parameter values from participants from which all three urine samples (Screening, LS, and HS) were available for analysis.

11,methods4,"  Data analysis  In the original Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)–Sodium trial, the baseline blood pressure used for analysis was the mean of value recorded during screening and the run-in period, and the blood pressure for the intervention period was the mean of the last five measurements at the end of each intervention. Baseline blood pressure and the clinical centers were represented as fixed effects, and the intervention periods were represented as random effects. The generalized estimating equation module of Stata was employed to compute power, and the residual variance estimate value and standard deviation for each estimate were provided. As has been previously reported the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)–Sodium trial was sufficiently powered to detect changes evoked by the dietary interventions on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).",63de705b-66a0-41ac-a442-a92ef5665e63

32,discussion3," We speculate this discrepancy between a positive relationship between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and urinary Na+ excretion within the expected range of dietary Na+ excretion of 3–5 g/day and no association over the complete range of values reflects the impact of multiple participants in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)–Sodium study exhibiting high levels of urinary Na+ excretion, greater than 5 g/day, and comparatively low blood pressure. Significantly, the value obtained in this study for an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) within 3–5 g/day Na+ excretion is comparable to that obtained in the PURE study which reported a positive slope increment of a 1.7 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) per 1 g increase in urinary Na+ excretion across the same range of Na+ excretion values [23].",ac5e68b8-d6d5-4f6e-bb57-6d96366d4c09
33,discussion4," The difference between the observed increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) in response to elevated urinary Na+ excretion between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium and PURE may reflect (1) significant differences in sample size and racial backgrounds of the participants and (2) the potential differences in methods to assess urine content of 24-h urine collection compared to an estimation from a single morning spot urine sample in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium versus PURE Study respectively. Our data support guidelines to limit dietary Na+ intake [5, 24] and suggest that reduced dietary salt intake may only lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) in SS patients.  The influence of K+ intake on blood pressure remains controversial, with conflicting data emerging from multiple clinical studies [25].",36d06ccd-1c58-4b95-9520-86eb787dd454

In this study increased K+ intake up to 40 mmol/day had no impact on blood pressure [22, 26]. A separate randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial was conducted in participants who have never received antihypertensive medication with mildly elevated blood pressure [27]. Participants were maintained on their normal diet and received K+ at 64 mmol/day for a 4-week period as either potassium chloride or bicarbonate—in this study there was no effect of K+ supplementation on office blood pressure [27].",23c919d5-217a-424c-8d70-59f292ebc511
35,discussion6," In contrast in a randomized placebo-controlled, crossover study, in which untreated patients with a mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 145 mmHg blood pressure received 4 weeks of supplemental K+ at 3 g/day and a diet relatively low in Na+ reported a reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 3.9 mmHg. Beyond the highly controlled trials discussed above the PURE study reports that for each increment of 1 g/day of urinary K+ excretion there is a reduction of 0.75 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) across the excretion range of <1.25 to 3 g K+/day [23]. In the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)–Sodium data, we observed an elevation in systolic blood pressure (SBP) in both SS and SR participants when urinary K+ excretion was below 1 g/day. However, we did not observe any correlation between urinary K+ excretion and systolic blood pressure (SBP) or an impact of urinary K+ excretion on systolic blood pressure (SBP) over the range of <1 to >3 g K+ excretion per day.",8e68f095-910c-48d8-871f-820e679fe2ab
36,discussion7," We speculate that discrepancy between the PURE study data and our own analysis of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium data may reflect the difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) response to urinary K+ excretion reported in PURE between Chinese and non-Chinese participants. Chinese participants exhibited a large reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) with increased urinary K+ excretion versus a smaller systolic blood pressure (SBP) effect in participants from the rest of the world. As the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium trial did not contain Chinese participants this may have influenced the outcome.  Further, several studies have suggested that the blood pressure reduction evoked by K+ intake may be dependent on dietary Na+ intake [28, 29].",ef35a616-6abf-4228-b3ef-a3f079372024
37,discussion8," In our analysis of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium dataset we observed no association with urinary K+ excretion and systolic blood pressure (SBP), during the patient screening visit or during Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary intervention when Na+ intake was modified, suggesting an independence of the effects of Na+ and K+ on systolic blood pressure (SBP) in this study. The 2019 Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) Report concluded that there is insufficient evidence on the effects of K+ on blood pressure and did not establish a Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) of K+ [5]. Our data support the 2019 Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) Report and suggests that dietary K+ supplementation may not significantly reduce blood pressure in the general population.  At present there is conflicting evidence regarding the potential blood pressure lowering effects of a reduction in urinary Na+/K+ excretion.",8c8399f2-6d4a-455a-ac49-307ec5efd22b
38,discussion9," The TAIM randomized control trial in hypertensive participants on a pharmacological intervention reported no significant difference in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the control diet group and a low Na+/high K+ diet group during a six month period [30]. This suggests long-term reductions in the urinary ratio do not lower blood pressure. Despite several prior studies reporting an association between blood pressure and the urinary Na+/K+ ratio there are several limitations to be considered. A multicenter study by Suppa et al. conducted in hypertensive participants reported a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) following 4 weeks of modified low sodium high potassium salt intake compared to participants receiving a normal salt intake [31], yet all participants were receiving a beta blocker, which is not standard first line treatment for hypertension [1].",4653ce33-3753-4a7b-9386-236a85773638
39,discussion10," Further, the INTERSALT study, which documented a positive association between the urinary Na+/K+ ratio and blood pressure reported a loss of statistical significance of the correlation in 44 of the 52 centers after adjustment for covariates including age, sex and BMI [32, 33]. In addition, a cross-sectional study, the Dallas heart study, which reported an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) for an increase in the urinary Na+/K+ ratio is limited by the modest correlation the use of single morning urine sample [34]. The PURE study reported a strong linear association between estimated Na+/K+ ratio and systolic blood pressure (SBP), that was maintained after covariate adjustment, with the greatest systolic blood pressure (SBP) observed with the highest estimated K+ and lowest estimated K+ excretion [23].",b4535549-9024-450b-8394-b361de54dc54
40,discussion11," Although we observed that a daily K+ excretion of <1 g/day is associated with elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) we observed no association between the urinary Na+/K+ excretion ratio and systolic blood pressure (SBP) at screening or following Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-dietary intervention in SS or SR participants. In conjunction with the study by Zanetti et al. [35], our data suggest high Na+ and low K+ excretion may increase the likelihood of having increased systolic blood pressure (SBP). However, the lack of association between urinary Na+/K+ ratio and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in our data do not support a urinary Na+/K+ molar excretion ratio of 1:1 as a mechanism to lower blood pressure [16, 17].",0f5a8926-2305-490f-b088-ccf961edcd0a
41,discussion12,"  The current study has several strengths: (1) The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) -Sodium trial was a carefully controlled feeding study and compliance was continuously monitored, (2) The crossover design for Na+ intervention allowed participant’s to serve as their own control and diminished inter-person variability, (3) 24-h ambulatory blood pressure recordings were taken, (4) absence of the confounding effects of antihypertensive mediations, and (5) 24-h urine sample collection. The major limitation of the present study is the relatively modest sample size that may have decreased our statistical power to detect modest effects of urinary Na+, K+, and Na+:K+ ratio on systolic blood pressure (SBP). While we did not observe an imbalance in baseline characteristics, residual confounding in our analysis is possible.",98e55a16-f3c5-4a61-9b4c-4207c7b89b73
42,discussion13,  In conclusion the current analysis of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)–Sodium Trial demonstrates that dietary K+ supplementation is not associated with lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) and that the reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) observed following Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary intervention occurred independently of a decrease in the urinary Na+/K+ excretion ratio irrespective of the salt sensitivity of blood pressure. Our data do not support the establishment of a 1:1 molar excretion ratio of Na+/K+ as blood pressure lowering strategy in US African American and non-African Americans and support the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) recommendation not to propose daily K+ intake guidelines.,beec9774-2e4a-4c5a-8aa0-656e70812804
43,discussion14," Given the limitations of the current analysis and the ongoing controversy regarding the role of dietary K+ on blood pressure future carefully controlled studies are required to elucidate the potential impact of dietary K+ and urinary Na+/K+ excretion ratio on blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive SS and SR participants.  Summary  What is known about the topic  Several clinical trials, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) – Sodium trial have established significant effects of dietary sodium reduction on lowering blood pressure.  Increased potassium intake in combination with reduced sodium intake appears to lower blood pressure and a urinary sodium to potassium molar ratio of <1 has been proposed to improve blood pressure control.",4db8a631-58de-46b9-83b0-69a8c6da884e
44,discussion15,"  Although potassium potentially modulates blood pressure, the 2019 National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Dietary Reference Intakes for Sodium and Potassium Report states that more evidence is required to establish a daily potassium intake level.  What this study adds  Urinary potassium excretion ≥1 g/day does not correlate with lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) irrespective of the salt sensitivity of blood pressure in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)–Sodium trial participants supporting the recent Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) recommendations not to propose potassium intake guidelines.  The reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) in salt sensitive and salt resistant individuals following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary intervention occurred independently of a reduction in urinary sodium to potassium excretion ratio.",5fae2595-ab99-4193-9383-442a39555d48
45,discussion16," These findings do not support the establishment of 1:1 molar excretion ratio of urinary sodium to potassium for blood pressure reduction.
