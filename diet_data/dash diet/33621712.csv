Subjects  The participants were pregnant women who were enrolled in the DASDIA (DASh diet for pregnant women with DIAbetes) randomized controlled clinical trial carried out at the Maternity School of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with the aim of evaluating the effect of the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with pregestational DM (2016–2020, Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry RBR-4tbgv6). Eighty-seven pregnant women participated in the DASDIA trial, of whom 70 were included in the present study because valid data were available for performing the nutrigenetic analyses.  The participants were pregnant women with pregestational DM; 18 years or older; less than 28 weeks pregnant at the time of inclusion in the study; single fetus; no alcohol, tobacco, or drug use; no sexually transmitted disease (e.g., syphilis, genital herpes, HPV); no psychiatric diseases (e.g.",7da52e49-da2c-45af-9349-e963550eeb3a

Pregnant women with treated and controlled hypothyroidism (TSH 0.1–2.5 mUI/L in the first trimester or 0.3–3.0 mUI/L in the second trimester, using levothyroxine) or chronic hypertension (systolic blood pressure <160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure <110, using methyldopa, without SHG) were included. The eligible participants were randomly assigned to one of two parallel study groups, traditional diet or Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, using a computer-generated list of random numbers prepared by the head investigator (even numbers to Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet group and odd numbers to traditional diet group). The participants were blinded to allocation.

Women with gestational DM were excluded from the study. Following the institutional protocol, all participants were treated with insulin therapy, which was prescribed by physicians according to individual needs.  2.3. Diet Groups and Nutritional Guidance  The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups of nutritional guidance, a traditional diet or the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Women in both groups received individual nutritional guidance from a registered dietitian from the date of inclusion in the study until the last prenatal appointment in six scheduled visits. The time of intervention was defined as the time between inclusion in the study and childbirth.",f2fcf814-7141-4906-b591-ee505016bc1f
3,methods3,"  Both traditional and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets were designed to contain 45–55% carbohydrates, 15–20% protein, and 25–30% total fat. However, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was richer in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products and included a serving of nuts per day. The original North American version of the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was translated and adapted for the DASDIA trial, considering the characteristics of Brazilian pregnant women with DM, as detailed elsewhere [28]. The traditional diet was a healthy diet currently prescribed for all pregnant women with DM-attending prenatal care at the maternity hospital.  The main differences in the composition of the traditional and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets based on the 2100 kcal meal plan are provided in Table 1.",8fa04215-9c1a-4b7f-910a-449da0eb7f0f
4,methods4,"  The daily energy intake was calculated individually in order to formulate recommendations according to age, physical activity, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), and recommended gestational weight gain (GWG) for each woman in both groups. All participants received a meal plan with a list of equivalents based on the traditional or Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which was explained in detail and revised at each appointment with the registered dietitian, with reinforcement of the nutritional orientations for both diets until the last visit [28].  Adherence to the diets was assessed using a 24-h dietary recall and by applying a tool with four evaluation items, which was scored from 0 to 4 points according to (1) quantity of food consumed—portions; (2) food groups consumed—variety; (3) consumed meals—number and time; and (4) gestational weight gain—adequate when no more than 20% less or above the recommended amount [29].",226aa430-d4a5-4b47-8ad6-7789891b77c7
5,methods5," The adherence score was stratified into low-to-moderate adherence (<2 points) and high adherence (≥2 points). For the present analyses, we considered the adherence score obtained at the visit closest to childbirth to reflect the longest possible time of exposure to the intervention.  To improve adherence, participants in the traditional diet group received a bottle of extra virgin olive oil (500 mL) at the first visit, a can of powdered semi-skimmed milk (300 mg), and a pack of oats (250 mg) at each subsequent visit, while the participants in the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet group received a bottle of extra virgin olive oil (500 mL) at the first visit, a can of powdered skimmed milk (280 mg), and a pack of nuts (150 mg) and seeds (200 mg) at each subsequent visit.  2.4. Outcome  The main outcome was excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) (kg).",fb4adf26-233e-40a5-b148-9552752f3f31
6,methods6," The recommended gestational weight gain (GWG) was defined according to the Institute of Medicine guidelines [6,7] considering the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI): underweight, 12.5 to 18 kg; normal weight, 11.5 to 16 kg; overweight, 7 to 11.5 kg; and obesity, 5 to 9 kg. Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) was the total weight gain of pregnancy exceeding the maximum amount recommended by IOM [6,7] according to pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI): gestational weight gain (GWG) > 18 kg, >16 kg, >11.5 kg, and >9 kg for underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese women, respectively. The time until excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) was estimated by linear interpolation, assuming a linearly increasing weight gain between different measurements.  To calculate the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), height was measured during the first prenatal visit, and weight was measured at each prenatal visit by nursing technicians and registered in the medical record.",f4d23502-aa28-414e-af1e-33f75731ec53
7,methods7," Pre-pregnancy weight was the self-reported weight of a woman near conception [30]. The pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was calculated as (pre-pregnancy weight/height2) and was classified as underweight (body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (body mass index (BMI) 18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (body mass index (BMI) 25.0–29.9 kg/m2), or obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30.0 kg/m2) [31].  The last pregnancy weight was measured on admission for childbirth. gestational weight gain (GWG) was calculated as (weight at admission for childbirth–pre-pregnancy weight), representing the total weight gain during pregnancy.  2.5.

Paired linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns were determined for each gene using r2 statistics (r2 cutoff ≥ 0.8). Haplotype frequencies or allelic phase determination were estimated by expectation maximization (EM algorithm), and estimation uncertainty was included in the statistical models applied for association analyses in the form of weights.

Pregnant women who did not present with the outcome were considered from the most likely date of conception and censored on the day of delivery.  The results of the time-to-event analyses were presented in the form of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs, and the risks of progression to the events described above were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models.

Nonetheless, we had a limited sample size (n = 70) that reached 56.35% statistical power for this analysis.  3. Results  Of the 249 pregnant women with pregestational DM assessed for eligibility, 87 were included in the DASDIA clinical trial, and 70 were included in the present study because there were sufficient data for the analyses: 41 in the traditional diet group and 29 in the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet group (Figure 1).  The median age was 32 years (interquartile ranges (IQR) 25.7–36.0), and the gestational age at randomization was 15 weeks (interquartile ranges (IQR) 11.1–20.1). DM type 1 was 51.4% (n = 36) of the cases. The distribution of the variables was homogeneous among the diet groups (Table 2).  The genotypic frequencies of rs9939609–FTO were TT 40%, AT 48.6%, and AA 11.4%, while for rs17817449–FTO, the values were TT 45.7%, GT 44.",4ed0a896-b7be-4570-b64e-648a232f9c6e
15,methods16,"  In the overall sample (n = 70), 28.6% of the women had a normal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), 35.7% were overweight, and 35.7% were obese. None of the pregnant women were underweight pre-pregnancy. The median gestational weight gain (GWG) was 13.7 kg (interquartile ranges (IQR) 11.5–17.5), 11.8 kg (interquartile ranges (IQR) 7.5–16.4), and 11.0 (interquartile ranges (IQR) 5.9–14.1) for normal-weight, overweight, and obese women, respectively, without differences between diet groups (Supplementary Table S1). We found no statistically significant interaction between diet and genotype on gestational weight gain (GWG) but a marginal effect for the AA genotype of rs9939609–FTO and GG genotype of rs17817449–FTO (p = 0.05 and p = 0.08, respectively) on higher gestational weight gain (GWG) comparing to another genotypes, only in the traditional diet group (Supplementary Figure S1).

16,methods19,"  Although rs17817449 alone was not associated with the outcome, in the haplotype analysis of rs9939609:rs17817449 (TT/AG/AT), we found a higher risk for earlier excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) among AG carriers: the A allele for rs9939609 and the G allele for rs17817449 (aHR 1.79; CI 95% 1.04–3.06; p = 0.02). We found no association between haplotype analysis of the ADRB2 gene in our sample (Table 7).  4. Discussion  In a sample of 70 Brazilian pregnant women with pregestational DM, we found that the A allele carriers for rs9939609 (FTO gene) and rs1042713 (ADRB2 gene) had more than twice the risk of earlier exceeding gestational weight gain (GWG) compared to TT and GG genotypes, respectively. The haplotype rs9939609:rs17817449 (AG) was also a risk factor, increasing 1.8 times in terms of the progression to excessive gestational weight gain (GWG).",e6c29c53-ece6-445c-8e6e-2189fed58ffc
17,methods20," Time of living with DM of ≥8 years, pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity, and previous hypothyroidism were risk factors for earlier excessive gestational weight gain (GWG). However, age ≥ 32 years old was a protective factor. We found no effect of the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on the risk for progression to excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), but our results of non-association need to be interpreted with caution because of our limited statistical power.  The allele frequencies in our sample were close to the frequencies in global databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp (accessed on 18 January 2022)). Common polymorphisms (>5% allele frequency) are expected to be shared across different geographical regions and populations [36]. However, the Brazilian population is highly admixed and underrepresented in genomic studies as a potential source of new phenotype-associated genetic variants [37].",994ecade-3a99-4e4c-84bd-b80371fcb64c
18,methods21,"  The A allele for the rs9939609 polymorphism in the FTO gene was previously associated with higher body mass index (BMI) before and after pregnancy [38,39] but not with excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) [15] in Brazilian women. Studies from the USA [12,13] and Spain [14] found a higher risk of having higher gestational weight gain (GWG) among A-allele carriers, contradicting the results from Turkey [40] and Mexico [41], both without association. The other evaluated polymorphisms (FTO rs17817449, ADRB2 rs1042713, and rs1042714) have not been previously investigated for gestational weight gain (GWG). The haplotype rs9939609:rs17817449 (AT) was found to increase the risk of obesity in the Brazilian adult population [11], but we identified the role of AG in the risk of progression to gestational weight gain (GWG).  The effect of the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on weight gain during pregnancy is controversial. Van Horn et al.",782422bd-42a7-47cc-8768-d9585d2dfc86
19,methods22," (2018) noted that overweight and obese pregnant women (n = 280, EUA) gained less weight and had less excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) using the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet than by using a control diet [42], whereas Fulay et al. (2018) reported that high adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with more weight gain during pregnancy in obese women (n = 1760, EUA) [43].  Genetics may partially explain the interindividual variation in body weight in response to nutritional intervention [44]; thus, it was hypothesized that the FTO and ADRB2 polymorphisms could modify the effect of diet on gestational weight gain (GWG). We found a marginal association of the FTO polymorphisms on the gestational weight gain (GWG) according to the type of diet: women with the AA genotype for rs9939609 and women with the GG genotype for rs17817449 had higher gestational weight gain (GWG) in the traditional diet group.",01e85669-2e4c-48db-bc10-fdb3648fc3db
20,methods23," This result could represent some benefit of the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on limiting gestational weight gain (GWG) for women with these genotypes, but it was not confirmed in the analysis adjusted for the main confounders, as we found no effect of diet on the risk for progression to excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) in our sample.  Martins et al. (2018) reported that the A allele for rs9939609 was associated with an increase in the total energy intake and increase in the percentage of energy from ultra-processed foods during pregnancy in a cohort of Brazilian women [45]. In our study, we calculated the individualized meal plan for all participants in both groups, considering the appropriate gestational weight gain (GWG), and we found similar high adherence to diet in the groups (40%).",bc1f246d-d175-4997-8b24-665d10c348b4
21,methods24," Indeed, the evaluation of dietary intake in details deserves further analyses to clarify if the genetic polymorphisms affect the gestational weight gain (GWG) by dietary characteristics other than the dietary pattern (traditional or Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)), such as the level of food processing, for example.  Pregestational overweight and obesity were risk factors for progression to excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) in our sample. This result agrees with the study by Brandão et al. (2021), which involved a large cohort of healthy Brazilian women and found that excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) was observed in 30.1%, 30.7%, 56.4%, and 46.2% of underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese women, respectively [2]. According to the IOM guidelines, gestational weight gain (GWG) recommendations decrease when body mass index (BMI) increases.",4a619bd1-2071-4b94-b015-97aedf7c5a23
22,methods25," Thus, obese women should gain less weight than overweight and normal weight women, but the guidelines do not provide specific recommendations for women with pregestational DM [6].  In this context, Siegel et al. (2015) found no difference between body mass index (BMI) classes to gain less, within, or above the IOM recommendations in a sample of women with pregestational DM but noticed a higher risk for macrosomia (aOR 4.02; CI 95% 1.16–13.9) and large-for-gestational-age infants (aOR 3.08; CI 95% 1.13–8.39) in women who gained excessive weight compared to women who gained weight within the recommended amounts, even after adjusting for pregestational body mass index (BMI) [46]. The results from the study by Egan et al. (2014) were similar, reporting that excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) in women with pregestational DM was a risk factor for macrosomia (aOR 3.58; CI 95% 1.77–7.24) and large-for-gestational-age infants (aOR 3.97; CI 95% 1.85–8.",0304d8cc-8992-4741-a618-9daae8b275d4
23,methods26,"53), but they found more women with overweight or obesity presenting with excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) than non-excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) (44% vs. 27% for overweight and 37% vs. 25% for obesity; p < 0.01) [3].  We found that the number of years living with DM was a risk factor for progression to excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), but older age (≥32 years) was a protective factor, which appears controversial. The studies by Egan (2014) and Siegel (2015) did not find any association between age and excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) [3,46], but in a cohort of 8184 healthy Brazilian women, the gestational weight gain (GWG) decreased as the age increased [2].  A longer time of living with DM is expected in women with type 1 DM, who usually have lower pregestational body mass index (BMI) compared to those with type 2 DM [47].",39c70d3f-ffa4-46da-899d-fa92593e26dd
24,methods27," Given our results for the effect of pregestational body mass index (BMI) on excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), it seems contradictory. However, the type of DM was not a risk factor for earlier excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) in our sample. Therefore, we suggest that longer years of living with DM may impact the metabolic and behavioral factors influencing gestational weight gain (GWG) not covered in the present study.  Only one participant had yellow skin. This woman was overweight before pregnancy and had the highest gestational weight gain (GWG) in our sample (28.2 kg). Therefore, even though we had found the yellow color of the skin to be a risk factor for progression to excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), we considered that it cannot be properly interpreted or discussed, as it was an isolated case with a very wide confidence interval. Three women who had excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) in our sample reported the color of the skin as unknown.",82a5aa9d-0556-42b4-b3c5-521fa53d6c62
25,methods28,"  A meta-analysis comparing the prevalence of excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) among racial/ethnic groups found that White women were more likely to exceed the IOM guidelines than their Asian and Hispanic counterparts, but White and Black women had a similar prevalence of excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) [48]. Differences in the gestational weight gain (GWG) regarding the color of the skin are often related to socioeconomic discrepancies [48]. We found a marginal effect of inadequate housing conditions on the risk of earlier excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), but it was not statistically significant.  Of the nine women with hypothyroidism included in our sample, eight had excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), with a risk more than four times higher than that of women without hypothyroidism (aHR 4.37, CI 95% 1.62–11.77; p = 0.00). Collares et al.",b1489f3a-4e98-4977-a78d-1108d8ec3cbc
26,methods29," (2017) found that higher maternal TSH and lower free T4 levels in early pregnancy were associated with a higher gestational weight gain (GWG) [49]. Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder that occurs during pregnancy [50]. In our sample, all women diagnosed with hypothyroidism were treated with oral repositioning of the T4 hormone and had adequate hormone levels at the time of inclusion in the study; however, monitoring adherence to treatment and hormone levels during pregnancy was outside the scope of this study.  Identifying risk factors for earlier exceeding gestational weight gain (GWG) and implementing a dietary intervention to mitigate it may help decrease the related adverse outcomes. The sooner the excess weight is present, the more that the metabolic effects can harm the mother and fetus [51].",8751d1d3-b0dc-4449-9834-aa9303f3ce2c
27,methods30," Of particular interest for pregnant women with DM is that an increase in maternal fat mass during early pregnancy can increase insulin resistance and thus worsen glycemic control [52]. As excess gestational weight gain (GWG) does influence offspring obesity over the short- and long-term [53], faster fist and second trimester gestational weight gain (GWG) but not third trimester was associated with higher mid-childhood adiposity in a cohort of 979 mother–child pairs from whom children were evaluated between 6.6 and 10.9 years of age [54].  Our study is novel in terms of several relevant characteristics. First, we investigated candidate genetic risk factors for progression to excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), and we did not find previous studies with this objective.",7ec1e6e2-cca3-4f09-bbbf-1c51daa3b4ef
28,methods31," Second, we investigated the influence of obesity-related polymorphisms in Brazilian women with pregestational diabetes since studies enrolling Brazilian pregnant women in this field are scarce and were not designed for women with DM. Additionally, women were administered two distinct types of diets, and we noticed that it had no effect on the risk of progression to excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) in our sample.  However, this study had some limitations. First, we had a limited sample size to include in these analyses because the clinical trial was originally designed to analyze the effect of the two types of diets on perinatal outcomes without making use of the nutrigenetics approach. Given the increasing evidence regarding the effects of genetic characteristics and gene-diet interactions on body mass index (BMI) and obesity predisposition, we considered that it should gain more attention in the field of maternal and child nutrition.",dc44ab46-b2f8-43a9-90f0-8600335378a1
29,methods32," Therefore, we believe that this study will contribute to paving this way.  Furthermore, we had to make adaptations to maintain the study when the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. We used telemedicine to complete the follow-up of six women (8.6% of the sample) who were already enrolled in the study at the beginning of the pandemic quarantine. The same study protocol was used for the present visits. Prenatal visits to the physicians were maintained at the local level of the study, maintaining the measurements of weight at each visit. We also asked the participants to send a photograph of the prenatal card containing this information using a popular free smartphone application. Once the pandemic quarantine began, we did not include more participants in the study.  5.",708f8e85-7a04-4fe4-9744-5d32e1d60363
30,methods33," Conclusions  In this study, we investigated obesity-related polymorphisms in FTO and ADRB2 genes as candidate genetic risk factors for excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) in pregnant women with pregestational DM using traditional or Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets.  Regardless the type of diet, the AT carriers of rs9939609 (FTO gene) had more than twice the risk of earlier exceeding gestational weight gain (GWG) compared to the TT genotype, and the AA carriers of rs1042713 (ADRB2 gene) had almost four times higher risk than the GG carriers. The frequencies of these genotypes in our study population were 48.6% and 11.4%, respectively.  We found no effect of the genotypes of rs17817449 (FTO gene) and rs1042714 (ADRB2 gene) on the risk of progression to excessive gestational weight gain (GWG); however, the AG carriers for FTO haplotype rs9939609:rs17817449 had almost twice the risk of earlier exceeding gestational weight gain (GWG) compared to TT carriers.",7891238e-32a2-4e1b-bc9c-33767b1107ef
31,methods34," Non-genetic characteristics associated with the risk of progression to gestational weight gain (GWG) were time living with DM ≥ 8 years, pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity, and previous hypothyroidism. In contrast, age ≥ 32 years old was a protective factor.  Identifying women at a higher risk for exceeding gestational weight gain (GWG) earlier may help improve nutritional interventions to mitigate this risk.
