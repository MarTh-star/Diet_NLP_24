0,methods0," SuperWIN was a randomized, parallel-assignment, active-control, efficacy trial. For the protocol and statistical analysis plan, refer to Supplementary Notes 1 and 2. The study was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03895580). The University of Cincinnati (UC) Institutional Review Board approved the protocol, and all participants gave written informed consent. All participant visits were conducted across 13 Kroger supermarket locations in Ohio and Kentucky, each of which had a clinic that allowed for study visits and assessments. The authors vouch for the accuracy of the data, as well as for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol. A detailed description of the methods of this trial has been published10.  Participants  All participants were required to have a primary care clinician at UC Health. Lists of UC Health patients likely to meet the eligibility criteria (for example, diagnosis code of hypertension) were generated from UC Health’s Clarity Database (Epic Systems Corp.",2580f327-9ccd-40ce-88ae-98fee10dd157
1,methods1,"). The UC study coordinator then mailed study materials to those patients living near the study stores. Phone calls, texting, emails and flyers were also used. Interested patients were phone-screened by the coordinator and, if eligible, were entered into the run-in period. Men and women aged between 21 and 75 years were eligible if they were the primary food planner for their household, were an existing shopper at one of the study Kroger supermarkets, were able to shop and prepare food independently and had a home computer (Supplementary Table 4). Participants were enrolled if they had at least one CV risk factor: (1) systolic blood pressure (SBP) >130 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >80 mmHg and/or treatment with an antihypertensive medication; (2) obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥30kg m–2; and/or (3) non-HDL-C ≥130 mg dl–1 and/or treatment with a lipid-lowering medication.",faa0cab3-334b-48cf-8012-bf8eb7027873
2,methods2," Key exclusion criteria included current treatment with another dietary or weight loss intervention, use of Kroger’s online shopping platform within 12 months, previous use of Kroger’s dietary counseling services, baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥190 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥110 mmHg or non-HDL-C ≥190 mg dl–1. All participants provided verbal consent to enter the run-in period and written informed consent at the beginning of the first study visit. Participants were eligible to receive up to two incentives of US$25 throughout the trial.  Randomization and blinding  Following a run-in period consisting of collection of baseline dietary intake via phone, and survey information via email, participants attended a study visit at their assigned store location. All study visits were conducted in the store by a supermarket registered dietitian (‘study dietitian’) (Supplementary Table 5).",5fa05630-06c0-4302-9041-1ef6d3de9fe8
3,methods3," At the end of visit, once eligibility and interest were confirmed, participants were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to: (1) individualized, in-store nutrition education (Strategy 1); (2) individualized, in-store nutrition education enhanced with online technologies and training (Strategy 2); or (3) no further education (control). Randomization was accomplished by the study dietitian using the preloaded, stratified randomization list in the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) randomization module, which programmatically displayed the assignment. Randomization was stratified by characteristics reported to influence food choice: age (two levels), gender (two levels) and household size (three levels). The block size used was five.",4f07e7a9-bf67-4ad0-b3aa-d69235d7cf4f

Raw dietary intake data were not stored in REDCap. All calculations of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score during follow-up and changes in dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score were performed only after completion of the study.  Procedures  All participants received a 30-min medical nutrition therapy session (standard of care) at the first study visit, before randomization. The dietitian educated participants on the evidence-based dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet in relation to CV risk factor reduction, set personal dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary goals based on current intake and developed an action plan to meet those goals.",89c5d738-b0d5-42ac-ba3c-33d3559e1279
5,methods5," Compared with typical practice, this session was enhanced by displaying each participant’s baseline dietary intake data (collected during the run-in period) via simple figures and tables. These highlighted the participant’s mean servings of each dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) food group, the mean serving goals per food group, the specific foods consumed, as well as the time and location of consumption. dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) food serving goals were established based on a caloric goal for either weight maintenance or loss.  Participants randomized to Strategies 1 and 2 were scheduled for six additional in-store educational sessions performed at 2-week intervals over the next 3 months. Educational visits in Strategies 1 and 2 utilized the physical supermarket environment (‘teaching within the aisles’).",05c5a037-3000-484a-b4a0-d3e3cb0c5d3b
6,methods6," Strategy 2 participants were also trained by the study dietitians in a stepwise manner on the store’s online shopping platform, free home delivery services and two other healthcare applications (Supplementary Table 6). Nutrition education themes, learning outcomes and skill-building exercises were consistent across Strategies 1 and 2. Education in Strategies 1 and 2 was guided by dietitian and participant review of each participant’s updated, individualized, Kroger purchasing data (automatically collected via a store loyalty card) at the beginning of each session. These data, displayed via simple figures and tables, highlighted the purchases of food groups and specific food items, as well as counts of purchases and money spent since randomization.  All randomized participants were scheduled for in-store study assessments (interviews and biometric measurements) at baseline and at 3 and 6 months from randomization.",275bb5af-7cf9-40ac-82ef-f6e12ed6b3cc

Endpoints  The primary endpoint was change in dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score, which was calculated on a 0–90-point scale24 with a higher score indicating greater adherence to a dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet (Supplementary Table 7). In this trial, dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score was calculated from 11 component scores based on the alignment between actual intake and the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) serving recommendations (for example, whole grains, vegetables, fruits).  At baseline and at 3 and 6 months, three 24-dietary phone recalls (two weekday and one weekend) were collected at each time point by trained dietary interviewers from the Bionutrition Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and Medical Center (CCHMC).",74cead16-9980-41d0-ac7e-fbe8c7a9b611
8,methods8," Only after completion of the study were these raw dietary intake data used to calculate dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) scores. dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) scores were first calculated for individual recalls followed by calculation of a participant’s mean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score at each time point. Use of dietary intake recalls, collection on multiple days and a comprehensive scoring system to reflect the multiple components of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) were used to optimize measurement of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern adherence.  Prespecified secondary endpoints included systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body mass index (BMI), non-HDL-C, total cholesterol and TG measured during study visits by the study dietitians at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.

Statistical analyses  We evaluated change in dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score within each group from baseline to 3 months and from baseline to 6 months. We formally tested two hypotheses in hierarchical fashion: (1) whether, from baseline to 3 months, Strategies 1 and 2 combined increased dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score compared with an enhanced control; and (2) whether, from baseline to 3 months, Strategy 2 increased dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score compared with Strategy 1 (see above).

25,discussion1," Even during the disruption of the pandemic6,7, visit attendance and data collection remained comparable to prepandemic community-based studies8.  Globally, suboptimal diet is accountable for more deaths than any other risk factor across age, sex and socioeconomic status9. While the scores used to measure dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) adherence have varied across studies, the association between dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) scores and clinical outcomes has been consistently demonstrated10. As an example, a recent meta-analysis found a linear dose–response for each five-point increase in dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score and associations with lower all-cause, cardiovascular (CV), stroke and cancer mortality of 5, 4, 3 and 3%, respectively11.",3779e93a-0b05-487c-90ba-62bbae24cc28

In SuperWIN, the interventions increased dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score by a clinically meaningful 4.7 points from baseline to 3 months compared with the control group. The control group experienced a 5.8-point increase in dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score, which is larger than the change in dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) (or dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) food group) adherence for standard-of-care interventions reported in other recent clinical trials24,25.",53622564-114a-4833-923b-1199244dbb27
29,discussion5," It is likely that the standard of care delivered in SuperWIN had a more favorable impact on dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) adherence due to the use of the participants’ preferred stores, dietitians’ expertise and provision of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)-focused dietary intake data.

In addition, utilization of mobile health-focused applications in patients with CV risk factors is increasing27. In SuperWIN, the addition of online technologies increased dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score by a clinically meaningful 3.8 points from baseline compared with education that did not incorporate them. Considering that SuperWIN enrolled a ‘late tech-adopters’ population, it is possible that early tech-adopters may experience even greater dietary improvements.

In the overall cohort, secondary endpoints of blood pressure, lipids and body mass index (BMI) were not improved by the interventions compared with the enhanced control. However, as an example, systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased by −6.6 and −5.7 mmHg at 3 months in the Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 arms, respectively, while systolic blood pressure (SBP) remained decreased by −5.2 and −4.2 mmHg at 6 months in the Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 arms, respectively.

32,discussion8," More research will be needed to quantify the impact of these interventions on secondary outcomes.  Our trial has certain limitations. Our cohort was receiving routine primary care and was predominantly middle-aged, female, married or living with a partner and living in households with a reasonable total annual household income (for comparison, in 2020, median US household annual income was US$69,560 (ref. 31)). The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically not only impacted clinical trials but also shopping behavior and many other aspects of our participants’ lives (for example, work, childcare). In terms of evaluation of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and lipid changes, we did not collect data on medication doses at any time point. In addition, medication use was assessed by a survey rather than by a rigorous evaluation by the study dietitian. We also did not collect medication use at 3 months.",084bfc0a-358b-4217-849b-a505a63eac74
33,discussion9," We performed a limited number of BP measurements at each time point, which may have curtailed precision. Collectively these limitations, as well as the baseline levels in this cohort, may have reduced our ability to more rigorously assess changes in these secondary endpoints. In future, additional components (for example, exercise interventions, detailed medication assessments, medication titration or medication adherence counseling through the retail pharmacy) may be combined with ‘SuperWIN-like’ dietary interventions to target these outcomes.  In conclusion, all three study groups had higher dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) adherence at 3 months, which persisted until the final study assessments at 6 months.",4a732c9b-4410-4665-aca2-9cca2c51cf74
34,discussion10," Individualized, in-person, dietitian-led nutrition education focusing on the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern, guided by electronic food-purchasing data and delivered within each participant’s home supermarket, increased dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) adherence. The addition of technologies for online shopping with both grocery pick-up and home delivery options, as well as food comparisons and meal preparation, increased dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) adherence. More research will be needed to better understand the effects of these interventions on downstream secondary outcomes. These findings demonstrate the importance of sponsored research with the retail industry, the opportunities to enhance dietary quality through grocery stores and retail clinics, as well as the efficacy of specific types of new interventions.
