0,methods0,"2.1. Database This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2013. We performed secondary analyses of an existing, de-identified, and public-use database that was generated from combining multiple waves from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Initiated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)) National Center for Health Statistics (National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) is a series of nationally representative surveys that used multi-stage, stratified sampling designs to assess the health and nutritional status of civilian, non-institutionalized adults and children in the United States.",e5d67fb9-c511-4372-9e1f-34a2d8bccc1e
1,methods1," Details of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) design, methodology, and procedures are provided on the following website: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm. Demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health data were collected by trained staff in a mobile examination center (mobile examination center (MEC)) or during in-home visits. Anthropometric, physiological, and laboratory measurements were collected for all, or in some cases, a sub-group of study participants. The original National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) protocol was approved by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Institutional Review Board, with written informed consent obtained from all study participants, whereas the current study was determined as being research not involving human subjects [20].",97477063-c29d-4d67-8b09-0de1ee7d2321
2,methods2," For these analyses, we combined the 2001–2002, 2003–2004, 2005–2006, 2007–2008, and 2009–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) waves whereby the C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) level, a marker of inflammation and a key component of allostatic load, was assessed, and we subsequently applied a series of selection criteria to fulfill the study purpose.  2.2. Study Sample A total of 52,195 participants from the 2001–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) were enumerated in the initial sample. Of those, 22,650 (43.4%) were adults ≥ 30 years of age. After excluding participants with a history of cardiovascular disease and cancer, a total of 17,571 (77.6%) adults ≥30 years remained in the study sample.",0d83a49c-55f4-43aa-95fd-bfb9abbc1473
3,methods3," Furthermore, we sequentially excluded participants on the basis of the following criteria: C reactive protein (CRP) ≥10 mg/dL (n = 1642); extreme levels of energy consumption (<400 kilocalories or >5000 kilocalories) (n = 948); died within the first year of follow-up (n = 134); missing data on main exposure variables (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and its components, allostatic load score) (n = 3217). The resulting study sample consisted of 11,630 (66.2%) participants, of whom 2525 (21.7%) had missing data on the covariates, and 9105 (78.3%) had no missing data on covariates and was accordingly labeled as the complete subject database. The exclusion of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) participants with C reactive protein (CRP) > 10 mg/dL was intended to reduce confounders related to the presence of inflammatory diseases that may affect dietary patterns, as well as mortality risks.",fba4093b-1ca4-4fe0-9b98-a00a07268ca0
4,methods4," Assuming data were missing at random and using non-missing data on age, sex, and race, multiple imputations (k = 10) were performed for 2525 with missing data on specific covariates (education, marital status, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, self-rated health, body mass index (BMI)), resulting in a final analytic sample of 11,630 participants (Figure 1). Mediation analyses were based on the complete subject database, whereas the remaining analyses were based on the imputed database.   2.3. Measures 2.3.1. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Dietary Pattern The 2001–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) included a dietary history component whereby a 24-hour recall was administered by trained interviewers in the mobile examination center (MEC), and dietary intake data were collected using computerized techniques. Subsequently, nutrient intakes were estimated by linking dietary intake with corresponding U.S.",3c9bfdc9-ef96-4145-b2a2-bd5dff860989
5,methods5," Department of Agriculture nutrient databases [17].  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern was designed to provide 6–8 servings of grains, 4–5 servings of vegetables, 4–5 servings of fruit, 2–3 servings of fat-free or low-fat milk products, ≤6 ounces of meat products, 4–5 servings of nuts, seeds, or legumes, 2–3 servings of fats and oils, and <5 servings of sweets and added sugars each week [16]. The majority of similarly conducted studies [1,2,4,5,6,7,11,13,15,16] have operationalized the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern by calculating a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score based on consumption of eight food categories, as proposed by Fung and colleagues [21], namely, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy, whole grains, sodium, sweetened beverages, as well as red and processed meats.",a312e217-3b72-4c6f-8b89-a56b7f399d20
6,methods6," Specifically, participants in the highest quintile of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy, and whole grains received a score of 5, and those in the lowest quintile received a score of 1, whereas participants in the highest quintile of sodium, sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats received a score of 1 and those in the lowest quintile received a score of 5 [21]. Participants in the intermediate quintiles received intermediate scores. The score for each component was summed to get an overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score that ranges between 8 and 40 [1,2,4,5,6,7,11,13,15,16,21].",7215215a-a036-4411-9d25-ce11c27dc5a1
7,methods7,"   Since the purpose of this study was to elucidate the biopsychosocial mechanism underlying the diet-mortality link and for consistency with previously conducted studies using National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), we operationalized the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern using a methodology developed by Mellen and colleagues [17], which is solely based on nutrients and has been previously utilized in the context of 24-hour dietary recall data collected by National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) [4,14,16,17]. A total Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score or Mellen index that ranges between 0 and 9 was computed based on absolute targets for nine nutritional components (total fat, saturated fat, protein, fiber, cholesterol, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium) while assuming a 2100 kilocalories diet for both sexes.",e2a3c59f-e711-4a9e-bfa5-141b02c16b77
8,methods8," For each of the nine Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) components, study participants who met the specified goal received 1 point, whereas those who met an intermediate goal received 0.5 points and those who met neither goal received 0 points. Furthermore, we dichotomized the total Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score such that participants who met approximately half of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) targets (score ≥ 4.5) were considered consistent with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern [4,14,16,17] (Table S1).  2.3.2. Allostatic Load Selected variables from the 2001–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) examination and laboratory modules were used to evaluate allostatic load.",050fab2d-a90b-43ca-b9e4-39b7593d3874
9,methods9," Allostatic load has been previously conceptualized as the outcome of cumulative effects of repeated or chronic exposure to chemical and non-chemical stressors that result in a shift from a normal to an adaptive but dysfunctional state which can negatively impact physical and mental health [18,19]. Previously, Thomson and colleagues [19] described an Allostatic Load Index (Allostatic Load Index (ALI)) as a composite score ranging between 0 and 9 using thresholds or percentiles of selected biomarkers (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), resting heart rate, C reactive protein (CRP), and serum albumin), with higher scores indicating worse allostatic load.",f190ed77-f860-461c-bf97-61d0698875c5
10,methods10," The 2001-2010 waves of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) data lacked the anthropometric measurement of hip circumference; therefore, we adopted the definition of Allostatic Load Index (ALI) as described by Rodiqeuz and colleagues [18]. Specifically, high-risk (coded as 1), moderate-risk (coded as 0.5), and low-risk (coded as 0) categories were generated for the following nine allostatic load components: systolic blood pressure (SBP): ≥150 mmHg [1], 120 to <150 mmHg [0.5], <120 mmHg [0]; diastolic blood pressure (DBP): ≥90 mmHg [1], 80 to <90 mmHg [0.5], <80 mmHg [0]; body mass index (body mass index (BMI)): ≥30 kg/m2 [1], 25 to <30 kg/m2 [0.5], <25 kg/m2 [0]; HbA1c: ≥6.5% [1], 5.7% to <6.5% [0.5], <5.7% [0]; total cholesterol: ≥240 mg/dL [1], 200 to <240 mg/dL [0.5], <200 mg/dL [0]; high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol: <40 mg/dL [1], 40 to <60 mg/dL [0.5], ≥60 mg/dL [0]; total/high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio: ≥6 [1], 5 to <6 [0.",d157c09f-b536-4660-9dd4-0907ad62147e

A total score ranging between 0 and 9 was obtained for the Allostatic Load Index (ALI) by adding unweighted component scores (Table S2).   2.3.3. All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality The primary outcome was all-cause mortality rate, and secondary outcomes were cardiovascular disease and cancer-specific mortality rates. Vital status and person-months of follow-up were obtained from the linkage between baseline National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) databases and the National Death Index death certificate data. To date, mortality follow-up is complete until 31 December 2015. The ICD-10 codes for the underlying causes of death variable were used to define cause-specific mortality rates.",bd55b7d0-bfbd-41c9-ad7e-df17a6f23cce
12,methods12," Specifically, cardiovascular deaths included diseases of the heart (I00–I09, I11–I13, and I20–I51) as well as cerebrovascular diseases (I6–I69), whereas cancer deaths included malignant neoplasms (C00–C97).   2.3.4. Covariates Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics included age (in years), sex (Male, Female), race (Mexican American, Other Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Other), education (less than high school, 9–11th Grade, High School Graduate/General Education Development or Equivalent, Some College or AA degree, College Graduate or above), marital status (married/living with partner, other) and poverty income ratio [PIR] (<100%, 100%–<200%, ≥200%). Lifestyle characteristics were defined as the smoking status (non-smoker, ex-smoker, current smoker), alcohol consumption [≥12 glasses in the past 12 months] (yes, no), and physical activity [walking/bicycling, tasks around home/yard, moderate activity or vigorous activity in the past 30 days] (yes, no).",dc79fe68-35a6-4cb9-8fb9-4c9b20d6ce01
13,methods13," Finally, health characteristics were defined as weight status based on body mass index (BMI) categories, and self-rated health (self rated health (SRH)). The body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2) and categorized using to the World Health Organization definition of weight status, namely underweight/normal weight (body mass index (BMI): <25 kg/m2), overweight (body mass index (BMI): 25–29.9 kg/m2), and obese (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2). The self rated health (SRH) was based on a single general health questionnaire item, namely, “Would you say your health, in general, is excellent, very good, good, fair or poor?” and further categorized as “excellent/very good/good” versus “fair/poor”.   2.4. Statistical Analysis All analyses were conducted using STATA v. 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and the 2001–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) recommended mobile examination center (MEC) sample weights.",5599ab1c-a2e3-466d-9a13-bb592c70517d
14,methods14," Continuous variables were summarized as mean ± standard error of the mean (standard error of the mean (SEM)), whereas proportions were calculated for categorical variables. First, fully-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health characteristics as predictors of all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates. Second, fully-adjusted linear and logistic regression models were constructed for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle and health characteristics as predictors of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, defined as a continuous or categorical (<4.5 vs. ≥ 4.5) outcome. Third, fully-adjusted linear regression models were constructed for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health characteristics as predictors of allostatic load score.",6f5e4958-c318-4697-bdb4-4d97956edbd4
15,methods15," Fourth, fully-adjusted linear regression models were constructed for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and its component scores as predictors of allostatic load index score. Fifth, we performed Cox proportional hazard regression analyses to evaluate the main and interactive effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (or its component scores) and the Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score in relation to all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates. All statistics, including means, proportions, standard error of the mean (SEM), beta coefficients (β), odds ratios (OR), and hazard ratios (HR) with their 95% CI were estimated taking complex sampling design, as well as imputations into consideration.",576c4455-a2c9-48c3-b57b-6db63808de1a
16,methods16," Finally, using the complete subject database and not taking complex sampling design into consideration, we applied the ‘paramed’ method to estimate the controlled direct effect, the natural indirect effect and the total effect (with their 95% CI) that correspond to the paths (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet → allostatic load → mortality), while adjusting for years of follow-up, as well as demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health characteristics. The ‘paramed’ method performs causal mediation analysis using parametric regression models. Two models are estimated: a model for the mediator conditional on exposure and covariates, and a model for the outcome conditional on exposure, the mediator and covariates. It extends statistical mediation analysis (known as Baron and Kenny procedure) to allow for the presence of treatment (exposure)-mediator interactions in the outcome regression model using counterfactual definitions of direct and indirect effects.",f4bae55c-ca1f-49cf-88d9-ea531b6803e9
17,methods17," The ‘paramed’ method is a user-written STATA package which was based on the MEDIATION macros in the SAS and SPSS that were developed by Valeri and VanderWeele [22]. It allows continuous, binary or count outcomes, and continuous or binary mediators, and requires the user to specify an appropriate form for regression models. These analyses resulted in slope ‘estimates’ with their 95% CI that corresponded to beta coefficients when the outcome was continuous and log OR when the outcome was dichotomous. Two-sided statistical tests were performed at α level of 0.05.  3. Results A total of 11,630 2001–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) participants (48.5% male) with mean (±standard error of the mean (SEM)) age of 48.78 (±0.23) years and mean (±standard error of the mean (SEM)) body mass index (BMI) of 28.59 (±0.09) kg/m2 were evaluated in this study, with mean (± standard error of the mean (SEM)) follow-up time estimated at 112.27 (±1.11) months or 9.35 (±0.",bb57834f-7662-46f1-85fb-e368f0850ae5

As shown in Table 1, 72.9% were non-Hispanic White, 82.7% had completed high school education or better, 71.5% were married or living with a partner, 72.8% had PIR ≥200%, 52.9% had never smoked, 65.8% had consumed ≥12 glasses of alcohol in past 12 months, 61.1% were not physically active, and 16.2% had fair or poor self rated health (SRH). All-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer-specific mortality rates were estimated at 6.5%, 1.1%, and 1.9%, respectively. Due to complex sampling design, 10,822 of the 11,630 participants (93.0%) were included in multivariable analyses described in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5. Multivariable analyses using Cox proportional hazard models suggested that older age, male sex as well as fair/poor self rated health (SRH) were positively associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates, whereas “Other” (vs. “Mexican American”) race was positively associated with all-cause but not cause-specific mortality rates.",e9ef118b-9de6-4709-9224-cc1f5f84929d
19,methods19," Being married or living with a partner and PIR ≥200% (vs. <100%) were negatively associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease-specific mortality rates, whereas being an ex-smoker or current smoker was positively associated with all-cause and cancer-specific mortality rates. Finally, non-alcohol drinkers (<12 vs. ≥12 glasses in the past 12 months) were at increased risk of dying from cancer, but not from cardiovascular disease (Table 2).  The mean (±standard error of the mean (SEM)) Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was 3.26 (±0.021), and the median (range) Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was 3 (1–8), with 78.3% scoring less than 4.5 on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern. Similarly, study participants had a mean (±standard error of the mean (SEM)) of 2.82 (±0.02) and a median (range) of 3 (0–9) on the Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score.",c04fad80-23b3-4818-9f55-44dada54a56d
20,methods20," Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses suggested that older age and female sex were associated with higher scores whereas higher education, PIR ≥ 200%, ex-smoker or current smoker status, physical inactivity, and greater body mass index (BMI) were associated with lower scores on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern. Multiple linear regression analyses suggested that Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score was positively associated with age, body mass index (BMI), current smoking, no alcohol consumption, as well as fair/poor self rated health (SRH), whereas female sex, college graduation, and PIR ≥200% were negatively associated with Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score (Table 3).  Linear regression models for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and its components as predictors of Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score are presented in Table 4, before and after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health-related confounders.",425ccff8-ea3e-4c33-ae6a-850f1ab33944
21,methods21," In unadjusted models, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and most of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) components (except for protein, potassium, and sodium) were significantly and negatively associated with the Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score. By contrast, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and two Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) components (fiber and magnesium) remained significantly and negatively associated with Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score, after adjusting for confounders.   Moderating effects of the Allostatic Load Index (ALI) on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet-mortality relationships were evaluated in Table 5. The results suggested that Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score was positively associated with all-cause mortality rate but not a cardiovascular disease or cancer-specific mortality rates, after controlling for confounders.",3aaccd63-b077-4638-ab42-1c00f06a2679
22,methods22," Furthermore, Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score remained positively associated with all-cause mortality, when the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score or its components were entered into the model. By contrast, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was not significantly associated with mortality rates, either before or after Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score was entered in the model. There were no statistically significant interaction effects between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Allostatic Load Index (ALI) scores in relation to all-cause or cause-specific mortality rates, suggesting the absence of moderation by Allostatic Load Index (ALI). Similar results were obtained when Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score was entered along with each of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet components in multivariable models, with the exception of protein and potassium.",1217dd35-eaba-4cd1-adcd-c457fe98ca6e
23,methods23," Specifically, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) protein score was inversely related to all-cause mortality, independently from Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score and baseline confounders. Also, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) potassium score was directly related to all-cause mortality, independently from Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score and baseline confounders. Interestingly, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) potassium score (but not the Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score) was inversely related to cardiovascular disease-specific and directly related to cancer-specific mortality rates, in fully-adjusted models that include interaction terms.   Mediating the effects of the Allostatic Load Index (ALI) on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet-mortality relationships were evaluated in Table 6.",9a108f84-536a-4304-a06e-5cb9f0238fba
24,methods24," The total Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and most of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) component scores, including saturated fat, protein, fiber, calcium, potassium, and sodium, were directly but not indirectly related to all-cause mortality. Whereas potassium was positively associated, the other Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were negatively associated with all-cause mortality rate. By contrast, the total Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and specific Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) component scores (saturated fat, total fat, cholesterol, fiber, magnesium) were indirectly associated with cardiovascular disease-specific mortality rate through the Allostatic Load Index (ALI). Finally, there were no direct or indirect relationships between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and cancer-specific mortality rate.   4.",c83f6cfa-8842-47b1-b2b1-d8e120334c49
25,methods25," Discussion In this secondary analysis of survey data, adult National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) participants with no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline were followed-up for an average of ~9 years, and inter-relationships among Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, allostatic load, and mortality rates were evaluated. Consistent with past studies [4,5,9,14], all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer-specific mortality rates were estimated at 6.5%, 1.1%, and 1.9%, respectively, and in line with current evidence, the majority of U.S. adults were not adherent to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet despite recommendations [17]; in fact, 78.3% of study participants reported Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score <4.5. Also, the mean Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score was 2.8, consistent with figures reported by Rodriquez and colleagues [18].",25e30061-0ca3-4e4f-80e6-4a56ca8c8354
26,methods26," Generally speaking, demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health-related risk factors for mortality and the Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score were as expected, although negative relationships between socioeconomic indicators (e.g., education, PIR) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet necessitate further investigation.   Whereas Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) total score and two-component scores (fiber and magnesium) were negatively correlated with Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score, these same dietary factors were not significantly related to all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates, either before or after controlling for Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score. By contrast, two Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) component scores (protein and potassium) were significantly related to mortality rates, independently of Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score.",11127dab-773d-4558-af99-1c8d64aa2c76
27,methods27," Whereas all-cause mortality was negatively related to high protein score and positively related to high potassium score, cardiovascular disease-specific mortality was negatively related, and cancer-specific mortality was positively related to potassium score. In contrast, Allostatic Load Index (ALI) score was positively related to all-cause but not cause-specific mortality rate, independently of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score or its component scores. These findings did not translate into significant moderation effects, although mediation of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-mortality relationship by Allostatic Load Index (ALI) was observed in the context of cause-specific mortality. Specifically, Allostatic Load Index (ALI) scores appear to mediate associations of cardiovascular disease-specific but not cancer-specific mortality with total and selected Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) component scores.",bdc0a02b-424e-47c1-a8d8-91d947dc70c3
28,methods28," It is worth noting that many of these nutrients were previously tested as non-pharmacological treatments for hypertension, similarly to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [12].  The negative association between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and Allostatic Load Index (ALI) aligns with current epidemiologic research. Studies focusing on female healthcare professionals found an association between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and incidence of cardiovascular disease—the top two quintiles of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) were associated with 36–41% reduced hazards of cardiovascular disease, and multivariate analysis showed 12–23% risk reduction. However, adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) was not associated with a risk of venous thromboembolism in the same group [10].",d35b940a-28ff-4931-b2e1-5a6afe8ac0b3
29,methods29," In another study evaluating a single versus a combination of dietary nutrients, like Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), it was shown that the combination diet had greater success in the management of hypertension, as compared to single nutrient. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet with low sodium or with weight loss regimen was as effective as single-drug therapy for the treatment of hypertension [12]. There is evidence of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)’s cardio-protective effects in the U.K. population as well. Subjects with the most Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-concordant diets had a 20% reduced incidence of stroke, 13% decreased the total incidence of cardiovascular disease but no change in the risk of coronary heart disease [15]. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet education to stroke patients or patients at risk for stroke was found to be beneficial in another cohort [16].",5ad8145d-2f72-46f8-bcbe-5a77c251fc7d
30,methods30," Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet adherence was also found to lower incidence of heart failure by 22% in older Swedish men in the highest Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) quartile [13]. Moreover, adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in women with a relative risk in the highest quintile of 0.8 for total colorectal cancer and 0.81 for proximal colon cancer [6].   The finding that specific Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) components, but not the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern, may affect the risk of dying from any cause, is consistent with some but not all previously conducted studies.",97e5a3b8-1e15-480d-b143-0998ebb755a8
31,methods31," In fact, several studies found a beneficial effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on all-cause mortality [2] as well as mortality related to multiple chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, hypertension [8,14], chronic heart failure [13], renal failure [5], stroke [16] and cancer [7,23,24]. For instance, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) was associated with reduced mortality in healthy middle-aged people, with 20% improvement followed by a reduction in mortality between 8 and 17% [11]. In another study, maintaining a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-like diet was associated with reduced risk of total death, gastrointestinal cancers in men, and lower non-gastrointestinal cancers in women [25].",504b72b0-e5b2-4bba-8e0f-7f2838ac3f4e
32,methods32,"   It is worth noting that several of the previously conducted studies examined the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet in relation to mortality among individuals with chronic diseases or risk factors for chronic diseases at baseline. In one study, higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were associated with a modest decline in mortality in postmenopausal women with heart failure [25]. Adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) was associated with a 43% lower risk of renal function decline and a 48% reduction in all-cause mortality in adult renal transplant recipients [1]. Furthermore, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) was associated with lower all-cause mortality in hypertensive adult patients [24], and improved Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were found to be associated with decreased mortality in metabolically obese but normal-weight adults [4].",c7eed9d7-f897-4110-84e9-92d6d2e48b5b
33,methods33," A high-quality Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was also inversely associated with overall mortality and cancer mortality among cancer survivors [3]. Despite the overwhelmingly significant associations between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and mortality, a few studies reported differently. In studies that examined the relationship between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and mortality, no association was found between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) quality and long-term hypertension or cardiovascular disease mortality in female holders of Iowa driver’s license [26] or decreased cardiovascular or total mortality in heart disease patients, whereby adjusted HR for cardiovascular mortality was 1.19 and HR for all-cause mortality was 1 for highest Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) tertile [5].",dab997ae-cd3a-4eb1-943e-f2fefa6ac444
34,methods34,"  To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the mediation of the relationship between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and mortality by allostatic load using the “paramed” method. The observed mediating effects of allostatic load on the relationships between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and mortality rates imply that allostatic load may be used as a surrogate measure in future prevention trials involving the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or its components. From a public health standpoint, prevention of cardiometabolic risk factors that constitute the allostatic load through a dietary modification that is consistent with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is likely to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease-specific deaths, but not cancer-specific deaths.",09419198-4508-4ea5-90a4-7d17545bdf29
35,methods35," The findings pertaining to specific Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet components (especially protein and potassium) require further investigation and replication by others.   Nevertheless, study findings should be interpreted with caution and in light of several limitations. First, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and allostatic load were measured simultaneously, precluding establishment of temporal relationships between these exposures. Similarly, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was evaluated using a single 24-hour recall and calculated using nutrients rather than food items. This may have affected observed relationships between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, allostatic load, and mortality rates.",c64c95ce-4d2c-469f-99a7-850e52c148c3
36,methods36," Third, despite the exclusion of subjects who died within one year of follow-up limiting reverse causality, the maximum follow-up time varied substantially among National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) participants from distinct waves, potentially affecting the relationship of exposures with the risk of death. Fourth, many of the covariates adjusted for in multivariate analyses can be considered as time-varying, and, in the absence of repeated measurements could only be assessed once in the context of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) surveys. Fifth, secondary analyses were performed using existing data which may have limited the ability to ascertain certain characteristics, thus leading to selection or misclassification bias. For instance, a history of cardiovascular disease and cancer were self-reported and could not be ascertained through medical records.",d7988d7e-f5d6-4df3-80a8-0e79aed0a3ce
37,methods37," Also, data were assumed to be missing at random, and despite multiple imputation the role of selection bias cannot be eliminated. Sixth, the observational nature of this study may have led to residual confounding by unmeasured or inadequately measured confounders. Seventh, sub-samples of the 2001–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) participants had valid data on exposures and outcomes of interest, potentially leading to selection bias. Eighth, although a relatively large study sample was analyzed, the role of chance cannot be entirely accounted for in the presence of multiple testing. Of note, with ten exposure variables (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) total score and nine component scores) and three outcome variables (all-cause, cardiovascular-specific, and cancer-specific mortality rates), similar hypotheses were tested 30 times, potentially reducing alpha to 0.002 per hypothesis after Bonferroni correction.",a157a59e-fdec-43ed-8c54-b72ef8b752c4
38,methods38," Finally, study findings can only be generalized to U.S. adults, 30 years and older, and future research is needed to confirm study findings in a wider population that includes children, adolescents, and young adults.  In conclusion, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, fiber, and magnesium were negatively correlated with allostatic load, whereas allostatic load predicted higher all-cause mortality, irrespective of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Whereas protein was protective, potassium increased the risk of all-cause mortality, irrespective of allostatic load. Furthermore, potassium was protective against cardiovascular disease-specific mortality and a risk factor for cancer-specific mortality.",1ffdafbc-ac11-4033-97ca-3167c3cf1f90
39,methods39, Significant mediation by allostatic load on cardiovascular disease-specific mortality was observed in the context of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) total score and selected Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) component scores. Further research is needed to confirm and elucidate these preliminary findings.  ,ab489ccd-29d2-4136-affd-ec4e843383fe
