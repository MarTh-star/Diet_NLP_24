0,background0," Numerous factors such as nutrition and diet can affect the quality of sleep of people, especially employees. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between university employees' sleep quality and their dietary quality scores (Healthy Nutrition Index (HEI), Diet Inflammation Index (DII) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score).  ",d4308b73-cd83-4f9f-a66f-22a8ab9eca67
1,methods0," Food Frequency questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) was used to assess their food intake and Pittsburgh questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality. Their initial information was also recorded and their height and weight were measured. Then, through Generalized Additive Models (GAM) analysis, the relationship between sleep quality scores and nutritional indicators was determined. The detailed methods and of this study are given below.  Participants: Among 525 employees, 431 filled the consent form. Therefore, 275 of them had complete diet data, however after considering total energy intakes within the range of 800–4200 kcal, then 211 of participants was taken into the final analysis. Cluster random sampling from different departments in university. Participants' information was kept strictly confidential.",d522d9f6-7c11-43e5-93b9-83fd35d06274
2,methods1,"  This descriptive-analytic study was conducted on 211 employees using cluster random sampling from different departments in Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, aged between 18–50 who met the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were willingness to participate in the study and age between 18–50 years. The exclusion criteria were reluctance to participate in the study, history of chronic disease, following vegan diet, pregnancy and lactation, taking certain medications.  The sample size was determined based on BMI (mean = 28.9 and SD = 4.5) as the primary outcome from a study conducted by Muscogiuri et al.(18);  The sample size was calculated using single population formula and assuming α = 0.05 and confidence level of 95% as 162 subjects. Considering the withdrawal rate of 35%, 218 subjects were recruited.  Anthropometric and physical assessment: Body weight and height was measured in the participants.",b67c89c3-9625-424e-ac00-3e171d74134d
3,methods2," Body weight was measured using a Seca scale, with an accuracy of 100 grams. Height was measured using a Seca stadiometer with an accuracy of 0.5cm. then BMI was calculated by dividing body weight by the height square.  Dietary assessments: The used food intake was obtained from the participants, by trained dietitians, through a structured interview. To determine typical food intakes, a valid and reliable 147- item semi quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) with standard servings was used(19). the intake frequency of each food item was asked on a daily, weekly or monthly basis during the past year, and converted to the gram. Total energy and nutrient intake were then calculated using Nutritionist IV software as modified for Iranian foods.  Diet Inflammation Index (DII) score: For developing the latest Diet Inflammation Index (DII), the relationship between food components or parameters and specific inflammatory markers was reviewed in the literature, published in 2010.",2d7038c1-7bab-41a1-9d74-7cd03f6b971c
4,methods3," Each article was assigned a positive or negative value, based on the effect of the food parameter on inflammatory markers (+1 = pro inflammatory relationship, 0= no significant relationship with inflammatory markers, -1 = anti-inflammatory relationship). Based on the number of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory articles, an inflammatory effect score for each food parameter was calculated. First of all, each participant's dietary intake was linked to the global dataset, for calculating the Diet Inflammation Index (DII) score. Then the mean intake for each of the 45 food parameters was provided (12).",5fd33ca5-d10b-4991-8e5c-2db5c46557b4
5,methods4,"  Healthy Nutrition Index (HEI) calculation: By summing the sub scores in 13 categories, the total Healthy Nutrition Index (HEI) score is calculated: (the score range in parentheses): total vegetables (0–5), greens and beans (0–5), total fruit (0–5), whole fruit (0–5), whole grains (0–10), total dairy (0–10), total protein (0–5), seafood and plant protein (0–5), fatty acids (0–10), sodium, refined grains (0–10), and “empty” calories from solid fats, alcohol, and added sugars (0–20). A better score, shows a better dietary quality (20).  Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score calculation: Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, reward points for high intakes of five food groups, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds and legumes, low-fat dairy products and whole grains, according to quantiles ranking (i.e.",9a4a63c1-5195-4a85-900a-95bd48ac5b1a
6,methods5,", participants in the lowest quintiles receive 1 point, those in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quintiles receive 2, 3, and 4 points respectively, and the highest quintiles, 5 points). Intakes of sodium, sweetened beverages, red meat and processed meat had the lowest score (i.e., the lowest quintiles are assigned 5 points and the highest quintiles, 1 point) (21).  Sleep quality measurements: To assess the sleep quality, The Pittsburg questionnaire (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) was used. The Pittsburg questionnaire has 7 scales that include mental quality of sleep (ration of duration of useful sleep from time spent in bed), sleep disorders (waking up at night), dose of medicine measures sleep deprivation and dysfunction. The score of each scale is between 0–3 and the score of 3 in each scale determines the maximum negative. The overall score of this questionnaire is 0 to 21 and the overall score of 6 and above indicates the inadequacy of sleep quality.",03294a16-d7b8-4401-a4ae-d090c13029b2
7,methods6,"  Statistical analysis: Distributions of demographic, lifestyle behaviors, and dietary characteristics were compared across sleep quality score and time in bed (hr/d). Hence, we used chi-square test for categorical variables and one-way ANOVA test for continues variables.  The Generalized Additive Models (Generalized Additive Models (GAM)) procedure was applied to the dataset of 211 without any missing data by smoothening the effect of covariates into crud and adjusted models. Moreover, the adjusted Model include age, sex and total daily energy intake.  Generalized Additive Models (GAM) uses a link function to establish a relationship between the mean of the response variable and a smoothed function of the explanatory variable(s).  We used SPSS version16 and R version 3.6.2 to perform the analyses. P values <0.05 were considered significant. The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) analysis and nutrients were estimated using NUT IV software (Nutritionist IV).",856e5a43-58f0-4eac-9da4-bdd393f1068b

10,discussion0," In the present study, the relationship between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Diet Inflammation Index (DII) and Healthy Nutrition Index (HEI) score with sum sleep and time in bed was assessed, in the employees. The results of the present study showed that there is a positive association between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and time in 21bed; also, there is a strong negative association between Healthy Nutrition Index (HEI) score and sum sleep, and a strong positive association between Healthy Nutrition Index (HEI) score and time in bed. But we noticed a positive association between Diet Inflammation Index (DII) score and sum sleep. It means that by increasing Healthy Nutrition Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, sleep quality increases, but by increasing Diet Inflammation Index (DII) score, the sleep quality decreases.",0f8a1d52-c9bb-4f7b-9d61-f5955ae0a0a7
11,discussion1," There are several studies that have surveyed the relationship between sleep quality and diet quality.  Similar to our study, Liang et al. In a study of 3941 American adults found that following a dash diet could effectively improve sleep quality and sleep duration(22). Also, similar to our study, Mossavar-Rahmani in a study of 2,140 Spanish adults found that increasing the Healthy Eating Index effectively increased sleep duration and sleep efficiency(23). Also, another study conducted on 1500 adults in Spain, showed a lower variation in sleep duration, in the individuals, adherent to the Mediterranean diet(24) and the results of this study were in line with the present study. Another study conducted by Jaussent et.al found a positive effect of Mediterranean pattern on specific aspects of sleeping(25). Consumption of fruits, legumes, nuts and fish is an important factor in the indication of Healthy Eating Index and following a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet(21).",ee97d7ac-982e-4020-94e7-a5eeeab55e71
12,discussion2," Various studies have shown that these factors can be effective in improving sleep quality. Jyväkorpi et al. Showed that eating vegetables helps to sleep better(26). Hakkarainen et al. Also showed that people with insomnia eat less vegetables(27). Kurotani et al. And Cao Y et al. Showed that consumption of vegetables, fruits and legumes is associated with better sleep quality(28). Liang et al. Also found that reduced consumption of vegetables, nuts, and legumes was associated with reduced sleep duration(22). Other studies also confirm that consumption of fruits and vegetables is directly related to sleep duration and sleep quality(24).  In addition, del Brutto et al., Showed that fish consumption can be effective in improving sleep duration(29). Kurotani et al., Also showed that fish consumption can reduce the PQS (poor quality of sleep) score(28) and nutrition showed that fish is related to sleep timing(30).",b21528a3-b24f-4398-89e9-9e4786e7ad32
13,discussion3," And all the factors mentioned above, are parts of Healthy Nutrition Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and the present study expressed that higher Healthy Nutrition Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores improved sleep quality.  Refined grains, Sodium, Added Sugars and Saturated Fats are factors that reduction of their consumption can increase the score of the Healthy Eating Index(21). Sodium is also important in determining the score of dash diet(31). Mossavar-Rahmani et al., showed that among the components of AHealthy Nutrition Index (HEI)-2010, decreased sodium intake was most strongly associated with higher sleep efficiency (23). Grandne et al., indicated that sugar consumption was directly related to poor sleep quality(32). Jyväkorpi et al., Also showed that consumption of Sugars and Saturated Fats are associated to poor sleep quality(26).",5c5771ae-d819-47cd-8005-262004375229
14,discussion4," Moreover, other animal and small human experimental studies have shown that high-saturated-fat diets may influence in circadian rhythms(33).  In a recent study by Lopes et al, it was shown that the Diet Inflammation Index (DII) score was only positively associated with daytime sleepiness as a component of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)(34). In the study by Godos et al., participants in the highest quartile of Diet Inflammation Index (DII) score were more likely to have poor sleep(35).  An interventional study also showed that an anti-inflammatory diet including increased intake of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and reduced intake of added sugars and SFAs could improve sleep quality(36).  There are some possible explanations for the mechanisms underlying the inverse association between sleep quality and the healthy pattern, one of the explanations is that proteins include tryptophan that is a component of serotonin production and neurosecretory hormone melatonin.",4c73880f-a3d4-4d5b-b910-73bd435d9459
15,discussion5," sleep cycle, either directly or indirectly, and brain function is controlled by Serotonin. Generally, serotonin promotes wakefulness, also regulates sleep through changes in the concentration of melatonin. Melatonin exerts a hypnotic effect through thermoregulatory mechanisms by lowering the core body temperature, reducing arousal and increasing sleep-propensity(37).  Also, vitamin B6, pyridoxine, is required for the synthesis of serotonin from tryptophan. The 5-Hydroxytryptophan is an intermediate in this process, and is converted to serotonin by a pyridoxal 5′-dependent enzyme. In relation, dietary niacin is involved in leaving more tryptophan to be used for the synthesis of serotonin.  In addition, folate is involved in the metabolism of monoamines like serotonin in the brain. The N-3 fatty acids are required to convert serotonin to melatonin by the enzyme arylalkylamine-Nacetyl transferase (38).",0db51dda-100f-45bd-8088-e6d700374b2f
16,discussion6,"  Other nutrients such as Magnesium enhances the secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland by stimulating serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity, which is the key enzyme in melatonin synthesis(39). In addition, oxidative stress can lead to insomnia. Diets with rich in antioxidant vitamins including vitamin C, have a high score of the healthy dietary pattern, which may decrease the levels of oxidative stress and prevent the development of DIS. Therefore, the above-mentioned nutrients or their combination might have a beneficial role in initiating sleep.  Increased Healthy Nutrition Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores are associated with increased protein intake resulting in increased tryptophan. Diets with higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Healthy Nutrition Index (HEI) score, contain more dark green vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds(20, 21).",56efc4b7-e47a-487b-8a7f-54a008eee339
17,discussion7,"  As a result, it increases the intake of magnesium, folate and vitamin C and other antioxidants from the diet, which are important factors in regulating effective hormones in sleep(28). Diets with higher Healthy Nutrition Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores have more variety of foods, and contain whole grains that are high in B vitamins, so they can help individuals with their sleep quality.  Increasing fish intake increases omega-3 fatty acids and B12 intake, which improve sleep quality. B12 increases melatonin receptors in the brain. Fish also contains glycine, which can improve sleep satisfaction.  Decreasing the Diet Inflammation Index (DII) score of a diet indicates the anti-inflammatory properties of the diet, which together with increasing the consumption of nutrients such as magnesium, niacin B6, B12, folate, vitamin C and omega 3, are effective in regulating melatonin(37).",e8cfb646-4f62-4d8c-8349-948f3f9d9a2c
18,discussion8,"  Other anti-inflammatory agents that have been shown to be effective in improving quality and sleep time include potassium, fiber, and calcium(22, 28).  Studies have also shown that some nutrients that have inflammatory properties in the Diet Inflammation Index (DII) index, play an important role in reducing sleep duration and sleep quality. These nutrients include total fat, SFA and cholesterol(40).  One of the reasons that increased Diet Inflammation Index (DII) scores, results in decreased sleep quality, may be because of the increase in CRP levels, that is related to increased sleep apnea. Also, researchers have found that inflammation and inflammatory factors are positively linked to oxidative stress; these factors include advanced-glycation end products like erythrulose that decreases sleep quality.",fbf302be-7c01-4390-8a1b-a98d9423c19a
19,discussion9,"  One of the strengths of this study is that no such study has been conducted in the south of Iran, about dietary scores and sleep quality, also no study has been done to evaluate the food and nutrition of employees and that the results of this study provide conditions for other studies. But there are limitations to this study, too. We could not cover different ethnicities and our sample size was limited to Jundishapur University and other university centers in the province were not surveyed; also, the sample size of the study reduced the original sample size by excluding very high and low calories.  The results from this study showed that there is a significant relationship between dietary health scores, such as Healthy Nutrition Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and sleep quality derived from PQSI in staff of AJUMS.",d60d6238-5e09-4bd3-9f87-cc6bcdabacfd
20,discussion10," Also, the results showed that increasing Diet Inflammation Index (DII) score, which is caused by increasing the consumption of inflammatory foods, reduces the quality of sleep. This study was the first study that investigated the relationship between dietary quality indices and sleep quality in Ahvaz. The results can help the employees to change their diet and lifestyle and can avoid inflammatory diets to improve their sleep for more accurate performance. We suggest other researchers to conduct other studies with a larger sample size and different population so that the results can be assigned to other populations.
