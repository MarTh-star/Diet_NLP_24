0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Population  This study was a randomized Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH)-diet-controlled trial (randomized DASH diet controlled trial (RCT)) that was performed from March 2019 to September 2020. All subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Soochow University (project identification code: ECSU-2019000148). The clinical trial registration number for this study is ChiCTR2000033987. All participants signed a written informed consent form. Eligible participants were randomly and blindly allocated to the intervention (dietary fiber, DF) group or the control group using computer-generated random numbers and accepted the 3 months intervention period. Before the intervention, all participants had a 1-week washout period to reduce the effect of background diets on this study.",37a4dd24-17f3-4c27-a860-a57115f535ec

Participants whose oat bran intake < 4 d/w during intervention in the intervention group were excluded.  2.3. Sample Size Calculation  We did not find a similar study of exploring the effect of DF-supplement on lowering heart rate in patients with hypertension. Before commencing the research, we designed a pre-experiment with 10 participants and calculated the sample size on the basis of the results of the pre-experiment. The mean difference and standard deviation (SD) of office heart rate at the end of the intervention between the two groups were 4 and 5 bpm. With α = 0.05, power = 0.85, we calculated 28 patients for each group. In view of the sample loss of 20%, the number for each group was 34.",a41cc83e-b67e-4015-9c98-cf29f0239ee7

Control Group  According to The Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension in China (2018 Revised Edition), a usual dietary program education (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet, Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH)) for patients with hypertension [26] was recommended to the control group at participants’ first visit. The Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is rich in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, whereas the saturated and total fats were quite low [27].  2.4.2. Intervention Group  On the basis of the dietary education of the control group, patients in the intervention group were delivered oat bran of 30 g/d (DF content: 8.9 g/d with a vacuum packing). The oat bran was provided by Fuzhiyuan company, Xinji, China.",04e49a34-e947-4e3a-81ff-1d7089202cb9

If there were any adverse reactions, the participant was advised to inform the researchers immediately.  2.5. Follow-Up  Using face-to-face communication, WeChat, and cellphone, a 3-month follow-up was conducted in this study. The frequency was as follows: once a week in the first month, once every two weeks in the remaining two months. During the follow-up, the researcher assessed the patients’ diet, BP, exercise, and medication change. For the intervention group, the number of bags (30 g/bag) of oat bran consumed each week and side effects of oat bran were collected. Participants whose diet did not meet the requirements of the dietary program (oat bran intake < 4 bags per week) during intervention were excluded from the study.  2.6.

8,methods8," The quality of sleep was scored by a Visual Analog Scale according to participant’s perception. The scores less than 3 were classified as poor sleep quality, 4–6 as fair sleep quality, and more than 7 as good sleep quality [28]. Constipation was assessed with the validated Rome III criteria (straining (≥25%); lumpy or hard stools (≥25%); sensation of incomplete evacuation (≥25%); sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockade (≥25%); manual maneuvers to facilitate defecations (≥25%) and <3 times/w of defecations) and diagnosed in patients who met at least 2 of the 6 criteria [29]. The exercise referred to engaging in exercises other than daily activities. Exercise less than 3 times a week, less than 20 min each time, and continuous time less than 3 months was considered irregular exercise; otherwise, it is exercise [30].",6f4adcbb-b058-441e-9c0a-76e92297905c

They were selected via tick boxes by patients. Comorbidity referred to the co-existence of one or more diseases or clinical conditions and is independent of blood pressure [32]. When the patient cannot determine whether his disease was a complication, the research team asked the patients of medical history to make a decision.  2.7.2. Diet and Oat Bran Consumption Record  A three-day diet diary was used to assess the quantity of participants’ DF and other nutrient intake. At baseline and 3 months, the researchers educated participants to record 3 days (2 working days and 1 weekend day) of detailed dietary consumption at home.",c306c012-a72c-4113-ae96-2205ed1e693f

Industrielle Entwicklung Medizintechnik, Stolberg, Germany), which can not only take BP measurements but also HR measurements, the data of 24 h HR was collected. HR was measured once every 30 min at night from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. and every 20 min during the day time from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. [33]. The criteria for valid HR were based on the criteria for valid BP (at least one BP measurement per hour successful recording of ≥80% of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during both the daytime and nocturnal periods), as well as valid range of HR from 20 to 250 bpm [34].",d9d31e24-c201-4340-9688-dfac024f118f

Finally, there were 33 participants in the intervention group and 30 in the control group (Figure 1). The patients in the intervention group were mainly male (78.8% vs. 53.3%), and the differences of baseline characteristics in other variables were not significant between the two groups (Table 1).  On the basis of the analysis of the food diary, the nutrients consumed at baseline were compared between the two groups. There were no significant differences in daily energy and nutrient (except DF) intake between the two groups at baseline (p > 0.05), which is shown in Table 2.  3.2.

17,methods18," Side Effect of Dietary Fiber  During follow-up, we did not find any side effects or symptoms due to oat consumption among the participants.  4. Discussion  An increased heart rate can be an independent cardiovascular risk factor [35], while dietary fiber is reportedly inversely associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease [36] and mortality from cardiovascular disease [37]. In this study, we explored the association between dietary fiber and heart rate, and the results confirmed the beneficial effect of dietary fiber supplement in lowering heart rate in patients with essential hypertension, which may contribute to the decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.  4.1. General Data  A total of 63 patients with hypertension were recruited for this study, and the average age was 40 years (DF group (40.09 ± 9.32) years, control group (40.80 ± 10.94) years). A total of 78.8% of the participants in the DF group were males, compared with 53.",47453fec-0988-4fde-8558-f06f8cf3645e
18,methods19,"3% in control group, which is consistent with the investigation report of hypertension epidemiology in China [2]. The average body mass index (BMI) of participants in the DF group and control group were (24.93 ± 3.12) kg/m2 and (25.38 ± 4.83) kg/m2, respectively, indicating that most participants were overweight, which may be related to no exercise or low exercise intensity. Rong et al. [38] pointed out that overweight is a common risk factor for hypertension, which is consistent with our study. While the duration of hypertension was about 1.6 years, 96.7% of patients had no complications, up to 33.3% of patients took anti-hypertensive drugs, and most patients had good blood pressure control.",7212fb10-b436-401a-bbb5-8ca7309d198b
19,methods20," Smoking and drinking are risk factors for the occurrence of hypertension [39], and most participants kept the habit of non-smoking and non-drinking, which may have been due to the fact that young patients who are more educated have a better ability to learn and can change their behavior, which may worsen the disease process [40].  4.2. Compliance to Dietary Fiber Intake  The recommended quantity of dietary fiber by the World Health Organization is (25~35) g/d [35]. However, with increasing economic development, the increased consumption of energy-dense and processed foods has led to a reduced consumption of dietary fiber. The quantities of dietary fiber intake in previous studies were far below the recommended doses. Liu et al. [41] conducted an investigation that showed that the average daily dietary fiber intake of hypertension (HTN) patients was 11.25 ± 4.88 g, which is consistent with the study by Qi et al. [42], who found that the average daily DF intake was 10.17 ± 4.",2dafdab3-2f3f-4e40-bc0b-5337137a9de9
20,methods21,"38 g in hypertension (HTN) patients. In this study, hypertension (HTN) patients were provided with oat bran supplements, ensuring a daily consumption of DF of 21.45 ± 3.86 g/d. In addition, we found that there was an average of 6.2 bags/w of oat consumption. On this basis, we analyzed the effect of dietary fiber supplement on heart rate lowering.  4.3. Dietary Fiber on Heart Rate  Compared with office heart rate, ambulatory heart rate can provide more valuable information for the clinic, including circadian variation of heart rate, heart rate variability, nocturnal heart rate, and avoidance of white-coat effect [43]. In this study, we used ambulatory heart rate as the primary outcomes of study and analyzed the effect of dietary fiber on lowering 24 h average, maximum, and minimum heart rates. In addition, we explored the impact of dietary fiber on heart rate during daytime and nocturnal heart rate.  4.3.1.",3a1a70cd-b3fd-445b-b50f-8410fdb076df
21,methods22," Dietary Fiber on 24 h Heart Rates  24h maxHR is an important reference when determining maximal work capacity and maximal oxygen consumption [5], while 24h aveHR is an independent and effective predictor of increased risk of ischemic events, sudden death, and cardiovascular death in patients with cardiovascular disease [44]. Kolloch et al. [45] reported that the primary end point events, including death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, increased by 6% for each 5 beats/min increase in heart rate. Similarly, Lonn et al. [46] indicated that for every 10 beats/min increase in heart rate, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality increased by 12%, 18%, and 15%, respectively. In this study, we found that after oat supplementation for three months, the 24h maxHR slowed down by 9.79 ± 18.96 bpm, while it was only 1.50 ± 12.88 bpm in the control group (t = −2.009, p = 0.049).",676b269b-bdcb-4168-96c4-c2a9020d75b1
22,methods23," At the same time, the result of within-group comparisons in the intervention group showed that after intervention, 24h aveHR decreased by 4.12 bpm (p = 0.022). While we did not find similar differences in the control group, the possible mechanisms might be that dietary fiber can modulate human gut microbiota and result in an increased short chain fatty acid (short chain fatty acid (SCFA))-producing bacteria, which was confirmed by our previous study [23]. Xue et al. [23] conducted a randomized control trial using oat supplementation for three months in patients with hypertension, and the results indicated that Bifidobacterium (p = 0.019) and Spirillum (p = 0.006) were significantly increased. short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s include several carboxylic acids such as butyric acid (BA) produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers [47]. Increased short chain fatty acid (SCFA) may influence the circulatory and the nervous system functions [48].",f57de4f0-3bfb-4ffb-8a94-7d0fc2f80eef
23,methods24," A pre-clinical study found that BA administered into the colon of rats produced prolonged decrease in HR [47]. An increase in the concentration of BA in the colon produces a significant hypotensive effect that depends on the afferent colonic vagus nerve signaling and GPR41/43 receptors, inhibiting the release of renin and thus playing a crucial role in regulation of HR [49,50]. Vagal afferents also express receptors that can sense short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s, providing another pathway for the HR-modulating effects of short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s [50]. In addition, short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s, in particular butyrate, have anti-inflammatory effects that are presumed to be mediated by inhibition of histone deacetylase (histone deacetylase (HDAC)), which may decrease HR [51].  4.3.2.",e3e59606-eabe-4258-b155-6c8324a051c6
24,methods25," Dietary Fiber on Daytime and Nighttime Heart Rates  Alterations in heart rate in individuals showed circadian variations, manifested by a relatively fast heart rate during the day and a slow heart rate during the night, which are mainly regulated by the neurohumoral system [52]. Gut microbiota also has circadian rhythmicity and can mediate the effects of disruption of circadian rhythms on human health [53,54]. Furthermore, dietary fiber can modulate gut microbiota and thus may further adjust variation of heart rate contributed to by circadian rhythms. In this study, after three months of oat bran intervention, D-aveHR, D-minHR, and D-max HR in the DF group decreased by 5.00 bpm, 3.64 bpm, and 8.97 bpm, respectively, while nighttime HR showed an insignificant decrease.",05358ede-bfd5-4022-ac52-40f609395dd7
25,methods26," The reason might be that autonomic nerves are hyperexcitable in the daytime [52], which may increase the expression of receptors such as GPR41/43, and the increased short chain fatty acid (SCFA) by dietary fiber supplement may interact with them, and thus the daytime heart rate fall was more pronounced. However, at night, autonomic nerves are in a hypotensive state [52], which may result in limited effect of dietary fiber. In addition, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production is relatively less due to the gut microbiota’s circadian rhythmicity, so the heart rate-lowering effect of DF is not obvious.  4.4. Dietary Fiber on Medication Change  The first choice for drug treatment of hypertensive patients with increased heart rate is beta-blockers, which can slow down heart rate and reduce sympathetic nerve excitability [8].",bf3616fc-40d3-4b17-805e-854f0f4c5c5e
26,methods27," Another common anti-hypertensive drug for hypertension and increased heart rate is calcium channel blockers, with negative muscle strength, negative conduction, and negative frequency, which can slow down the heart rate without inhibiting sympathetic nerves [8]. Moreover, there is ivabradine, which slows the heart rate and basically has no effect on blood pressure [8].  The results of this study showed that no participants in either group used ivabradine. Only 30.3% and 46.7% of participants in the DF group and control group used beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, respectively. On one hand, with the short duration of hypertension, participants tended to control their blood pressure and heart rate with lifestyle changes rather than drug treatment, which is consistent with European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of hypertension.",f0189638-d639-4e85-b8e1-7eadac8d57fe
27,methods28," On the other hand, calcium channel blockers were indicated for elderly patients with hypertension [25], while the average age in this study was around 40 years.  5. Conclusions  On the basis of the results of our study, we conclude that dietary fiber (oat bran) supplementation might be beneficial in lowering HR in patients with essential hypertension and may be a useful strategy of effectively improving HR in patients with hypertension (HTN).  6. Limitations  This study has some limitations. Firstly, the observational period was not long enough to assess the long-term outcomes that may have resulted from dietary fiber supplementation. Therefore, further long-term clinical trials are needed to verify the relationship between dietary fiber supplementation and heart rate. Secondly, our study addressed the association between dietary fiber intake and heart rate, and did not discuss the influence of different dietary fiber doses on heart rate.",01d96833-7bc2-418d-a05d-9ac828821614
28,methods29," Therefore, more studies are needed in the future to address this aspect. Finally, further analysis of the characteristics of hypertensive people who do not respond to DF in lowering heart rate and finding the influencing factors is recommended. ",ad2b9c72-3691-4419-a3e7-ce742d4bbde5
