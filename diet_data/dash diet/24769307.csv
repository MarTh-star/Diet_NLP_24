0,introduction0," Diets that are consistent with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH))6 are associated with reduced cardiometabolic risk and better health outcomes. The design of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is rich in plant foods and low-fat dairy products and relatively low in fats and sugars, was predicated on the notion that the health-promoting effects of diet arise from the overall diet rather than from individual foods or nutrients (1). In randomized trials, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary patterns were shown to lower blood pressure in persons with hypertension and prehypertension, even without sodium reduction (2, 3). The beneficial effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet were observed within 2 wk and, when combined with sodium reduction, were similar in magnitude to the results of pharmaceutical trials (1).",dd3b5a5e-9da9-4004-ae61-c78cebdb32c4
1,introduction1," Observational studies found associations between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-accordant diets and reduced weight gain (4), lower incidence of stroke (5), heart failure (6), and fatal cardiovascular disease more generally (7). Accordance to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) was also associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (8) and colorectal cancer (9).  The characteristics of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet that promote health may also have implications for its environmental impact. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and other plant-centered diets may be an important and effective way to reduce the production of greenhouse gases (GHGs) associated with food consumption. Most of the climate impact of food production is due to methane (emitted by ruminant animals during digestion) and nitrous oxide (released from the land during tilling) (10).",b1b46caa-e082-4668-a155-0ab34c2905e6
2,introduction2," Over a 100-y period, methane is 25 times more potent a GHG than carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide is 300 times more potent (11). Research on the relation between diet and GHGs is in its infancy, but modeling studies have suggested that reducing consumption of meat and other animal-derived foods can simultaneously reduce the GHG impact of the diet and reduce risk of chronic disease (12, 13).  The potential population health and climate-related cobenefits of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet provide sound justification to promote the diet’s wider adoption, but several barriers may exist to its uptake. In particular, the adoption of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets may be affected by food prices.",40fc6a1b-2893-4db9-a1c6-367e4581eb2d
3,introduction3," A recent study found that for most adults in the United States, consuming a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-accordant diet was associated with higher dietary costs (14), which is broadly consistent with earlier work reporting that healthier diets tend to carry a price premium (15). Identifying affordable healthy diets is an important step toward increasing the wider adoption of dietary recommendations.  This study combined dietary data with food-level GHG and price data to examine the GHG impact and cost of diets in relation to their accordance to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet pattern in a large, population-based sample of adults in the United Kingdom.

4,methods0," Subjects We used data from the population-based European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort study in Norfolk, United Kingdom (EPIC-Norfolk). Recruitment was based on registers of general practices in the county. Participants were aged 39–79 y at the time of entry (1993–97), when they were weighed and measured and completed questionnaires and dietary assessments. Of the 25,639 adults recruited at baseline, our analyses were restricted to the 24,293 participants who had valid dietary data (described below). Volunteers received no dietary counseling or advice in this observational study. All volunteers gave written informed consent, and the study was approved by the Norwich district ethics committee.  Dietary assessment Participants reported their usual food intake during the previous year by completing a 130-item, semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) described previously (16).",49fbf0b4-4106-4444-8d40-a187dd754a8e
5,methods1," Intake for each item was reported in frequencies ranging from “never or less than once/month” to “6 times per day or more.” The servings were specified in terms of units or common portions (e.g., one apple, one slice of bread) or household measures (e.g., glass, cup, or spoon). Further questions allowed us to categorize breakfast cereals consumed for the purpose of estimating overall consumption of whole grains. Similarly, questions on milk allowed us to estimate intakes in the low-fat dairy category of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data were processed by using the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) EPIC Tool for Analysis (17), software based on the earlier analysis system (16), to estimate average daily nutrient and energy intakes.",0247f5ba-4688-4f52-a6fc-0bc4a56547e3

For further details on the nutritional analysis of the EPIC food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), see Welch et al. (16).  Accordance to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern Accordance to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern was based on a score similar to one previously applied to the Nurses’ Health Study food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (5). That score was based on consumption of 8 food groups and nutrients, adjusted for energy. The original food groups and nutrients used were fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy, red and processed meats, sweetened beverages, and sodium.",223f2f7b-c0c5-4bb3-b4bc-e33a85687425

Calculation of dietary GHG emissions For each of the 289 food codes represented in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)’s food and nutrient database, we estimated the GHG emissions, measured as kg of CO2 equivalents (CO2eq), as the quantity of 3 GHGs weighted by their global warming potential over a 100-y period. The GHGs were carbon dioxide (weighted as 1), methane (weighted as 25), and nitrous oxide (weighted as 298), per 100 g of food. This method was adapted from a previous investigation of the health impact of applying a carbon tax to foods in the United Kingdom (18). The source document for GHG parameters was Audsley et al.",0dfcfa79-d53b-417e-a5da-0da3e75bf49d
10,methods6," (19), which estimated comparable GHG emissions for 94 food commodities consumed in the United Kingdom. These estimates incorporated the life cycle of food commodities from the earliest stages of production to the retail distribution center. The GHG emissions for the 289 food codes were then constructed from these 94 parameters by using representative ingredient lists and adjustments for density, and the diet-level variable derived was kg CO2eq/d. More details on the mapping of GHG values to the foods in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) instrument are provided in the Supplemental Materials.  Cost of diets The monetary cost of the reported diets was estimated by attaching a food price vector to the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)’s nutrient composition database as described previously (20). Retail prices for each of the 289 component food items in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were obtained by using standardized and published price collection methods (21).",b107049b-bb98-4baf-93a2-6a445d4be6e3
11,methods7," In brief, each food and drink in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was priced by using MySupermarket.com, a website for comparing supermarket food prices nationwide in the United Kingdom. For each of the 289 items in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), the lowest, nonsale price was selected from among the 5 nationwide retailers represented on the website at that time (June 2012): Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Waitrose, and Ocado, which together had a 68% market share in 2012 (22).  For packaged goods, including most fresh produce, the package size in the middle of the range was typically selected. If only 2 package size options were available, the larger was chosen. As described previously, prices were adjusted for preparation and waste (21) to yield an adjusted food price of £/100-g edible portion. The addition of this new variable to the EPIC-Norfolk food and nutrient database (16) allowed the derivation of dietary cost for each participant.",eac6c41e-6b7e-4b8e-93a1-5a8e2e9d9eb6
12,methods8," The variable associated with each individual’s diet was cost per day (£/d).  Analytic approach We used general linear models to evaluate the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordance score by demographic and socioeconomic strata, which allowed adjustment for age, sex, and dietary energy. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordance by sex was evaluated in models adjusting for age. General linear models were also used to produce covariate-adjusted estimates of GHG emissions and costs of diets by quintile of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordance. In all models, ANOVA was used to detect statistically significant overall heterogeneity across groups. In analysis of quintiles of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordance, trend tests were conducted to test for systematic increase/decrease across groups, and pairwise tests were conducted to examine the difference between extreme groups.",12ed0626-70b8-478a-a7bb-620b12146fa7

Diets in the highest quintile of accordance had a GHG impact of 5.60 compared with 6.71 kg carbon dioxide equivalents/d for least-accordant diets (P < 0.0001). Among the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) food groups, GHGs were most strongly and positively associated with meat consumption and negatively with whole-grain consumption. In addition, higher accordance with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with higher dietary costs, with the mean cost of diets in the top quintile of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores 18% higher than that of diets in the lowest quintile (P < 0.0001).

GHG emissions and dietary cost for each quintile of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordance are shown in Table 3. There was a negative, monotonic association between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordance and GHG impact.

25,discussion0," In this report, we provide evidence from a large, population-based study of British adults that dietary patterns that were more accordant with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet pattern had a lower climate impact, in terms of the GHGs associated with the foods consumed. These findings provide further rationale for promoting the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet more widely in Britain, where prevailing unhealthy diets contribute to excess rates of chronic disease and mortality (23) and where the food system contributes more than one-fifth of all GHGs produced in the United Kingdom (10, 24). Previous reports have pointed to the potential health and climate cobenefits of shifting the population to healthier diets (13, 25–27), but to our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the climate impact of diets in relation to accordance to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary targets.",7ddec60b-78fe-4558-82cd-e54b7d44d661
26,discussion1,"  Not all of the 8 Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) food groups showed a climate benefit. For instance, consumption of diets high in sugar had lower GHG emissions than diets low in sugar (see Table 4). Similar findings have been reported previously (25, 28) and may be because the production of sugar has very low carbon footprint (29), especially when measured per kcal (19). This tension between health and sustainability goals has previously been observed in a study that modeled the effect of a GHG tax and subsidy regimen for foods, which resulted in subsidies for sugar-sweetened beverages and consequent adverse health outcomes (18). Our finding that higher vegetable intake was associated with higher dietary GHGs is consistent with a previous French study showing that some modeled diets with increased vegetable consumption could have higher GHG emissions (30).  Other diet patterns might be associated with even lower dietary GHGs.",91fc6409-e44d-403c-b554-500bf1b73398
27,discussion2," For example, a recent United Kingdom-based study, using similar methods to those presented here, compared meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans (31). Relative to moderate meat eaters, those following vegetarian or vegan diets had dietary GHG emissions that were 1.8 kg CO2eq/d (32%) or 2.7 kg CO2eq/d (49%) lower. A modeling study from the United Kingdom showed that even more dramatic reductions in GHGs were possible if the dietary repertoire was limited to a small number of foods optimized for their nutritional and carbon characteristics (25). By contrast, we found that the most Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-accordant diets were only 1.1 kg CO2eq/d (17%) lower than for the least-accordant diets. The difference in findings indicates that limiting or excluding animal-based foods can result in much lower carbon diets than following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which encourages low-fat dairy and lean meat in moderation (32).",ab16390e-5f84-44a7-886f-e42246183e5b
28,discussion3,"  Nevertheless, the evidence base indicating the health benefits of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet pattern is probably the most robust among dietary patterns, with evidence from clinical trials and observational studies (33). Moreover, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was designed to be largely congruent with US norms of food consumption (32), which might make it more acceptable for the British population than other evidence-based diet patterns such as the Mediterranean and Okinawan diets (33, 34).  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet’s cultural acceptability and its potential to benefit both health and environment are likely to be insufficient to drive its broad adoption. Among the structural barriers to adopting healthier eating habits, the cost of food is significant, particularly in a United Kingdom context, in which food prices rose >30% from 2007 to 2013 (35).",b0e38ee9-35f9-4887-aace-b5fe77f6ead8
29,discussion4," This trend has coincided with deterioration of diet quality, particularly among the lowest income groups (36). In this study, we found that the most Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-accordant diets were 18% more costly than unhealthy diets, with the differential greater for women than for men. This finding is consistent with earlier work indicating a price premium for healthier diets generally (15) and is similar to findings reported in a recent study of dietary intakes in the US population, where the most Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-accordant diets were 19% more costly than the least-accordant diets (14).  Our analysis of the dietary costs of accordance to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) food groups is consistent with previous studies, which have found that diets higher in fruit and vegetables and lower in sugar were more costly (37–40).",cbf2245a-640a-45f3-b7b5-81fa532dc9c2
30,discussion5," We also found that improving accordance to the nuts and legumes food group was associated with only a modest increase in dietary costs, which is consistent with an earlier US study that suggested that increasing intake of this food group could be an economical way to improve overall diet quality (39). The consistent finding that healthier diets tend to carry a price premium highlights the need to identify components of healthy diets that can be obtained at low cost and to look for ways in which the affordability of healthy diets can be increased, particularly for those on lower incomes.  Our results indicated that accordance with some Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) targets could be improved with no or minimal additional cost to consumers. For instance, increasing intake of whole grains and lowering intake of sodium appeared to be cost-neutral, and lowering intake of red and processed meat could produce substantial cost savings.",aa14c75c-3d59-4558-b55f-cb23a5f7cae8
31,discussion6," Aligning these findings with the food group–level analysis of GHG impact can reveal where dietary improvements can be achieved both cost-neutrally and with benefit to the environment. Here, we found that improving accordance to 4 of the 8 Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) food groups—by reducing intake of red and processed meats and dietary sodium and increasing intake of whole grains, nuts, and legumes—achieved both ends.  Although modeling studies have demonstrated the feasibility of diets that meet cost, nutrition, and environmental criteria in the United Kingdom (25), a recent observational study identified existing diet patterns that met these criteria in the French population (41). Those diets achieved lower GHGs and cost in part by having lower total energy intake, because energy intake is strongly and positively associated with dietary GHGs [see Vieux et al. (30) and Figure 1].",94e3b793-d00c-43a3-b9b1-e7b308360b2c
32,discussion7," Furthermore, they also emphasized starchy plant-based foods and were lower in energy density, characteristics similar to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) (42, 43). Notably, diets meeting these criteria were 17–19% lower in GHGs relative to the average French diet (41), a difference similar to the one we report between the top and bottom quintiles of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordance. Altogether, this body of literature indicates that shifting population diets to lower their GHG impact may be achieved by both reducing excess energy intake and changing diet composition to strike a balance between health, environmental impact, and consumer costs.  Methodologic considerations and limitations This descriptive study faced a number of limitations, including being based on a cohort of older adults who had limited socioeconomic and demographic heterogeneity.",d1098995-a2ec-42d8-9d0f-e4e2018e2bb8
33,discussion8," Further limitations stem from a reliance on food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s, which have a number of biases (42). There was limited detail in the available food-level GHG data, and confidence intervals in our estimates are likely to be underestimated because uncertainty around the GHG emissions of individual foods was not incorporated into the results. Similar considerations apply to our methods for deriving dietary costs, which were obtained by using retail food price data, an approach described above, that, on average, produces estimates that are lower than actual food expenditures (20). Finally, dietary costs as defined here were only a reflection of the retail price of the foods consumed and did not reflect the potential economic externalities of diet, including (for example) the health care costs to society arising from the consumption of low-price but less healthy diets.",a64e0686-bee2-4c74-a432-d0cb5df3f764
34,discussion9," Despite these limitations, we believe this study represents an important step forward by linking food-level variables with a large, population-based sample to quantitatively examine the environmental and economic implications of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet in the United Kingdom.  Conclusions In conclusion, population-based strategies to preventing obesity and chronic disease need to incorporate the promotion of evidence-based dietary guidance (44). The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is one evidence-based dietary pattern that, if widely adopted, could have substantial beneficial impacts for population health as well as having beneficial effects on diet-related GHG production.",b3cfdb5c-f3e9-418e-bc50-6dc8193d2e79
