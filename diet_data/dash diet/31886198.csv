0,methods0,"2.1 Participants The present parallel randomized clinical trial was performed from March to June 2020. Subjects with hemophilia were recruited from Omid Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. Volunteers were eligible if they (a) were male, (b) were between 10 to 18 years old, (c) had clotting factor (VII, VIII and IX) deficiency, (d) have not used antioxidant supplements within the previous 3 months, and (e) were not on a specific or prescribed diet. Low compliance with dietary intervention and incidence of a new chronic disease during the study were determined as exclusion criteria.  Sample size was determined by n = 2[(Z1‐α/2 + Z1‐β)2 × S2]/ Δ2 where α = 0.05 (type one error) and β = 20% (type two error). Total cholesterol (TC) was considered as the main variable. A previous study demonstrated that the standard deviation of TC in hemophilia patients was 5.3 mg/dl (Özdemir et al., 2020), and the minimal detectable difference of TC was 5 mg/dl.",ed2793e6-603e-437d-a1de-515bbccffe92
1,methods1," Accordingly, the required sample size was 36 for this study. To account for incidence of attrition, 40 hemophilia adolescents were recruited for the current clinical trial. An introductory meeting was set up to explain the aims and details regarding the study, and subsequently, prior to study commencement, adolescents and one of their parents signed informed written assent/consent forms. The Research Council and Ethical Committee of “blinded for peer review” University of Medical Sciences, “blinded for peer review,” “blinded for peer review” and “blinded for peer review” approved this study (Code: “blinded for peer review”). This randomized clinical trial was registered at “blinded for peer review.”  2.2 Study procedure and dietary intervention Adolescents were randomly allocated to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) (n = 20) or control group (n = 20) for 10 weeks. We assigned a code to each child and used SPSS 20 (IBM) for randomization.",d2251ad2-3a2f-4713-86ea-15b966f39539
2,methods2," In the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) group, total energy expenditure was individually calculated using Harris–Benedict equation. The dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet was administered based on a previous modified dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet for adolescents (Couch et al., 2008). Macronutrients distribution was as follows: 50%–55% of energy from carbohydrate, 27%–30% of energy from fat and 16%–18% energy from protein. Daily food menus were designed by emphasizing on consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, low‐fat dairy, and white meat. Also, consumption of red meat and sodium was restricted (Table 1). Daily food menus were explained and taught to adolescents and their parents.",174db7e2-e4f0-49d7-971f-a0ef9fd97534
3,methods3," Patients in the control group received nutritional recommendations, based on healthy eating, including chewing food completely, using low‐volume frequent meals, limiting added fat and sugar, using healthy snacks, drinking adequate water and avoiding deep frying. Previous studies showed that serum vitamin C is a viable biochemical indicator of complying with the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet (Saneei et al., 2014); so, compliance with the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet was evaluated by measuring serum vitamin C at baseline and after 10 weeks of intervention. Adolescents and their parents participated in meetings scheduled at baseline and 2‐, 4‐, 6‐ and 8‐weeks, whilst parents additionally completed a one‐day food record on the 1st, 5th and 10th week of the study (three in total). All collected food records were analyzed by Nutritionist IV using the USDA database.",b9b99af3-04df-4037-8ddd-378c9f71586f

5,methods5," The systolic blood pressure (Systolic blood pressure (SBP)) was determined by the first sound (Korotkoff phase 1), and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) was determined as a fade of the sound (Korotkoff phase 5). The average of two manual measurements was recorded.  2.4 Biochemical assessment A blood specimen was taken after 12 hr of fasting in the early morning. After clotting, samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min to separate the serum. The concentration of blood glucose was measured by an enzymatic colorimetric method based on activity of glucose oxidase enzyme (Pars Azmoon, Tehran, Iran), and serum concentration of triglyceride (TG) and TC was evaluated by enzymatic colorimetric method. After blocking low‐density lipoprotein (low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)), very low‐density lipoprotein, and chylomicrons by antibodies, the concentration of high‐density lipoprotein (high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)) was measured by photometric method.",00434205-d741-4f1e-b3b9-b899e0b81c25
6,methods6," Similarly, enzymatic colorimetric tests were utilized to measure low‐density lipoprotein (LDL), after blocking high‐density lipoprotein (HDL), Vlow‐density lipoprotein (LDL) and chylomicrons.  2.5 Statistical analysis The analyses were performed on the basis of an intention‐to‐treat (intention‐to‐treat (ITT)) approach. Missing values were treated according to linear regression method (Xi et al., 2018). Kolmogorov‐Smirnov test and Q‐Q plot were used to evaluate normal distribution, and results showed that TG was not normally distributed; therefore, it was log transformed. Chi‐square tests were used to compare qualitative variables between the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) and control group, and quantitative variables were compared between two groups using independent Student's t‐test. To adjust for confounding variables (baseline values), we conducted analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).",a11f68ed-ef73-4941-972a-bb203e8c5105
7,methods7," Data were presented as mean and standard deviation, and all data analyses were conducted using SPSS version 20 statistical software.  2.6 Results Among the 40 subjects with hemophilia who enrolled in the study, three patients in the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet group (due to medical condition and personal reasons) and four patients in the control group (due to medical condition and low adherence to intervention) were withdrawn from study (Figure 1). The analyses were performed according to intention‐to‐treat (ITT) approach, and thus, all 40 participants were enrolled in the final analyses. There were no side effects following dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet among the participants.  FIGURE 1 Flow Diagram illustrating participant selection process and study procedure  Table 2 indicates baseline characteristics of study participants in each group.

Between‐group comparison further indicated a significant rise in serum vitamin C levels in the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet group compared to control group (p = .001), indicating good compliance of the participants to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet.  FIGURE 2 Serum vitamin C levels at baseline and end of trial in each group  As demonstrated in Table 4, within group comparison showed a significant reduction in Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (−0.48 mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (−0.48 mmHg), fasting blood sugar (FBS) (−5.86 mg/dl), TC (−16.07 mg/dl), TG (−17.21 mg/dl), and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐C (−9.79 mg/dl) in the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet group.",4ce2a41b-add0-4f28-aced-9548d99d4fe9
10,methods12," Also, a significant rise was seen regarding high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐C (3.39 mg/dl) in the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet group. Compared with the control group, adherence to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet led to significant reduction in Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p = .04), fasting blood sugar (FBS) (p = .004), TC (p = .001), TG (p = .04), and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐C (p = .001), and a significant rise in high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐C (p = .01).

12,discussion0," Dietary modification represents a promising intervention for the management of metabolic risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, in many chronic diseases. Nevertheless, there is no specific dietary recommendation, for patients suffering from hemophilia, to improve their metabolic profile. Indeed, a distinct dearth of nutritional interventions has been carried out in patients with hemophilia; therefore, we sought to assess the effect of the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, as a healthy dietary pattern, on metabolic indicators of adolescents with hemophilia.",fdf88a6a-f46a-4aae-8f68-18e6f8594bae
13,discussion1," According to our findings, compliance with the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, as compared to reception of healthy dietary recommendations, could lead to significant reductions in Systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting blood sugar (FBS), TG, TC, and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐C, and increases in high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐C, after 10 weeks, in adolescents with hemophilia. However, no significant between‐group differences were found for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during the study.  3.1 Blood pressure In contrast to the control group, both Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly reduced in the intervention group. Nonetheless, between‐group differences were significant for Systolic blood pressure (SBP), but not for diastolic blood pressure (DBP).",f8ac5be7-b8b8-4b49-a0cb-278e936b30de
14,discussion2," It seems that Systolic blood pressure (SBP) had a stronger response to dietary sodium and potassium, two nutrients modified in dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, compared with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (Mente et al., 2014). Therefore, it seems that the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet may be more effective for the reduction of Systolic blood pressure (SBP) than diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in normotensive adolescents with hemophilia. In the current evidence base, there is a distinct lack of clinical trials to have investigated the effect of the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet on blood pressure in adolescents. Some of these trials have confirmed our findings, and reported a significant reduction in Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (Couch et al., 2008); although some others have contradicted our findings and reported a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (Saneei et al., 2013).",3074894a-5ab5-41bd-b6f3-e0b91a8721d3
15,discussion3," The discrepancy in such findings may be attributed to differences in methodologies. Indeed, this issue was also mentioned by Bricarello et al. (2018) who recently conducted a systematic review to evaluate the impact of the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet on childhood blood pressure, but could not perform a meta‐analysis. Interestingly, our findings seem to be in line with the findings of similar randomized clinical trials in adults. When the results of clinical trials conducted on adult were pooled in a recent meta‐analysis, it was found that the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet can elicit a greater reduction in Systolic blood pressure (SBP), as compared to diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (Siervo et al., 2015). It was also suggested that diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is mainly reduced by antihypertensive medications, rather than dietary modifications (Neter et al., 2003).",e2085f82-09d0-44f8-ae2d-0c9767cdbe80
16,discussion4," In addition, it was indicated that reductions in Systolic blood pressure (SBP), as well as diastolic blood pressure (DBP), can be more pronounced in individuals with higher blood pressure or higher BMI at baseline (Siervo et al., 2015). Since our subjects did not take antihypertensive medications and had normal blood pressure and BMI values, it is not surprising that following the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet elicited a small, but significant, reduction only in Systolic blood pressure (SBP). Nevertheless, it has been shown that even a minor reduction in Systolic blood pressure (SBP) can effectively decrease vascular mortality (Prospective Studies Collaboration, 2002).  The dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet is rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, whole grains, white meats, and dairy products.",d01939ab-aee6-4865-bcd0-d70b154d7a90
17,discussion5," As a result, it is comprised of numerous blood pressure‐lowering nutrients, such as potassium, nitrate, magnesium, calcium, folate, vitamin C, fiber, and amino acids like arginine (Saneei et al., 2014). However, the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet limits the intake of salt and processed foods, accordingly, it is low in sodium which is a nutrient linked with increasing blood pressure (Bazzano et al., 2013). According to recent meta‐analyses, the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet appears to be the most effective dietary modification for reducing blood pressure (Schwingshackl et al., 2019). Moreover, it seems that this diet may decrease blood pressure through increased renal sodium excretion (Akita et al., 2003), reduction of inflammatory biomarkers (Soltani et al., 2018), elevation of antioxidant capacity (Al‐Solaiman et al., 2009), and improved endothelial function by means of enhanced nitric oxide bioavailability (Lin et al., 2012).  3.",fc20c103-d2b7-480c-92d7-e5103231b8c6
18,discussion6,"2 Blood glucose During our study, fasting blood sugar (FBS) was significantly decreased in the intervention group, but remained statistically congruent in the control group. As a consequence, the between‐group difference in fasting blood sugar (FBS) was significant at the end of 10 weeks. Contrary to this finding, Saneei et al. (2013) did not find any significant changes in fasting blood sugar (FBS), after 6 weeks of intervention with the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, in children suffering from metabolic syndrome. It is conceivable that the contradiction between the present study and (Saneei et al., 2013) may be attributable to, first, the compliance of participants to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet being higher in the present study, and second, the duration of our trial was longer.",d753533b-ff1d-4a9c-afce-4424934916da
19,discussion7," Indeed, the length of intervention, that is, adherence to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, has been shown to modify its effects on the glucose‐insulin control system (Shirani et al., 2013). It is worth to mention that the results of similar trials conducted in adults with good dietary compliance during long‐term periods were in agreement with our result regarding fasting blood sugar (FBS) (Azadbakht et al., 2005).  The dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern can be considered as both a low glycemic index and low energy dense diet. Foods with low glycemic indices tend to lower postprandial glucose responses through the slow and sustained release of monosaccharides from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood circulation (Radulian et al., 2009). Foods with low energy densities tend to protect against weight‐associated insulin resistance through increased satiety and decreased subsequent food intake (Rolls et al., 2005).",7039c51c-7ae3-45da-bf4c-146fa899634f
20,discussion8," It is also possible that the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet results in improved insulin sensitivity, independent of weight changes, through its high content of beneficial micronutrients, such as magnesium and folate (Ard et al., 2004). Indeed, magnesium is crucial to insulin secretion by pancreatic β‐cells, interaction between insulin and its receptor, and post‐receptor insulin signaling which involves tyrosine kinase mediated phosphorylation (Simental‐Mendía et al., 2016). Folate is essential to prevent hyperhomocysteinemia, which causes insulin resistance by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and provoking inflammation in adipose tissue (Lind et al., 2019). Overall, the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet seems to be a good choice for the improvement of glycemic control.  3.",0f54e51d-b1ed-4072-8fc5-fde589dbc561
21,discussion9,"3 Lipid profile In our study, lipid profile, including TG, TC, low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐C, and high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐C, was significantly ameliorated in the intervention group, and remained statistically unchanged in the control group. As a result, analyses of between‐group differences revealed that the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet can reduce TG, TC, and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐C, and increase high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐C, in adolescents with hemophilia. Contrary to our findings, Saneei et al. (2013) reported that the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet did exert any significant effect on the lipid profile of children with metabolic syndrome. As we alluded to above, in Saneei et al, the trial was short‐term and suffered from relatively poor dietary compliance.  In general, our findings seem to be concordant with the findings of similar trials in adults.",e060890d-366e-4edb-9fd4-daf4e33db95b
22,discussion10," In a recent meta‐analysis of these trials, pooled results showed that the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet can decrease TG, TC, and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐C, and increase high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐C. Nevertheless, these pooled results reached statistical significance for TC and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐C but not for TG and high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐C. The pooled results of TG and high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐C appear to be respectively confounded by significant publication bias and significantly high between‐study heterogeneity (Siervo et al., 2015). Therefore, the pooled results of TG and high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐C may not be adequately reliable. It is important to note that significant decrements in TG, and significant increments in high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐C, were observed following intervention with the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet in well‐designed and well‐conducted trials (Azadbakht et al., 2005).",0d337bae-be89-4e18-be1a-286a5fac0830
23,discussion11,"  Although the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet is low in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, the beneficial effects of this diet on lipid profile are not only due to its low‐fat content (Miller et al., 2006). Indeed, vegetables and dairies, which are two indispensable constituents of the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, can also help to improve lipid profile. Intake of vegetables that are rich in dietary fiber has been reported to be inversely associated with dyslipidemia, characterized by high TC and high low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐C (Song et al., 2016). Dietary fiber can also increase the excretion of bile acids in feces, reduce the cholesterol pool in the liver, modify the activity of enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis, up‐regulate the expression of hepatic low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐C receptors, and increase plasma low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐C removal (Papathanasopoulos & Camilleri, 2010).",fe8b566f-828a-4ff4-b55f-b39caf137117
24,discussion12," Concomitantly, intake of dairy products that are rich in calcium has been reported to be inversely associated with dyslipidemia characterized by high TG and low high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐C (Song et al., 2016). Calcium can reduce fat absorption via the formation of insoluble calcium‐fatty soaps, affect the rate of lipolysis and lipogenesis via suppression of calciotropic hormones, modulate the activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, and increase thermogenesis (Heshmati et al., 2019).  3.4 Vitamin C In our study, vitamin C increased in the intervention group compared to the control group. Vitamin C is a water‐soluble antioxidant; therefore, the intake of fruits and vegetables in the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet can increase vitamin C and benefit hemophilia patients. Previous studies showed that prevention of oxidative stress is important for protein folding in patients with hemophilia (Malhotra et al., 2008).",aa629538-f129-4ec2-9251-6d6145a9dcc3
25,discussion13," Therefore, it is adherence to dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet may have long‐term favorable effects on chronic conditions in patients with hemodialysis.  3.5 Strengths and limitations The main strength of our study is that dietary compliance was assessed by a valid and reliable biomarker, that is, serum levels of vitamin C, allowing us to assert veracity in our findings. Previous studies showed that urinary sodium and potassium excretion, as measured in a 24‐hr urine sample, can be as a biomarker of compliance with the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet. Nevertheless, collecting of 24‐hr urine sample is difficult. Also, day to day variation of about 24‐hr urinary sodium is high, and several samplings are needed to eliminate day to day variation. (Taylor et al., 2010). Since it was not applicable for children, we used vitamin C because it does not have these limitations.",9f122ece-9182-4a43-a08e-7e92eb05dc98
26,discussion14, The main limitation of our study is that blinding was not applicable due to the nature of our intervention.  4 ,6de5aa61-d1bb-4f08-9a44-ec2aa54ad78c
27,conclusion0,"The dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet was primarily designed to control cardiovascular risk factors in healthy or unhealthy adults. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that this diet can also be beneficial in adolescents with hemophilia. Indeed, our findings suggest that the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet can improve blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipid profile. Therefore, it seems that this dietary approach can viably serve as an effective modifier of metabolic risk factors in adolescents suffering from hemophilia. However, further, well‐designed and well‐conducted, studies are needed to enable firm conclusions to be made.  5 TRANSPARENCY DECLARATION The lead author affirms that this manuscript is an honest, accurate, and transparent account of the study being reported.
