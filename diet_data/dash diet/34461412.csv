0,methods0," 2.1. Cohort  Between 2014 and 2018, a subset of 158 participants between 17 and 22 years old were recruited from the Children’s Health Study (Children’s Health Study (CHS)) [30] for the Meta-AIR study [31]. Subjects were selected if they had overweight or obesity in early adolescence, had not been diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, had no medical conditions, and were taking no medications that affect glucose metabolism [31]. Between January 2020 and March 2022, 140 of these participants were invited to participate in a follow-up visit. All but 7 participants underwent follow-up testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. All study visits were completed at the Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute at the University of Southern California. This study was approved by the University of Southern California Institutional Review Board.",7c714dcf-daf5-4840-b8b9-9ccf854dbcdc
1,methods1," Written informed consent was obtained from participants at both baseline and follow-up visits or by participants and their guardians for those under age 18 at baseline.  Of the 158 participants at baseline, 155 had diet data and data for at least one outcome. Eighty-six of these participated in the follow-up (Figure S1). An additional three Children’s Health Study (CHS) participants without baseline data completed the follow-up visit.  2.2. Glucose Outcomes  A 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) was performed at each visit, using a glucose load of 1.75 g of glucose per kg of body mass (max 75 g). Blood was sampled before the glucose challenge and at 30-, 60-, 90- and 120-min post-challenge. Glucose concentrations at each time point were measured in plasma.",7346fa46-e665-4228-b41a-f47825944f67
2,methods2," Fasting glucose was also measured using a glucometer before the glucose challenge, and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was not completed if participants had a fasting value greater than 126 mg/dL. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured in fasting whole blood samples. Glucose area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)) was calculated from the five glucose measurements using the trapezoidal method [32].  Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes were based on clinical cutoffs for HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, or 2-h plasma glucose [33]. Participants having either HbA1c values of 6.5% or higher, fasting glucose of 126 mg/dL or higher, or 2-h glucose of 200 mg/dL or higher were considered to have type 2 diabetes, while those with HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.4%, fasting glucose between 100 mg/dL and 125 mg/dL, or 2-h glucose between 140 mg/dL and 199 mg/dL were categorized as prediabetic.  2.3.",bcd64807-24bc-4a5c-9a1a-e64a60eadc98
3,methods3," Adiposity Outcomes  Weight and height were measured at each visit, and BMI calculated as kg per meter squared (kg/m2). Body composition was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DEXA)) whole body scans. Baseline scans were performed on either a Hologic QDR 4500W or Horizon W machine at baseline, while all follow-up scans were performed on the Horizon W. Body composition measures included total body fat percentage, fat mass to height ratio, fat free mass index (FFMI, kg/m2), android to gynoid ratio, trunk to leg ratio, trunk to limb ratio, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT, in3). Only body fat percentage and fat mass to height ratio were measured on the QDR 4500W machine.  2.4. Diet Assessment  At each visit, participants were asked to complete two 24-h dietary recalls on non-consecutive days: one weekday and one weekend day.",4a07b0cd-769e-472d-a4a7-c714831eed79
4,methods4," Baseline recalls were completed by trained interviewers using the Nutritional Data System for Research (Nutritional Data System for Research (NDSR)) software version 2014, developed by the Nutrition Coordinating Center (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA) [34], while follow-up recalls used the Automated Self-Administered 24-h (ASA24) Dietary Assessment Tool, version (2018), developed by the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA [35]. An average of the values from both days was calculated for each diet component. At baseline, 16 participants (10.3%) completed only one recall, and 9 (10.2%) completed only one recall at follow-up. If a participant did not complete both recalls, values from the single recall were used.",81517e9a-8698-411a-9bad-fde329966c39
5,methods5,"  Four diet indices were calculated from the recall data at both the baseline and follow-up visits: the 2015 Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)), and Diet Inflammatory Index (DII). The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) ranges from 0–100, is based on adherence to the United States Department of Agriculture (United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)) 2015 Dietary Guidelines [36] and contains the following thirteen elements standardized to calorie intake: total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, greens and beans, whole grains, refined grains, dairy, total protein foods, seafood and plant proteins, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, saturated fats, sodium, and added sugars. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scoring method follows the calculation proposed by Mellen et al.",88abbce6-66c5-424d-8594-c52eb94ba272
6,methods6," [37], using nutrient goals for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet adherence. This Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score ranges from 0 to 8 and includes the following elements standardized to calorie intake: protein, fiber, magnesium, calcium, potassium, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. One point was assigned if the nutrient goal was met, and half of a point was assigned if an intermediate nutrient goal was met. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was calculated using the method developed by Trichopoulou et al. [38], which ranges from 0 to 9 with ten components: vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, dairy, cereals, meat, poultry, fish, alcohol, and ratio of mono- to saturated fats. For each component, one point was assigned for exceeding the sex-specific median. The Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) was adapted from Shivappa et al.",2ffdb319-2831-43a3-8b59-2f2338195373
7,methods7," [39], with negative values indicating an anti-inflammatory diet and positive values indicating a pro-inflammatory diet. For each element, a centered percentile was calculated by comparing the reported intake to a global mean and standard deviation of intake. This centered percentile was multiplied by the element’s overall inflammatory effect score, and the scores for all elements were summed to produce the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) score. Twenty-eight of the forty-five elements from Shivappa et al. [39] were included: alcohol, beta-carotene, caffeine, carbohydrates, cholesterol, calories, total fat, fiber, iron, magnesium, folic acid, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, protein, saturated fat, selenium, zinc, and vitamins A, B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), C, D, and E. The remaining elements were excluded because they are not specifically captured by the recalls systems used in this study.",21ba92f6-2e9f-4651-ba17-8f98f3e1e73a
8,methods8," Trans fats were banned by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2015, with a 2018 deadline for implementation [40], and were excluded from the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) calculation in the follow-up visit.  2.5. Covariates  Questionnaires were administered to collect sociodemographic information, including age, sex, race and ethnicity, physical activity, and parental education. Ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, or Other. Parental education was categorized as “Did not complete high school”, “Completed high school”, “Completed more than high school”, or “Don’t know”. At baseline, physical activity was assessed as a binary variable, where participants responded yes or no to the question “Do you exercise?”.",c274b764-a836-49bf-93d0-3e3a7487d2d6
9,methods9," At follow-up, physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form [41], and metabolic equivalent of task (metabolic equivalent of task (MET)) minutes were calculated according to the scoring guidelines. Participants were considered to have “high” physical activity if they met either of the following criteria: (1) reported vigorous physical activity (vigorous physical activity (VPA)) three or more days per week and 1500 or more metabolic equivalent of task (MET) min per week or (2) seven days of any combination of vigorous physical activity (VPA), moderate physical activity (moderate physical activity (MPA)), and walking for at least 3000 metabolic equivalent of task (MET) min.",351daef2-92ab-41eb-ad91-0e2327a34475
10,methods10," Participants were considered to have “moderate” physical activity if they (1) reported at least 3 days of vigorous physical activity (VPA) where the activity lasted at least 30 min or (2) five or more days of moderate physical activity (MPA) or walking where the activity lasted at least 30 min or (3) five or more days of some combination of vigorous physical activity (VPA), moderate physical activity (MPA), and walking for at least 600 metabolic equivalent of task (MET) min. Participants were categorized as having “low” physical activity if they did not meet any of these criteria.  2.6. Statistical Analysis  Descriptive statistics were calculated for all outcomes and exposures. Pearson’s correlations were calculated between the four diet scores at each visit separately and between time points. Independent two-sample t-tests, chi-square tests, or Fisher’s exact tests were used to test for differences in participant demographics between the baseline cohort and follow-up cohort.",b2936948-d5a8-41db-a077-59333c214089
11,methods11," Paired t-tests or McNemar–Bowker tests were used to test for differences in exposures and outcomes between visits. Due to the small numbers of participants with values meeting the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes, prediabetes and diabetes were combined into one category (prediabetes/T2D) for analysis. Primary outcomes of interest were those related to glucose regulation: prediabetes/T2D, fasting glucose, 2-h glucose, glucose area under the curve (AUC), and HbA1c. Body composition measurements were secondary outcomes: BMI, body fat percent, FFMI, fat mass to height ratio, android to gynoid ratio, trunk to leg ratio, trunk to limb ratio, and VAT.  Cross-sectional analyses were performed for both baseline and follow-up visits, using multivariable linear regression for continuous outcomes and logistic regression for prediabetes/T2D.",aa371023-7f97-464b-b55c-1559f87b42c6
12,methods12," For longitudinal analyses, change in diet indices from baseline to follow-up was modeled against change in outcome using linear regression for continuous outcomes, or against diabetes at follow-up using logistic regression. Longitudinal models also adjusted for baseline diet score. Beta coefficients for exposures were scaled to one standard deviation (SD) of the exposure to account for the differing scales.  All analyses included the following covariates: age, ethnicity, physical activity, energy intake, and parental education. Because these factors were not accounted for in the scoring system, analyses with Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) scores additionally controlled for sex, and analyses with Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) additionally controlled for energy intake.",777128ae-4784-4004-ac02-812406279628
13,methods13," BMI and body fat percent were presumed to be on the causal pathway between diet and prediabetes and T2D and were not included as covariates in the main analyses to avoid overadjustment [42].  2.7. Sensitivity Analyses  For all diet indices and glucose outcomes, two additional analyses were performed. The first did not include physical activity in as a covariate to determine if it had the potential to confound the relationship between diet and glucose regulation and if it was necessary to control for this variable in the main analysis. The second analysis controlled for body fat percent. Though we expect that body fat (or BMI) is on the causal pathway between diet and T2D, we included it as a covariate to examine the possibility that body fat mediates the relationship between diet and T2D.",c1804bad-602a-4eed-90c3-fd655db95b4b
14,methods14,"  We also performed additional logistic regression analyses to examine the association between each adiposity measure and risk for prediabetes/T2D at each visit and to examine the associations between changes in these measures between visits and risk for prediabetes/T2D at the follow-up visit. Models were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, parental education, energy intake, and physical activity as in the main analyses.  3. Results  Average length of follow-up was 4.1 years (SD = 1.1 years). There were no differences in participant demographics at each visit (Table 1). Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) scores significantly decreased from baseline to follow-up (Table 2), and mean fasting glucose and glucose area under the curve (AUC) increased (Table 3). Mean BMI and body fat percentage also increased between visits (Table 4).  3.1.",6795485b-c9f7-4f4a-bc81-ab13b7818f08
15,methods15," Prediabetes/T2D  Positive change in Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores between the baseline and follow-up visits was associated with decreased risk for prediabetes/T2D at follow-up (Figure 1). A one-point increase in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score over the follow-up period was associated with a 64% (OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.68) reduction in risk for prediabetes/T2D at follow-up, while a one-point increase in Healthy Eating Index (HEI) between visits was associated with a 9% decrease in risk (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.96). When scaled by standard deviation of diet index, improvements in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score reduced the risk for prediabetes/T2D by a greater extent than the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) (OR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.46; OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72, 0.93, respectively).",4fe2081a-74ee-4c17-9b4b-1fa9bcee93d0
16,methods16," In the cross-sectional analysis of the follow-up visit, higher Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were also associated with reduced risk for prediabetes/T2D. At baseline, only Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was associated with reduced risk for prediabetes/T2D.  3.2. Fasting Glucose and Glucose Tolerance  There were no statistically significant cross-sectional associations between fasting glucose and any dietary index at either visit or between change in diet scores and change in fasting glucose between visits (Figure 2).  Higher Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores and higher Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were associated with lower 2-h glucose values at baseline in the cross-sectional analyses (Healthy Eating Index (HEI): β = −7.01, 95% CI: −12.86, −1.16; Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS): β = −7.43, 95% CI: −13.25, −1.61) (Figure 2).",9b053405-6bb3-4537-be07-ef5c6f3e53ff
17,methods17," Follow-up Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were inversely associated with 2-h glucose at the same visit (Healthy Eating Index (HEI): β = −8.64, 95% CI: −16.16, −1.12; Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH): β = −8.25, 95% CI: −15.71, −0.78) and with glucose area under the curve (AUC) (Healthy Eating Index (HEI): β = −11.34, 95% CI: −20.84, −1.84; Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH): β = −10.99, 95% CI: −20.44, −1.53).  3.3. Hemoglobin A1c  There were no statistically significant associations between HbA1c and any dietary index. However, there were consistent inverse relationships between higher Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and HbA1c at both visits and between change in Healthy Eating Index (HEI) or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and change in HbA1c between visits although these did not reach the threshold for statistical significance (Figure 2).",e8bed987-9004-469d-8b88-4b4c5bbfc6bf
18,methods18,"  3.4. Body Composition  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was consistently associated with several adiposity measures (Table 5). At the follow-up visit, higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were associated with lower BMI (β = −1.64, 95% CI: −3.17, −0.11), body fat percent (β = −1.79, 95% CI: −3.01, −0.57), and fat mass to height ratio (β = −1.09, 95% CI: −3.27, −0.61) at the same visit, and increases in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) between visits were also inversely associated with change in BMI (β = −1.64, 95% CI: −2.92, −0.36) and body fat percent (β = −1.62, 95% CI: −2.02, −0.17). Similar inverse associations were observed between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and measures of central adiposity, including trunk to limb ratio and VAT.  The Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) was positively associated with body fat percent in the cross-sectional baseline analyses (Table 5).",e172e7f4-18f6-445f-b025-49c0bdcf44a5
19,methods19," Though not statistically significant, the Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) was also positively associated with most adiposity measurements at both visits, and positive change in Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) was associated with positive changes in adiposity from baseline to follow-up.  3.5. Sensitivity Analyses  Results from the sensitivity analyses are reported in Supplemental Tables S1–S3. Models that did not adjust for physical activity had slightly larger effect estimates for the relationship between Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and impaired glucose tolerance compared to models that did adjust for physical activity. There was little effect on risk for prediabetes/T2D, and the main findings were the same in the physical activity-adjusted and -unadjusted models.",fd30c611-ada7-495e-b4f9-8a92e96d0232
20,methods20," Adjustment for body fat percent also had little effect on the relationships between Healthy Eating Index (HEI) or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and prediabetes/T2D, suggesting that it may not mediate the relationship between diet and prediabetes/T2D. However, in most cases, controlling for body fat percent attenuated the effects of each diet on all other glucose outcomes.  BMI, body fat percent, FFMI, fat mass to height ratio, and VAT were significantly associated with increased risk for prediabetes/T2D at all time points (Table S4). At the follow-up visit only, android to gynoid ratio, trunk to leg ratio, and trunk to limb ratio were also positively associated with prediabetes/T2D.  4. Discussion  We observed strong inverse associations both in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses between the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and risk of prediabetes/T2D.",bb68e9e7-e0ef-48f5-93dd-676744fb84bd
21,methods21," We also found negative associations between the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and 2-h glucose, HbA1c, fasting glucose, and glucose area under the curve (AUC) at both visits and in the longitudinal analysis though these relationships were not all statistically significant. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was not consistently associated with prediabetes/T2D, glucose measurements, or body composition. We also observed inverse relationships between Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with measures of adiposity and body composition, suggesting that high diet quality may be protective against obesity and adverse accumulation of adipose tissue. The period between late adolescence to early adulthood is one of transition, where young people begin to live independently and gain more control of their lifestyles.",32dafea6-dd3c-4b45-b4b7-cf6324b60c2a
22,methods22," However, there are limited assessments of change in diet quality during this transition [43], and these results emphasize the importance of considering diet quality in T2D risk within this age group.  To our knowledge, no other study has evaluated the longitudinal relationship between glucose dysregulation and Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), and Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) in young adults. Several meta-analyses have summarized the relationship between diet quality and type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, or other measures of glucose dysregulation in older adults. These analyses consistently report strong protective effects of healthy dietary patterns, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) [10,13,15].",0c78ce4b-0f83-4385-93ca-47da12265696
23,methods23," However, previous reviews found effects of similar magnitude between the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) [14], whereas we report a larger protective effect associated with increases in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet adherence across both visits compared to either the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) or Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). The Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) has been inconsistently associated with risk of T2D in older adults [17,18] though inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes [44]. Like Vahid (2017), we observed positive associations between Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) and impaired glucose intolerance and prediabetes.  Diet is also a risk factor for obesity, which is itself a significant driver of the T2D epidemic in both adults and youth [6,45,46], and increases in body fat greatly increase the risk for future diabetes [47].",6ccd5805-58c2-4892-91a3-844f5b991038
24,methods24," Accumulation of visceral fat is also linked to T2D development and severity [48,49]. Our study found similar effects, with multiple adiposity indices significantly associated with increased risk of prediabetes/T2D. Our findings also suggest an inverse relationship between high diet quality and central obesity, with Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) consistently associated with android to gynoid fat ratio, trunk to limb fat ratios, and VAT. There also appeared to be positive associations between Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) and adiposity and visceral fat measures. These findings suggest that high quality diets may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in part by reducing total body and visceral fat.  This study has several strengths. Participants were recruited from the Southern California Children’s Health Study [30], which allowed detailed measures of glucose metabolism, diet, body composition, and lifestyle factors.",a703a469-a9cd-479c-aac3-319221a812bc
25,methods25," oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DEXA) provide highly detailed information about glucose metabolism and body composition, respectively, beyond that of fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, or BMI alone [50,51]. 2-h glucose and glucose area under the curve (AUC), for example, assess glucose tolerance, and impaired glucose tolerance is an early sign of glucose dysregulation and type 2 diabetes risk not often captured in clinical settings [52]. Additionally, exposures and outcomes were assessed at both visits, which allowed us to examine associations across time. Despite this, we note some limitations. Two systems were used to collect 24-h dietary recalls: the Nutritional Data System for Research (NDSR) at baseline and the ASA24 at follow-up. We are not aware of any evidence that this difference would introduce bias away from the null, and any misclassification of diet is expected to be nondifferential and independent of prediabetes/T2D status.",ee436d3c-4369-4540-8954-dbb9d725d92e
26,methods26," It is also common for studies involving multiple cohorts to integrate different diet assessment measures [53,54]. There is a possibility that residual confounding contributed to our reported effects; family history of T2D, maternal obesity, and low birthweight are also associated with young-onset T2D though they are less likely to be associated with diet. However, the magnitude of the relationships we report are large, and any confounding by these or other factors are unlikely to account for the entire effect. Additionally, our sample size for the longitudinal analysis was 85, limiting the statistical power to detect significant relationships. Limitations of one of the dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DEXA) machines used at baseline also limited the available sample size for some adiposity measurements (e.g., android to gynoid fat ratio, trunk to limb fat ratio).",abe8e28c-3105-44cd-80a3-436b3a7a9b1b
27,methods27," However, power was sufficient to identify strong, statistically significant, protective effects of high-quality diets on prediabetes risk.  The COVID-19 pandemic may also have affected our recruitment efforts for the follow-up visit. Our recruitment began as the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) was declared first a Public Health Emergency and then a pandemic [55]. The resulting disruptions to daily life would have affected our participants and likely impacted lifestyle factors such as physical activity, sleep, and eating habits as well as stress, social supports, and physical health, all of which may affect non-communicable disease risk [55,56,57]. It is possible that the observed decreases in diet quality between the baseline and follow-up visits may be, in part, due to the pandemic. Even if some of the change in diet were due to changes in lifestyle associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, our findings emphasize the importance of maintaining a healthy diet to reduce the risk for T2D.",8c2b5ee1-42fe-48a1-8490-0e583d07742a
28,methods28,"  Our results indicate that improvements in adherence to the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary patterns may reduce risk for T2D. Though both measure diet quality, the construction of each index emphasizes different nutrients and food groups, and there are several ways in which an individual may improve their score and overall diet quality. For example, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) rewards greater adherence to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Dietary Guidelines for Americans with higher scores on a 100-point scale [36]. To improve a Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score, one has several options: (1) increase intake of one or several food groups (fruit, vegetables, seafood, etc.",86beb34c-a3af-4123-a77c-ad3e6e80f6b8
29,methods29,") to the levels recommend by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); (2) reduce intake of added sugars and salt as recommended by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); or (3) reduce the proportion of total grains that come from refined sources or increase the proportion of dietary fats that are mono- or polyunsaturated [58]. Similarly, improvements in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score could be achieved by reducing consumption of saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium, or by increasing fiber, magnesium, potassium, and calcium intake [37]. By encouraging changes to overall dietary patterns rather than emphasizing specific foods or nutrients (i.e., kilocalories, sugar-sweetened beverages), individuals may have more flexibility in their choice of dietary habits to alter or methods of alteration, leading to more successful behavior change [59,60].  5.",fcd1620e-d8c2-44a2-8371-0887fb59b70d
30,methods30," Conclusions  Late adolescence to early adulthood is a period of significant change and represents an important window in which to establish lifelong habits [29]. To our knowledge, this study is one of few to evaluate the impact of dietary changes on glucose regulation in people between the ages of 18 and 30. We found that adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Dietary Guidelines is associated with reduced risk for prediabetes and better glucose tolerance. Improvement in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores over the follow-up period was also associated with lower risk for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, with the strongest effects observed for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.",7d1b80ae-6d71-494a-832a-bfe762b46d09

Figure 1 Coefficient plots for the effects of diet quality on prediabetes. “Baseline” and “follow-up” values are the result of cross-sectional analyses of diet quality score and risk of prediabetes/T2D at the same visit. The value for “change between visits” represents the risk of prediabetes/T2D at the follow-up visit associated with change in diet score between the baseline and the follow-up visit. Effects are standardized to one standard deviation of exposure. Covariates: Baseline and follow-up models. Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, physical activity, and parental education.",cb1ad2b3-d8c0-4f6a-9f4e-54cad4076a33
