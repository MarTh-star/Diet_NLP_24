0,background0,"Breast cancer, the most prevalent cancer in women, is a major public health problem worldwide [1]. Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among female both in developed and developing countries [2]. In Iran, breast cancer ranks first among diagnosed malignancies in women, comprising 24.4% of all cancers with the age-standardized incidence rates of 23.1 per 100,000, and is the fifth most common causes of death due to cancers [3].  Among environmental risk factors of breast cancer, diet has been considered as an important modifiable exposure [4]. However, epidemiological studies have reported conflicting results regarding the association between food intake and breast cancer risk [5, 6]. On the other hand, most of these studies have traditionally focused on the effects of individual foods and nutrients on cancer risk [6–8].",be150cfe-5f88-4777-a360-82049d9956c0
1,background1," Although, some potential biological mechanisms that underlie observed associations can be identified, “single nutrient” approach may not detect small effects of single dietary components and can be limited by the multicollinearity of dietary intake variables [5, 7, 8]. Therefore, studying entire dietary patterns is a promising alternative approach to overcome limitations of the single food or nutrient approach, account for the combined effects of and synergy between single dietary components [5, 7, 8] and provides useful information for suggesting guidelines and public health recommendations [7]. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) which emphasizes fruits and vegetables, plant proteins, moderate amounts of low-fat dairy products, and low amounts of sweets and sodium, is a healthy eating pattern recommended for the general public by the United States Department of Agriculture [7, 9, 10].",9fb0ddf7-dba5-4567-ac02-4722ba778bd8
2,background2," Though this dietary approach was at first suggested to reduce hypertension and cardiovascular disease risk, several previous studies reported the inverse association between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score and colorectal cancer [7, 11, 12]. It seems that Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet might be effective for cancer prevention, especially because some of its characteristics, like high fruit and vegetable consumption and low meat intake, have been implicated in the etiology of cancer [7, 10]. While several prospective [13–17] and case-control [18–22] studies have considered exploratory dietary patterns and breast cancer risk, few studies have examined the associations between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and breast cancer [5, 10, 23].",7897d574-6640-461a-a193-cc6265c2b151
3,background3," A prospective cohort study showed that a high Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score reduced the risk of estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer [10] and another case-control study indicated an inverse association between adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan and odds of breast cancer in Iranian women [23]. On the other hand, the association between habitual intake of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern and breast cancer has not been adequately investigated in the Middle East, where the dietary intakes are greatly different from those in Western countries. Moreover, these limited studies have equivalently adopted the operationalized approach proposed by Fung et al. to calculate the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index [12].",9c0b8f06-13e6-43b0-8049-b8393222b61d

Eligible cases were all incident cases of breast cancer in past 6 months who did not undergo any cancer treatments at the time of interview. Exclusion criteria for cases were history of hormone replacement therapy, being pregnant or lactating and having special dietary habits such as vegetarian.

Information on the subject’s activity level was gathered using a valid physical activity questionnaire [27] and was then quantified in form of metabolic equivalent hour/day (METs-h/d). This method has been described in detail elsewhere [27, 28]. Weight was measured using digital scale (Seca, Germany) while the subjects were minimally clothed without shoes and recorded to the nearest 100 g. Height was measured via a wall mounted stadiometer (Seca, Germany) with 2 mm precision, while the participants wearing no shoes. The ratio of weight (in kg) to square of height (in meter) was used to determine the individual’s body mass index (body mass index (BMI)).",85b7dcf8-1aa8-43d7-aac5-47be5fb9fec5
8,methods3,"  Dietary assessment We used a validated 168 item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) with multiple choice frequency response options for assessing usual dietary intakes of all participants. Reproducibility and relative validity of this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in evaluating major dietary patterns and food and nutrient intake among Iranian adults have already been demonstrated [29]. Subjects were asked to provide the frequency of consumption of certain portions of each food on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis throughout the preceding year before cancer diagnosis (for cases) or hospital admission (for controls). By using household measures, the portion sizes for each food item were converted to grams. Specified portion size, dish composition, and the average of reported frequency (e.g., divided by 30 if once a month) was taken into consideration to calculate daily value for each food item.",8cc07e55-772b-4c20-a05e-304c49c48dfa
9,methods4," To calculate the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) nutrient intakes, the modified Nutritionist IV software was used. The modification was done to include the Iranian foods in the original USDA food composition table embedded in the software.  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score Computation of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores has previously been described in detail [7]. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index scores were generated based on the separate indexes defined by Mellen, Fung, Dixon, and Günther [11, 24–26]. Table 1 shows scoring standards and points for use in all these indexes. Dixonʾs Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet index includes 8 food groups and one nutrient (total fruits, total vegetables, whole grains, total dairy products, nuts/seeds/legumes, meat/meat equivalent, added sugar, saturated fat and alcohol). One point is assigned to each one.",675c1fd1-4278-4793-b54a-046d405422f3

Greater adherence to the Mellen’s Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet index was associated with higher intakes of potassium, protein, fiber, magnesium, and calcium, and lower intakes of cholesterol, sodium, total fat, and saturated fat. The daily nutrient goal was set to a 2100 kcal/d diet, regardless of subject’s gender.

The scoring system is based on quintile categories of eating the mentioned food items. For recommended components, those in the lowest quintile of intake receive 1 point and those in the highest quintile receive 5 points. In contrast, for components for which lower intakes are favorable, those in the highest and the lowest quintile of intake receives1 and 5 points, respectively.

16,methods11,"  A more complex food-based Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet index has been defined by Günter et al. [25]. This index relies on 10 components to evaluate the individual’s compliance to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet plan. In accordance to their scales, these components are divided as follows: Six components on a 10-point scale, which include: (i) fruits and fruit juice, (ii) vegetables and potato, (iii) meat, poultry, fish and eggs, (iv) nuts, seeds and legumes, (v) fats and oils, and (vi) sweets.  Four components with a 5-point scale, including: (i) total dairy, (ii) low-fat dairy, (iii) whole grains, and (iv) high-fiber grains.    Recommendations for 4 various energy intakes including 1600, 2000, 2300, and 3100 kcal/d are the basis of target intakes for each component that accounts for activity level, sex, and age defined by Dietary Reference Intakes (25).",ed76d871-5ddf-41b0-a07d-1faeaa6ffb05

27,discussion0,"To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first observational study that epidemiologically examined the association between 4 Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet indexes and breast cancer risk. In present case-control study, we found that a greater adherence to 2 of the 4 Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) indexes (Mellen’s and Günther’s indexes) was associated with markedly decreased risk of breast cancer in Iranian women. After stratified by menopausal status, only Mellen’s Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index was linked to reduced risk of breast cancer, among postmenopausal women. The available evidence linking the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet to breast cancer is limited. Fung et al. reported that the whole Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) was significantly associated with a lower risk of ER-breast cancer in postmenopausal women [10]. Recently, Soltani et al.",4cc06eb1-e8f6-4dc5-a4a6-6aded05776bb
28,discussion1," also revealed that in Iranian women the highest quartile of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score had 85% lower odds of breast cancer than women in the bottom quartile. Stratified analysis showed such association in postmenopausal women, but not in premenopausal women [23].  The results of current study suggest that the main effective components of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which can protect against breast cancer, may exist in almost all indexes. On the other hand, the lack of an association between Dixon’s and Fung’s Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and breast cancer in our research demonstrates that differing in composition of the indexes (some indexes emphasize on food choices; however, the other may be nutrient-based or calorie-based) and the scoring procedures may affect the results.",f6a4d0fd-7798-49e4-bd65-649dd3499f5f
29,discussion2," Dixon and Günther indexes use certain cutoffs and Fung index applies rankings of intakes whereas Mellen’s index includes a density-based method (ie, intakes are evaluated relative to total calorie). Furthermore, Dixonʾs and Mellen’s indexes directly assess the saturated fat intake while both indexes developed by Fung and Günther estimate the intake of saturated fat indirectly through consumption of saturated fat rich foods [11, 24–26]. Finally, it is important to understand the inherent difference of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index formulation. In Dixon’s method, meat and meat equivalent consumption have been considered. However, Fung’s index notices intake of red and processed meat, and in Günther’s index intake of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs is important [11, 24, 25].  In a cohort study by Miller et al.",65b63f4d-7c10-41fc-af62-026e819fb9e8
30,discussion3,", men with the highest scores on all 4 of the indexes and women with the highest scores on Mellen’s, Fung’s, and Günther’s indexes had significant reduced risk of colorectal cancer [7]. The Fung’s index consists of 8 components including 7 food groups and one nutrient (sodium) [10]. This index has been used frequently in studies which investigated the association between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern and diseases [10, 30]. Unlike our results, Hirko et al. reported that a significant reduced risk of human epidermal growth factor 2 positive breast cancer was observed among women in 5th vs. 1st quintile of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores based on Fung’s index [30]. However, Fung’s score had no significant association with other molecular subtypes of breast cancer in this study [30].",034fe594-c719-4108-ad46-451727f5c5a5
31,discussion4," Similar significant inverse association between a high Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score based on Fung’s index and ER-breast cancer but not of ER+ breast cancer, was reported in a study by Fung et al. [10].  In previous studies on dietary patterns and breast cancer risk in Iranian women, a ‘healthy’ dietary pattern characterized by the consumption of vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy products, legumes, olive and vegetable oils, fish, condiments, organ meat, poultry, soya and whole grains was inversely related to breast cancer risk [21]. Moreover, the results of another study by Heidari et al. showed significant increase in breast cancer risk in women in the highest category of the unhealthy dietary pattern (OR: 2.21; 95%CI: 1.04, 4.690; P-trend = 0.009) [30].",814b757a-30f7-40ae-be96-d8c7ff18915f
32,discussion5," The mentioned study also showed that after stratifying by menopausal status, the association between breast cancer risk and unhealthy dietary pattern was statistically significant only among post-menopausal women (OR: 3.56; 95%CI: 1.16, 10.95; P-trend = 0.008) [28]. In our study, component analysis revealed that in overall, greater intake of fruits, total vegetables, vegetables without potatoes, grains, total dairy product, low fat dairy products and potassium was significantly associated with reduced risk of breast cancer. Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and fiber which have been shown to play a protective role against breast cancer [10, 31].  Comparing 4 Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet indexes in the same study for the same outcome is the main strength of our study. In addition, only recently diagnosed women with breast cancer (within the past 6 months) were enrolled in this study.",0052900b-5528-435e-bd57-15fc723c2b56
33,discussion6," Therefore, alteration in the diet by cases due to cancer diagnosis is less possible. The high participation rate of the study subjects and adjusting the analysis for confounding variables were the other strength of the study. Where economic resources are severely limited, food consumption is strongly correlated to income so that even little income differences are directly reflected in diet. Thus, studies in developing countries can offer unique opportunities to investigate the association between diet and cancer (due to large between person variation) [32]. Moreover, dietary patterns are likely to vary according to geographic region, socio-economic status, cultural practices, and food preferences and availability [28]. Especially, dietary intake of the Middle-Eastern population has its own unique characteristics, being recognized by higher consumption of refined grains (white rice and bread) and hydrogenated fats and a higher percentage of energy from carbohydrates [28].",8d6504d7-af88-4b6b-b658-05853b6420b7
34,discussion7,"  On the other hand, our study has some limitations. First, recall bias is possible due to the hospital-based case-control design of study. In case-control studies, cases may recall their previous diet differently in the context of their cancer diagnosis and this can affect the associations (overestimation). Second, the possibility of selection bias cannot be avoided in retrospective case-control studies. In the present study, the probability of selection bias was minimized by high participation rates and by selecting hospital controls from patients whose admission diagnosis was unrelated to alcohol intake, tobacco smoking, and diet-related diseases (limiting share exposure). Lack of precision of results due to small sample size is another limitation of our study. Moreover, although we used a validated food-frequency questionnaire for assessing the dietary intake, measurement errors that might led to underestimation or even over estimation of associations were inevitable [29].",78be4b54-b653-40bd-9cd1-2f44f6df5c5d
35,discussion8," Finally, breast cancer is a hormone-sensitive cancer and evidence indicates that dietary pattern may have an impact on some subtypes of breast cancer and no effect on others. For example, two prospective cohort studies showed that Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were inversely associated with ER- breast cancer [5, 10]. Therefore, it was better to stratify the results by hormone receptor status. However, we didn’t collect the information about the cancer subtype of our patients. Additional well-designed studies without these limitations are needed to elucidate the role of various aspects of 4 Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet indexes in prediction of breast cancer risk and find a standardized Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet index in these patients.  Conclusion Overall, we demonstrated that 2 of 4 Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet indexes (Mellen’s and Günther’s) reduced breast cancer risk in women.",685a2488-6393-404f-8b42-c71be80f41bf
