0,methods0,"Participants We used data from participants of the Medical Research Council (Medical Research Council (MRC)) National Survey of Health and Development (National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD)). The original National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) sample consisted of 5362 babies born in 1 week in March 1946 to married parents in England, Scotland or Wales, stratified by social class(  19  ). This sample has been followed up twenty-four times since birth(  20  ,  21  ). At the 23rd follow-up, eligible study members (n 2856) were invited to complete a clinical assessment at one of six clinical research facilities or home visitation by a nurse when they were 60–64 years. Invitations were not sent to those who had died (n 778), who were living abroad (n 570), had previously withdrawn from the study (n 594), or had been lost to follow-up (n 564). A total of 2229 participants responded of whom 76 % (n 1690) attended a clinic and 24 % (n 539) had a home visit.",5cd72257-4f29-4f44-ac39-a1355ab11e0e
1,methods1," Although this sample was broadly representative of the national population at a similar age, individuals attending the clinical assessment had lower adiposity and lifetime smoking exposure and higher levels of physical activity compared with the original cohort(  22  ). Information about participants’ smoking habits at 69 years was used to impute missing values at 60–64 years as described below. For the main analyses in this study we included participants who had information for at least one of the vascular measures at 60–64 years (1565 for cIMT and 1257 for pulse wave velocity (PWV)) and who had dietary information from at least two adult time points (1335 for cIMT and 1081 for pulse wave velocity (PWV)). A flow chart of participants included in our study can be found in the online Supplementary Fig. S1. Ethical approval was obtained from the Greater Manchester and the Scotland Research Ethics Committees and participants provided written and informed consent (Fig. 1).Fig.",40ab47a2-2ec6-4bc0-8322-7ac5c9b97df6
2,methods2," 1 Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-type diet score per year by sex of the 769 participants with dietary data from all time points.     Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-type diet Information about dietary intake was collected using 5-d estimated diet diaries when participants were aged 36, 43, 53 and 60–64 years(  23  –  27  ). All food and drink consumed were coded in Medical Research Council (MRC) Human Nutrition Research Cambridge using the in-house programmes, Diet In Data Out and Diet In Nutrients Out. Nutrient intakes were calculated based on McCance and Widdowson’s The Composition of Foods(28). A total of 2411, 2256, 1772 and 1869 participants at 36, 43, 53 and 60–64 years, respectively, completed ≥3 d of the diet diaries.",68eb9ce4-6f26-4b39-b041-fc747c059649
3,methods3," When generating the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet in National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), we included all participants with dietary information regardless of whether they attended the clinical assessment at 60–64 years.  We calculated the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score in accordance with previously published methods by Fung et al.(  5  ). The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was based on the original studies of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet focusing on eight components in particular: high intake of fruits (including pure fruit juice), vegetables (excluding potatoes), nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy products, wholegrains and low intake of red and processed meats, Na and sweetened beverages (including sugar sweetened cordial and sweetened fruit based drinks)(  5  ). These components consisted of discrete foods as well as disaggregated foods(  29  ).",ea6971cc-b832-46c6-aecc-f3f897b4c98e
4,methods4," Details of what was included in each of these components can be found in the online Supplementary Table S1. Each individual’s Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was calculated for each year using the following steps: (1) the energy density for each component was calculated, for example fruit (g)/energy (4184 kJ (1000 kcal))(  30  ); (2) each component was classified into quintiles (Q), where fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy products and wholegrains were assigned 1–5 points in order of most consumption. Quintiles for red and processed meats, free sugar and Na were assigned 1–5 points in order of least consumption; (3) the quintiles for each component were summed to obtain an overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score which could range from 8 to 40; (4).",88abd2d0-f8a9-4914-8a06-4f242ba9368d
5,methods5," As the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was higher in women (mean difference=2·3; 95 % CI 1·9, 2·8), the overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was grouped into sex-specific quintiles (Q1–Q5) for use in regression models.  We calculated a cumulative average of all Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores over the 24–28-year period for each individual who had dietary information from at least two time points (n 2477). This represents long-term adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet(  31  ). This mean, long-term Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was also grouped into sex-specific quintiles (Q1–Q5).  Cardiovascular risk factors systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were measured twice using a HEM-705 sphygmomanometer (Omron) at the 60–64 years clinic visits. The second reading (or first if missing) was used for analysis.",4fa288e5-9f09-4856-8bc1-23c41d003635
6,methods6," Total cholesterol, HDL, TAG and LDL were also measured in fasting blood samples as previously described(  20  ,  32  ). Information on the use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs was self-reported at 60–64 years.  Vascular measures at 60–64 years Vascular measures were obtained by trained research staff during the clinical assessment only when participants were 60–64 years. pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured using the Vicorder (Skidmore Medical) by placing a 10-cm wide pressure cuff at the upper right thigh and 3 cm partial cuff over the right carotid artery. Cuffs were inflated to 65 mmHg for 10–15 s. Path length was measured between the cuffs and defined as the distance between the suprasternal notch directly to the top of the femoral cuff. pulse wave velocity (PWV) was automatically calculated by an integral algorithm.",b6a3e015-bef3-4011-9578-15f1cf892098
7,methods7," cIMT was measured in the left and right common carotid artery using a high-resolution imaging scanner (Vivid I, GE Healthcare (12 MHz probe)) with a 12 MHz probe(  33  ,  34  ). Participants with carotid plaque, cIMT >1·5 mm with abnormal shape and wall texture, were excluded (n 13)(  34  ). A combined average of left and right cIMT is used as one outcome. To increase comparability, each outcome was standardised to a mean of 0 and sd of 1.  Covariates Socioeconomic position (Socioeconomic position (SEP)) at age 53 years (or 43 years if missing) was grouped into: professional and intermediate; skilled non-manual; semi-skilled and unskilled manual.  BMI was calculated using the standard formula with information from height and weight measured at 60–64 years. Physical activity in adulthood was self-reported.",e019f2b2-e851-4aeb-a2a8-e0f3887fb01d
8,methods8," Participants were categorised as inactive (reported no participation); moderately active (participated in relevant activity one to four times/month) or most active (participated in relevant activities five or more times/month) using information at 36, 43, 53 and 60–64 years. The overall physical activity score was the sum of responses at each time point, ranging from 0 to 8(  35  ). Smoking status at 60–64 years was categorised as never, current or ex-smoker at 60–64 years (or 53 or 69 years if missing (n 115)). ",c553486c-96a9-4777-b221-a23381544533
9,analysis0,"First, a series of regression models determined if long-term adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet (modelled as sex-specific quintiles) associated with: antihypertensive medication, lipid-lowering medication, diastolic BP (DBP), systolic BP (SBP), total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and TAG at 60–64 years. We used logistic regression models when antihypertensive or lipid-lowering medications were the outcomes and linear regression when HDL was the outcome. We used censored normal regression when systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), TAG, total cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol were the outcomes. Individuals taking antihypertensive or lipid-lowering medication were censored at their observed value. This assumes that the underlying BP or lipid levels in an individual taking medication is at least as high as their observed value and aims to reduce bias and a loss of statistical power(  36  ).",2c39e6de-96b7-408b-b37c-360d720028ca
10,analysis1," TAG were not normally distributed so log transformed values were used in the model. All models were adjusted for Socioeconomic position (SEP), BMI, smoking and physical activity. Log likelihood ratio tests assessed deviation from linearity by comparing models with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) quintiles fitted as a categorical variable to models with Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) quintiles fitted as a continuous variable.  Second, regression models assessed associations between long-term adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet and the standardised vascular function outcomes: cIMT and pulse wave velocity (PWV). Models were adjusted for Socioeconomic position (SEP), BMI, smoking and physical activity. Deviation from linearity was tested using log likelihood ratio tests. Interactions between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet and sex on the vascular outcomes were also assessed.",b78c1c49-6b26-41ff-8f5e-21dddf9b4445
11,analysis2," Models were re-run separately for individual Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores at 36, 43, 53 and 60–64 years, adjusting for the covariates mentioned above. In order to maximise power, these analyses did not exclude participants with dietary information available from only one time point.  Third, models that assessed long-term adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet and vascular function were additionally adjusted for CV-risk factors found to be associated with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet in step one. This step assessed the potential for a mediating role of CV-risk factors on the relationship between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet and vascular function.

These participants were more physically active, smoked less and had a lower BMI compared with people attending the clinical assessment who did not have this dietary and vascular measure information (n 820).  Mean cIMT and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were slightly higher for men compared with women, whereas Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were higher for women (Table 1).

This difference in effect size is likely due to the differences in length of exposure, specification of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and study design.

Although a single measure of cIMT has been shown to predict CVD, it has been shown to have no predictive value beyond conventional CV-risk factors(  13  ,  40  ). We observed that the relationship between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet and both measures of vascular function was not explained by conventional CV-risk factors (systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), lipid-lowering medication, HDL-cholesterol and TAG) and therefore associations are not likely to be acting through these mechanisms.",56214a15-009a-403a-9cb4-f3eede4822b1

The longitudinal design of National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) allowed us to carry out secondary analysis to examine the potential for sensitive periods in adulthood in which the consumption of a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet might be most beneficial for vascular function. The association between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and pulse wave velocity (PWV) did not differ greatly over time. However, the association between greater adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet at 36 and 43 years and cIMT was stronger than any other time point.",b8a50283-93ec-44e6-be37-7333405c2893

The major strengths of this study were the use of a nationally representative birth cohort of the white British population born in the early post World War II period(  19  ,  22  ) and detailed repeated measures of dietary intake as assessed by diet diaries over a 24–28-year period. Our sample for this study had a slightly healthier lifestyle (i.e. smoked less, exercised more and had a lower BMI) compared with the remaining study participants. As this was an observational study, exact replication of the original Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet(  4  ) was not possible. However, we used the Fung Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index(  5  ) which has been shown to perform equally well as other indices(  44  ).",06dc997f-7eff-4c5a-85dc-f5992662f663
31,discussion8," Although we did not observe major changes in adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet over time, a previous study demonstrated that participants of National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) have healthier diets the older they become(  26  ). Cautious interpretation of study findings are required since calculation of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet in this study is relative to this specific study sample. For example, if the majority of the study sample did not eat in accordance with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, even those in the highest quintile would have low adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which may have weakened observed associations.",dcc229a3-f3b7-4e01-8fda-9f9b018758ef
32,discussion9," Miller and colleagues published standards for maximum scores for defining a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet using different Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) indices, including the Fung index(  44  ). The participants in the highest Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) quintile in our study were not quite meeting these standards(  44  ). For example, participants in the top quintile in our study consumed approximately 3 servings of fruit/d, 2·6 servings of vegetables/d (one portion is equivalent to 80 g) and 3 servings of wholegrains/d (one portion is equivalent to 16 g) per 8368 kJ (2000 kcal). The maximum standard servings/d based on 8368 kJ (2000 kcal) as outlined by Miller are;≥4 servings of fruit/d, ≥3 vegetables/d and ≥4 servings of wholegrains/d.",2228130e-a599-4139-b15e-cd61cd4c098a
33,discussion10,"  In conclusion, we found observational evidence for an association between adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet over an approximately 30-year period and better conventional CV-risk factors. We also demonstrated an association between long-term adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet and two vascular function markers, cIMT and pulse wave velocity (PWV), at 60–64 years which was not explained by the conventional risk factors. This study provides further evidence for the beneficial role of a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet in CVD risk reduction; however replication in other longitudinal observational cohorts is required.",ffe61ab1-5e30-4d95-80f7-6aafd75c5366
