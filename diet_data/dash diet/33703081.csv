0,background0, Chronic conditions are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide and respective data on dietary patterns remain scant. The present study aimed to investigate dietary patterns and identify sociodemographic factors associated with Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) scores within a multi-ethnic population with various chronic conditions. ,bfcfc3ef-da82-4149-9f8a-f553c74da887
1,methods0," Participants and procedures  The data for this research comes from a population based, cross-sectional study lasting from February 2019 to September 2020 aimed at evaluating the Knowledge, Practice and Attitudes towards Diabetes Mellitus (DM) amongst residents of Singapore aged 18 years and above. A more to detailed methodology of the study can be found in an earlier paper [32]. The sample was randomly selected via a disproportionate stratified sampling design according to ethnicity (Chinese, Malay, Indian, Others) and age groups (18-34, 35-49, 50-64, 65 and above) from a national population registry database of all citizens and permanent residents within Singapore. The study oversampled certain minority populations, such as Malay and Indian ethnicity, as well as those above 65 years of age, in order to ensure sufficient sample size and to improve the reliability of the parameter estimates for these subgroups.",778e6ed7-b730-434d-898e-cbd13fea6082
2,methods1,"  Citizens and permanent residents who were randomly selected were sent notification letters followed by home visits by a trained interviewer from a survey research company to obtain their informed consent to participate in the study. Face-to-face interviews with those who were agreeable to participate were conducted in their preferred language (English, Mandarin, Malay, or Tamil). Responses were captured using computer assisted personal interviewing. Individuals who were unable to be contacted due to incomplete or incorrect addresses, were living outside of the country, or were incapable of attending the interview due to severe physical or mental conditions, language barriers, or were institutionalized or hospitalized at the time of the survey were excluded from the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all respondents prior to the survey, and for those aged 18 to 20 years, parental consent was sought as the official age of majority in Singapore is 21 years and above.",5d4f5a47-1244-4ddf-8db2-20d4eadc4d55
3,methods2,"  Measures  Socio-demographic information and body mass index  Socio-demographic data on age (18-34, 35-49, 50-64 and 65 and above), gender (Female, Male), ethnicity (Chinese, Malay, Indian and Others), education (Primary and below, Secondary, Pre-U/Junior College, Vocational Institute/ITE, Diploma, Degree, professional certifications and above), marital status (Single, Married/Cohabiting, Divorced/Separated/Widowed), employment (Employed, Economically inactive and Unemployed), and monthly personal income (Below $2,000 and no income, $2,000-$3,999, $4,000-$5,999, $6000-$9,999 and $10,000 and above) was collected. Further, Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) scores were categorised into four groups based on World Health Organization guidelines: ‘underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2), ‘normal range’ (≥ 18.5 kg/m2 and < 25 kg/m2), ‘overweight’ (≥ 25 kg/m2 and < 30 kg/m2), and ‘obese’ (>30 kg/m2) [33].",d2a93e92-d6d5-4eaf-a357-52e7725172b6
4,methods3,"  Diet screener  The diet screener comprises a list of 30 food/beverage items, that respondents’ rate on a 10-point scale ranging from ‘never/rarely’ to ‘6 or more times per day’, the frequency at which they consumed a particular food/beverage within the last one year [27]. Accordingly, scores obtained from the list of 30 food/beverage items are categorised into each of the seven intake components: fruit, vegetables, nuts/legumes, whole grains, red and processed meat, low fat dairy, and sweetened beverages. Based upon the scores within each of the seven components, participants received a score between 1 and 5 corresponding to the quintile of the intake they fall in, with reverse scoring utilized for meat and sweetened beverages. Followingly. these seven quintile scores are summed to form the overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. Standard serving sizes were indicated for each food/beverage item to facilitate this process.",92c8458f-d423-4b0a-8d79-6b3016f13cd5
5,methods4," Intake frequencies were standardised to a number of servings per day for each food/beverage item. Fung et al. [34] provides a detailed description on the calculation of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores. The diet screener was interviewer-administered.  Chronic physical conditions  A modified version of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)) version 3.0 [35] checklist of chronic conditions was used, and the respondents were asked to report any of the conditions listed in the checklist. The question was read as, “I am going to read to you a list of health problems some people have.",f6544283-f756-478b-833d-e2c8456c2eee
6,methods5," Has a doctor ever told you that you have any of the following chronic medical conditions?” This was followed by a list of 18 chronic physical conditions (such as asthma, high blood sugar, hypertension, arthritis, cancer, neurological condition, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, heart disease, back problems, stomach ulcer, chronic inflamed bowel, thyroid disease, kidney failure, migraine headaches, chronic lung disease, and hyperlipidaemia) which were considered to be prevalent among Singapore’s population. If the participant gave a positive response for any of the conditions listed, they were then asked, “How old were you when you were diagnosed with the medical condition?” and, “Did you receive any treatment for it at any time during the past 12 months?”.

7,analysis0," Analyses in the present study were conducted with Stata version 15. In order to ensure representativeness of the data to the general population, survey weights were used to account for complex survey design. Means and standard deviations are provided for continuous variables, while frequencies and percentages are presented for categorical variables. In order to examine the variables associated with the total Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, four linear regressions were conducted (within the total sample, and the three subgroups of no chronic condition, one chronic condition and multimorbidity) with the following predictor variables: age, gender, ethnicity, education, marital status, employment status, personal income, Body Mass Index (BMI) and chronic conditions. Statistical significance was set at the conventional alpha level of p < 0.05, using two-tailed tests. ",b6d24ed5-9515-4ed8-8d9f-6dd90b96b562

Chinese respondents made up 75.8% of the sample distribution, Malays 12.7%, Indians 8.6%, and Others 2.9%. 51.6% of the respondents were female, and Body Mass Index (BMI) scores indicated that 53.4% of the respondents were in the normal range based on World Health Organization (WHO) Body Mass Index (BMI) classification. 46.2% had no chronic physical condition, 26.3% had one chronic physical condition, and 27.2% had two or more chronic physical conditions. The most prevalent chronic condition was hyperlipidemia (22.2%, n=640), followed by hypertension (20.6%, n=668), high blood sugar (10.5%, n=465), back problems (10.2%, n=252), and asthma (9.9%, n=324).

12,discussion0," The current study found that 42.9% of the population had no chronic physical condition, 26.3% had one chronic physical condition, and 30.5% had multiple chronic conditions (MCC). Overall, people with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) had demonstrated better dietary practices in terms of number of servings taken per day for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) components. In the context of Singapore, this could be attributed to various initiatives and support received from primary care providers. Firstly, the focus upon nudging and facilitating healthier dietary choices is seen across the multitude of nationwide health promotion campaigns. One such example relates to the “Healthier Dining Programme” launched in 2014 which provides incentives to restaurants offering 500-calorie meals. Essentially, consumers are “nudged” towards choosing such healthier meal options that are identified with a “Healthier Choice Symbol” on menus in these restaurants (36).",c3282916-008d-482f-b03e-449b4b4dbcae
13,discussion1," More importantly, better dietary practices amongst persons with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) can also be attributed to the role of primary care providers as outlined in several guidelines and regulations. Of relevance, the “Chronic Disease Management Programme” introduced earlier in 2006 represents one avenue aiding in the management of chronic physical conditions in Singapore [37]. Briefly, the programme involves structured disease management aimed at reducing out-of-pocket payments for outpatient treatments required in the management of an individual’s chronic diseases [38]. In terms of dietary habits, healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians and dieticians) provide individuals with practical dietary guidelines aimed at making adjustments to current dietary choices [39].",71ed2ea8-4d96-47dc-93c2-26455444e405
14,discussion2," Taken together, the combination of both healthier dietary practices campaigns and prevention efforts in the clinical setting provide plausible explanations to the present finding of better dietary patterns observed in persons with multiple chronic conditions (MCC).  Findings from the present study lends further support to several well-established risk factors associated with diet quality in the extant literature. Within the study population, females and those of older age reported better diet quality based on their respective Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores. In a study determining the demographic profile of fast-food consumers amongst a Singapore population, Whitton et al. [40] reported that older adults consumed lesser fast food in comparison to their younger counterparts. As highlighted by Allman-Farinelli et al. [41], this is consistent with the notion that younger individuals demonstrate certain dietary habits that reduce overall diet quality.",2cc87783-d407-4832-8616-285f3237dfc8
15,discussion3," Food and beverages with high saturated fat, sugar and sodium contents such as those purchased at quick service restaurants feature prominently in the younger population’s diet across many countries such as USA, UK and Australia [41].  Gender differences in terms of dietary patterns was also demonstrated to be consistent with prior studies; where women tended to report better diet quality in comparison to men. For example, in Montreal, women’s diets were closer to recommendations for vegetables, fruits, and sodium intake as compared to men [42]. As demonstrated in prior literature, women generally reported being more invested in relation to food-related matters and having better knowledge in terms of food and nutrition [43, 44]. Additionally, women reported consuming higher intakes of fruits and vegetables, dietary fibre, and lower intakes of fat and salt [43, 45].",c66de00b-73e9-49be-9dd3-78541db14d97
16,discussion4," Taken together, it follows that greater importance attributed by women to their diet correspondingly translates into better dietary practices.  Across the sample population, ethnicity was also identified to be significantly associated with diet quality. Among the major ethnic groups in Singapore, Indians reported having healthier diet based on respective Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores. This is consistent with the healthy dietary pattern as outlined in the National Nutrition Survey conducted in 2010 [46], with Indians consuming the most bread and breakfast cereals, vegetable dishes, fruit, milk and dairy products and fewer eggs, poultry and meat dishes.  Diet and nutrition represent important factors in both promotion and maintenance of good health throughout the entire life course. We identified several important factors associated with diet quality among persons with no chronic conditions and one chronic condition.",c75d0d25-98b8-436e-8017-0d34b046efc6
17,discussion5," Within these subgroups, education level was significantly associated with diet quality. Specifically, those with less than a degree reported having poorer diet quality. Similar findings regarding educational level have been reported elsewhere; adults with a college diploma in USA demonstrated having a better overall diet quality as compared to all other education levels [47]. Therein, it has been posited that education might be associated not only with increased nutritional knowledge, but could also be an indicator of ability to translate such nutritional knowledge into better dietary practices throughout the person’s lifetime [47]. Lastly, it was interesting to observe that Body Mass Index (BMI) was not a factor associated with diet quality in the present study. In current literature, it has been evidenced that individuals with chronic conditions generally reported higher-than-normal Body Mass Index (BMI) (48).",c9786007-dcaa-4396-b561-cbd76a7c1f2f
18,discussion6," Accordingly, multiple studies have also demonstrated that healthier dietary patterns are associated with lower Body Mass Index (BMI) [49, 50]. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the use of self-reported chronic conditions may plausibly have resulted in reporting bias – underestimating the true prevalence of chronic conditions and therein, an underestimation of the strength of the association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and diet quality.  The present study was a nationwide survey conducted in four different languages (English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil) to address potential language barriers for participation in a multi-ethnic population. Additionally, the use of a large sample size, randomised design and survey weighted analysis improves the overall reliability of the present results. Nonetheless, several limitations of the present study warrant comment and conclusions drawn should be considered in light of these limitations.",b7c28eff-3303-4aec-9609-c0a5e03d68cf
19,discussion7," Firstly, given that the present study adopts a cross-sectional design, we are not able to establish any causal relationship between dietary pattern and chronic conditions. Secondly, the diet screener utilised is fundamentally based on the past-year self-reported diet recall of the respondent, with no correlation to any blood or urinary parameters. In that regard, we are not able to rule out the likelihood of recall bias in this self-reported format. Additionally, while it has been demonstrated that intakes such as whole grains and fruits can be adequately assessed in the present diet screener, more comprehensive and detailed instruments such as comprehensive food frequency questionnaires are still recommended for the assessment of other dietary components such as nutrients.  Conclusion  Chronic conditions remain the leading cause of death and disability worldwide.",40036da7-51f5-4103-9d75-076e1707122b
20,discussion8," Despite this, it should be noted that chronic conditions are largely preventable, and dietary patterns play a key role in such prevention activities. Given its significance, it reasons that establishing population norms in relation to dietary habits represent an important aspect of research in this area. Given the limited research conducted regarding dietary patterns of a multi-ethnic population, the present study furthers the understanding on the dietary patterns of a multi-ethnic population like Singapore. Notably, while the dietary patterns of individuals with chronic conditions are positive, the present study highlights areas of improvement for better dietary practices amongst individuals without chronic conditions.",57a3e105-5dd5-4a3c-880a-8722fe3667d4
21,discussion9," Given that individuals who are younger and healthy at present tended to have lower Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores, it is critical that efforts are directed towards monitoring less-than-ideal dietary practices given its significance towards the development of chronic conditions. As noted earlier, ongoing efforts such as the “Healthier Dining Programme” are initiatives aimed at providing healthier meals for individuals. Results on the dietary intakes as categorised by food groups such as fruits and vegetables provide up-to-date information which policymakers can utilise to modify ongoing initiatives and campaigns if necessary. In the global context, studies and reviews have generally reached the conclusion that there are some similarities in terms of dietary recommendations albeit minor differences when a country’s geographical environment and culture are taken into account [51, 52].",c91252cb-a71a-4b28-a480-7bc8bbf3d8ee
22,discussion10," Accordingly, information obtained from the present study may provide certain insights to international counterparts pertaining to the effectiveness of diet related policies and initiatives in Singapore. Such information may be useful in aiding policymakers with modifying or forming new polices to better suit their respective population. Taken together, the present study provides both local and international policymakers with up-to-date information on dietary patterns in Singapore to better support the design and evaluation of policies and initiatives.",198018d9-372c-4f73-9bdb-04b79431fc7e
