0,methods0," 2.1. Study Setting and Subjects  This 5-week randomized–controlled trial was conducted in the Physiotherapy Centre at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences in University Tunku Abdul Rahman, Sungai Long Kajang, Malaysia. G*power (F test) was used to calculate the sample size, based on the power analysis; a total of 42 participants were required for this study. The study subjects were reached through university portal, emails and posters for voluntary participation. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling as the study population required young adults with pre-hypertension. A total of 87 subjects were initially screened, out of which only 32 adults fit the eligibility criteria after they were administered the International Physical Activity Questionnaires (International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ)), Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q+) and measurement of body mass index (body mass index (BMI)).",a8162686-f5ef-4f55-ac4f-c2bd8b08b278
1,methods1," Using the computer-generated numbers, study participants (22 males and 10 females) were randomly allocated to 3 groups: the high intensity interval training (HIIT) group, continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) group and the control (control (CON)) group.  Inclusion criteria comprised both genders (unmarried), aged between 18 and 25 years old, who were physically inactive with an systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 120 and 139 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 80 and 89 mmHg. Participants with a known history of respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, overweight/obesity, psychological disorders, or musculoskeletal problems; those taking anti-hypertensive medications; and active smokers were excluded from this study.  The protocol was based on the Helsinki Declaration Accord (World Medical Association for Human Subjects).",2efdcdf0-a5c3-4c51-a66e-dbf75d9d4ce4
2,methods2," Moreover, prior ethical clearance was obtained from the Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman’s Scientific and Ethical Review Committee (U/SERC/77/20). Written informed consent was obtained from each participant after debriefing them about the benefits of the study, potential risks of muscle soreness, strict maintenance of data confidentiality and right to withdraw at any point from the study.  2.2. Body Mass Index and Blood Pressure Measurement  In addition to assessing body mass index (BMI) during the screening process, it was also measured at baseline to ensure no abrupt changes in body weight before study initiation and that participants were within the normal body mass index (BMI) range (18.5–24.9). body mass index (BMI) was recorded by measuring the participants’ body weight in kilograms and dividing it by their height squared (kg/m2).",7dec8e9d-4037-4e89-9ba2-c7df5094956b
3,methods3," The procedure was carried out early in the morning (8:30 am–9:00 am) using a calibrated seca 284 EMR (Hamburg, Germany) wireless measuring station for weight and height. Before measuring the body mass index (BMI), participants were instructed to remove any excess clothing, and to stand upright and barefooted on the measuring machine. An average of 3 measurements for both weight and height were calculated to assess the body mass index (BMI) score.  Following the standard procedure, participants’ BP from the right brachial artery was measured using an automated digital BP monitor (OMRON SEM-1, Kyoto, Kansai Japan) in the morning between 9:15 am and 10:15 am after 5 min of rest in a chair [26,27]. Each participant’s right arm was supported on the table at heart level, and both SPB and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured 3 times with a 5 min interval between each measurement in order to obtain the most accurate result.",7b9843f1-90f8-426f-812f-92633e58347a
4,methods4," If the differences between any of the 3 systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) readings were higher than 5 mmHg, the measurement was taken again after a 5 min interval, and the average reading with the least differences was taken into consideration. BP was measured at baseline before beginning the intervention and at the end of the 5-week intervention. The post-test measurement of BP was carried out in a similar way as recorded at baseline. In addition, the mean arterial pressure (mean arterial pressure (MAP)) was also estimated at baseline and at the end of intervention with the following formula:mean arterial pressure (MAP) = diastolic blood pressure (DBP) + 1/3(systolic blood pressure (SBP) − diastolic blood pressure (DBP))  2.3. Exercise Intervention Protocol  Before the first exercise session, the subjects’ heart rate (HR) was measured using a calibrated pulse oximeter (GIMA: Oxy-5-Plus Oximeter, Italy).",6b75bdff-d3e0-4b2f-b6e5-5983ce592015
5,methods5," The exercise HR (HRmax) of the participants in the high intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) groups was calculated using the newest age-based formula, [HRmax = 211 − (0.64 ∗ age)]. The exercise HR was then calculated using the Karvonen formula [Exercise HR = % of target intensity (HRreserve) + HRrest]. To prevent delayed-onset muscle soreness (delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)) and to acclimatize all the physically inactive participants in both exercise groups to the exercise regimen, a 1-week familiarization period was provided with a total of 3 exercise sessions on alternate days. Participants in both the experimental groups performed a 5 min warm-up session followed by 20 min of continuous running on a treadmill (BH LK-G6700 Pro Action, St. Charles, MI, USA) without inclination at 40–60% of their HR-reserve.",18b6932b-3b47-4be5-8d3e-0012cfa3ca63
6,methods6," Before ending the exercise session, a 5 min cool-down was performed by all participants by walking on the same treadmill at their own comfortable pace. A pulse oximeter (GIMA: Oxy-5-Plus Oximeter, Gessate, Milan, Italy) was placed on the participants’ index finger during the PA to monitor their exercise HR, in addition to using the treadmill’s inbuilt heart rate monitor. Differences in the exercise HR in both the monitoring methods were negligible throughout the training protocol. After the familiarization period of 1 week, the high intensity interval training (HIIT) group underwent 4 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) (3 times per week on alternate days excluding the weekends) consisting of 20 min of treadmill (BH LK-G6700 Pro Action, St. Charles, MI, USA) running with a 1:4 min work to rest ratio, an upper HR target at 80–85% of HR-reserve, and a lower HR target at 40–60% of HR-reserve.",9488aa9d-6ac2-440a-9a34-5b1d81073d56
7,methods7," The continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) group continued with 4 weeks of the same exercise protocol on the treadmill, which was carried out in the familiarization period at an intensity of 40–60% of their HR-reserve. Exercise HR during these 4 weeks of aerobic exercise training (aerobic exercise training (AET)) for both groups were monitored in the same way as stated above in the familiarization program. The indication for the termination of the exercise sessions was in accordance with ACSM’s guidelines. It was not feasible to blind the participants or therapists, as they both knew the type of intervention being received and delivered, respectively, but outcome assessors were blinded to control the detection bias.",4ed9175d-5447-49c2-816c-a3d2e2518025
8,methods8,"  The control (CON) group did not participate in any exercise program; they were instructed to follow a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) diet and restrict their sodium intake (<100 mmol/day) according to the JNV VIII guidelines. In addition to the distribution of the guidelines given, participants in the control (CON) group were reminded via telephone calls once weekly about the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and sodium restrictions to ensure that they were strictly following the guidelines.  All the participants in the 3 groups were instructed not to engage in any other form of PA during these 5 weeks to prevent any extraneous effect on the outcomes. In addition, to avoid the acute post-exercise effects on BP, participants were also instructed not to perform any exercise 24 h prior to the post-test BP measurement.",61b2708d-498e-4a28-813a-76b9bf716658
9,methods9," In accordance with the control (CON)SORT statement, a detailed description of this clinical trial is shown in Figure 1 below.  2.4. Statistical Analysis  The data were processed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS)) version 26.0. The Shapiro–Wilk test was first performed to check the normality assumption of data as it is required to fulfil the conditions of a paired sample t-test. The Shapiro–Wilk test (Table 1) demonstrated that data were normally distributed (p > 0.05) in all 3 groups with respect to the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) at baseline; therefore, these outcome measures were compared using the paired sample t-test to determine within-group differences. To evaluate between-group differences, a one-way ANOVA test was carried out.",01a88800-9960-43b8-8ab6-bc162298fbd5
10,methods10," The conditions to conduct the one-way ANOVA test were fulfilled, in which each group represented the qualitative variables, and the dependent variables, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), were quantitative variables. A post hoc test was further employed to assess which group differed significantly from the other two groups after performing the one-way ANOVA test. Results are presented as the mean ± SD for all the outcome measures. All reported probability values were 2-sided, and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  3. Results  3.1. Descriptive Statistics  At the beginning of this study, 32 participants were randomly assigned to the high intensity interval training (HIIT) (6 males and 6 females), continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) (6 males and 4 females) and control (CON) groups (10 males).",f6f99a95-be8d-403e-8ab8-c337eea76c7d
11,methods11," Two participants dropped out of the high intensity interval training (HIIT) group (both males) during the third and fourth weeks of training due to musculoskeletal injury. The mean ages of the participants in the high intensity interval training (HIIT), continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) and control (CON) groups were 21 ± 0.8, 19 ± 1.3 and 21 ± 1.0, respectively. Similarly, the mean body mass index (BMI)s measured at baseline were 20.8 ± 1.9, 21.7 ± 1.6 and 22.0 ± 1.9 for the high intensity interval training (HIIT), continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) and control (CON) groups, respectively. The body mass index (BMI) of the control (CON) group was slightly higher than that of the other two groups, which was most probably due to the fact that all the participants in the control (CON) group were males.  3.2.",b54356f8-63c2-4820-bba0-aeb55f65a006
12,methods12," Comparison within the Groups  Table 2 depicts that the control (CON) group had the highest baseline and post-intervention systolic blood pressure (SBP) mean values of 127.93 ± 5.09 mmHg and 128.37 ± 5.32 mmHg, respectively. The high intensity interval training (HIIT) group had the highest baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (78.57 ± 5.36 mmHg), and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) group had greater post-test diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (75.73 ± 4.26). At baseline, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was highest in the continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) group (93.20 ± 2.89) and greater in the control (CON) group (91.86 ± 4.18) post-test.  Table 3 illustrates the results of the paired sample t-test. In the control (CON) group, a mean difference of −0.43 (p-value = 0.718 > 0.05) for the SPB was observed, indicating a non-significant difference between the pre-systolic blood pressure (SBP) and post-systolic blood pressure (SBP).",d60c3a36-650c-44c3-b3f9-9ea55eaa64f6
13,methods13," For the diastolic blood pressure (DBP), a mean difference of 0.40 (p-value = 0.714 > 0.05) was found, showing no significant difference between the pre-diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and post-diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for control (CON) group. Similarly, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) did not exhibit any significant difference (mean = 0.11, p-value = 0.892). For the continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) group, a mean difference of 1.57 (p-value = 0.011 < 0.05) was observed in terms of systolic blood pressure (SBP), which was statistically significant. However, for the diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the mean difference between the pre- and post-tests was 1.50 (p-value = 0.161 > 0.05), depicting a non-significant difference between the pre-diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and post-diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) group.",889e6c44-4bce-42e4-b0fc-da8463876de6
14,methods14," The mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) group showed an insignificant reduction in the mean (1.49, p-value = 0.054). A mean difference of 3.76 (p-value = 0.002 < 0.05) was found in the high intensity interval training (HIIT) group for the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 2.93 (p-value = 0.002 < 0.05) for the diastolic blood pressure (DBP), indicating a statistically significant difference between the pre- and post-tests of both the SPB and DPB, respectively, in the high intensity interval training (HIIT) group. A similar result was noticed found in mean arterial pressure (MAP), with a significant mean difference of 3.05 (p-value < 0.0005).  3.3. Comparison between the Groups  For the systolic blood pressure (SBP), the F-test (one-way ANOVA) result was 5.02 (p-value = 0.014 < 0.05) (Table 4). Therefore, it can be concluded that there were significant differences in the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) across the three groups.",4adb5468-d20e-442e-ac64-ca999e7078c5
15,methods15," However, for the diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the F-test statistic was 1.87 (p-value = 0.173 > 0.05), indicating a non-significant difference among the three groups. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) F-test was 4.76 (p-value = 0.017 < 0.05), showing a significant difference between the 3 groups.  Since the one-way ANOVA test showed significant differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) across the three groups, a post hoc test (Tukey test) was performed to investigate which pairs of the groups were different in terms of the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean mean arterial pressure (MAP). We found that the systolic blood pressure (SBP) mean difference in the high intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) groups was statistically insignificant (p-value = 0.282 > 0.05) (Table 5).",58580bb7-239b-4430-b0db-d0616897341e
16,methods16," However, we noticed a significant systolic blood pressure (SBP) mean difference between the high intensity interval training (HIIT) group and the control (CON) group (p-value = 0.010 < 0.05), but the systolic blood pressure (SBP) mean difference between the continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) and control (CON) groups was statistically insignificant (p-value = 0.258 > 0.05). The mean arterial pressure (MAP) did not show any significant mean difference between the high intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) groups (p-value = 0.244 > 0.05) and between the continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) and control (CON) groups (p-value = 0.337 > 0.05). However, a significant mean difference in mean arterial pressure (MAP) was seen between the high intensity interval training (HIIT) and control (CON) groups (p-value = 0.013 < 0.05).",5e6b3200-1c14-4d89-bcb7-aae1e8cf9c8d
17,methods17," Hence, it can be deduced that high intensity interval training (HIIT) is more effective in reducing the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) compared to the continuous moderate intensity training (CMT).  4. Discussion  Earlier studies [28,29] broadly supported the improved cardiopulmonary benefits of high intensity interval training (HIIT) over continuous moderate intensity training (CMT). Nevertheless, no previous study has conspicuously explored high intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) outcomes in the pre-hypertensive young population by incorporating a comparator control (CON) group with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) protocol. Thus, the research provided valuable insights into the field of physical therapy and significantly contributed to the current body of scientific literature.",f2478a3e-561b-4862-a53c-4c91558e1c70
18,methods18," This study showed the beneficial effects of high intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) on the resting BP of physically inactive young adults with pre-hypertension. It is evident from the findings of the current study that both high intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) can reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly among pre-hypertensive young adults. The positive role of exercise training on BP can be perceived through its action on sympathetic activity, enhanced endothelial function and decreased oxidative stress, which cumulatively contributes to the prevention and treatment of hypertension [30].",0a6ad4c4-80e0-4220-a89e-e6914d0e0c07
19,methods19," In addition, PA may be accountable for reducing exercise-induced oxidative stress by producing an increased level of antioxidants, attenuating vascular and cardiac sympathetic activity, reducing serum vasoconstrictor factor levels and increasing endothelial dilating factors, which that consequently helps in lowering the peripheral vascular resistance and subsequently leads to improved BP [16,31]. A previous meta-analysis revealed that the two most prominent intervention protocols high intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) were effective in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) in adults with pre- to established hypertension [25]. Our findings correlate with a study that compared the effects of continuous and interval training in the management of hypertension, wherein researchers found a systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction in both experimental groups (−16.4 ± 13.2 mmHg and −13.9 ± 12.6 mmHg, respectively) [32].",a462fb6e-c9b9-498a-b5a7-7e47c6f4dc94
20,methods20," Similar results were also derived from the systematic review by Punia S et al. [33]. Our study revealed significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) after conducting 5 weeks of an aerobic exercise training (AET) (high intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT)) program. Therefore, in addition to lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) among the hypertensive population, high intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) can be useful tools in reducing the systolic blood pressure (SBP) among pre-hypertensive young adults.  The current study demonstrated a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) among the participants undergoing the high intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise protocol, whereas a non-significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was observed among the continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) and control groups.",d7d5c8f5-488e-45b5-bdcc-a14a699d0815
21,methods21," In [34], it is suggested that high intensity interval training (HIIT) demonstrated greater improvements in the endothelial function and arterial stiffness compared to continuous moderate intensity training (CMT). This explains the increased BP reduction in the high intensity interval training (HIIT) group as endothelium plays a pivotal role in the homeostasis and maintenance of vascular tonus, which may be a contributing factor in BP reduction. A recent randomized clinical trial also revealed similar results, where the authors found a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) but a non-significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [35].",37caae5f-3004-4b54-ba94-052a6965d2df
22,methods22," Although the decrease in the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of the continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) group was statistically non-significant in this study, if given a longer intervention period, there would be a more obvious result, as most studies have confirmed a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) following 8 or more weeks of continuous exercise in hypertensive and normotensive adults [32,36]. Interestingly, in the current study, within a time frame of 5 weeks, high intensity interval training (HIIT) was shown to be effective in reducing diastolic blood pressure (DBP) significantly. Therefore, high intensity interval training (HIIT) could be a better option in controlling the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of pre-hypertensive young adults.  mean arterial pressure (MAP) measures the pressure necessary for the adequate perfusion of the organs of the whole body. Therefore, it could be a better indicator of perfusion than systolic blood pressure (SBP).",d9c8a39a-0455-42c8-a8da-7fc38c9eddc7
23,methods23," High mean arterial pressure (MAP) can be detrimental, leading to morbid conditions such as ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial infarction and stroke. high intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention in this current study also demonstrated significantly greater reductions in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) in comparison to continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) (3.05 vs. 1.49). Similar findings were reported in past studies, wherein high intensity interval training (HIIT) led to notable reductions in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) among pre-hypertensive subjects [37] and sedentary individuals [38,39]. Overall, the high intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise resulted in a significant BP reduction and a favorable alteration in mean arterial pressure (MAP), thus showing a positive cardiovascular response post-intervention.",9d9a4fbc-23dc-40b9-80ac-8a7096095408
24,methods24," However, further studies are required to evaluate the potential mechanisms contributing to these physiological responses and changes in the pre-hypertensive population.  high intensity interval training (HIIT) interventions are considered to be more effective and time-efficient interventions for BP and aerobic capacity level improvements as compared to other exercises [40]. Wahl P et al. [41] found that high intensity interval training (HIIT) stimulated a transient increase in the circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor. Thus, it can be postulated that high intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention reduces BP by actively promoting and stimulating the angiogenic factors.",7a351c7e-539d-451d-af48-206a8f6b3525
25,methods25," A study comparing high intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) [16] showed that high intensity interval training (HIIT) is far superior in lowering BP compared to continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) due to three factors: improving cardiorespiratory fitness, hormonal response and nitric oxide response, which is a mediator of vasodilation in blood vessels that plays a major role in BP control. It has been stated that high intensity interval training (HIIT) interventions that last for 4–12 weeks are able to produce a larger decrease in SPB (−3.63 mmHg) than other forms of exercise [40].",9ef76021-2264-407a-8bd3-d4746eef5f58
26,methods26," Previous studies [16,17,18] also support the finding that high intensity interval training (HIIT) is superior to continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) in improving cardiorespiratory fitness and reducing BP among normotensive and hypertensive individuals, but its efficacy in reducing BP among the pre-hypertensive population requires further investigation. In the current study, there was a significant difference in the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) across the three groups, high intensity interval training (HIIT), continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) and control (CON), as revealed by the ANOVA test. Further analysis via a post hoc test demonstrated a significant mean difference in the systolic blood pressure (SBP) between the high intensity interval training (HIIT) group and control (CON) group (p-value = 0. 010 < 0.05).",34c56b42-8117-4336-a4e6-1bbda3ac5841
27,methods27," However, there was an insignificant mean difference in the systolic blood pressure (SBP) between the continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) and control (CON) group participants (p-value = 0.282 > 0.05). Additionally, high intensity interval training (HIIT) was found to be effective in reducing the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) significantly (p-value = 0.002 < 0.05). Although PA has been associated with reduced BP, there can be some variations due to different training modalities, exercise prescriptions, intensities, frequencies and durations of intervention [34]. Nevertheless, the current study clearly demonstrates that high intensity interval training (HIIT) is superior to continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) in controlling the progression of pre-hypertension towards hypertension in Malaysian young adults.

28,methods28," [43] revealed that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and sodium restriction have significant effect on the reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and HR among hypertensive patients. A recent meta-analysis also revealed similar observations [44]. Therefore, a possible reason that there was no reduction in SPB or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the control (CON) group could be non-adherence to the diet protocol, even after weekly reminders via phone calls to the participants to ensure that they were strictly adhering to the regimen.",68f2604b-1fed-4216-9024-2f5f0c8ea4bf
29,methods29," Although high intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) groups were not instructed to follow the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and sodium restriction as the researchers aimed to determine the effectiveness of high intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) solely, a significant systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction and a non-significant diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reduction were observed among the participants of the continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) group, whereas in the high intensity interval training (HIIT) group, both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly reduced after 5 weeks.",1f13716f-9f4f-4f33-942a-2aece737b6d3
30,methods30," In conclusion, the study results indicate a higher efficacy of high intensity interval training (HIIT) over continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) even in the absence of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet to control the resting BP in the pre-hypertensive young adults.  5. Strengths, Limitations and Recommendations  Due to the time constraint and limited resources, the researchers were only able to recruit 32 participants for this research. However, this was a hypothesis-generating study and differed methodologically; therefore, even with the limited sample size, this research provided a deeper insight into the cardioprotective role of exercise training in BP. Second, the high intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) groups each consisted of only 4 and 6 females in the respective groups, whereas the control (CON) group consisted of all males.",e9321d72-029b-4269-b8d0-4e86f5d5f53c
31,methods31," This is due to the fact that during the screening process, many female participants were under hypotensive or normotensive categories, and after screening, eligible participants were divided randomly into three groups. The dietary intake of the participants in the control (CON) group may have also played a significant role regarding controlling BP, since it was not possible to directly observe and monitor their adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and sodium restriction. Therefore, future studies with a larger sample size, a longer intervention duration, and the stringent control of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet plan are highly recommended. Furthermore, high intensity interval training (HIIT) with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet plan could be a better approach towards controlling pre-hypertension in a short period of time.  6.",e82fd3eb-9c0d-4a28-b2d8-f5aa0ef4e1f5
32,methods32," Conclusions  high intensity interval training (HIIT) can effectively reduce both the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of healthy, physically inactive pre-hypertensive young adults, but continuous moderate intensity training (CMT) reduced only the systolic blood pressure (SBP) in this study. Therefore, high intensity interval training (HIIT) could be a promising alternative intervention in BP reduction and thus could be functional in preventing the progression of pre-hypertension towards hypertension among physically inactive young adults.
