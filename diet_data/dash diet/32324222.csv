0,methods0," An economic evaluation was performed to evaluate the costs and benefits of higher adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation for renal transplant recipients (RTR) in the University Medical Center Groningen (University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)), the Netherlands. The cohort used for this analysis was based on the renal transplant recipients (RTR) population of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) (Table 1), a part of the TransplantLines cohort (NCT03272841) [18]. While the actual cohort size was 632 subjects, economic evaluation was performed for 1000 renal transplant recipients (RTR).  This economic evaluation consisted of a cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis (budget impact analysis (BIA)). The focus of the analyses was the implementation of the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation to reduce death with a functioning graft (DWFG) and renal graft failure.",49fe0aa8-3732-4b10-b34d-7db08bf5e39d
1,methods1," To address dietary adherence, it was assumed that the number of visits to a dietician was increased from one to eight. The amount of dietician visits in this model is arbitrary as there are no data available regarding the effect on adherence of increased visits to a dietician. It is also possible to further increase the number of visits or for example use mobile applications. Normal adherence to the diet intervention was compared with increased adherence. The cost differences and clinical differences were assessed, and if not dominant (lower costs and clinically superior), the ratio of the differences was presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER)) cost per quality-adjusted life year (quality adjusted life year (QALY)) gained. The societal perspective was used in order to address all relevant costs and effects.  2.1. The Model  A cohort Markov model was developed using Microsoft Excel 365 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA).",a55c262f-a777-4853-9b8f-bf86a34ecd5e
2,methods2," This Markov model was used to simulate the life course of renal transplant recipients (RTR), represented in a Markov trace. As recommended by the Dutch guidelines for economic evaluations in healthcare [19], a time horizon was chosen covering the expected lifetime with a cycle length of one year. Costs were discounted by 4% and health outcomes by 1.5% [19]. The model consists of three main health states through which the renal transplant recipients (RTR) transition (Figure 1):(1) Functioning graft  (2) Graft failure  (3) Death  Patients were able to receive a re-transplantation, and, to include this in the model, extra states were added to differentiate between the first time they are in a state (FG1, GF1) and the second time (FG2, GF2) (Figure 1). It was only possible to receive one re-transplantation given that receiving a third kidney is very unlikely [20]. Notably, in the TransplantLines cohort study, patients with a third kidney only made up only 0.",4b3e5f4d-c5e6-4ac1-984d-144799424274
3,methods3,"6% of transplanted patients and similar numbers are mentioned in literature [21]. The relatively high age of the patient cohort also reduces their chances of receiving a third kidney. Like the initial transplant, each re-transplant has a probability of primary non-function, which results in transition from GF1 to GF2. To address the fact that events tend to take place in the middle of the year, a mid-cycle correction was applied. As the study population was the renal transplant recipients (RTR) population of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), all patients started in the functioning graft state (FG1).  2.2. The Intervention  For the economic evaluation, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation were tested as separate interventions. The dietary intervention consisted of increasing the number of visits to the dietician from one to eight dietician visits.",28961034-dafa-40b5-bc9e-32212d07f775
4,methods4," Patients in the renal transplant recipients (RTR) population of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) were placed in one of three groups according to their adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, similarly they were placed in one of three groups according to their intake of potassium [12]. The potassium intake was based on a 24 h urine sample. Dietary intake for calculating adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was determined using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire [22]. Adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was subsequently calculated using a previously described method which scores the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet adherence ranging from 8 to 40 [13]. The cut-off values for each group were determined by splitting the renal transplant recipients (RTR) population for each diet into three equally sized groups.",47c37c78-801c-40b1-a7fc-228e33cca45a
5,methods5," For the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet it was impossible to create three equally sized groups due to an uneven distribution. For both interventions, group 1 had the lowest adherence/intake, group 2 reflected the average, and group 3 had the highest. The mean daily potassium intake was 1873 mg, 2772 mg, and 3882 mg for group 1, group 2, and group 3, respectively. The mean adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was scored at 18.5, 24.0, and 29.5 for group 1, group 2, and group 3, respectively. Patients in group 1 had the highest risk of death with a functioning graft (DWFG) and renal graft failure compared to group 2 and 3. For all groups of both diets, a separate Markov trace was calculated where only their respective transition probabilities for death with a functioning graft (DWFG) and renal graft failure differ.",6d2b9901-e3ba-47c8-950d-baff26dea10c
6,methods6," This resulted in a total of six Markov traces, each with a total cost and total quality adjusted life year (QALY)s: three traces for the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and three for the potassium supplementation diet.  It was assumed that only the patients in group 1 would receive the dietary intervention, as it might be expected that greatest benefit could be achieved for these patients. Therefore, in the situation without any dietary intervention 100% of patients in the model are in group 1. With the implementation of the dietary intervention, more patients would follow the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or potassium supplementation, which was assumed to result in fewer patients in group 1 and more patients in group 2 and 3. The patients from group 1 were equally divided across group 2 and group 3. In the model it is assumed that this transition to another group happens instantly, assuming an immediate effect of the dietary intervention.",20f098da-0205-4dcf-9b42-8efa595ccada
7,methods7," For the cost-effectiveness analysis, the percentage of patients in group 1 was varied from 0% to 100%. Table 2 provides an overview of the adherence of the three groups to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and for potassium supplementation. For both diets, incremental costs and effects were determined separately.  Incremental costs or savings for renal transplant recipients (RTR)s on the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet were determined by calculating the total costs for both the situation without intervention and with intervention using Equation (1), the percentages in Table 3, and the three Markov traces for the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Incremental quality adjusted life year (QALY)s for the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet were calculated similarly using Equation (2).",4bbe6123-0a2b-4f23-8ce9-3bb6e52fe6d6
8,methods8," To calculate incremental costs and quality adjusted life year (QALY)s for renal transplant recipients (RTR)s on potassium supplementation, Equations (1) and (2) were used, together with Table 2 for the percentages and the three Markov traces for potassium supplementation.

Transition Probabilities  The probabilities at which patients moved from one state to the other were determined using patient data from the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) cohort and literature (Table 3).",56c1f726-da2e-41fa-a379-a924c2869007
9,methods9," The probability of death with a functioning graft (DWFG) and renal graft failure were based on the Kaplan Meier survival curves (using time to graft failure and death with a functioning graft (DWFG) data), with survival analysis performed using R and RStudio [25]. These survival curves were fitted with a Weibull distribution, based on the best visual fit and Akaike information criterion (Akaike information criterion (AIC)) and Bayesian information criterion (Bayesian information criterion (BIC)) scores, and the parameters of the distribution were used to extrapolate the survival curves to the length of the model (Table S1). This analysis was performed separately for each of the three groups for both the potassium supplementation and the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. From these survival curves the annual transition probabilities were calculated.",6d2ac82d-425b-4185-8d45-a5be7858df81
10,methods10," When the extrapolation crosses the background mortality of the Dutch population, it was assumed that the probabilities would converge; this method was used as the baseline for the model [26].  The probability of re-transplantation and death on dialysis were based on literature [23,24]. For the re-transplantation probability, it was assumed that the probability would linearly decline after age 65 to zero at age 80.  2.4. Costs  The perspective of this analysis was a societal perspective; therefore, both direct medical costs and indirect costs were accounted for (Table 4). All costs were adjusted for inflation to reflect 2017 euros; this index year was chosen because the main dataset used for this study was updated to 2017 [18]. Where relevant, costs were acquired from the Dutch costing manual for health economic evaluations [27]. The health states functioning graft and graft failure had corresponding costs for transplantation upkeep and dialysis, respectively.",b570c2da-ec34-4da7-b617-ec2d030e7ece
11,methods11," Transitioning from one health state to another also has associated costs: cost of graft failure, transplantation, and death. The friction cost method was used to assess productivity losses, as recommended by the Dutch guidelines. The percentage of patients working in the functioning graft state was used as a reference. When a patient moves from the functioning graft state to the graft failure state, this would incur costs due to productivity loss, but when a patient moves from the graft failure state to the functioning graft state, this would result in savings due to productivity gain. Dietary costs associated with increased adherence to group 2 and group 3 were also included. Dutch data regarding the extra cost of the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet were unavailable, however an article from the United Kingdom estimated the extra costs at around 18% comparing the lowest quintile to the highest [20].",feb46410-0d57-45c8-bedf-3524556f5c24
12,methods12," Based on the expert opinion of the authors, the extra costs associated with the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet were estimated at one euro per day. When comparing this to the average that Dutch citizens spend on food (six to seven euros per day), this amounts to an increase between approximately 14 and 17% [28]. The extra costs for potassium supplementation were calculated based on the potassium deficit that group 1 (mean daily intake of 1873 mg) had compared to group 2 and group 3 (a daily deficit between 899 mg and 2009 mg). As the Dutch daily recommended intake of potassium is 3500 mg and the Institute of Medicine recommends an even higher intake of 4700 mg per day, this can be considered a deficit [29,30]. Dietary costs are only incurred while a patient has a functioning graft, since these dietary changes should be avoided while on dialysis.",759f6c68-3244-44bd-b121-593945dcc710
13,methods13,"  Increased potassium intake requires monitoring of the potassium levels, and it was assumed that these costs are included in the transplantation upkeep costs, as these include laboratory and diagnostic costs [23]. Since monitoring potassium levels is already part of standard procedure, we assumed that it would not be necessary to use separate costs for monitoring the potassium levels.  For each dietary group (Markov trace), all costs were summed up annually and then discounted. This led to a total cost for each of the groups. Considering the ratio of the groups (i.e., the adherence and the number of patients in each group), the costs were summed up accordingly.  2.5. Utilities  Utility values for each of the health states were used to determine the clinical effectiveness of the new intervention, expressed in quality adjusted life year (QALY)s (Table 5).",a745fc74-f906-49e1-8b9e-d4a2d7501059
14,methods14," For the graft failure state, the health utility value was calculated with regard to the proportion of patients on HD (86%) and PD (14%) [35]. The utility values were calculated using the EQ-5D score. For each dietary group (Markov trace), the utility values were summed up annually and then discounted, resulting in the total amount of quality adjusted life year (QALY)s for each group. Considering the ratio of the groups (i.e., the adherence and the number of patients in each group), the quality adjusted life year (QALY)s were summed up accordingly.  2.6. Sensitivity Analyses  To analyse the robustness of the model and the results, a multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis (probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA)) and a univariate deterministic sensitivity analysis (deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA)) were performed. An adherence for group 1 of 0% was assumed for both the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation.",01bb9c2c-a2f0-4d06-9cf5-f5f96f586fa3
15,methods15," The deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) consisted of varying each parameter separately between the lowest and highest value of the 95% confidence interval. If the confidence interval was not available, a standard error of 25% of the parameter’s value was assumed, which was then used to calculate the 95% confidence interval. For the sensitivity analysis of the Weibull extrapolation, a Cholesky decomposition was calculated, from which the variance was determined. Results of the deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) analysis were plotted in a tornado diagram. For the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), all parameters were varied based on their respective distributions: beta distributions for the utilities, and percentage working; a gamma distribution for all the costs; and a normal distribution for the time spent in hospital, number of visits to the dietician, and transition probabilities.",607c80ae-f4d8-447b-b719-28d09eb62d51
16,methods16," For the three dietary groups, Monte Carlo simulations were performed with 10,000 iterations each. Results were plotted in a cost-effectiveness plane with a willingness-to-pay (willingness to pay (WTP)) threshold of €20,000/quality adjusted life year (QALY); this threshold was used, because it is recommended for prevention interventions by the Dutch National Healthcare Institute [37]. To address the cost-effectiveness at different willingness to pay (WTP) thresholds, the results of the Monte Carlo simulation were plotted in a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. All plots were created using R and RStudio [25].  2.7. Budget Impact Analysis  To determine the short-term costs/savings of the implementation of this new dietary intervention, a budget impact analysis (BIA) was performed in Microsoft Excel 365 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). The eligible population that can use this new intervention is all current and new renal transplant recipients (RTR).",378f2c4b-07d7-49fc-b5b5-481a17834172
17,methods17," The prevalence (n = 11,306) and incidence (904 new transplantations annually) were acquired from the Dutch Renal Registry (Renine) [38]. It was assumed that all patients will take the new dietary intervention, but that adherence will vary. A five-year time horizon was used with a payer’s perspective. To calculate the budget impact, the total number of patients was multiplied by the cost of the intervention per patient.  3. Results  3.1. Cost-Utility Analysis  To determine the cost and effects of implementing this new dietary intervention, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. The results for the adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation are shown in Table 6 and Table 7, respectively.",c4405419-1396-4272-b6fd-45f45317be1a
18,methods18," At a threshold of €20,000/quality adjusted life year (QALY) (the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold in the Netherlands for prevention interventions), both the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and potassium supplementation diets are cost-effective at 0% adherence to group 1. Potassium supplementation is dominant to the normal situation with incremental quality adjusted life year (QALY)s of 2901 and incremental costs of €−1,217,803. The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is dominant to the current standard of care with incremental quality adjusted life year (QALY)s of 1880 and incremental costs of €−27,934,786. With a stepwise increase in group 1 adherence of 10%, both dietary interventions remained cost-effective. To conclude, at a baseline of 0% adherence to group 1, both dietary interventions are dominant, and they remain cost-effective even if the adherence to group 1 increases.",2a0d12d9-1266-4213-b689-4640583db8c1
19,methods19,"  The discounted costs for each of the different cost categories comparing the situation without the dietary intervention to the situation where there is 0% adherence to group, 1 for both the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation, are shown in Tables S2 and S3, respectively. Most costs are caused by the upkeep of both the functioning graft and failed graft.  3.2. Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis  To address possible uncertainty in the parameters used in the model, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed. For the baseline adherence of 0% for group 1, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed with 10,000 iterations for both the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and potassium supplementation diets.",4077b053-c46a-41c2-a041-b564cad58996
20,methods20," Figure 2A,B shows the cost-effectiveness planes for the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and for potassium supplementation, where it is shown that most outcomes fall either in the north-east or south-east quadrant. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves have also been calculated for both simulations. With a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of €20,000/quality adjusted life year (QALY), 98.8% of outcomes are cost-effective for potassium supplementation, and 99.7% of outcomes are cost-effective for the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. With an adherence of 0% to group 1 and a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 0, 49.1% of outcomes are cost-effective for potassium supplementation, and 85.1% of outcomes are cost-effective for the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.",b1ef8f1d-78f7-4e5d-a7e5-660b0816a859
21,methods21," The corresponding cost-effectiveness acceptability curves for an adherence of 0% to group 1 are also shown in Figure 2C,D To conclude, with a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of €20,000/quality adjusted life year (QALY), both the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and potassium supplementation diets are likely to be cost-effective or even cost-saving.  3.3. Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis  To determine whether single parameters had a strong effect on the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), a deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) was performed. Figure 3 shows the 15 most influential parameters in a tornado diagram. Values were compared to the baseline incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), which was dominant for both the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and for potassium supplementation.",513a9a92-8f0a-46f2-bad3-6519f7b11232
22,methods22," For the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet intervention, the upper limits of both the group 1 death with a functioning graft (DWFG) probability and the group 1 GF probability were the only parameters that caused a positive incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) due to the incremental costs becoming positive. The parameter with the strongest effect was the upper limit of the group 1 death with a functioning graft (DWFG) probability. All other parameters shown in Figure 3A had a limited effect on the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER). For the potassium intervention, the effect on the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was lower when compared to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH). The parameters with the strongest effect were the group 1 death with a functioning graft (DWFG) and group 1 GF. All other parameters shown in Figure 3B had a limited effect on the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER).",da7e1a4f-488b-42db-88bb-7de91c1fb39a
23,methods23,"  To conclude, the group 1 death with a functioning graft (DWFG) and group 1 GF probabilities had the strongest effect on the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) in both the potassium and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) interventions. However, for both the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) remained under the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of €20,000/quality adjusted life year (QALY) for all parameters.  3.4. Budget Impact Analysis  To determine the total impact on the healthcare budget due to implementing this new dietary intervention, a budget impact analysis (BIA) was performed that considered the total renal transplant recipients (RTR) population (n = 11,306) in the Netherlands with an annual inflow of 904. Costs were similar for the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and potassium interventions, because the dietary interventions remained the same.",6eb6daf5-3392-4780-924a-13bd9a9aa04e
24,methods24," It was assumed that all current and new renal transplant recipients (RTR) would receive the intervention. The initial costs of implementing this intervention are €5,818,520, after which the annual costs will be €465,234. Over a five-year period, this amounts to a total of €8,144,693.  4. Discussion  The five-year cost of implementing dietary advice (either Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or potassium supplementation) in the Dutch population are likely to stay below 10 million euros. Although the investment is quite extensive, savings might outweigh costs: our results show that adhering to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation increases the total amount of quality adjusted life year (QALY)s compared to the standard of care. Depending on the adherence, the intervention is either cost-saving or cost-effective.",d62b7f2b-49d3-4683-9127-2b51c0d03456
25,methods25," This suggests that from both an economic and healthcare point of view, introducing dietary advice into the Dutch renal transplant recipients (RTR) population could be a useful intervention.  To our knowledge, there are no studies looking at the cost-effectiveness of dietary interventions for renal transplant recipients (RTR). There is a multicenter randomised controlled trial study currently in development, which aims to assess the effectiveness of exercise and diet on physical functioning, cardiometabolic health, and weight gain in renal transplant recipients (RTR) [39]. They will also gather data on cost-effectiveness. To address the patients’ diet, each patient in their intervention group will receive 15 months of dietary counselling with a total of 12 sessions. In our model, dietary counselling only took place in the first year with a total of eight sessions.",188b30d7-2072-42e5-90ae-92fac3e20b18
26,methods26," It is unclear whether increasing the duration and number of visits will improve dietary adherence, and therefore the cost-effectiveness and budget impact, since there is no literature available on this subject. Furthermore, there are a limited number of studies looking at the cost-effectiveness of dietary interventions in reducing disease progression in Chronic kidney disease (CKD). One study found that a very low-protein diet is cost-effective when compared with a moderate low-protein diet [40]. Another study found that multidisciplinary care, which includes visiting a dietician, was cost-effective when compared to the normal situation for most patients with Chronic kidney disease (CKD) [41]. Even though these models are different from the model used in this study, they still address the fact that it is cost-effective to delay dialysis.",b5f2172c-cfcf-458c-9686-ccd2511c9bc8
27,methods27,"  With this cost-effectiveness analysis, we attempted to determine the total costs and effects of dietary interventions for different rates of adherence to group 1. At a baseline adherence of 0% to group 1 (and therefore the highest adherence rates to group 2 and 3), both the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation were dominant; they increased the amount of quality adjusted life year (QALY)s and saved costs. This is in line with our expectations, because patients in groups 2 and 3 are less likely to lose a FG. With more patients keeping a FG, the total amount of quality adjusted life year (QALY)s is higher, and they have lower annual maintenance costs due to a kidney transplant upkeep being lower than the annual dialysis costs.",99b88434-a4c3-4c12-b3b0-76f727425c03
28,methods28," However, in group 2 and group 3, patients are less likely to die with a FG, resulting in more patients staying alive; these patients require maintenance costs for a longer time, and it could be suspected that this could offset the cost saved due to fewer patients needing dialysis. Our results showed that even though more patients in group 2 and group 3 survived for a longer time, these costs were lower than the costs incurred due to dialysis. Another explanation is that patients who survive longer cause more costs in the future, but due to discounting these costs are relatively low. Contrary to this, the highest number of GFs occurs at the beginning of the model where discounting has a smaller effect.  Even though both treatments were dominant at baseline, we found that the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet resulted in more savings, whereas potassium supplementation resulted in more quality adjusted life year (QALY)s.",d32ff158-c7ef-4876-bdd4-dcbbf10a46f6
29,methods29," We had expected that an increase in quality adjusted life year (QALY)s would result in more savings, as can be seen with the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. This discrepancy is caused by differences in the transition probabilities of death with a functioning graft (DWFG) and GF between the diets. If we compare group 3 of both diets, we notice that the probability of GF is similar but that the probability of death with a functioning graft (DWFG) is higher for the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. This results in lower costs for the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and more quality adjusted life year (QALY)s for potassium supplementation, which seems to explain the fact that the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet results in more savings and potassium supplementation in more quality adjusted life year (QALY)s.",05087df4-c010-4266-b22b-9b89f6f22fd8
30,methods30,"  It might be expected that the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation will result in differences in adherence in practice [42,43,44]. An important reason for this could be related to the fact that it puts a financial burden on the patient as the costs for the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation are currently not reimbursed by the Dutch authorities for renal transplant recipients (RTR). This is a commonly seen problem in nutrition economics; the dietary intervention results in a financial burden on the patient whereas the savings mainly occur on the healthcare level. This complicates the interpretation of cost-effectiveness outcomes of dietary interventions. Moreover, although increasing the number of dietician visits from one to eight is expected to increase the adherence, the effect may be disappointing in practice.",d67c638d-a2f0-4d1a-9a1f-9fda6285dd0f
31,methods31," The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet requires a different approach to cooking which might be challenging for an ageing population.  By dividing the group equally based on their adherence rates, we corrected for the fact that some of the patients do not achieve full adherence after the intervention, and therefore do not achieve maximal health effects. This was further explored by varying the percentage of patients that remained in group 1 after the intervention, that is, when fewer patients follow the diets correctly. Due to the aforementioned reasons, this is a more realistic view of how patients will adhere to the dietary intervention, since dietary adherence has been shown to be difficult to achieve and maintain [45].",5645dd8b-669a-4f56-90b3-f2bed9da1621
32,methods32," The analyses showed that if the intervention has a positive effect on more than 10% and 20% of the patients in group 1 for the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation respectively, the intervention would still be cost-saving.  However, this is based on the assumption that the adherence will remain equal over time. Especially the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is not easy to maintain [42]. Moreover, for both the dietary intervention and the potassium supplementation, it was assumed that there was an immediate effect of the intervention, while in reality it could take some time before an effect is achieved. We acknowledge this assumption might not entirely reflect reality and could potentially mitigate the cost-effectiveness results. For future clinical trials or observational cohort studies, it would be interesting to collect data on dietary adherence over time and to model this in a similar way as we did with the survival data.",2c3b19ca-e3a0-43a6-8ac0-e944ed0148e3
33,methods33,"  Next to increasing the number of dietician visits, there are other ways to increase the adherence to diets. Monitoring of food intake has been shown to be a good predictor of dietary adherence, and several types of tools to assist in monitoring have been developed [46,47]. Several studies found that patients using a digital monitoring tool were significantly more likely to adhere to their dietary recommendations [48,49,50]. These methods have proven to be successful, but problems often arise due to uncertainty regarding meal size. Recently, an app (LogMeal) was developed based on deep learning and computer vision, which allows easy and objective monitoring of food intake [24]. The app allows for recognition of food in terms of type of dish, category, and ingredients. The volume of the dish can be estimated, and the micronutrient composition determined.",d864f1cc-202b-4404-a977-0305ea75c67e
34,methods34," Still, due to the novelty of LogMeal and the limited number of studies regarding long-term dietary adherence, it is unclear how well renal transplant recipients (RTR) will adhere to the diet. Our results showed that even with minimal improvements in dietary adherence the treatments remained cost-effective. This can be explained by the relatively low cost of the intervention quickly resulting in a cost-effective treatment.  The probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) showed that the results of our model are robust with 99.7% and 98.8% of simulations being cost-effective for the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation, respectively. It is likely that the intervention will either be dominant to the current situation or cost-effective.",d488cffb-d996-4681-88c6-caa626f76471
35,methods35," The deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) showed that for both the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation interventions, the parameters with the strongest effect were the probabilities of GF and death with a functioning graft (DWFG), especially for group 1. The change in GF and death with a functioning graft (DWFG) probabilities directly affects the number of patients with a FG. Since this is the health state with the highest quality of life and the lowest cost, it is expected that differences in these probabilities will influence the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) the most. Despite these effects, the interventions stayed either dominant or cost-effective for all parameters.  Evaluating the budget impact analysis (BIA), we found that the five-year costs of implementing the intervention were relatively low.",47bf7573-3066-4260-92c2-36149cd3a19d
36,methods36," The main component of the intervention is an increase in visits to the dietician: eight visits of around 30 min each or four hours in total. Dutch health insurance reimburses the first three treatment hours at the dietician for everyone [51]. This would mean that patients would only have to pay for the last two visits themselves, or they can extend their insurance to also cover this.  4.1. Limitations  To determine the costs of dialysis and transplantation, a study from 1998 was used [4]. It is likely that over time costs are going to change; however, the study by De Wit et al. is still the most elaborate published costing study regarding renal replacement therapy. It is still being used in recent studies regarding the cost-effectiveness of dialysis and kidney transplantation [7,23,52]. Moreover, based on the knowledge of a Dutch nephrologist, the costs used in our model are still correct.  To determine the transition probabilities in our model, patient level survival data was used.",6b2b8853-216f-4ac0-bcce-e4023d070c41
37,methods37," The data was extrapolated and several methods were used to calculate the annual transition probabilities for death with a functioning graft (DWFG) and GF [53]. Based on the advice of a nephrologist, at the end of our extrapolation the probability of dying should be higher. This can be addressed by using long-term survival data of renal transplant recipients (RTR) and combining this with the extrapolation data.  In our model, a decision was made against implementing the probability of receiving a pre-emptive re-transplantation. Normally, it is possible that when a patient already has a kidney transplant and this transplant starts failing, instead of first going to dialysis the patient pre-emptively receives a new kidney transplant. However, there is limited data regarding the probability of receiving a pre-emptive re-transplantation. For a normal pre-emptive transplantation in the Netherlands, the probability was 25% in 2017 [38].",dbbb5ed5-ba15-49bd-9fdb-da63a1cb41b9
38,methods38," However, it is reasonable to assume that this probability will drop sharply for the second transplant, with one possible reason being that relatives or friends are not able to donate a second kidney. If more data regarding the probability of a pre-emptive re-transplantation were to become available, it would be of interest to implement this in the model.  The number of events/outcomes in the model can be considered limited, which might affect the costs and outcomes of the model. However, we believe including more events would not have changed the general conclusion of the model, but would have increased both the complexity and uncertainty of the model. Since we focussed on the renal graft, for example cardiovascular events were not included in the model. Nevertheless, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, and potassium supplementation could also potentially reduce these risks as well [54,55].",fb50beb3-4f3c-4b13-a01c-8b5f0e6d06c8
39,methods39," Therefore, the current outcomes of the model are likely a conservative estimate.  As this model uses retrospective data, the cost-effectiveness is mostly theoretical, since there are no trials comparing dietary adherence with an intervention and control arm.  4.2. Future Perspectives  The next step to be taken is to use renal transplant recipients (RTR) long-term survival data to improve the transition probabilities in the model. Doing so will make the model more robust and the results more credible. It is now of interest to look at whether we should focus more on the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or potassium supplementation. The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was dominant in all situations, as opposed to potassium supplementation, making it the preferred option.",8a8deca8-ea01-4434-a5e7-a7aed7fdff2a
40,methods40," However, the adherence between the two diets could strongly differ: the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet requires a change in diet whereas potassium supplementation only requires a pill. This difference could make the adherence of potassium supplementation much higher, thus making it the preferred option. It is also of interest to look at the combined effect of the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation, because these two interventions could theoretically be combined into one dietary recommendation. This most likely would result in even more quality adjusted life year (QALY)s gained and costs saved. It is now necessary to investigate in a patient population how well patients will adhere to dietary interventions and to what degree their health outcomes will improve.",1acbdb04-5743-4ba1-b1eb-09105fdb48a3
41,methods41," This model can be used to justify those head-to-head studies, and it can be used to advocate for renal transplant recipients (RTR) receiving more visits to the dietician.  Moreover, as mentioned before, the long-term adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation is uncertain. Therefore, a head-to-head trial could be used to investigate dietary adherence. Such trial could also possibly be used to support reimbursement of the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and potassium supplementation for renal transplant recipients (RTR), so that the financial burden of the diet does not solely come down to the patient. It would be interesting to do a second cost-effectiveness analysis which could include adherence over time data.  5. Conclusions  To conclude, there is a limited number of available kidneys for transplantation.",9a29e142-c9d5-420e-985c-93929866d6d7
42,methods42," While patients wait for a kidney transplant, they often have no choice but to undergo dialysis to survive; this negatively affects their quality of life and is a burden on the healthcare budget. Once a patient receives a kidney transplant, it is important that it stays functional for as long as possible. We have shown that improvement of the adherence to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and potassium supplementation diets in renal transplant recipients (RTR) is likely to be cost-saving and highly likely to be cost-effective and will improve quality of life by keeping the patients and the kidneys alive for longer. Therefore, the sooner patients improve their diet, the longer they and their kidneys will survive. ",df01d737-26be-4f43-b153-e03aee59dad3
