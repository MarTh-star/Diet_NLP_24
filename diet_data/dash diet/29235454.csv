The study protocol was registered (clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT03542370).  2.2. Study selection The databases Medline and Embase were searched from inception through 3 January 2019 using the search terms “dietary approaches to stop hypertension” or “Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)” and “meta-analysis” (Supplemental Table S1).",dfb91ee2-2ae3-42a5-8a5d-b92bc18625e1

Outomes The primary outcome was incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the prospective cohort studies and SBP in the controlled trials. Secondary outcomes included incident coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)), stroke, and diabetes in the prospective cohort studies and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)), blood lipids (Total-cholesterol (Total-C), LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides), glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)), adiposity (body weight), and inflammation (C-reactive protein) in the controlled trials.  2.6.",813e186a-2f3b-44b6-8cba-a7db0922bc2f
4,methods4," Evidence Synthesis All of the available evidence for each systematic review and meta-analysis identified was summarized, including pooled risk ratios for reports of prospective cohorts and pooled effect estimates of mean differences (MDs) for reports of controlled trials. Where we conducted our own meta-analysis, the generic inverse variance method with fixed or random effects models were used where appropriate [18].   2.7. Grading of the Evidence The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool [19,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34]. This tool allows evidence to be graded as high, moderate, low, or very low quality. Randomized controlled trials start as high-quality evidence and observational studies such as prospective cohort studies start as low-quality evidence. Both can then be downgraded or upgraded on the basis of pre-specified criteria.",cdb3d595-20a9-4640-951f-221f183287b1
5,methods5," The criteria used to downgrade evidence include study limitations (weight of studies showing risk of bias as assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool [22] or the New Castle Ottawa Scale [21], unless otherwise specified), inconsistency (substantial unexplained inter-study heterogeneity, I2 ≥ 50% and P < 0.10), indirectness (presence of factors that limit the generalizability of the results), imprecision (the 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for MDs and risk estimates are wide or cross a minimally important difference), and publication bias (significant evidence of small-study effects). The criteria used to upgrade the quality of evidence are restricted to prospective cohort studies. These criteria include a large magnitude of association (relative risk, (RR) ≤ 0.5 or ≥2), a dose–response gradient, and attenuation by plausible confounding.  3. Results 3.1.

Glycemic Control There were no systematic reviews and meta-analyses identified of trials assessing the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern on HbA1c. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for this outcome.

25,methods25," Discussion The present umbrella review of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern and cardiometabolic outcomes identified three systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies involving 15 unique cohort comparisons in 942,140 participants and 32,927 cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, 7260 coronary heart disease (CHD) events, 4413 stroke events, 23,612 diabetes events, and four systematic reviews and meta-analyses supplemented by one updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and non-randomized controlled trials involving 33 trial comparisons in 4479 participants on intermediate cardiometabolic risk factors. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern was associated with a reduction in the primary outcome of the prospective cohort studies, cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence (20%), as well as reductions in the secondary outcomes: coronary heart disease (CHD) (21%), stroke (19%), and diabetes (18%).",1e71a528-c067-437f-ad1d-586e7043b2fb
26,methods26," These changes were supported by a clinically meaningful reduction in the primary outcome of the controlled trials, blood pressure (−5.2 mmHg for SBP), as well as reductions in the secondary outcomes: diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (−2.6 mmHg), lipids (−0.1 mmol/L for LDL-C and −0.2 mmol/L for Total-C), body weight (1.42 kg), and HbA1c (−0.53%).  4.1. Findings in the Context of the Literature The observed cardiovascular benefits may be attributable to a combination of the foods encouraged as part of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern. High consumption of fruits and vegetables as part of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern have been shown in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies, when consumed either together or alone, to be inversely associated with cardiovascular incidence and mortality [82].",3cb0f3e5-1073-49f5-85ba-734657b1a14a
27,methods27," Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies have also demonstrated that whole grain intake is associated with a 20–21% reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence [83,84] and 14% reduction in stroke incidence [84], dietary pulse intake with a 9% reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence [85], and nut intake with a 21% reduction per 28 g/day [86], while processed and red meats are associated with a 15–18% increase in incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality comparing highest to lowest levels of intake [87,88].",1d07f82d-9094-480c-8b38-06950e24ffaf
28,methods28," A key nutrient richly found in many of the foods emphasized which may contribute a biological effect includes dietary fibre, which has been shown in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) by 9% per 7g/d intake [89] and reduced risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke incidence of 24% and 22%, respectively, when comparing highest to lowest intake groups [84], in addition to significant reductions in body weight, Total-C, LDL-C, and SBP in controlled clinical trials [84]. cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefit may be the result of the biological effects of other key nutrients richly found in foods emphasized in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern, such as magnesium, potassium, and phytochemicals, including flavonoids, which have been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory and anti-antioxidant activity and result in reductions in angiogenesis [56,90,91].",92cb8f58-3642-48c3-8dad-ba186539a41a
29,methods29," The blood pressure lowering effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may play a major role, since high blood pressure is ranked as the strongest risk factor attributable to chronic disease [10,92]. Furthermore, the observed 5.20-mmHg lowering in SBP by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is clinically relevant based on evidence from prospective studies showing that a 2-mmHg reduction in SBP is associated with lower mortality from stroke (10%) and coronary heart disease (CHD) or other vascular causes (7%) in middle-aged men and women [93]. An additional contribution may be via a reduction in established therapeutic lipid targets for cardiovascular risk [11], such as the observed 0.10mmol/L lowering in LDL-C, which would translate to about a 2% reduction in major cardiovascular events based on the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT)) Collaboration [94,95,96]. The observed overall 1.",b1d24a00-87f0-4b11-9802-a27c8d5294f5
30,methods30,"42 kg reduction in body weight may be considered clinically relevant [97] and may also play a role since obesity is a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [98]. Furthermore, a recent prospective cohort not captured in the systematic review and meta-analysis on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern and composite cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes, but which also supports the findings, showed an 11% reduced risk of all-cause mortality when comparing those participants who had the greatest improvement in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet quality score over a 12-year follow-up period compared to those with a relatively stable diet quality [99]. Importantly, they also found a 9% reduced risk among those who maintained a high-quality Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score over the 12-year period compared to those with consistently low diet scores over time [99].",78fcde04-2517-4094-9c3f-146ad2496eea
31,methods31," These results highlight the cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefit of not only adopting or increasing adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern, but also to maintaining a high compliance to it.  The observed reductions in diabetes incidence and improvements in glycemic control again may be attributable to the high consumption of fruit and vegetables as well as the low-fat dairy component of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that fruit and vegetables alone or together [100] and low-fat milk and yogurt [101] are associated with reduced diabetes incidence. Again, dietary fibre coming from many of the foods may play a role since a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies found a 16% reduction in incidence of type 2 diabetes when comparing the highest to lowest fibre intakes84.",cdd0ce14-adba-462d-aec0-aeeb5d786fad
32,methods32," The blood pressure lowering effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may contribute to this effect since hypertension is associated with type 2 diabetes [102], where prospective cohort studies have demonstrated that a 1-mmHg increase in SBP is associated with a 1%–4% increase in type 2 diabetes risk [103,104]. The observed reduction in body weight may also contribute since body weight is strongly associated with diabetes risk [98]. The increase in legumes, nuts, fruit, whole grains and dietary fibre intake, especially from whole grain viscous fibres, as part of a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may also be the mechanism by which there is a reduction in HbA1c, since these have been demonstrated to improve glycemic control in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [105,106,107,108,",20419edd-a0a0-4c2d-946d-911705faf79d
33,methods33,"109] and have been associated with reduced diabetes incidence in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies [110,111].   The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was originally developed to contain foods which increase magnesium, potassium, and calcium based on established links to lower blood pressure and successfully demonstrated a clinically meaningful blood pressure lowering effect [10]. Interactions between these nutrients can also have blood pressure lowering effects, such as the sodium-to-potassium ratio or the interaction between potassium and calcium and the ability to increase sodium excretion by the kidneys [112]. Potassium and calcium have previously been demonstrated to interact with the renin-angiotensin system by affecting plasma renin activity [113,114,115] and potassium can assist with sodium balances and has also been demonstrated to potentially lower blood pressure through endothelium-dependent vascular effects [115,116,117].",f6a582c1-3137-4428-96ba-449a73389e16
34,methods34," Additionally, it has been suggested that a reduction in blood pressure may result from an increased intake of nitrate-rich foods, including fruits and vegetables, especially leafy vegetables, via the role of inorganic nitrate in the non-enzymatic generation of nitric oxide [118]. Furthermore, many of the foods encouraged on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet have demonstrated blood pressure reductions in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of controlled trials in those with and without diabetes, including legumes [119], fruit [120], and whole grains, particularly those rich in viscous fibres [106,121].  The observed reductions in lipids, including the primary lipid target for therapy, LDL-C, may be attributable to the high consumption of fruit, nuts, legumes, and whole grains (especially from oats and barley), increases in dietary fibre, and reductions in saturated fat intake as part of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern.",4562f791-0b15-4046-8aae-05c0a1a713ff
35,methods35," Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have shown that each of these alone [120,122,123,124,125] or combined as part of cholesterol-lowering dietary patterns such as the Portfolio dietary pattern [126] lowers Total-C and LDL-C.  The effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern on body weight may result from increased fruit and vegetable consumption, as was found in a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [127]. Greater dietary fibre intake may contribute to weight loss since high-fibre foods require longer chewing time and promote gastric distention, triggering signals of fullness and slowed digestion, and delayed absorption of nutrients could delay hunger and subsequent energy intake [128]. Increasing dietary pulse intake has also been demonstrated in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of controlled trials to reduce body weight [129] and increase satiety [130].",3b75f146-af84-4ded-b251-b74a89ea0c54
36,methods36," Reduced sodium intake may also play a role in lowering body weight since high sodium intake is associated with obesity in the general population, possibly because of the associated increase in thirst and appetite [131].  Although a significant effect on C reactive protein (CRP) was not observed in the primary pooled analyses, subgroup analyses demonstrated that when the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was compared to an unhealthy or usual diet as opposed to a healthy diet (e.g. Portfolio diet) or when the follow up duration was ≥8 weeks, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet resulted in a significantly lower C reactive protein (CRP). If this is a true effect, then the reduction in inflammation may also play a key role in the observed reduction in incidence of cardiometabolic diseases.",995e9f79-f456-40ae-8dde-3d750d4ce5be
37,methods37," The effect may be mediated by increased dietary fibre intake [132] possibly because of the delay in glucose absorption and alteration to gut microflora which may suppress inflammatory cytokines production, stimulate the production of short-chain fatty acids and lead to lower circulating free fatty acid concentrations and, thus, subsequent inflammation [133,134,135]. The effect may also be the result of increased fruit and vegetable intake due to possible anti-inflammatory effects [136,137] and increased magnesium intake [138,139]. The high content of vitamin C, calcium and magnesium coming from fruits and vegetables in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern may reduce inflammation through reductions in oxidative stress via decreased NADPH oxidase activity [140] and by restoring the activity of anti-oxidative enzymes [141].   4.2.",3cb1303e-62cf-46e1-9de3-be4bc5a45ec1
38,methods38," Strengths and limitations The strengths of the current umbrella review include that the included systematic reviews and meta-analyses were all conducted recently with the census dates of each ranging from January 2012 to November 27, 2018 and an assessment of the overall certainty of the evidence was performed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The limitations include: indirectness for coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence due to the inclusion of cohorts limited to middle-aged and elderly women and for HbA1c due to the inclusion of 2 trials in either type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes; unexplained inconsistency for diabetes incidence (I² = 62%; P = 0.03) and for 8/12 risk factors; imprecision for 9/12 risk factors; and publication bias for triglycerides. Although we did not downgrade the evidence for indirectness, concern may be raised that many of the included trials and cohorts were conducted in people without diabetes.",4d8e67da-a839-486f-a933-cba86757a50d
39,methods39," We did not feel that there was any biological reason to believe that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern would behave differently in people with diabetes, as many components of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern have been shown individually to lower blood pressure and other established cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials inclusive of people with diabetes without any evidence of a subgroup effect by diabetes status [85,108,109,121,122,129,142,143].",0b06e2aa-5f70-4f0b-8440-91ad9e59cd37
40,methods40,"We also felt that this concern was mitigated by the evidence of similar or greater improvements in all of the measured outcomes (SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), LDL-C, Total-C, HDL-C, TG, HbA1c, body weight, C reactive protein (CRP)) in those trials conducted exclusively in diabetes (that is, the effect estimates for these outcomes in the individual trials were contained within or exceeded the 95% confidence intervals of the overall pooled estimates).   Weighing the strengths and limitations, the certainty of the evidence based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was rated as very low to low for associations with cardiometabolic disease incidence and low to moderate for effects on cardiometabolic risk factors.  4.3. Implications Clinical practice guidelines recommend dietary strategies as the cornerstone of the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [4,5,6,7,8,9].",494da3c8-e38b-4b58-9382-45135af28bfe
41,methods41," Our pooled analyses demonstrate that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is associated with a 20% reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and has blood pressure benefits which may translate to about a 20% reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), along with meaningful benefits in other established cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in those with and without diabetes. In the systematic review and meta-analysis on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern and blood pressure, trials included participants who were hypertensive but not on medication [10,49,53,56,58,59,60], as well as trials where participants were taking blood pressure medications [51,54], all of which found significant blood pressure lowering effects. Thus, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern may play a role both as a first line therapy as well as an add-on therapy.",82795d3c-f8b3-48a0-b728-ca6f64a54c08
42,methods42,"  There may be an important opportunity for people with and without diabetes to realize the cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefits of a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern emphasizes fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy, whole grains, nuts and legumes, and limits total and saturated fat. Specifically, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet includes 4–5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day, 2–3 servings of low fat dairy, 6–8 servings of whole grains and limits meat, poultry and fish to less than six servings per day. It also recommends 4–5 servings per week of nuts, seeds, dry beans, and peas and choosing foods with low saturated fat, high potassium and fibre, and low sodium. Dietary intake patterns in Europe and other Western countries do not currently meet these targets.",37f62153-4aa7-43d3-b0ad-429f7a9ecc1a
43,methods43," The European Health Interview Survey (European Health Interview Survey (EHIS)) (Eurostat 2016) reports that, on average, more than a third of the EU adults do not consume any fruits and vegetables on a daily basis and only 14.1% consume five portions per day [144]; about one third of those aged 35 and older had average intakes of saturated fat ≥15 E% [145]; although a high total consumption of dairy products was reported in the Dutch, Swedish and Danish, and most of Spain and the UK, a somewhat low consumption was reported Greece and in some of Italy (Ragusa and Turin) [146]. According to the most recent survey in the United States, only one in 10 adults and youths eat the recommended amount of fruits or vegetables [147], only 1.9 servings/day of dairy products are consumed on average [148], only ~38.2% of adults consume nuts on a given day [149] and most exceed the recommendations for added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium [14].",cf7a57c9-a1b0-489a-b338-f279b1cb19bb
44,methods44," These data suggest that in these populations that there is an opportunity for people with and without diabetes to increase these foods to achieve a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern and realize the cardiometabolic benefits.  5. Conclusions In conclusion, this synthesis of systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrates that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern as a well-accepted blood pressure-lowering diet has associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefit supported by reductions in blood pressure, HbA1c, LDL-C and other established cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in people with and without diabetes. The certainty of the evidence based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was very low to low for associations with cardiometabolic disease incidence and low to moderate for effects on cardiometabolic risk factors.",06986c44-cca7-4540-a2b8-e1185334c618
45,methods45," More research is needed to improve the estimates and confirm that these benefits do translate into reductions in clinical outcomes of clinical practice and public health importance. In this regard, there remains a need for large randomized trials of the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern on clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes in those with and without diabetes. The available evidence does support a potential opportunity for those with and without diabetes to adopt the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern to improve cardiometabolic health.
