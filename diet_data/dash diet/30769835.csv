0,introduction0,"Chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular diseases (CVD)), diabetes, cancers, and chronic respiratory diseases, are the most important causes of mortality in different communities [1]. Adherence to healthy dietary patterns is an indispensable part of clinical guidelines to prevent and control non-communicable diseases (NCDs) [2]. Dietary patterns are preferred to individual nutrients, food items, or food groups [3]; because it is proposed that dietary patterns provide a more comprehensive insight into relationships between diet and disease [4]. Furthermore, dietary patterns might be more predictive of chronic disease compared to individual foods or nutrients, because they account for possible interactions between dietary foods/nutrients in the diet [5].  In the last two decades, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)) has emerged as a healthy eating guideline [6, 7].",49ab8ad7-bfed-44c1-ad5a-a4af1fc247fd
1,introduction1," The diet consists of a set of recommendations including increased consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and nuts and reduced consumption of sweets, sodium, and red and processed meats [6, 7]. The key components of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet have been related to mortality, by previous investigations; as an inverse association was represented between the intake of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and nuts with the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), total cancers, and mortality from all causes [8–11]; furthermore, a greater risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality following the high consumption of red and processed meats, trans fats, simple sugars, and sodium is suggested by previous studies [12–15]. It is mentioned that the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet might be a stronger predictor of disease risk compared to its components [6, 7].",0f82aa8a-0cec-445e-9c58-ea72be5254ee
2,introduction2,"  The previous systematic reviews have shown that the better compliance with the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern could reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)) [16, 17], body weight and fat [18]; and also improve glycemic control [19], and serum inflammatory markers [20]; thus, it might significantly protect against cardiovascular diseases (CVD), stroke, diabetes, and cancers, which are associated with a lower life expectancy rate [21]. Prospective studies on the association between the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and the mortality rate have shown some incompatible findings [22–25]. This might be because of different approaches that have been used to define the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet index; as the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score developed by Dixon et al. [26], Günther et al. [27], and Fung et al.",59266065-22ff-4187-9aa4-90ab385ff401
3,introduction3," [28] mainly focused on dietary food groups whereas the index provided by Mellen et al. [29] was a nutrient-based dietary pattern.  Although previous meta-analyses of prospective observational studies exhibited an inverse association between adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and risk of health outcomes [30, 31], they only performed a high vs. low imitation meta-analysis, and the shape of the dose-response relationship was not determined. By determining the shape of the dose-response relationship, we will be able to show how the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality changes along with the greater adherence to the diet.",3f34f7a7-4090-4180-94bc-3cd5342a2701
4,introduction4," Therefore, the present study aimed to test the linear and non-linear dose-response association between adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD)-, stroke-, cancer-, and all-cause mortality in the general population, by conducting a systematic review and dose-response meta-anallysis of prospective observational studies, for the first time.

8,methods3," For dose-response analyses, a quantitative measure of adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet for at least three quantitative categories and the total number of cases and participants/person-years or non-cases had to be available in the publication or on request from the authors. Studies that reported a linear association between the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet adherence score and mortality risk were also included.  Data extraction Data extraction was conducted using a predefined form. The following information was extracted by two independent investigators (SS, AJ): the first author’s last name, publication year, study location, sample size, number of cases, duration of follow-up, ascertainment of outcomes, the components of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, participants’ sex and age, and variables adjusted for in the multivariate analyses.",c8c3aa48-62c2-47b5-8fda-c2b75c1ec6b5

10,methods5," Three main domains including “selection”, “comparability”, and “outcome” are considered to assess the quality in this scale. In the “selection” domain, four items are checked (representativeness of the exposed cohort, selection of the non-exposed cohort, ascertainment of exposure, and demonstration that the outcomes were not present at the start of the study). In the “comparability” domain, the control of confounders in the design or analysis of the studies is considered. The “outcome” domain, considers the outcomes ascertainment, duration of follow-up and adequacy of follow-up of cohorts. The overall quality of included studies was considered as good if they received 3–4 stars in the “selection: domain, 1-2 stars in the “comparability” domain, and 2–3 stars in the “outcome” domain.",f37574fb-4c15-40bb-bbdf-735e84b83a0a

Methods used to assess the adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet Four dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet scoring methods are used in the majority of cohort studies: 1) The traditional dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet scoring that was first specified by Fung et al. [28] which considers 8 components (fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, sodium, red and processed meats, and sweetened beverages). The scoring system is based on quintiles with the lowest intake receiving one point and the top quintile receiving 5 points for healthy components.",911ba27f-8b87-47e1-8530-6748432398a3
12,methods7," The scoring for unhealthy components is reversely coded so that quintile 1 receives 5 points and quintile 5 receives one point. The overall score ranges from 8 (the lowest adherence) to 40 (the highest adherence) [28]; 2) The modified dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score which includes 7 components: fruits; vegetables; dairy; meat, poultry, fish, and eggs; nuts, seeds, and legumes; fats and oils; and sodium, which the maximum point for each component is 10 and the possible score ranges between 0 to 70 points [34]; 3) The Mellen index, a nutrient-based index with 9 components including saturated fat, total fat, proteins, cholesterol, fiber, magnesium, calcium, potassium, sodium, that each component received 1 point; and the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score ranges from 0 to 9 [29]; 4) The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)-like eating plan which includes eight dietary components: whole grains, fruits and vegetables, nuts/seeds and legumes,",10a66dcf-63e8-41ce-b4d8-8039b971e904
13,methods8," fish, sodium, added sugar, processed meat, and energy percentage from saturated fat. In this method the healthy intakes are assigned a score of “1,” otherwise they are scored as “0.” Points are summed across eight dietary components, leading to a total score which ranges from 0 to 8 [36].

The study done by Aigner et al. [44], did not consider the lowest category of adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet as the reference category, thus we recalculated the relative risks by using the method suggested by Hamling et al.

For the linear dose-response meta-analysis, assuming a linear relationship between adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and risk of all-cause and specific mortality, the HRs for each 5-point increment in adherence to the traditional dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet score (ranging from 8 to 40) were pooled using a random-effects model.",01c0fe14-d47c-42a3-9e3d-d9aab5410783
26,analysis1," To explore the potential non-linear relationship between adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality, the non-linear dose-response meta-analysis was performed based on the two-stage hierarchical regression model in which the difference between category-specific and reference-specific doses, expressed in quadratic terms, was calculated [49]. The spline transformation was used to estimate the within- and between-study variances [49]. All analyses were conducted using a random-effects model which takes the between-study variability into account.  The sensitivity analysis was performed to test the potential effect of each study or each dietary assessment method on pooled effect sizes. The Cochran’s Q test and I-squared (I2) statistic were used to evaluate the heterogeneity between studies [50].",9715a1d6-cd93-408f-82bd-2b65846c598b

Publication bias was evaluated using Egger’s test (weighted linear regression test) and Begg’s test (rank correlation test) [51]. All analyses were conducted using Stata version 13.0. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  The overall quality of the meta-evidence The quality of the present study was assessed by using the NutriGrade scoring system [52], which considers the risk of bias, study quality and limitations, heterogeneity, precision, directness, funding bias, publication bias, study design, effect size, and dose-response.

Twenty articles were potentially relevant to be included in the systematic review. After reading their full-texts, nine articles were excluded for the following reasons: conducted on patients (n = 6) [patients with heart failure (n = 1), patients with history of colorectal (n = 2) and breast cancer (n = 1), and patients with hypertension (n = 2)] [25, 53–57]; sudden cardiac death was the outcome of interest (n = 1), [24], reported duplicate data [58] (n = 1), and not providing the sufficient data (n = 1) [59].

29,results1," Of the 13 related publications, one publication reported the results in two different cohort studies and therefore, was considered as two separate studies [34]. Finally, 17 prospective cohort studies (13 publications) were included in the final analyses [22, 23, 33, 34, 36–44]. Three studies (two publications) did not provide sufficient data regarding the number of deaths and risk of mortality based on each category (quartile or quintile) of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet score; thus, they were not included in the non-linear dose-response meta-analysis [34, 40].

All included studies used a validated food frequency questionnaire to assess dietary intakes except two studies that evaluated dietary intakes using 3-day dietary records [36]. All studies provided adjusted risk estimates and all of HRs were adjusted for age, smoking, energy intake and physical activity and the majority of them adjusted the associations for alcohol consumption (15 studies) [22, 23, 34, 36–39, 41–44] and BMI (16 studies) [22, 23, 33, 34, 37, 38, 40–44].

All studies except two [36, 41] (which acquired 8 stars because mortality and its causes were not confirmed by a satisfactory record) received the highest possible score.  Adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and all-cause mortality The relationship between adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and the risk of all-cause mortality was evaluated in thirteen cohort studies (9 Publications, comprising 1,240,308 participants) (Fig. 2a) [23, 33, 34, 36, 38–43]. The linear dose-response analysis showed that each 5-point increase in the adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet is associated with 5% lower all-cause mortality (HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.94–0.96), and the heterogeneity was assessed to be high (I2 = 91.6%, Pheterogeneity < 0.001).",d85731b1-4dad-467b-9385-a3b12f5cce4c
32,results4," In the sensitivity analysis, results showed that exclusion of any single comparison does not significantly alter the pooled HR (HRs ranged between 0.95 to 0.96). To further confirm the robustness of the findings, a series of sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding the studies that used different methods to define adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH). The similar results were obtained when we removed data addressed the Ideal Diet Index [36], Mellen index [41] and Bethesda-7 component scoring system [34]. The inverse association between adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and all-cause mortality were similar across sex, study location, study follow-up, and study participant’s characteristics. The association was more pronounced in studies with less than 13 years of follow-up and those with sample sizes greater than 100,000 participants, male population and those conducted in European countries (Supplementary Table 1).",23c6fb7a-3755-4350-977c-dc88751cd379
33,results5," There was a slight indication of publication bias when it was checked by the use of Egger’s test, P = 0.02, however, it was not confirmed by Begg’s test, P = 0.14 (Supplementary Fig. 1A). From the eleven prospective cohort studies, ten reported the data needed for the nonlinear dose-response relationship analysis [23, 33, 36, 38, 39, 41–43]. A non-linear association was seen (P nonlinearity = 0.001) with steeper inverse associations at greater adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet [Fig. 3(a)].

Similar results were obtained when we removed studies that used the Ideal Diet Index [36], the Mellen index [41] and the Folsom scoring system [41] to assess the adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet. The significant inverse association persisted across all subgroups and the association had more strength in studies with less than 13 years of follow-up and those with sample sizes greater than 100,000 participants and conducted in European populations (Supplementary Table 2). There was no indication of publication bias using Egger’s test (P = 0.149) or Begg’s test (P = 0.451) (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Ten studies had data for the non-linear dose-response analysis [22, 23, 36–39, 41, 43]. There was evidence of non-linearity (P nonlinearity = 0.006) with greater reducing associations at the highest scores of the adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet (Fig. 3b).",86595d1d-8a83-421b-89ab-d21d8d2100e0
36,results8,"  Adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and stroke mortality The relationship between adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and the risk of stroke mortality was evaluated in two cohorts (193,036 participants) [37, 44]. The pooled hazard risk estimation was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96–0.98) for each 5-point in the adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, without evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 0.00%, P heterogeneity = 0.563).

Similar results were obtained when we removed studies that used the Ideal Diet Index [36] or the Mellen index scoring system [41] from the meta-analysis. In the subgroup analysis, the study participants and the follow-up duration were found to be the possible sources of heterogeneity (Supplementary Table 3). The significant inverse association was more pronounced in studies with less than 13 years of follow-up, studies with sample sizes greater than 100,000 participants, and those conducted in the European populations (Supplementary Table 3).

There was evidence of nonlinearity (P nonlinearity < 0.001) with steeper inverse associations at the greater adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet [Fig. 3c].  Overall quality of the meta-evidence We rated the quality of meta-evidence for the four interested outcomes. The NutriGrade meta-evidence grading was rated as “high” for all-cause, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and cancer mortality (Supplementary Table 4). ",f97bca93-3b8e-420c-a567-8040a2b1293e
39,discussion0,"The present systematic review and meta-analysis showed that adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet had a significant inverse dose-response association with all-cause, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), stroke, and cancer mortality. The Linear dose-response meta-analysis revealed that each 5-point increment in the adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet could significantly lower the risk of all-causes, cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer mortality by 5% (6–4%), 4% (5–2%), 3% (4–2%), and 3% (5–2%), respectively. The present results might be of clinical importance because every 5-point greater adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet might prevent at least 4, 2, 2, and 2 out of every 100 all-cause, cardiovascular diseases (CVD)-cause, and cancer-cause deaths, respectively.",98bdd34f-804f-4928-aa31-725841f427e5
40,discussion1," The non-linear dose-response analysis not only showed lower mortality rates with greater adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet; but also revealed that the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)-mortality association becomes steeper when the adherence score exceeds from 20 points (medium to high adherence).  The current study provided supportive findings that are in-line with previous meta-analyses [30, 31, 60], which found a significant inverse association between dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet adherence and all-cause, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer mortality. The strengths of the current meta-analysis include the comprehensive and up to date literature searches. Also, since our analyses were performed on prospective studies, we effectively avoided recall bias and selection bias.",c3ef8785-a6c3-4668-98de-fcfc6676bb7f
41,discussion2," Moreover, compared to the recent meta-analyses, the relationship between the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and all-cause, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), stroke, and cancer mortality were separately analyzed in a dose-response manner, for the first time.  The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet is high in some of bioactive compounds (e.g., fiber, minerals, trace elements, vitamins, and phytochemicals) found in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables that have antioxidant, anti-atherogenic, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and anti-tumor properties. These compounds are inversely associated with the risk of cancers, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and other chronic diseases [61, 62]. On the other hand, the diet is low in harmful compounds found in processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, and salt, which are associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, hypertension, insulin resistance, and carcinogenesis [61].",7503e6c0-ccbb-4319-9d29-020287547525
42,discussion3," The previous investigations have also provided evidence about the beneficial effects of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet on insulin resistance [19], hypertension [16], hyperlipidemia [53], inflammation [20], and oxidative stress [53], which are shown to be associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), stroke, and cancers.  There are a number of limitations that should be noted when interpreting our results. Although statistically significant lower mortality was observed with greater adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, a considerable heterogeneity was observed between the studies. Several subgroup analyses were performed based on gender, study duration, age, geographical location, etc.; however, none of the variables could completely explain the heterogeneity found between study results. It was shown that the effect might be different based on the geographical location of the study.",3a38e237-93c3-4038-8045-0dd9a788ffb7
43,discussion4," The HRs were higher in the USA compared to Asia and Europe. It is proposed that the American people are different from Asian and European people with respect to lifestyle, dietary habits, and genetic background [48, 63]. The difference between dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet scoring methods at least in part might also explain the heterogeneity between studies. The differences in food groups considered for scoring might affect the ability of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) scoring methods to predict the mortality risk. For instance, only two included studies accounted for saturated fat as a component for calculating the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score [36, 37]; however, the other studies indirectly considered saturated fat by including components like animal foods in the scoring method.",44945c5d-e60c-4b6a-bdf5-653e2bd60ccc
44,discussion5," Although the studies were different in the dietary adherence assessment method, the sensitivity analysis revealed that the overall estimates did not depend on a specific method. The other source of heterogeneity between study results might be the difference in the definition of the common dietary food groups (the food groups included in different scoring methods are the same; however, the food items included to define the food groups might be different). We were not able to check this point because the majority of the included studies did not provide data about the food items included to define each food group. It should be noted that the studies included in the meta-analysis controlled the associations for the majority of potential confounders, including age, energy intake, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, and body mass index; however, due to their observational nature, the results may be influenced by other uncontrolled confounding variables.",0c3d5415-15ec-411f-93af-a778bef3423c
45,discussion6," Although cohort studies are less likely to be affected by recall bias, the majority of included studies used food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) to measure the participants’ dietary intakes and this tool is prone to measurement error due to misclassification. On the other hand, because the dietary assessment was performed at baseline, the dietary changes over time might also affect the observed relationship. Furthermore, only two studies in the analysis of all-cause mortality were from Asia, and all studies which provided data on cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer mortality were from western countries (mainly from the US). Therefore, more studies in other societies with different dietary habits, environmental factors, and genetic susceptibilities are needed to confirm the current results.",5dd402d3-a226-4009-985b-beafb9288254
46,discussion7,"  Conclusion In conclusion, the present systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies provided evidence regarding the dose-response association between adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cancers, stroke, and all-causes. A greater protective association was observed among those withmedium to high adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, compared to those reporting a low adherence. Future cohort studies from different regions are recommended to replicate the current findings.
