Dietary assessment  The semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was administered to assess the dietary foods and supplements. The original semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) contains 168 items, but 10 more questions were added on consumption of Yazd-specific frequently consumed food items, which made a total of 178 food items (included: breads and grains (n = 23); beans (n = 7); meats, fish, and shellfish (n = 19); milks and dairy products (n = 17); vegetables (n = 26); fruits (n = 40); fats and nuts (n = 13); beverages (n = 5); and snacks and sweets (n = 28).",0c967fd9-3ccd-480b-84ee-2d30c2d2015c
4,methods3," The semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was previously validated for the Iranian population [16, 17], so the questionnaire was completed by trained interviewers. Participants were supposed to report the amount and frequency of consuming each food item per month, week, or day in the past year. Moreover, a food photograph book was used for all participants as a reference, so that they could estimate the portion size of foods as a unit accurately. Participants were also asked to report their intake frequency with regard to all food items based on 10 multiple-choice frequency response categories ranging from “never or less than once a month” to “10 or more times per day.” Later, the amount of food consumed at each intake was estimated using questions with five predefined answers. Frequency and usual amount of food items consumption were asked by participants and finally, amounts of intakes were converted to grams using guidelines of household scales [18].",8f5d3fd9-4c68-460b-b531-d537e054dd83
5,methods4,"  Calculate of the MIND diet score  In order to calculate the MIND diet score, food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) questionnaire data were used. The MIND diet model was determined based on Morris’s study [13]. The components of MIND include 15 food items, 10 of which are known as healthy groups for the brain (green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil, and wine) and 5 of which are known as unhealthy food groups for the brain (red meats, butter and stick margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets, and fried/fast food). Each of these dietary components was obtained based on the total intake of the population for each item of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). However, because 100% of the participants in the study reported being Muslim and not consuming wine, wine consumption was not included in the calculation of this dietary pattern.",016f770c-ebc7-4a6f-8c08-3374a65896e9
6,methods5," To calculate the score of this food pattern, first the participants in the study were classified based on tertile categories of food intake of 14 components of this diet pattern and then for healthy food components for the brain, the highest to lowest tertile of receiving these food items, scores 1, 2 and 3 were considered (respectively) and for unhealthy components, these scores were reversed and the lowest to highest tertile of receiving these food items, scores 1, 2 and 3 were considered, respectively. Finally, the higher the MIND score, the greater the adherence to this diet. The score range of this index is varied from 14 to 42. Then, by summarizing all these food items, the overall score of the MIND diet was obtained.  Psychological health assessment (depression ‚anxiety and stress)  An Iranian version of the pre-completed DASS 21 questionnaire was used to assess psychological stress, depression, and anxiety [19].",263a3910-2e72-4e7d-98b7-337b3ee5704d
7,methods6," The validity of DASS was measured using factor analysis and criterion validity (concurrent method). The correlation between the depression subscale and the beck depression inventory scale was + 0.70, between the anxiety subscale and Zung anxiety inventory was + 0.67, and between the stress subscale and perceived stress inventory was + 0.49. All correlations were significant. Males and females scores were significantly different on all subscales, therefore, separate norms for each gender were presented. This questionnaire consists of 3 subscales (stress ‚anxiety and depression) and 21 questions. Each of the subscales contains 7 questions, the final score of each of which was obtained through the sum of the scores of the related questions. Each question was scored from 0 (does not apply to me at all) to 3 (does not apply to me at all).",3b0a44d6-d03f-490c-b551-419c924df979
8,methods7," Since DASS 21 is the short form of the DASS questionnaire (42 items), the accumulated scores for each subscale are multiplied by 2, and finally depression, anxiety, and stress were defined based on the scores obtained: depression: Score ≥ 10‚ anxiety: ≥ 8 points, and stress: ≥ 15 points.  Anthropometric and physical activity assessment  The weight of the participants was measured using portable and digital scales (Omron BF511 inc.

17,results1,"  Keywords  Mental Disorders Depression Anxiety Mediterranean Diet dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2022 ==== Body pmcIntroduction  Psychological disorders and stress have caused great concern and burden among people, especially adult [1]. Depression and anxiety are among the most important psychological disorders and have been one of the causes of disability in the last 25 years [2]. Prevalence of mild, moderate, intense, and highly intense anxiety in Iran was 31, 37, 19, and 2, respectively [3]. In addition, the prevalence of depression was 44, the prevalence of stress was 40, the prevalence of overt anxiety was 21, and prevalence of covert anxiety was 24 [3]. However, conventional treatments have not been sufficient to prevent the spread of these patients [4].",2a67b4ea-a8da-4d67-ade8-430880fc4f6e
18,results2,"  In the last few decades, the effects of various factors, especially diet and the intake of certain nutrients on the nervous system and psychological disorders and stress have been considered [5]. So that, a higher intake of antioxidant micronutrients and some food groups such as fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products and lower intake of sugar-sweetened drinks and high-fat dairy products have been associated with a reduction in the risk of psychological [4, 5]. However, given that most of the nutrients and special food in the diet are usually consumed together and may have synergistic effects on each other, the examining of dietary patterns that reflect all the characteristics of the diet is more appropriate and accurate [6].  Evidence has shown that an unhealthy and western diet increases the risk of mental disorders and stress [7].",28c36454-484d-42ac-9f7a-4c92c4e42d2f
19,results3," Also, in previous studies, the relationship between Mediterranean and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diets on psychological disorders and stress has been investigated, however, the results have been contradictory. In some studies, the beneficial effects of these diets on these patients were shown [8–10], but in other studies, there was insufficient evidence in this regard [11, 12]. In this context, a neuroprotective diet pattern has recently been described as the MIND (Mediterranean- dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet, which is a combination of Mediterranean and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diets [4].  This diet pattern seems to play an important role in life stress and psychological health by emphasizing plant-based foods and limiting animal foods and saturated fats [13].",0a3a7db0-ae98-4697-8b88-2dd2ddef45b4
20,results4," This diet pattern is also rich in antioxidant nutrients that reduce oxidative stress and inflammation as one of the important factors involved in neurodegenerative disease [14]. One study found that consumption MIND diet reduced the risk of Alzheimer’s disease [13]. Also in one study, adherence to the MIND diet further reduced cognitive impairment compared to the Mediterranean and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diets [15]. However, in one study, no association was found between MIND diet and depression [4].  Tus, regarding the important role of dietary intake in the prevention and management of psychiatric disorders as well as stress and little evidence linking MIND and these problems, the current cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the relationship between MIND score with depression, anxiety and psychological stress among a large representative sample of Iranian adult population.

21,discussion0," In the present study, we investigated the relationship between adherence to MIND diet and the odds of developing psychological stress and psychological disorders among Iranian adults. The results of our study showed that after adjusting the possible confounders, the odds of depression and anxiety significantly decreased with increasing adherence to the MIND diet, however, no significant relationship was observed between dietary pattern and odds of psychological stress.  Recently, a cross-sectional study conducted by Salari Moghadam et al.",a86064f6-8469-44b2-88e2-fbdd5ebd9fde
22,discussion1," [21] in 2019 on 3176 Iranian adults to investigate the relationship between this dietary pattern and the odds of psychological disorders and stress, showed that although the likelihood of depression and psychological stress decreases with increasing adherence to this diet, but contrary to our study, no significant effect was observed between anxiety and this dietary pattern that this difference in results could be due to differences in food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and psychological health assessment questionnaire used as well as differences in the score of these mental disorders.  In addition, contrary to our findings, a prospective study by Farsan et al. in 2018 reported no significant association between adherence to the MIND diet and the risk of depression. However, the components they used to build the MIND diet were slightly different from ours [4].",24de7096-096c-4fea-ba55-360d11618321
23,discussion2," Previous studies, however, have shown an inverse relationship between foods rich in fruits and vegetables, legumes, and olives as components of the MIND diet with depression and anxiety [22, 23].  Some other studies have examined the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diets as two components of the MIND diet. For example, in a study aimed at investigating the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the prevalence of psychological disorders and stress among a large population of Iranian adults, the findings of this study showed that after controlling potential confounders, participants who followed the Mediterranean diet the most were less likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and stress [24]. They also reported that high consumption of fruits and vegetables was associated with a lower risk of depression, anxiety, and psychological stress.",89f6e2e1-e56c-4264-8d57-9f7d49718384
24,discussion3," In contrast, high cereal intake was positively associated with depression, anxiety, and psychological stress.  A cross-sectional analysis of 1183 data from 40- to 65-year-old Australian adults examined the association between cognitive impairment, memory, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, general health, and physical function following the Mediterranean diet [25]. The majority of Australians (71.7%) had a moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern and generally did not associate adherence to the Mediterranean diet with cognitive function. However, diet-related plant foods were negatively correlated with physical function and general health, and with perceived trait anxiety, depression, and stress. The important point in this study is that a significant portion of the diet in this Australian sample is of foods that are not normally part of the Mediterranean diet.",88a519c9-e329-4690-8833-415c6ae47e30
25,discussion4,"  In another cross-sectional study of 181 girls between the ages of 18 and 25, the results showed that those with the highest levels of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) adherence (highest adherence) had significantly lower scores on psychological stress and increased cognitive function [26].  Another article in line with our findings, aimed at examining the relationship between dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and psychological health among 3846 Iranian adults, reported that moderate adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with a lower likelihood of depression compared to those with the lowest adherence [12]. In addition, after controlling for potential confounders, an inverse relationship was observed between high dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet adherence and anxiety in participants.",0b800672-3aa0-480b-86a6-32166bebd501
26,discussion5," However, no significant relationship was reported between dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intake and psychological stress.  In general, differences in findings between our study and other studies may be related to differences in sample size, characteristics, and health status of participants, as well as tools for assessing food intake and mental health, as well as calculating MIND diet scores.  The mechanisms by which the MIND diet may affect brain health are not yet fully understood by studies and scientists. However, given that inflammation and oxidative stress are important contributors to neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders, it seems that the MIND diet may be through rich sources of vitamins, minerals, flavonoids and antioxidants [14, 27]. It has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and thus protects the brain [27].",5bdd9c48-7fab-49fa-be5c-6d592fdc7fc4
27,discussion6," Berries and green leafy vegetables are two special components of this diet that berries have been proven to improve motor function (coordination and balance) in mice and increase speed and reduce walking error in humans [14]. This diet is also rich in carotenoids and vitamin E has been shown to be associated with a reduced risk of developing Parkinson’s and improved physical function in adults [14]. In addition, the MIND diet contains limited amounts of unhealthy foods including red meat and products, butter, fast foods and sweets that may be harmful to brain health by increasing inflammation and oxidative stress [13].  Among the strengths of the present study include: having a sufficient and large sample size, as well as controlling potential disruptive factors, using a validated 178-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) by a face-to-face interview and also using nutritionists to complete the questionnaires.",1bd8f139-9901-4cba-88a7-bf8263e9f3b1
28,discussion7," However, due to the cross-sectional design of this study, the inference of causal relationships between this dietary pattern and mental disorders is affected. For example, poor diet may expose people to depression and mental stress. On the other hand, people who are depressed may consume large amounts of sweets and sugary foods to reduce depressive symptoms. Therefore, prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings. While to confirm these results, observational studies must be repeated in several parts of the world. However, it should be borne in mind that proper cross-sectional data analysis is a valuable first step in identifying the relationship between diet and disease. In addition, prospective cohort studies and clinical trials have their own weaknesses. Questionnaire-based data were also used to assess psychological disorders in this study.",52bb7197-5b63-4a4b-9087-d7a5c14e1b7d
29,discussion8," Although we used a valid Iranian version of the questionnaires, the possibility of incorrectly classifying participants in terms of results is also inevitable. In addition, we had no information about wine in our food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Therefore, we removed this component in the construction of the MIND diet.  Conclusion  Finally, our study showed that increasing adherence to the MIND diet may reduce the odds of depression and anxiety by increasing healthy foods with high levels of antioxidants. Therefore, by recommending this diet, you can prevent the possibility of these psychological problems. However, there is a need to design studies with stronger methodologies such as clinical trial studies.  Acknowledgements  Yazd people who participated in YaHS and TAMYZ studies.
