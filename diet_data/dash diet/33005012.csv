0,analysis0," SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, 113 USA) was used to conduct Statistical analyses. Data were analyzed for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and are showed as means ± SD (for normally distributed data) or median and interquartile range (for non-normally distributed data). The differences between participants across the quartiles of energy-adjusted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score were compared using analysis of variance (adjusted DASH score were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA)) or Kruskal-Wallis test (Kruskal-Wallis test used for non-normally distributed data) and the chi-square tests for quantitative variables and qualitative variables, respectively. Dietary Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was categorized into 4 quartiles based on the distribution among controls.",884d0fcb-1efa-4cd0-a2ed-92a0e822d354
1,analysis1," Binary logistic regression was applied to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for quartiles of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. BMI (kg/m2), age (year), alcohol consumption, physical activity (MET), and history of diabetes, Coronary heart disease (Coronary heart disease (CHD)) and hypertension, family history of cancer were considered as potential confounders and were included in the models. The p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant and all reported p-values are two-tailed. ",c0109215-90b6-4ad2-9e11-b76ec51221c4

There was no statistically significant difference among participants (cancers and controls, adenomas and controls) in relation to BMI, family history of colorectal cancer in first-degree relatives, smoking status, vitamin D supplement, multivitamin use and energy intake. However, family history of cancer in first-degree relatives of Colorectal cancer (CRC) cases was higher than controls (51.2% versus 32.9%; p-value< 0.01). Compared to controls, having at least one comorbidity such as diabetes was seen more in adenoma cases (36.9% versus 15.8%; p-value< 0.01) and the calcium supplement consumption was higher in adenoma cases than controls (24.6% versus 14.6; p-value = 0.01). Besides, the median value for physical activity was significantly higher in controls than adenomas [39.02 (36.51–41.33) vs. 37.75(34.67–40.40); p-value< 0.01].",8ca73d1e-9b21-4c4e-9e9d-cd881321b982

6,results9," After adjusting for confounding variables, including BMI (kg/m2), age (year), alcohol consumption, physical activity (MET), history of diabetes, Coronary heart disease (CHD) and hypertension and family history of cancer, adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with a reduction in the risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRA, respectively (OR = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01–0.11, OR = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.04–0.22). Also, subgroup analysis based on gender showed that both women and men with higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores had significantly lower risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRAs.",b743b734-60d9-4458-bf17-618917d818eb
7,discussion0," In this case-control study of Iranian men and women, we observed that a higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was associated with a reduced risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRAs in Iranian adults. In addition, this association was seen in subgroup analysis based on gender, where a higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was related to lower risk of both Colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRA in men and women.  The findings of our study are in line with some other studies that displayed an inverse relationship between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and the risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) [22, 31] and CRAs [24, 25]. Indeed, considering studies that performed sex-specific analysis, four studies showed a significant inverse association between higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk only in men [31–33] and one study only in women [34].",89fa7e16-396e-4f87-bb7c-4a0dca6545a1
8,discussion1," However, another study reported this relationship was present only in women, where the authors noted a reduced risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) in higher quartiles of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score [35]. Indeed, disparities between studies could be due to the following reasons: differences in etiology of Colorectal cancer (CRC) and responses to diet in men and women, hormone replacement therapy (hormone replacement therapy (HRT)) and oral contraceptive (oral contraceptive (OCP)) consumption in women which are independently and inversely associated to Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk [33, 36] and considering colon and rectum cancer separately or as a single cancer in analyses. Our study agrees with the result of a newly published systematic review and meta-analysis which reported an inverse significant association between higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and reduced risks of Colorectal cancer (CRC) in both genders [21].",98053d36-351c-4676-90c9-22475615bcac
9,discussion2," However, risk reduction in our study is far different from previous studies. This difference could represent a random variation, favored by the small sample size of some studies, or could be due to adjustment for different confounders, using self-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s in some of studies which are prone to self-report bias, whereas we administered face-to face interview by trained interviewers.  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern emphasizes the consumption of plant foods. Phytochemical and other antioxidants in these foods exert their anti-tumorigenic characteristics via inhibition of Colorectal cancer (CRC) cell growth (suppression of NF-κB pathway), inducing apoptosis, and reaction with reactive oxygen species [37, 38]. Further, they can interact with CRA and Colorectal cancer (CRC) cell growth by blocking the natural cell cycle [39].",a504f45e-7416-4973-a1ff-c3e3477a4858
10,discussion3," Fiber content of plant foods is known to reduce the risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRA by increasing fecal volume, decreasing transit time, and therefore, decreasing the interaction of carcinogen with colonic epithelium, production of short chain fatty acids, and insulin resistance [40, 41]. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is also low in red and processed meat; indeed, the high fat content of red meat, and heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons produced from cocking meat at high temperatures, in addition to nitrosyl-heme molecules in processed meats that result in N-nitroso compounds formation, are associated with increased risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRA [42, 43].",6dcc848e-788d-4b9d-b138-b27d8b81838a
11,discussion4," The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet also advocates lower intakes of sugar-sweetened beverages; although the relationship between such beverages and Colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRA has not been fully confirmed, hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) consequential to consumption of these drinks can effect on carcinogenesis and conversion of adenomas to malignancies through crucial pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)) pathway and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway [44–46]. An important feature of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is low sodium intake; accordingly, results of studies on the association of sodium and higher risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) are not particularly strong, but some studies have reported positive associations between sodium and Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk [47].",86e99988-8e8f-485a-9adc-5f891a941a53
12,discussion5," Indeed, considering the synergic interaction between components of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern and Colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRA, rather than individual components, can be helpful in providing public messages to reduce the risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC), and CRA as a precursor of Colorectal cancer (CRC).  Although this study presents an important and novel addition to the literature, there are some limitations that should be considered. First, recall and selection bias cannot be avoided in case-control studies; however, we sought to minimize such biases by recruiting incident cases along with hospital controls. Second, we did not have information about hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and oral contraceptive (OCP) use in women, so the results could be affected by them, and they should be considered as potentially confounding variables in future work.",8d5ff2c5-e008-4a69-a643-d038a9340197
13,discussion6," Another limitation of our study is that although sample size is not low, when we classified participants according to various factors, the number of people decreased in each quartile. Concomitant to the aforementioned limitations, our study has some strengths that are noteworthy. First, to our knowledge, this is the first study on the association of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score and the risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRA in Iran, and in the Middle East. Second, we used Fung’s method to calculate Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, which includes wider ranges of possible scores (1 through 5), while some scores, such as Dixon’s, have only two values for components (0 for not meeting and 1 for meeting recommendations) [23]. Third, we used a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), administered by trained nutritionists, to more accurately estimate the main exposure [27].",2432ba9f-342f-46c9-a96a-b284541f8e87
14,discussion7,"  Conclusion  In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated that adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern could reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and colorectal adenomas in men and women. Moreover, promoting a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan, as a balanced and healthy diet, in dietary guidelines could be helpful in reducing the risk of Colorectal cancer (CRC) in less-developed countries.
