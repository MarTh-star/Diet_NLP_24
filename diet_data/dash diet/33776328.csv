0,methods0," 2.1. Study Participants  We studied participants from the baseline survey of the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort Study, in the Chongqing and Chengdu region. We included 44,900 Han Chinese participants aged between 30 and 79 years from 17 districts in southwestern China from September 2018 to January 2019. Briefly, the study participants were recruited using a multistage, stratified cluster sampling method. Detailed data collection information has previously been presented [19]. Of these participants, the study included 24,422 women.  We excluded participants if they had incomplete information (n = 574), and those with AM earlier than 8 years or later than 22 years (n = 43). The analysis included 23,805 individuals in the evaluation of the association between AM and hypertension.",284d9671-9a0f-4758-8b40-e9f601bbe8af
1,methods1," Furthermore, we excluded participants who used antihypertensive drugs (n = 3137), and the final analysis included 20,668 individuals to evaluate the association between AM and systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (Figure 1). All participants provided written informed consent prior to the survey. This survey was approved by the ethics committee of Sichuan University (No. K2016038).  2.2. Data Collection and Laboratory Measurement  A face-to-face electronic questionnaire survey was conducted by interviewers to collect sociodemographic characteristics (age, marital status, education, socioeconomic status, etc.), lifestyle characteristics (smoking status, alcohol drinking, physical activity, dietary behavior, etc.), reproductive factors (AM, prior pregnancy status, use of oral contraceptive pills, etc.), and family history of disease. Participants were divided into three groups (<45 years, 45–65 years, >65 years).",69a716d3-f750-4d3f-8da0-c225eb23b275
2,methods2," Marital status was grouped into married/cohabitated and other, including separated, divorced, widowed, and unmarried. Education level was classified into primary school or illiterate, junior high school, high school, junior college, and above. Socioeconomic status was determined by yearly household income (<CNY 12,000, CNY 12,000–19,999, CNY 20,000–59,999, CNY 60,000–99,999, ≥CNY 100,000). Smoking status was grouped into never, current, and ever smoker. Alcohol drinking status was categorized into never or hardly, occasionally, and often. Physical activity level was estimated based on metabolic equivalent (metabolic equivalent (MET)) with a dichotomized variable using 18.12 h/day as the cutoff point according to the median. A food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary behavior, which was calibrated through preliminary investigation.",dec66b4d-3267-4d46-bc35-4e5b964708e7
3,methods3," The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) score for each participant was based on food frequency information, which has been described in detail previously [20]. Additionally, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been proven to have beneficial effects on decreasing blood pressure (BP) [21]. In the present study, we assigned 7 kinds of food a score of 1 to 5 according to the quintile of the average food intake [22,23]. For whole grains, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, legumes, and dairy products, a score of 5 was given for the highest quintile, and a score of 1 was given for the lowest quintile. For red meat products and sodium, this pattern of scoring was inverted. Then, all the food scores were summed to obtain an overall Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score.",5b844c85-1f1b-4756-ab66-d27d7a799ed4
4,methods4," Participants were categorized into a high score group (>22) and a low score group (≤22) based on the median of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score.  After fasting for 12 h, venous blood samples were collected from all participants and tested at the Di’an Medical Laboratory Center. Dyslipidemia was diagnosed as a serum total cholesterol concentration of ≥6.2 mmol/L, triacylglycerol concentration of ≥2.3 mmol/L, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration of ≥4.1 mmol/L, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration of <1.0 mmol/L, or a self-reported diagnosis of dyslipidemia [24]. Participants were regarded as having diabetes if any of the following three items were met: fasting blood glucose level of ≥7.0 mmol/L, glycosylated hemoglobin percentage of ≥6.5%, or a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes [25]. Body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m2) and categorized into <24, 24–27.9 and ≥28 groups.",9f8141f9-2cd8-4d6d-bc15-6b7c65afed31
5,methods5," According to the weight criteria for adults in China [26], overweight was defined as 24 ≤ body mass index (BMI) ≤ 27.9 kg/m2, and obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg/m2.  2.3. Age at Menarche Assessment  Information about self-reported age at menarche was collected through the question: “At what age did your first menstruation begin?” Further to this, all participants were divided into a ≤14 years group and a >14 years group based on the median as the cutoff point, with ≤14 years of age as the reference group.  2.4. Outcome Assessment  Each participant’s BP was measured by trained medical personnel using electronic sphygmomanometers. All the electronic sphygmomanometers were calibrated before measurement. Medical personnel strictly followed the American Heart Association’s standardized protocol for the measurement of BP [27]. All the BP measurements were performed three times with a seated, upright position after at least 5 min of rest.",138d9e67-9001-490c-bec4-71a8d6263264
6,methods6," Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) were calculated as the mean value of three measurements. In this analysis, hypertension was defined as having an average measured systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg, or self-reported diagnosis of hypertension [28,29].  2.5. Statistical Analysis  We carried out descriptive analyses of participants’ characteristics for the considered variables. All continuous variables were described as the median (Q1, Q3), while categorical variables were summarized as percentages. For the analysis of differences between the AM ≤ 14 years group and the AM > 14 years group, a Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the differences among continuous variables, and a chi–square test was used to compare the differences among categorical variables.",c2f7f184-f84f-4b47-97db-db98810d8f3f
7,methods7,"  To evaluate the association between AM and hypertension, we used binary logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for hypertension. Multivariable linear regression was applied to investigate AM and its associations with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). In this analysis, we performed three models. The crude model was unadjusted for any covariates. In other words, the univariate analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between AM and blood pressure. Then, multiple regression analysis was carried out using models 1 and 2 in order to further understand the association between AM and blood pressure.",c0e71584-68b4-4948-89c7-e7d11b54a519
8,methods8," Model 1 was adjusted for age, marital status, education level, yearly household income, smoking status, alcohol drinking status, physical activity, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (when stratification was carried out, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was excluded), prior pregnancy status, use of oral contraceptive pills, family history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Model 2 was also adjusted for body mass index (BMI). As body mass index (BMI) may represent a mediation factor rather than a confounder associated with AM and hypertension [30,31], we adjusted body mass index (BMI) in a separate model. To examine potential effect modifiers, stratification analyses by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and age at recruitment were conducted in three models.  All the analyses were carried out in SPSS 25.0, and a two-tailed p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",9c89c4ab-0e20-4c1a-88ec-09a133c941cf
9,methods9," Restricted cubic spline regression was drawn using the ggplot2 and rms packages of the R software 4.1.1 to evaluate the shape of the relationship between menarche age and the odds ratio of hypertension by assigning knots at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles; the reference value was AM of 14 years.  3. Results  3.1. General Characteristics of the Participants  The general characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 1. Among the 23,805 participants, the mean menarche age was 14.36 years (range from 8 to 22 years), and the percentage of participants with AM later than 14 years was 40.18% (9565/23,805). Participants with AM > 14 years were statistically older than participants with AM ≤ 14 years, had a higher body mass index (BMI), and were more likely to have experienced pregnancy, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension.",ec17afbe-5656-4fbf-9df0-8dd15aa0e508
10,methods10," In addition, compared to those with AM > 14 years, participants with AM ≤ 14 years were more likely to be married, had a higher level of education, had greater exposure to smoking, had a higher physical activity level and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, were more likely to have a family history of hypertension and had higher oral contraceptive pill usage.  Overall, the prevalence of hypertension was 28.73% (6838/23,805) in our study population. Among the 6838 hypertension patients, the percentage of patients with self-reported diagnosis of hypertension was 51.36% (3512/6838), and the percentage of patients with hypertension detected by blood pressure tests in the survey was 48.64% (3326/6838).  3.2. Association between AM and Hypertension  Figure 2 displays the association between menarche age and hypertension among all study participants.

Furthermore, after adjusting for multiple variables in model 1, each one-year higher menarche was associated with a 2% increase in hypertension (OR 1.02, 95%CI 1.01–1.04, p = 0.007); this association was still statistically significant when we further adjusted for body mass index (BMI) (OR 1.04, 95%CI 1.02–1.05, p < 0.001).  The results for the cubic spline regression analyses are shown in Figure 3. The association between AM and hypertension was demonstrated as an approximately nonlinear tendency. Above 14 years, the odds ratio of hypertension steadily increased with the increasing menarche age versus the reference group (AM = 14 years) in models 1 and 2. However, below 14 years, the association between AM and hypertension was not statistically significant in models 1 and 2.",fe057efb-9455-49e9-b747-e0b6286f7e76
12,methods12,"  Figure 2 shows the association between AM and hypertension by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. We observed that the positive association between AM and hypertension was presented only in the low Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score group. For the low Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score group, those with AM > 14 years were more likely to have hypertension (OR 1.15, 95%CI 1.05–1.26, p = 0.003; OR 1.19, 95%CI 1.09–1.31, p < 0.001, respectively) compared to participants with AM ≤ 14 years in models 1 and 2. Furthermore, in models 1 and 2, each one-year higher menarche was associated with 3% and 4% increases in hypertension (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01–1.05, p = 0.013; OR 1.04, 95%CI 1.02–1.06, p < 0.001, respectively).

13,methods13,"  The results of the subgroup analysis by age at recruitment concerning the association between AM and hypertension are shown in Table 2.

Further stratification analysis by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score among middle-aged participants showed that, after adjusting for multiple variables in models 1 and 2, those with AM > 14 years versus those with AM ≤ 14 years had a higher odds ratio for hypertension in the low Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group than those in the high Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group.  3.3.",834c121d-65ee-4adc-b82a-f6eb7e054f00

However, the association between AM and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was no longer significant for the two Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score groups in models 1 and 2 (p > 0.05).  4. Discussion  Our study found that later menarche (>14 years) was associated with an increased risk of hypertension and elevated levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP) after adjusting for multiple variables, including body mass index (BMI), in southwest China among the total population. In addition, as AM increased, women had higher odds ratio values for hypertension in participants with AM > 14 years. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess whether dietary patterns can modify the relationship between AM and hypertension among Han Chinese women aged 30 to 79 years.",60edb4ee-3b83-4528-9c9c-5051dde36944
16,methods17," We found that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet modified the positive relationship between AM and hypertension, as this positive association was presented only in the low Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score group among all study participants. However, this association was not found in the high Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score group. The results provide novel individual-level prevention measures for hypertension in participants with AM > 14 years.  Our findings were consistent with previous studies that found that later menarche age was associated with a higher risk of hypertension [13,14,17]. The cubic spline regression results further identified a positive association between AM and hypertension, as the odds ratio for hypertension steadily increased with the increasing menarche age in AM > 14 years participants. However, no significant association was found for AM and hypertension in participants with AM ≤ 14 years.",e7a7647b-26f6-4387-8722-eee78e7d5a3a
17,methods18," This is the reason why all the participants in the present study were divided into two groups based on AM 14 years as the cutoff point. These potential mechanisms can partly explain the positive association between AM and hypertension. Studies have shown that late menarche is associated with low levels of estrogen, ovarian hormone, and growth hormone [32,33]; these hormones can reduce blood pressure and protect women from hypertension and cardiovascular disease [34,35,36,37]. However, our findings were inconsistent with a few previous studies. An analysis of 7893 urban women aged 45 years and older found that AM was not associated with hypertension [12]. Zhang et al. enrolled 15,361 rural Chinese postmenopausal women from Henan, China and found early menarche was associated with a higher risk of hypertension [31].",0718fd43-f0fc-4880-b741-fa06f4b9d201
18,methods19," These inconsistent findings might be related to differences in sample size, region, menarche age grouping, and considered confounders; for example, dietary factors are strongly associated with hypertension. However, few previous studies have adjusted for diet status, perhaps leading to statistical bias. To our knowledge, the present study is the first study to examine the relationship between AM and hypertension after adjusting for dietary pattern.  Compared with previous studies, we innovatively conducted stratification analysis by Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. The results revealed that those who had a history of AM > 14 years with a low Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score remained at an increased risk of hypertension compared with AM ≤ 14 years women; however, this positive association was not found in the high Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score group among all study participants.",bc4408b5-df9d-4a74-9060-f619481ebeb8
19,methods20," The difference in results of the two groups indicated the necessity to stratify by Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and implied that dietary patterns play an important role in the relationship between AM and hypertension. In other words, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may have modified the relationship between AM and hypertension. To our knowledge, no study has explored the possible mechanisms of a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet effect for AM and hypertension. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is rich in legumes, which are the only dietary source of isoflavones, imparting estrogen’s physiological effects into humans [38]. Therefore, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet’s inclusion of a high amount of legumes may mediate the effect that late menarche has on increased risk of hypertension.",e9752242-970e-4e59-aa96-8442ffa350e4
20,methods21," This may help to partially explain the absence of any positive association for women with late menarche in the high Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score group in the present study. Of course, other foods included in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may also be related to the association between AM and hypertension, such as fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, and dairy products. Therefore, more evidence on the mechanisms of the different relationships between AM and hypertension in the high Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and low Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score groups is needed in the future. As mentioned above, the results suggested that late menarche women should pay more attention to blood pressure, and those who have a history of AM > 14 years should incorporate more Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet foods for prevention of hypertension.",efde6415-b61e-42cd-ac1c-2a038db927e3
21,methods22," This may provide novel individual-level prevention measures for hypertension in participants with AM > 14 years.  Moreover, we conducted stratified analysis by age at recruitment. The result revealed that those with AM > 14 years remained at an increased risk of hypertension compared with participants with AM ≤ 14 years in the middle-aged group; however, this positive association was not found in the young and old groups. The difference in the results of the three groups indicated the necessity to stratify by age at recruitment. Additionally, this interesting result implies that age at recruitment plays an important role in the relationship between AM and hypertension. There are two possible reasons why the positive association was not present in young or old people. The first reason may be the different metabolic function in young and old people compared with the middle-aged population.",bacd92ee-05a2-4fca-9d1f-05ccbc5f13d6
22,methods23," It may also be related to the data structure itself, where the prevalence of hypertension is very low (6.85%, 538/7858) among young people, and the proportion of those with AM ≤ 14 years and AM > 14 years is not balanced (25.44%, 74.56%) among old people, which may make it difficult to identify the relationship between age at menarche and hypertension. Furthermore, a stratified analysis by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was conducted in the middle-aged population, and we found that those with AM > 14 years versus those with AM ≤ 14 years had a higher odds ratio for hypertension in the low Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group than those in the high Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group among middle-aged participants.",eb31c7ea-f900-44a9-b99d-cda247bb0d6e
23,methods24," This result also partly supports the speculation that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may have a potential modification effect for the positive relationship between menarche age and hypertension.  In addition, we evaluated the associations between AM and systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the entire population. Our results showed that later menarche was associated with higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), but this association was not significant for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The reasons for the different effects of AM on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were unknown, and this needs to be explored further. In the present study, we also examined whether dietary patterns modified the associations between AM and systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP).",593da2aa-4a68-46ae-a8af-a434d422806e
24,methods25," Our findings showed that the strength of association for AM and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the low Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score group was stronger compared with the high Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score group, which implied that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet pattern may decrease the effect of AM on systolic blood pressure (SBP). Those results further support the theory that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may mediate the effect that late menarche has on increased risk of hypertension, possibly related to food included in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, such as legumes.  One of the strengths of the present study is that it included an exploration of the relationship between AM and hypertension for the first time using large-scale cross-sectional study data in southwest China.",20e7b9fc-e8cd-446b-8563-51e5cf1a1645
25,methods26," Chongqing and Chengdu are adjacent cities, located in the southwest of China, with similar lifestyle habits, environmental conditions, and economic levels; thus, large samples from Chongqing and Chengdu are representative of southwest China. Moreover, we comprehensively considered related confounders to explore the relationship between AM and hypertension in this study, particularly dietary patterns, which have not been taken into account in previous studies. In addition, taking the influence of dietary patterns on the association between AM and hypertension into consideration, we innovatively conducted this analysis, stratifying by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, and found that dietary patterns may modify the relationship between AM and hypertension. However, this study has several limitations.",2767a4ed-56bb-4d3c-a58a-6bb8b3ce12f9
26,methods27," Firstly, our study data were cross-sectional results from a cohort study; cross-sectional data analysis limited our ability to explore the causal relationship between AM and hypertension, for which prospective studies will be needed. Secondly, AM was retrospectively assessed by a question, which may cause recall bias. However, previous studies have found that AM by recall highly matched original adolescent reports [39,40], suggesting that AM by recall could be applied in scientific research. In addition, AM by recall has also been used in other similar studies of the relationship between AM and hypertension [14,30]. Thirdly, the present study found that systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased by 0.29 mmHg with each one-year increase in menarche, which is clinically insignificant. Thus, caution should be taken in clinical applications. Fourthly, our study was limited due to age and ethnicity, so extrapolating the results to other age groups and ethnicity populations should be noted.  5.",bb2a5d49-caf7-4055-bbd3-53edeb58a83a

After stratification by age at recruitment, the positive association between menarche age and hypertension only remained in the middle-aged group. In addition, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may modify the relationship between AM and hypertension, as this positive association was present only in the low Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score group after stratification by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score among all study participants; however, this association was not found in the high Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score group.",4bb6b607-3d1b-40dc-947f-36d9368b6b18
