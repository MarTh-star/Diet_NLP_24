0,introduction0,"Although often underemphasized in clinical practice, a mainstay of therapy for all individuals with hypertension is lifestyle modification [1]. One such modification that effectively lowers BP in adults is the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) diet [2,3]. Benefits of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet have been established in various patient populations; however, its efficacy in individuals with reduced kidney function is not well studied. In fact, the presence of kidney disease was a criterion for participant exclusion from major Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) studies [4,5]. Because 69% of US adults with Chronic Kidney Disease (Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)) are estimated to have uncontrolled hypertension, identifying and employing multiple strategies to lower blood pressure may help improve hypertension control rates [6].",3c87d3b8-681b-4547-98cb-5e2e3c7b587f
1,introduction1," Assessing whether kidney function modifies both the BP lowering effect and safety profile of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is an appropriate first step in determining whether this intervention is a viable treatment option for patients with comorbid Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and hypertension.  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and low in fat, sweets, and added sugars. It emphasizes healthy sources of protein, such as, lean meats, nuts, seeds, and legumes. The resultant nutritional profile is high in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and protein.",206d1b1f-128d-4729-899b-9eb4b42771f9
2,introduction2," Because high intake of these nutrients may cause significant metabolic derangements and increased morbidity in some individuals with reduced kidney function, current kidney disease outcome quality initiative guidelines do not recommend routine adoption of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet by patients with moderate disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) [7]. However, mounting data suggests that a diet high in fruits and vegetables can be safely consumed by patients with early and even advanced Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) [8,9]. It is also more widely recognized that the dietary sources of phosphorus (inorganic vs. organic) and protein (animal vs. plant derived) influence the bioavailability and potential health effects of these nutrients, with organic phosphorus and plant derived protein being less harmful [10-13].",39a9d880-3f9f-4e74-9b4a-810548c8e4d9
3,introduction3," Hence, it seems appropriate to reassess the validity of traditional dietary restrictions that are often recommended for patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The above findings support the relevancy of taking a closer look at the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, a diet high in fruits and vegetables, organic phosphorus, and plant derived protein, to determine whether it may be appropriate at reduced levels of kidney function for hypertension management.  In this secondary analysis of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium trial, which includes participants with preserved or mildly reduced kidney function, we evaluated whether the BP lowering effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is modified by eGFR. We also evaluated whether the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet negatively impacted kidney-related laboratory measures as eGFR declined. ",17c5819b-0fb7-4f0e-adda-a9582e50efb5
4,methods0,"The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium trial was a multi-center, randomized, controlled human feeding study that evaluated the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet at three levels of sodium intake on BP in adults with pre-hypertension or untreated stage I hypertension. Detailed descriptions of trial methods and main results have been previously published [3,4]. An Institutional Review Board at each participating study site approved the research protocol. All participants provided written informed consent and a Data and Safety Monitoring Board provided trial oversight.  Study population Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium participants were ≥22 years old with mean Systolic BP (Systolic BP (SBP)) of 120-159 mmHg and mean Diastolic BP (Diastolic BP (DBP)) of 80-95 mmHg.",c1a72800-94c8-451e-aa76-a3cb3fc3fc68

Kidney disease was defined as either a serum creatinine >1.2 mg/dl for women and >1.5 mg/dl for men (unless eGFR was ≥60 ml/min per Cockcroft-Gault equation) [14] or ≥2+ protein on urine dipstick regardless of serum creatinine.  Trial design After a 2 week run-in period, participants were randomized to receive either the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or a control diet in parallel group design. The composition of each diet is shown in Table 1.",8355888a-c7cd-4278-a709-0ab549e65955
6,methods2," Assigned diets were administered for three consecutive 30-day feeding periods each at a low (1150 mg/d), intermediate (2300 mg/d), and high (3450 mg/d) sodium level in random crossover fashion. Participants were provided all of their food, including cooked meals and snacks. Energy intake was adjusted to keep weight constant during the study.  Measurements Our analyses included only those participants for whom both stored pre-intervention plasma and urine specimens were available, which allowed us to measure necessary labs to assess baseline eGFR, albuminuria and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) status. We used Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium trial data to evaluate change in BP from the beginning to the end of the 30-day high sodium (3450 mg/d) feeding period, which was the sodium intake typical of most Americans at the time and equivalent to the sodium level provided in the original Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial [2].",6c48789c-b985-4463-9bc9-5124bec16b9e
7,methods3, Weight at screening visit 3 was used as baseline weight. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared.  Blood pressure Detailed description of the BP measurement protocol has been previously published [3]. BP measurements obtained during the screening and run-in phases were averaged to determine baseline BP. Those obtained during the first week of the high sodium intervention period were averaged to determine pre-intervention BP used in our analysis. Measurements obtained during five of the last nine days of the high sodium intervention period were averaged to determine post-intervention BP.  Laboratory data Fasting plasma specimens and 24-hour urine collections were obtained during screening and the last week of each intervention period and subsequently frozen at −70°C.,f660d415-48d6-40ac-a92b-a947e5f76603
8,methods4," We retrieved and thawed available frozen plasma specimens to measure phosphorus (colorimetric method), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH; electrochemiluminescence immunoassay), and creatinine (kinetic Jaffe method). Urine specimens were thawed to measure albumin (immunoturbidimetric method) and creatinine concentrations (LabCorp, Burlington, NC). Frozen specimens had no prior freeze-thaw cycles. We were unable to measure plasma potassium and calcium concentrations because blood was collected into vacutainers containing Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA)), an anticoagulant that contains potassium salts and chelates calcium, resulting in inaccurate potassium and calcium measurements.  Estimated GFR was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation [15].",fbf1003e-2816-4bff-8a2e-c78c07ef5cf1
9,methods5," Participants were classified as having albuminuria if baseline urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR)) was ≥17 mg/g in men or ≥25 mg/g in women [16]. Based on a single plasma and urine sample collected during the screening period, participants were classified as having Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) if eGFR was <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or if albuminuria was present at any eGFR. Participants with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) were classified into the following standard stages: Stage 1=eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 with albuminuria, Stage 2=eGFR of 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2 with albuminuria, and Stage 3=eGFR of 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2.  Outcomes Primary outcomes were change in Systolic BP (SBP) and Diastolic BP (DBP) during the 30 day high sodium intervention period, comparing Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) to control by level of kidney function.",86e64556-ced5-4ea0-a479-9f83b5e4ff9c

18,discussion0,"In this secondary analysis of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium trial, we were able to evaluate the impact of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on BP, markers of mineral metabolism, and kidney function as well as how these relationships may be influenced by level of kidney function. After a 4-week feeding intervention in adults with pre-hypertension and untreated stage 1 hypertension, we confirmed previous findings from the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium trial and other feeding studies that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet lowers Systolic BP (SBP), even in a subpopulation with mildly decreased kidney function [2,3,17].",77cbd7f1-397a-4aa6-b99d-f2747afaa43c
19,discussion1," Although we did not observe an association between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and change in Diastolic BP (DBP), phosphorus, creatinine, or eGFR, we did observe an associated reduction in iPTH and an associated increase in urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on BP, markers of mineral metabolism, and kidney function were not modified by baseline kidney function. Presence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) was also not observed to affect the impact of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) on BP or kidney-related outcomes. Thus, in this small subset of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium participants, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was effective in lowering Systolic BP (SBP) without major adverse effects on kidney parameters, across a wide range of eGFR.",86ed2d88-4ba3-48a9-a666-9ff626deb836
20,discussion2,"  Our aim was to determine if kidney function modified the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on BP. Current knowledge about the management of hypertension in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), as well as the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet in various patient subgroups, could lead to two opposing hypotheses. On one hand, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may be hypothesized to have a smaller BP lowering effect as eGFR declines because patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) tend to have more difficult to control hypertension than those with preserved kidney function. For example, patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) have a higher prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension and require a greater number of medications to achieve BP goals when compared to those without Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) [6,18,19].",3db2fd5c-37f1-4f7a-8bd3-32852f95c48e
21,discussion3," On the other hand, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may be hypothesized to have a greater BP lowering effect as eGFR declines because previous studies have shown that it reduces BP to a greater degree when hypertension is more severe (i.e., there was greater reduction in BP for participants with hypertension than those with prehypertension) [20]. However, in the current study, neither eGFR nor the presence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) modified the BP lowering effect of this dietary intervention, at least for the range of eGFR assessed. This suggests that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may have a similar effect on BP for those with mild to moderate Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) as it does for those with preserved kidney function.",48eed06f-4c9f-4606-8d7d-227251963804
22,discussion4,"  Evidence that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet reduces BP is insufficient alone to recommend it to patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) because evidence of its safety is also required. Unfortunately, we were unable to directly measure serum concentrations of key electrolytes, such as potassium and calcium. Our small sample size of participants with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) further limits or ability to compare those with reduced and preserved kidney function. Presumably at a certain eGFR, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet could in fact cause a rise in these serum electrolytes; the “safe range” of eGFR is yet to be determined.  To our knowledge, an association between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and changes in plasma iPTH or phosphorus has not been demonstrated.",ac819251-fed0-4101-a7f7-cd99c528524f
23,discussion5," Under normal conditions, serum calcium and phosphorus are tightly regulated by interplay between both vitamin D and parathyroid hormones which act on bone, the intestines, and the kidneys to maintain physiologic balance. A previous study demonstrated urinary excretion of both calcium and phosphorus to be higher for participants on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet compared to the control diet, reflecting higher dietary intake [21]. Unexpectedly, we noted a significant reduction in plasma iPTH for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group. We suspect that higher concentrations of serum calcium and/or vitamin D (neither of which were evaluated in this study) may explain this finding.  Estimates of renal function were not altered by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, despite its higher protein content.",142bde95-694f-4024-b08d-bb4535300ad7
24,discussion6," Restricting protein for individuals with reduced kidney function remains controversial since important clinical trials that evaluated whether protein restriction slows disease progression were inconclusive or showed only modest benefit [22,23]. Our data suggest that a slightly higher protein intake (18% in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) vs 15% in control) does not lead to acute reductions in kidney function in the setting of mild Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). We did observe a modest increase in estimated daily urine albumin excretion for participants on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet compared to those on the control diet (net increase of 5.6 mg). This is likely a reflection of increased protein consumption rather than glomerular disease. However, the potential long term implications of this change will need to be established.",d9baa450-9f67-4a00-892a-4103e37c4739
25,discussion7," We speculate that the BP lowering effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet would outweigh the potential risks of such a modest increase in urine albumin excretion.  We acknowledge that our study has some limitations. Inclusion of a small subset (22%) of participants who were enrolled in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium trial potentially introduces bias from unbalanced comparison groups. Compared to participants who were excluded, our subset was younger and had a higher Body Mass Index (BMI). However, in a subgroup analysis of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium trial the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet did not vary by age (>45 years) or Body Mass Index (BMI) (≥30 kg/m2) suggesting that this difference may not necessarily influence the expected impact of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) on BP in our study [24].",5ca08d53-1427-4611-ae0e-1eae0da1b529
26,discussion8," Another study limitation is our inability to directly measure key electrolytes, such as, potassium and calcium, due to plasma samples containing Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA). Assessing the impact of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on these electrolytes in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is essential to determine whether this intervention is a safe treatment option for hypertensive patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Perhaps most critical, our study is limited by the range of eGFR included and classifying participants as having Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on a single plasma and urine sample. Only 9% had eGFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, none less than 44 ml/min/1.73 m2, and only 13% were classified as having Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).",89944420-1916-4096-b42e-71d8626020fa
27,discussion9," A larger study in patients with lower kidney function is clearly needed to definitively establish the efficacy and safety of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet in this population, albeit with caution due to risk of hyperkalemia.  Conclusion In this small subset of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium participants, our findings suggest that kidney function, as measured by eGFR, does not modify the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on blood pressure or markers of mineral metabolism and kidney function. If confirmed in a larger population of patients with less preserved kidney function, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may be a valuable, nonpharmacologic strategy for BP control in individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).",7a990f8b-683a-4cf2-b4f9-ad0c92152057
