0,background0," Elevated concentrations of myostatin inhibit muscle growth, function and strength. Myostatin is a mediator of sarcopenia and is associated with insulin resistance. For this study we tested the response of a calorie-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) diet on changes in myostatin, follistatin, and mystatin:follistatin ratio levels after 12 weeks in comparison to basline in adults aged 65 years and older. Furthermore we evaluated correlations between changes in myostatin, body composition and cardiometabolic biomarkers in this cohort of older adults. ",79c8b9b4-5508-4a69-89ee-631bc35b3043
1,methods0, This was a controlled-feeding diet intervention study in which females (n = 17) and males (n = 11) aged 65 years and older consumed either 85 g (n = 15) or 170 g (n = 13) of fresh lean beef within a standardized Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet for 12-weeks. Myostatin and follistatin concentrations were measured from fasted blood samples collected at 5 timepoints throughout the 12-week feeding intervention period. Correlations were assessed between changes in myostatin and follistatin levels and measures of body composition and cardiometabolic biomarkers. ,27b870ca-3d4d-4007-a974-8cb2dedbd380
2,analysis0," The statistical analysis plan for the present study is an extension of the original studies [18, 19] (ClinicalTrials.gov; Identifier: NCT04127240). An Independent Samples T test was used to assess differences in baseline characteristics, and myostatin, follistatin, and the myostatin:follistatin ratio between males and females. Differences between beef intake groups at week 12 was determined by Independent Samples T test. A linear mixed models analysis was applied to determine changes in the primary outcome variables across the intervention. A random intercept for each participant and Time (week 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12) as the fixed effect was used. The primary outcome of interest was the difference between baseline and week 12 for plasma concentrations of myostatin, follistatin, and the myostatin:follistatin ratio. When indicated by a significant Time effect, the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons was used to determine pairwise differences at specific time points.",df2d3d95-d375-44e0-9697-713e05926a8e
3,analysis1," To adjust for the influence of changes in body weight across the intervention on the primary outcome variables, we repeated the linear mixed model analyses by including body weight as a covariate. A sensitivity analyses was also completed with the exclusion of the three normal weight subjects. Data for males and females are pooled but also displayed separately by sex. Relations between the change from baseline in myostatin concentrations and cardiometabolic variables, and body composition variables were determined by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. To identify the independent determinants of the change from baseline in myostatin levels, we performed stepwise multiple regression analysis. In each multiple regression model, variables with a related probability of greater than 0.10 were removed. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Data are presented as means (SD) and analyzed with SPSS version 24 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY, USA).",ec55b5c7-714a-468f-999f-c2e8308dde3c

Additional studies, such as the present analysis are extensions of the original study (ClinicalTrials.gov; Identifier: NCT04127240). Thus, sample size was estimated based on an expected 22% improvement in the sit-to-stand test following 6-weeks of a high protein diet in 16 elderly adults. Using these estimates, sample sizes were calculated based on 80% power at an alpha level of 0.05 to detect an absolute mean improvement of 4 ± 3 repetitions in the 30-s sit-to-stand test. Resulting sample sizes were 14 participants per group, respectively. ",71d342dd-5146-45db-b677-e5559315dd05

11,discussion0," This highly controlled feeding study sought to evaluate the impact of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on changes in myostatin and follistatin concentrations and assess whether these changes were associated with measures of body composition and markers of cardiometabolic health in a cohort of sedentary older adults. In response to the 12-week diet intervention, we observed a significant decrease in myostatin concentrations. Furthermore, relationships between myostatin, body composition changes and biomarkers of cardiovascular health and insulin sensitivity emerged.  Myostatin decreased in older adults consuming the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and was correlated with changes in body composition  In the present study under controlled-feeding conditions, circulating myostatin levels significantly decreased in all participants by 17.6% (p = 0.006). There was no difference in myostatin when separated by meat intake groups (85 g vs. 170 g).",635e51f8-4606-494c-b98c-08458912b5ea
12,discussion1," The 17.6% reduction in myostatin was correlated with a 4.7% reduction in waist circumference [18] (R2 = 0.163; p = 0.033; Fig. 2A) and a 12.2% decrease in absolute fat mass [18] (R2 = 0.233; p = 0.009; Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the percent reduction in fat mass independently predicted the decrease in myostatin (β = 0.501; p = 0.009). The relationship between myostatin and waist circumference has been previously reported. In a cross-sectional case-control study in young women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)), elevated myostatin levels were positively correlated with increased waist circumference in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) which may be suggestive of an increased risk for abdominal obesity [7].",0ab8c800-9075-498e-aa4f-da14cc2b4307
13,discussion2," Interestingly, adults with polymorphisims in the Myostatin (Myostatin (MSTN)) gene display higher waist circumference and total fat mass, implying that variations in the Myostatin (MSTN) gene may be an influential factor related to abdominal adiposity and obesity [23]. The relationship between elevated myostatin and obesity has been demonstrated in both rodent and human studies. For example, myostatin mRNA is increased in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissues in wild type mice fed a high fat diet and genetically obese mice [24]. Increased circulating and muscle myostatin concentrations have been reported in adults with extreme obesity (i.e. BMI of 49 kg/m2) and BMI is strongly correlated with muscle myostatin concentrations [25]. Conversely, reports from rodent studies show reductions in body fat levels with inhibition of myostatin either pharmacologically or through gene-knockout models [26–31].",241042e6-654a-4199-a6b7-8cc45cdf3249
14,discussion3," Human trials demonstrate decreased myostatin mRNA with weight loss due to either biliopancreatic diversion or gastric bypass surgery [31, 32]. Indeed, the outcomes of the present study in a cohort of obese older adults show associations between decreased myostatin and decreasesd waist circumference and fat mass in response to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet intervention and that decreased fat mass was an independent predictor for the decrease in myostatin. Although BMI decreased in response to the study diet [18], BMI was not correlated with myostatin in the present study. Taken together, these results suggest that in addition to pharmacological and surgical methods, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet maybe a potential strategy to reduce myostatin levels with concurrent parallel changes in adiposity that may in-turn benefit individulas with obesity.

15,discussion4,"6% reduction in circulating myostatin with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet intervention was significantly related to beneficial changes in skeletal muscle mass and strength in this cohort of older adults. We observed that the decrease in myostatin was associated with improvements in grip strength-to-weight ratio (i.e., as body mass decreased over time, grip strength increased across the intervention time period; R2 = 0.162; p = 0.034; Fig. 2C) and skeletal muscle mass-to-fat mass ratio (i.e., as skeletal muscle mass increased over time, fat mass decreased across the intervention time period; R2 = 0.176; p = 0.026; Fig. 2D). Notbly, we previously reported a correlation between improved grip strength-to-weight ratio and reduced waist circumference [19], both of which are associated with reduced myostatin reported in the present study.",9f753dd1-aa65-48ab-8793-55f7f66b4e28
16,discussion5," It is evident from a number of studies that increased myostatin levels are associated with reduced skeletal muscle mass and strength in humans [5, 33–35]. Furthmore, recent estimates indicate a 7.6 increased odds of low grip strength in older adults with elevated myostatin levels [5]. Findings from this study extend these prior studies by showing that the improvement in grip strength-to-weight ratio was an independent predictor of the decrease in myostatin (β = − 0.419; p = 0.014). Since grip strength alone serves as the dominant predictor for poor health outcomes in older adults, the results of the present study would be of vital importance to older individulas as the outcomes suggest that decreased myostatin is associated with improved relative body strength. This is important because decreased activities of daily living and reduced walking mobility in older adults is due in part to poor body strength (i.e. decreased strength-to-weight ratio and muscle mass).",58db29c5-7ff0-4aba-97cc-7ddf6cebd4b0
17,discussion6," Poor body strength increases the risk of falls that in-turn lead to mobile disability in older adults. By improving the grip strength to weight ratio, older individuals may able to perform activities of daily living, including walking, bathing and stair climbing at a lower percentage of their strength capacity, thus, reducing the physical effort required to perform everyday activities. The association between decreased myostatin and improved skeletal muscle mass-to-fat mass ratio observed in the present study may be explained, in part, by an indirect effect of increased muscle mass and/or loss of myostatin signaling in muscle rather than an effect of the loss myostatin signaling in adipose tissue [28].  From a cardiometabolic health perspective, these outcomes are critical given that skeletal muscle is the largest consumer of glucose (> 80% of insulin-mediated glucose metabolism occurs in skeletal muscle [36]) and plays a central role with insulin sensitivity.",05a80bbc-0d8c-4ff0-bf28-57bd541228bb
18,discussion7," Thus, the reductions in myostatin with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet coupled with improvements in skeletal muscle mass and strength, may underlie the beneficial changes in cardiometabolic health and insulin sensitivy observed in the present study.  Decreased myostatin concentrations are associated with decreased concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-C, insulin and HOMA-IR  Outcomes of the present study show that in response to the study diet the 17.6% reduction in myostatin was associated with reductions in total cholesterol (R2 = 0.193; p = 0.0196; Fig. 3A) and LDL-C (R2 = 0.163; p = 0.033; Fig. 3B). It is well-known that total cholesterol and LDL-C serve as biomarkers in the lipid profile for cardiovascular disease [37]. However the role that myostatin plays with these biomarkers remains unknown.",7819ac01-2539-440a-a06c-073209d1b885
19,discussion8," A rodent study using a myostatin/LDL-C double-knockout mouse model reported reduced LDL-C concentrations along with reduced free fatty acids and triglycerides in response to a high-fat/high cholesterol diet compared to the LDL-C knockout control [38]. In a human study, however, a negative relationship was reported in-which decreased LDL-C was associated with increased myostatin in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [39]. Results from the present study show that in response to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet intervention decreased myostatin was correlated with decreased LDL-C in a cohort of obese older adults. With conflicting results and very few reports, more studies are required to understand the relationship between myostatin and cholesterol.  In the present study, the 17.6% decrease in myostatin was associated with a 13.4% decrease in insulin [19] (R2 = 0.234; p = 0.009; Fig. 3C) and 25% reduction in HOMA-IR [18] (R2 = 0.248; p = 0.007; Fig. 3D).",70c02232-ea9a-4478-834a-26f48dcef5b2
20,discussion9," Moreover, we previously reported a 8.4% decrease in fasted blood glucose concentrations and correlations between decreased waist circumference and decreased insulin and HOMA-IR [19]. While it is well-established that a primary action of myostatin is to inhibit muscle growth, new evidence suggests it can also play a key role contributing to metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance [25, 28, 40, 41]. For example, myostatin expression in skeletal muscle was reported to be negatively associated with insulin sensitivity in adults aged 54–77 years described as either overwight or obese [41]. Additionally, increased myostatin in muscle has also been reported in metabolic conditions associated with insulin resistance such as type 2 diabetes [31] and dysglycemia [40]. These findings are consistent with those of Hittel et al. [25] who showed that greater myostatin protein content in skeletal muscle of obese adults was associated with worse HOMA-IR.",7730d2bd-8158-4f4a-9f0e-1c7af18f641b
21,discussion10," Other in vitro studies have shown that myostatin inhibits glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner in placental cell lines [42]. Conversely, disruption of the myostatin gene in a high-fat diet mouse model prevents diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance [27]. Intriguing findings by Guo et al. [28] showed that myostatin knockout mice displayed greater insulin sensitivity compared to wild type mice. Interestingly, this outcome remained after controlling for increased muscle mass, implying that myostatin may have unfavorable effects on insulin sensitivity that are independent of reduced muscle mass. This could potentially exacerbate the metabolic effects of sarcopenic obesity given the decreased glucose uptake resulting from decreased muscle mass heightened by the inhibitory action of myostatin on insulin sensitivity.",4f5cdd01-d2df-4a63-8f2f-b82be775982f
22,discussion11," Collectively, these studies and others [26, 43] point to a growing body of evidence that increased myostatin is involved in contributing to metabolic dysfunction in the skeletal muscle of obese individuals, particularly when obesity is associated with metabolic abnormalities, suggesting that it may contribute to insulin resistance [25].  Interventions that have reported declines in skeletal muscle myostatin with improvements in insulin sensitivity and decreased body fat include gastric bypass surgery and exercise training [27, 38]. In muscle isolated from morbidly obese women before and one year after gastric bypass surgery, myostatin expression significantly decreased by 2.4-fold [32]. This reduction in skeletal muscle myostatin was significantly related to improved insulin sensitivity.",48102a53-b419-4980-9e30-9f3fc5861a18
23,discussion12," In a 12 week intervention that included aerobic exercise plus dietary restriction in middle-aged and older adults resulted in a decrease in skeletal muscle myostatin and body fat and increased insulin sensitivity [41]. Unfortunately, outcomes regarding muscle mass or strength were not reported. Similar to these findings we report that in response to a 12 week calorie-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet intervention (with no exercise intervention) in adults aged 65 years and older circulating myostatin concentrations decreased and were associated decreased fat mass as well as improved insulin sensitivity as measured by decreased circulating insulin and HOMA-IR.

Notably, we report that reduced fat mass and improved strength independently predict for the decrease in myostatin.

Taken together, these outcomes are suggestive of a primary modulatory influence of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on myostatin and imply that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may be a positive effective intervention in the older adult population.  Limitations  Limitations of this study include: (i) a control or comparison group was not tested; (ii) all participants self-identified as white American which represents the dominant ethnic group in South Dakota; (iii) all participants lived in their own homes and were mobile; (iv) no one resided in assisted living facilities and support was not required for daily living activities.",f60fa5f5-caf7-4876-9374-f2ddb81d6dd7

Conclusion  Results from this controlled-feeding diet intervention study suggest that a calorie-restriced Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has the ability to effectively reduce myostatin concentrations in adults aged 65 years and older. Moreover, the outcomes of the present study show that decreased myostatin levels are paired with improvements in muscle and cardiometabolic health and that muscle strength and fat mass may serve as independent predictors for myostatin concentrations. Results from this study also show that follistatin did not respond to the intervention diet.",b201bc7c-49fa-425c-a807-9c2a00c514ec
