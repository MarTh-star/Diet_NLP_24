0,methods0," 2.1. Study Population  This study is embedded in the ongoing “Hamburg City Health Study“ (Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS)). The Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) aims to build a cohort of finally 45,000 population-based participants in Hamburg  [15]. Eligible were individuals from 45 to 74 years of age at time of sampling and lived in Hamburg, Germany. Potential participants were randomly invited via the registration office. They received a letter with the data protection declaration and the first questionnaire. Later, they were invited to the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf (UKE)) if their language skills were sufficient to comprehend the questionnaires and instructions from the study personnel and able to participate in the medical examinations. All participants gave written informed consent.",abb6fdc5-ea49-4e40-b765-f04dc0cc1469
1,methods1," Participants’ data of this study were extracted from the dataset of the first sub-cohort Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) (n = 10,000). Data for this sub-cohort was collected between 2016 and 2019.  For this analysis, needed data was available for 4330 of 10,000 participants. Those with a prior history of heart attacks, strokes, and illnesses associated with the coronary vessels were excluded (n = 358) due to the potential confounder risk in association with the outcome variable MetS.  Margin age groups, which were disproportionally underrepresented in Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) compared to the reference population of the City of Hamburg, were excluded to reduce bias. The final sample size enclosed in this analysis amounts to n = 3513.  2.2. Outcome Variable—MetS  The outcome MetS was based on the definition of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) [1].",9ceaee28-cc73-4216-9a4a-6c3a3f19e23b
2,methods2," Height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure were measured by trained study nurses at the Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) study center, and blood samples were taken. Participants were asked to bring their medication packages, so their medication’s specific product codes (PZN, “Pharmazentralnummer”, a unique German barcode identifier for medicinal products) could be scanned. That allowed to determine whether the participants used a drug associated with parameters of the MetS.  To assign the status of MetS according to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), participants had to be abdominal adipose (waist circumference of >94 cm in men and of >80 cm in women). Additionally, at least 2 of the 4 following conditions must be fulfilled:Raised triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL or specific medication for this lipid abnormality.",a3cd7ff0-7051-4e7f-8847-49cd258faad2
3,methods3,"  Reduced HDL cholesterol (men < 40 mg/dL, women < 50 mg/dL) or specific medication for this lipid abnormality/  Raised blood pressure exceeds ≥ 130 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 85 mm Hg diastolic or medication of the previously diagnosed hypertension.  Raised fasting plasma glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.  2.3. Dietary Scores  Information on dietary intake was collected by validated questionnaires developed for the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)) study [16]. The used dietary questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire, version 2 (FFQ2)) records the frequency and portion size of 102 food items eaten during the previous year [16]. Relevant food groups, energy intake, and nutrients were assessed.",7c1f5e90-10f9-47db-9ab1-50f5b675fb99
4,methods4,"  Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) To calculate adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, a scoring scheme from Folsom et al. (2007) was used [17]. The overall score included 10 equally weighted food items (frequency consumption of grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy, meat/poultry/fish, nuts/seeds/legumes, sweets obtained from raw data) and average daily intakes of certain nutrients (fat, saturated fat, sodium) (Table 1). A score of 0–1 was assigned for each dietary component and summed across the 10 items [18]. A score of 10 reflected full adherence, while 0 represented non-adherence.  Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) To assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet, the validated German translation of the original Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) was used [19].",ed7c172b-328c-4e4e-91b8-6dfe7db43444
5,methods5," The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score is based on 12 questions on food items (frequency consumption of food groups by using raw data, mean daily intake of vegetable oil and animal fat) and 2 questions on food intake habits characteristic of the Mediterranean diet.  Each item was scored with a 0 (condition not met) or a 1 (adherent); thus, the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score ranged from 0 to 14 points (Appendix A Table A1). The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores of the participants were then transformed into tertiles, resulting in three equally sized groups as ”low”, “medium”, and “high”.  2.4. Chronotype  Individual sleeping habits were ascertained based on the “Munich Chronotype Questionnaire” [20]. The chronotype was calculated for work-free days. Exclusion criteria were the use of alarm clock, dependent sleep cycle (due to, e.g.",b1dafad8-4e82-4f71-90a9-6044bd5c59ea
6,methods6,", care for family members), implausible total sleep duration of fewer than 3 h or more than 15 h, or missing values in sleep onset or wake-up time. Due to quality assurance measures, implausible values (n = 100) were corrected, e.g., if persons obviously mixed up the 24-h system and time in a.m./p.m. “Normal” chronotypes had rounded to half an hour mid-sleeps between 04:00 and 04:30, early between 03:30 and 23:00, and late between 05:00 and 10:00.  2.5. Covariates  To assess physical activity, participants completed the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Physical Activity Questionnaire (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-PAQ) [21]. The activity was assessed separately for summer and winter. Time was cumulated and divided by two to receive a proxy for the year’s weekly average in total. This was transferred into a variable dichotomizing equal to or more than 1 h/week (reference) and less than 1 h/week.",ac06ca40-5299-426c-a5dc-78e86b075b7d
7,methods7,"  The smoking status was queried during the anamnesis at the study center. The analysis included smoking status using three levels: never smoker, ex-smoker for at least six months, and current smoker.  As a proxy for socioeconomic status, the highest level of school-leaving qualification was included in data analysis (divided into three groups “high”, “medium,” and “low”).  2.6. Statistical Analyses  Binary logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors of the independent variables age, sex, sport, educational level, smoking status, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet to the dependent outcome variable: MetS (risk estimates with a 95% confidence interval). Each variable in the regression model was tested for interaction. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using R 3.6.2 (R Development Core Team, Auckland, New Zealand).  3. Results  3.1.",26c0c89d-9860-404c-898a-c110cadd9fbd
8,methods8," Study Sample  The final sample size consisted of n = 3513 complete-case participants. In Table 2, the characteristics of the participants are shown (women: 50.4%, men: 49.6%). The average age was 61.4 years (SD 6.8, range 50 to 74). Men reported more often a high education level (“high”) according to their school diploma (high education: 48.3% in women, 58.5% in men). Women and men almost equally often were “current-smoker,” but women reported more often to be “never-smoker” (women: 40.1% vs. men: 33.7%).  More women were categorized as “normal” chronotype (women: 45.6% vs. men: 42.5%). Men more often showed a “late” chronotype (women 25.4% vs. men 29.0%).  On average, women had a higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. Men were twice as often assigned, the “low” category of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score tertile as women. The same trends applied to the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score.",29bf0a5b-6843-4d67-aa2c-e00e59ab2ec4
9,methods9,"  Participants classified as an “early” chronotype showed the lowest daily calorie intake, and persons categorized as “late” chronotype the highest (see Table 3). “Late” chronotype participants showed a statistically significant lower Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score than the other two chronotype groups. “Late” chronotype also received a “high” Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score less often. This was not observed for the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score.  Women were more often adipose according to the measured waist circumference (women: 73.9% vs. men: 69.2%, see Table 4). Men had worse metabolic index parameters, apart from the reduced HDL, which showed no sex difference. MetS (International Diabetes Federation (IDF)) showed 28.2% of women and 44.2% of men.  3.2. Results of Logistic Regression Analyses  Table 5 shows the logistic regression model results, including all 3513 participants.",18498fe1-52b7-44ae-9f16-2ee951369393
10,methods10," Risk factors for MetS were higher age, male sex, less than 1 h of sport per week, and not having a “high” school diploma. Having a “low” Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was a statistically significant risk factor (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.01–1.48). Low and medium Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) scores were risk factors, but none of the odds ratios statistically reached significance. Only for “late” chronotype, a slightly elevated OR (1.06) was found, but no statistically significant effect on the outcome MetS, but improved the model.  Figure 1 displays the test for possible interaction between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and chronotype. Whereas within the “low” Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score category, a trend of increasing risk of MetS from normal via early to late chronotype can be observed, the categories of high and moderate adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet showed no trend.  4.",c8adb204-345a-4e74-938a-c5cca97a0a48
11,methods11," Discussion  In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the association between chronotype, dietary quality, and the prevalence of the MetS in an elderly population-based cohort, considering age, sex, education, and further relevant lifestyle factors. Overall, we found that women had a higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, whereas men were twice as often assigned the “low” Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) category. The same was found in an analysis of periodontitis [22]. Higher adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) diet was associated with less conventional cardiovascular risk factors and the prevalence of MetS. Participants assigned to the “late” chronotype were more often characterized by higher energy intake and a lower Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score.",16d89d62-5146-43f6-9634-930bd440a2f9
12,methods12," In a logistic regression analysis, age, male sex, less than 1 h of sport per week, not having a high school diploma, and being categorized to the low Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score were independent risk factors for the MetS, while the chronotype vastly improved the model but failed to show significance.  In this elderly population from the Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) study, the prevalence of MetS was higher in men than women (men: 44.2% vs. women: 28.2%, see Table 4). Our observation that males were particularly characterized by a cluster of metabolic risk factors, including higher blood pressure values, impaired glucose metabolism, and raised triglycerides is consistent with German nationwide research [4,5]. However, more women than men presented with central obesity despite lower mean BMI. This finding can be explained predominantly by hormonal and metabolic changes that occur during the menopause transition.",321287e7-7046-4490-a389-bf6b7f7fd473
13,methods13," Actually, estrogen loss adversely alters body fat distribution, cholesterol profile, blood pressure, and increased insulin resistance [23].  Central obesity independent of BMI is the key factor in the development of MetS. Besides hereditable determinants, modifying lifestyle factors such as dietary habits, physical activity, and to a certain extent, smoking status, remain the major driving force [24]). Overall, elderly women in Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) followed a favorable lifestyle compared to men. Significantly more women described themselves as never smokers, as physically active (≥1 h sports/week), and reported higher adherence to both healthy dietary patterns, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). More than twice as many women as men were assigned to the highest tertile of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score.",2faac3ea-d827-427d-a140-88c9531689a4
14,methods14," Sex-specific differences in health behavior, particularly dietary habits and related risk factors, are well-known among adult populations [25,26]. Although mean adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was underparts (4.48 of 10) in the study population, it was significantly higher in the older age group (65–74 yr) compared to younger participants (50–64 yr). A healthier food choice with increasing age has been described elsewhere [27].  As expected from previous research, adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet seemed to be cardio-protective [7,23]. The prevalence of conventional cardiovascular risk factors was slightly but significantly lower in the highest tertile compared to the lowest. This includes central obesity (68.6% vs. 71.6%), elevated blood pressure (56% vs. 64.9%), diabetes (21.7% vs. 29.6%), raised triglycerides (16.4% vs. 28%) and low HDL-cholesterol (8.1% vs. 13.4%).",ab25ac05-c43d-4f0d-afbd-97eba5e22502
15,methods15," The same trend applied to the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) diet. Consequently, high adherence to both diets was associated with a lower prevalence of MetS (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH): 29.6% vs. 42.1%; Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS): 29.2% vs. 41.7%).  In this analysis, individual chronotype was referable for 3513 participants (women: n = 1772; men: 1741). Chronotype was classified as “normal” in 44.1% of the participants, “early” in 28.8%, and “late” in 27.2%. Almost equally in men and women, one-third was classified as “early” chronotype (28.5% vs. 29.0%). More men than women were classified as “late” chronotype (men: 29.0% vs. women: 25.4%). This finding is consistent with a meta-analysis of Randler and Engelke (2019), which included 164 studies. Randler and Engelke also observed that gender differences diminish with age, but still, older women were less often early chronotype than older men [28]—a result not found in our sample.",80a12eff-12c8-4f69-b24d-fa88bed676d2
16,methods16,"  Growing evidence indicates the contribution of chronotype to central obesity [24]. A scoping review of Mazri et al. (2020) concluded that the late chronotype is associated with a delay in meal timing, skipping breakfast, and more meals during nighttime, together with higher consumption of sweets, caffeine, and alcohol [13]. Morning and evening types were relatively alike in consuming carbohydrates, fat, cholesterol, fiber, legumes, meat, fish, or dairy products. Chronotype has often been linked to dietary intake. Individuals with “late” chronotype particularly follow an unhealthier dietary behavior [10,13,23,29]. These studies are largely supportive of our findings. Participants classified as “late” chronotypes showed the highest energy intake, statistically significant, compared to those with a “normal” chronotype.",8defef92-1a21-40a2-b795-487b56602a9a
17,methods17," Additionally, “late” chronotypes belong less often to the higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score category and were characterized by a significantly lower Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score in contrast to the other two chronotypes. Differences between chronotype and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score failed to show significance. The lack of association is likely due to the overall low adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score (mean: 4.54 points out of max possible 14 points) in this aging, non-Mediterranean population. For example, less than 5% of the participants fulfilled key diet components, such as the intake of olive oil, fish/seafood, red meat and pulses. Thus, even those in the highest tertile did not eat in accordance with the recommendations.  Depending on the completeness of data to classify chronotype, 3513 participants were included in the multiple logistic regression model.",b07f343d-6e5a-4a19-8fc0-becf2d4764fb
18,methods18," As expected being male (OR = 1.93; 95% CI 1.93–2.25), 65 years or older (OR = 1.54; 95% CI 1.32–1.79) and a low educational level (OR = 2.04; 95% CI 1.68–2.49) stand for statistically significant elevated risks for MetS.  Physical activity is known to be important in the prevention and as an intervention for MetS [6,30]. According to this, our analysis showed “less than 1 h of sport per week” as a risk factor (OR = 1.55; 95% CI 1.32–1.81).  Less impact was found for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet in this elderly cohort. Only for participants with low adherence, the elevated risk of MetS became statistically significant (OR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.01–1.48). In a review of Filippou et al. (2020), it was found that in trials investigating the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet with mean age < 50-years, blood pressure was reduced more, so our findings are plausible in this context [31].",1e813e31-6e01-4cfe-a784-8dd0fca86d5c
19,methods19,"  Chronotype was not directly associated with MetS, neither “early” nor “late.” A slightly elevated OR (1.06) was observed for late chronotype but not statistically significant. That was why we tested for a possible interaction between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and chronotype (Figure 1). For participants with low adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, a trend of an increasing predicted probability from early to late chronotype was found. Such a trend was not clear in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) categories with medium or high scores. It might be concluded that a combination of late chronotype and low Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score possibly increased the risk of developing a MetS.",eb7fb7f8-7a26-41a5-b3ce-c887c7df1bb0
20,methods20,"  Our findings will add to the limited number of studies investigating the association between chronotype, dietary quality, and MetS in an elderly population-based cohort, considering age, sex, and education as well as physical activity and smoking status. Chronotype and dietary and lifestyle habits were assessed by validated methods/instruments. However, a cross-sectional design can not reveal causality, and information on chronotype, diet, and lifestyle behavior were based only on self-reported data. In this data analysis based on the first 10,000 participants, health-conscious individuals were more likely to participate in the investigation, which we observed referring to the level of education and proportion of current smokers or adipose persons [32], respectively. Therefore, reporting and selection bias can not be excluded.  5. Conclusions  In total, the data showed that in Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS), known risk factors for MetS are confirmed.",4e520745-3a92-49f8-92d9-b749e3685d7c
21,methods21," However, lifestyle factors like smoking or lack of exercise are contributing less than low education.  Participants of this northern German Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) cohort investigated here are quite similar in diet adherence related to the prevention of hypertension. Men and women score close around four underparts with a small standard deviation for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence. But only those attributed to the lowest tertile of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score we observed to be at risk of MetS. Within this group, late chronotype was found to be an unfavorable condition.  Future research should focus on options for prevention in persons with late chronotype, so they can be supported better in adherence to, e.g., Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet to lower their risk.
