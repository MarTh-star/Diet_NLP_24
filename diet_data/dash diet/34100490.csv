0,background0," Some dietary patterns may improve diabetes complications through scavenging oxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. This study evaluated the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) diet on sleep status, mental health, and hormonal changes among Iranian women with type 2 diabetes.

1,methods1," Based on this formula, 30 subjects were needed in each group to have adequate power. However, because of dropout, we continued the sampling process to 33 in each group.  Inclusion criteria were as follows: postmenopausal women with T2DM, willing to participate in the trial, history of taking a stabilized dose of oral antidiabetic medication, and no history of taking supplements within 3 months. The exclusion criteria were any change in medical treatments during the trial and if participants did not return to the clinic for follow-up visits. Also, patients who were receiving medical treatment, including antiobesity, anti-inflammatory, or antipsychotics, insulin therapy, hormone therapy, having other clinical diseases such as type 1 diabetes, liver and kidney damage, asthma, malignancy and cancers, gastrointestinal diseases, food allergy, hormonal disorders, pancreatitis, and thyroid dysfunction, were not included in this study.",64eabdd3-2cd0-4800-a0c7-d30e850654ce
2,methods2," All the patients declared their participation in the project by providing a written informed consent.  After the screening procedure, we used the permuted block randomization method to allocate subjects into the 2 groups (the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or control diet; 33 patients in each group). For matching patients, we used stratified randomization based on body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) (normal, overweight, and obese). Hence, the intervention was a diet therapy and we could not perform a concealing procedure. Although participants were not blind to treatment, the laboratory assessors were blinded to group allocation and study hypothesis.  A questionnaire was used for sociodemographic information. Subjects were required to record their 3-day physical activity (PA) every 2 weeks seven times. Finally, PA levels were expressed by the metabolic equivalent hour per day (MET-h/day) (29).",7fdcd282-881c-4000-a2b8-c3ee4e677aea
3,methods3,"  Dietary Intervention  The intervention group (33 patients) received the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the other 33 patients received a control diet for 3 months. Both the diets included a macronutrient composition of 50–55% carbohydrates, 15–20% protein, and 30% total fat. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was rich in whole grains, low-fat dairy products, vegetables, and fruits. It was low in sweets, refined grains, total fat, cholesterol, and saturated fat. The control diet presented as a usual diet with no recommendation for increasing consumption of whole grains, fish, and nuts, as well as no recommendation for fat intakes restriction. The control group consumed less serving of nuts, whole grains, low-fat dairy, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains compared to the intervention group.",363ec76c-67d9-4768-bbca-3dee0df0f058
4,methods4," Table 1 presents serving sizes of the daily food groups and the main differences between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and control diets based on a 2,000-kcal diet. The amount of sodium was no more than 2,400 mg per day. The prescribed calorie was the same for both the groups. Each intervention group received a list of approved foods with a 7-day menu, as well as an exchange list to ensure diversity of food consumption. We checked the compliance of subjects as follows:  Dietary records. All the participants were asked to provide seven 3-day food records (every 2 weeks during the trial), which consisted of serving sizes of consumed foods with ingredients. Household measures were used to obtain grams of food consumed (30). Nutritionist IV, which is adapted for Iranian foods, was used to perform nutrient analysis (First Databank Division, The Corporation, San Bruno, California, USA).

We asked patients in both the groups to sustain their physical activity during this study, which was confirmed through weekly phone calls and reviewing the patients seven 3-day physical activity records.  Assessment of Anthropometric Measures  All the anthropometric measurements were measured at the beginning and end of the trial. Weight was recorded in minimally clothed participants and without footwear using a calibrated digital scale (SECA 803, Germany).",5c4e1dd8-256b-41b3-b742-7c758aef94ad
6,methods6," Height was measured in a standing position by using an upstretched tape measure, while shoulders were in the normal position. body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2). Waist circumference (WC) was measured at the narrowest part of the waist between the last rib and the iliac crest over light clothing, using an unscratched anthropometric tape to the nearest 0.1 cm.  Assessment of Biochemical Tests  Blood samples (10 ml of venous blood) were collected at the beginning and end of this study after a 12-h overnight fasting to determine serum levels of fasting blood sugar (fasting blood sugar (FBS)), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)), and vitamin C. Serum samples were separated after centrifuging at 3,000 rpm for 20 min and stored at −80°C.",6c10a4fd-b77f-4a4e-9582-24314c431463
7,methods7," However, fasting blood sugar (FBS) was measured on the day of blood collection by enzymatic colorimetric method using glucose oxidase. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured using the immunoturbidimetric assay in whole blood. ELISA kits were used for measuring AGEs (Crystal day, China), testosterone (PadtanGostar Isar, Iran), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (DiaMetra, Italy), LH (Pishtaz Teb, Iran), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) (Pishtaz Teb, Iran), and vitamin C (Crystal day, China).  Assessment of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress  The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 items (DASS-21) was used to assess psychological symptoms (31). This self-reported scale has three subscales (contain 7 questions for each subscale), including depression, anxiety, and stress, which were assessed through 21 questions. Each question was scored from 0 to 3 and scores from each subscale were summed.",b8075925-bb1c-44c1-b38e-9a9916c93bab
8,methods8," For depression, a total score of zero to 9 is normal, whereas scores above 10 relate to increasing severity of depression (mild to extremely severe). For anxiety, a total score of zero to 7 is normal and scores above 8 relate to increasing severity of anxiety (mild to extremely severe). For stress, a total score of zero to 14 is normal, whereas scores 15 and above relate to increasing severity of stress (mild to extremely severe). Finally, each subject was classified into either normal or abnormal levels of psychological disorders.  Assessment of Sleep Duration  Participant sleep duration was extracted from sociodemographic information. Moreover, all the participants were asked to complete the validated self-report Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) (32).",0f395f95-03f6-417b-9a65-4500ddbf8ef1
9,methods9," The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) measures the pattern and quality of sleep over the past month and consists of 9 items that explain sleep latency, duration, and efficiency, using sleep medication, sleep disturbances, and daytime dysfunction. These items differentiate poor to good value with a range of 0 to 3 (0, not in the past month; 1, less than once per week; 2, once or twice per week; and 3, three or more times per week). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scales by a total score of 0 to 21. A score of 5 and above suggests poor sleep quality.  Statistical Analysis  All the statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version 16.0; SPSS Incorporation, Chicago, Illinois, USA). The normality of data distribution was assessed by using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and also histogram curve.",7b03ab4f-0de4-4a6d-b22e-aa529596baed
10,methods10," Independent sample t-test was used for determining mean differences between the groups for continuous variables such as age, weight, and body mass index. The chi-squared test was used to determine the distribution of categorical variables between the intervention and control groups. The between-group analysis was determined using repeated measure analysis of covariance (analysis was determined using repeated measure analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)). Adjustments were conducted for baseline values, age, protein intake, socioeconomic status, weight reduction, triglyceride changes, and blood glucose changes in different models. P < .05 was considered as statistically significant. ",db2367c9-827d-47d6-b2e4-1536d309845e
11,results0," Data from 66 participants were analyzed and included in the intention-to-treat analysis (n = 66). Therefore, based on recruiting 33 per group rather than 30 per group, the attrition rate was 10%. Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of the trial in this study. Three individuals in the intervention group and 3 individuals in the control group failed to complete the trial. Three subjects in the control group did not desire to complete the trial. In the intervention group, one participant did not desire to finish the trial, 1 participant had a car accident, which led to an inflammatory condition, and 1 participant was excluded due to shifting their medication therapy to insulin therapy. Baseline characteristics in each group are shown in Table 2. The mean age of patients in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (57.52 ± 4.99 years) was significantly lower than the control group (60.70 ± 6.33 years) (P =0.027).",f41ff2aa-8097-4946-8f11-cc424224e3cd

As previously shown in Table 1, the intervention group was recommended to consume more vegetables, fruits, grains, especially whole grains and nuts, and to consume lower red and processed meat and fats rather than the control group.",aec310e6-0331-4783-8fd7-033e10861218
13,results2," These recommendations were applied to find the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on primary and secondary outcomes and as shown in Table 3, there was significant difference between the consumed food groups by the intervention and control groups. Dietary intakes of participants during the 3-month intervention period are shown in Table 3. Energy, carbohydrate, and total fat intakes were not significantly different among the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the control group (P ≥.05). The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet group consumed more potassium (the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet: 4272.53 ± 210.39 mg vs. the control group: 2355.98 ± 267.03 mg), fiber (the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet: 26.14 ± 2.66 g vs. the control group: 14.61 ± 3.47 g), and vitamin C (the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet: 261.01 ± 53.37 mg vs. the control group: 90.62 ± 35.",b0592759-bf45-4e94-92d8-6d21317243af

19,discussion0," In this study, we examined the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on sleep and psychological status in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet had a beneficial effect on depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as sleep status in type 2 diabetic patients. In a cross-sectional study, Valipour et al. showed that moderate adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was negatively associated with depression (33). In this recent cross-sectional study in women with diabetes, patients who adhered to the animal-based dietary patterns were more likely to be poor sleepers or had components of depression, stress, and anxiety (34).  The high antioxidant capacity of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet leads to reduced oxidative stress, which is related to decreased insulin resistance (35).",fd0dfd01-291e-4e72-823a-b3dade8a1a95
20,discussion1," Moreover, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet can improve insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss (36). Oxidative stress and inflammation play a role in initiating psychological disorders via altering brain functions (37). The high antioxidant capacity of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet through consumption of the food groups such as legumes, nuts, vegetables, and fruits can reduce inflammation and oxidative stress and improve brain functioning by affecting synaptic plasticity (38). Healthful-rich plant foods were associated with improved psychological disorders among Iranian women (39). Beezhold et al. showed that a reduction of animal foods and higher consumption of plant-based foods may have beneficial effects on mental health (40). A clinical trial on 75 Iranian women revealed that consumption of high-fiber diets, especially high in whole grains, can improve levels of inflammatory factors and prevent subsequent health outcomes (41).",dc5dc32f-0baf-4520-826f-00e1b0791da7
21,discussion2,"  Vegetables consumed in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet are good sources of folate and magnesium. These micronutrients play a role in the synthesis of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, and may contribute to brain reactions, as well as anti-inflammatory effects (42, 43). Moreover, vitamin D as one of the important ingredients in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet can improve mood status. A randomized controlled trial of women with T2DM, anxiety, and vitamin D deficiency revealed that vitamin D supplementation for 16 weeks improved mood status (44).  Nuts and beans are the other important foods in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which have beneficial effects through several mechanisms such as ameliorating insulin resistance and improving postmenopausal symptoms.",1226281e-358e-45f6-b61b-91adf9524794
22,discussion3," A controlled-feeding study of 50 patients with T2DM showed that daily consumption of cashews for 8 weeks reduced serum insulin (45). In addition, soybeans can promote the expression of estrogen-sensitive genes by binding to estrogen receptors and can reduce hot flashes in postmenopausal women (46). Also, it is well established that sex steroid hormones impact mental health status and mood through neuroprotective and neurodevelopmental processes (47). A cross-sectional study in China found that nut consumption was inversely associated with depression (48). In a large population study of Iranian adults, legumes and nuts consumption were inversely associated with anxiety in adult men. However, there was no significant association between nuts and legumes and anxiety in women. Furthermore, the depressive symptoms were assessed by hospital anxiety and depression scales, not by the DASS-21 (49).",f618843d-5f85-4d56-8e9b-04503a016c14
23,discussion4," Legumes and nuts are high in magnesium content, which is a key nutrient in many brain reactions and metabolism of neurotransmitters. Moreover, they contain fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, folic acid, and other B vitamins, which may have beneficial effects on mood and mental health status (42, 50).  On the other hand, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet had beneficial effects on anthropometric indices in this study. In line with our results, Fatahi et al. showed that weight-loss diets rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables reduced body weight and waist circumference (51). A cross-sectional study in 3,004 adult women showed that anxiety and depression may be related to weight gain (52). However, it should be noted that even after controlling for weight loss, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet significantly reduced depressive symptoms and sleep status scores.",115fe1a1-1293-4ec7-9e71-37f69ce4772a
24,discussion5,"  To the best of our knowledge, there is no study examining the relationship between the adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and AGEs. AGEs can be obtained through dietary intakes or can be produced by various reactions such as oxidation of amino acids, lipids, and sugars. AGEs can be generated by oxidative stress even without hyperglycemia. AGEs predispose individuals to inflammation and oxidative stress, which are related to insulin resistance and diabetes and many other chronic diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, sleep apnea, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes (53). In this study, the levels of serum AGEs in the patients who adhered to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet were significantly lower compared to the control group. It was hypothesized that antioxidant capacity of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may improve the serum AGEs level.",e658a0b5-2fcf-4696-a305-c863337e2059
25,discussion6," A 3-month calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet in 47 women with overweight and obesity showed a significant reduction in AGEs and insulin resistance (54). Increased intake of antioxidant foods, including vegetables, fruits, nuts, and whole grains and lower intake of red and processed meats, pastries, and sweetened beverages, led to lower intake of AGEs in the Mediterranean diet and may apply to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (54).  This study was the first comprehensive study to examining the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on several diabetes-related outcomes such as depression, anxiety, stress, sleep status, and the levels of selected sex hormones. However, there are several limitations that should be noted. The reverse causation between diabetes and psychological disorders is unknown. The results are not generalizable to other populations of different ages and gender.",f077b0ac-ef3b-4fcd-a637-6797de98f437
26,discussion7," Moreover, we did not measure dietary, urinary, or fecal AGEs. Therefore, future studies examining the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or other healthy dietary patterns should include a comprehensive assessment of AGEs.  Conclusion  In conclusion, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet improved the biochemical markers in the intervention group and had beneficial effects on depression, anxiety, and stress scores, as well as sleep status. Further studies are suggested to confirm our results.
