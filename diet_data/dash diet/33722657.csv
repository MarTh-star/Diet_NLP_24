0,methods0," Among 254 cases and 633 controls in a hospital-based case–control study in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China, dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH), alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), and Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI) were calculated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Asthenotetrazoospermia was evaluated according to World Health Organization guidelines. Unconditional multiple logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between quality diet scores and asthenoteratozoospermia risk.   Design and Population  The present hospital-based case–control study was conducted to compare the diet quality scores of men with and without asthenoteratozoospermia. Study participants were men referred to the infertility clinic of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from June 2020 to December 2020.",cc9f6581-f82d-410a-8d6a-d512c1959373
1,methods1," As shown in Figure 1, a reproductive medicine specialist diagnosed each man with asthenoteratozoospermia as a new patient (incident case) and was placed in the case group (n = 267) based on the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen (fifth edition, 2010) (1). Asthenoteratozoospermia is defined as the concentration and proportions of motile and morphologically normal spermatozoa below the reference values (<15 × 106 sperm/mL, <32% progressive motility, and <4% normal morphology) (1). Men with normozoospermia (n = 662) were selected as the control group and were companions of patients admitted to the same infertility clinic. Trained research interviewers administered a baseline questionnaire that included sociodemographic and dietary history for recruited men.",96000fbf-1ae2-4540-814c-ea6e8d4a0f2a
2,methods2," Patients who had missing individual information or an invalid food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) were not eligible for recruitment, nor were patients with unreasonable intake of energy (<800 or >4,200 kcal/d). Two hundred fifty-four cases with asthenoteratozoospermia and 633 controls were included in the final analysis.  Figure 1 Flow chart of participants.  Ethical and research approvals were obtained from the ethics committee of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, with all participants providing written consent at study enrollment.  Semen Collection and Analysis  For 3–7 days of celibate, semen samples were collected without using condoms or lubricants through masturbation into a plastic tube in a dedicated room. Samples were liquefied for 60 min before analysis. Ejaculate volume, pH, sperm concentration, total count of sperm inspected, total motility, and the percentage of each motile grade of sperm were measured with WLJY9000.",213225bf-7023-4a75-bf9c-f93f7d9b930c
3,methods3," Flow cytometry was used to assess sperm DNA fragmentation and sperm DNA staining. After pasteurization, sperm smears were observed under an optical microscope and evaluated for morphology. The reference values of normal sperm were determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (15). External quality was controlled by experienced technicians.  Data Collection  All participants were asked to complete a self-administered, semiquantitative validated food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) that included 110 food items: they were asked how often, on average, during the previous year they had consumed each food. Estimations of energy and nutrient intakes were performed with the aid of the Chinese Food Composition Tables (16). In addition, demographic characteristics (age, education level, and household income), lifestyle (smoking, drinking, and physical activity), and other information were collected by a questionnaire.",782f3dab-0d5d-43d5-ab7c-46d843447a0d
4,methods4," The heights and weights were collected by physical examination. After obtaining these measurements, the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was taken for each participant by dividing weight (kg) by height squared (m2).  Diet Quality Scores  We assessed 3 diet quality scores, and details are presented in Supplementary Table 1. The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score includes eight components: fruits, vegetables, nuts/legumes, dairy, whole grains, red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and sodium intake, which range from 8 to 40 (17). The alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010 score is based on vegetables (excluding potatoes), fruits, whole grains, nuts and legumes, long-chain n-3 fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, sweetened beverages and juice, red and processed meat, trans fat, sodium, and alcoholic drinks, which range from 1 to 110 (18).",ddef606b-3a4a-41c4-97ce-77e4958624a9
5,methods5," The Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI) score is calculated according to 12 adequacy components (total grains, whole grains and mixed beans, tubers, total vegetables, dark vegetables, fruits, dairy, soybeans, fish and seafood, seeds and nuts, poultry, and eggs) and 5 moderation components (red meat, cooking oils, sodium, added sugars, and alcohol), which range from 0 to 100 (14).  Statistical Analysis  Descriptive statistics were examined for all variables. Continuous variables are reported as the mean ± standard deviation; categorical variables are presented as numbers of participants and percentages. We conducted Student's t-tests or chi-square-tests to compare differences between groups. We created tertiles of each diet score and used unconditional logistic regression analyses to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess associations between quality scores and asthenoteratozoospermia risk.",310182e5-fb94-45eb-8ba9-890a0b6f15f0
6,methods6," The lowest tertile of scores was considered the reference group. A linear trend was tested by treating the median value of each tertile as a continuous variable. In addition, we alternatively assessed the risk estimates associated with a continuous measure for a 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in scores. We used three models: model 1 (adjusted for energy and age) and model 2 (adjusted for energy, age, smoking status, drinking status, household income, education level, abstinence time, and physical activity). We conducted adjusted risk estimates for asthenoteratozoospermia by Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI), alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010 and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) scores in subgroup analyses stratified by age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status.  All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.3, for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). All reported P-values are two-sided, and those that were <0.",6b7ccbab-1f39-4479-924c-5b5d01a2cd99

8,results2,"  General characteristics of participants according to tertiles of Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI), dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH), and alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010 scores are presented in Supplementary Tables 2–4. Semen parameters, progress motility, and total motility were all increased across tertiles for Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI), alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010, and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) scores (P < 0.05). Participants with a high score of these three diet patterns were more likely to be younger, consume less energy and have a smoking and drinking history (P < 0.05).

Association of Diet Quality With Asthenoteratozoospermia Risk  The relationships between diet quality scores and asthenoteratozoospermia risk are presented in Table 2. The Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI) score was inversely associated with the risk of asthenoteratozoospermia in the age- and total energy-adjusted model (T3 vs. T1, OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.36–0.79, P trend < 0.01) as well as in the multivariate adjusted model (T3 vs. T1, OR = 0.",626429c6-ca77-4639-924f-9c9aa4493283
10,results6," We found that these diet quality scores were significantly associated with the decreased risk of asthenoteratozoospermia by 22% (95% CI, 9–33%) for per 1 SD increase in Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI) score, 17% (95% CI, 2–29%) for per 1 SD increase in alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) score, and 21% (95% CI, 6–33%) for per 1 SD increase in dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score.  Stratified Analyses  As shown in Table 3, we found that there were significant interactive effects of age and smoking status on the associations (all P for interaction < 0.05). For these scores, significant reverse associations were only witnessed in younger patients (T3 vs. T1, OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.28–0.77 for Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI); OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.31–0.84, P trend < 0.05 for alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010; OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.33–0.88, P trend < 0.05 for dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)).",d1bc91d6-8539-458f-a699-e581d0a634bf

12,discussion0," In the current study, we found that the inverse association between diet quality scores and asthenoteratozoospermia risk was evident for Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI), alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010 and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) scores overall, when the SD of diet quality scores was considered a continuous variable. In the stratified analyses, significant inverse associations for these three diet scores only appeared for individuals at a younger age.  There has been no study investigating the association between multiple diet quality scores and asthenoteratozoospermia risk. We found that higher adherence to the alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010 and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) scores was inversely associated with asthenoteratozoospermia risk.",416004f7-f87e-4692-ae98-42ef0c920bf7
13,discussion1," Our results are partially consistent with a cross-sectional study conducted in Poland that reported that adherence to alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010 and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) scores may have higher sperm concentration, normal sperm morphology, and total sperm count (12). Some similarities may also be found with observations conducted in Israel reporting that men in the highest quartiles of alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010 and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) scores had significantly higher sperm concentrations and normal sperm morphology (1).  The alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010 and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) scores were characterized by high intakes of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes and low intakes of sugar-sweetened, red/processed meat, and sodium.",815c2874-6c72-4c47-9b52-fef9ad805948
14,discussion2," These high intake food groups were found to be positively associated with sperm count (3, 19), concentration (19), sperm motility (20, 21), and morphology (3, 19). These food groups serve as major sources of vitamins, minerals, and polyphenols, which are be considered antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. The antioxidants in male reproductive health may be positively associated with semen parameters (22–24), as these oxidants may reduce oxidative damage to sperm (25, 26), DNA maintenance, transfer RNA, and protein synthesis (27), and reduce the negative effects of inflammation (26, 28). Moreover, these two dietary scores recommend reduction in sugar-sweetened beverage, red/processed meat, and fat consumption. The relatively high content of sugars, saturated/trans fatty acids, and sodium may adversely affect sperm count (19), concentration (29, 30), sperm motility (3, 20), and morphology (3, 31).",9fc9aea8-5100-4ab9-b933-7b056c15d01e
15,discussion3,"  In addition, we found that Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI) scores were inversely associated with asthenoteratozoospermia risk. As the instrument in China to assess diet quality overall, the Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI) score was developed according to the updated Dietary Guidelines for Chinese (14). The main components recommended by the Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI) score are higher intakes of total grains, whole grains, and mixed beans, tubers, total vegetables, dark vegetables, fruits, dairy, soybeans, fish and seafood, poultry, eggs, seeds, and nuts and limitation of red meat, cooking oils, sodium, added sugars and alcohol (14). Evidence from epidemiological studies has reported that high intakes of dairy (4), fruits and vegetables (19, 32), cereals (32), fish (5, 6), nuts (6), and eggs (6) were related to higher sperm quality.",ca0187a7-40d5-49cf-9a8f-6e773f1bf1c7
16,discussion4," In addition, high consumption of red meat (6, 32), processed meat (5), habitual alcohol consumption (33), sugar-sweetened beverages (34), and fish was found to be associated with low semen quality. The apparent benefit of Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI) may be attributable to a high intake of foods containing antioxidants and carotenoids. Reactive oxygen species production has been associated with increased cellular damage and the rate of sperm ATP depletion, which leads to insufficient axonemal phosphorylation, lipid peroxidation, and loss of motility and viability (35). In addition, the Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI) pattern also contains a high amount of nutrients with good anti-inflammatory properties, such as omega-3 fatty acids, fruit, and vegetables, and a low amount of proinflammatory nutrients, such as red meat and unhealthy fat.",32eacf59-eef0-4259-8e15-b1b31bf7660e
17,discussion5," Inflammation may affect reproduction through anatomical or functional changes in the male accessory gland and/or direct negative impacts on spermatozoa (28).  In the stratified analyses, we found that the favorable associations between the three diet quality scores and asthenoteratozoospermia risk persisted across participants whose age was below 32 years, which indicated that adhering to the latest dietary guidelines for Americans or Chinese individuals is more likely to decrease asthenoteratozoospermia risk for young participants. The reason may be that young participants often show less healthy eating habits than general participants (36, 37). In addition, smoking can have a harmful effect on semen quality through a variety of toxic substances and chemical substances (38).",233b133f-671f-4d0f-ab08-3621be5e1b73
18,discussion6," However, the beneficial substances produced by diet cannot compensate for the harm to semen quality caused by smoking, which may explain the negative correlations between the Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI) score and asthenoteratozoospermia risk in non-smokers.  Our study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the association between Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI), alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010, and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) and the risk of asthenoteratozoospermia in a Chinese population. Furthermore, we not only adjusted for several confounding factors but also carried out numerous subgroup analyses, which ensured the authenticity and reliability of our research results. However, some limitations occurred in our study. First, we cannot exclude the possibility of reverse causality with a case–control design.",54d70ebd-b299-4066-b8ad-678e1262ae6e
19,discussion7," However, we provided strong evidence of a positive association by eliminating the effect of potential confounders. Second, dietary information collected by the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) may induce recall bias. To reduce this bias, we used the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), which has acceptable reproducibility and validity, to collect dietary information in a face-to-face manner. Third, there are some dietary components that are not included in the diet score, such as oil and salt, which may affect our results. In the future, we need to consider these factors to improve these studies.  Our findings suggested that higher adherence to the Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI), alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010, and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet quality scores may reduce the risk of asthenoteratozoospermia, especially for younger participants.",0b2b7780-aa3e-424e-8713-263b4adf71cd
