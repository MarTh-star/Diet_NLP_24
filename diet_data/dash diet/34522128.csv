3,methods2," Future studies should evaluate prospectively the effect of Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND)-9 on preventing the onset of dementia in Greek adults.  Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet Greek population aging confirmatory factor analysis nutrition cross-sectional study cognition dementia ==== Body pmcIntroduction  The prevalence of dementia has increased dramatically as life expectancy has extended (1). Cognitive decline, which is the hallmark of dementia, is common in the elderly: nearly 50 million people are living with dementia worldwide, and this number is expected to increase to over 80 million by 2030 (2).  The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive impairment.",21e2398e-d722-40e3-a6a4-a6ad6263d11b
4,methods3," The neuropathology of AD involves complex molecular pathways, including the accumulation of the beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in the brain, cytoskeletal changes due to the hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-associated Tau protein in neurons, oxidative stress and neuroiflammation (3). The neuroinflammatory mechanisms have been associated with immunosenescence and intestinal dysbiosis (4). Despite many years of intensive research, no effective treatment is available, nor proven preventative interventions for the cognitive loss in dementia and AD (2).  Cognitive decline is not an inevitable consequence of aging, and a number of protective modifiable lifestyle factors have been identified to counteract it. Diet is a lifestyle factor that can be changed, and several dietary patterns have been associated in numerous studies (5–11) with a protective effect on cognitive decline and dementia development.",65b44e51-5fa2-480d-998c-933a4d89b969
5,methods4," Increased risk of dementia has been associated with consumption of food high in saturated fat and simple carbohydrates, termed the “Western” diet, while diets high in mono- and poly-unsaturated fats, vegetables, and lean proteins are linked with reduced risk (12). The Mediterranean diet resembles such a protective diet, as it includes a high intake of olive oil, pulses and vegetables, moderate consumption of fish and poultry, a low intake of dairy products, and a limited consumption of red meat and sugar (13). As it is rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory substances, the Mediterranean-style diet has been proposed to confer protection against metabolic syndrome, obesity, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases (14–16).",269bb8be-da0d-4202-af44-9f610d7df96b
6,methods5,"  Morris and his team formulated the Mediterranean-dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND)) diet which is a hybrid of the Mediterranean diet and the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)) diet (10). An increasing number of studies has demonstrated that adherence to the Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet strongly associates with lower AD risk and with a slower decline in brain function (1, 7, 10, 12, 17–19).",8ac2c650-7768-460e-a852-73aaec394f40
7,methods6," The Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet is characterized by the high consumption of 10 plant-based foods, such as berries and green leafy vegetables as well as by the limited intake of unhealthy animal foods and saturated fats (7). Those 10 beneficial dietary components have been associated with the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia, via their antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties (10, 11, 20–22). The Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet may benefit patients with AD by reducing potentially harmful Aβ proteins, via alterations of the gut microbiome composition and the effect of the antioxidants and vitamins (23, 24).",2c5fd8a5-99b9-4d47-b6f2-15736d98b77d
8,methods7," In addition, the Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet limits saturated and trans fats which have been shown to halt Aβ clearance in the brain and their intake has been associated with increased Aβ deposition and higher AD risk (21, 22, 25).  The risk of developing dementia has been linked to anxiety and depression possibly due to the reduced function of neurotransmission pathways during cognitive impairment (26). Susceptibility to anxiety and depression is known to be influenced by the microbiome-gut-brain axis, which is ultimately shaped by diet (16). During dementia's development, depressive and anxiety symptoms that overlap with incremental cognitive impairment can lead to the deterioration of dietary habits affecting diet adherence and hence may result in reverse casuality (22).",e24a72c3-d4de-42d7-bb39-924148350fe8
9,methods8,"  In this study, confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the original the Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet scale's factor structure (construct validity) in relation to the ability to distinguish the Greek elderly population diagnosed with or without dementia.   Study population  The study sample consisted of three groups:  Group A included 115 elderly individuals with cognitive decline and diagnosis of dementia (dementia group).  Group B included 52 participants diagnosed with no cognitive decline (healthy controls).  Group C included 36 participants originating from the general Greek population, at the same age range as Group B, who self-reported as healthy, but were not assessed for their cognitive status by neurologists (second control group).",947fa798-9e3e-4884-b3ff-fd75ac858922
10,methods9,"  Group A and Group B participants have been referred for the first time for cognitive evaluation to the Hellenic Association for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders in Thessaloniki, Greece from January 2021 to April 2022. Standardized neuropsychological testing for the diagnosis of cognitive decline was conducted by neurologists, according to the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD11) (27). For the purposes of this study, the diagnosis of the neuropsychological testing of cognitive decline and dementia was retrieved from the medical records of the participants after their evaluation, and they were grouped in Group A or B according to diagnosis on their cognitive status and the Mini mental state exam (Mini mental state exam (MMSE)) (28).  Group C was included in the study to increase the number of participants and to ensure the variance-covariance matrix of the Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) (29).",ff8ca71c-e37f-4361-9f34-c3f890fb692f

The study was approved by the Bioethics committee of Alzheimer Hellas (64/09-01-2021) and was conducted between January 2021 and April 2022.  Anthropometric measurements  Participants' anthropometric measurements were collected by one trained investigator on the morning of the interview, after fasting for at least 8 h. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm, using a commercial stadiometer (Leicester Height Measure, Invicta Plastics Ltd, Oadby, UK) with the participants barefoot, their shoulders in a relaxed position, their arms hanging freely and their heads in the Frankfort horizontal plane.

Dietary habits  A certified dietitian interviewed the participants regarding their dietary habits with the tool derived based on the Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) scoring matrix published by Morris and colleagues (10) (Supplementary Table 1). The interview were done directly to the participants, in most of the cases with the presence of their caregivers, who assisted them to respond with accuracy.",d15ecc69-02c7-4149-90b9-0902c5deeda6
13,methods12,"  In the original scoring of the Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet, 15 dietary parameters were considered, of them 10 were so-called as brain healthy food groups (green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, olive oil, whole grains, fish not fried, poultry not fried, beans, and wine) and five as brain unhealthy food groups (red meat and meat products, butter and margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets, and fast fried food) (10). Scoring ranged from 0 to 15 (minimal to maximal adherence to the Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet). A value of 0, 0.5, or 1 was assigned for intake of each dietary component based on predefined cut-offs. For olive oil, fish, whole grains, berries, green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, beans, and poultry, a value of 1 was assigned to high intake.",702a950f-f5c0-42f8-9497-777778a67352

For wine, a value of 1 was assigned to moderate intake. The total Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet score was the sum of the 15 component scores. Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet was considered low for scores between 2.5 and 6.5, moderate between 6.5 and 8.5 and high from 8.5 to 15.

17,analysis1," Using AMOS 22, the χ2/df, TLI, CFI and RMSEA Goodness-of-Fit (GFIs) were examined to test whether the model fitted the data well (29). A good model fit is implied when χ2/df <5 and ideally non-significant, TLI > 0.90, CFI, > 0.90 and RMSEA <0.08 (31). We were particularly focused on the TLI, which is relatively unaffected by sample size. Modifications indices were examined to identify the observed variables that deteriorated the GFI of the model. A variable was excluded from the model when it decreased its GFIs and scale alpha reliability and concurrently either did not contribute to discriminate between people with dementia and healthy controls or discriminated them to the opposite direction. Based on this methodology, three models consisted of 15, 11, and 9 variables, respectively, were identified and presented below. The total scale score was computed for the best model.

Future research with larger sample of Greek participants may show the beneficial effect of green leafy vegetables on cognitive function, as they are a rich source of vitamin E, folate, β-carotene, phylloquinone, and lutein, which account for their neuroprotective role (8, 32, 33).",a8c33d8b-6b12-4a3d-a729-05632634f662
37,discussion5," A high intake of berries has been shown to slow the decline in cognitive function; berries are a rich source of anthocyanidins, which have been shown to be transported through the blood-brain barrier to the brain areas of memory and learning processing (9). A number of studies have shown negative correlation between moderate fish consumption and occurrence of AD (34). Fish is high in omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs), which exert protective properties against AD by their ability to reduce oxidative stress, to lower insulin and cholesterol levels and to decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease (34). Nuts have been associated with improved cognition; they contain high levels of polyunsaturated fats and antioxidant polyphenols that can promote neuronal function through additive effects, and regulate cardiovascular risk factors (8).",876b01d8-38ad-44e5-9b3b-4a5019e5ee58
38,discussion6,"  Following a significant adjustment of gender, implying that females had higher scores on DASS-21, our results showed that Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND)-9 accounted for significant variance of DASS-21 and confirmed that people with less depressive and anxiety symptoms have a higher adherence to the Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet. Longitudinal studies have shown that depression and anxiety are risk factors for the development of dementia (26). A recent prospective study in the USA demonstrated that mild anxiety symptoms alone can predict dementia risk (35). Female sex significantly correlates with anxiety and dementia development (35–37). Raparelli et al.",f3c64839-4339-408c-9662-601675359b57
39,discussion7," (2020) showed, by multivariate analysis, that low adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with male sex and perceived stress, but not with disease progression (37). Further studies are required to explore the role of gender, specific personality traits and the emotional status in the development and progression of dementia, and in the application of therapeutic dietary interventions. In addition, our participants with dementia had a significantly higher Body mass index (BMI) than the healthy control group. Previous studies also demonstrated a significant positive association of Body mass index (BMI) and the likehood to develop dementia (38).  Overall, in the present study, after significant adjustments of DASS-21, gender and Mini mental state exam (MMSE) scores, Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND)-9 still accounted for unique variance of absence of dementia.",6a161123-5619-410d-aeeb-745dee38d4f2
40,discussion8," The significant negative correlation between the Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND)-9 and DASS-21 psychometric measures supports the divergent validity of Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND)-9, in agreement with previous studies on the 9 food items (7, 10, 12, 17, 18). Our results suggest that Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diets' components must be considered in relevance to the dietary habits and cultural background of the understudy population. For instance, in Greece and probably in other areas of the Mediterranean basin, where olive oil is the main cooking oil (19) it's beneficial effect on dementia was not observable. Moreover, the overall contribution of olive oil in the diet should be considered.",ac6663c3-467b-4e25-97c8-dd243bd3d5ac
41,discussion9," Thus, the last must be considered as a significant limitation of the Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet tool; our results show that it cannot capture effectively either the dietary habits of the understudy and it's adherence to the guidelines for a healthy diet (39) or the more prominent components of the Greek diet that may relate to dementia. Thus, in order to capture the food items that could be significant for dementia, a food frequency questionnaire relevant for the Greek diet should have been used in parallel to the Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet tool. In addition, our study did not include the education attainment throughout life, which according to the cognitive reserve theory can protect significantly against cognitive decline and is a strong predictor of cognition (40).",b19d73a2-af1a-458c-b523-1941b6d68867
42,discussion10," Another possible limitation of our study is that it is based on the recall of the frequency of consumption of various food components and people with dementia might not be able to recall past information accurately, increasing this way the probability of the recall bias, especially when the caregiver was not present during the interview or was not responsible for the food preparation.  Conclusion  Our findings support the construction validity of the Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet tool after reducing its initial components from 15 to 9 in relation to the ability to distinguish the Greek population with or without dementia.",ae034253-8c15-4c5f-8497-5bc05acddb9f
43,discussion11," Future studies should aim to evaluate prospectively the effect of Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND)-9 on preventing the onset of dementia in Greek adults and probably other Mediterranean populations with similar eating habits. Our study is indicative, that the effectiveness of the Mediterranean dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet in preventing dementia, depends on the consumption of specific functional diet components, also relevant to the eating pattern of the understudy population.
