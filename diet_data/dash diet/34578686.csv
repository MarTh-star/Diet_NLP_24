0,methods0," We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)). Dietary information was obtained from a 24-h dietary recall interview. Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was assessed using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality which was confirmed by the end of 2011. Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine the hazard ratios and 95% CI for the association of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and all-cause mortality with multivariate adjustment.   We selected our study population from the participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which was conducted to assess the nutritional and health status of the US population.",360c2e38-c158-4639-80a6-9787b1b79408
1,methods1," Briefly, data were collected through personal interviews, physical examinations, laboratory tests, and questionnaires (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/surveys.htm). The selection of patients with heart failure is shown in Figure 1. We excluded participants aged ≤ 18 years, with missing information on nutrient intakes and renal function, with unknown history about heart failure, and those who reported no history of heart failure from the 62,160 participants [mean age 36.1 (95% CI 35.6–36.5) years] in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2010. Finally, we included 832 participants with a history of heart failure. Survival status of the study population by the end of 2011 was confirmed according to information from the National Death Index.  Figure 1 Flow diagram displaying the selection of study population.

2,methods2," Our protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan (approval number: CE18312A). Informed consent was provided by all of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants. Dietary information of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants were obtained from a 24-h dietary recall interview, which was conducted in person by trained interviewers (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/measuring_guides_dri/measuringguides.htm). A computer-assisted software program, and measurement aids and visuals including charts and drawings were used to facilitate the 24-h dietary recall interview. Data from the 24-h dietary recall interview were translated for analyses according to the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (https://www.ars.usda.",c7ee03c6-4f3a-463b-a9e7-2e329d6304f6

We used the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (20) to assess the dietary concordance to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. To determine the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, data on 9 target nutrients (Table 1) (20) were obtained based on information from the 24-h dietary recall interview. We determined whether the participants' intake met the goal of each target nutrient. This method has been applied to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) population (21–23). One point was assigned to each target nutrient if the study participants' intake met the goal (20, 23, 24), while half (0.5) a point was assigned if only the intermediate goal was met.",1e9451a8-fd8c-4975-90c2-0584b96b16e2

We used the Statistical Analysis System survey procedures (SAS version 9.4, 2013, Cary, NC, USA) to conduct all of the statistical analyses, which were adequately weighted (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx). We divided the study population into two groups according to their Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (>median vs. ≤ median). Between-group differences in categorical and continuous variables were examined using the Chi-square test and independent t test, respectively. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. We conducted weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models to determine the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI for the association of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (>median vs.",db784277-95d3-40fd-9e81-c262d1366746

Adjusted variables included known factors related to risk of mortality (age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, and eGFR) and dietary factor (daily energy intake). The association was also examined in subgroups of body mass index (≥30 vs. < 30 kg/m2), daily energy intake (≥25 vs. < 25 kcal/kg/day), glucose regulation status (diabetes vs. no diabetes), and renal function (eGFR ≥ 60 vs. < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2). We conducted Cubic spline of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score vs. all-cause mortality risk as a sensitivity test. Finally, the associations of the 9 parts of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (20) with all-cause mortality were determined. A two-sided P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all of the statistical analyses. ",cff605d4-e2a5-473f-ac02-96e69028acf6
6,results0," Table 1 shows the nutrient targets for the 9 parts of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, and the nutrient intakes of the study population. Overall, the study population had suboptimal concordance with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (median Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score = 2). Participants with a higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (>2 vs. ≤ 2, Table 2) had a lower body mass index, a higher systolic blood pressure, and a lower total cholesterol and triglyceride with a higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with those who had a lower Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. The former group also had a lower intake of daily calories, which comprised a lower proportion from fat and higher proportions from carbohydrate and protein, compared with the latter group. There were only modest between-group differences for the other variables.",570cfec0-875c-46f7-bf0f-f52fe65d46c3

The p-value was 0.423 for testing for linear relation. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.  Table 4 shows the associations of the 9 target nutrients with all-cause mortality. We observed that concordance with each component of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was not associated with a significant difference in all-cause mortality risk (all p > 0.1). Notably, a lower sodium intake (< 1,143 mg/1,000 kcal) was not associated with a decrease in mortality risk in the study population (adjusted HR 1.045, 95% CI 0.738 to 1.478, p = 0.803).

8,discussion0," We demonstrated that a higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (>2 vs. ≤ 2) was not associated with risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.003, 95% CI 0.760 to 1.323, p = 0.983) in patients with a history of heart failure during a median follow-up duration of 4.7 years. The findings were consistent across various subgroups (age, sex, body mass index, calorie intake, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease). Our results suggest that more evidence is needed for recommendation of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet for patients with heart failure to improve their outcomes.  Adopting a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern has been associated with a lower all-cause mortality rate in the general population (17–19) and in patients with hypertension (20). Assessment of sodium intake is one of the components of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (20).",d1b38957-7b89-46e3-88ec-2ceaef90f7d6
9,discussion1," Furthermore, dietary sodium restriction to prevent fluid overload has been endorsed as the cornerstone of therapy for patients with heart failure since the early 1950s (26). Nevertheless, it is not yet clear whether a dietary pattern concordance with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet helps reduce the mortality rate in patients with heart failure. In a cohort study of women who had experienced a hospitalization for heart failure (27), a higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was associated with a modest reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.00, p = 0.010). However, findings regarding the association between concordance with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and incident heart failure were not consistent (28–33).",8c7823eb-794a-44b1-8dd7-51e1c971f531
10,discussion2," We did not observe an association between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and all-cause mortality risk in patients with a history of heart failure (Table 3; Figure 2). Even if we selected participants who had a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score >4.5 and compared them with those who had a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score ≤ 2, there was no significant between-group difference in the risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.838, 95% CI 0.383, 1.835, p = 0.656). In this context, the current evidence is insufficient to recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet for patients with heart failure to improve their outcomes.  We further investigated the associations of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score components with all-cause mortality in our study population.",2bd2a172-1990-45ad-a547-57cf82351e91
11,discussion3," It is worth noting that sodium intake < 1,143 mg/1,000 kcal (score = 1) was not associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (Table 4). In a previous study which revealed a risk reduction for incident heart failure with an increase in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (29), the mean sodium intakes were similar (~2,500 mg/day) across the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score quartiles. Whether a restriction in dietary sodium reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases and mortality remains a subject of debate (34). A urinary sodium excretion rate of < 3.0 g/day (vs. 4.0–6.0 g/day) was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases or death in a large cohort study (35). Similar findings were noted regarding the associations of urinary sodium excretion and dietary sodium restriction with adverse heart failure outcomes (36–38).",e1519a62-f257-46b3-8464-cb46024aa380
12,discussion4," Our findings were in line with these reports, and were further supported by a recent randomized controlled trial (39) in which a low sodium diet (< 1,500 mg/day vs. usual care) was not associated with a risk reduction in clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure. These results may be partly explained by some detrimental effects associated with low sodium intake, such as decreased cardiac output and renal perfusion, and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (40). Hence, whether or not to recommend a low sodium diet for patients with heart failure deserves careful consideration.  In contrast, an increase in urinary potassium excretion attenuated the cardiovascular risk associated with high urinary sodium excretion (41). We observed a modest, but non-significant, reduction in all-cause mortality risk (adjusted HR 0.698, 95% CI 0.426 to 1.143, p = 0.",7f7b4a0a-866d-45e1-89b9-a2cac3d4cab7
13,discussion5,"151, Table 4) associated with a higher potassium intake (potassium score = 1, >2,238 mg/1,000 kcal) in our study population. The use of potassium-enriched salt instead of regular salt has been shown to decrease cardiovascular mortality in an elderly population (42). An increase in potassium intake may improve blood pressure control (43) and decrease cardiovascular disease risk (44). In an animal model of non-ischemic heart failure (45), a potassium-supplemented diet alleviated cardiorespiratory dysfunction compared with a normal diet. The possible benefit of potassium-enriched salt in patients with heart failure awaits further studies. Likewise, more research is needed to explore the potential benefits of magnesium (46, 47) and fiber (48) intakes on all-cause mortality in heart failure.  This study has several limitations. First, this was an observational study. Our findings need to be confirmed in interventional studies.",e64864d8-783b-457b-8cfb-7b39ed9a108b
14,discussion6," Second, information on nutritional intakes was obtained from a 24-h dietary recall interview. There might be some variations between the information from the 24-h recall and long-term dietary patterns. Third, we did not have information on left ventricular ejection fraction and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, as well as medical treatment for some chronic diseases, such as hypertension and heart failure. This should be taken into account when interpreting our results. Last, the median Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was only two in the study population. This indicates that the degree of concordance with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was low, which might help explain the null findings in this study. More evidence is required for specific recommendations of dietary components to improve outcomes in patients with heart failure. In this context, our results may have implications for future investigations.",666a0c1c-0353-497e-b3e4-8b8a5b958f63
15,discussion7,"  In conclusion, a higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (>2 vs. ≤ 2) was not associated with all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure. Notably, a decrease in sodium intake (sodium score = 1) was not associated with a significant difference in the risk of mortality. More studies are needed to elucidate the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on outcomes in patients with a history of heart failure.
