0,introduction0,"Globally, hypertension is a major cause of premature death and disability. Two of five adult individuals worldwide have raised blood pressure (BP) 1. Annually, more than 10 million deaths and 200 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) are attributable to elevated BP 2. Hypertension is undoubtedly a major risk factor for stroke, heart failure, coronary heart disease and chronic kidney disease. More than half of the deaths due to cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) are linked to complications from hypertension 3. Hypertension is also a major public health problem in India, affecting almost one in three adult individuals 4. Additionally, high BP is attributable to more than 1.5 million deaths and 38 million DALYs in India 5.  Optimal BP control is essential to prevent the premature deaths and related disability attributable to hypertension.",b3a2748c-7466-4c8e-bde3-be2ef5306ee5
1,introduction1," For example, a reduction of more than a third in the risk of stroke and a reduction of a quarter in the risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure are associated with optimal BP control in individuals with hypertension 6. However, BP control rates are abysmal in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) even with the availability of effective drugs for management of hypertension 7. The disproportionately higher number of deaths from elevated BP in LMICs as compared to high-income regions is largely attributable to sub-optimal control of BP.  Hypertension is prevalent in two of five adult individuals in the state of Kerala, India 8. Despite the availability of a relatively strong public health system 9, BP control rate is poor in Kerala. For example, the BP control rate at the population level in adults over 18 years was less than 15% in a recent state-wide representative survey conducted in Kerala 8.",faa0e546-02be-44f4-a5c8-7e50373d985a
2,introduction2," In order to achieve optimal BP control, it is desirable to identify the major road blocks and target them with comprehensive health system approaches.  Comprehensive management of hypertension requires both pharmacological and lifestyle modification. Self-care has been recognised as an important determinant for achieving optimal BP control at the individual level. According to the World Health Organisation (World Health Organisation (WHO)), self-care is defined as “the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health and to cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a healthcare provider” 10.",fee77497-3e75-4fc3-8c9d-101eaa68097d

However, research in the areas of self-care practices and BP control are limited in LMICs. We aimed to assess hypertension self-care practices and its impact on BP control among adult individuals with hypertension in Kerala. ",a7bb2b6d-bf19-4da7-ace3-0472a0a2ccb6

Physical activity and weight management are important measures to improve blood pressure control. However, these factors were not associated with blood pressure control in this study. The authors may want to discuss briefly why this might be the case.  While discussing no association between alcohol use and BP control the authors argue that this could be related to the amount of alcohol consumed but a more plausible reason in this study could be that a very few participants were using alcohol - 86.7% men and 100% women participants were alcohol abstinent. Therefore, finding an association between blood pressure control and alcohol use could be hard.

21,discussion0,"BP control is an important treatment goal for prevention of cardiovascular disease and related complications in individuals with hypertension. Self-care practices are sub-optimal and they are strongly associated with BP control in individuals with hypertension in Kerala. Additionally, family support enhances adherence to self-care practices related to BP management.  The overall BP control rate in our study population is higher than the data reported in previous studies from Kerala. For example, a large cross-sectional survey conducted in Kerala observed that BP control is only achieved in less than 15% of individuals with hypertension 8. As a standard practice in community-based surveys on hypertension prevalence, the above cited study included all individuals with elevated BP above the hypertension threshold of 140/90 mmHg in the ‘uncontrolled BP’ category.",7b14c7dd-d632-40ea-b34f-cfccd31be98c

However, we have included those who were diagnosed with hypertension for at least six months, started on at least one antihypertensive drug as part of initial management, and had a BP above the hypertension threshold in the ‘uncontrolled BP’ category in our study. Therefore, the control rate observed in our study is among individuals who were formally diagnosed and treated for hypertension. Unlike other facility-based surveys, our results are based on a representative community-based sample of individuals with diagnosed hypertension.  Self-care practice was less than optimal in our study population. Despite the prescription of treatment and the follow-up by Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) workers, only 55% were adherent to the medications.",c51ee908-87f7-4d9d-be39-86d6aae34301

Our study demonstrates that self-care practices are very important in achieving optimal control of BP. We show that those who were adherent to drugs, the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and non-smoking achieved better BP control than the non-adherent group. Consistent findings on adherence to medication and BP control are reported in other studies 19– 21.  BP control in individuals with hypertension often requires adherence to self-care activities beyond medications. However, self-care activities related to diet and smoking are often ignored. Clinical trial evidence suggests that a low sodium dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet improves the control of BP and reduces cardiovascular risk in individuals with hypertension 11.",2a807abc-90af-409c-8628-90d56fc5ee9c

Despite the known benefits of a low sodium dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, adherence to dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet components were abysmally poor in our study. Community-based strategies to improve adherence to dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet components 23 and policy initiatives promoting low sodium salt 24 may improve the BP control rate at the population level. Prescribing mandatory targets for the food industry, front of pack labelling, food procurement policies and taxation are some additional policy initiatives to reduce population level salt consumption 25.

Alcohol abstinence is also an important self-care practice that plays a significant role in the control of BP. In our study, alcohol use was not associated with BP control. However, the amount of alcohol consumption should be taken into consideration while exploring the association with BP control. In the INTERSALT study, a significant reduction in BP was observed in people who had limited their alcohol consumption 28. The potentially causal relationship between alcohol abstinence and BP reduction in the INTERSALT study provides further evidence to recommend alcohol reduction to control BP in hypertensive individuals.

Further, it calls for innovative family-based models such as the Programme of Lifestyle Intervention in Families (PROLIFIC study) in managing BP 29. The PROLIFIC model vouches for a family centred strategy for lifestyle changes and self-care for cardiovascular risk reduction.

Conclusion Overall, BP control is achieved in two of five participants with diagnosed hypertension and on treatment in Kerala at the community level. Further, compliance to self-care practices are less than optimal in the study population. Optimal adherence to self-care strategies is important in improving BP control rate in individual with hypertension.

These findings support evaluation of self-care and family-support interventions to improve control of hypertension which is a leading risk factor for death and disability globally.",c5b00d32-edcf-4f90-9b23-b930392726f6
35,discussion14," There is very little information on self-care and family support for hypertension control in community settings in India so this study is important.   It is a well conducted study. The authors could get a response rate of 100% which is really hard to achieve in field studies.   I have some suggestions which are listed below.   Title The title needs to reflect that the study was conducted in India. Abstract   The abstract is concise. The authors should define BP control in the abstract by specifying the cut offs e.g. <140/90.   Introduction   The introduction is well written, explains the rationale for conducting this study and provides the objectives of the study.  The statement ‘disproportionately higher number of deaths from elevated BP in LMICs…attributable to suboptimal control of BP’ needs a reference.  The statement ‘self-care has been recognized as an important determinant…at the individual level’ also needs a reference.   Methods   The methods section is clearly written.",55253c5d-3630-427c-8130-27c9af2899bf
36,discussion15," It would be beneficial for the readers if the authors can provide the rationale for conducting this study in the Kollam district of Kerala.  The authors state that they drew 23 individuals with hypertension randomly from the population-based listing of all individuals with diagnosed hypertension. However, the source of this list is unclear. Was this list prepared during the population-based screening of hypertension under the national programme for prevention and control of chronic diseases? Was the list obtained from the primary health centres?  The authors state that self-care activities were captured using H-SCALE tool. The authors have attached the tool in the supplement but it will be beneficial for the readers to describe in brief what the key components of this tool are in the methods section.",a9459f2d-41b9-4d84-92e0-3866c4f7adca
37,discussion16,"  In defining medications adherence, adherence to dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, physical activity engagement, weight management, family support the authors provide certain cut-offs to classify these activities as good or mild, moderate and strong. What was the rationale for selecting these thresholds? It will be good to state this in the methods. ",2c38bfae-3a8f-4c97-9209-96f57e4cd953
