0,methods0," 2.1. Study Population  This was a secondary analysis of clinical and dietary data gathered on participants in the University of Michigan Head and Neck Specialized Program of Research Excellence (UM-SPORE) cohort. UM-SPORE is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of newly diagnosed patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who presented with primary malignancies in the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx and entered the study before the initiation of any treatment for primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Recruitment was conducted through the UM Hospital System and took place between November 2008 through October 2014, whereby newly diagnosed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cases were screened and solicited consent for inclusion into the study. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study.",e30e6f5b-f6c3-4622-9aaa-50f5300af8ee
1,methods1," Exclusion criteria for the study are detailed as: (i) age less than 18 years; (ii) being pregnant; (iii) being a non-English speaker; (iv) having a previously diagnosed mental disorder; (v) previous or concomitant diagnosis of a tumor in the non-upper aerodigestive tract; and (vi) previous diagnosis with another form of primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) within the last five years. Upon entry, participants completed a baseline (pretreatment) food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) and survey questionnaires ascertaining lifestyle and epidemiologic characteristics. Survey measures included history of other identified comorbid conditions, smoking status, drinking status, sleep, physical activity, and depression. All baseline (pretreatment) data collection was conducted before the initiation of any treatment protocol for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and participants were subsequently followed longitudinally.",37ec8716-d75d-46d6-805e-c30e43ca96bd
2,methods2," Annual reviews of electronic medical records were used to extract clinical factors, including cancer stage, site, and treatment protocol data.  There were 380 participants with baseline and 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) data, which also had complete baseline/pretreatment food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data. Further exclusions included those with missing body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) data (n = 8) and those missing data on any other covariates used in the study (n = 3). Subjects reporting caloric intakes of >5000 kcal/d or <500 kcal/d (n = 5) were excluded on the premise that these levels of intake are likely implausible, making these observations unreliable, which may bias the final results [13].",1c797f84-915a-47b1-bfad-44376bd3563f
3,methods3," Furthermore, participants with tumors at sites other than the larynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or oral cavity (n = 31), missing full pages of their pretreatment food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (n = 9), and having greater than 70 blank responses on their food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (n = 1) were excluded from the analysis [14]. The final analytic sample comprised 323 participants. All study procedures were executed in compliance with standards approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRB approval number, for which consent was granted for obtaining and analyzing the data, is HUM00042189) and complied with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.  2.2.",f842144c-39f2-4ca3-a774-8751c9f6b1c7
4,methods4," Predictors: Pretreatment a Priori Diet Quality Index Scores  Baseline dietary intake data were collected using the self-administered 2007 Harvard Adult food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), a 131-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) formulated to assess the usual intake of select foods, beverages, and supplements and is used to compute a profile of average nutrient intake for a given participant [15,16]. This method affords a practical approach for ranking the participant sample based on relative food and nutrient intake. Participants were asked to complete the questionnaire based on what they believe their usual intakes for select foods and beverages were over the past year. This was prompted through inquiries that accounted for standard portion sizes and frequency (e.g., 2–4 times per week, 1 medium banana).",66224ab6-c4da-429e-8dae-00f196b98a1b
5,methods5," Nutrient intakes were computed by taking proportional weights corresponding to the frequency of intake selected for a given food item, multiplying by the nutrient value for the portion/serving size established on the questionnaire, and then summing across all foods [15]. Nutrient composition values were estimated using the Harvard nutrient database.  Four frequently cited a priori-defined diet quality indices were chosen for the analysis. These included the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)), the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Index (aMED), the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010), and a low-carbohydrate diet index. The choice to use these particular indices arose from their widespread use in the nutritional epidemiology literature and, specifically, within the context of chronic disease risk and management [17,18,19].",7b523146-2545-46ab-b282-637141f5ccc4
6,methods6," Nutrient- and item-specific intake levels were estimated from the administered Harvard food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data and used to calculate diet quality index scores.  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has previously been described and is extensively documented as a treatment protocol in hypertension. This dietary pattern emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, nuts, and legumes while limiting intakes of red meat, sweets, and sugar-sweetened beverages [20]. Concerning nutrient intakes, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is characterized by reduced intakes of salt (sodium chloride), saturated and total fat, and increased intake of foods with high mineral (primarily potassium and magnesium) and micronutrient value. Calculation of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet scores was adapted to this cohort using the framework described by Fung et al. [21].",5e44294e-419e-4d84-bf91-988fe80e5628
7,methods7," The operationalization of this dietary protocol ranks participants according to their average intake in 8 select food group components: fruits, vegetables, nuts/legumes, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, sodium, red and processed meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages. Scores for each of the first five listed components were taken as the quintile ranking for a participant for that food group. Component scores for the latter three components were assigned antagonistically. Individuals scoring within the highest quintile of intake were given a score of “1”, whereas those residents to the lowest quintile of intake were given a score of “5”. Summing scores across all components allowed us to arrive at the final composite score, which had a maximum value of 40.  The aMED diet quality index is based on the operationalization provided by Fung et al. [18].",1a564db4-9c3d-437f-bca5-3b616deb69b9
8,methods8," The traditional Mediterranean diet pattern has been characterized by high intakes of fruits, vegetables, breads, cereals, legumes, high-quality fats (primarily olive oil) [22]. Moderate to low intakes of red meat, fish, low-fat dairy, and alcohol (primarily wine) also make up intrinsic components. This dietary pattern is further stipulated by its limiting of foods with a processed origin. Calculation of the aMED score considers intake levels of 9 components that were obtained from participant food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data: vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, whole grains, red or processed meats, fish, alcohol, and the ratio of monounsaturated/saturated (UFA/SFA) fat intake. Component scores were based on a participant’s rank relative to the median intake for that component. That is, those with intakes greater than the median were given a score of “1”, while those falling below the median were given a score of “0”.",0510f465-092d-4426-9888-1580505730f3
9,methods9," For the meat component, falling above the median intake resulted in a score of “0”, while ranking below the median gave participants a score of “1”. Alcohol intakes between 5 and 15 g/d were designated a score of “1” for the alcohol component. The final composite score was computed by summing scores across all of the 9 components, with a maximum score of 9.  The AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) was developed in 2002 as an alternative to the Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)), which operationalized the 1995 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and was tailored with the intention of being a more robust indicator of chronic disease risk [19]. This diet quality index was subsequently updated in 2010 and emphasized similar food components to the aforementioned indices with additional foci on trans fat (as a percentage of total energy intake), polyunsaturated fatty acids (as a percentage of total energy intake), and n − 3 (EPA + DHA) fatty acid intake.",8e520552-8adf-43b2-9cbf-c1424af492fe
10,methods10," Similar to the calculation of aMED, it awards points for the moderate consumption of alcohol. Operationalizing the index relies on mapping intakes for each food category to a scale ranging from 0 to 10. The scoring algorithm has been previously described by Chiuve et al., and the maximum attainable score for any given participant is 110 [19].  Finally, a low-carbohydrate index, standing in as a proxy for a ketogenic diet, was computed as previously described by Halton et al. [23]. Briefly, percentages of energy intake from each of carbohydrate, fat, and protein were calculated for the study subjects, and they were subsequently partitioned and ranked according to quantiles of intake for each category. For the protein and fat categories, scores were allocated congruently with participant rank (i.e., a rank of “1” was commensurate to a score of “1”). For the carbohydrate score, scores were allocated antagonistically (i.e., a rank of 10 resulted in a score of “0”).",a3fc8b61-0fd6-4e9f-a972-d2f88da79857
11,methods11," A theoretical maximum score of 30 was attainable for this index.  2.3. Covariates  Sociodemographic covariates included age (modeled continuously), sex (modeled dichotomously), and education status (coded as less than or equal to high school or some college or more). Behavioral characteristics included in our models consisted of smoking status (modeled categorically as never, former, or current). The clinical variables were body mass index (BMI) (modeled dichotomously as <25—normal or underweight—or ≥25—overweight or obese), tumor human papillomavirus (HPV) infection status (modeled as positive, negative, or equivocal/missing test), cancer stage (modeled dichotomously as 0, I, II or III, IV), and tumor site (modeled categorically as larynx, oral cavity, oropharynx, or hypopharynx).",2183d529-298b-4b14-8d10-5cab72814eaf
12,methods12," All models examining 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) variables as their outcome were adjusted for their baseline categorical groupings, derived from their corresponding scale values at baseline (groups were dichotomized as outlined below). Lastly, all models adjusted for total energy intake by including total calories (kcal) as a continuous variable. Treatment modality, sex, and drinking status were given a priori consideration for inclusion but were omitted given that they previously were shown to be highly correlated with other covariates among this patient cohort [24]. Nonetheless, subanalyses included examining associations amongst the different treatment levels to account for any varying effects of particular treatment protocols on nutrition impact symptoms (NIS), as detailed below.  2.4.",de1c64c8-8b18-4242-b253-cbadb12e5bac
13,methods13," Outcomes: nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) at 1-Year Postdiagnosis  Six levels of nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) (trismus, xerostomia, dysphagia with liquids, dysphagia with solid foods, difficulty chewing, and taste perception) were assessed and quantified using the UM Head and Neck Quality of Life (quality of life (QOL)) Questionnaire developed and validated for use in this patient population by Terrell et al. [25]. This 37-item survey evaluates the landscape of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patient quality of life (QOL) by emphasizing four meaningful domains: communication, eating, emotion, and pain. Six items encompassing the eating subdomain were used to measure the aforementioned outcome variables, and available responses were provided on a discrete 5-point scale from “not at all bothered” (given a numerical score of “1”) to “extremely bothered” (indicating a score of “5”).",fa42de13-9253-4f62-8eb7-ee3365071bb9
14,methods14," An additional item, assessing the burning pain and discomfort that characterizes mucositis, was included and extracted from the pain domain of the questionnaire. Mucositis has been shown to impact dietary intake and thus was included in the analysis for this reason [9,26]. Responses to each of these individual items were dichotomized into categories “not at all bothered” and “slightly to extremely bothered”, as was previously done by members of our research team [27]. A composite symptom summary measure using 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) data was developed by taking the sum of participant responses across these seven items. A maximum value of 35 was attainable on this index, representing the most severe symptom burden. Subsequently, participants were dichotomized into groups based on a median-split, with nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) symptom summary score <12 defined as a low-symptom burden and scores ≥ 12 defining those experiencing a high-symptom burden.",4dc8e91d-015f-474c-bb6b-03917176c4eb
15,methods15," This threshold value was chosen and based on a previous operationalization of this scale [27].  2.5. Statistical Analysis  Descriptive analyses were performed, examining frequencies and means across demographic, behavioral, and clinical factors. The mean 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) summary score was evaluated across relevant epidemiologic characteristics and tabulated. One-way analysis of variance (and tabulated One way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) was used to assess for significant differences in mean 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) summary scores across levels of the characteristics examined. Tukey’s post-hoc mean separation test was implemented to partition significantly different groups within the different characteristics examined. Bivariate relationships were evaluated with Pearson correlation coefficients computed amongst the four a priori diet quality indices chosen for the analysis.",cfd1074e-be63-47c6-b6e1-a4b7f6f25d3e
16,methods16,"  Continuous and discrete scores from the four a priori diet quality indices were categorized by quintiles. Multivariable binary logistic regression models were fit to evaluate the associations between each a priori diet quality index score and the relevant outcomes. In total, there were eight models constructed for each diet quality index score: (i) a separate model for each of the seven symptoms introduced above and (ii) a model examining the dichotomized 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) summary score rank as the outcome of interest. All primary analytical models adjusted for participant age, smoking status, body mass index (BMI) category, total calories, educational status, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, cancer stage, tumor site, and the corresponding symptom score group at baseline. All analyses used the lowest quintile (Q1) of intake as the referent group. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals were computed and tabulated.",b2f1506c-17c6-4f52-a4be-9213441d4e9a
17,methods17," Tests for linear trend were assessed by assigning the median value of a participant’s corresponding quintile and modeling that term as a continuous variable. To assess whether single food group or nutrient categories (measured as either servings per day or total mass in grams) would be able to recapitulate results from models using the composite indices, sixteen additional models were fit, using quintiles of intake for different categories of foods and nutrients that, together, make up the components of the calculated indices.  Stratified analyses (for the outcome of 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) symptom summary score) were conducted and examined the tested associations across strata for baseline body mass index (BMI), smoking status, cancer stage, education, tumor site, and treatment modality (radiation versus no radiation used).",d4c79ccb-ba24-471f-8325-d81a92dd2bfe
18,methods18," Stratified models used a truncated set of covariates (age, smoking status, stage, total calories, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status) to ensure adequate model fit and preserve statistical power with the smaller subsets. A sensitivity analysis, used to evaluate for the potential of reverse causality explaining our results, was conducted, where models were fitted separately on subjects reporting no symptoms at study entry/pretreatment (n = 72) and those with at least some degree of symptomatology at study entry (n = 251). Furthermore, restricted cubic spline models were fit to visually ascertain the observed relationships, examine linearity, and assess dose-dependence between each dietary predictor and the odds of 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) summary score ≥12. These models used four interior knots, set at the scores corresponding to quintiles of the respective diet quality index.",9640a36d-05eb-4edb-a4b2-6e75351a73c7
19,methods19," The median of the lowest quintile of intake for each diet quality index was used as the referent value when computing odds ratios from these models. All analyses were conducted at α = 0.05 and performed in RStudio version 1.4.  3. Results  3.1. Sample Characteristics  Table 1 provides descriptive statistics and means for the analytic cohort. The average age of the analyzed sample was 60.4 years. Generally, age was larger in the highest quintile of intake relative to the lowest for each of the four diet quality indices examined. This cohort contained a majority of males (n = 254; 78.6%). There tended to be a higher proportion of females within the highest quintile of the diet quality indices compared to the lowest quintile. Of note, most participants identified as non-Hispanic white (n = 310; 96.9%). body mass index (BMI) was variable across the different indices, and it had no clear relationship with quintiles of the diet quality indices.",0000a8cb-b23c-4ede-b8ad-d0262f73ba9e
20,methods20," Regarding the behavioral variables, proportions of current smokers tended to be higher within the lowest quintile of the examined indices and were most pronounced for AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), whereas former and never smoker proportions were higher in the highest quintiles of the aMED, AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) indices. Drinking status across quintiles of the indices also suggested higher proportions of current consumption within the lowest quintile compared to the highest (this was true for all indices but most pronounced for aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)). The differences seen in human papillomavirus (HPV) status across quintiles of those indices appeared to follow the patterns in smoking status, to an extent except for the low-carbohydrate index. There were no other appreciable differences in distributions of participant characteristics.  3.",bafe1a95-1b8b-4456-98ee-ed07d5917fff
21,methods21,"2. nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) Symptom Summary Scores and Potential Confounders  Concerning the 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) symptom summary score, the primary analytical outcome, individuals with lower educational background (≤high school completed) tended to have a significantly, albeit slightly, higher symptom burden score (p < 0.01). A significant association within tumor site was also identified (p < 0.01). More pronounced symptomatology was reported in participants with oropharynx vs larynx tumors. Subjects classified with stage III or IV tumors had significantly higher nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) symptom scores than those with tumors staged 0, I, or II (p < 0.01). Additionally, several significant differences in symptom scores were noted across treatment classes (p < 0.01). All of these described differences are documented in Table 2.  3.3.",55f502be-69d3-4051-a355-30b0fd28604e
22,methods22," Diet Quality Scores  Summary statistics for each of the diet quality indices examined and results of the correlational analysis are found in Table 3 and Table S1, respectively. Median scores for the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, aMED, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and the low-carbohydrate index with the analyzed sample were 58.54 (Min: 22.85, Max: 89.14), 4 (Min: 0, Max: 9), 24 (Min: 10, Max: 37), and 15 (Min: 0, Max: 30), respectively, and were generally commensurate to the estimated sample means. aMED, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 scores all shared Pearson correlation coefficients suggestive of moderately strong and positive relationships. aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were weakly and inversely correlated with the low-carbohydrate score, while the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 shared a weak, positive correlation with the low-carbohydrate index.  3.4.",03050504-8cda-4060-97b9-0b68bafddfd9
23,methods23," nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) Symptom Burden 1-Year Postdiagnosis  We evaluated the associations between consumption along a priori diet quality scores, derived from food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s, using multivariable binary logistic regression. These results are referenced from Table 4. When examining the associations between baseline aMED diet quality index scores and responses to the seven nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) symptom scales at 1-year postdiagnosis, it was found that higher consumption along this index was strongly and inversely associated with dysphagia of liquids and, to a lesser extent, with dysphagia of solids, difficulty chewing, xerostomia, and mucositis. A strong and significant inverse relationship with the nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) 1-year symptom summary score was also observed (ORQ5-Q1: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.14–0.88, ptrend = 0.04).",fe896003-0271-4851-803a-b0fe59824973
24,methods24," Closer adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) protocol was significantly inversely associated with all 1-year symptom scales besides trismus, mucositis, and dysphagia solids. However, the parameter estimates in all of these models for each of quintiles 2–5 were suggestive of a protective association that failed to meet the threshold for statistical significance. The strongest inverse relationship was that with xerostomia (ORQ5-Q1: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.08–0.85, ptrend = 0.04). Higher consumption along the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index was also potently and significantly inversely associated with the 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) summary score (ORQ5-Q1: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.15–0.91, ptrend = 0.02). Associations along the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 index were more modest, with the strongest inverse association seen in xerostomia (ORQ5-Q1: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.14–1.21, ptrend = 0.04).",3f66f7d1-5c09-4c01-b7dc-c689f45732c3
25,methods25," There was no significant linear trend observed between consumption along AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and the 1-year symptom summary score, though the parameter estimate for the highest quintile of intake suggested a nonsignificant inverse association with a blunted effect estimate relative to the aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) indices. No significant inverse associations were noted between higher consumption along the low-carbohydrate index and any of the eight outcomes examined. Notably, there was a positive association between higher pretreatment consumption of the low-carbohydrate index and the odds of experiencing dysphagia with liquids at the 1-year mark (ORQ5-Q1: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.06-5.91, ptrend = 0.19). Most of the parameter estimates for the highest quintile of intake in the models considering individual symptoms as outcomes and low-carbohydrate diet score as the explanatory variable were greater than 1 except for trismus, taste, and mucositis.",8d30f2f3-e6ac-4821-a29a-fc716fd24b5d
26,methods26," Though failing to meet the threshold for statistical significance, the parameter estimates for each of the second, third, and fifth quintiles of the low-carbohydrate index were all suggestive of a positive association with the 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) symptom summary score. The results of the set of restricted cubic splines analyses, modeling each diet quality index as a continuous variable and subsequently mapping index scores to their respective odds ratios from spline estimates, are visualized in Figure 1.  3.5. Analyses Using Single Nutrient Explanatory Variables  Modeling nutrient categories or food groups in place of the diet quality indices resulted in an abundance of non-significant figures (Table 5). There were a few notable exceptions. Total fruit consumption was strongly and inversely associated with the 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) summary score.",8b942abf-bd05-4a98-a168-2dca81a36438
27,methods27," Moreover, total nut consumption saw a very similar magnitude of association compared to fruit intake as the explanatory variable. A weaker inverse association was found for a model considering total n-3 fatty acid intake.  3.6. Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses  Stratified analyses revealed disparities in several reported associations between diet quality and 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) symptom summary score among levels of body mass index (BMI), smoking status, cancer stage, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, education attained, tumor site, and treatment modality. The results of this analysis are found in Table S2. There were few marked distinctions in the magnitude of associations compared to the results from primary analytical models.",0653ee44-794b-4823-ae53-c7979dbf49c0
28,methods28," Those reporting lower educational status had significantly stronger magnitudes of association relative to those in higher education levels for the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, aMED, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) indices. Remarkably, the effect sizes in all tumor site levels were commensurate with the estimates from the overall model except for the association of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index with 1-year nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) in the larynx subgroup (note that hypopharynx was omitted from this part of the analysis due to small sample size, n = 4). When examining levels of stage, the directionality and magnitude of the associations observed from the primary models were similar to those seen in either of the binary categories of stage, and the same can be said for the levels of human papillomavirus (HPV) status examined.",e89cffb6-aac2-46cb-aeab-ea59e1bf5462
29,methods29," In consideration of participant treatment protocol, when evaluating models on participants who either received some form of radiation or those who did not, effect sizes for all indices were similar, and no substantial differences were appreciated. Finally, when models examining the relationships of baseline dietary indices on nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) 1-year postdiagnosis were fit on a sample subset of individuals entering the study without any symptoms at baseline, it was found that the parameter estimates were generally consistent with those from the primary analytical models including all sample subjects (Table S3). Again, the strongest inverse associations within this subset were found in the higher quantiles of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and aMED pretreatment index indices.",b92ea00e-7705-4e68-b813-2b0f973ed727
30,methods30," In the case of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index, these findings suggest a 76% reduction in the odds of significant nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) symptoms 1-year postdiagnosis for those entering the study without significant symptomatology and adhering closest to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index compared to those also entering the study with no nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) but with the poorest adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) protocol at study entry. The results were similar in those presenting with nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) at study entry, and this analysis was performed to evaluate for the possibility of reverse causation, whereby nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) present at pretreatment may have affected dietary adherence to the indices and, thus, distorted the relationship between explanatory variables and the outcomes in this analysis.  4.",cd90979d-0f8a-41b7-b0ac-d983bad8dd81
31,methods31," Discussion  We evaluated associations between four a priori-defined diet quality indices and found that greater adherence to the aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary protocols during the year before treatment were each associated with diminished risks of experiencing self-reported nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) 1-year postdiagnosis. When analyzing individual nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) separately, it was found that several nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) were inversely associated with closer adherence to these indices. Overall, the aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) indices exhibited the most robust sets and the most numerous inverse associations when examining individual and overall nutrition impact symptoms (NIS).",c9fc75be-056e-4d6c-b6bf-886207864f6a
32,methods32," The highest adherence category in each of the aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) indices exhibited a 64% and 62% reduction, respectively, in the odds of experiencing significant nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) burden at 1-year postdiagnosis relative to the lowest quintile of intake. These associations were followed in magnitude and significance by, to an even lesser extent, the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 index. In contrast, adhering to a ketogenic style, low-carbohydrate pattern was not associated with mitigations in self-reported nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) at the 1-year time point either when examining the nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) summary score or when analyzing any individual nutrition impact symptoms (NIS). It was apparent that there may potentially be a detrimental influence of this low-carbohydrate diet quality index on symptom burden within the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) population.",c679db5e-4617-4cb1-8dad-de41078cd0d7
33,methods33," However, these findings would need to be replicated and investigated further in clinical settings before these conclusions are ascertained.  When stratifying results by relevant participant characteristics reported at baseline, we found those significant associations were more pronounced in subjects with higher self-reported attained education status. Nevertheless, it should be acknowledged that participants in the group reporting greater attained education status (some college or more) had higher mean scores on all indices examined (results not shown). It is conceivable to hypothesize that participants in the lower education level were more likely to benefit from closer adherence to these indices, given potentially lower overall adherence. Reported associations for subjects who received radiation as part of their treatment protocol did not appear to diverge appreciably from those who did not receive radiation in their treatment regimen.",db0adbde-5d15-4b9a-88b0-2f4a7a1cc24c
34,methods34," This observed phenomenon appears to be somewhat inconsistent with reports in the literature of radiation-induced dysphagia and impaired swallowing function [12,28]. Notably, no single food groups, nutrients, or nutrient categories, other than total fruit and nut intakes, demonstrated associations as or more potent as those reported for the aMED or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) indices. This highlights the ability of a priori diet quality indices to act as multidimensional factors that capture synergisms between food components and consequently significant associations that would otherwise go undetected in single nutrient or food group analyses.  We previously reported the associations between two a posteriori-derived dietary patterns and the same outcomes studied herein [27].",4d0864aa-b71c-4eb3-bf3b-f69e82bba53c
35,methods35," To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the relationships between the four chosen a priori-defined diet quality indices and those outcomes in the head and neck cancer patient population. Whereas empirically derived a posteriori dietary patterns, computed through methods such as principal components analysis or reduced rank regression, are patterns that are specific to and describe the populations under scrutiny, a priori-defined composites are routinely based on sets of predefined or established guidelines, thus underscoring the practicality of these dietary patterns across different populations. Consequently, identifying a priori indices that are particularly applicable and beneficial, in a population-specific manner, facilitates public health messaging and subsequent adoption of those protocols for given populations.",3bf43dfd-22b0-4405-857f-14a448ae17b2
36,methods36," The shrewdness of a priori or a posteriori indices has been extolled for its ability to more accurately model the complexity of diet as an epidemiologic or clinical exposure in human studies [29]. There are correlations or interactions amongst nutrients or foods that either blunt or bolster certain associations. Indeed, we observed this phenomenon in our study by modeling each nutrient or food category individually and finding that nutrients or food groups alone did not yield the degree of associations that were, instead, capitulated by modeling each diet quality indices. This analysis identified the aMED index as the most robust indicator of baseline diet quality that predicted reduced symptomatology 1 year following diagnosis. This performance was followed by that of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index with very similar results.",03274194-e547-48a5-a30b-230befe6f714
37,methods37,"  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was developed and demonstrated in 1997 as a dietary intervention for curbing hypertension-related sequelae [30]. Since its inception, the diet has been validated in numerous capacities and has drawn noteworthy recognition, being a focal point of national guidelines, particularly intended for those with hypertension [31]. Nonetheless, the tenets of the diet are typically in line with what many consider to be a “healthy” diet not only for hypertension, but for overall well-being and longevity. A Mediterranean diet is among the most frequently cited dietary patterns in the literature on longevity and chronic illness [32]. Though the guidelines for adhering to this regimen remain, in some respects, arcane and ambiguous, the principal emphasis of this pattern lies in the consumption of foods primarily of plant-based origin, olive oil as the chief lipid source, with minimal amounts of animal-derived foods and products [33].",48082b23-e417-4a09-a507-9414feae69a5
38,methods38," Several methods of quantifying the eating patterns of populations inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea regions have been reported in the literature, and the aMED index represents one iteration. In many respects, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and aMED are similar, especially regarding how scores of adherence were tallied in this analysis. Both indices positively reward the consumption of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes and castigate the consumption of red and processed meats. However, there are some notable differences. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index includes additional components for low-fat dairy and sodium consumptions while not including components for fish and alcohol intake and a score for the ratio of fat sources in the diet like the aMED index stresses. In our study, food group subanalyses were not strongly associated with the outcome of nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) burden 1-year postdiagnosis.",35207222-21b7-4fa5-ada0-e7696ffaf636
39,methods39," There was a nonsignificant downward trend in nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) burden across quintiles of low dairy intake. However, other food groups that differ across the indices, such as alcohol intake and sodium, were not predictive of the study’s primary analytical outcome. Again, this lack of association may relate to the relative advantage of using dietary patterns over single food groups. However, we posit that the difference in index algorithms is likely at play when the disparities between the performance of each of these indices are appreciated.  Alcohol intake is a known independent risk factor for incident head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)s, a family of cancers with strong ties to environmental etiologies, particularly in those cases lacking human papillomavirus (HPV) seropositivity [34,35].",1f1fb606-b726-4621-919a-176c2e86736b
40,methods40," There have been few findings reported in how alcohol consumption impacts nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cases with continuing alcohol use. Nevertheless, considering the findings that the aMED performed best amongst all indices examined and had an alcohol component appears to be somewhat consistent with those results reported by Potash et al. In their study of 283 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients at 1-year postdiagnosis, it was reported that current “social drinkers” had the highest proportion of oral eating function compared to all other groups [36]. However, those labeled as “problem drinkers” were found to have compromised oral function compared to the social-drinking group. We can postulate variability in index performance is due to differences in the way alcohol consumption is rewarded.",87bd30c1-f91e-4b9e-b227-ed2d865c7d68
41,methods41," However, given the equivocal nature of the current evidence to back this conjecture, we propose that more research is warranted for delineating the effects of continued alcohol consumption, postdiagnosis, on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) symptom burden. Further, it should also be noted that subject classification according to AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 is based on absolute values of intake, whereas aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) are based on quantiles of intake within the analyzed sample, which reduces the risk of bias due to misclassification. The use of a method based on quantile classifications, rather than absolute values of intake, is substantiated by the fact that food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data, which was employed in this analysis, typically underperforms when the aim is to quantify absolute values of intake accurately but remains a viable method for ranking or distinguishing study subjects based on relative intake [14].",81737b98-2177-4f6f-b11d-781d13037de7
42,methods42,"  The potential beneficial effects imparted by higher adherence to either aMED or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) indices are presumably mediated by the high consumption of plant-based foods, providing a food matrix that is ubiquitously filled with anti-inflammatory nutrients and phytochemical components. The consumption of these foods at baseline is plausibly linked to blunted symptomatology 1-year postdiagnosis by way of quenched reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) that may, otherwise, perpetuate nutrition impact symptoms (NIS). Mechanistically, the selective and antagonistic effects of phytochemical agents and other dietary bioactive compounds on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in preclinical study designs have been previously described [37,38].",a8a02f75-172a-4209-8ceb-d8fe4438a825
43,methods43," Moreover, results from a set of randomized control trials investigating the effects of α-tocopherol and β-carotene on radiation-induced toxicities in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients suggested a potential therapeutic role of foods rich in those nutrients for mitigating nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) [39,40]. This hypothesis may be further substantiated by the results of analyses considering the low-carbohydrate index as the primary predictor, which was void of any significant association suggestive of a protective effect. Given that this index is composed of nutrient components rather than food groups, it is difficult to ascertain what types of foods contribute to higher adherence scores. Yet, it is valid to assume that the foods highest in fat and protein and lowest in dietary carbohydrates are those of animal origin, which include red and processed meats.",f599b2d7-699c-40a0-85e0-6c14e24690de
44,methods44," Indeed, it was found in bivariate analyses (results not shown here) that total red and processed meat intake was positively correlated with the low-carbohydrate index (r = 0.28, p < 0.001) and that the index baring the strongest inverse relationship with red and processed meat intake was Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) (r = −0.38, p < 0.001). Red and processed meats are inherently devoid of phytochemical constituents that produce the anti-inflammatory effects we discuss and may, instead possess proinflammatory potential [40]. Interestingly, we did find a significant positive association between closer adherence to the low-carbohydrate index and increased odds of having dysphagia accompanying liquids, though there was no significant association with total symptom burden 1-year postdiagnosis. These results were similar to those reported between the “western” dietary pattern and the same outcome studied here in our analysis of a posteriori-derived dietary patterns [27].",6f391cd8-8630-498f-ba9a-b4127e17dd9f
45,methods45,"  There are some limitations to our study that are worth stating. Though the longitudinal design is a strength of the study, the use of baseline data to predict outcomes 1-year postdiagnosis may be confounded by diet changes implemented within that period. It is germane to posit that several participants may have adopted “healthier” diet changes in the intervening time window following their diagnosis. This would, potentially, explain why significant associations within the low-carbohydrate index were not ascertained, for instance. Though the 2007 Harvard food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), utilized for dietary collection in this study, has been validated for use in the general population, it has yet to be validated for the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) population. Moreover, recall bias and other systematic biases accompanying the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) as the principal means of collecting dietary data should not be overlooked.",a2c414f7-8e5d-430c-9a9e-298a0001bae1
46,methods46," Likewise, although the UM Head and Neck quality of life (QOL) Questionnaire has been validated in this patient population, the use of the nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) symptom summary score has not. Lastly, as is the case with any observational study design, the possibility of residual confounding and reverse causality cannot be ruled out.  5. Conclusions  Dietary patterns adhering to the guidelines forwarded by the aMED or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) protocols were significantly associated with decreased odds of aggregate nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) symptom burden 1-year postdiagnosis. Other indices, AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and a low-carbohydrate index, showed attenuated, null, or in some cases positive associations.",1ea55077-3718-4707-a596-104f8bb5799d
47,methods47," In summary, our findings suggest that promoting consumption of a diet abundant in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, legumes, nuts, while minimal in red and processed meat and sodium levels may ameliorate aggregate symptom burden in newly diagnosed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients.
