0,introduction0," dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) (Dietary approach to stop hypertension) diet is one of the healthy dietary patterns that was established for patients with hypertension in the 1990s.1 The dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet is characterized by a high amount of fiber including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and a low intake of sodium and sweets while emphasizing the consumption of low-fat dairy products, white meat, and nuts.1 Adherence to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern has demonstrated beneficial effects on the treatment of hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome.2-4 Indeed, previous studies have shown that nutrition status is closely related to the inception of these diseases.5-8 To clarify other positive aspects of this healthy diet, examining the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet based on other dietary quality indices will be helpful.",f10fb934-40e2-4581-a384-98e232493691
1,introduction1,"   Several indices of healthy eating have been developed to reveal the level of adherence to a specified dietary pattern in the last three decades. They provide an approach which assesses diet quality as a whole compared to the less preferred method of individual nutrient content and the consideration of single foods.9 Diet quality refers to both food variety and nutrient adequacy.10 Previous studies indicated that the dietary diversity score (Dietary diversity score (DDS)), Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AlternativeHealthy Eating Index (AHEI)), nutrient adequacy ratio (nutrient adequacy ratio (NAR)) and mean adequacy ratio (mean adequacy ratio (MAR)), as well as dietary energy density (dietary energy density (DED)), are suitable indicators for diet quality assessments.11,12 Dietary diversity score (DDS) focuses on the variety of food intake to reduce mortality and morbidity.",9e961350-c554-4625-b857-ba209be7b4e5
2,introduction2,"13 Furthermore, it has been shown that Dietary diversity score (DDS) is a good indicator for the adequacy of some micro-nutrients. Prior studies reported that Dietary diversity score (DDS) is associated with cardiovascular risk factors,14 obesity, abdominal adiposity,15 and metabolic syndrome.12,16 Other diet quality indices emphasize the consumption of healthy foods and the restriction of less healthy ones.12,17   Due to the previous research in Tehran it is evident that overall diet quality status of Tehranian women needs to be improved. Based on the 2015 Dietary Guidelines, the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is an example of a healthy eating pattern that can be considered practical and accessible to the public.",4939621d-1c18-4d3b-907b-9d72fbe45398
3,introduction3," While the relationship between the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and chronic metabolic disease has been studied,18-20 the association between the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and other dietary quality indices is not well understood. Specifically, the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet has not been investigated regarding the overall diet quality status of women in Iran. The present study aimed to assess the association between the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet score and diet quality indices among Iranian women.

Dietary diversity score (Dietary diversity score (DDS)), dietary energy density (dietary energy density (DED)), adherence to dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, AlternativeHealthy Eating Index (AlternativeHealthy Eating Index (AHEI)) and mean adequacy ratio (mean adequacy ratio (MAR)) were examined as suggested by previous articles. Dietary quality indices, anthropometric indices, and dietary intake were categorized based on dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) tertiles. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire with 168items was used for dietary assessment.    Study design and participants  In this cross-sectional study, 304 women referred to 10 health care centers in Tehran, Iran were recruited from October 2016 to March 2017.

All health centers were located in the south of Tehran; no differences in socioeconomic status between these centers was observed. Women residing in Tehran with Iranian nationality who did not follow a specific diet were included. Exclusion criteria were as follows: a history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, liver or kidney disorders, cancer, pregnant and/or lactating women, and women who had total diet energy intake (kcal/day) outside the range of 800 to 4200 kcal/day. The Alternated Healthy Eating Index score was considered the main dependent variable for calculating the sample size (16).

All eligible participants signed written informed consents at the baseline.   Anthropometric assessment  Using a digital scale (Seca, Hamburg, Germany), weight was measured in minimally clothed participants without shoes. Height was measured using standard protocol with a tape measure. The body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight (kilograms) divided by squared height (m2). Waist circumference (WC) was measured at the narrowest circumference using an outstretched tape measure. Hip circumference was measured at the maximum circumference over light clothing with a precision of 0.1 cm. All measurements were taken by the same technician to limit observer error.",13b5d06f-81a7-4216-a5fb-01350d4a97d6

All items were converted to daily intake values to calculate total energy intake.   Calculation of dietary quality indices  dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) score: We calculated the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) score to check participants adherence to the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet based on foods and nutrients that were emphasized or summarized in the eight pillars of the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet: low intake of sodium, whole grains, sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages and processed and red meats, and a high intake of low-fat dairy products, nuts and legumes, fruits and vegetables.",cd3750a0-8a6d-4b3d-8f48-c7c592c96971

Similarly, a score of 4 was given to participants within the lowest quartile of red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, and sodium consumption and a score of 1 for participants with a high consumption of these food categories. The dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) score was calculated for each participant by the summation of scores from the eight components for a total dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) score within a range of 8 and 32.2   Dietary diversity score (DDS): The previously described method by Kant et al was used to calculate a Dietary diversity score (DDS) score.24 Briefly, five food groups (vegetables, bread and grains, meat, dairy, and fruit) were divided into twenty-three subgroups.",c07ed0d7-8bc9-4a1e-9d7e-560abb1f111f
10,methods6," A food item was considered a consumed when the participant had eaten at least one-half of a serving per day based on the food pyramid quantity. The score for each food group was calculated by the sum of subgroup category scores, and multiplied by 2. The total Dietary diversity score (DDS) ranged between 0 and 10.   dietary energy density (DED) score: The dietary energy density (DED) score was calculated by dividing each participant’s total energy intake by total grams of food per day. In consideration of the current ongoing debate whether to include or exclude beverages in the calculation of the dietary energy density (DED) score, we opted to exclude beverages and calculate the dietary energy density (DED) score as the sum of the weight of 154 foods (excluding beverages). Therefore, the effect of the dietary energy density (DED) score on body weight was attributed to food intake, and not beverages.",17e98393-4617-4dea-a000-a91c839ba6bb

After calculating the energy-adjusted amounts of the aforementioned food items using the residual method, participants were scored based on quintile. The score of 0 and 5 reflected the first and fifths quintiles, respectively.25 Scores from the 9 components were summated, and an AlternativeHealthy Eating Index (AHEI) score between 7 and 45 was obtained. A higher score represented a stricter adherence to the AlternativeHealthy Eating Index (AHEI) dietary eating pattern.",ad1269a8-08cb-413c-b35a-d09cb85f9ab2
12,methods8,"   nutrient adequacy ratio (NAR) and mean adequacy ratio (MAR) scores: Based on an individual’s intake of a nutrient as a percentage of the recommended intake expressed by the nutrient adequacy ratio (NAR), mean adequacy ratio (MAR) was estimated which outlines the overall nutritional adequacy of a population. nutrient adequacy ratio (NAR) was calculated by dividing the estimated daily individual intake of zinc, iron, calcium, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin B12, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, and vitamin A to their dietary reference intakes (DRIs) that are reported based on sex and age.12 Each nutrient adequacy ratio (NAR) score is summed and divided by the number of nutrients and multiplied by 100 to indicate the percentage of nutrients where the recommended intake is met.

Energy intake, age, educational level, and income were considered as control variables in multivariate analyses. Total energy intake was adjusted to ensure that observed associations were independent of participant’s energy intake. Most food and nutrient intakes were associated with total energy intake and therefore may affect the quality of food.26 Measurement error was reduced in data collection phase through the use of the self-reported dietary assessment. Age, educational level, and income were previously determined.27 There was no significant correlation between these covariates and diet quality, however it is possible that residual effects remain on observed outcomes.",5dc09a56-4104-48e3-86ef-a5bb6363c26f
