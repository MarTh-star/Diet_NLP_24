0,introduction0,"Cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) is the most common cause of death in the world and was estimated to account for 32% of all deaths in 2013 [1]. cardiovascular disease (CVD) is also a major concern for the United Kingdom (UK) in particular, with the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study showing that the leading cause of years of life lost in the UK was Ischaemic Heart Disease (ischemic heart disease (IHD)), followed by stroke as the third main cause [2]. A 2012 review found that cardiovascular disease (CVD) was responsible for 42,000 premature deaths (defined as deaths before the age of 75) in the UK and that it was the most common cause of death in women [3]. In addition to the cost to life, the health burden attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD) imposes costs on the healthcare system and the wider economy, with these costs estimated to have been £29.1 billion in 2004 [4].",88b6bda9-e0b1-4496-9b36-a6051d013e20
1,introduction1,"  The importance of dietary risk factors in causing cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been broadly accepted, with dietary modification now considered an integral component of a comprehensive, population-level cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention strategy [5]. The importance ascribed to individual nutrients in preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been diminished, replaced by an emphasis on foods and overall dietary patterns [6]. In two long term trials, a diet based around nutrient targets—specifically reduced fat intake—was found to be less effective at reducing risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events than a dietary pattern based around changing the consumption of whole foods [6–8]. Those diet patterns found to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have been focused on increased consumption of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, fish, nuts, dairy products and vegetable oils, and reduced consumption of processed meats, sugars and desserts, alcohol and fats [9].",8a2c11df-0dc9-45e3-a27d-d70896227ba0
2,introduction2,"  The dietary approaches to stop hypertension dietary pattern (or ‘dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet’) was developed in the 1990s and has many of the characteristics of a typical cardioprotective diet; it was first used in a controlled feeding trial, where it was found to be effective at reducing blood pressure [10]. The effectiveness of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet for reducing blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors was further supported by subsequent experimental evidence [11–16]. Observational studies have found an association between accordance to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and cardiovascular disease outcomes, both fatal and non-fatal, in studies from the USA, Italy and Sweden [17, 18]. However, to date no studies examining this relationship have been conducted in the UK and as such the effectiveness of the pattern at reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in the UK population is unknown.",fb466d08-2c1a-48c4-a625-517b05450d06
3,introduction3,"  Demonstrating the potential effectiveness of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet in different contexts is important, given that prospective epidemiological studies have typically characterised diets based on a relative measure of accordance with the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern [19–21]. For example, absolute intakes of some dietary components that have been used to assess dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) accordance, including milk, fruit juice, sugar-sweetened beverages and red meat, vary substantially among countries [22, 23]. Other important components of the diet differ too. For example, while sugar-sweetened beverages are the leading source of added sugars in the USA [24], table sugar, preserves, confectionary and grain-based foods are more important sources in the UK and other European countries [25].",31db1368-c237-4f95-83f6-6bd04328684b
4,introduction4," Studying the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)-cardiovascular disease (CVD) relationship in a UK cohort both adds to the international evidence base and provides UK-specific evidence that may be particularly valuable if the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet were ever to be considered as a possible exemplar diet for use in UK public health messaging.  This study examined the relationship between the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern, incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a prospective cohort from the East of England, with the aim of determining whether or not accordance with this dietary pattern is associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in the UK.",d7199a60-e9bf-443f-a370-11bda28313f1
5,introduction5, The hypothesis was that increased accordance to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet would be associated with lower risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. ,acd8c81c-f8ca-4764-b3fe-a778a3623145

The total EPIC-Norfolk cohort was found to be similar to the wider English population in 1993 in terms of height, weight, BMI, systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol [26]. Further details about the EPIC-Norfolk cohort have been published by Day et al. [26].  Dietary assessment The typical food intake of study participants was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire adapted from an food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) originally used in the Nurse’s Health Study, which has been adapted and validated for use in the UK [27].",c76069b3-eb80-4b52-8492-16c7e8b0be7e
10,methods4," This food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) contains 130 line items and asks participants about the frequency at which they consumed each item across the previous year, from never or less than once per month to six or more times per day. Full details about this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and how it was developed have been published previously by Welch et al. [28]. Estimated intake of each food or food group consumed was calculated using the FETA program, which combines the frequency of consumption reported in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with standardised portion data to estimate the intake of macro- and micro-nutrients [29].

This method is based on an individual’s consumption of six food groups and two nutrients. Of these, five—fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes, whole grains, and low-fat dairy—are encouraged and three—red and processed meats, salt, and non-milk extrinsic sugars (NMES)—are discouraged.  The energy-adjusted consumption of each of these groups was calculated using the residual method, previously described by Willett [30]. For the five encouraged food groups the quintile is the individual’s score for that group, I.E.",4d7214e6-3654-4541-bd94-a6950ccf8980
12,methods6,", those who consume the most are in quintile five and would have a score of five (the highest score), and for the three discouraged groups this is inverted so that the greatest consumers have a score of one. The quintile scores for all eight groups are summed to produce a measure of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) accordance that has a potential range of 8–40, with higher scores indicating that the individual’s diet is in greater accordance with the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet pattern. This score is then divided into five quintiles (range in this study: 9–19, 20–23, 24–25, 26–29, 30–38), so that Quintile 5 contained those people with the most dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)-accordant diets.",2083f146-6bbe-4da8-8d5c-138106ad18c4

The estimate of a 12% lower risk found here is smaller than the 20% reduction found in that meta-analysis but the majority of studies used in the meta-analysis only contained women, and several studies were based on occupational cohorts, which is likely to reduce the absolute risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the sample when compared to a population-based sample of older men and women like the one used here. The dominant study in the meta-analysis was completed by Fung et al. based on an occupational cohort of women from the USA.",47fd2775-ada8-487b-bb29-f0f7cf1fed34
28,discussion2," The absolute risk of incident ischemic heart disease (IHD) observed in the lowest quintile of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) accordance in that cohort was 165 cases per 100,000 person-years, in contrast to 1262 cases per 100,000 person-years in the present study [19]. The greater overall risk in this cohort may result in an apparent weaker association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dietary risk factors. Rothman’s Sufficient-Component Cause model [35] stated that a given disease outcome may have multiple causes that are each sufficient to cause disease, with only some being necessary. Since dietary risk factors are not a necessary cause for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, a high level of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in this sample may reflect a lower relative contribution of diet compared to other risk factors (particularly age-related factors), making the association between this measure of diet and cardiovascular disease (CVD) less detectable.",0f86ebf2-95db-4ecd-9346-b691c1906a1d
29,discussion3," Given this, the difference in sample characteristics may explain the difference in the magnitude of the association between that found by Salehi-Abargouei et al. and the present study.  This meta-analysis of Salehi-Abargouei et al. did not report the same distinction between ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke as shown here, with the pooled results showing a significant reduction in risk for both incident Stroke and incident ischemic heart disease (IHD). That meta-analysis was pooled from three studies, of which only one found a significant association and this was conducted by Fung et al. [19]. The Fung et al. study was much larger (n = 88,517) than either the present study or the two others included in the meta-analysis, which may have been the cause of reduced uncertainty around the estimate and the significant result they report for that outcome.",19298434-a058-4932-bc68-469a69c6e822
30,discussion4," However, the lower risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) associated with dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) observed here was only 10%, less than the 21% observed in the meta-analysis, so both the scale of the reduction and lack of significance is at odds with that observed there.  The finding that increased accordance to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality is in accordance with the findings of previous studies, all of which used samples from the USA [21, 36, 37]. Given the concordance between these studies and the present findings, both in direction and magnitude of the association observed, it is probable that the results presented here are true findings.",6eba5570-b0ab-40ae-8e37-f9870f7b8da7
31,discussion5," Furthermore, the specificity of the association between dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) accordance and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality (but not non-cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality) suggests biological plausibility and reduces our concern that these associations were the result of residual confounding by unmeasured social, behavioural or clinical risk factors.  The association observed between the third quintile of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) accordance and both incident ischemic heart disease (IHD) and non-cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, yet not any other quintile of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) accordance with these outcomes, is harder to interpret.

Limitations and methodological considerations The main limitation of this study stems from the use of self-reported dietary data. This method is subjective and vulnerable to both random and systematic error, with the potential to lead to misclassification bias [38].",e97757d7-dc4d-4ae1-ba00-80132ac9fa8d
33,discussion7," This could result from random error, which would bias the results towards the null and attenuate any real association, or it could be driven by social desirability bias, where intakes of healthier foods are overstated while intakes of less-healthy foods are under-reported [39]. However, with no knowledge of how social desirability is distributed across the sample, it is not possible to meaningfully comment on the direction or magnitude that this may have on the results reported here. It is plausible that obese participants were more likely to selectively underreport dietary intakes, as this has been shown in previous studies [40], which could have led to differential misclassification of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) accordance based on obesity. However, it should be noted that limitations of this nature affect all subjective methods of dietary assessment, so this should not limit the comparability of these results to those of other studies.",64e067af-c24e-4fd1-a246-1ea7eac578f8
34,discussion8," We excluded approximately 7% of the sample, mainly due to lack of dietary or covariate information. The excluded participants had characteristics associated with elevated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk: older, more likely to smoke, and with higher blood pressure. This exclusion likely biased our results in a way that attenuated the associations we observed, since these individuals would have likely consumed less dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)-accordant diets and would have been at higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although the cohort design allows the observation of a temporal relationship between the exposure and outcome, it is still an observational design and is therefore susceptible to residual confounding, although the direction or magnitude of any such effect is not known.",4ba61bb6-4d18-4113-a187-92fbd19a5381
35,discussion9,"  This study has a number of strengths, including its large sample size, prospective design, basis in the general population, independent assessment of outcome events, and a broad range of available factors to include as covariates. The ascertainment of dietary exposures and covariate data at the start of the study eliminates potential recall bias that would affect retrospective study designs. The use of administrative records to identify outcomes minimizes loss to follow-up and ascertainment bias. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to examine the association between dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) accordance and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the UK.  Generalisability The generalisability of these results may be affected by the age of the study sample, which is older than the general UK population.",f320082f-6a39-4af4-81e5-32b9612f99d7
36,discussion10," However, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events are more likely to occur in people aged over 40 years, meaning that this sample represents an important population in which to assess the effectiveness of a diet intended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Adjustment for possible confounding factors means that the results presented here can be compared to those of cohorts with a different distribution of these factors, allowing for its inclusion in future meta-analyses. As stated previously, at the time the EPIC-Norfolk study began, this cohort was similar to the wider UK population in terms of key risk factors, including height, weight, blood pressure and total cholesterol, which lends support to the external validity of the results presented here.  Implications for public health The epidemiological evidence presented here adds to a well-established literature on the importance of diet for prevention of chronic disease.",d1fbf454-d3b2-4282-873c-85e161259829
37,discussion11," In both the UK and USA, dietary recommendations are part of government strategy for population-level health promotion. However the uptake of dietary guidance and the adoption of healthier eating habits in the population may be hindered by a number of behavioral and social factors. Studies have suggested that healthy eating depends on food literacy and nutrition knowledge [41], cooking [42, 43], and the availability of time to spend in food preparation [44], and the eating habits of family, friends and peers [45, 46]. The cost of food and neighborhood food access may also be important in particular for the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet.",ef1d13f1-cd64-41b8-9d62-61d63bf482d7
38,discussion12," Research in the UK and USA indicate that dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) accordant diets tend to cost more than less-healthy diets [31, 47, 48] and studies from the UK and Ireland have found that living in closer proximity to supermarkets may enable dietary habits that are congruent with the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) pattern [48, 49]. Given the balance of evidence, the promotion of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) and other cardioprotective diets needs to be matched with both population- and individual-level interventions to support the uptake of healthy eating.  Conclusion This study has shown that the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet pattern is associated with significantly lower risk of incident stroke, incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, consistent with previous studies conducted mainly in the USA.",8e904d58-6caf-4aec-997c-fe2ff7de5fcf
39,discussion13," The results presented here indicate that the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern does have relevance for the UK population and can be used as a salient measure of a cardioprotective diet. As such it could have a role in future dietary public health promotion strategies.
