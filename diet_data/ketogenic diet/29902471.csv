However, given the low Dichloroacetate (DCA)‐activated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity in lymphocytes and fibroblasts of the patient reported here (Table 1), the decision was made to use KD as the preferable therapeutic intervention for this patient and follow clinical response.",ba8ebfa4-45c5-4105-b8f9-17371e11ac13

18,discussion7," The composite activity of the mitochondrial pyruvate transporter, production of acetyl‐CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), coupled production of NADH, and oxidation of the NADH by Complex I in intact cellular mitochondria was normal (Table 1). Another metric for activation deficiency due to pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) deficiency is to observe limited or no change between inactivated (+F; “minimum”) and activated (+Dichloroacetate (DCA); “maximum”) pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activities, with a ratio of 1 representing no change (experience at Center for Inherited Disorders of Energy Metabolism (CIDEM) has been that the minimum pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity constitutes about 30% to 40% of maximum activity in normal individuals). This is noted in lymphocytes but not in fibroblasts of the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) deficient patient here where the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) inactivated to activated ratio was 0.93 (0.",b4afaf82-eb42-480e-932c-2c06945fe459

The basis for this difference between lymphocytes and fibroblasts is unclear.  The regulatory enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) kinase and phosphatase are believed to be specific for pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), and to the best of our knowledge, there is not an analogous regulatory function for KDC. This is supported by the observation of normal KDC activity in this proband in fibroblasts with biallelic pathogenic pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP)1 mutations (Table 1) as well as in fibroblasts of other reported cases with defective pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP)1 where flux through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was unaffected by the low “native” pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity (Table 2).",8f92e09a-586c-4aac-a51d-fd0939e72ddc
20,discussion9,"9 Interestingly, the proband reported here also had low branched‐chain 2‐ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) activity in fibroblasts (Table 1) with slight elevation of branched‐chain amino acids in plasma without allo‐isoleucine detected and ketoacids in urine, which we speculate might suggest shared regulatory function of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and branched‐chain 2‐ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) by pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP)1 at least in fibroblasts but possibly in other tissues or cell types as well. Sequencing and deletion/duplication analyses of branched‐chain 2‐ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH)A (on Chr 19), the most common gene mutated in maple syrup urine disease, as well as branched‐chain 2‐ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH)B (on Chr 6), DBT (on Chr 1), and PPM1K (on Chr 4) were all normal (data not shown).",df0195e7-44e1-45d0-a5a6-4bef79c24afa
21,discussion10," Similar to pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) regulation, branched‐chain 2‐ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) activity is regulated posttranscriptionally by phosphorylation (inactivation) and dephosphorylation (activation).40, 41 The branched‐chain 2‐ketoacid dehydrogenase phosphatase (branched‐chain 2‐ketoacid dehydrogenase phosphatase (BDP)) encoded by PPM1K is a manganese (Mn+2)‐dependent branched‐chain 2‐ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex phosphatase and not a magnesium‐ or calcium‐dependent enzyme.42 Furthermore, in contrast to pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP)1c, branched‐chain 2‐ketoacid dehydrogenase phosphatase (BDP) functions as a monomer and the lipoyl prosthetic group on the E2 subunit of branched‐chain 2‐ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) is not essential for branched‐chain 2‐ketoacid dehydrogenase phosphatase (BDP) binding or E2‐stimulated phosphatase activity.42 The ~16.",ac2ccf41-20e0-4432-b65d-6d63ec447b78

However, we cannot completely rule out the impact of other functionally uncharacterized genes, miRNA or pseudogenes within the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) region on branched‐chain 2‐ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) activity.
