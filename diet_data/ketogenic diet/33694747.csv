0,methods0," 2.1. Animals  To establish an animal DN model, male C57BLKS/J lar-Leprdb/Leprdb mice (5 weeks old, n = 27) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Mice were fed normal chow diet for 2 weeks for acclimation. When random glucose level exceeded 250 mg/dL, mice were randomly assigned into three groups, dbNCD, dbHFD, and dbKETO, according to the type of diet. dbNCD mice were fed normal chow diet, the composition of which, expressed as % of total kcal, is 55% carbohydrate, 25% protein, and 20% fat. dbHFD mice were fed a high-fat diet, the composition of which is 35% carbohydrate, 20% protein, and 45% fat. dbKETO mice were fed KD, the composition of which is 10% carbohydrate, 10% protein, and 80% fat. dbNCD and dbHFD were used as control groups since the aim of the current study was to determine the effect of 3-OHB on diabetic nephropathy. KD was synthesized according to the previous report [20].",36e1f5f1-7b9c-4b6f-a673-d62d8b23b26e
1,methods1," In brief, 200 g of ground standard chow diet was mixed with 50 mL of (+)-1,3-butanediol (B84785, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and shaken to form round pellets. Normal chow and high-fat diets do not contain (±)-1,3-butanediol. Body weight and fasting glucose were measured once a week. Twenty-four-hour urine was obtained 7 weeks after differential diet feeding using a metabolic cage (Jeung Do Bio & Plant Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea). Mice were sacrificed at 12 weeks after differential diet feeding. The overall experimental procedure is illustrated in Figure 1.

2,methods2," Indirect Calorimetry and Body Composition  Oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), respiratory exchange ratios (respiratory exchange ratios (RER)), and energy expenditure were measured using an indirect calorimetry system PHENOMASTER (TSE System, Bad Homburg, Germany). Mice were maintained in each chamber at a constant environmental temperature of 22 °C. Lean body mass was assessed by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Bruker BioSpin) and energy expenditure was calculated per lean body mass (kcal/h/kg lean body mass).  2.3. Immunohistochemistry (Immunohistochemistry (IHC)) Analyses  Tissue samples were fixed in paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and then cut into 4 μm thick sections. Sections were dried at 60 °C for 30 min and then deparaffinized with 3 washes of xylene for 5 min each. Sections were then rehydrated in graded alcohols, followed by incubation in 30% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min.

Next, slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with carboxymethyl lysine (carboxymethyl lysine (CML), 1:50, Abcam, CA, USA), CD68 (Abcam, 1:50, CA, USA), LC3A/B (1:50, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, UK) antibodies. Additionally, sections were incubated with secondary antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature followed by staining with diaminobenzidine chromogen (Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) and counterstaining with hematoxylin. Stained sections were examined under light microscopy. Mesangial areas were quantified using a light microscope equipped with an imaging system (aMRc5, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).  2.4. Electron Microscopy (EM) Analyses  Kidney tissues were fixed in sodium cacodylate buffer for 2 h followed by washing three times and post-fixation with 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 h.

Blood Chemistry and Urine Analysis  Blood glucose levels were measured by tail vein prick and glucometer (Accu-Chek Active, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Creatinine in urine was determined using the Quantichrome Urea Assay Kit (BioAssay System, Hayward, CA, USA). Urine albumin kit was measured using AssayPro (St. Charles, MO, USA).  2.6. Cell Culture  Human proximal tubular cell line HK-2 was cultured in RPMI 1640 or DMEM with low glucose concentration (5.5 mM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum (FBS)) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA).

Real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). The PCR reaction consisted of 10 μL of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 0.5 μL of 10 pmol/μL forward and reverse primers, 7 μL of water, and 2 μL of template cDNA in a total volume of 20 μL. Samples were assayed on a Light Cycler® 96 (Roche, Germany) instrument.  2.8. Western Blot Analysis  Homogenized kidney tissues and lysed cell samples were boiled for 7 min with a gel-loading buffer (pH 6.8, 125 mM Tris-HCL, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)), 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% bromophenol blue).

6,methods6," Gels were subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). The membrane was placed in a blocking solution containing 5% skim milk with TBS-Tween (TBS-T) at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Additionally, the membrane was washed for 30 min in TBS-T buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature. Protein bands were detected by Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Boston, MA, USA).

Reactive Oxygen Species (reactive oxygen species (ROS))  The amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by the formation of fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA)). dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) was added to cells followed by incubation for 30 min. Cells were then suspended in the media after washing with PBS solution.",94aff6f3-24a8-46f6-8904-2bf3b4c5d07b

Image J (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij, accessed on 24 January 2022) was used to quantify densities of figures.  2.11. Statistical Analysis  Experiments were repeated at least three times to gain consistent results. A one-way analysis of variance (A one way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) was performed. Shapiro–Wilk statistics were used to verify the normal distribution, and Levene statistics were used to determine the homogeneity of variance. A Tukey test was undertaken for post hoc multiple comparisons. Student’s t-test was performed, and data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. In the non-normal distribution, a Kruskal–Wallis test was completed. The Statistical Package for the Social Science (Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS)) version 18.0 (Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used.",933dbaab-8e89-4222-9cca-f0f1406814ae
9,methods9," The results were statistically significant at less than 0.05 of p value.  3. Results  3.1. KD Delays DN-Related Pathological Changes  Body weights in the dbKETO group were lower than in dbNCD and dbHFD groups throughout the entire experimental period (Figure 2A). Fasting blood glucose level was higher in the dbKETO group at 9 weeks. However, fasting glucose levels at 12 and 16 weeks were not different among three groups (Figure 2B). Notably, urinary albumin to creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine ratios, representative markers for renal functions, were lower in dbKETO than in dbNCD and dbHFD groups (Figure 2C,D). Immunohistochemical analyses (PAS, Sirius red, and trichrome) revealed decreased fibrotic changes in dbKETO compared with dbNCD and dbHFD groups (Figure 2E). Ultrastructural analysis using electron microscopy showed mild mesangial expansions in dbNCD and moderate mesangial expansion along with cellular proliferation in dbHFD.",5f9844ea-fcbf-4ced-b19f-4d742507fee7
10,methods10," However, no pathological changes in mesangial structures were observed in dbKETO (Figure 2G). Quantification of mesangial area also supports ultrastructural analysis of mesangium, showing increased mesangial areas in dbNCD and dbHFD groups (Figure 2F). Histologic analysis of carboxymethyl lysine (CML), a marker for advanced glycation end products, was also performed to determine the degree of the adverse effects of hyperglycemia (Figure 2H). Indeed, we observed that the level of carboxymethyl lysine (CML) in dbKETO was lower than in dbNCD and dbHFD.  3.2. KD Attenuates respiratory exchange ratios (RER) and Increases Energy Expenditure  To elucidate possible metabolic alterations in dbKETO, we conducted an additional experiment, the metabolic cage analysis, to determine the utilization of O2 and CO2 in the experimental groups (Figure 3). An respiratory exchange ratios (RER) value near 0.7 indicates that fat is predominantly used as a fuel source.",991913f8-cac2-4ff2-ae3e-d7175820896c
11,methods11," Metabolic cage analysis revealed more fat-dominant oxidation in dbKETO than in dbNCD since the average respiratory exchange ratios (RER) value in dbKETO was 0.72 and in dbNCD 0.79. The dbKETO group consumed higher O2 and produced more CO2 than the dbNCD group (Figure 3A,B). Notably, we also found that energy expenditure per lean body mass in dbKETO group was higher than that in the dbNCD group (Figure 3E).  3.3. KD Increases Autophagy in db/db Mice  Increased energy expenditure in the dbKETO group prompted us to explore the possibility of 3-OHB to stimulate energy expenditure through regulating autophagy, the process of cellular self-eating.",25d63e42-f567-4817-86b2-a83f7b44fbab
12,methods12," Given that the kidney has the second highest oxygen consumption after the heart and the proximal tubules require more energy than others since they reabsorb 80% of the filtrate that passes through the glomerulus [21] and the recently elucidated role of autophagy in energy metabolism [21,22], we hypothesized that 3-OHB stimulates autophagy in the kidney that might delay the pathologic progression of DM nephropathy. We tested our hypothesis first by determining molecules in the autophagic pathway in the kidney tissues. Additionally, we found that expression of LC3 (Map1lc3a), p62 (Sqstm1), and beclin (Atg6) was increased in the dbKETO group as compared to other experimental groups (Figure 4A). Consistently, Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of LC3 also revealed increased expression of LC3 in the dbKETO group (Figure 4B).  3.4.",f51418bc-7a10-426b-a426-41fdab2ff83e
13,methods13," 3-OHB Increases Autophagy in Renal Proximal Tubular Cells  To elucidate further the mechanistic details of the effect of KD on the kidney function, we performed an in vitro study using the human proximal tubule cell line HK-2 cells. 3-OHB treatment increased LC3I to LC3II ratios in non-serum starved HK-2 cells at 2 and 8 h (Figure 5A). Additionally, 3-OHB treatment increased phosphorylation level of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK, Prkaa) and beclin, markers of autophagy (Figure 5B). Furthermore, we observed that 3-OHB accelerates the degradation of p62 evidenced by the decreased expression of p62 after 12, 24, and 48 h of 3-OHB treatment (Figure 5C). With the previous studies that revealed that 3-OHB is an endogenous histone deacetylase (histone deacetylase (HDAC)) inhibitor [9] and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors activate autophagy in proximal tubular cells [23], we next determined the expression levels of histone deacetylase (HDAC)1, 2, and 3 in 3-OHB treated HK-2 cells.",c9081c97-d48d-437e-8883-e0370fdcf1db
14,methods14," Contrary to our expectation, we found that 3-OHB treatment did not change the expression levels of HDCA1, 2, and 3 (Figure 5D).  3.5. 3-OHB Increases National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)2 Expression in Renal Proximal Tubular Cells  Previous studies indicate that 3-OHB exerts an antioxidative response [9]. To further investigate the underlying mechanism of 3-OHB in stimulating autophagy, we determined the level of National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)2 (Nfe2l2), a transcription factor that activates expression of antioxidant enzymes and a molecule that is involved in both autophagy and antioxidant response [24]. Expectantly, we observed that 3-OHB increased expression levels of both National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)2 mRNA and protein (Figure 6A,B). Immunofluorescent analysis also indicated increased National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)2 expression in the nucleus of 3-OHB-treated HK-2 cells (Figure 6C).  3.6.",3e5c3857-a4ab-47e4-88ce-f33d36c1ea3d
15,methods15," KD and 3-OHB Decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) Production  reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in the kidney of dbKETO was lower than dbNCD and dbHFD groups (Figure 7A). Moreover, CD68, a marker for circulating macrophages, also decreased in the dbKETO group compared with dbNCD and dbHFD groups, implicating attenuated inflammatory processes in the dbKETO group (Figure 7B). We then examined the effect of 3-OHB on high glucose (25, 30, and 45 mM)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HK-2 cells and found 3-OHB markedly reduced high glucose-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Figure 7C,D).  4. Discussion  In the current study, we demonstrated in vitro that 3-OHB, a major ketone body quantitatively and qualitatively, stimulates autophagy and attenuates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in renal proximal tubular cells.",37b24ed8-99f7-4755-a956-1188ca1024d2
16,methods16," We also showed in vivo that KD ameliorates DN-related pathological change in db/db mice possibly via activation of autophagy and suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.  Treating patients with DN is challenging. DN is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (end stage renal disease (ESRD)) in most developed countries accounting for 50% of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in the Republic of Korea [25]. The presence of DN doubles the risk for diabetes associated all-cause mortality as compared with the absence of DN [26]. Evidence indicates that intensive glycemic control in patients with DN poses a 41% increase in cardiovascular mortality and a 31% increase in all-cause mortality [26]. This might be due to 4–5 times higher incidence of severe hypoglycemia, a side effect of intensive glycemic control [27]. Randomized controlled studies also show that severe hypoglycemia predicts later mortality [28,29,30].",d3d26574-290b-457a-9433-625e3d09f8c1
17,methods17,"  DN is characterized by persistent albuminuria and decreased glomerular filtration rate. Glomerulosclerosis, mesangial expansion, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis are the typical features of DN. In the current study, we showed that 3-OHB attenuates the pathological features of DN, fibrosis, and albuminuria as well as blood urea nitrogen (BUN). These results support those of a previous study that showed reversal of DN by KD by Poplawski et al. [19]. In the current study, the fasting glucose level in dbKETO remained unchanged and body weights decreased while in the study of Poplawski et al., the fasting glucose level decreased and body weight remained unchanged. These differences could be due to the usage of different precursors for 3-OHB. We used 1,3-butanediol as a precursor for 3-OHB while the study of Poplawski et al. used commercially available KD in which lard, butter, and corn oil were used.",dc7eecd4-e20d-404c-9c05-6aa991db723c
18,methods18," In support of our reasoning, evidence showed decreased body weight and increased energy expenditure in 1,3-butanediol-fed mice compared to control mice [10]. Other possibilities that could account for the difference in fasting glucose are plasma 3-OHB level and progression of DN [19]. Although we did not measure plasma 3-OHB level, studies showed 1,3-butanediol KD increases plasma 3-OHB level to 0.51–1 mM in C57BL/6-based mice strains [10,20], which is lower than plasma 3-OHB level (1.8~2.3 mM) in the study of Poplawski et al. Additionally, in the current study, we observed more profound histological findings of DN than those in the study of Poplawski et al., which could affect the regulatory role of 3-OHB on plasma glucose level.  Interesting but not unexpected is that energy expenditures per lean body mass in the dbKETO group are considerably higher than those in the dbNCD group.",bb019351-ec0b-4910-80ec-ca90a6b16443
19,methods19," We reasoned that increased energy expenditure might be linked to activation of autophagy based on the results of a previous study that showed that increased energy expenditure impacts autophagy [31].  The pathophysiology of DN, how DM progresses into DN, is still elusive. Since glomerulus is the primary site of diabetic injury and glomerular hypertrophy and podocyte loss are hallmarks of DN, many studies have focused on the function of the glomerulus in relation to podocytes. Recently, however, studies that emphasize the tubular functions in regulating glomerular filtration have emerged [32,33,34]. This theory explains that DN may develop in relation to tubular dysfunction in regulating glomerular filtration [35]. Additionally, this alternative theory provides a convincing explanation for the therapeutic effects of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, the only proven disease-modifying treatments for DN.",70c92b88-449c-483e-81b3-0e761cae3a3f
20,methods20,"  With this above-referenced evidence, we employed in the current study human proximal tubule cells, HK-2, to evaluate the potential therapeutic effect of 3-OHB in the treatment of DN. Maintaining basal level of autophagy is essential for renal homeostasis [36]. Additionally, impaired autophagy is observed in high glucose-treated proximal tubular cells, mice models of DN, and kidney tissue samples of human DN [37]. Dysregulated autophagy contributes to the progression of DN [38]. We showed in this study that 3-OHB augments the flow of autophagy in an in vitro model. We observed that the rate of degradation of p62 is faster than that of control in HK-2 cells. We also showed that 3-OHB stimulates autophagy in vivo. We found significantly increased levels of p62 and LC3 in the kidney of the dbKETO group. These results implicate the autophagy-mediated effect of 3-OHB on the delayed progression of DN.",57663190-6d30-4b6f-977d-ead5e74d8cfc
21,methods21,"  P62, also known as sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), is a protein that binds ubiquitylated proteins and delivers them to autophagosomes. One of the proteins that is delivered to the autophagosome by p62 is Keap 1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein that guides National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)2 to ubiquitin-mediated proteosomal degradation [24]. Given that 3-OHB stimulates the expression of p62, we explored the possibility of increased p62 to sequester Keap 1 and leave National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)2 unubiquitylated. Indeed, we observed an increased level of National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)2 and consequently decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in 3-OHB-treated HK-2 cells.  3-OHB is an endogenous histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and evidence indicated that 3-OHB exerts a protective effect against oxidative stress via selective depletion of histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 and histone deacetylase (HDAC)2 [9].",6dad2601-94b6-4f42-97fb-cd2c1f730617
22,methods22," Thus, we determined the possible inhibitory effect of 3-OHB on the expression of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and, to our surprise, found that the expression levels of histone deacetylase (HDAC)1, histone deacetylase (HDAC)2, histone deacetylase (HDAC)3, and histone deacetylase (HDAC)6 did not change. This result suggests that in renal proximal tubular cells, 3-OHB does not function as an endogenous histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. However, since other histone deacetylase (HDAC)s (histone deacetylase (HDAC)4, histone deacetylase (HDAC)5, and histone deacetylase (HDAC)s7 through 11) were not examined in this study, the possibility that other histone deacetylase (HDAC)s might be inhibited by 3-OHB cannot be ruled out.  5. Conclusions  In summary, we showed the potential therapeutic usage of 3-OHB in the treatment of DN.",bad13d89-cf40-4b4b-9ab8-9c5400b16ada
23,methods23," KD attenuates albuminuria and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and fibrosis, characteristic features of DN and 3-OHB stimulates autophagy and mitigates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in renal proximal tubular cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show a stimulatory effect of 3-OHB on autophagy in the kidney, an effect that might be linked to the protective effect of 3-OHB against the progression of DN. Further studies to evaluate the efficacy and underlying mechanistic details of 3-OHB for other renal diseases, including acute kidney injury and glomerulonephritis, will be of great merit for further scientific understanding and clinical translation.
