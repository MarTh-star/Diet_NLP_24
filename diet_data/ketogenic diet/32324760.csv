0,introduction0," Breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide, with nearly 2.1 million new patients diagnosed in 2018 globally [1]. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide (627,000 deaths) and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women [1]. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with several biologically distinct subtypes. In general, it includes the following three biological subgroups: (1) immunohistochemical expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), (2) amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) (with or without ER expression), and (3) cancers that do not express ER and HER2 or the progesterone receptor (PR). Despite improvements in technology for early detection, approximately 5% - 7% of women diagnosed with breast cancer have metastatic disease at the time of the first presentation.",f5f8f62a-0ec5-45f6-ba3d-ca3f0f3e42d3
1,introduction1," Additionally, approximately 30% of women initially diagnosed with early-stage, nonmetastatic breast cancer later develop distant metastatic disease despite treatment.  The treatment strategy for breast cancer differs according to the histological type, tumor grade, tumor biology, stage of disease, and clinical factors. Typically, treatment includes a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, endocrine therapy, and chemotherapy. Most women with early-stage breast cancer generally receive local therapies that involve surgery with or without subsequent radiotherapy. Adjuvant systemic therapy is often prescribed to minimize the risk of recurrence. Currently, the mainstay of treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer involves systemic therapies comprising of chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and/or biological therapies together with supportive medical care.",c98c3567-9b20-489e-b90e-1154c6f2d46e
2,introduction2,"  In the past few decades, there have been some advancements in the systemic treatment of breast cancer, including new cytotoxic therapies, endocrine therapies, and therapies targeting HER2. Despite these additional treatment options, the median overall survival (OS) for patients with metastatic breast cancer remains low at approximately three years. Unfortunately, survival may not exceed a few months in some cases of aggressive disease [2].  Warburg originally found that aerobic fermentation is a common feature of most cancers [3]. His observation has been confirmed in most malignant cancers and is now referred to as the “Warburg effect.” Metabolic dysregulation in cancer cells is most often characterized by glucose dependency and increased lactate production. Both alterations have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction [4-5].",1d06506f-1e0c-4ceb-bff4-c745b2a73b31
3,introduction3," This abnormal energy metabolism is evident in fluorodeoxyglucose (fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG))-positron emission tomography (positron emission tomography (PET)) scans, the preferred imaging technique essential to the diagnosis and follow-up protocols used in most systemic cancers, including breast cancer.  Recently, several studies have focused on targeting metabolic aberrations specific to cancer cells, leading to the development of novel chemotherapy applications, namely, metabolically supported chemotherapy (metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT)) [6-12]. In practice, metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT) follows a 14-hour fast starting in the previous evening and administration of pharmaceutical doses of regular insulin prior to the administration of chemotherapy.",f10db3d3-da6e-4a72-838d-1ce4b4c87dff
4,introduction4," This strategy aims to increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs through the following two mechanisms: inducing mild hypoglycemia, leading to acute metabolic stress in cancer cells, and increasing membrane permeability. This is a novel application of chemotherapy that exploits metabolic weakness in cancer cells directly before the application of chemotherapeutic drugs. Because mutations are known to reduce metabolic flexibility in cancer cells, this added stressor can enhance the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy [13]. The glucose dependency of cancer cells also forms the rationale for adopting a diet that decreases circulating glucose levels. A high-fat, carbohydrate-restricted ketogenic diet (KD) reduces blood glucose levels while simultaneously increasing blood ketone levels.",a6ae6e64-573d-49c9-b072-b55dd4a85e6e
5,introduction5," Importantly, ketone bodies serve as an alternative energy metabolite to glucose in normal cells but not in cancer cells due to abnormalities in the number, structure, and function of cancer cell mitochondria [14]. Proper administration of a KD can be therapeutic for any cancer that has upregulated the use of glucose for energy [8-13, 15].  Other metabolic treatment modalities also show great potential when used concurrently with KD and metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT). Hyperthermia (HT) has a direct cytotoxic effect, exploiting the heat sensitivity of cancer cells by increasing the treated tissue temperature to 42°C or higher. HT may also increase the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy by sensitizing cancer cells to these therapies [7-12, 16]. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)) may target cancer cells by increasing oxidative stress.",2932496c-179a-439b-9ffc-80bc5cd963dc
6,introduction6," Tumor hypoxia increases the glycolytic dependence of cancer cells while promoting resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The unfavorable consequences of hypoxia may be counteracted by the administration of oxygen at elevated pressures, resulting in better tissue oxygenation [17]. hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) increases oxidative stress specifically in tumor cells; when used in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, it enhances therapeutic efficacy in various malignancies [8-12, 16, 18].  Based on this supporting evidence, we hypothesized that metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT), KD, HT, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) could be effectively combined to target several overlapping metabolic pathways and vulnerabilities of cancer cells. Herein, we describe a case of end-stage metastatic breast cancer where the patient was considered ineligible for the continued standard of care treatment.",05b1f496-9480-42e8-b045-dce835a08487
7,introduction7," We show that this patient achieved a complete and durable response to metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT).  Case presentation  A 45-year-old premenopausal woman with no identified comorbidities noticed a right breast mass in late 2016, which was subsequently evaluated and ruled out as a cyst by a medical doctor during consultation. At that time, she weighed 54 kg with a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) of 22.5 kg/m2.  In May 2017, she was treated for a skin ulceration in the cyst region of her right breast at a hospital near her home in Ohio, USA. The cyst was drained and found to be infected with Staphylococcus aureus. She also displayed a palpable nodule near the skin lesion. A bilateral mammogram on May 4, 2017 identified a 1.6-cm mass in the right medial breast with skin tethering. Bilateral breast ultrasound identified masses in both breasts and an enlarged right axillary lymph node.",c129aaf7-2f1b-4337-ad8b-fd1cc04eb715
8,introduction8," A punch biopsy of the skin lesion was performed on May 11, 2017, which demonstrated a grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma involving the dermis, epidermis, and dermal lymphatic spaces. ER and PR were strongly positive (> 95%), and HER2 was negative on immunohistochemistry (1+). The patient received antibiotics for her infection and was offered conventional chemotherapy, which she refused because of the chemotherapy’s potential for side effects and toxicity. In March 2018, following clinical and radiological confirmation of disease progression, she received radiotherapy at the University of California, Los Angeles for local disease control. Subsequent evaluation in June 2018 using whole-body (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (positron emission tomography (PET)-CT) scan identified widespread metastatic disease.",7b99547f-4af3-435e-aa0d-2eb06cbbb89e
9,introduction9, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymphadenopathy (lymphadenopathy (LAP)) was detected in the lower-left neck and supraclavicular region. Locally advanced breast cancer was suggested based on the findings of a large ulcerative lesion with intense hypermetabolism in irregular soft tissue thickening involving the medial aspect of both breasts. Involvement of the right adjacent pectoral musculature and direct invasion of the sternum were the areas of concern. The possibility of superimposed inflammatory/infectious processes (including osteomyelitis of the sternum) and postradiation changes were also considered. Numerous other fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lesions in both breasts and soft tissues of the chest wall were suspected to be metastases and/or multifocal primary lesions. Multiple fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid pulmonary (and possibly pleural) metastases and extensive metastatic lymphadenopathy (LAP) were also detected.,a9629e3d-7368-4cc6-b656-ad378afabde8
10,introduction10," Multiple fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid metastatic liver lesions and portacaval adenopathy were identified in the abdomen and pelvis, along with multifocal osseous metastases in the axial and appendicular skeleton. In July 2018, a new ultrasound-guided core biopsy was performed on the left breast axillary, which further documented widespread metastatic disease. Evidence of grade 2 invasive mammary carcinoma (ER (+), PR (+), and HER2 (-)) with mixed ductal and lobular features was consistent with her initial biopsy from May 2017. A follow-up CT scan in August 2018 confirmed significant and wide interval progression of metastatic disease at multiple pre-identified sites. An interval increase in the size of the pericardial effusion caused narrowing of both atria, particularly the left atria. Following this dismal report, the patient underwent echocardiography to assess tamponade physiology, which was reported to correlate with the positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan findings.",9ccb4799-7eb4-4ac6-acb9-86709d31e071
11,introduction11," Pericardiocentesis was performed with subsequent drainage of 360-mL of serosanguinous fluid. The patient was subsequently considered ineligible for further conventional therapy due to her advanced end-stage disease, poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score: 3), and advanced respiratory symptoms. She obtained a second opinion and was informed that her expected prognosis was less than one month. The patient sought other treatment options and was ultimately admitted to the ChemoThermia Oncology Center, Istanbul, Turkey on November 5, 2018. Upon admission, her weight was 38 kg (body mass index (BMI): 18.1 kg/m2). Poor performance status (ECOG score: 3) and a recent worsening respiratory tract infection were also noted.",36df9247-d93f-42ce-a624-d9b462020f15
12,introduction12," She underwent an objective clinical evaluation and documentation of her status, which included magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) of the brain with contrast, whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) CT, and a detailed laboratory assessment (Figures 1-3). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an 8-mm malignant lesion in the left occipital lobe. The fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan reconfirmed widespread metastatic disease with progression when compared to her prior scan. Laboratory results showed normal kidney function, a slight elevation in the liver enzyme level, and high C-reactive protein level of 119 mg/mL.

The patient received 17 treatment sessions in each session after 14-hour fasting. The patient’s blood glucose levels were measured by finger stick testing upon admission, and her blood glucose was titrated to the targeted pretreatment mildly hypoglycemic level with insulin administration. The attending physician and nurse closely monitored the patient’s blood glucose levels and assessed her for clinical symptoms of hypoglycemia. Her fasting blood glucose levels upon admission ranged between 67 and 88 mg/dL, whereas her achieved pretreatment blood glucose ranged between 51 and 58 mg/dL.",b79fd82f-a24b-4db3-bf1e-70c599b110f0
16,introduction16," A chemotherapy regimen comprised of gemcitabine (600 mg/m2), carboplatin area under the curve 2, and paclitaxel (60 mg/m2) was initiated upon reaching the targeted blood glucose level. This drug combination was delivered on the first and eighth day of a 21-day cycle. Concurrent with this treatment, 4 mg of zoledronic acid was delivered every 28 days to treat the metastatic bone lesions.  Ketogenic diet, hyperthermia, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy  The patient was advised to adopt a diet that was high in fat and significantly limited in carbohydrates, modeling a KD. She and her caregiver were informed in detail about which foods to include and which foods should be strictly avoided. She was directed to modify familiar meals by eliminating grains and reducing sugars and dense starches while simultaneously incorporating more fats. Given that her cancer was ER +, she was advised to limit high-fat dairy products, which are contraindicated in estrogen-sensitive cancers.",75a2a1ef-c1e1-4119-a2a4-5081b404b3e8
17,introduction17," At each visit, an assessment of the patient’s blood glucose levels and review of the caregiver’s food records offered evidence of the patient’s ongoing compliance with KD principles, and further refinements to the dietary plan were made at each visit. Together with every metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT) treatment, the patient also received local HT and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT): two sessions of each - one of each on the same day as metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT) and one of each on the day following metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT).  For each 60-minute HT session, an OncoTherm EHY-3010 HT device (OncoTherm, Troisdorf, Germany) was used to gradually increase the temperature of the tumoral region. The OncoTherm device uses modulated electrohyperthermia technology to selectively increase metabolic pressure on tumor tissue without negatively affecting the normal surrounding tissues, including the skin.",240bcd73-169d-4334-bf1e-83e6d2226668
18,introduction18," A 30 × 40-cm mobile electrode was used for HT sessions and was placed starting from the supraclavicular region and covering the thoracic region and the upper abdomen, including the liver, targeting both the primary tumor and the supraclavicular, thoracic, and liver metastatic lesions. The objective of HT was twofold: (1) to obtain a tumoral tissue temperature greater than 43°C at the tumor site, as this temperature is reported to be cytotoxic, and (2) to increase blood circulation to the tumoral region which, in turn, is expected to improve chemotherapy drug delivery. The device used indirect temperature estimations based on the energy applied: indirect heat estimation for this patient’s local HT sessions ranged from 44.1°C to 45.6°C.  For each 60-minute hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) session, a Quamvis320® hyperbaric oxygen chamber (OxyHealth, Santa Fe Springs, CA, USA) was used.

19,introduction19," The chamber was pressurized using a clean air compressor that filters air to 0.01 µm and a 10 L/min O2 concentrator to produce an operating pressure of 1.5 atmospheres absolute.  The patient’s treatment protocol comprising of metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT), KD, HT, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) was started together with infusional antibiotics on November 7, 2018. On November 9, she was hospitalized with respiratory complaints. On November 10, following the worsening of her respiratory function as evidenced by low blood oxygen saturation levels of 50% - 60%, she was intubated for effective medical support and transferred to the intensive care unit. Upon admission to the intensive care unit, her rectal swab culture was positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.

34,discussion4," Fasting lowers blood glucose levels and sensitizes cancer cells to treatment by increasing metabolic stress in cancer cells while also possibly protecting normal cells from chemotoxicity, thereby improving tolerance to treatment [19-20]​​​​​​​. In addition, insulin-induced mild hypoglycemia targets glucose dependency and dysregulated energy metabolism in cancer cells, thus further reducing the availability of glucose. This therapeutic strategy may cause acute metabolic stress in cancer cells, thus making them more vulnerable to the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents [3-4]​​​​​​​. Insulin may also facilitate the action of chemotherapeutic agents at the cellular level by increasing membrane fluidity and permeability. The subsequent formation of drug-insulin complexes internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis may facilitate an increase in drug penetration, thereby further enhancing the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents.",ba6a7d4f-472a-41f5-b553-f74ff692a7d8
35,discussion5," A number of insulin and insulin-like growth factor (insulin like growth factor (IGF)) receptors are upregulated on tumor cell membranes when compared to healthy cells of similar tissue origin. Breast cancer cells, for example, have approximately seven times more insulin receptors and 10 times more insulin like growth factor (IGF) receptors than normal breast tissue. The response of these receptors to insulin potentially extends the S phase of the cell cycle, thereby rendering cancer cells more susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents for longer periods of time. In addition, the lower concentration of insulin and insulin like growth factor (IGF) receptors on normal cells may effectively spare them from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents, possibly resulting in enhanced safety and tolerability.",40e87377-6078-42a5-8e2e-f583ce16f882
36,discussion6,"  Another component of our combinatorial treatment protocol was the KD, which also exploits the metabolic dysregulation of tumor cells, possibly exerting its action by lowering the circulating glucose level while increasing the ketone body level. Although the KD has been used for decades as a treatment for intractable pediatric epilepsy, its potential as a therapeutic modality that targets the energy metabolism of cancer cells has only recently been explored. To date, several preclinical studies and case reports have provided support for its potential adjunctive use in cancer treatment [8-12, 15]​​​​​​​. Notably, the patient described in this study did not receive radiotherapy for brain metastasis. The standard application of the chemotherapeutic drugs used in this protocol was not expected to produce a response due to the limited penetration of drugs across the blood-brain barrier.",49761f1d-a69d-4128-8ef1-ca6cd16377ab
37,discussion7," Instead, the resolution of her brain lesion might be attributed to ketogenic metabolic therapy, which has been reported to regress brain lesions in many preclinical glioma models and in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.  HT and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) also target dysregulated energy metabolism in cancer cells. HT exploits the heat sensitivity of cancer cells and is cytotoxic at temperatures > 43°C. Besides having a direct cytotoxic effect, HT contributes to therapeutic efficacy by facilitating chemotherapeutic drug uptake, inhibiting deoxyribonucleic acid (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)) repair in cancer cells, and increasing oxygen radical production [16]​​​​​​​. In this patient, tumor hypoxia, which is known to contribute to tumor aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, was targeted with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).",3ec19443-5593-4605-9287-6c045b8ff448
38,discussion8," Both HT and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) also target the reliance of tumor cells on glycolysis, which is associated with the upregulation of antioxidant activity responsible for the increased resistance of the tumor to prooxidant chemotherapy and radiation therapies [13]. As a consequence, HT and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) selectively increase oxidative stress in tumor cells, thus working synergistically with prooxidant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Ketone bodies protect normal cells from oxidative stress and provide a substrate for energy production in most normal cells. The concomitant synergistic use of these therapies (fasting, KD, HT, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)) and their potential to increase the efficacy of conventional therapies have already been reported in several previous studies on various malignancies [4, 8-12, 16, 18]​​​​​​​. In a recent study by Ohguri et al.",e9b75876-3ab3-4e88-8c3b-8c45b202894c
39,discussion9,", patients with non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with multiple pulmonary metastases received a carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy regimen, alongside HT and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT); reported results suggested that this combination offered a feasible and potentially efficacious protocol [16]​​​​​​​. In addition, promising outcomes, including remarkably improved survival rates, were reported in four recent case series evaluating the efficacy of the concurrent administration of these three modalities together with metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT) in patients with stage IV lung, stage IV pancreatic, stage III-IV gastric, and stage II-IV rectal cancers [9-12]​​​​​​​.  The patient in this case report had stage IV (T4N3M1) grade 3, ER +, PR +, HER2- breast cancer that had metastasized to the brain, lungs, mediastinum, liver, abdomen, and bones.",a9428ba4-b8fe-46bc-a772-232b3ca82e93
40,discussion10," The therapeutic strategy of combining metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT), KD, HT, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) administered over a six-month period yielded a complete response that has been sustained for two years with maintenance treatment consisting of KD, dietary supplements, and repurposed medications.  Conclusions  Clearly, there are many obstacles and failures in the current conventional clinical approach for treating highly metastatic end-stage disease. The findings of this study, along with the growing body of preclinical and clinical evidence, demonstrate that it is feasible to implement more effective and less toxic individualized cancer treatment protocols. To this end, more studies are needed to explore non-drug modalities and combination therapies that target multiple metabolic and cellular vulnerabilities in cancer cells.",1703de85-4117-405e-a96c-7e787487cf29
