0,methods0,"  We conducted a cross-sectional, online survey of pediatric neurologists across the world affiliated with the International Child Neurology Association, the Chinese Child Neurology Society, the Child Neurology Society, and the Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium. Results were analyzed in relation to regional burden of COVID-19 disease.   Study design  We conducted a cross-sectional, online survey of world pediatric neurologists. The sampling frame included members of the International Child Neurology Association (International Child Neurology Association (ICNA)), the Chinese Child Neurology Society, the Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium (Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium (PERC)), and the Child Neurology Society (Child Neurology Society (CNS)). We aimed to assess the experience from a variety of centers, countries, and regions, rather than to account for the practices of all individual members.",1ea43151-d2e3-4308-8cc2-04535c14d917
1,methods1," For example, we expected some countries would have few individual respondents because of the small numbers of pediatric neurologists in some parts of the world. Participants were recruited via an email to all International Child Neurology Association (ICNA) members and all Chinese Child Neurology Society members, a post on the Child Neurology Society (CNS) Connect “Open Forum” message board, and an email to all Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium (PERC) members.  Survey Design  The survey covered the following topics: (1) general information about practice; (2) shifts in outpatient clinical activities and access to electroencephalography (EEG); (3) approach to new-onset seizures and infantile spasms; (4) management of children with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies; (5) use of dietary therapies; and (6) use of epilepsy surgery.",917aa838-b278-4774-8cb0-f9383212c215
2,methods2," The questions on dietary therapies were only included in the survey sent to Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium (PERC) and Child Neurology Society (CNS) as most US institutions initiate the ketogenic diet with an admission to the hospital in contrast to some other regions of the world. Items included structured choices as well as free text responses.  Measures  Several items used semiquantitative measures, asking respondents to estimate numbers and percentages. In addition, one item used a Likert-type scale (1 to 10) to ask clinicians about the perceived degree of social distancing vigilance by families of their patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Free text questions gathered qualitative data to supplement several answer choices, and to provide anecdotes about clinical experience with COVID-19. These responses were reviewed for common themes, using a modified thematic analysis approach.",c6cb7241-7123-4e8f-a6fb-290c2816a6bb
3,methods3,"  COVID-19 Burden  We downloaded reports of COVID-19 cases and deaths from the New York Times 10 for US states and from Our World In Data11 for countries. We used mortality rate on April 15, 2020, as a rough measure of severity of the pandemic in each of these geographic areas, and subdivided burden into quartiles, based on number of reported deaths per 1 000 000 population, as follows: low (<2.6), medium (2.6-13.8), high (13.8-53.7), and very high (>53.7).  Missing Data  We report the degree of missing data but did not impute missing values.  Statistical Methods  Analyses were performed using SPSS, version 26.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY), and R, version 4.0.12 To compare categorical variables, we used the chi-square test. To compare continuous variables, we used independent t tests, the Wilcoxon test (paired or unpaired), and Spearman correlation, as appropriate. To assess for an association between practice (multinomial) and COVID-19 burden (ordinal), we used a modified Cochrane-Armitage Test.",70b309d7-5190-41da-b348-6883a41196a5

5,results0,"  From April 10 to 24, 2020, a sample of 212 respondents from 49 countries indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed many aspects of pediatric epilepsy care, with 91.5% reporting changes to outpatient care, 90.6% with reduced access to electroencephalography (EEG), 37.4% with altered management of infantile spasms, 92.3% with restrictions in ketogenic diet initiation, 93.4% with closed or severely limited epilepsy monitoring units, and 91.3% with canceled or limited epilepsy surgery. Telehealth use had increased, with 24.7% seeing patients exclusively via telehealth. Changes in practice were related both to COVID-19 burden and location.  Conclusions:  In response to COVID-19, pediatric epilepsy programs have implemented crisis standards of care that include increased telemedicine, decreased EEG use, changes in treatments of infantile spasms, and cessation of epilepsy surgery.

Infants and immunocompromised children are at risk for severe infections; however, children overall are less severely affected than adults.3,4 Many pediatric healthcare resources have contracted to accommodate critically ill adults, limit exposures to patients and staff, and conserve personal protective equipment.

For the 177 who provided additional details on their approach to a first unprovoked seizure, evaluation of a single afebrile seizure was associated both with COVID-19 burden (P < .0001) and geography (P < .05). In particular, the likelihood of an admission was much lower in North America (22%) than in other regions (Asia 67% and Other 73%; Figure 1). The approach to new-onset recurrent afebrile seizures did not significantly vary by COVID-19 burden (P = .4) nor by geography (P = .19).  a. Approach to infantile spasms  Of the 203 respondents who described their intended or actual practice to diagnose and treat infantile spasms, 76 (37.4%) indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in a practice change (Table 2).

Most (75.7%) indicated they would be comfortable diagnosing infantile spasms based on an interictal outpatient EEG with recorded sleep combined with a home video of a typical event. In the situation where EEG was not rapidly available, just more than half (54.",ecc26e6e-783a-4370-ad2f-981ca5fcde95
20,results15,"1%) agreed that a diagnosis could rest on a characteristic video of infantile spasms obtained by the family. However, many respondents indicated in their comments that diagnosis without EEG would require high-quality video, highly characteristic semiology, and known risk factors for infantile spasms. Some expressed a willingness to diagnosis by video alone because of worsening developmental outcomes with treatment delay. Other respondents indicated reluctance to diagnose by video, because other movements may mimic infantile spasms and misdiagnosis of children without infantile spasms could result in inappropriate exposure to the side effects of treatment.  Sixty-six respondents estimated their percentage of use of various treatments for infantile spasms before and during the pandemic, including 17 from North America, 36 from Asia, and 13 from other continents (Figure 3).",4a40d569-8dbc-4d8f-9b48-29bb0298e629

Sixty-three respondents indicated how they would manage an infant with newly diagnosed infantile spasms who had been exposed to the novel coronavirus. Most (69.8%) would choose a standard first-line infantile spasms treatment—usually vigabatrin (27/63) or oral steroids (14/63). Importantly, 17 (27.",a3940a7e-f40a-4494-9ae2-0aa5924870cb

One hundred seventeen respondents reported seeing at least 1 child with newly diagnosed infantile spasms since onset of the COVID-19 pandemic [median number of cases 2 (IQR 1, 5)].  Thirty-five respondents reported treating at least 1 child with hormonal therapy during the pandemic. Of these, 9 reported that adverse effects due to therapy had occurred (none related to infection), but only 1 child required a change to vigabatrin.  a. Children with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs)  Regardless of location, respondents noted that most families of children with DEEs were very cautious regarding social distancing, ranking their degree of caution at a mean of 7.94/10 (SD 2.0) on a Likert scale.",da46b426-2187-4238-9059-6d9b2d7c4640

Four of these respondents provided further details. In 2 children, seizures worsened. Both were managed at home. One child with DEE required ICU admission for respiratory distress, but not for worsening seizures.

The median number of individual children seen by each of these clinicians was 2 (IQR 1, 5), for a total of 160 children with COVID-19. Seventeen of these children (10.6%) were reported to have had acute symptomatic or febrile seizures. Encephalopathy was present in 7, and 7 had other neurologic symptoms (headache, weakness, and muscle pain). Seven children had anosmia, though respondents indicated in their free-text replies that this number may be an underestimate as this symptom is difficult to diagnose in young children.

28,discussion0," Summary of Key Findings  Our international survey, which included >200 respondents from 49 countries, found that clinical care for children with epilepsy has changed dramatically in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Areas with higher COVID-19 burden had more practice changes, such as greater restriction in outpatient face-to-face visits, decreased use of EEG in children with their first afebrile seizure, decreased admission rate for new-onset infantile spasms, and increased shift toward use of oral treatments for infantile spasms. However, restricted access to inpatient ketogenic diet initiation and inability to admit children for presurgical assessment or to perform epilepsy surgery were reported from nearly all centers, regardless of COVID-19 burden. Additionally, although acute symptomatic seizures were not reported in adults,15 our respondents suggest that acute symptomatic or febrile seizures do occur in children with COVID-19.",d7fd8fdd-7982-40b7-a594-77c748ee8ec0
29,discussion1,"  Infantile spasms  We were concerned to find an increase in use of nonstandard treatments for new-onset infantile spasms. Several rigorous studies have clearly demonstrated that these have lower efficacy than standard agents9,16 and that delaying effective therapy leads to a permanent decrease in developmental potential.17 High-dose oral steroids, with or without combination vigabatrin, have seen shown to be efficacious for infantile spasms18,19 and can be rapidly started if inpatient hospitalization is not possible. We therefore strongly encourage all clinicians who care for children with infantile spasms to use standard first-line treatment (adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prednisolone, or vigabatrin). Although there may be concerns regarding the use of high-dose oral steroid or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in children with potential COVID-19 exposure, vigabatrin should be considered in such cases as opposed to nonstandard therapies or delaying treatment.",db49c87b-dbfc-4387-a2b8-383d54c084db
30,discussion2," We were also concerned about the implications of reduced access to EEG, and the potential delays in diagnosis and treatment. Timely diagnosis and effective therapy are critical to maximize developmental outcomes.9,17 We encourage pediatric neurology programs to prioritize evaluation of suspected infantile spasms. Of interest, our survey was administered 1 week after the Child Neurology Society (CNS) issued a consensus recommendation for use of oral steroids, as opposed to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), as a crisis standard of care for new-onset infantile spasms—this may have influenced the response from child neurologists in North America. These recommendations are now published in summary20 and in full. The variations in care suggest there is an opportunity for international dissemination of guidelines21-23 and quality measures24 for infantile spasms care.",332ae5a5-09eb-49ad-8026-96823d9dc70a
31,discussion3,"  Epilepsy Surgery  It is strongly recommended that persons with focal epilepsy whose seizures remain uncontrolled after trials of 2 antiseizure medications be considered for surgical evaluation to determine whether they may be candidates for resection.25 In the developing brain, the negative impact of poorly controlled seizures on cognition is significant.26 For appropriately selected cases, early surgery improves long-term developmental outcomes, behavior, and quality of life.27,28 Additionally, uncontrolled convulsions increase the risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)).7 In young children with frequent ongoing seizures due to a surgically treatable structural brain abnormality, the risk-benefit of delayed surgery should be carefully considered.",f76a7013-fc38-4079-ac59-051858fdff77
32,discussion4," World-wide, delays in epilepsy surgery evaluations and resections raise the sobering possibility that a cohort of children will suffer irreparable neurodevelopmental harm or even death as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Ketogenic diet  The ketogenic diet can markedly reduce seizure burden, improve alertness, and improve development in children with drug-resistant epilepsy who are not candidates for epilepsy surgery.29-31 Less stringent forms of the ketogenic diet, such as the modified Atkins diet or low glycemic index diet, may have similar efficacy for older children; however, the classical ketogenic diet has better efficacy for children under age 2 years.32 For young children, inpatient dietary initiation is recommended to manage the risks of hypoglycemia and acidosis.",376bedb7-bc3a-4b2d-8c4d-48215c96e0b8
33,discussion5,"33,34 Our survey indicated that access to inpatient care for ketogenic diet initiation has been sharply restricted; as a result, children who require dietary therapies are at risk of either being prescribed a potentially less-effective option (modified Atkins diet or low glycemic index diet rather than classical ketogenic diet) or of suffering important adverse effects while treated at home. Return to prepandemic standards of care should be a priority as epilepsy programs resume clinical operations.  Telemedicine  The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in the use of telemedicine across many specialties. Although this has preserved access to care for families who have reliable Internet and telephone access, there are immediate concerns about disparities in access to care.",3b51c2a0-5939-4d67-8e81-229c3a6c6827
34,discussion6," Several key aspects of the neurologic examination cannot be performed remotely, such a Woods lamp examination to assess for hypopigmented macules, a funduscopic exam, accurate head circumference, or assessment of muscle tone. Furthermore, the impact of telehealth on difficult conversations, such as new diagnoses and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, is not known.  Access to EEG  Nearly all respondents reported reduced access to outpatient EEG, a core investigation in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy. Many respondents were relying on clinical history alone and/or review of home video to make diagnoses of first seizures or new-onset epilepsy, and in some cases, serious epileptic encephalopathies such as infantile spasms. The EEG regularly provides important information regarding epilepsy type and syndrome, which is crucial for planning further investigation and selecting optimal treatment. Furthermore, the EEG may capture subtle seizures that are missed by families.",ae4a9dfa-d5c6-4341-9f3a-d214a0cb4f77
35,discussion7," Decision making without EEG may lead to suboptimal treatment strategies and potentially an increase in adverse outcomes.  Limitations  Because of time constraints and a desire to obtain actionable information given the rapidly shifting nature of the pandemic, there was only a single request to complete the survey. We aimed for a broad sample that represented as many countries and as many US programs as possible at a particular time point rather than providing repeated reminders to increase response rates of individual clinicians. We analyzed the results in the context of publicly reported burden of mortality related to COVID-19 infections but acknowledge that there are regional differences in ability to report cases. Although our target population was the global community of child neurologists, the survey sample was limited to members of the target professional organizations.",669357aa-d76d-4eab-adc9-a08179b7312d
36,discussion8," We did not differentiate between responses from free-standing children’s hospitals versus pediatric care embedded in larger hospitals that also provide care to adults, though we acknowledge that hospital structure likely impacts access to care. Our study also has not looked at the economic status of respondent countries, which may impact their response to such a pandemic. Our survey items focused on changes in practice but did not fully assess the state of practice and access to resources prior to the pandemic. Finally, although the data reflect practice changes reported for a particular week in April 2020, they remain relevant given the likelihood of additional waves of infection.  Conclusion  Solutions to the range of challenging issues faced by epilepsy care teams and their patients will necessarily vary by geography, national and local resources, health insurance paradigms, and hospital structures.",c60f7106-e5f9-44b0-bae8-8b194ac6bba7
37,discussion9," Yet, our data are clear—the COVID-19 pandemic has caused profound changes to the care of children with epilepsy. Given the unknown timing of an effective vaccine and duration of increased burden of COVID-19 on the health care system, and the negative consequences of ongoing seizures, implementation of temporary, crisis standards of care for children with epilepsy are paramount. At the same time, key issues for the coming months and years include prioritization of a global backlog of children who require epilepsy surgery; optimizing access to EEG; and return to evidence-based treatment when crisis standards of care pose higher risk than exposure to the novel coronavirus. Importantly, re-emergence of face-to-face clinical care may be frightening both to families and to clinical care teams. A concerted effort to minimize risk and, as appropriate, maximize reassurance about infection control practices must be implemented. ",104bf3c4-746b-497f-b70b-18dbc9f811bc
