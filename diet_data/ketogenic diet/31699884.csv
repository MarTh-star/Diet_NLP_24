0,introduction0,"Insulin inhibition by a ketogenic diet has been shown to slow cancer growth and prolong survival in animal models and has shown safety and feasibility in small pilot studies in humans [1–4]. We previously demonstrated in a pilot study of ten people with diverse, metastatic PET positive cancers that higher levels of ketosis correlated with stability vs. disease progression throughout the course of the 28 day trial [5], Further, the metabolic rationale for ketogenic diets and insulin inhibition in cancer control is highly plausible [2,6]. The full potential of ketosis in cancer therapy, however, may reside in its potential to synergize with anti-cancer drugs and other modalities of treatment. Increased overall synergies may permit lower drug doses, thereby reducing their toxicities and side effects. Accordingly, it may be possible that the overall improvement in therapy will result in extended survival with a better quality of life.",768d25ac-8901-416c-98a4-56aa6a10bd50
1,introduction1,"  An understanding of ketogenic diets (KD) in cancer is limited at this point but it seems unlikely that KDs by themselves can control all the features of the oncogenic state. There is much interest, therefore, in the possibility of synergy with other drugs or other therapies. Hsieh, et al., for example, demonstrated that a squamous cell carcinoma that over expressed GLUT1 receptors showed attenuated growth when animals were on a KD [7]. There was, however, little regression of tumors. The addition of the cytotoxic agent cisplatin to mice on a KD led to regression to a greater extent than cisplatin alone. An interesting variation of this principle was recently demonstrated in mice bearing a Kras-Tp53-Pdx-Cre (Kras Tp53 Pdx Cre (KPC)) mutation by coupling a ketogenic diet with a PI3K inhibitor [8]. The specific benefit in this latter case was shown to arise from ketogenic diet attenuation of hyperglycemia induced by the PI3K inhibitor.",44830110-e714-486a-a885-c6d4124e3e9c
2,introduction2," Control of the hyperglycemia resulted in reduced glucose-driven cancer growth and proliferation. Hyperglycemia is also a well-known side effect of rapamycin in humans. Rapamycin, an antifungal compound known also as sirolimus, and congeners such as temsirolimus have been proposed and studied as anti-cancer drugs in triple negative breast cancers [9], but their usefulness may be limited by hyperglycemic side effects.  Rapamycin, in further analogy with PI3K inhibitors, has the potential to be an anti-cancer drug via its inhibition of mTOR, a signaling molecule downstream of PI3K which promotes cell growth and inhibits apoptosis. It has not achieved much clinical use due to hyperglycemic effects in humans [10]. Rapamycin causes diabetes in mice [11], although only at very high doses and extended duration of treatment.",5c59da16-4072-473d-bcd0-c0ce44617681
3,introduction3," Rapamycin was selected for the current animal study because it a) has the potential to be a successful anti-cancer drug when administered at doses known to be normo-glycemic in mice b) it may yet have utility in humans and c) has been an FDA approved drug since 1999 [12]. The principle of combining a ketogenic diet with other forms of anti-cancer chemotherapies for widely metastatic disease has been reported to have potential additive effects in mice [13,14], as well as in limited human studies [4,15–18]. As above, rapamycin is not expected to induce hyperglycemia in our mouse model and we wished to determine if a KD would exert its cytotoxic effects even in the absence of hyperglycemia.  Material and methods The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine reviewed and approved of this research protocol; protocol number 20170408.

4,introduction4," The ketogenic diet (KD) composition in calorie percent ratio of carbohydrate/fat/protein was 0.1/89.9/10.0. The standard diet’s (SD) distribution was 80/10/10. Both diets contain the same quality and quantity of mineral and vitamins and other necessary components. The fat content in both diets was from cocoa butter, with 59.7 gm, 32.9 gm and 3.0 gm of saturated (33.2 stearic and 25.4 palmitic), monounsaturated (32.6 oleic) and polyunsaturated fat (2.8% linoleic), respectively, per 100 gm of total fat, with trace amounts of other fats making up about 3% of the remainder. Omega 6 and omega -3 fatty acids contributed 2.8 gm and 0,1 gm, respectively. The KD and SD contain 6.71 and 3.85 calories/gm of energy, respectively. In general, a mouse needs 13.7 to 14.6 calories from their food [19].

At four months, 80–94% of these mice will have developed lung metastasis [20,21].  Mice were randomly divided into 6 groups of mice, 34 in total, 17 designated to overall SD groups, 17 to KD groups. All mice were were held at the Animal Institute for one week where they were all administered a SD. After an additional week, i.e. at approximately 2 weeks after arrival, or six weeks after birth, animals were returned to the investigator and were immediately assigned to the dietary groups, namely the SD, SD plus rapamycin at 0.4 mg/kg (SDr0.4), SD plus rapamycin at 4 mg/kg (SDr4), KD, KD plus rapamycin at 0.4 mg/kg (KDr0.4), and KD plus rapamycin at 4 mg/kg (KDr4).

At the third week of the special diets, rapamycin was given to mice by oral gavage with a 22-gauge feeding needle at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks. Mice were then maintained on both diets until euthanasia was required.  Housing and husbandry The Albert Einstein College of Medicine has an AAALAC accredited animal facility with clean barrier housing for mice. Animal caretakers check mice daily and food and water are provided ad libitum except as required in Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved animal protocols.

Our mice were housed and husbanded in the institution’s barrier animal facility. This was not secondary to intrinsic immunocompromise, as in nude mice. It was based, rather, on a requirement specific to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)) of our institution: that all cancer mice, particularly those receiving chemotherapy (which may compromise the immune system secondarily), must be housed in our institutional barrier to reduce the infection rate. As we employed a spontaneous cancer mouse model in which all mice developed breast cancer after 5 weeks of age and some received chemotherapy, the institutional Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) required barrier housing.",89fd65c7-2f78-4663-9c5f-ff35259a9983

Determination of moribund status and humane endpoints Animals were examined daily (by YZ) for their overall condition and signs of moribund behavior, and weekly to measure tumor volume. Mice were determined to have reached moribund status when they could no longer reach their food and/or when the sum of tumor volume within a mouse exceeded 4 cm3. Once mice reached this condition, they were euthanized within four hours which then constituted the duration of the experiment.

They were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, and blood (≥1 ml) was taken by cardiocentesis resulting in immediate death.  Tumor size and survival measurement Tumor size was measured weekly with calipers (by YZ). Volume was calculated from the longest (L) and shortest (S) dimensions according to Volume(mm3)=12L×S2. In this spontaneous breast cancer model, each mouse develops multiple tumors. The combined tumor volume represented by the sum of all visible tumor volumes was used as a surrogate measure of the overall tumor growth rate.

22,discussion0,"We have tested the effect of two diets, one very low in carbohydrate (≤ 0.1% of Calories); the other a standard diet (i.e. 80% calories from carbohydrate), on cancer growth and animal survival in a spontaneous breast cancer model in mice. Strict limitation of carbohydrate was effective at inhibiting serum insulin and glucose and inducing ketosis. While there were no ‘cures’, average overall tumor mass was reduced. The ketogenic group demonstrated prolonged survival as well. We also compared the effects of two different doses of rapamycin when added to the diets. Rapamycin delayed tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner and improved survival in both dietary groups. Greatest effects were seen when KD and rapamycin were combined.  In all groups, with or without rapamycin, the KD mice demonstrated longer survival, lower serum glucose and lower insulin concentrations than the corresponding SD mice.",516de9c1-45b3-4fef-b43b-5eabffa2d4e6
23,discussion1," The total lung tumor mass in the KD animals was significantly and substantially smaller than in the corresponding SD mice. In view of significantly longer survival of the KD animals, both of these results are consistent with slower tumor growth in KD vs. SD.  Strict insulin inhibition can result in two principle effects, both of which have the potential to induce cancer cell programmed cell death and to reduce proliferation of cancer cells. First, reduced blood insulin concentrations at the cancer cell membrane results in less binding to the insulin receptor with resulting downstream inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR (PI3K Akt mTOR (PAM)) signaling cascade [23], as well as the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway [24]. We therefore propose that reduced insulin concentration due to a ketogenic diet provides the potential to enhance programmed cell death by inhibiting the PI3K Akt mTOR (PAM) cascade, and to reduce proliferation via both pathways [25,26].",ebf55630-63e8-488e-a9ff-81c5fdc45dc5
24,discussion2," A general caveat, of course, is that well-known, common mutations causing constitutive activation of PI3K Akt mTOR (PAM) protein signals (e.g. PI3KCa) will resist programmed cell death and allow proliferation to continue [27]. Nonetheless those malignancies without these mutations can be therapeutically susceptible to the insulin inhibiting effects.  Second, hepatic ketogenesis due to insulin inhibition increases blood levels of the ketone bodies beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, both of which have demonstrated histone deacetylase inhibitor effects at the cellular level. HDAC inhibitors are known to be capable of reducing cancer cell proliferation as well as enhancing programmed cell death [28–30].  Reduced proliferation was indeed observed as seen in the reduced extent of lung metastatic mass to total body mass ratios with KD in all groups.",49ac81a2-eebf-4786-b5e6-dc37bc9379c7
25,discussion3," However, while necrosis in the KD groups was also detected in tumor specimens, meaningful differences with SD could not be identified definitively with our small sample size.  The potential of ketogenic diets to inhibit cancers has been suggested, mainly in animal models, for at least four decades [31,32]. Human data has been limited mostly to a few case reports or small clinical trials [5,33–36]. Additional studies have been reported more recently [37]. Meanwhile, in the past decade, interest has grown in insulin inhibition as a potential cancer therapeutic adjunct. Metformin, for example, has been applied toward this end with promising results in the neoadjuvant setting for breast cancer [38], but when applied therapeutically has demonstrated limited benefit [39]. Dietary carbohydrate restriction and metformin both reduce insulin secretion and glucose concentration, but the overall effect of carbohydrate restriction has additional effects beyond those of metformin.",c3889bb2-9ffc-420a-afc6-be71577c3ed0
26,discussion4," This is observed in its ability to induce formation of ketone bodies, known HDAC inhibitors. Ketone body formation speaks to the potential for translation to humans, as the 2 mM maximum extent of ketosis achieved in our mouse model is exceeded in people for whom 4–5 mM are quite achievable.  Nonetheless, one cannot assume that our mouse model results will translate to humans. Many mouse models, including our spontaneous breast tumor mouse with a B6 phenotype background, have been shown to have a degree of insulin resistance [40]. This resistance is reflected by a) persistent, high glucose concentrations in the SD group as well as b) delayed return of glucose concentrations to normal in the KD group (see persistent high glucose at 11 days in Fig 1, suggesting ongoing insulin resistance effect). Therefore, some of the relative survival disadvantage of the SD group may have resulted from a heightened insulin growth effect on the tumors.",15a91c0e-20c7-4656-898a-c21369bcd90e
27,discussion5," But it is worth noting, too, that the KD group might also have lived longer without prolonged high glucose levels. In any event, obesity with insulin resistance is commonplace among many patients with breast cancer, particularly in post-menopausal women [41]. The ultimate response to a KD in humans with breast cancer therefore demands controlled trials for those with normal as well as abnormal insulin sensitivity.  The results support the potential value of ketogenic diets in cancer therapy when coupled with existing agents, permitting additive or synergistic effects with toxic drugs. Successful translation, then, could result in reduction of drug doses while improving overall therapeutic effectiveness, thus extending patient survival while improving the quality of life during that period of greater longevity.",c5aae281-da13-48f9-8244-2450839d9f4f

41,discussion19," You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)  Reviewer #1: The paper ""The effect of a ketogenic diet and synergy with rapamycin in a mouse model of breast  cancer"" is an important contribution to the growing literature on ketogenic therapy in cancer.  The research question is well described and relevant given the fact that rapamycin has received a lot of attention as a  calorie restriction mimetic and anti-ageing drug.  The study has several strengths, among them the naturally occurence of the murine breast tumors instead of xenografted ones,  measurement of relevant outcome variables and good description of the methods and results.  The major limitation is the small sample size in some of the treatment groups (n=4), but the  treatments were chosen as to still provide sufficiantly clear outcome differences.",46109fea-3552-4db2-9d0d-cd91b6822286
42,discussion20,"  The most obvious limitation when reading the paper was that many references did not support the claims made.  I therefore recommend publication of this paper after some points are corrected by the authors. I think this will  further improve the scientific rigor and clarity of argumentation.  - Lines 37-39: The authors refer to insulin inhibition, suggesting therefby from the outset  that this is a major mechanism how ketogenic diets work. However, none of the four references cited  have measured insulin levels or discussed this mechanism in great detail. Ref. 1 has no authors listed , I suppose  it is a review by Allen et al. 2014, Redox Biol 2:963-970 ? Ref.4 did not show any benefit of the ketogenic diet  and therefore does not support the claim of the authors made in that sentence. Please cite more relevant studies showing  tumor growth inhibition potentially achieved via insulin decrease (e.g. Venkateswaran et al. 2007, JNCI 99:1793-1800)  or drop the statement about insulin here.",3d47c1c8-7c4e-4891-9cbf-dfe45683f185
43,discussion21,"  - Line 73: The authors refer to additive effects of a ketogenic diet with chemotherapy in mice, but cite Iyikesici et al (ref.12) which is  a human study, Gluschnaider et al. (ref.13) which did not combine a ketogenic diet with chemotherapy, and Schartz et al. (ref. 14) which is  a review not specifically on the ketogenic diet. Thus, none of these references support the claims made. Instead, I would recommend citing  the following studies:  Klement (2018), Complementary Medicine Research 25(2):102-113; Morscher et al. (2016), Oncotarget 7:17060–17073;  Kim et a. (2012), BJU International 110:1062-1069  PLease also delete ""for widely metastatic disease"" (line 72), this is not true for all studies  - Same line (73): Ref.4 and ref. 15 have shown no benefit of the ketogenic diet, hence do not support the claim made  - Line 103: Please define Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at first usage.  - Line 123: Instead of ""etc.",5e198220-e72a-49a2-bbde-36dd4f53289d

45,discussion23," 2020, Med Oncol 37:14 who  have summarized clincal studies with relevant outcomes  - Figure 1: axis label ""Days elapsed"" refers to which time point?  - Data availability statement was missing  Reviewer #2: The manuscript entitled “The Effect of a Ketogenic Diet and Synergy with Rapamycin in a Mouse Model of Breast Cancer.” PONE-D-20-11420 The authors attempt to demonstrate that ketogenic diet combined with rapamycin inhibits breast cancer growth. There are both major and minor problems with this paper that make a thorough review difficult.  Some minor problems that need to be addressed: Line 73 of introduction states, “effects in humans” and then lists references that are feasibility studies, and do not show effectiveness. Researchers must be very careful with language when discussing human trials. Line 82 list the protein/carb/fat content but does not discuss the kind of fat used. We have found that the lipid/PUFA content of the KD is very important for tumor growth inhibition.",0ac1c048-aec2-4ac1-9fc2-647298fcc79a
46,discussion24," Please list the complete content of the diet. Line 183 a decimal is missing. Figure 1B, the initial blood glucose is very high in all the animals. Even after 11 days the glucose level is very high in KD groups. This is very surprising and counterintuitive. Sometimes blood glucose in mice spikes if they are scared and the time of the blood draw and you don’t act very quickly. Therefore, hemoglobin A1C might be a better indicator of true glucose control. Figure 1D insulin spelling on the axis and no indication of statistics performed. Figure 2A how many mice were in each group. It should be in the legend. The way that you measure tumor growth hides important data. Did you count the number of tumors arising on each mouse (tells us if initiation is affected); vs tumor volume of a single tumor (growth inhibition).  Some major problems to be addressed: line 108 indicates that there was only one investigator measure the mice.",fc4cbcb2-90ec-4651-9456-f1970d2e4fc9
47,discussion25," How could you keep that person blinded? Tumor size measurements has been shown to be subject to UNintentional biasing. It is essential that the investigator be blinded. Also, the general health of the mice needs to be investigated. Were they lethargic? Was there a change in their coat? Is there any other indication that the mice we made ill by the treatment? Lastly, the lung needs to be examined by a blinded pathologist to determine the number and stage of the nodules.  In general, there might be interesting information within the text but because the data is not adequately described it is impossible for me to adequately review it.  **********  6.

67,discussion45,"” PONE-D-20-11420 The authors attempt to demonstrate that ketogenic diet combined with rapamycin inhibits breast cancer growth. There are both major and minor problems with this paper that make a thorough review difficult.  Some minor problems that need to be addressed: Line 73 of introduction states, “effects in humans” and then lists references that are feasibility studies, and do not show effectiveness. Researchers must be very careful with language when discussing human trials.  As described in answer to Reviewer #1 we have changed the references.  Line 82 lists the protein/carb/fat content but does not discuss the kind of fat used. We have found that the lipid/PUFA content of the KD is very important for tumor growth inhibition. Please list the complete content of the diet.  The diet composition is now listed.",8dc392ad-bb71-4d97-bb20-d20440a4b689
68,discussion46," Both diets contained fat derived from cocoa butter, obviously with the same ratio of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats; of course, the total amount of fat was very different. It is certainly plausible that other ratios of PUFA to saturated fats would have effects beyond those we’ve shown. It would be interesting and important to understand those effects, but that is a different study than we sought to accomplish.   Line 183 a decimal is missing.   Fixed.  Figure 1B, the initial blood glucose is very high in all the animals. Even after 11 days the glucose level is very high in KD groups. This is very surprising and counterintuitive. Sometimes blood glucose in mice spikes if they are scared and the time of the blood draw and you don’t act very quickly. Therefore, hemoglobin A1C might be a better indicator of true glucose control.  This is a good point and interesting observation.",da12767a-2124-4fdf-9cd3-cd40ac9fafe1
69,discussion47," This is not a common breed of mouse and the high glucose may be related to the physiology but, at this point, it is a reproducible measurement. It has also been our observation in other mouse and rat experiments that high and irregular glucose concentrations can be observed. Despite the high glucose value, it was interesting, and we believe important, that insulin remained low in the ketogenic diet group, and not in the standard diet group. It appears that in at least some rodent breeds glucose levels are not regulated nearly as tightly as in humans. We did not measure glucagon, and perhaps that would have some bearing.

It would surely be interesting to understand initiation better, but this was not the point of the study.  Some major problems to be addressed: line 108 indicates that there was only one investigator measure the mice. How could you keep that person blinded? Tumor size measurements has been shown to be subject to UNintentional biasing. It is essential that the investigator be blinded.  Tumor size was measured with calipers. We do not believe bias was involved but we must acknowledge that it’s possible to harbor an inadvertent bias, ie to ‘wish’ for a particular result. So we thank the reviewer for pointing out this possibility.",af8f3bc0-4cfd-4c65-b876-b5872c6651ef
71,discussion49,"  However, even if bias of any kind was involved at the time of caliper measurements, lung weight (vastly tumor) and body were weighed at post-mortem. There is no personal judgement involved in weight measurements. If bias was involved at the point of animal euthanasia (i.e. if tumors were measured as too large in order to inadvertently delay the euthanasia) then the weight measurement of metastases to the lungs should not have turned out lower than in the standard diet group.  The above said, we appreciate the insight. Whereas we did not even consider the idea of blinding the caliper measurements in the present study, we will certainly do so in future studies. I have double checked with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) who have informed me that this is indeed the standard.   Also, the general health of the mice needs to be investigated.",7a786c0f-20c2-470a-add5-84f6256c7439
72,discussion50," Were they lethargic? Was there a change in their coat? Is there any other indication that the mice we made ill by the treatment? Lastly, the lung needs to be examined by a blinded pathologist to determine the number and stage of the nodules.  The general health of the mice was indeed evaluated daily, as in the text. In particular, the ability of the mice to reach their food or water (or lethargy, i.e. the inability to reach the food or water) was assessed regularly, as indicated. The coat was evaluated weekly, but no changes were observed. Since inability to reach food was the justification for euthanasia, as determined by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), we did not indicate animal coat quality in the text; a clear coat did not change our decision. The animals were dragging due to a huge burden of primary and especially metastatic disease, as their lung to total body weight ratios in our table indicate.",420a9f9c-358c-4b13-bb8d-d30624d86dad
73,discussion51," The coat quality, which may otherwise be important, in this instance had no role in determining the endpoint of this study.  The lungs were indeed evaluated by a blinded pathologist (co-author Dr. Fineberg), as indicated in the text. But the most fundamental data, from the perspective of tumor metastatic mass, was the measurement of lung weight. A pathologic figure was provided, but only as representative of the lung data, as explicitly stated in the legend. Actual counting of mets and sizes of mets by the pathologist were statistically far less meaningful than overall metastatic lung mass and weight. The overall tumor mass provides the integral of tumor mass from what would have to be innumerable slides. The measure of total metastatic mass to determine overall metastatic information was approved by our pathology co-author who read and reviewed the manuscript, as indicated in our submission.",84e9b28c-3a6d-429f-a660-a54e91877ced
74,discussion52,"  In general, there might be interesting information within the text but because the data is not adequately described it is impossible for me to adequately review it.  We respectfully disagree. We’ve added the additional information requested, but the data are qualitatively as well as quantitatively different between groups and highly consistent across experimental measurements. The experimental design determines how long the mice survived and the difference in metabolic parameters is clear. This is the point of the experiment. Representative tissue from pathologic sections are shown in Figure 4, but, as in the comment above, these kinds of data were not considered adequate for statistical evaluation of a process in a mouse model of breast cancer which by design metastasizes specifically to the lungs.  10.1371/journal.pone.0233662.",c29c2fd4-04fb-4373-b174-996401a32cc4

83,discussion61,"r004 Author response to Decision Letter 1 Submission Version2 1 Oct 2020   The manuscript entitled “The Effect of a Ketogenic Diet and Synergy with Rapamycin in a Mouse Model of Breast Cancer.” PONE-D-20-11420 The authors attempt to demonstrate that ketogenic diet combined with rapamycin inhibits breast cancer growth. There are both major and minor problems with this paper that make a thorough review difficult.   Some minor problems that need to be addressed: Line 73 of introduction states, “effects in humans” and then lists references that are feasibility studies, and do not show effectiveness. Researchers must be very careful with language when discussing human trials.  As described in answer to Reviewer #1 we have changed the references.   I do not think you have adequately addressed my concerns. The first sentence and line 74 still imply effectiveness of KD in humans. None of the references 1-4 or 15-17 support effectiveness in human studies.",7d0b874c-deea-4267-91a0-808b9ec3eb8f
84,discussion62," There are numerous small studies that show feasibility of KD only. Reference 6 (probably changed for reference 5?) is a small pilot study that concludes nothing about prolonged survival. In addition, all references need to be double checked for accuracy.   Reference 5 and reference 6 do indeed need to be swapped. We have done this.  We owe Dr. Klement an apology for improperly describing data that he illustrated very well in his review (ref. 37), now properly included. This review as well as some of the other articles now cited were not available on-line in our institution’s library at the time we wrote our response (the library as well as the institution were having IT difficulties, partly due to COVID19 and staffing) but these references have since become available. We were in the unfortunate position of quoting articles that Dr. Klement recommended without the opportunity to read them properly.   In this comment I agree with the reviewer in many respects.",cd3b807c-1fa3-486c-b2cc-e7d8749017b4
85,discussion63," We didn’t actually use the term effectiveness. The terms “effects” and “efficacy” are employed in several sentences, but not in reference to the articles Dr. Klement describes. The first sentence and line 74 both use the word “effects”, but in the context of animal studies, not humans. There is also a distinction between efficacy from effectiveness when used in a medical context. Effectiveness is an overall measure used when patients take drugs clinically, including an overall reduction of benefit when patients stop taking drugs due to side effects, for example. The term efficacy is limited to controlled trials, where behavior of the subjects is controlled, by definition, and where efficacy is measured among those who successfully take the medication.   In any event our study’s goal was to reduce side effects so that an increase in the overall effectiveness of combined therapies might be realized, perhaps eventually in humans.",5adb951b-5824-4c02-832c-54b03bb234ee
86,discussion64," So, perhaps ironically, we should actually have used the term effectiveness, not efficacy, with reference to our hoped for future objective in patients. We have swapped in that term in the relevant sentences of the Introduction as well as in the Discussion.  Given these distinctions, while we agree with the reviewer that phase 1 trials are designed to measure feasibility and safety and, are not designed to measure efficacy or effectiveness, it is not at all unusual for such measures to be reported anyway. For illustrative purposes, in refs 15-17, itemized by Dr. Klement, the trials were designed to measure safety and feasibility, but various outcome effects (overall survival, for example) were indeed measured and reported.   I hope the above clarifies what we meant to say.   Line 82 list the protein/carb/fat content but does not discuss the kind of fat used. We have found that the lipid/PUFA content of the KD is very important for tumor growth inhibition.",f67b4bfa-af87-4413-872e-8049eca99b38
87,discussion65," Please list the complete content of the diet.   The diet composition is now listed.

It would be interesting and important to understand those effects, but that is a different study than we sought to accomplish.  Thank you for the though listing of fat/PUFA content. This is important data for other researchers wishing to build upon when answering the specific types of nutrients to include in a diet.   Line 183 a decimal is missing.   I did find a missing decimal on line 219 in the revised version and corrected this. Thank you. (I have line 183 in front of me and see no missing decimals.

88,discussion66," This could be an issue of changing line numbers during editing.)   Figure 1B, the initial blood glucose is very high in all the animals.

89,discussion67," It appears that in at least some rodent breeds glucose levels are not regulated nearly as tightly as in humans. We did not measure glucagon, and perhaps that would have some bearing.  Glucose and insulin level data if very important especially because this study might be translated into humans. It is important to discuss the limitations of model system. The original strain of mice in which this model system was derived, B6 have very high fasting and non-fasting glucose. They also have abnormal insulin responses. These mice might resemble diabetic or glucose intolerant humans more so than healthy humans. A good reference for this discussion is: Glucose Homeostasis and Tissue Transcript Content of Insulin Signaling Intermediates in Four Inbred Strains of Mice: C57BL/6, C57BLKS/6, DBA/2, and 129X1 Endocrinology, Volume 145, Issue 7, 1 July 2004. In Figure 1 the KD returns the glucose level down to what would be in wildtype strains or healthy humans not on a KD.",6867499c-6074-4d04-8023-fdbdf0b36bf6
90,discussion68," For clarity please list the strain of mouse used in the abstract; add comparisons of glucose and insulin levels of wild type mice in the results; and the limitations to translation of the model system to humans in the discussion. Another important point for the discussion is that the diet in this study is very low in carbohydrates and does not resemble most human KDs.   We thank the reviewer for pointing out our omission. We have surely added that effects seen in mouse models cannot be assumed to apply to humans. However, if anything, a higher glucose level in a mouse vs. a human (on a KD) would argue for a better effect in the human than the mouse. Humans also can reach higher levels of ketosis than mice, even though they consume less restrictive ketogenic diets, so the effects in mice again may argue for an even better response in humans. Nonetheless, we agree that we cannot assume translation to the human without further study and we have indicated this.",82a59999-9182-4638-89c4-a0b1662321cf
91,discussion69,"  We have observed wide variations in blood glucose responses in mice in previous studies of our own. We have chosen to not discuss these aspects of mouse physiologic behavior in detail. This is a complex subject and has no direct bearing on the primary results showing prolonged survival. We’ve pointed out that rapamycin itself causes hyperglycemia in humans, although not in mice in doses such as those administered. The observation that hyperglycemia without hyperinsulinemia was seen initially on the ketogenic diet in this mouse model and then reverted to normal glucose concentrations during the ketogenic diet is surely an unusual finding. The overall pattern however shows distinct differences between a continued KD vs. a continued SD, where in the latter neither the high glucose levels (nor the insulin levels) correct over time.",12a70dc2-7eb2-4136-93e8-87c7ed279a71
92,discussion70," The suggestion that an initial anxiety reaction (provoking epinephrine secretion with attendant hyperglycemia, for example) is quite plausible, but we did not obtain epinephrine levels.   Further discussion on the potential hormonal interactions would indeed be interesting but would nonetheless be largely speculative without additional data. At this point the speculation involved would be fodder for further criticism but would contribute little to our primary observations or the reasons for our study. This kind of discussion would be more appropriate to a comprehensive review article of hyperglycemia in mice and the variations seen in different mouse breeds.  In summary, the desired and expected physiologic effect of ketosis measured in our mouse model was, despite the extreme level of carbohydrate restriction, if anything, less pronounced than an expected effect in humans.",b048bec1-5d42-4ea4-9f15-8cc17ab16758
93,discussion71," We elicited 2 mM ketone body concentrations in mouse serum, whereas a lesser extent of CHO restriction normally achievable by humans can produce 4-5 mM or more. These differences between mouse and human models have no obvious bearing on our hypothesis or on our primary observations. Similar to the complex issue of glycemic responses in diverse mouse species above, this discussion would be more appropriate to a review article.   Figure 1D insulin spelling on the axis and no indication of statistics performed. Figure 2A how many mice were in each group.    It should be in the legend.   The number of mice in each group is not in the figure legend. The abstract should read 3-9 mice per group on line 20. Line 194 still incorrectly says 6 groups of 34 mice each. It is upsetting to this reviewer that the problem was not adequately addressed the first time. It looks like only 7 mice are in the survival graph in the SD.",d48ea413-7a95-4ebb-bb32-34cab0d0baec
94,discussion72,"   We apologize for not recognizing these errors, presumably resulting from the mental blur of reviewing the same text too many times. We’ve corrected the numbers in the paper as well as added the recommended numbers to the abstract. The numbers of mice in the SD at start are 9, as indicated.

Metastases do not reflect initiation as they arise due to additional mutations which permit breaking off from the primary tumor, lodging and growing in distant tissues, etc. The lung metastases were innumerable and these numbers were not reported by the pathologist. Larger nodule sizes were reported in the supplemental data, but these data were limited and differences between groups were not statistically significant, as indicated in the text. As you can see from the representative slide, many were microscopic. The bulk of the paraffin block was not used for staining. It was saved for RNA sequencing analysis and proteomics, both sent to other laboratories. These analyses were delayed by COVID and could not be included in this paper. At this point we don’t know if these samples will ever be analyzed or even recovered.",0458fe07-bc20-4445-af1a-89a916430f13
96,discussion74,"  Some major problems to be addressed: line 108 indicates that there was only one investigator measure the mice. How could you keep that person blinded? Tumor size measurements has been shown to be subject to UNintentional biasing. It is essential that the investigator be blinded. Also, the general health of the mice needs to be investigated.   Tumor size was measured with calipers. We do not believe bias was involved but we must acknowledge that it’s possible to harbor an inadvertent bias, ie to ‘wish’ for a particular result. So we thank the reviewer for pointing out this possibility. However, even if bias of any kind was involved at the time of caliper measurements, lung weight (vastly tumor) and body were weighed at post-mortem. There is no personal judgement involved in weight measurements. If bias was involved at the point of animal euthanasia (i.e.",2707d446-a117-497a-94ab-1e4a7a6dadc9
97,discussion75," if tumors were measured as too large in order to inadvertently delay the euthanasia) then the weight measurement of metastases to the lungs should not have turned out lower than in the standard diet group. The above said, we appreciate the insight. Whereas we did not even consider the idea of blinding the caliper measurements in the present study, we will certainly do so in future studies. I have double checked with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) who have informed me that this is indeed the standard.  Thank you for your considered response. I agree that the large difference in the tumor volume was unlikely due to unintentional bias. I also think that lung weight is valid measurement to report. The line about an individual measurer should be left in the manuscript so the limitations of the study are clearly understood.   Thank you for your remark as well. We have indicated the individual measurer.",da9f17dc-dfc7-4e58-b6f7-60843de3924f
98,discussion76,"  Were they lethargic? Was there a change in their coat? Is there any other indication that the mice we made ill by the treatment?  The general health of the mice was indeed evaluated daily, as in the text. In particular, the ability of the mice to reach their food or water (or lethargy, i.e. the inability to reach the food or water) was assessed regularly, as indicated. The coat was evaluated weekly, but no changes were observed. Since inability to reach food was the justification for euthanasia, as determined by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), we did not indicate animal coat quality in the text; a clear coat did not change our decision. The animals were dragging due to a huge burden of primary and especially metastatic disease, as their lung to total body weight ratios in our table indicate. The coat quality, which may otherwise be important, in this instance had no role in determining the endpoint of this study.",dcd8f9ee-1275-4a9b-8522-b344bc462ebe
99,discussion77,"  I understand that the condition of the mice regarding tumor burden was evaluated but what about diet and rapamycin. Did you see a change in the mice before the tumor endpoint that might indicate that they did not tolerate the diet or drug?  We’ve indicated all the changes that were observed. None of the already described changes could be attributed to rapamycin, and none suggested intolerance to either diet or to the drug. As mentioned, there were changes neither in the coat quality nor were there behavioral changes other than those already mentioned. We saw no intolerance to rapamycin or diet and saw no reason to raise these issues, particularly while mice have long been studied with ketogenic diets as well as with rapamycin at moderate doses without such intolerance reported. (Ketogenic diets administered by Tisdale et al, as in our reference go back to the 1980’s. Rapamycin has been used in mice studies for years, and just recently reported in Nature, (our ref.",1eb4e3cf-6855-4a91-b0f5-e72542862223
100,discussion78," 8) without such effects noted.)  Lastly, the lung needs to be examined by a blinded pathologist to determine the number and stage of the nodules.   The lungs were indeed evaluated by a blinded pathologist (co-author Dr. Fineberg), as indicated in the text. But the most fundamental data, from the perspective of tumor metastatic mass, was the measurement of lung weight. A pathologic figure was provided, but only as representative of the lung data, as explicitly stated in the legend. Actual counting of mets and sizes of mets by the pathologist were statistically far less meaningful than overall metastatic lung mass and weight. The overall tumor mass provides the integral of tumor mass from what would have to be innumerable slides. The measure of total metastatic mass to determine overall metastatic information was approved by our pathology co-author who read and reviewed the manuscript, as indicated in our submission.   Line 172 should say blinded pathologist.",773c76db-ace0-4bef-9078-24ea381ac566
101,discussion79," For figure 4, the number of mets in the lung is interesting and important and should be included especially considering the experimental limitations on the other data. If the data is good enough to be included as a qualitative figure than it should be quantified.   The number of overall mets was innumerable but was quantified per high power field by the pathologist based on the slide she evaluated. It is not reasonable to extrapolate macroscopic numbers from one or several microscopic slides. We have discussed this with our pathologist. The reason we reported the weight of the lung metastases was precisely because an attempt at enumeration of metastases from slides had serious statistical limitations. We indicated this in the text. We have included the pathologic enumeration of metastases from slides as provided to us by our blinded pathologist in the Supplemental Data.",c0a30f9f-869f-4758-9168-f089483e98c7
102,discussion80,"  There are still multiple minor issues including but not comprehensively; line 194 says 4 week old mice started the diet while line 237 says 6 week old. It is never explained if the mice go off both the treatment and the diet after 5 weeks or do they continue on the diet until death? Too many period on line 201. Line 88 has grams 3 different ways. More than one font is used.   Thank you for noticing these inconsistencies. The mice were received at approximately 4 weeks of age from Jackson Labs and were started on their diets at approximately 6 weeks, on which they remained until death by euthanasia. This information has been clarified in the text. Multiple “gram” spellings have been condensed to ‘gm’ in all cases. I can’t find extra periods on line 201 or anywhere nearby.
