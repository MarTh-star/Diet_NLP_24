0,introduction0,"The ketogenic diet (KD) was first introduced as an antiepileptic treatment, in 1921 (Wilder 1921), but it was not until 1976 that KD was shown to be beneficial in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)) deficiency (Falk et al. 1976). The biochemical rationale behind the metabolic effect of KD lies in the fact that this is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that mimics the metabolic state of long-term fasting. In pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency, the glycolytic end product, pyruvate, is not optimally metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, leading to increased production of lactate and impaired production of adenosine triphosphatase (adenosine triphosphatase (ATP)) via the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Reed 1974; Robinson et al. 1987). During carbohydrate deprivation, cellular energy is no longer derived from glycolysis but from degradation of fatty acids.",a73e1bee-1344-408f-8c36-37b9ed659d84
1,introduction1," The ketone bodies (3-beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone) generated by fatty acid oxidation serve as an alternative energy substrate to glucose for the brain (Pierre and Pellerin 2005; Scholl-Bürgi et al. 2015).  In this study, we present the results of a Swedish cohort of 19 pediatric patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency treated with KD. The aim was to depict the short- and long-term effects of KD on disease course and disease-related outcomes and elucidate metabolic factors associated with these outcomes. Potential safety and compliance issues related to this dietary treatment were also evaluated. ",a45e3717-9f94-42be-8691-ef64a550bf1f
2,methods0,Setting This was a longitudinal cohort study of pediatric patients diagnosed with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency in Sweden and treated with KD between January 2009 and March 2016. All patients diagnosed and followed according to a specific protocol (supplementary Table e1) at the two referral centers for inherited metabolic diseases in Sweden—the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg and the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm—were included.  Inclusion criteria Inclusion criteria were:  (1) Disease onset before 18 years of age  (2) Clinical and laboratory phenotype compatible with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency  (3) Presence of pathogenic mutation(s) associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency  (4) Treatment with KD for a minimum of 3 months  (5) Data availability on medical records to achieve >90% of data point coverage on the Case Report Form (Case Report Form (CRF)).,c8a6ea64-8084-4f34-ba55-10967fbaa184
3,methods1,"  Data analysis Patients were prospectively evaluated at baseline then 3, 6, and 12 months, and then every sixth month according to the ketogenic diet protocol (Table e1). Each patient was clinically assessed by the same physician across evaluations. Neurocognitive development was assessed at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and every second year with the help of the Griffiths Mental Development Scales and the Wechsler Scales for Children (WPPSI-III and WISC-IV), where appropriate, depending on patient’s chronological age and cognitive development at baseline. The main neurocognitive outcomes were speech and language development, performance, social functioning, and composite score of the neurocognitive subtests, indicating patient intelligence. The latter is presented as a full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) or general developmental quotient (GQ).  Gross- and fine-motor development was assessed by the pediatric neurologist and physiotherapist who followed the patient.",fa824656-7d8a-4d60-b3fd-668b01e65515
4,methods2," Dietary compliance was assessed from: (a) ketosis level based on the levels of 3-hydroxybutyric acid (ketone bodies) measured at home with a hand-held meter and at the laboratory at follow-up visits; (b) nutrient intake, estimated with the help of 4-day food records collected at each follow-up visit. Safety outcomes were assessed with the help of regular monitoring of side effects and biochemical investigations performed in fasting state (Table e1).  The overall treatment outcome was assessed at the last follow-up visit and compared with baseline using the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scale, ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). At the last follow-up visit, parents were asked to complete a questionnaire sharing their perspectives of global improvement from baseline to last follow-up visit.",9d7b9443-b494-4ea8-8f98-50521e1df20a
5,methods3," Parents were also asked to evaluate their child’s improvement during treatment from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) in the following areas: motor skills, cognitive skills, social/behavioral skills, and epileptic seizures. Neuroradiologic examination before and after KD initiation was not part of the protocol.  All data were retrospectively collected from patient records with the help of a Case Report Form (CRF). Since pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency is a rare neurometabolic disorder, the statistical methods applied were mainly descriptive. The two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare lactate values before versus after KD start. The two-tailed paired t test was used to compare morning versus evening lactate levels. A p value <0.05 was considered significant.  Systematic literature review Study methodology is presented in Table e2.",12a3899b-ea1b-4546-b2d6-3987978f6174

This patient had periods with poor dietary compliance accompanied by worsening dysarthria and stagnation of speech development. Three patients (13, 14, 17) developed language skills to a minimum language developmental age of 2.5 years at last follow-up. Slow but positive development during treatment was seen in nine patients, from no speech at baseline to producing sounds, letters, or a couple of words up to a developmental age of 15 months. Two patients developed no speech (1, 16); there was no change in speech or language skills during treatment in patients 8 and 12, the latter of whom also had severe hearing impairment.  Patients’ behavioral and social functioning was evaluated clinically by the neurologist—and a neuropsychologist and/or neuropsychiatrist if required—along with parental input.",44923749-5dab-4122-86bf-5e3fe7734dea

This patient had a dramatic decline in full-scale IQ from 83 at 5 years to 56 at 8 years, which—in addition to worsening ataxic symptoms—motivated the family to initiate treatment with KD. One year after KD start, the patient’s full-scale IQ had increased from 56 to 67 and remained stable throughout the second year of treatment, followed by a slow decline during the next 4 years of treatment to a full-scale IQ of 55, which was the same as baseline IQ. This neurocognitive decline after 2 years of treatment was associated with poor dietary compliance. Three patients (17, 18, 19) showed decline in full-scale IQ/GQ from baseline to last follow-up (Fig. 2).

Parents of eight patients replied, considering optimal plasma ketone levels as being >2 mmol/l, with a median of 3.3 (2.1–4.5) mmol/l. Almost all patients who were considered by investigators as being at least much improved had ketone levels of ∼3–3.5 mmol/l, as opposed to the remaining patients, with ketone levels <3 or >4 mmol/l.

24,discussion0,"We evaluated the effect of KD treatment in 19 pediatric patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency and found it effective and safe for the majority. Based on our results, KD efficacy is determined by two major variables: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency phenotype, and attainment and maintenance of ketosis. Patients with the most positive treatment outcomes were those with infantile or childhood disease onset. These patients experienced positive effects both clinically, i.e., in epilepsy, ataxia, and sleep disturbance, and in the development of motor and neurocognitive functioning. KD was less beneficial in patients with prenatal onset and minimal functioning upon diet initiation. In these patients, structural brain abnormalities began in utero, with permanent brain damage leading to profound mental retardation and spasticity, which cannot be reversed.",60e9d8de-eb63-4fe7-a340-243cfc33c05e
25,discussion1," These patients experienced positive treatment effects mostly in the areas of epilepsy, sleep, and social functioning.  The effect of KD in intractable epilepsy is well established, with half of the treated patients achieving >50% reduction in seizure frequency by 6 months of treatment (Hallböök et al. 2015). In our study, all patients with epileptic seizures at baseline improved during KD treatment. In half of them, seizures disappeared within 1 year after diet initiation.  The effect of KD on neurocognitive and social functioning in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency has not previously been assessed. In therapy-resistant epilepsy, treatment with KD has been associated with increased alertness and improved behavioral outcomes (Hallböök et al. 2007, 2012; Nordli et al. 2001; Pulsifer et al. 2001). Overall neurocognitive development was evaluated by the neuropsychologist as being at least minimally improved (11/12) in our study.",f0503aa9-de2e-40b1-87b1-5c9605d9ddec
26,discussion2," The cognitive decline seen in patients 17, 18, and 19; Fig. 2) was not indicative of cognitive impairment during treatment, as these patients did not lose previously acquired skills but, on the contrary, continued to develop cognitively during treatment, albeit at a lower rate than expected for their biological age. As pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency is a progressive neurological disease, untreated patients would be expected to lose previously acquired neurocognitive skills over time. We believe that treatment with KD counteracts this progressive neurodegeneration.  Our patients were alive at data registration, at a median age of 6 years. This is opposed to the poor survival outcomes shown in previous studies (DeBrosse et al. 2012; Patel et al. 2012; Wexler et al. 1997). The effect of KD on survival was investigated by DeBrosse et al., and no significant correlation was found (DeBrosse et al. 2012).",4c6a575d-2cd6-4082-a24c-3dc2779f78e4
27,discussion3," Our patients survived considerably longer than those in previous studies, which could be partly explained by the fact that they were mostly girls, as girls with early-onset disease survive longer than boys (DeBrosse et al. 2012); dietary treatment may also have contributed. However, the extent to which KD contributes longer survival is difficult to assess in our study or others due to lack of a control group.  Ketosis is considered to improve lactate levels in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency (Falk et al. 1976). This is also shown in our study, as blood lactate significantly declined after KD initiation. In order to be effective, KD treatment must lead to adequate and sustained ketosis. Wexler et al. proposed the level of ketosis as the most important variable in determining outcome of patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency (Wexler et al. 1997).",160ec12f-90bc-4375-b5b3-ce4c5452fc48
28,discussion4," Two patients in our study (8, 9) experienced periods of poor dietary compliance, which we consider to explain why patient 8 developed no new gross motor or language skills during treatment or improved in behavioral functioning. Patient 9 had periodically poor compliance, which was linked to episodic reappearance of ataxia and a slight cognitive decline.  To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study on long-term efficacy and safety outcomes of KD in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency. Based on our study, we propose that KD be introduced as early as possible upon diagnosing pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency, as early initiation may prevent further metabolic damage to the brain. The long-term effectiveness is highly dependent upon regular monitoring of plasma ketone levels and adjusting dietary composition to establish and sustain ketosis.
