0,methods0," 2.1. Subjects Recruitment  In the present research work, a total of 26 subjects were recruited at the Department of Experimental Clinical Medicine of the University of Foggia, aged between 23 and 56, of both sexes, and obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2). The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee 22 May 2018, n°440/DS, and conducted according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. These subjects underwent diet therapy in order to reduce body weight; they were also randomly divided into two groups: the first group (very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), Very Low Caloric Ketogenic Diet) included 13 subjects (mean BMI at T0 34.48 ± 3.",a6ed75ad-3a6d-45a3-8e1b-49238a85a6df
1,methods1,"85 kg/m2), who were administered a VLCK diet, following the instructions provided by the “Lignaform” weight loss program (Laboratoire Therascience, Monaco-Ville, Monaco); the second group (low caloric diet (LCD), Low Caloric Diet), on the other hand, included 13 subjects (average BMI at T0 33.4 ± 2.08 kg/m2), subjected to a conventional low-calorie diet; both diets have the same calorie intake (900 kcal).  The fundamental requirement was that the subjects to be enrolled were in a good condition of health, i.e., in a condition of pre-diabetes and/or first-degree hypertension, according to the guidelines of the ESH/ESC, 2007 (140–159/90–99 mmHg).",2f8657e9-17f9-4704-a052-3dc40a744684
2,methods2," In addition, 14 subjects were excluded in based on exclusion criteria such as: renal insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency, type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin, atrio-ventricular block, heart failure, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, unbalanced hypokalaemia, hypo-hyperthyroidism, chronic treatment with corticosteroid drugs, severe mental disorders, neoplasms, pregnancy, and lactation.  2.2. The Two Diet Programs  A total of 13 subjects were recruited for low caloric diet (LCD) diet programs. Participants in this group were assigned a balanced diet based on the following subdivision of macronutrients: 45–55% of carbohydrates, 15–25% of proteins, and 25–35% of fat; in addition, a dose of 20–40 g/day of fiber, in the form of fruits and vegetables, was recommended.",9c86f4b2-15be-4fa7-a64b-9a5f93d65310
3,methods3,"  The subjects recruited into the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group are 13 and followed a ketogenic diet based on the introduction of high biological value protein preparations and natural foods, according to the commercial weight loss program “Lignaform Method” (Therascience). Each protein preparation contains an average of 18 g of protein. The method involves 3 phases: the ketogenic phase, the glucose reintroduction phase, and the food balance phase. The first phase involves the assumption of a low-calorie diet (600–800 kcal/day), low in carbohydrates (<50 g/day of vegetables) and lipids (30 g/day of olive oil); as regards, instead, the quantity of proteins with a high biological value, it is calculated on the value of the ideal body weight, multiplied by a coefficient of 1.2 for the woman and 1.5 for the men, in order to avoid the loss of lean body mass.",7379e853-03f2-4f4c-bd94-ae6c18b8e79d
4,methods4," The ketogenic phase was, in turn, divided into a first phase, defined as the “active phase”, in which the subjects took 4/5 times a day the protein preparations with a high biological value and vegetables with a low glycemic index, and a second phase, defined as the “selective phase”, in which one of the daily protein portions is replaced with a protein meal consisting of natural foods (e.g., meat, fish, eggs). During the ketogenic phase, the subjects were provided with supplements based on vitamins and minerals (K, Na, Mg, Ca) and omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/day), in accordance with international recommendations. The ketogenic phase was maintained up to the achievement of 80% of the predetermined weight loss goal (10% of the starting weight); moreover, the duration of this first phase varied between 45 and 60 days, depending on the pre-established weight loss objectives and the conditions of each participant.",2bdda553-cc17-4381-b91c-a24d760ea552
5,methods5,"  In the second phase, the subjects begin to follow a low-calorie diet (low caloric diet (LCD)), through a progressive reintroduction of different groups of foods containing carbohydrates (in order: fruit, milk and derivatives, bread, pasta and legumes). This glucose reintroduction phase ends when the weight loss goal is reached, no later than 6 months from the start of the study.  Subsequently, in the third and last phase, all the subjects participating in the study were suggested to observe a dietary balance program, aimed at maintaining the lost weight in the long term.  2.3. Stages of the Study  For both groups, the trial, lasting a total of six months, was divided into 3 times:Time T0: initial phase in which the subjects are recruited and assigned to one or the other group.",b8aa32a0-c2bc-4bea-939c-47de35a5da1b
6,methods6," The subjects undergo a general medical examination and dietary evaluation by completing the food diary; instrumental evaluation of anthropometric parameters: BMI by weight measurement (b ilancia SECA, Tecnomed s.a.s., Verona, Italy, maximum capacity 150 Kg and approximation not exceeding 100 g) and height (SECA 711 stadiometer, Tecnomed s.a.s., Verona, Italy), body circumferences, skin folds; blood chemistry profile; analysis of the oxidation state by evaluating the plasma dosage of free radicals and endogenous antioxidant agents; electrocardiographic recording (electrocardiographic recording (ECG)) and measurement of heart rate variability (Heart rate variability (HRV)).  T1 time: period necessary to achieve weight loss by administering the appropriate diet.",76bdcdd0-e79c-4c28-b72c-cb8988dbd330
7,methods7," During this phase, subjects must reach 80% of the expected weight loss goal and, on a weekly basis, instrumental body composition checks are carried out by means of BIA, instrumental evaluation of anthropometric parameters and, only for the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group, verification of the permanence of the subjects in the condition of dietary ketosis is carried out by monitoring the plasma levels of β-hydroxybutyrate. At the end of this phase, the subjects of both groups are subjected to the repetition of the whole series of blood chemistry and instrumental tests proposed in phase 1.  Time T2: subjects belonging to both groups continue to follow the hypocaloric dietary regimen assigned to them until the predetermined weight loss is achieved. Even at the end of this phase, the subjects are subjected to the repetition of the battery of blood chemistry and instrumental tests carried out in the first two phases.",6ad03372-8a06-4b48-94b8-f14d1fa01cbc
8,methods8," Furthermore, in this last phase, all subjects are prescribed an aerobic exercise program at 60–70% of maximum heart rate, lasting 60–90 min and twice a week.  2.4. Heart Rate Variability (Heart rate variability (HRV))  Heart rate variability (Heart rate variability (HRV)) was assessed at times T0, T1, and T2 in all participating subjects using an electrocardiogram (electrocardiographic recording (ECG)). Before recording the electrocardiographic trace, the subjects were asked to stay in a quiet room for about 10 min. Two electrodes were then placed on the subject’s chest. electrocardiographic recording (ECG) activity was recorded for at least 5 min at a sampling rate of 500 Hz, using the BrainVision acquisition system (Brain Products GmbH, Gilching (Munich), Germany). People were asked to breathe normally while in a sitting position.  The Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis was then performed using the Kubios Heart rate variability (HRV) Version 2.",5caa7873-1ef3-437d-8bf6-b4caccd8a25a
9,methods9,"2 software (Biosignal Analysis and Medical Imaging Group, Department of Applied Physics University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland). Time domain and frequency analyses were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Electrophysiology. The time domain indices include: the mean interval RR (MeanRR); the standard deviation of the RR intervals (standard deviation of the RR intervals (SDNN)), which mainly evaluates the sympathetic activity of the long-term component of the Heart rate variability (HRV); the mean square root of successive differences in the RR interval (RR interval (RMSSD)), evaluating the short-term component of Heart rate variability (HRV), corresponding to parasympathetic activity.  Frequency domain indices include Low Frequency (LF, 0.04–0.15 Hz), reflecting simultaneous sympathetic activation and parasympathetic modulation; High Frequency (HF, 0.15–0.",66500caf-f026-4bf6-8152-5942be5ee3ab
10,methods10,"40 Hz), which is a measure of vagal control; Total Power (TP), which reflects the overall autonomic activity; the LF/HF ratio, which is a measure of the sympathovagal balance.  2.5. Statistical Analysis  Data were analyzed using Microsoft software, version 6.01 for Windows (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Analysis of variance for repeated measures (ANOVA) with post hoc Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) was used to determine the differences between the dependent variables. A post hoc test (Bonferroni) for multiple comparisons was performed to identify significant differences between groups. All data were reported as mean ± SE. Statistical significance was considered for p ≤ 0.05.  3. Results  Obese patients (BMI > 30) underwent two different diets: very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and low caloric diet (LCD). As shown in Figure 1, both diets resulted in a statistically significant reduction in BMI values, based on the three times analyzed (T0, T1, T2).",7f89a1c3-8d49-4565-977c-7e319b2c4978
11,methods11," In Table 1 are reported the principal characteristics of very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and low caloric diet (LCD) obese subjects before and after diet.  Analysis of variance showed significant effect both in the group following a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) diet (F (2.25) = 0.00000671, p < 0.01) and in the group following the low caloric diet (LCD) diet (F (2.25) = 0.001, p < 0.01). In addition, we found a statistical difference between T0 and T1 in both very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and low caloric diet (LCD) (p < 0.01) but not between T1 and T2.  Analyzing the heart rate (HR) in the two groups under examination (Figure 2), it emerges that, although in both groups the frequency trend appears almost similar (lowering of the HR at T1 compared T2), the variability is statistically significant only in the group subjected to a ketogenic diet, as suggested also by the t-test (F (2.25) = 0.008, p < 0.01).",2938ac9a-7d3e-48a5-bcf8-eb809d3a9196
12,methods12," These data, in agreement with what is described in the literature, reflects a higher HR value in obese subjects. In fact, if we compare the HR parameter with that of the BMI, we have a direct proportionality between the two values.  By evaluating the mean-RR parameter (temporal distance between two heartbeats, expressed in ms), the trend in the two groups is similar, with an increase at T1 and a reduction at T2 (Figure 3). However, this variability is statistically significant only in the group subjected to a ketogenic diet (F (2.25) = 0.003, p < 0.01).  Analyzing the HF parameter (Figure 4), we find, as expected, a trend similar to that of the RR variability, with a significance in the ketogenic diet group (F (2.25) = 0.002, p < 0.01).  Instead, by evaluating the sympathetic activity through the analysis of the LF (Figure 5), its variability is closely correlated with the HR: in fact, the trend is similar with a reduction at T1 and an increase in values at T2.",4bedb382-ee58-436e-9788-7bc2f323d5d4
13,methods13," However, this variability is statistically significant only for the group subjected to very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) (F (2.25) = 0.023, p < 0.05).  4. Discussion  This study intends to evaluate the impact of weight loss induced by a low carbohydrate diet (very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD)) and a conventional low-calorie diet (low caloric diet (LCD)) on the modulation of the cardiac autonomic nervous system and on the production of free radicals in obese subjects.  ANS makes an important contribution to the regulation of both the cardiovascular system and energy expenditure and is presumed to play a role in the pathophysiology of obesity and related complications [17,18,19]. Therefore, obesity and the autonomic nervous system are intrinsically related: a 10% increase in body weight is associated with a decline in parasympathetic tone, accompanied by an increase in average heart rate; conversely, weight reduction determines the decreased heart rate [20].",4cc80dda-ed68-4a9e-b4bc-a2e0fd72824f
14,methods14,"  Furthermore, signals related to food intake from various origins (e.g., intestine, hepatoportal area, baroreceptors) are integrated at the level of the central nervous system (CNS) and lead to an increase in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) at the peripheral level. In fact, the reduction in food intake and the loss of body weight leads to a reduction in sympathetic activity. On the other hand, the pathophysiological mechanisms of obesity involve alterations of the sympathetic nervous system in accordance with the “Mona Lisa Hypothesis” (Most Obesities kNown Are Low in Sympathetic Activity). Furthermore, parasympathetic influences on energy expenditure demonstrate that an increase in parasympathetic modulatory activity can induce a paradoxical improvement in energy consumption [21,22].  Analyzing the results, in both groups we found a reduction in heart rate, as an indicator of sympathetic activity, following the decrease in weight (T1) compared with the baseline (T0).",d0f72f95-8994-48fb-bbcc-6615dd13acd2
15,methods15," Consequently, always concurrently with the reduction in BMI, we observed an increase in the mean-RR parameter and an equally increase in HF (High Frequency), parasympathetic activity, synonymous with an increase in cardiac vagal modulation. From these results, we can deduce that weight loss is associated with an improvement in autonomic modulation through the enhancement of parasympathetic modulation, which clinically results in a decrease in heart rate. This is important because a higher heart rate is associated with increased mortality [23,24,25,26]  Furthermore, our study showed, in accordance with the studies cited above, that sympathetic activity (Low Frequency) is reduced in conjunction with caloric restriction and weight loss.  However, all observed parameters show a statistically significant variation only in the ketogenic diet group. Therefore, this study supports the notion that the sympathovagal balance can be modulated by a specific diet.",45092fc9-0f78-4d1b-a0da-4502d3fdc670
16,methods16,"  Furthermore, it is interesting to note how the values obtained in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group at time T2 (time at which the subjects reintroduced all foods containing carbohydrates into their diet) return to be comparable to those obtained at time T0. From these data, we can deduce that it is probably the condition of ketosis that determines the significant modulation of the variables [27,28,29,30].  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, our data indicate that the functional modulation of the autonomic nervous system in the obese is improved after weight reduction, particularly in subjects undergoing dietary ketosis. Considering these results, we can affirm that the peculiarity of the study was to underline the difference in autonomic activity induced by the two different dietary regimes, and it represents a strong point of our study.",eb13ccc6-0d09-4a66-ae7e-cda06f89171d
17,methods17," Considering these results, it could be deduced that the ketogenic diet may have effects on the increase in antioxidant capacity [31] and heart rate variability (Heart rate variability (HRV)).  However, the number of participants represents a limitation of the study; for this reason, further studies should be directed to reveal new aspects of the control exerted by the autonomic nervous system and the possible variation of oxidative stress in a greater number of subjects, so that they can be used for the prevention and treatment of obesity.
