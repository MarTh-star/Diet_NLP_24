0,background0,"Migraine causes the highest rate of headache-related disability and is one of the most prevalent non-fatal diseases with the third highest disease burden worldwide [1]. Despite great efforts to understand the pathophysiology of migraine and other primary headache disorders, the efficacy of current prophylactic treatments is often unsatisfactory because of the low responder rates (approximately half of patients) and adverse effects prompting cessation of therapy [2]. Therefore, innovative, more tolerated and effective treatments are needed (such as recently studied anti calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) antibodies [3]), and there is a critical need for non-pharmacological treatments [4, 5] that in many cases have specific pathophysiological targets [4–6]. Among these treatments, dietetic interventions play a relevant role.",bf527631-97a2-42e1-8beb-fe3d190e7a2f
1,background1," One of the most promising dietetic approaches is the so-called ketogenic diet (KD), characterised by a high fat and a low carbohydrate intake that induces a state of metabolic ketosis, i.e. hepatocytes conversion of fatty acids to ketone bodies (KBs) [7]. In recent years, our group observed a possible effect of a weight-loss (calorie-restricted) KD for migraine prophylaxis, consistent with a previous report [8]. In fact, we retrospectively described the case of a pair of twin sisters whose migraines improved during their weight-loss KD [9]. In subsequent prospective proof of concept studies, we confirmed our previous observation in migraineurs [10] and patients with chronic cluster headaches [11]. A possible explanation for this outcome could involve the concomitant treatment of comorbid metabolic conditions, such as obesity [12, 13], and insulin resistance [14, 15] that are described in migraineurs and are both improved by KDs that induce weight loss.",0e5ef0ea-5fac-41c7-bb4e-0aa744e84c38
2,background2," However, the mechanism of action of KD cannot be limited to treatment of the metabolic syndrome, particularly based on the observation that migraineurs without metabolic syndrome can also benefit. In addition, KD has been shown to be effective in other neurologic diseases through several other proposed mechanisms. For instance, the use of fasting for epilepsy dates back further than pharmacologic interventions and the KD which is designed to mimic fasting while maintaining adequate caloric intake is currently regarded as one of the preferred therapies for patients with drug resistant epilepsy [16], possibly caused by a diet-induced KB production causing modulation of cortical excitability [17, 18].",c03eb908-568d-4839-ba70-6c3048b41c46
3,background3," Aiming to understand mechanisms of KD clinical efficacy in migraine, we analysed the changes in cortical evoked potentials (EPs) in response to repeated visual and somatosensorial stimuli before and after 1-month on KD, during metabolic ketosis, and we observed a normalization of the baseline interictal deficit of habituation for both sensory modalities [19]. Whether the primary mechanism of action of KD in improving clinical and neurophysiological effects of migraine is solely based on alteration of activity in the cerebral cortex or the monoaminergic modulation of the nociceptive brainstem trigeminal system, which has been shown to play a pivotal role in the ignition of the migraine attack [20], remains to be determined.  The aim of this study thus is to investigate the function of the trigeminal system at the brainstem and cortical levels simultaneously in a group of migraineurs before and during KD, prospectively.",ae18ce3c-06f1-4e1b-aa32-1de525580318

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which there is a simultaneous recording of nBR and pain related evoked potentials (PREP), in order to assess the relationship between both evoked responses habituation and headache clinical features.",9acc4f99-a073-4476-96a4-b41e25b942df
24,discussion1,"  The most relevant finding of our study is that the response to trigeminal pain related evoked potentials (PREP) habituates during the KD, while the simultaneous recording of nBR elicited by the same trigeminal nociceptive stimuli does not habituate. The phenomenon of habituation is the “response decrement as a result of repeated stimulation” and regarded as a basic form of learning and memory [26]. Habituation is due to changes in neuronal excitability that reflects changes in the adaptive short- and long- term neural plasticity phenomena and is determined by underlying genetic characteristics [27–29].",4c5237d7-7a91-4cf0-b558-3b2b657adff4
25,discussion2," The described dissociation of habituation between pain related evoked potentials (PREP) and nBR during metabolic ketosis reflects the different origins of the elicited responses to the repetitive nociceptive stimuli: the origin of pain related evoked potentials (PREP) signal, although partially influenced by the brainstem, originates from cortical activity, whereas nBR is a pure brainstem response, not influenced by cortical activity. In fact, even if the expression of trigeminal pain related evoked potentials (PREP) is obviously influenced by subcortical structures (nerve root, brainstem and thalamus) the most prominent component of trigeminal pain related evoked potentials (PREP)s is generated by cerebral cortex [22]. and in particular the anterior cingulate cortex [30].",11d46c48-7ad4-4421-8269-cbce687d68c6
26,discussion3," The emotional processing related to pain strongly influences the genesis of pain related evoked potentials (PREP)s [31] possibly by modifying the balance between GABA and glutamate neurotransmission at the cortical level [32]. The results of our present study suggest that pain related evoked potentials (PREP) habituation deficits have a direct relationship with increased migraine severity. Lack of pain related evoked potentials (PREP) habituation worsens progressively with the subjective perception of severity of migraine and with the duration of migraine. Recent studies show that neural plasticity related to cortical pain processing can be influenced by brain derived neurotrophic factor (brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) [28]. In healthy humans, the habituation of pain related evoked potentials (PREP) is negatively influenced by a genetic polymorphism of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), associated with its reduced activity [28].",3f033911-92a1-4ce4-bf24-d0a311419c89
27,discussion4," This observation is pertinent to the present results because it is well known that ketosis increase the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by an epigenetic mechanism involving the KBs histone deacetylase inhibition [33]. Therefore, we propose as a possible neural mechanism by which metabolic ketosis induces an increase in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release which in turn normalizes the basic interictal pain related evoked potentials (PREP) lack of habituation and prevents migraine.  Another posssible mechanism of cortical activity normalization could be that KD influences the expression of cortical neurotransmitters, by KBs increase in tricarboxylic acid anaplerosis [34], leading to increased brain GABA (the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter) levels in humans [35], and lower levels of neuronal glutamate (the principal excitatory neurotransmitter) in rats [36].",7cf720aa-e7c8-455d-83bf-7a2d984d600d
28,discussion5," The biosyntesis of both neurotransmitters is connected because glutamate is the precursor of GABA. It is unclear why the majority of glutamate during ketosis follows the pathway of decarboxylation for the GABA biosynthesis, which subsequently modifies the ratio between the two neurotransmitters and creates an increase in overall cortical inhibition. However, we can also not exclude the possibility that anaplerosis leads to an higher biosinthesis of both GABA and glutamate, with the latter that is oxidated for energetic purposes [37] because of the reduction of glucose availability. In addition, regardless of ketone body concentrations, a high-fat diet increases the GABA levels in rat brains [38]. All these mechanisms lead to an increase in GABA concentration both in cells [39, 40] and synaptosomes [41], and the reduction of glutamate at presynaptic level [42].",63b05b64-1c66-4903-8245-0f2ad8d74482
29,discussion6," These changes which modify the GABA/glutamate balance, could account for normalization of cortical pain related evoked potentials (PREP), as well as normalization of cortical responses to other sensory modalities [19]. This proposed mechanism is very similar to the one implicated in the antiseizure action of the KD that involves decreased excitatory neurotransmitter release from presynaptic neurons [43, 44]. Additionally, beta-hydroxybutyrate (the most abundant of the three KBs) has been demonstrated to be a direct agonist for the type A receptors of GABA in Xenopus laevis oocytes [45], partially accounting for the reduced cortical excitability.  Moreover, it is well known that migraineurs brain shows impairment of oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial functioning, and energetic production [46–48].",0f9b9a2e-4ec4-4efe-be91-a1cc47984279
30,discussion7," Since neuronal excitability depends on energy metabolism, another possible explaination for the KD related cortical excitability normalization is the strengthening of mitochondrial biogenesis, energy metabolism [49], and energy production, by increasing the efficiency of the oxidative respiratory complex [50]. This leads to a more efficient synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity [51, 52].  On the contrary, nBR is mediated by a polysynaptic neural network mainly modulated by monoaminergic neurotransmitters (especially dopamine and serotonin) involving the spinal trigeminal nucleus, interneurons of the bulbo-pontine lateral reticular formation, and motoneurons of the facial nucleus innervating orbicularis oculi muscles [53, 54]. In a previous paper, we observed that the monoaminergic activity could influence evoked response at electrical nociceptive trigeminal stimulation.",06b9416f-15b9-4663-abb9-caadd6958afc
31,discussion8," In fact, in a patient with cluster headache, we observed a restoration of physiologic habituation of nBR during treatment with a dopamine agonist modulation [55]. Moreover, we observed that the genetic polymorphism of the MAOA (predicting for monoaminergic dysfunctions) was also able to affect the habituation of pain related evoked potentials (PREP), potentially by influencing the brainstem processing of stimuli before their projections to cortical structures [29]. The observation of a normalization of evoked responses as recorded at the cortex, but not at the brainstem level, could suggest that KBs activity is not relevant in terms of monoaminergic modulation, limiting its range of action only at the cortical level. Also the energetic improvement due to KD might have a minor role in the brainstem, since its energy requirement is smaller in the brainstem than in the cortex [56].",334bbbc7-6271-4817-8197-4e5974888e94
32,discussion9,"  The modification of cortical response to trigeminal nociceptive stimuli parallels the improvement in migraine clinical features, and is consistent with our previous findings observed recording other cortical EPs [19]. Thus, we further confirm that the normalization of habituation during the KD is a nonspecific response to repetitive stimuli of migraineurs’ cortices due to ketogenesis, irrespective of the modality of stimulation.  There are several potential limitations of this study. The study is not adequately powered to show a statistically significant clinical effect compared to placebo, only by within subject comparison. Only a well-designed randomized clinical trial will demonstrate the effectiveness of KD in prevention of migraine.",3d09fbd9-1fb9-4359-ac4a-9f4dcca4a786
33,discussion10," However, the aim of this study is – consistent with our previous observation [19] – to explore the early neurophysiologic changes induced by a short duration KD and the study was adequately powered to achieve the statistical significance in our observations. Moreover, unlike our previous analogous study [19], to limit possible confounding factors we restricted our observation only in a homogeneous group of patients with migraine without aura that underwent to a normo-caloric diet and did not lose their weight during the month on KD (Table 2). Additionally, we cannot exclude that other mechanisms not related to metabolic ketosis (for instance, lowering the activity of the so-called nutrient-integrating pathways or the lack of fluctuations of glucose and insulin blood levels) [57] could account for the results we have observed.",2e1c9975-ac5f-44f1-844d-d7d4ccce8887
34,discussion11," Nonetheless, one could argue that two recordings, the 1st before and the 2nd after KD, could be not enough to verify the potential changes induced through the diet and then we need many more recordings after KD (days or months after KD). However, what we did (recording only ones after the intervention) is perfectly in line with most of the literature using neurophysiology and neuroimaging techniques to investigate mechanisms of action of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions [58–68].  Related to the electrophysiological methodologies, 5 per block averaged stimuli could be not enough to measure stable relevant pain related evoked potentials (PREP) components, although previous papers reliably assessed pain related evoked potentials (PREP) amplitude and habituation by averaging blocks composed from 3 trails [69].",9cf6b638-fd87-4c07-8467-efbb170659ad
35,discussion12," Finally, we must highlight that there has been some controversy regarding the reliability of pain related evoked potentials (PREP) evoked by electric stimuli upon that evoked by laser stimuli to test nociception [70]. According to a multichannel scalp recording study, both laser-evoked (laser evoked (LEP)) and electrical-concentric trigeminal potentials are similar in amplitude, morphology, and topographic cortical representations, but different in latency, so that Authors conclude that cortical potentials evoked by electric stimulation are contaminated by A-beta non-nociceptive fibre coactivation [70]. Further study using laser evoked (LEP)s to assess more selectively pain processing in migraineurs treated with KD is needed in order to confirm our present data.",a633348e-f16d-4a54-aa14-8033ff8ba8e8
36,discussion13,"  Conclusions In summary, our study confirms that in migraineurs on a ketogenic diet, the typical interictal deficit of habituation of evoked responses to repeated electric painful trigeminal stimuli can normalize, but only at cortical levels (as measured by the recording of pain related evoked potentials (PREP)s), not in the brainstem (studied by the nBR analysis). These findings suggest that the cerebral cortex may be the primary site of KD-related modulation.
