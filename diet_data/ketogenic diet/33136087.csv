0,discussion0," After an extensive literature review, we were unable to identify any other reported cases with an association with both WD and GLUT1 deficiency. These two disorders have different genetic modes of inheritance and two different loci on two different chromosomes. Simultaneous occurrence of an autosomal dominant disorder with an autosomal recessive disorder is extremely rare, especially with no history of consanguinity in the family. The presence of GLUT1 deficiency in our patient is most likely due to a de novo mutation, as a great number of de novo mutations occur in dominant genetic disorders (10). Moreover, the presence of WD in our patient could be related to parents coming from different countries of origin but Hispanic in nature.",6492930a-77ea-49ce-b059-5ff4aad5b8cb
1,discussion1,"  Based on this patient's age of presentation and hepatic and neurological involvement, metabolic liver disorders including mitochondrial depletion syndrome (mitochondrial depletion syndrome (MDS)) and Niemann-Pick disease type C (Niemann Pick disease type C (NPC)) must be included in the differential diagnosis. mitochondrial depletion syndrome (MDS) is associated to a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by a reduction in mitochondrial DNA, thus limiting energy production in several organs including the musculoskeletal, liver, and brain. Presentation includes seizures, hypotonia, developmental delay, feeding problems, and liver dysfunction (11). Moreover, Niemann Pick disease type C (NPC) is a lysosomal disorder whose presentation is age-dependent, progressing from early perinatal and infantile liver involvement to hypotonia, developmental delay, ataxia, seizures, and psychiatric manifestations (12). Both disorders are diagnosed by molecular genetic testing.",098f6a55-9480-46df-95f8-3f7577089b59
2,discussion2,"  This patient's early developmental delay presentation led to an extensive neurological workup and diagnosis of paroxysmal exertional dyskinesia with a seizure component secondary to GLUT1 deficiency. Cerebellar ataxia might present later in life in almost 30% of WD patients. These patients can present with an ataxic gait (wide-based gait with tandem walking), intentional tremor, dysdiadochokinesis, impaired coordination of fine hand movements, and ataxic speech (13–15). Moreover, KF rings, a copper deposition at the cornea's Descemet membrane, appear in 90–100% of patients with WD and neurological and psychiatric symptoms in >10 years of age (6). However, such type of ataxia and ocular findings were not seen in our patient.  Although pediatric WD commonly presents in the first decade of life, WD's neurological symptoms are mostly observed in the second decade (16, 17). Therefore, his neurological symptoms were most likely secondary to GLUT1 deficiency.",bd2f90df-20bc-4422-9c3e-eb58766122bd
3,discussion3," GLUT 1 serves as a transporter in the central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)), and, in its absence, the patient will present with a normal blood glucose concentration and a CSF glucose concentration of <60 mg/dL (1). The prognosis of GLUT1 deficiency varies, but most respond well to a ketogenic diet. A ketogenic diet comprises a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet, which maintains ketosis and allows the brain to use the ketone bodies as an alternative energy source. Ketogenic diets are currently considered the sole treatment for those with GLUT1 deficiency (2, 18). Liver enzymes alongside abdominal ultrasonography need to be closely monitored as studies have shown that a long-term ketogenic diet can induce parenchymal liver injury, hepatic steatosis, and formation of gallstones (19).  Moreover, our patient had elevated liver enzymes prior to initiation of ketogenic diet, likely related to WD and not usually consistent with GLUT1 deficiency.",77466299-1bce-485a-881a-2e2c456004c3
4,discussion4," WD is caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a copper transporting P-type ATPase necessary for copper excretion through the plasma and the bile. ATP7B is highly expressed in the liver but is also found in other organs such as the kidney, placenta, mammary glands, brain, and lung (5). If such a defect exists in the ATP7B gene, it can lead to a progressive toxic copper accumulation in these organs. Most children with WD present with liver disease manifesting with incidental and asymptomatic elevated liver enzymes, hepatomegaly, acute hepatitis, or cirrhosis. If WD is not appropriately diagnosed and treated, such copper accumulation can lead to liver failure and/or irreversible brain damage (7). Therefore, WD must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with unexplained elevated liver enzymes, in the presence of another confirmed genetic condition since delay in diagnosis will delay early treatment.",6ece9a74-354b-49e2-a2ba-2ba6ce3096be
5,discussion5," Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of performing genetic sequencing of the ATP7B gene in the initial investigation (20).  Conclusion  This case highlights the importance of carefully evaluating a patient with an unexplained liver disorder, even in the presence of primary neurological disease, as it can have significant therapeutic implications.
