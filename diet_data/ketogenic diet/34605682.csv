15,results0," Diets enriched in SFAs increase endotoxemia severity and mortality  To examine the immune effects of chronic exposure to diets enriched in SFAs on lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS))-induced endotoxemia, we fed age matched (6–8 weeks), female BALB/c mice either with a WD (enriched in SFAs and sucrose), a KD (enriched in SFAs and low-carbohydrate), or standard chow (SC; low in SFAs and sucrose), for 2 weeks (Supplementary file 1). We defined 2 weeks of feeding as chronic exposure, because this is correlated with WD- or KD-dependent microbiome changes and confers metaflammation in WD mice , sustained altered blood glucose levels in WD mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), and elevated levels of ketones in the urine and blood in KD mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C). We then induced endotoxemia by a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS).",4efaf6d9-deeb-4273-a5fa-774d07759b0f
16,results1," We measured hypothermia as a measure of disease severity and survival to determine outcome (Napier et al., 2019; Napier et al., 2016; Saito et al., 2003). WD- and KD-fed mice showed significant and prolonged hypothermia, starting at 10 hr post-injection (p.i.), compared to the SC-fed mice (Figure 1A). In accordance with these findings, WD- and KD-fed mice displayed 100% mortality by 26 hr p.i. compared to 100% survival of SC-fed mice (Figure 1B). Hypoglycemia is a known driver of endotoxemia, and each of these diets has varying levels of sugars and carbohydrates (Supplementary file 1; Raetzsch et al., 2009; Filkins and Cornell, 1974). However, mice in all diet groups displayed similar levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hypoglycemia during disease (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D), indicating that potential effects of diet on blood glucose were not a driver of enhanced disease severity.

Considering mice fed KD experience a shift toward nutritional ketosis, we wanted to understand if our phenotype was dependent on nutritional ketosis. 1,3-butanediol (BD) is a compound that induces ketosis by enhancing levels of the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate in the blood . Age matched (6–8 weeks), female BALB/c mice were fed for 2 weeks with KD, SC supplemented with saccharine and 1,3-butanediol (SC + BD), or SC-fed with the saccharine vehicle solution (SC + Veh). BD supplementation was sufficient to increase blood ketones (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). We next injected lipopolysaccharide (LPS) i.p.",afc9fa40-3d3f-47b0-a110-49e467dfb711
22,results7," and found KD-fed mice showed significantly greater hypothermia, and increased mortality, compared to SC + BD and SC + Veh (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F). Though short-lived, when compared to SC + Veh, the SC + BD mice did confer an increase in hypothermia, suggesting that nutritional ketosis may play a minor role in KD-dependent susceptibility to endotoxemia (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F). Together these data suggest that diets enriched in SFAs promote enhanced acute endotoxemia severity, and this is independent of diet-dependent hypoglycemic shock or nutritional ketosis.  Diets enriched in SFAs induce a hyper-inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased immunoparalysis  Endotoxemia mortality results exclusively from a systemic inflammatory response characterized by an acute increase in circulating inflammatory cytokine levels (e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, and IL-1β) from splenocytes and myeloid-derived innate immune cells (Lewis et al.",67ab955b-0439-4637-a4d6-21e95bf2aa94
23,results8,", 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Radzyukevich et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2012). Additionally, pre-treatment of myeloid-derived cells with dietary SFAs has been shown to enhance inflammatory pathways in response to microbial ligands . Considering this, we hypothesized that exposure to enriched systemic dietary SFAs in WD- and KD-fed mice would enhance the inflammatory response to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during the acute inflammatory response. 5 hr p.i., age matched (6–8 weeks), female BALB/c mice fed all diets showed induction of Tnf, Il6, and Il1b expression in the blood (Figure 1C–E). However, at 5 hr p.i., WD- and KD-fed mice experienced significantly higher expression of Tnf and Il6 in the blood, compared with SC-fed mice, and WD-fed mice also showed significantly higher Il1b expression (Figure 1C–E), indicating that diets enriched in SFAs are associated with a hyper-inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS).",b8ae149d-813c-4221-b169-4cecdca5dac3
24,results9,"  Importantly, septic patients often present with two immune phases: an initial amplification of inflammation, followed by or concurrent with an induction of immune suppression (immunoparalysis), that can be measured by a systemic increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 . Furthermore, in septic patients, a high IL-10:tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ratio equates with the clinical immunoparalytic phase and correlates with poorer sepsis outcomes (Gogos et al., 2000; van Dissel et al., 1998). Interestingly, we found there was significantly increased Il10 expression in WD- and KD-fed mice, compared to SC-fed mice (Figure 1F), and WD- and KD-fed mice had significantly higher Il10:Tnf ratios at 10–20 hr and 15–20 hr, respectively, compared to SC-fed mice (Figure 1G).",439989ca-45e3-4775-8f55-b3654b0300c3
25,results10," These data conclude that mice exposed to diets enriched in SFAs show an initial hyper-inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by an increased immunoparalytic phenotype, which correlates with enhanced disease severity, similar to what is seen in the clinic.  Diets enriched in SFAs drive enhanced responses to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) independent of diet-associated microbiome  We have previously shown that WD-fed mice experience increased endotoxemia severity and mortality, independent of diet-associated microbiome . In order to confirm the increases in disease severity that correlated with KD were also independent of KD-associated microbiome changes, we used a germ-free (GF) mouse model. 19–23-week-old female and 14–23-week-old male and female GF C57BL/6 mice were fed SC, WD, and KD for 2 weeks followed by injection with 50 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), our previously established LD50 in GF C57BL/6 mice .",582da2bd-94b9-4603-b846-cc30d389ebc0
26,results11," As we saw in the conventional mice, at 10 hr p.i. WD- and KD-fed GF mice showed enhanced hypothermia and mortality, compared to SC-fed GF mice (Figure 1H, I). These data show that, similar to WD-fed mice, the KD-associated increase in endotoxemia severity and mortality is independent of diet-associated microbiome.  Our previous studies (Figure 1A–G) in conventional mice were carried out in 6–8-week female mice on a BALB/c background. Importantly, genetic background and age differences can have large effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment outcome. The GF mice used in this study (Figure 1H–N) were on a C57BL/6 background, between the ages of 14 and 23 weeks. Thus, we confirmed WD- and KD-fed conventional C57BL/6 mice aged 20–21 weeks old show enhanced disease severity and mortality in an lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia model (4.5 mg/kg), compared to mice fed SC, similar to what is seen in younger BALB/c mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, H).",bf97233d-e6c8-4e61-9771-7661d18cc315
27,results12,"  Additionally, to confirm that the hyper-inflammatory response to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was independent of the WD- and KD-dependent microbiome, we measured systemic inflammation during endotoxemia via the expression of Tnf, Il6, and Il1b in the blood at 0–10 hr p.i. We found, WD- and KD-fed GF mice displayed enhanced expression of Tnf and Il1b at 5–10 hr, and significantly enhanced expression of il-6 at 5 hr, compared to SC-fed GF mice (Figure 1J–L). Interestingly, Il10 expression and the Il10:Tnf ratio were not significantly different throughout all diets, suggesting the SFA-dependent enhanced immunoparalytic phenotype is dependent on the diet-associated microbiomes in WD- and KD-fed mice (Figure 1M–N). These data demonstrate that the early hyper-inflammatory response, but not the late immunoparalytic response, to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) associated with enriched dietary SFAs is independent of the diet-dependent microbiota.",3594f4cf-0e2f-4e11-be43-ccc478dd2b50
28,results13,"  A diet enriched exclusively in SFAs induces trained immunity  Thus far we find feeding diets enriched in SFAs (WD and KD) leads to enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines in the blood after treatment with systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), suggesting that the SFAs may be inducing an innate immune memory response that leads to a hyper-inflammatory response to secondary challenge. Specifically, trained immunity is an innate immune memory response characterized by reprogramming of myeloid cells by a primary inflammatory stimulus, that then responds more robustly to secondary inflammatory challenge. Trained immunity has been shown to mediate cell sub-types within the HSC compartment that gives rise to “trained” myeloid progeny for weeks to years (De Zuani and Frič, 2022).",8f67418a-1ad1-41b0-b8fe-559b59a6ac2c
29,results14," A previous study in Ldlr−/− mice has shown 4 weeks of WD feeding significantly enhances multipotent progenitors (multipotent progenitor (MPP)s) and granulocyte and monocyte precursors (GMPs) and skews development of GMPs toward a monocyte lineage that is primed to respond with a hyper-inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) . Currently, it is unknown if diets enriched in SFAs fed to WT mice can induce changes within the HSC compartment or long-lasting trained immunity.  In order to determine the impact of dietary SFAs on bone marrow reprogramming in vivo, we next evaluated HSCs and progenitor cells via flow cytometry from age-matched (6–8 weeks) female WT BALB/c mice fed SC, WD, and KD for 2 weeks. Using previously published panels for analyzing HSC populations in the bone marrow (Kaufmann et al., 2018; Vazquez et al., 2015; Nowlan et al.",9b6bfd15-3ab4-46c9-b555-a98bd3144b7e
30,results15,", 2020), we collected bone marrow and measured relative proportions of long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs; CD201+CD27+CD150+CD48−), short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs; CD201+CD27+CD150+CD48+), and multipotent progenitor (MPP)s (CD201+CD27+CD150−CD48+) (Figure 2A and B). Strikingly, we find that KD-fed mice showed significantly enhanced ST- and LT-HSCs, and multipotent progenitor (MPP)s compared to SC-fed mice (Figure 2C). Unlike previously reported in Ldlr−/− mice, there was no significant change in ST-HSCs, LT-HSCs, or multipotent progenitor (MPP)s within WD-fed WT mice (Figure 2C). Furthermore, we did not see a significant increase in multipotent progenitor (MPP)3s for WD-fed mice, as previously published for Ldlr−/− mice , or KD-fed mice; however, this may be due to the difference in genetic backgrounds, or length of diet administration (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A).",f3822291-7f03-456a-895d-bacb27e537c6

Thus, we wanted to assess if enriched dietary SFA induces in vivo reprogramming of monocytes and splenocytes, leading to an enhanced response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ex vivo. First, we fed age-matched (6–8 weeks) female BALB/c mice SC, WD, or KD for 2 weeks, isolated bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) via magnetic negative selection using bone marrow extracted from femurs and tibias, and determined baseline expression of inflammatory cytokines. We found that prior to ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, BMMs isolated from mice fed SC, WD, or KD showed no significant difference in Tnf expression, and Il6 expression was significantly decreased in BMMs from KD-fed mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C).",15db7416-4f91-4685-a24e-9b8b3ccb218a

Similarly, we isolated splenocytes from SC-, WD-, and KD-fed mice and found no difference between homeostatic inflammation of splenocytes between diets, but a significantly enhanced expression of Tnf in the splenocytes of KD-fed mice, and not WD-fed mice, challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (2 hr) compared to splenocytes from SC-fed mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, F).  These data show the KD stimulates expansion of HSC populations and skew differentiation of myeloid progenitors that then give rise to macrophages with enhanced inflammatory potency (Figure 2A–E; Figure 2—figure supplement 2).",cf02f9b0-452f-426e-afd8-97c7b1de83b1
39,results24," Furthermore, these data suggest that BMDMs, BMMs, and splenocytes from WD- and KD-fed mice are not more inflammatory at homeostasis; however, when challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), KD feeding confers a hyper-inflammatory response. Together, our results suggest the KD, a diet that comprised 90.5% SFAs, leads to reprogramming of the HSC compartment and long-lasting trained immunity.  PA and PA-associated fatty acids are enriched in the blood of KD-fed mice  It is known that the SFAs consumed in the diet determine the SFA profiles in the blood (Dougherty et al., 1987; Skeaff et al., 2006; Zöllner and Tatò, 1992), and that these SFAs have the potential to be immunomodulatory. Thus, we next wanted to identify target SFAs enriched in the blood of mice fed a diet exclusively enriched in SFAs that may be altering the systemic inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS).",9bc68c1f-d414-4c5e-90b6-90d15af11f14
40,results25," Considering that the KD is enriched in SFAs and not sucrose, and that KD-fed mice showed distinct HSC alterations and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hyper-inflammation in BMDMs, BMMs, and splenocytes treated ex vivo, the subsequent studies were performed exclusively on KD-fed mice. We used mass spectrometry lipidomics to create diet-dependent profiles of circulating fatty acids in SC- and KD-fed mice . Age matched (6–8 weeks), female BALB/c mice were fed SC or KD for 2 weeks, then serum samples were collected and analyzed using qualitative tandem liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry. We used principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) to visualize how samples within each data set clustered together according to diet, and how those clusters varied relative to one another in abundance levels of free fatty acids (free fatty acids (FFA)), triacylglycerols (triacylglycerols (TAG)), and phosphatidylcholines (PC).",0eeb9bda-0158-4e14-bbef-4362092e7e73

Similarly, the relative abundance of SGs in SC- and KD-fed mice displayed unique diet-dependent profiles with no overlapping clusters, and abundance of specific SGs was significantly higher in the serum of KD-fed mice compared to SC-fed mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B).",2184d132-90bb-4151-b617-2bdf51f0ff11

Additionally, PA-containing triacylglycerols (TAG)s and PCs were significantly elevated in KD-fed mice serum, compared to SC-fed mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D).

50,results35,"  PA enhances macrophage inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)  Many groups have shown that PA alone induces a modest, but highly reproducible increase in the expression and release of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and monocytes (Lancaster et al., 2018; Korbecki and Bajdak-Rusinek, 2019). However, it remains unknown if PA can act as a primary inflammatory stimulus to induce a hyper-inflammatory response to a secondary heterologous stimulus in primary cells. Thus, we next wanted to determine if pre-exposure to physiologically relevant concentrations of PA altered the macrophage response to a secondary challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Current literature indicates a wide range of serum PA levels, between 0.3 and 4.1 mM, reflects a high-fat diet in humans (Abdelmagid et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Gallego et al., 2018; Buchanan et al., 2021; Perreault et al., 2014).",abbf0519-e957-4a0e-bd6d-3d30ac2ecd04

Importantly, PA treatment can induce apoptosis and pyroptosis in various cell types (Borradaile et al., 2006; Li et al., 2018; Ly et al., 2017; Tao et al., 2021); however, we found only an average of 3.4 and 4.4% of cell death after a 12-hr or 24-hr incubation, respectively, with PA (1 mM) and subsequent 24 hr of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment or control media (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A, B). These data demonstrate PA pre-treatment of macrophages induces a hyper-inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) independent of cell death, suggesting PA is sensitizing macrophages to secondary inflammatory challenge.",bc3e2dfb-eff7-4af1-a2b4-42d8bc481048
54,results39,"  Thus, we conclude that both 12- and 24-hr pre-treatments with 0.5 mM or 1 mM of PA conjugated to 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) are sufficient to induce reprogramming of macrophages and alter the response to stimulation with a heterologous ligand. Additionally, these data demonstrate that even serum concentrations of PA that are at the lower end of the spectrum for humans consuming a high-fat diet pose a risk for inflammatory dysfunction.  Diverting ceramide synthesis inhibits the PA-dependent hyper-inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in macrophages  PA treatment of various cell types diverts cellular metabolism toward the synthesis of the toxic metabolic byproducts: diacylglycerols and ceramide .

56,results41,"  PA is sufficient to increase endotoxemia severity and systemic hyper-inflammation  Considering the drastic effect of PA on macrophage response to secondary challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we next wanted to understand if exposure to PA alone is sufficient to induce a hyper-inflammatory response during endotoxemia in vivo. We answered this question using age-matched (6–8 weeks) female BALB/c mice fed SC for 2 weeks, by mimicking systemic PA levels found in serum of humans on high-fat diet via a single i.p. injection of ethyl palmitate (750 mM), and then after 12 hr, challenging with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) i.p. . Similar to previous publications, we find that a 750-mM i.p. injection of ethyl palmitate enhances free PA levels in the serum to 173–425 μM compared to Veh-treated mice with 110–250 μM (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A).",1963d1db-3de9-45e0-bfb6-11811273cb5b
57,results42," Important to note, free PA is only transiently enhanced by systemic application and is quickly (<1 hr) taken up by peripheral tissues; thus, our detected free serum levels are most likely an underestimation of transient systemic PA (Black, 2007; Mansbach and Gorelick, 2007; Karavolos et al., 2008).  Interestingly, after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, PA-treated mice experienced increased disease severity as indicated by their significant decline in temperature compared to Veh mice (Figure 4A). Similar to WD- and KD-fed mice, PA-treated mice also exhibited enhanced mortality, compared to Veh mice (Figure 4B). Importantly, mice injected with PA for shorter time periods (0, 3, and 6 hr) and then challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not exhibit increased disease severity or poor survival outcome (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C), concluding that a 12-hr pre-treatment with PA is required for an increase in disease severity.

63,results48," Thus, exposure to PA to mimic systemic levels found in humans eating high-fat diets is sufficient to drive enhanced inflammation and disease severity in mice stimulated with endotoxin, and this effect is dependent on length of PA exposure.  PA induces long-lived hyper-responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and enhanced clearance of fungal infection  Our data show that pre-treatment with systemic PA alone enhances endotoxemia severity in vivo and inflammatory responses of macrophages to a secondary and heterologous stimulus in vitro. This form of regulation resembles trained immunity; however, it remains unclear if PA is inducing trained immunity in vivo. We first evaluated the basal level expression of Tnf, Il6, and Il1b in mice treated with 750 mM of PA or Veh i.p. for 12 hr, before stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).",03c676f4-5729-4abd-9114-df7e2c18340c
64,results49," Interestingly, we did not see significant differences in Tnf, Il6, or Il1b expression at 12 hr of exposure with PA (Figure 4F), which suggests that circulating immune cells of these mice is not in a primed state at these time points prior to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. These data suggest PA induces trained immunity, and not priming; however, the time point of initial inflammation induced by PA remains unknown.  As mentioned previously, canonical inducers of trained immunity (e.g. Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) or β-glucan) induce long-lived enhanced innate immune responses to secondary inflammatory stimuli (Kaufmann et al., 2018, Netea et al., 2020). Thus, we hypothesized that exposure to a PA bolus would enhance disease severity and mortality in mice, and that this phenotype would persist even after mice were rested from PA injections for 1 week. We injected age matched (6–8 weeks), female BALB/c mice fed SC with a vehicle solution (Veh→SC) or PA (750 mM; PA→SC) i.p.",653a2463-89c1-45af-acdd-1eb4e7bbc522

When challenged with systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), PA→SC showed an increase in disease severity and mortality compared to Veh→SC mice (Figure 4G and H), indicating that PA alone can induce long-lived trained immunity that increases susceptibility to inflammatory disease. Importantly, the difference between Veh→SC and PA→SC survival was not significant (Figure 4H), suggesting PA is not the sole driver of the enhanced mortality we see in KD.  Lastly, the most commonly studied models for inducing trained immunity are immunization with Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) or stimulation with β-glucan, and they have been shown to protect mice from systemic Candida albicans infection via lymphocyte-independent immunological reprogramming that leads to decreased kidney fungal burden . Therefore, we next tested if PA treatment induces lymphocyte-independent clearance of C. albicans infection.",552aae83-2f9e-4177-b3c7-4d4446031cc7
66,results51," For these experiments, Rag1 knockout (Rag1−/−) mice were treated with a vehicle or PA solution for 12 hr and subsequently infected intravenously (i.v.) with 2×106 C. albicans. In accordance with canonical trained immunity models, mice treated with PA for 12 hr showed a significant decrease in kidney fungal burden compared to Veh mice, 24 hr post-infection (Figure 4I). These are the first data to suggest PA enhances innate immune clearance of C. albicans in vivo.  OA reverses enhanced disease severity in WD- and KD-fed mice  We have reported here that diversion of ceramide synthesis reverses the PA-dependent hyper-inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in macrophages in vitro (Figure 3K–M). Interestingly, OA (C18:1) is a mono-unsaturated fatty acid naturally found in animal fats and vegetable oils, and in the presence of PA, diverts lipid metabolism away from ceramide production .",013274ba-9da5-4496-aaf1-281f9c3b10da

72,discussion0," In this study, we showed that mice-fed diets enriched in SFA exhibit hyper-inflammation during endotoxemia and poorer outcomes, compared with mice fed a standard low-SFA diet, independent of the diet-associated microbiome, ketosis, and the impact of each diet on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hypoglycemia (Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Strikingly, we found that before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, healthy mice fed a diet solely enriched in SFAs (KD) displayed significant expansion of HSCs, including multipotent progenitor (MPP)s, and harbored BMDMs, BM monocytes, and splenocytes that were not inherently more inflamed, but when challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exhibited increased production of inflammatory cytokines (Figure 2; Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Since  we did not confer the hyper-inflammatory phenotype in BMDMs, BMMs, and splenocytes with WD, but only from KD-fed mice, and (Kleinnijenhuis et al.",c647df3f-ca28-4070-ae1c-03cd86230466
73,discussion1,", 2012) the KD is only enriched in SFAs and contains no sucrose, allowing us to ask questions specifically about SFAs, we chose to focus on the KD for the remainder of the study.  Considering the immunogenic properties of some dietary SFAs enriched in the KD, and that excess dietary SFAs are found circulating throughout the blood and peripheral tissues, we used lipidomics to identify dietary SFAs that may be directly reprogramming innate immune cells to respond more intensely to secondary inflammatory stimuli. Our study identified enriched PA (C16:0; PA) and PA-associated fatty acids in the blood of KD-fed mice (Figure 3; Figure 3—figure supplement 1). And, when we treated macrophages with physiologically relevant concentrations of PA, we found that PA alone induces a hyper-inflammatory response to secondary challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Figure 3; Figure 3—figure supplement 2).",46ec7745-03f2-4fe6-9ecb-72038fdcbbe4
74,discussion2," This enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines in response to secondary heterologous stimuli has been shown in previous models of innate immune memory, specifically trained immunity (Saeed et al., 2014; Christ et al., 2018; Bekkering et al., 2014). Furthermore, our data suggests PA induces trained immunity by showing that circulating inflammatory levels in PA-injected mice were not upregulated or in a primed state prior to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in vivo (Figure 4F), and PA-associated enhanced endotoxemia severity and mortality are still shown in mice rested for 7 days post-PA exposure (Figure 4G–H). Importantly, we have not fully defined the initial inflammatory response to PA in our model, thus our data only suggests trained immunity is induced by PA exposure. However, we do find that PA exacerbates the acute phase of endotoxin challenge and correlates with increased mortality but also enhances resistance to infection independent of mature lymphocytes (Figure 4).",dfd1b081-5b49-46fb-89f6-811180235e0d
75,discussion3," Together, our data concludes PA exposure can lead to hallmark phenotypes associated with canonical trained immunity models in vitro and in vivo.  Interestingly, the in vivo blood expression of cytokines for KD-fed mice following endotoxin challenge is mild in comparison to the cytokine secretion we show for BM monocytes, splenocytes, and BMDMs isolated from KD-fed mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ex vivo (Figure 1; Figure 2; Supplementary file 2). The media used for culturing and treating BM monocytes and splenocytes ex vivo with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contained a high-glucose concentration (4.5 g/L; 25 mM). However, high-glucose media does not alter tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, or IL-1β secretion, or mitochondrial metabolic activity, in WT BMDMs treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) following 7 days of differentiation in high-glucose media .",abd344bd-c4c0-486f-ae91-71b1be9f7d1a
76,discussion4," Additionally, in these studies, metabolic adaptation likely takes place within 48 hr for BMDMs cultured in high-glucose media ; thus, we suggest it is unlikely that high glucose contributed to the significant augmentation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6 secretion for BMDMs from KD-fed mice compared to controls, following 7 days of differentiation in high-glucose media prior to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. However, further studies on the metabolic flexibility of the SC- and KD-BMDMs will be required to answer this question directly.  Additionally, we have previously shown that WD-induced weight gain does not correlate with enhanced endotoxemia severity and mortality in conventional mice .",e8aecc10-3403-4d80-8b0e-44d4a0ac2546
77,discussion5," This is important to address because of the “obesity paradox” that describes the diversity in sepsis severity and mortality exhibited within the obese patient population, with some studies showing that obesity may even be protective in certain disease contexts (Ng and Eikermann, 2017). Humans on an animal-based KD that contains 76% fat with 30% SFA content, and 10% carbohydrates, experience ketosis within 1–2 weeks characterized by a three- to fourfold elevation in blood BHB levels and exhibit greater energy expenditure and weight loss compared to humans on a low-fat, plant-based diet that contains 10% fat and 75% carbohydrates . Likewise, KD-fed mice do not gain weight but show enhanced energy expenditure after 5 weeks of diet administration, and a trend toward weight loss during 9 weeks of diet exposure, compared to mice fed an SC diet .",523f3dd8-b24f-4e38-9a74-6111368b3316
78,discussion6," Thus, neither weight gain nor the obesity paradox is the confounding feature for the data we present here showing that both KD and dietary PA mediate innate immune memory in vivo during endotoxemia.  Furthermore, the metabolism of dietary SFAs is a key element of immune system function, and metabolic intermediates enhanced by SFAs and PA alone, such as ceramide, serve as signaling lipids in diseases of inflammation . Mechanistically, we show that inhibiting ceramide synthesis or diverting metabolism away from ceramide synthesis using OA protects macrophages from PA-induced trained immunity, suggesting that dietary intervention may help regulate inflammatory dysregulation during disease (Figure 5). And, to complement our in vitro mechanistic findings we show that three single i.p. injections of OA prior to endotoxin stimulation protects KD-fed mice from enhanced disease severity and mortality (Figure 5).",4c8e9325-e86a-4f9b-88d1-8367e2b84a82
79,discussion7,"  Our findings align with the growing body of evidence indicating that trained immunity is a double-edged sword, where the phenomenon can be beneficial for resistance to infection but detrimental in the context of diseases exacerbated by systemic inflammation . Specifically, we show that PA-induced memory is beneficial in that it promotes clearance of C. albicans infection in the kidneys of Rag1−/− mice (Figure 4I). In stark contrast, PA-induced memory is detrimental in the context of endotoxemia, a disease driven by organ damage due to acute hyper-inflammation (Beutler et al., 1985; Mohler et al., 1993; Cunningham et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2016; Figure 4G and H).",061b56eb-e5ca-4bd8-b55e-ba969b9acf5a
80,discussion8," Furthermore, it is known that trained immunity is a key feature of Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccination, which has been shown to enhance resistance to infections, and is a possible mechanism that drives increased resistance to severe COVID-19 in the Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG)-vaccinated population . Thus, future research in understanding the plasticity of the SFA- and PA-regulated immune memory responses, enhanced pathogen clearance, and the mechanisms that drive this phenomenon, will be of interest to the larger medical community.  Mechanistically, it is appreciated that PA is not acting as a ligand for the pattern recognition receptor TLR4; however, the presence of TLR4 (independent of TLR4 signaling capability) is required for PA-dependent inflammation . Our data and others contribute to the growing evidence that PA is inducing cell intrinsic stress through alterations in metabolism.",539b9720-aba3-4a38-a453-00cbc973e4e0
81,discussion9," The crosstalk between glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, and epigenetics, is crucial for trained immunity in human monocytes, and metabolic intermediates of the TCA cycle directly modify histone methylation patterns associated with proinflammatory cytokines upregulated in trained immunity (Saeed et al., 2014; Arts et al., 2016; Ryan and O’Neill, 2020). While ceramides are known to modify histone acetylation and DNA methylation patterns , the interplay between ceramide metabolism and epigenetics within innate immune cells has not been explored. Though we have shown that PA-dependent ceramide production leads to innate immune memory, the impact of these alterations on the epigenome remains unknown. Therefore, the influence of ceramide metabolism on epigenetics will be important to consider in future trained immunity studies where PA serves as the primary stimulus.",fdc9ca9a-c5e4-48d5-a272-6c34e6957bde
82,discussion10,"  Interestingly, we find here that immunoparalysis, which is associated with a prolonged septic response and is enhanced in patients with poorer outcomes, is greater in mice-fed diets enriched in SFAs (Figure 1; Gogos et al., 2000; van Dissel et al., 1998). However, we found that this SFA-dependent enhanced immunoparalysis is abrogated in GF mice, suggesting, for the first time, that the microbial species within the SFA-fed mice may be regulating the late immunoparalytic phase of endotoxin shock. Considering the clinical correlation of immunoparalysis and increased sepsis mortality, it will be imperative to explore the identity of the SFA-dependent microbiome and the host/microbe mechanisms that drive sepsis-associated immunoparalysis.",868677f3-9514-433f-95ac-9dbad67b93d2
83,discussion11,"  Importantly, previous seminal studies concluded that mice treated with antibodies to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor and challenged with systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased survival from 0% to nearly 100%, suggesting that acute inflammation driven by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is responsible for endotoxemia-related mortality . Furthermore, it has been shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is required for acute renal failure , lung injury , and liver damage  during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. These data show that acute inflammation, specifically the bioactivity of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), drives endotoxemia mortality and organ damage in conventional mice. It has also been shown that acute inflammation, specifically tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production, is a driver of endotoxemia in GF mice .",d4ba49cb-d802-4bed-a9a2-a1dc8a371132
84,discussion12," Thus, although our conventional mice show increased immunoparalysis, we suggest that early acute systemic inflammation is the driver of disease severity and mortality in both our conventional and GF endotoxemia mouse models; however, the data we present here is not sufficient to make this conclusion.  In conclusion, this unappreciated role of dietary SFAs, specifically PA, may provide insight into the long-lasting immune reprogramming associated with a high-SFA fed population, and lends insight into the complexity of nutritional immunoregulation. Considering the results in this study, we suggest the potential for SFAs such as PA to directly impact innate immune metabolism and epigenetics associated with inflammatory pathways. Thus, our findings are paramount not only for potential dietary interventions, but also treatment of inflammatory diseases exacerbated by metabolic dysfunction in humans.
