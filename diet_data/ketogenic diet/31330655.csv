0,methods0,"4.1. Cell Culture 3T3-L1 MBX murine fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; D6546, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), plus 10% FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (P/S) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). The cells were grown in 10 cm culture dishes at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. According to ATCC recommendations, the cells were strictly subcultured before they reached a density of 6 × 106 viable cells/cm2. For differentiation into adipocytes, 3T3-L1 MBX fibroblasts were cultured to full confluency, followed by medium change with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, no. S 0615, Biochrom, Cambridge, UK), 1% P/S, 0.5 mM of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (isobutyl 1 methylxanthine (IBMX)), 0.25 μM of dexamethasone, 2 μM of rosiglitazone, and 1 μg/mL of insulin. After 48 h, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% P/S, and 1 μg/mL of insulin for 48 h.",69d9d147-45e2-4e65-a692-33f9daf44aa2
1,methods1," On day 7, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% P/S. This medium was refreshed on days 8, 10, 12, and 13. For the treatments, the cells were either incubated with water (for control) or βHB at 5 mM (54965, Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h following the completion of the differentiation protocol. We elected to use 5 mM of βHB because this is both a level readily achievable in humans through diet and fasting [2] and one we have used previously [3].  4.2. Animals All the animal procedures were approved (18-0101, approved 1-26-2018) by the institutional animal care and use committee at Brigham Young University. Twenty-week-old male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were housed for 1 week after arrival at the animal facility and were then provided with either a standard diet (SD; Envigo Teklad Rodent Diet, 8604; 32% protein, 14% fat, 54% carbohydrate) or a ketogenic diet (KD; Envigo Teklad custom diet; 22.4% protein, 77.1% fat (89% lard, 11% soybean oil), 0.",f70d5367-674b-485e-9f56-423a3d5f058d
2,methods2,"5% carbohydrate) for 4 weeks. We elected to use lard as the primary fat over Crisco or soybean oil in light of evidence suggesting lard-based diets elicit better health in rodents [4]. Each day, the chow remaining in the cage was weighed and replaced with fresh chow. Body weight for the mice was recorded weekly. At 4 weeks, the rodents were euthanized, and blood and tissues were harvested. The plasma ketone levels were measured from a warmed tail vein using a Precision Xtra Ketone Monitor (Abbott, Columbus, OH, USA). Adipose not immediately used for respiratory analysis was snap frozen and stored at −80 °C for later analysis.  4.3. Mitochondrial Respiration The cells and tissue were prepared for mitochondrial respiration, as described previously [5,14], before being transferred to respirometer chambers using the Oroboros O2K oxygraph (Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria). Briefly, the cells were resuspended in MiR05 buffer (0.",d4affb24-9b73-4b7e-a869-7010acf5ef53
3,methods3,"5 m ethylene glycol-bis-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA)), 10 mM of KH2PO4, 3 mM of MgCl2·6H2O, 60 mM of K-lactobionate, 20 mM of Hepes, 110 mM of sucrose, and 1 mg/mL of fatty-acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA; pH 7.1)) plus 1 mg/mL of digitonin and gently rocked at 37 °C for 5 min before transfer into respiration chambers. For adipose tissue, the samples were immediately placed in ice-cold buffer X (60 mM of K-Mes, 35 mM of KCl, 7.23 mM of K2-EGTA, 2.77 mM of CaK2-EGTA, 20 mM of imidazole, 20 mM of tuarine, 5.7 mM of ATP, 15 mM of PCr (phosphocreatine), and 6.56 mM of MgCl2·6H2O (pH 7.1)), and the connective tissue was removed. Following a 30 min incubation with 50 μg/mL of saponin and being rocked at 4 °C, the tissues were transferred to respiration chambers in MiR05. The electron flow through complex I was supported by glutamate + malate (10 mM and 2 mM, respectively; GM). Following stabilization, adenosine diphosphate (ADP; D) (2.",8bbf5f01-bd90-492b-a2d5-dfd6ea4efe49
4,methods4,"5 mM) was added to determine the oxidative phosphorylation capacity. Succinate was added (S) for the complex I + II electron flow into the Q-junction. Preliminary assays tested the effect of carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP; 0.05 μM) to test the full electron transport capacity, but this revealed no additive effect (data not shown). Cytochrome c (10 μM) was used to confirm the mitochondrial membrane integrity within each assay (data not shown). Basal respiration was determined through the addition of antimycin A (2.5 μM). The respiratory control ratio (respiratory control ratio (RCR)) was measured by the ratio of D:GM. Following the respiration protocol, the samples were removed from the chambers and used for further analysis, including ATP quantification. The ratio of ATP produced to peak oxygen consumed was used as an indicator of the coupling of oxygen transport to oxidative phosphorylation.",aaf96712-29dd-4931-ba12-f0f3bbcf1089
5,methods5," The cell and tissue homogenates were analyzed for protein concentration using a modified Lowry assay (DC Protein Assay; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.   4.4. Tissue Homogenization Adipose samples were homogenized in ground-glass with lysis buffer (50 mM of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 250 mM of mannitol; 50 mM of NaF; 5 mM of sodium pyrophosphate; 1 mM of EDTA; 1 mM of EGTA; 1% Triton X-100; 50 mM of β-glycerophosphate; 1 mM of sodium orthovanadate; 1 mM of DTT; 1 mM of benzamidine; 0.1 mM of phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride; 5 μg/mL of trypsin inhibitor), followed by centrifugation at 10,000× g for 10 min.   4.5. ATP Measurements  4.5.1. Cell Culture Following the PBS wash, the cells were trypsinized, pelleted, then lysed with 150 μL of 1 M perchloric acid on ice to precipitate cellular proteins. Following centrifugation at 20,000× g for 10 min, 150 μL of supernatant was transferred to a new tube with 150 μL of 1 M KOH.",279c74d8-1770-41f5-a716-da41b93ce2dc
6,methods6," The ATP was measured with an ATP assay kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).   4.5.2. Tissue Samples Rodent and human tissues were homogenized in 1 mL of lysis buffer using a glass pestle and mortar. For rodent tissue, the ATP was quantified following the snap freezing of fresh tissue. For human tissue, the ATP was quantified from tissue following the respiration protocol outlined above. Post-homogenization, 450 μL of each sample was aliquoted into a 96-well dish. ATP was measured with an ATP assay kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).  4.6. RT-qPCR The total RNA was isolated from tissue samples using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and measured on a NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The mRNA in 2 μg of total RNA was converted to cDNA using oligo(dT) primer and random hexamers according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech EcoDry Premix).",59f29994-e849-4fbd-bdfb-cffd48dca329
7,methods7," The potential primers and probes were analyzed for the requirements imposed by real-time PCR using the PrimerQuest program. Finally, the chosen primers and probes were analyzed for specificity against GenBank sequences with the BLAST program package [39]. For thermal cycling and fluorescence detection, a LightCycler 480 machine was used. The threshold (Ct) values of fluorescence for each readout were normalized to the corresponding Ct values [40], and the fold change was calculated using the ΔΔCt method [41].  4.7. Human Diet Approval for human adipose biopsies was obtained by the Institutional Review Board at Brigham Young University (E-18334; approved 4-13-18). Female and male subjects were recruited based upon long-term self-adherence to either a ketogenic (KD; n = 5, 1 female, 4 male; age: 29.2 ± SEM 3.6; βHB: 1.8 ± 0.3 mmol/L; BMI: 25.5 ± 2.6 kg/m2) or standard American diet (SD; n = 4, 1 female, 3 male; age: 21.8 ± 0.5; βHB: 0.3 ± 0.1; BMI: 24.7 ± 0.6 kg/m2).",fd26e8f8-fd6f-45e0-99d7-7059e050de52
8,methods8," Ketosis was confirmed by measuring the plasma ketones (Precision Xtra, Abbot, Columbus, OH, USA).   4.8. Human Fat Biopsies Percutaneous needle biopsies were taken from subcutaneous fat tissue near the navel. To perform the biopsy, a small area on the skin near the navel was shaved with an electric razor (when needed) and then cleaned with the antiseptic chlorhexidine. After sterilizing the area, the injection of a local anesthesia (1% lidocaine with epinephrine) was used for numbing. Upon the subject reporting no sensation in the area in response to gentle probing, a small incision (~1 cm) was made into the skin. Following this, the biopsy needle was inserted into the fat about 3 cm at a shallow (~30 degree) angle into the fat. Using manual suction, approximately 75 mg (about the size of a pencil eraser) of fat tissue was withdrawn. The sample was immediately placed in a cell buffer solution for the analysis of mitochondrial respiration.   4.9.",2feea2da-44dc-45b7-8285-a43f98740b94

The data were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.  5. Conclusions In conclusion, these results indicate that ketones elicit a pronounced and perhaps even meaningful shift in mitochondrial function in adipose tissue. Whereas adipose tissue is generally a low metabolic rate organ that stores energy, ketones enable a fundamental and uncharacteristic shift towards energy wasting via the initiation of a futile cycle by increasing electron transport but not ATP synthesis. These findings shed light on previous observations of enhanced energy expenditure in ketogenic states, and may provide novel interventions in the future to help combat the growing trend of obesity and derivative disorders.
