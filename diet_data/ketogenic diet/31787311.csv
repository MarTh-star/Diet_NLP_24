0,methods0,"2.1. Participants Children with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) were enrolled in this single-center, prospective, cohort study to receive a ketogenic diet from January 2018 to January 2019. The study was supervised by the Committee of Institutional Review Board at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (IRB no.201700968A3). Informed consent was obtained from all guardians on enrollment.  drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) was defined as failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately used antiepileptic drug (antiepileptic drug (AED)) schedules (either as monotherapy or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom [18]. Children with a confirmed diagnosis of inborn error of metabolism (pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, primary carnitine deficiency, fatty acid oxidation deficiency, ketolysis deficiency, familial hypercholesterolemia) and those who were surgical candidates were excluded.  2.2.",3eb1000a-26be-48b1-86f8-95b4bb3d3c39
1,methods1," Study Protocol All enrolled patients were admitted to a pediatric general ward at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital to receive a 5-day diet program. All study subjects underwent metabolic screening, including blood ammonia and lactate levels, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, urinary organic acids, and blood spot tests for amino acid profiles to exclude medical conditions that were inappropriate for ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). All subjects were screened for a family history of porphyria during the initial visit. Classic ketogenic diet (cKD) was initiated in each patient with GRAD-KD protocol during the 5-day hospitalization. A registered dietitian calculated the energy requirement based on daily activity, dietary history, age, body weight and height.",9ab27e63-1b73-448b-9f84-6c82473a1af7
2,methods2," During the 5-day admission, patients received one-ninth of Recommended Dietary Allowance (Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)) calories as KD prescription on day 1, one-sixth of Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) calories on day 2, one-third of Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) calories on day 3, two-thirds of Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) calories on day 4, and the full Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) calories on day 5. The keto ratio started at 2:1 on day 1 and gradually increased to 3~4: 1 on day 5, which approached 85% fat, 12% protein and 3% carbohydrate. The daily protein intake, predominantly animal protein, was in the range of 1.5–2.5 g/kg/day. Medium chain triglyceride powder was prescribed gradually at a minimum dosage of 40 g/day if patients can tolerate it. Blood sugar and βHB levels were monitored every 2–4 h during the hospitalization period to avoid hypoglycemia and hyperketosis.",bd1ec6e0-dcac-4834-bb2e-fa37cd23c5ab
3,methods3," The blood βHB level was obtained from a fingertip blood sample (Free Style Optium Neo Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System; Abbott Diabetes Care Inc., Whitney, UK) taken on the 2nd day of the 5-day diet program. On the day of discharge, the ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) nursery team educated the families on how to measure the urinary ketone level using a dipstick (Ketostix®, Bayer Diabetes, Berkshire, UK). Seizure frequency and βHB level were recorded by seizure diaries at monthly follow-up visits for 12 months.  2.3. Determination of Response to ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) The response to ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) was estimated in 28-day epochs for 12 months. Monthly seizure frequencies were calculated from seizure diaries. The formula used to calculate seizure reduction rate was [(a–b)/a] × 100 where “a” is the number of seizures in the 28-day baseline period and “b” is the number of seizures in the 28 days before the 12-month follow-up visit [9].",ed91a242-3615-4882-9300-0d3ab5ea8953
4,methods4," Patients with a reduction in seizure frequency of ≥50% were defined as responders, and those with a reduction of <50% were defined as non-responders.  2.4. Tandem Mass Spectrometry Blood samples were taken after 10 h of fasting at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months for measurement of fatty acids and amino acids by tandem mass spectrometry. The samples were prepared by removing the entire dried blood sample using a standard 0.3-cm single-hole punch into a 1-mL 96-well plate (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA; catalog number WAT058957). A 200-µL working standard (1:490 diluted in methanol; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Tewksbury, MA, USA; catalog numbers NSK-A and NSK-B) was placed in the 96-well plate. The plate incubated on a microplate shaker (Taitec, Tokyo, Japan) at a speed of 400–450 rpm. The supernatant was transferred to a Nunc plate (catalog number 249,944; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and dried using a TurboVap (Caliper life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA, USA) at 70 °C.",a83359cc-494b-4883-85f8-8a214d628831
5,methods5," Samples were reconstituted using 60 μL of 80% deionized water in acetonitrile, mixed using the Wellmix on high speed for 1 min. The mass analysis was performed using a Micromass Quattro Ultima Pt mass spectrometer (Waters 2795). Analyte-specific mass spectrometry parameters were optimized for the highest signal intensity. The data were analyzed using Masslynx 4.0 version software (Waters).  2.5. Statistical Analysis The data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean. Demographic parameters were examined by Fisher’s exact test. Biochemical parameters, including βHB and plasma acylcarnitines [19] and amino acid levels were compared in and between groups at the various time points by conducting generalized estimating equation (generalized estimating equation (GEE)) after adjusting confounding effect of anticonvulsants. Associations between βHB levels, free carnitine levels, and seizure outcomes were analyzed by the Spearman zero order correlation coefficient.",c88d9a1c-f2e9-4b79-94d0-fc15cc879c35
6,methods6," Receiver-operating characteristic (Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)) curve analysis was used to identify metabolites that are associated with the effectiveness of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). The area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)) values were determined using the receiver-operating characteristic Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The 95% confidence interval of area under curve (area under the curve (AUC)) was produced by using the pReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) [19] package in R (version 3.5.2; R Project for Statistical Computing, https://www.r-project.org). All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows version 19.0 software (IBM Corp.). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  3. Results 3.1. Clinical Characteristics Seven of the 29 patients who met the diagnostic criteria for drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) did not complete the 12-month study.",34140ccf-2ab0-40f2-9e7d-eada520b85e7
7,methods7," These seven patients withdrew before completion of 9 months either due to diet intolerance or parent-related or child-related reasons. Twenty-two patients completed 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). The diet retention rate at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were 89.6%, 83%, 76%, and 76%, respectively (Figure 1). The clinical characteristics of the 22 patients were shown in Table S1. The mean patient age was 9.3 ± 1.98 years (range, 8 months to 19 years), and the male to female ratio was 1.8:1. Generalized seizures occurred in 36.3% (8/22) of patients, focal seizures in 41% (9/22), and infantile spasm in 23% (5/22). The leading etiology was genetic (31.8%, 7/22) followed by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (22.7%, 5/22). Five (22.7%, 5/22) of patients had a seizure reduction rate of ≤25%, four (22.7%, 4/22) had a reduction of 25–50%, nine had a reduction of 50%–90%, and four (18.2%, 4/22) had a reduction of ≥90%.",cc927833-a0b8-4d5c-aa49-ff96b6fd83a0
8,methods8," The response rate (seizure reduction rate ≥50%) to 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) was 59% (13/22), with three patients (13.6%, 3/22) becoming seizure-free.  3.2. Metabolic Changes after ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) All biochemical parameters were adjusted by generalized estimating equation (GEE) to exclude confounding effect of anticonvulsants (antiepileptic drug (AED)s). Plasma acylcarnitines, and amino acids level at different time point of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) were compared with those at baseline (Table 1).  3.3. Short-Chain Acylcarnitines after ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) Acetylcarnitine (C2), an important substrate for mitochondrial energy metabolism, was significantly higher than baseline level from 3 months to 12 months (C2, β = 7.14, p < 0.05). Propionate acyl-carnitine (C3) and methylmalonyl carnitine (C4-DC) levels were significantly lower than baseline value from 3 months to 12 months (C3, β = −0.79, p < 0.001; C4-DC, β = −0.31, p < 0.001).",4a020353-27bd-467e-998d-363cc94dd10c
9,methods9," 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine (C4:OH), derives from CoA-ester of the ketone body, D-3-hydroxybutyrate [20], was significantly higher than baseline value from 3 months to 12 months (C4:OH,β = 0.24, p < 0.001). Isovaleryl carnitine (C5) was significantly lower than baseline value from 9 months to 12 months (C5, β = −0.02, p < 0.05). 3-Hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (C5:OH) was significantly lower than baseline value from 6 months to 12 months (C5:OH, β = −0.04, p < 0.05). C3, C5, and C5:OH are degradation products of ketogenic amino acids: lysine, tryptophan, leucine and isoleucine [21].C4-DC is derived from branch-chain amino acids metabolism: leucine, isoleucine and valine which are ketogenic or glucogenic amino acids, showed a positive correlation of basal glucose level [22]. The results herein disclosed that ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) successfully led to ketogenesis by increasing CoA-ester formation from fatty acid β oxidation instead of degrading ketogenic amino acids.",5ce4fabf-e434-4d26-995b-52b35e049ce2
10,methods10," On the other hand, increasing acetylcarnitine production in our results can explain how ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) could alter mitochondrial energy metabolism.  3.4. Medium-Chain Acylcarnitines after ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) Octanoyl-(C8)/decanoyl-(C10) acyl-carnitine levels were significantly lower than baseline values at 12 months (C8/C10, β = −0.15, p < 0.005). We supposed that the C8/C10 ratio became lower after ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) may be due to highest net ketogenic effect of C8 over another medium-chain triglyceride [23] so that C8 was rapidly turn over into ketone body.  3.5. Long-Chain Acylcarnitnes after ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) C14 carnitine was significantly lower than baseline values at 6 months and at 9 months; however, it became not significantly different from baseline value at 12 months (C14, β = −0.03, p < 0.005 at 6 mons; β = −0.02, p < 0.05 at 9 months). C14:1 was transiently higher than baseline values at 3 months (C14:1, β = 0.03, p < 0.01).",eb46d3f5-5c72-4b69-874a-ec43904fb764
11,methods11," C14:2 carnitine was significantly higher than baseline values at 12 months (C14:2, β = 0.01, p < 0.05). C16 carnitine was significantly lower than baseline values from 6 months to 12 months (C16, β = −0.26, p < 0.005 at 6 months; β = −0.31, p < 0.01 at 9 months; β = −0.38, p < 0.01 at 12 months). C16:1 carnitine was significantly lower than baseline values at 6 months and 12 months (C16:1, β = −0.02, p < 0.05 at 6 months; β = −0.03, p < 0.05 at 12 months). C18 carnitine showed no significant changes after ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). Our data demonstrated that C14:1 and C14:2 carnitine levels trended upwards during the study period.  3.6. Amino Acids after ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) After 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT), there was a significant decrease in levels of ketogenic amino acids, including phenylalanine, tyrosine, and leucine/isoleucine (Phenylalanine, β = −6.63, p < 0.001; tyrosine, β = −13.79, p < 0.001; leucine/isoleucine, β = −48.35, p < 0.001).",3ba7f363-54ae-4cfc-80cb-59abb6bad9d6
12,methods12," Methionine, a substrate for biogenesis of carnitine, was significantly lower than baseline value from 3 months to 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) (Methionine, β = −5.48, p < 0.001). It shared the similar tendency of free carnitine in our study. Glycine was the unique amino acid which increased its level significantly with compared to baseline levels from starting KD to 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) (Glycine, β = 78.21, p < 0.001 at baseline; β = 91.01, p < 0.05 at 3 months; β = 74.71, p < 0.005 at 6 months; β = 49.82, p < 0.01 at 12 months). The glucogenic amino acid, valine, showed significantly lower than baseline values at 9 months and 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) (valine, β = −38.38, p < 0.05 at 9 months; β = −41.06, p < 0.05 at 12 months). In addition, proline was transiently lower than baseline at 6 months and 9 months (proline, β = −52.66, p < 0.001 at 6 months; β = −49.16, p < 0.",5c801297-70f5-471f-8ab5-ae16288659ba

Arginine was transiently lower at 6 months, whereas citrulline and homocysteine were transiently higher at 3 months (arginine, β = −0.90, p < 0.05 at 3 months; citrulline, β = 2.57, p < 0.05 at 3 months; homocysteine, β = 1.17, p < 0.05 at 3 months). However, the serum level of these three amino acids showed no significant changes compared to baseline values at 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). Our results demonstrated that the concentrations of ketogenic amino acids and some glucogenic amino acids became significantly lower after 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). In addition, glycine was found persistently higher than baseline throughout the ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) period.  3.7.",e2e54339-91f9-4a20-9ae6-67ac48990c04
14,methods14," Free Carnitine after ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) There was a significant decrease in the free carnitine level after 9 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT), and never returned to baseline level at the end of study (free carnitine, β = −5.10, p < 0.01 at 9 months; β = −4.07, p < 0.05 at 12 months). However, none of our study subjects had symptoms of hypocarnitinemia, such as muscle weakness, fatigue, or anorexia. None of our study subjects received carnitine supplement during the ketogenic diet therapy (KDT).  3.8. Differences in Metabolic Parameters between Responders and Non-Responders Demographic variables and clinical characteristics were compared between responders and non-responders at the different time points in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. There was no significant between-group difference in type of seizure, etiology of epilepsy, body weight, and numbers of antiepileptic drug (AED)s administered.",8eaab169-b23f-42be-adb2-f00284baa59f
15,methods15," Non-responders received more valproic acid (valproic acid (VPA)) as monotherapy or adjuvant therapy than responders did (6 vs. 2, p < 0.05).  We offered a comparison of acylcarnitines and amino acids level between responders and non-responders as shown in Table 2. All the comparisons were examined by conducting generalized estimating equation (GEE) after adjusting the confounding effect of anticonvulsants. The results were demonstrated in Table 2 and were summarized as following paragraphs.  3.9. Free Carnitine and βHB Levels in Responders There was a significant increase in the βHB level in responders at 6 months (βHB, β = 1.43, p < 0.05 at 6 months). Free carnitine level in responders was significantly lower than that in non-responders after initiating of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) (Free carnitine, β = −7.85, p < 0.05 at baseline; β = −11.84, p < 0.005 at 3 months; β = −15.94, p < 0.001 at 9 months; β = −6.77, p < 0.05 at 9 months; β = −8.59, p < 0.01 at 12 months).",77d10111-b569-4839-9841-60a92d09a3c2
16,methods16," Free carnitine levels reached a nadir in responders at 6 months (Supplementary Table S3, responders vs. non-responders, 20.84 ± 6.89 vs. 29.03 ± 8.86, p < 0.05), approaching the diagnostic criteria of carnitine deficiency defined as carnitine level ≤20 µM or a ratio of acylated-to-free carnitine of ≥0.4, at an age over 1 week post term [24], and gradually increased its level thereafter. There was a negative correlation between βHB and free carnitine levels (Supplementary Figure S1A, ρ = −0.686, p < 0.05). Carnitine is a crucial factor in the transfer of fatty acids for mitochondrial β-oxidation, and βHB is the major product of ketosis, we examined the βHB and free carnitine levels at 6 months to assess the association with efficacy of diet (≥50% seizure reduction).",791b83c4-d475-4d1d-a40a-18185f43cb40

Short-Chain Acylcarnitines in Responders There was a decrease in C2 in responders at baseline and at 3 months, however the C2 levels became comparable between groups after 3 months (C2, β = −8.95, p < 0.005 at baseline; β = −9.67, p < 0.05). C3 levels in responders were significantly lower after initiating of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) to the end of study (C3, β = −1.28, p < 0.05 at baseline; β = −1.68, p < 0.001 at 3 months; β = −1.8, p < 0.001 at 6 months; β = −1.12, p < 0.05 at 9 months; β = −0.98, p < 0.05 at 12 months).",9040e9ca-ac50-46d3-8038-d44ca06554c2
18,methods18," C4:OH levels were significantly lower in responders than in non-responders at baseline, but the level became comparable between groups after initiating of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) (C4:OH, β = −0.07, p < 0.05). C4-DC levels in responders were transiently and significantly lower at 3 months, and the levels became comparable between groups from 3 months to 12 month (C4-DC, β = −0.06, p < 0.05 at 3 months). C5 levels in responders were significantly lower than that in non-responders from 3 to 12 months (C5, β = −0.09, p < 0.001 at 3 months; β = −0.10, p < 0.001 at 6 months; β = −0.07, p < 0.005 at 9 months; β = −0.04, p < 0.005 at 12 months). C5:1 level was fluctuating in responders. C5:1 levels were significantly lower in responders at 3 months and 9 months, but they showed no significant differences between groups at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months (C5:1, β = −0.01, p < 0.05 at 3 months; β = −0.01, p < 0.05 at 9 months).",716a0131-0e8d-4857-a3d4-a99e36b822f0

Our data demonstrated that C3 and C5 carnitines had persistently lower levels in responders than in non-responders after initiating of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT).  3.11. Medium-Chain Acylcarnitines in Responders We found C6 levels were significantly lower in responders at 6 months and 9 months, but there were no between-group differences at other time point (C6, β = −0.02, p < 0.001 at 6 months; β = −0.02, p < 0.05 at 9 months).

C12 levels were significantly lower in responders only at 3 months, but not at other time points (C12, β = −0.07, p < 0.05). In brief summary, although medium-chain acylcarnitines showed significantly lower in responders at some time points of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT); however, none of them showed significant differences between responders and non-responders at endpoint of the study.  3.12. Long-Chain Acylcarnitines in Responders C14 levels in responders were also significantly lower than that in non-responders at baseline, 6 months and 9 months (C14, β = −0.04, p < 0.05 at baseline; β = −0.04, p < 0.01 at 6 months; β = −0.04, p < 0.05 at 9 months).",5e2425ca-c2f2-433b-bdf5-6a01371cad6d

However, C18 levels showed no significant between-group differences at the endpoint of study. Our data disclosed that although blood levels of some long-chain acylcarnitines were significantly lower in responders at some time points of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT); however, just palmitoyl carnitine (C16) levels were found significantly lower in responders at the endpoint of study.  3.13. Amino Acids in Responders The comparison of amino acids between responders and non-responders was demonstrated in Table 3. Phenylalanine decreased in responders, reaching nadir levels at 6 months, and was significantly lower than in non-responders at 6 months and 9 months, but it tended to increase thereafter, although not to the baseline values by the end of the study (Phenylalanine, β = −11.97, p < 0.",19724ce0-3a8e-4a14-83e6-353f4ab7af45

23,methods24," Valine levels were significantly lower in responders at 9 months, but not at other time points (valine, β = −21.57, p < 0.05 at 9 months). Ornithine levels were significantly higher in responders at baseline (ornithine, β= 9.72, p < 0.05 at baseline), but it got paradoxically lower than that in non-responders at 3 months and 6 months (β = −7.56, p < 0.01 at 3 months; β = −5.79, p < 0.05 at 6 months). Amino acids, including tyrosine, proline, methionine, glutamic acid, citrulline, and homocysteine showed no significant between-group differences at different time points of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). Our results demonstrated that leucine/isoleucine levels, the ketogenic amino acids, in responders were significantly lower at the endpoint of study, which may indicate that degrading ketogenic amino acids into acetyl-CoA significantly decreased in responders at 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT).",696b0ed5-ed5b-480c-8bd2-436ec4313474
24,methods25," Although phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio was significantly higher in responders at 12 months, the mean phenylalanine level in responders never reached ≥400 umol/l and the ratio never reached ≥1.5 at 12 months (mean phenylalanine level: 39.33 ± 6.85 umoL/L; mean ratio 1.14 ± 0.24). The relative high phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio in responders was presumptive no clinical significance.  3.14. Predictors and Associated Factors of KD Effectiveness Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to identify metabolic parameters that could predict the efficacy of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) at baseline. The area under the curve (AUC)s for C14, C3, and C18 were between 0.79–0.85 when comparing these metabolites at baseline between responders and non-responders (Figure 2A, C14 carnitine, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.846, p < 0.01; C3 carnitine, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.835, p < 0.005; C18 carnitine, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.791, p < 0.",4e666916-01d3-4f19-ac45-00b59440ce5c

This result indicated that a lower baseline C14 level had the highest predictive ability of KD effectiveness.  After 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT), there was a significant decrease in leucine/isoleucine, C16-and C5 carnitines at 12 months as shown in Table 2 and Table 3. The area under the curve (AUC)s for leucine/isoleucine, C16-and C5 carnitines were between 0.7 and 0.9 when comparing responders and non-responders (Figure 2B, leucine/isoleucine, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.856, p < 0.001; C16 carnitine, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.800, p < 0.05; C5 carnitine, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.756, p < 0.05), indicating strong association with ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) effectiveness at 12 months. Leucine-isoleucine had the highest area under the curve (AUC) value, followed by C16 carnitine, and then C5 carnitine.  4.",45d1b626-6b32-4be1-ba16-e0979b765c0f
26,methods27," Discussion Our results provide evidence that C2 carnitine level significantly increased throughout the diet therapy; otherwise, the long-chain acylcarnitines, C16 and C16:1 levels were significantly decreased after 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). Study subjects had significant lower carnitine levels than baseline values after 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT), though carnitine level gradually elevated toward baseline level eventually. It is known that the brain utilizes ketone bodies, especially βHB, derived from acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and acetoacetyl-coenzyme A (acetoacetyl-CoA) produced by β-oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria of the liver [25]. Long-chain fatty acids (>12 carbons) from ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) undergo thio-esterification to CoA and are catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthases (acyl CoA synthases (ACS)) to form acyl-CoA [26].",8d4c8fff-9727-46b2-a8dd-7b94f0835e7c
27,methods28," Acyl-CoA must be conjugated to carnitine with formation of acyl-carnitines through the action of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPTI)), so that it can penetrate mitochondrial membrane. Acyl-carnitines are translocated across the inner mitochondrial membrane by acyl-carnitine translocase (CACT). Carnitine is removed from acyl-carnitine inside the mitochondrion by carnitine palmitoyl transferase II (carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPTI)I), and acyl-CoAs and acetylcarnitine (C2 carnitine) are generated. Acyl-CoAs can enter β-oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix, finally producing acetyl-CoA, which leads to production of ketone bodies or to entry of citric acid cycle (Figure 3). The higher the efficiency of mitochondrial β-oxidation or energy metabolism in the liver, the more C2 carnitine is formed from free carnitine, leading to less acumination of long-chain fatty acid and a drop in plasma free carnitine.",f1f652dc-0c9c-4ecd-97b7-caa8bdca95a6
28,methods29," Thus, the decrement of C16 carnitine and the increment of C2 carnitine in our result may indicate improvement of mitochondrial functioning and energy metabolism after KD. The clinical practice with regard to carnitine supplement for a drop in free carnitine has huge diversity. We followed the recommendations given by KD expert consensus not routinely supplying carnitine for children with ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) unless they showed biochemical or symptomatic deficiency.  C3-, C5-, C5:OH-, and C4-DC carnitine, derives from ketogenic amino acids, were significantly lower than baseline levels, while C4:OH, derived from CoA-ester of the ketone bodies, was significantly higher than baseline values after 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). Since a ketogenic diet provides 80–90% of calories as lipid, ketogenesis is characterized by a decrease in a protein breakdown and an increase in fat and ketone use [27].",1e30c5f4-18b8-46bc-a4c7-d4fed227eb77
29,methods30," It can provide explanation of opposite alteration of ketogenic amino acids (e.g., C3-C5-C5:OH and C4-DC) and C4:OH, the derives of ketone body.  We disclosed C8 and C8/C10 ratio became significantly lower after 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). C8/C10 ratio is one of the most commonly reported markers in screening for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD)) [28]. However, none of our study subjects conformed diagnosis of medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD). Previous report revealed that C8 has the highest net ketogenic effect compared with other tested oils containing medium-chain triglyceride [23]. We presumed that C8 levels and C8/C10 ratio became lower after ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) may be due to rapidly turnover of C8 into ketone bodies. Both C14:1 and C14:2 carnitine levels trended upwards during study period.",74579747-e5e4-4013-911a-f259f10d4c1b
30,methods31," Elevated C14:1 and C14:2 plasma acylcarnitine after a controlled fast is a diagnostic strategy for very long-chain acyl-coA dehydrogenase (very long chain acyl coA dehydrogenase (VLCAD)) deficiency. However, the elevation of C14:1 and C14:2 plasma acylcarnitines in the setting of prolonged fast and hypoglycemia with induction of lipolysis and generating ketone response is physiologic and not indicative of a diagnosis of very long chain acyl coA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency [29,30]. Since ketogenic diet is a high fat and low carbohydrate diet which mimics starvation by generating ketone bodies, the elevation of C14:1 and C14:2 may reflect lipolysis getting progressively increasing as ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) keeping on going.  ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) affects not only lipids but also amino acids.",b8fe3fb1-b60d-49dd-b41a-c38ed0c5ec74
31,methods32," There have been several reports on changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amino acids under ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) [31,32]; however, literature is limited on changes in serum amino acid levels in response to ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). Millichap found that the only change in serum under ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) was an increased leucine level [15,33]. Levels of several amino acids, including phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine/isoleucine, and methionine, were also significantly lower after 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). Glycine is the only amino acid showing persistently high through study period in our study. Phenylalanine and tyrosine are the substrates of norepinephrine, which is considered one of the mechanisms of the anticonvulsant effect of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) [34,35,36].",894b0791-7adc-4c9c-a599-b5cc15acbf1d
32,methods33," Consuming phenylalanine and tyrosine to form norepinephrine is presumed to be the possible explanation for their lower levels in our result, and this suggests that norepinephrine is one of the mechanisms of anticonvulsant effect. In addition, methionine is a substrate for biogenesis of carnitine, consumption of carnitine to form acyl-carnitine would lead to consumption of methionine, which explains the decrease in the methionine level [10,37]. Although there are reports of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) being an effective treatment for refractory epilepsy in patients with non-ketotic hyperglycemia [38,39], we suggested that ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) should be avoided in these patients, given the persistently high glycine level based on our results.  We furthermore explored the association between metabolic parameters and the response to ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). Schoeler et al. [9] reported that C2 carnitine at baseline was significantly higher in responders.",7e9665b1-9fe0-4671-b592-e0cd99488c87
33,methods34," However, in our data, responders had significantly lower C2 level at baseline, but its concentration became higher than non-responders after 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). The result was not consistent with the previous report, which demonstrated baseline C2 carnitine is positively associated with greater efficacy of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) [9]. The most probable explanation for the contradictory results is presumed to be that patients in this study received non-fasting ketogenic diet therapy (KDT), and the production of acetyl-carnitine to form ketones slowly progressed with time but not in a short time.  Additionally, our data disclosed that C3, C14, C18 at baseline, while C3, C5, C16, and leucine-isoleucine at 12 months are negatively associated with greater efficacy of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). Branch-chain amino acids (Branch chain amino acids (BACC)), such as leucine isoleucine and valine are metabolic fuels that can generate C3- and C5 acylcarnitines.",7dcfd9fe-b98e-41b4-938a-ceb3075780a3
34,methods35," C5 acylcarnitines are comprised of α-methylbutyryl and isovalerylcarnitine species, intermediates in mitochondrial isoleucine and leucine catabolism. C3-acylcarnitine reflects the propionyl CoA pool, which is a byproduct of both isoleucine and valine catabolism in the mitochondria. It was reported that accumulation of C3-and C5-acylcarnitines could contribute to incomplete oxidation of fatty acids. Responders and non-responders were different in long-, C3 and C5 acylcarnitine indicating they may be distinct in the aspect of mitochondrial functioning. We have more non-responders receiving valproic acid (VPA) during study period. The relatively higher long-chain fatty acid, C14, C16, C16:1, C18, C3, and C5 found in non-responders might result from the treatment with valproic acid (VPA). valproic acid (VPA) is a fatty acid analog and a substrate for the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway.",6faf623b-e330-4bb6-af91-67d580ff2ba1
35,methods36," valproic acid (VPA) combines with CoA or carnitine to form valproyl-CoA and then leads to direct competitive inhibition of carnitine uptake at the transporter site by reducing the availability of free CoA. Mitochondrial depletion of free CoA impairs β-oxidation of fatty acids and impairs subsequent transport of long-chain fatty acids [40]. Some studies have shown that valproic acid (VPA) induces accumulation of long-chain fatty acids (C10–16) in cultured fibroblasts [41] or in humans (C12, C14:1, C16;1, C18:1) [42]. Our results suggested that accumulation of long-chain fatty acids, C3 and C5 acylcarnitine is an indicator of impaired fatty acid β-oxidation. Responders with lower level of long-chain fatty acid and C3 at initiation and long-term management of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) are assumed to have a better mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway, which also acted as associated factors for greater effectiveness of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) in our study.",cf6dc003-734e-410d-abac-f9443d690e85
36,methods37,"  Responders in this study demonstrated hypocarnitinemia throughout the study. Factors believed to increase the risk of hypocarnitinemia in patients with epilepsy include young age, use of multiple antiepileptic drug (AED)s, and poor nutritional status [43,44,45]. Although our data indicated a positive correlation between body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and the free carnitine level (Supplementary Figure S2); however, the tendency of free carnitine and body mass index (BMI) was not similar in this study. Free carnitine level decreased gradually, reaching a nadir at 6 months of therapy, whereas body mass index (BMI) in responders gradually decreased between 9 and 12 months. This finding suggests that hypocarnitinemia in responders cannot be attributed to low body mass index (BMI). Researchers have found carnitine deficiency in 4–76% of patients receiving valproic acid (VPA) [46,47,48].",49e5a42f-f793-475d-afcd-ff20fdc010dd
37,methods38," Although more non-responders than responders received valproic acid (VPA) as monotherapy or add-on treatment in our study, hypocarnitinemia only occurred in responders. Therefore, treatment with valproic acid (VPA) could not be a reason for hypocarnitinemia in patients on ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) in this study. There is another biochemical reason that can explain ketogenic diet therapy (KDT)-related hypocarnitinemia. We presumed that responders possessed a better functioning mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway, resulting in consuming plasma free carnitine, which provided the best explanation of hypocarnitinemia in responders.  Like previous researches on ketogenic diet therapy (KDT), this study has some limitations, including a small sample size, lack of blinding or randomization, lack of a control group, and lack of age stratification.",65504392-7956-4d72-b5a1-e9f5f550d4a0
38,methods39," The human metabolome is influenced by a number of endogenous factors, such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) [49,50,51,52], so that age stratification is mandatory if we can extend the study numbers. Blinding is difficult in ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) research for obvious reasons. The effectiveness of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) in patients with refractory epilepsy is well documented, so it would be ethically to randomize patients to study groups. Patients with refractory epilepsy account for only 30% of all cases of pediatric epilepsy, so it is inevitable that those receiving ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) are a small population. Finally, given the small sample size, we could not stratify our patients by age.  5.",0491cfc3-23f1-4752-bc1c-af8232ec3654
39,methods40," Conclusions The novel finding of this study is that C3-, C5-, C5:OH-, and C4-DC decreased, and C4OH increased significantly at 12 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) indicated decreasing glucose breakdown with increasing ketosis on long-term ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). We also suggested that ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) should be avoided in patients with non-ketotic hyperglycemia, given the persistently high glycine level based on our results. Transient hypocarnitinemia was found during 9 months of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) but was asymptomatic and resolved eventually, so that there is no need for carnitine supplementation. Our results also afford a new insight into the metabolic parameters that predict the response to ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). The lower C3, C14, C18 at baseline could predict the efficacy of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT), whereas lower C5, C16, and Ile/Leu level were factors associated with the effectiveness of long-term ketogenic diet therapy (KDT).",2e5442d9-9047-4413-a1d5-96ab2d2a5081
