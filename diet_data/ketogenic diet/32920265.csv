0,background0," A ketogenic diet (KD) is a nutritional approach, usually adopted for weight loss, that restricts daily carbohydrates under 30 g/day. KD showed contradictory results on sport performance, whilst no data are available on team sports. We sought to investigate the influence of a KD on different parameters in semi-professional soccer players. ",721cbcd7-a5fc-4c03-b8ff-a41bb2f6bdd9
1,methods0," Subjects were randomly assigned to a iso-protein (1.8 g/Kg body weight/day) ketogenic diet (KD) or western diet (WD) for 30 days. Body weight and body composition, resting energy expenditure (resting energy expenditure (REE)), respiratory exchange ratio (respiratory exchange ratio (RER)), cross sectional area (cross sectional area (CSA)) and isometric muscle strength of quadriceps, counter movement jump (counter movement jump (CMJ)) and yoyo intermittent recovery test time were measured.

2,analysis0," Results are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). An independent samples t test was used to test baseline differences between groups. The two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was performed, with two levels by time (pre- and post-test) and considering groups (KD, WD) as inter-subject factor, in order to assess differences between groups over the course of the study (Graphpad Prism version n 4.00 for Mac, GraphPad software, San Diego, CA, USA and JASP http://www.jasp-stats.org). All differences were considered significant at P < 0.05 (95% CI). Post-hoc analyses were performed using the Bonferroni test. In addition, effect size (ES) calculation was done with Cohen’s d, as a standardized measurement based on SD differences; while d = 0.2 was considered a small affect, d = 0.5 was medium effect and d = 0.8 was a large effect, it is used as a guide for substantive significance.

Subjects adhered very well with the given instructions for both diet interventions according to analysis of diets records (3 days food-diary before the study and 7 days food-diary during the study). During the diet interventions, as planned, carbohydrate intake was significantly lower and fat intake significantly higher in the KD. Total dietary energy intake was reduced during both diet without significant difference (KD = 1.984 ± 340Kcal/day; WD = 1.752 ± 320Kcal/day. Importantly, protein intake, calculated both as energy percentage and grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, was similar in the two groups (Table 3).",e88649ed-19f4-4f62-a737-760a62884ce4

8,discussion0," To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the effects of a KD on performance in team sport, like soccer. Although many strategies are available for athletes aiming to reduce weight, the majority of those are not without risks and are not universally effective for all athletes. In our study, a team of semi-professional soccer players underwent a significant reduction in body weight, body fat mass, waist circumference, visceral adipose tissues (visceral adipose tissue (VAT)) and extra cellular water (extracellular water (ECW)) without negative effects on strength, power and muscle mass. Our data, in contrast to other studies [16, 18], showed no deleterious effects of KD on sport performance nor an improvement [19, 21]. Substantially our data suggest no effects of a KD on soccer-related performance tests.",e1fc03e5-57b6-4801-8cd7-57b9f5800849
9,discussion1," These conflicting results could be explained by several factors: necessity to keep diet at least for 5–6 days, that is the time needed for keto-adaptation (as suggested in a recent paper [41];  electrolytes supplementation;  adequate protein intake in terms of quantity, quality and timing;  adequate hydration [12].  In our study the ketogenic phase was kept for 30 days, the duration of the diet was chosed on the bases of previous published researches [16, 18, 42–44]. As suggested by Burke and colleagues 5–6 days are enough to reach an adaptation [41] and could be defined as brief or short-term adaptation whilst 30 days could be defined as medium KD adaptation [41, 45] Adequate supplementation containing sodium and potassium in a form of plant extract, and magnesium was included. This aspect allowed to keep an healthy electrolytic balance with an adequate intake of minerals and vitamins, which is really essentials to preserve the functions of tissues [28].",3e55ae90-cb0a-47b3-80c2-8e32110df6a6
10,discussion2," It is known that micronutrients play an important role in energy production, hemoglobin synthesis, bone health, immune system and protection from oxidative stress [46]. Actually, these supplementations are not fundamental for athletes who eat an adequate quantity and good quality of foods, however, during period of low-caloric diet or unbalanced diet, such as ketogenic diet, a supplementation with minerals and vitamins may be useful to improve nutritional status and athletic performance [46]. In our study the athletes enrolled in the KD group were able to maintain their lean soft tissue. One of the reasons for this result may rely on the adequate amount of protein intake: indeed, we calculated the protein intake of the subjects according to the last evidence issued from International Society of Sport Nutrition (International Society of Sport Nutrition (ISSN)) [32].",e8c8c0ae-fecf-4251-8a32-2a74da07cf7d
11,discussion3," Protein intake was distributed equally throughout the day (every 3–4 h): KD was provided with high protein substitutive meals (ready to eat ketogenic products (RKP)), whilst WD ate high protein foods as cottage cheese, egg white, bresaola or whey protein.  Pre-sleep casein protein intake (30–40 g) was provided in both group after training evening session, as indicated by International Society of Sport Nutrition (ISSN) [32]. Moreover, considering that in sports field the prevention of loss of skeletal muscle during acute inflammation is fundamental, KD could be a tool to reduce inflammation [30, 47] and therefore preserve muscle mass [48]. Lastly, both groups were provided of an adequate intake of water, in order to avoid dehydration, a condition that has detrimental effects and lead to a great reduction in performance. The maintenance of strength and power performance deserves close attention.",f483a57c-737a-4342-a8a1-c5c1f38a6e90
12,discussion4," It has already been demonstrated that a 30-days of KD did not negatively affect explosive and strength performance in a group of high-level gymnasts [19], and, these positive result reflected the high intake of proteins, (~ 40% daily intake (130 ± 25 g x day − 1)). In this study, strength and lean soft tissue were maintained even though the daily intake of protein was lower: we provided 1.8 g x Kg− 1 x body weight− 1 (~ 25–30% protein daily intake) in both groups. The fundamental point is that an inadequate protein intake would be likely to negatively affect performance. Even with this amount of protein though, the players showed a decrease in body mass and a maintenance of muscle mass, as a result of the well-known “muscle- sparing effect”, which occurs after a few days of ketosis [12]. During ketosis, the use of KBs and FFAs for energy production reduces gluconeogenesis that is related to an increased muscle protein catabolism and therefore, preserves muscle mass.",1f437519-109b-4397-bd7f-f2ba4c46ef71
13,discussion5," Moreover, the relative increase of dietary amino-acid intake stimulates protein synthesis effect via mTOR signaling pathways [49] and it has been proposed as key factor for the preservation of lean soft tissue during KD [50] together with the anticatabolic effect in skeletal muscle given by the pleiotropic effects of ketone bodies on gene expression in muscle mass, inflammation and oxidative stress [51].. Recent studies have shown a preservation of strength in individuals on low carbohydrate diets [21, 52–54], nevertheless, dietary strategies involving carbohydrate restriction have been considered potentially able to compromise strength and power performance on longer term, as a result of diet-induced glycogen depletion [55]. The restoration of muscle glycogen by means of carbohydrate ingestion is obviously important for athletes and should not be neglected. On the other hand, KD may interfere with some muscle molecular (IGF-1, mTOR, AKT etc.",c8016140-2d18-4fd0-a414-d8d64728ff8e
14,discussion6,") [50] and hormonal mechanisms (during the ketogenic period insulin, a powerful anabolic hormone, remains at very low levels, around 7 mU/L) related to skeletal muscle hypertrophy processes. The net balance, as suggested by recent research, seems to be the maintaining of muscle mass but a blunted hypertrophy response [54]. For athletes, the nutrients intake strategy should be tailored to the functional needs of the particular sport and, perhaps even more specifically, to the particular positional requirements within a sport and the individual needs of the athlete. One of the most striking result of the study was the ability of players to maintain their level of training and performance. This is in contradiction with the results of studies showed a decreased in performance after 10 weeks [56], 3 weeks [16], or 7 days or less of carbohydrate restricted diets [57].",083027c8-9407-4043-ab25-6d7d52adcc1a
15,discussion7," This may be explained by the different subjects we investigated, indeed, for the first time, athletes of team sport were studied under a KD protocol, whilst previous studies studied mainly endurance athletes or strength/power athletes. Moreover, it should be noticed that the increasing in the Yo-Yo and counter movement jump (CMJ) in both groups from pre to post intervention, may be reasonably due to the reduction of total body mass and to the maintenance of lean soft tissue (as showed by DXA, cross sectional area (CSA) and strength) which, in turn, has improved the power/body weight ratio [19, 58]. As regard weight loss, the evidences supporting it, are certainly strong [59] and as described previously, many factors seem to be involved [60]. One suggested reason for a greater weight loss during a KD is its anorexigenic effects and hence, a reduction of daily energy intake; this was not the case of our study whereas energy intake was equivalent between the two groups.",f198d42e-a6cf-4be0-bf72-469a7d375c88
16,discussion8," Other candidate for the greater fat loss is the increase in resting energy expenditure (REE). As a matter of fact the question is still under debate: there are data suggesting that the fat loss induced by a ketogenic diet relies only on calorie deficit [61] whilst other researchers claim that KD induces an increase of resting energy expenditure (REE) [62, 63]. This metabolic advantage may occur during a KD due to the demand on protein turnover for gluconeogenesis, greater thermogenic effect of protein and loss of energy as heat, and/or excretion of energy in the form of ketones via urine, feces, and/or sweat. Notably, we reported no significant effect of time * diet interaction in resting energy expenditure (REE) (in absolute terms and weight-adjusted), after 30 days of KD. It has to be underline, however, that calculating the simple main effect for diet in KD group showed a significative result in adjusted resting energy expenditure (REE) (Pbonf < 0.001 with an ES Cohen’s d: 0.6).",12737982-7c64-44bd-8bcc-1286e2cfab10
17,discussion9," Moreover our data support the idea that an adequate intake of protein facilitates weight loss, in part, by preserving the basal metabolic rate. It is known that fat free mass is the major determinant of resting energy expenditure (REE) [64] and, in our study, it has been maintained in both groups. As previously pointed out, the body has a great capacity to adapt substrate oxidation to substrate intake after approximately 1 week of carbohydrate and fats, in our study fat oxidation increased, as an adaptation to the high-fat intake, typical of KD. respiratory exchange ratio (RER) decreased dramatically reflecting both the reduction in lipid synthesis and increased lipolysis mechanisms and an increase in fat metabolism for energy use. Considering the isocaloric diet, the same training protocols, and the absence of significative difference of resting energy expenditure (REE)’s change between groups, the measured greater fat loss in the KD deserves few more words.",9a256927-c66f-4417-9680-18ee04cf7ffa
18,discussion10," Our data confirmed previous findings from our group [36] and other groups [65] about the lack of a significant increase of resting energy expenditure (REE) during short term KD compared to a WD in training individual. However, in our study, resting energy expenditure (REE) in KD group showed a greater ES compared to WD. This little resting energy expenditure (REE) increase (1.32 Kcal/Kg bw/day; 5.47%) may explain findings from other researchers showing a significant effect of KD on resting energy expenditure (REE) and thus a greater weight loss during more long intervention studies [66]. Caloric intake showed no significant difference between the two groups (as showed in Table 4), even though the total dietary energy intake was slightly higher (although not significant) during KD (1.984 ± 340Kcal/day) compared to WD (1.752 ± 320Kcal/day).",9a087cbf-8b01-45ea-bdf4-1df8046ba7ff

20,discussion16," dry lean soft tissue (Dlean soft tissue (LST)) was calculated as lean soft tissue (LST)-total body water (TBW); lean soft tissue (LST) Hydr was calculated as total body water (TBW)/lean soft tissue (LST)  Regarding visceral adipose tissue (VAT), the majority of the published researches on KD and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were on persons with obesity [68–73], whilst only one previous study investigate the effect of KD on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in trained males [21]. Our data confirm the KD exerts a positive effect on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) not only in persons with obesity but also in athletes.  visceral adipose tissue (VAT) accumulation is associated with multiple cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) risk factors, including hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and low-grade chronic inflammation [74].",8c14970b-bb32-42bf-80a2-80c46837547e
21,discussion17," In athletes the reduction of the latest is of paramount importance to reduce injury risk and to improve recovery [75].  Some limits need to be considered. With regard to body composition’s analysis, a consideration should be done: as emerged from our study, both groups lost a significant amount of visceral fat measured by DXA, however, it has to be considered that DXA is an indirect approach with potential errors due to the fluid changes and hydration status of individuals [76]. For this reason, we checked hydration values demonstrating no significant changes in lean soft tissue (LST) hydration.  Another limit of our research is the low sample number due to the common problem of recruiting athletes playing in sport team for experimental protocol during the competitive season. To minimize the burden on subjects, tests were performed at only at 2 time points, (beginning and end of the study), thus ketonemia was measured twice a week.",ec0037da-54bf-46f0-ac97-b75f124a068e
22,discussion18," Further limit could be the absence of blood exams such as pro-inflammatory cytokines; we decided to not perform hematological exams to increase adherence of athletes and in consideration of the fact that many papers have been already published about the effects of KDs on these variables.  Finally, since adherence to KD may be hard to be maintained for long periods due to the lack of some basic foods (i.e.: pasta, rice, sweets) and extra-supplements may be not always available for athletes, a specific and more accurate protocol based on convenience foods could be potentially developed in order to facilitate adherence to the KD. Moreover, a ketogenic diet can be vegetarian or vegan, with plant-based fats (i.e.., avocado, nuts, seeds, coconut, olive oil), proteins (i.e., tofu, tempeh, seitan, pea protein, veggie bacon), nonstarchy vegetables, and limited amounts of low-sugar fruits (i.e.: berries, lime, lemon, kiwis).",567f7ee6-c852-42cb-981a-fc466c72cb46
23,discussion19," This kind of “flexibility” allows practitioners to targeting and personalizing dietary choice on a KD. A fundamental point that can be also considered is that subjects in KD received specific plant extracts in a minimum dosage to increase the daily intake of fluid, however, the dosage was very low and could not be counted as supplements able to induce some extra effects.  Conclusions  A common objective for many soccer players is to lose body fat while gaining or maintaining muscle mass, strength and power, although the time periods for such gains and losses are infrequent and often short.  There are several options available to lose fat. Regarding the well-known and discussed principle of energy balance, one option is to reduce energy intake by up 1000Kcal/day per week, but, this method may take longer to achieve weight loss goals and when energy intake is restricted, it is important to acknowledge the corresponding decrease in protein ingestion.",30d2f71e-a1c1-488b-9353-7ce5ff806ade
24,discussion20," An inadequate protein ingestion leads to negative effects on athletic performance, mood, perception of fatigue and decrease in lean soft tissue. Current protein intake guidelines for athletes suggest, for an average individual of 70 Kg of body weight, around 120 g of protein adequately distributed throughout the day [32]. In our study, we demonstrate that KD could be a safe and feasible strategy to lose fat mass in a short term, without impairing strength, power and muscle mass in a team sport like soccer.  Additionally, the greater reduction in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) during KD in athletes represents a novel significant finding that deserve further investigation in higher categories soccer athletes. When the goal is a rapid weight loss reduction, coaches and athletes should consider the use of KD as a feasible and safe tool also in team sports.
