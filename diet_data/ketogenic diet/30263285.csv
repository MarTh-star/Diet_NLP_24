10,methods10," Since subcutaneous xenograft model is the most commonly used implantation model in the study of testing the changes in gene expression of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [56,57], Hep3B (shlacZ and shHMGCS2) and Huh-7 (eGFP and HMGCS2) cells (5 × 106) were injected subcutaneously into both flanks of the NOD/SCID mice. Tumor growth was monitored three times a week by using Vernier caliper to measure of the length (L) and width (W) of the tumors. The tumor volume (TV) was calculated as follows: TV = (L × W2)/2. To alleviate and minimize potential pain, suffering, or distress in mice, when the tumor volume reached 1 cm3 in the vehicle control mice, monitoring was stopped. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taipei Medical University (LAC-2019-0186). Tumors and liver tissues were harvested at the end of the experiments.",68c53fa6-5610-4c8c-8c2c-34502786ccf3
11,methods11," The samples used in protein and RNA analyses were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 ℃, while those used for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were fixed in 10% formalin.  4.11. β-Hydroxybutyrate Treatment Hep3B and Huh-7 shHMGCS2 cells (3 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates, and after the cells were attached, medium containing 5, 10, or 20 mM βHB (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added and incubated for the indicated time periods. Hepatic ketogenesis produces only D-βHB; thus, in this study, we focused on investigating the role of D-βHB.  4.12. Gene Expression Profiling The mRNA profiles were analyzed using a Human OneArray Plus (Phalanx Biotech, Hsinchu, Taiwan). Total RNA was extracted from Huh-7 shlacZ and Huh-7 shHMGCS2 cells.

13,methods13," Conclusions Our study used a human liver disease tissue microarray, cellular experiments, and animal models to demonstrate that HMGCS2 controls the proliferation and migration abilities of liver cancer cells by regulating the apoptosis, c-Myc/cyclin D1, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathways and acts in a ketogenesis enzyme-dependent manner. Taken together, our data suggest that HMGCS2 could be considered a promising targetable biomarker in future therapeutic interventions in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.
