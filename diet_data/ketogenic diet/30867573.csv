0,methods0,"2.1 Literature search and survey development We conducted a systematic review of existing literature to determine (a) the use of Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) in r(20), (b) the use of Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) in similar complex drug‐refractory epilepsies, and (c) previous questionnaire‐based assessments of the use of Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) in epilepsy. Results informed the development of two online surveys to assess Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) use and experience in r(20) for healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients, families, and carers (PFCs), and to gather basic demographic, diagnostic, and clinical care information to benefit the current understanding of r(20). The surveys were qualitative in nature with descriptive comments encouraged; patient and expert collaborators assessed content, accuracy, and readability prior to distribution.  2.",eeeeb74f-08c8-4bcd-adf4-54a525e4285c
1,methods1,"2 Survey distribution and analysis Surveys were advertized through social media and epilepsy and Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) charities. The HCP survey was additionally cascaded through EpiCARE (European Reference Network for rare and complex epilepsies), KDRD, KetoPag, and UK hospitals advertising specialist support for complex epilepsies. To understand real or perceived challenges and barriers to Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), responses were sought from anyone with experience in r(20) regardless of familiarity or use of Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT). Surveys were accessed via SurveyMonkey, open from March 11 to April 28 2019. Responses were collated and summarized.  2.3 Workshop Expressions of interest for workshop attendance were sought through the Ring20 Charity patient and family, and healthcare professional networks. All interested members were welcome to attend; travel and accommodation costs were reimbursed.",352e5972-f257-4335-9a47-65c5b5c1b513
2,methods2," The workshop was hosted in London, May 2019; Figure 1 outlines the program. Attendees included Ring20 Charity co‐founders, two Patient Led Research Hub (PLRH) members, two r(20) patients, six family members and carers, two pediatric neurologists, pediatric dietitian specializing in Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), and Mathew's Friends founder.

3,results0,"All survey data reported were supported anecdotally by workshop attendees.  3.1 Demographics We considered the number of PFC responses to be significant (42 responses: 40 parents, 2 carers) given the ultra‐rare status of r(20): 17 responses were gathered from UK families where fewer than 30 are known to be affected. The HCP survey (23 responses: 14 neurologists, 6 dietitians or nutritional therapists, 2 pediatricians, 1 epilepsy specialist nurse) was initially intended for UK professionals but was expanded to Europe due to existing collaborations within complex epilepsies and ketogenic diet research.  Less than half (43%) of HCPs had experience treating at least one r(20) patient. 70% felt their experience was too limited to make a clinical inference regarding unique features of the condition. ADHD (14%) and autism (12%) were the most common co‐morbidities reported by PFCs.",eeffffe7-e9c2-4311-b9c9-5f507db92139
4,results1," Seizure onset and r(20) diagnosis most often occurred by age 12 (93% and 74%, respectively); 48% of patients were adults. 81% of patients were prescribed more than 2 AEDs, with one PFC respondent indicating “6 or more.” Seizure activity was ranked the most important healthcare management aim by PFCs and ranked equally important as behavior and cognition by HCPs. The majority of patients had tried nondrug treatments (not including Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT)), including vagal nerve stimulation (48%), medical marijuana (17%), steroids (14%), cognitive behavioral therapy (10%), food supplements, and other complementary medicine. PFCs indicated that quality of life would be most likely to improve through reduced AED side effects (76%), more effective medication (62%), and reduced pill burden (52%).  3.",5cc1d4f4-fcf8-4954-ba33-d7c9d07298b8
5,results2,"2 Ketogenic dietary therapy All neurologist HCP respondents indicated willingness to prescribe Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), with the majority (62%) reserving Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) for cases where 3‐4 AEDs have failed. 70% of PFCs recommended Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) by their clinician received advice more than 12 months after diagnosis. Nearly all (95%) of PFC respondents were familiar with Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), although only 50% reported having tried it. Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) was mostly initiated from tertiary neurology services (PFC report: 45% outpatient, 40% inpatient, 85% with fasting) at 8‐12 (40%) or 13‐17 (40%) years old. Two patients (10%) had commenced Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) autonomously, with no professional support. 90% followed the diet as recommended for a minimum of 3 months, but only 20% maintained it for over 2 years. Nutritional supplements and specialist food products were recommended.",8e6b2072-b117-4b76-96ce-c50273610976
6,results3," Ketosis and r(20) symptoms were monitored through blood ketone levels (clinic 22%, home 40%) and seizure frequency (clinic 35%, home 45%). HCPs monitored safety by a combination of lipid profiles (35%), electrolytes (35%), serum liver and kidney tests (35%), and weight, height and head circumference (30%). 75% of PFCs noted a change in r(20) symptoms within 6 months of initiating the diet. Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) effect on r(20) symptoms and side effects are listed in Table 1. AED prescription remained largely unchanged while on Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT): reduced (20%) or withdrawn (10%) in a minority of cases, but neurologists indicated they would be willing to adapt prescription or dose as appropriate. Professional support was reported as “the perfect amount” (35%), “moderate” (30%), or “adequate” (20%) by PFCs, but this was less than support provision perceived by HCPs.",36db4a84-bb2b-47f2-ad69-593c79cd7d4e
7,results7," HCP side effect question was completed by 5 neurologists, 1 dietitian, 1 pediatrician. PFC—patient, family, carer; HCP—healthcare professional.  John Wiley & Sons, Ltd3.3 Challenges and barriers Patients, families, and carers reported maintaining the diet while socializing or dining out was the most challenging aspect of Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) (60% “extremely” or “very difficult”); restricted meal options (55%), food taste and consistency (50%), and planning ahead (50%) were also major challenges. Conversely, affording extra/specialist groceries and understanding recipes/nutritional guidelines were not perceived as troublesome (each 20% “extremely” or “very difficult”). Patients discontinued Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) because of perceived ineffectiveness (35%), poor taste/diet restrictiveness (30%), negative side effects (30%), and/or concerns over long‐term health impact.",a751022c-9f04-4c2c-a1f4-4c2a9c252c8a
8,results8," It was noted that the current provision of adult Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) services within the National Health Service (NHS) is limited, leading to some patients withdrawing from the therapy and others unable to initiate it. Some hospitals were unable to cater to Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) needs required by pediatric inpatients. HCPs report barriers to Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) prescription as patient compliance concerns (39%), patients uninterested or concerned over side effects/impact (30%), and/or lack of funding (17%). PFC respondents that had not experienced Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) (50%) reported they did not want to try it because of poor taste/diet restrictiveness (33%), clinical advice (24%), difficulties presented by co‐morbidities (24%), and/or concerns over effectiveness, long‐term health impact, and limited time and resources for meal preparation.  3.",f7a759f9-392f-429b-b249-9a45d2bd0559
9,results9,"4 Research priorities Nearly one‐third (32%) of PFCs indicated they would be willing to follow a prescribed ketogenic diet as part of a research study; an additional 34% indicated “I’m not sure.” Potential research design and ethical considerations (eg, randomized controlled trial across Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) centers including cluster‐randomized designs) were further discussed at the workshop. Attendees also considered an ongoing trial assessing Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) in children under 2 years old (NCT02205931), an r(20) natural history and biomarker study in set‐up (University of Glasgow), and the existing opportunity to collect Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) safety and efficacy data specific to r(20) through wider EpiCARE studies. In conclusion, attendees strongly prioritized improving Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) access and awareness as new research.",0e2666e2-0e96-4501-8de5-22105ba1ef34
10,results10," A health economic analysis presenting the complexities of r(20) care, health utilities, and lifelong impact on quality of life for patients and families could highlight funding gaps, contribute to NICE access guidance, and encourage nationally agreed tariffs for complex epilepsies and dietary interventions. Establishing adult Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) services was considered paramount. An education campaign driven by Ring20 and Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) charities to improve awareness of dietary therapies and currently available support may also improve uptake and adherence.  4 ",a969058d-c081-4a0d-9a9a-f6d34524a4e3
11,discussion0," We present results of two comprehensive surveys consolidated by a workshop with r(20) patients, families and carers, and medical experts. To our knowledge, this is the first time Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) prescription and practice have been assessed in r(20). The majority of respondents ranked seizure control as the most important healthcare management aim. This, combined with the number of AEDs, complementary therapies, and nonprescription products used by patients, suggests the need for more effective frontline treatments. For some patients, Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) prompted significant improvement in seizure activity, cognition, and alertness. Side effects were most commonly mild with severe reactions absent or minimal. Nonetheless, close monitoring at home and in clinic is required, as one family and clinician reported an increase in seizure frequency.",7ed215cc-06e4-440a-9f5f-b27bf4a46416
12,discussion1,"  The high rate of co‐morbidities, behavioral problems, and cognitive impairment in r(20) can make implementing Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) extremely difficult for some families. Adhering to Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) requires commitment and organization, and will very likely have a significant impact on all family members. Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) is felt to be particularly difficult to maintain in social situations, which is an important aspect to consider as older teenagers and adults with r(20) are keen to lead normal lives with appropriate levels of support. Patient support groups and forums, as well as on‐call professional support, can be essential to adherence.  Presently, National Health Service (NHS) Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) is predominantly available for pediatric populations and many centers have extensive waiting lists.",9de5867b-128d-4762-9eda-48077b54c3f5
13,discussion2," Despite the typical early age at seizure onset, r(20) diagnosis is generally delayed and Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) initiation may occur only in the later teenage years. Some patients continue Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) for years, and others repeatedly return to its variations as symptoms or personal circumstances change. As almost half of our patient survey respondents have already transitioned into adult neurological services, there is an obvious need for adult Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) programmes.  A growing evidence base supports Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) as an effective and safe intervention in many types of drug‐refractory epilepsies, but further research is needed to understand the mechanisms of r(20) and its potential interaction with ketosis. Although Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) may not be suitable for every r(20) patient, there is a strong consensus that it should be considered as an early intervention.",472c0e72-4321-422b-85e2-d113adba00b7
14,discussion3," Education campaigns to address patient and family concerns, and increase professional awareness may benefit Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) prescription, support, and adherence. Further refining and adherence to NICE guidelines may encourage early implementation.  R(20) patients and families are, by necessity, very engaged with their healthcare. The majority are willing to consider research participation, but it must be practical and realistic to fit within complex care routines. Collaborating with similar epilepsy groups could greatly benefit research recruitment and impact. In the first instance, a detailed health economic analysis illustrating reduced acute care costs and improved quality of life may encourage more widespread National Health Service (NHS) Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) implementation.
