Tumor growth was recorded every 3 days starting from 2 weeks after inoculation by measuring two perpendicular diameters using the following formula: π/6 × length × width2.Then the nude mice were randomly distributed into two groups: a standard diet (standard diet (STD)) group and a ketogenic diet (KD) group. KD was given at a dose of 125 g/kg (Zeneca, Shenzhen, China), which was based on three preexperiments. Thus, the calorie intake of the KD-fed group was almost equal to the standard diet (STD)-fed group.

9,results0," Expression of key ketolytic enzymes BDH1/2 and OXCT1/2 in 33 cancer cell lines Expression levels of BDH1/2 and OXCT1/2 mRNAs in 33 cancer cell lines were determined by qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1, these key ketolytic enzymes were expressed in all cell lines, but their expression levels significantly varied in different lines. However, BDH1 and OXCT1 may play a more dominant role than BDH2 and OXCT2. For further experiments, we chose PANC-1 and HeLa cells with low and high expression levels of both BDH1 and OXCT1 mRNAs, respectively. We also detected the expression of the BDH1 and OXCT1 proteins in PANC-1 and HeLa cells by Western blotting analysis. The protein levels were consistent with mRNA expression levels (Fig. 1B).

During this study, we hypothesized that cancers with high glycometabolism (which means enhanced glycolysis in cancer cells here) may be characterized by a lower level of ketolytic key enzymes. Thus, we examined relevant glycometabolic markers: glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), transketolase like-1 (TKTL-1). However, no correlation between glycometabolism and ketone body metabolism was observed (supplementary Fig. S1).  Lack of effect of βHB-supplemented LG medium on the proliferation of PANC-1 cells Next, we found that the proliferation of PANC-1 and HeLa cells was significantly decreased during culturing in LG medium for 96 h compared with that in control, high glucose (25 mM) medium (P < 0.0001, Fig. 2).",5d16e709-775c-4f65-9264-7ee46c35959b

The highest infection efficiency was obtained at a multiplicity of infection value of 10 as more than 90% of HeLa cells showed green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal after lentivirus infection and selection by puromycin (Fig. 3A). Gene knockdown efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. BDH1 and OXCT1 mRNA expression levels were reduced to approximately 20% of those in control cells (Fig. 3B–D).",47e26ecd-bd7b-4b14-b000-50183edc2032

22,discussion0," In the present study, we investigated the relationship between the expression of the key ketolytic enzymes BDH1 and OXCT1 in tumors and their response to KD. We showed that xenograft tumors that derive from cancer cells with low expression levels of BDH1 and OXCT1 are more responsive to KD therapy, likely because they possess weaker ability to metabolize ketone bodies.  The Warburg effect is one of the most remarkable and ubiquitous metabolic phenotypes exhibited by most cancer cells (18). Exploiting metabolic characteristics of tumors and using targeted therapeutic strategy may prove effective against cancers of the same category. Theoretically, cancer metabolic deficiency caused by gene mutations or mitochondrial dysfunction can prevent cancer cells from effectively consuming ketone bodies as a source of energy (19). If a tumor is unable to utilize ketone bodies, the use of KD may be an effective therapy for selective nutrient starvation of such tumors.",beab3587-1695-4156-8b57-b3ace2d3fba9
23,discussion1," However, numerous reports about inconsistent efficacies of this treatment broke the illusion of the possibility to cure cancer thoroughly with KD therapy.  In our study, supplementing LG medium with βHB did not promote PANC-1 cell growth in vitro (Fig. 2A), whereas proliferation of HeLa cells was significantly increased by βHB (Fig. 2B). Similar results were observed in xenograft experiments in nude mice (Fig. 5A, B). Notably, HeLa cells apparently could not consume ketone bodies as fuel to promote proliferation when BDH1 and OXCT1, the main ketolytic enzymes, were knocked down simultaneously (Fig. 6A).  However, previous studies have shown ketone bodies (βHB and AcAc) may be much more than metabolites, having important cellular signaling roles as well (20, 21). It was unknown whether βHB promoted the proliferation of HeLa cells through some signaling pathways independent of its role in cell metabolism.",a982cc4c-0580-42fd-bcbe-7e1f5683d795
24,discussion2," Supplementation of control (high glucose) medium with 10 mM βHB did not affect proliferation of HeLa cells. This result indicates that the main role of βHB in HeLa cells is to serve as an energy source. Our results suggest that cancer cells with very low expression levels of BDH1 and OXCT1 may be sensitive to KD therapy. In relevance to this notion, in a recent clinical trial, Chang et al. (22) found differential expression of ketolytic enzymes (including BDH1 and OXCT1) in gliomas. They hypothesized that patients with low or very low expression of BDH1 and OXCT1 in malignant gliomas may respond better to KD therapy. Ketogenesis occurs in hepatic mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 7). AcAc and βHB are released to extrahepatic tissues mainly via monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT2 (23). The AcAc:βHB ratio is proportional to the mitochondrial NAD+:NADH ratio (often ∼30–70%).",244ab97f-065e-4ae0-9ab0-b3277931c344
25,discussion3," Thus, in an extrahepatic mitochondrion, BDH1 catalyses oxidation of βHB into AcAc, and then AcAc is transformed into AcAc-CoA in a near-equilibrium reaction catalyzed by OXCT1. Extraneous AcAc can be also converted into AcAc-CoA directly. In vitro, siR-BDH1 or siR-OXCT1 HeLa cells had limited proliferation in LG medium supplemented with βHB, which suggested that they partly retained the ability to consume βHB as energy source. However, KD did not inhibit growth of xenograft tumors derived from siR-BDH1 or siR-OXCT1 HeLa cells in nude mice. Due to a complex internal environment, we have not found a reasonable explanation for the observed phenomenon. We believe that these observations point to some unknown mechanism of ketone body metabolism.  Fig. 7. Metabolism of ketone bodies. Ketogenesis occurs in the hepatic mitochondrial matrix.Then AcAc and βHB are released to extrahepatic tissues via monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT2, mainly.",062910d8-0956-4c2c-aa4b-11cf9d4139fc
26,discussion4,"The AcAc/βHB ratio is proportional to the mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio (often ∼30% to 70%). BDH1 and OXCT1 are two ketolytic key enzymes. In the extrahepatic mitochondrion, BDH1 catalyzes βHB converting to AcAc and then AcAc is transformed into AcAc-CoA in a near-equilibrium reaction catalyzed by OXCT1.  We also determined the levels of BDH2 and OXCT2 that play a certain role in ketone body catabolism. BDH2 and OXCT2 levels in most cell lines were lower than those of BDH1 and OXCT1 (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that BDH2 catalyzes a rate-limiting step in the biogenesis of the mammalian siderophore and OXCT2 is a testis-specific isoform mostly expressed in testicular haploid germ cells (24, 25). Thus, during catabolism of the ketone body, BDH1 and OXCT1 may play a more dominant role than the isoforms BDH2 and OXCT2.  Cancer cells reactivate gene expression or metabolic pathways to achieve proliferation under nutrition-limiting conditions (26, 27).",28cb9167-79c4-4497-b778-d88e043a6b97
27,discussion5," In our study, we determined BDH1 and OXCT1 expression levels in transplanted tumors. Surprisingly, we did not observe increased expression of BDH1 and OXCT1 in tumors derived from PANC-1 cell xenografts. The lack of elevated expression of these two key ketone catabolism enzymes suggests that ketolysis was not activated in xenograft tumors. In contrast, qRT-PCR showed upregulated levels of BDH1 and OXCT1 in HeLa cell xenografts. Metabolic adaptations, such as reactivation of key ketone catabolism enzymes, may be one of the main reasons for failure of KD therapy on lung cancer cell xenografts.This metabolic adaptation can be also observed in nutrition-deprived hepatocellular carcinoma cells that employ ketone bodies for energy supply and cancer progress (28). Therefore, investigating the potential mechanism by which gene expression is reactivated may further enhance anti-tumor effects of KD therapy.",775019c5-ff34-4729-9d63-b75fde3a96bc
28,discussion6,"  In this study, we also observed that KD elevated blood βHB, decreased blood glucose, and lowered mouse body weight. (Fig. 5D). KD-fed mice had significantly higher ketone body concentrations, a feature which was also observed in other studies using a KD in tumor bearing mice (29). It may underlie the efficacy of KD therapy against cancer. These mice lost 10–20% of their body weight compared with standard diet (STD)-fed animals during the first week. Although the mean mouse body weight in the KD group was lower than that in the standard diet (STD) group at every time point, the difference during the last week was not statistically significant. These results were consistent with the data of several previous studies (30, 31). To avoid weight loss, KD was administered unlimitedly or with high energy content in most studies (7, 32). However, different nutrition ratios may significantly influence the efficacy of KD. In this study, we employed KD with the lipid:nonlipid ratio of 3:1.",715f77af-8484-486d-9feb-aab9aa26be9f
29,discussion7," In fact, 4:1 or 5:1 KD may have an even better effect than a 3:1 diet. However, animals do not always tolerate the higher fat proportion well (33). In addition, the KD even increased tumor growth and shortened the mean survival mice xenografted with HeLa cells. This finding suggests that HeLa cell-derived xenograft tumors actively consume ketone bodies as an energy source which led to significant growth of tumor tissue and energy deficit in normal tissue.  Nevertheless, overall, our results suggest that expression of the key ketolytic enzymes BDH1 and OXCT1 is one of the main factors that determine the effect of a KD on cancer. Tumors with low expression of BDH1 and OXCT1 may respond better to KD therapy than those with high expression of these proteins. BDH1 and OXCT1 may be very useful biomarkers to determine the sensitivity of a particular cancer to a KD. The use of BDH1 and OXCT1 inhibitors may enhance KD treatment efficiency and expand the anti-tumor spectrum of KD therapy.",1b52e177-390d-4eff-abfa-63abb1d43d62
30,discussion8," Further studies are necessary to determine whether other tumors derived from cancer cells with different expression levels of BDH1 and OXCT1 exhibit similar sensitivity to KD. Furthermore, the mechanism by which KD therapy activates BDH1 and OXCT1 expression should be elucidated. Finally, it is necessary to determine whether other sensitive indicators can also affect KD effectiveness.
