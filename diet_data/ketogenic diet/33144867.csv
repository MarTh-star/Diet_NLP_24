0,methods0," 3.1. Animals and Diets  Seven-week-old apoE–/– mice, purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were housed individually in stainless steel wire-bottom cages in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room. Only male mice were used to control for the known effect of gender on atherosclerosis in this strain [43]. The animals had free access to water and to one of the following diets prepared based on AIN 93M (Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA): a control diet (11 Kcal% fat, 70 Kcal% carbohydrate, 18 Kcal% protein), a KD diet (81 Kcal% fat, 1 Kcal% carbohydrate, 18 Kcal% protein and 0.15% cholesterol), or an lower content in methyl donors (LMKD) diet (80 Kcal% fat, 1 Kcal% carbohydrate, 19 Kcal% protein and 0.15% cholesterol) that was enriched in methionine and had reduced levels of methyl donors and vitamins (folate, choline, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12), as previously described in detail [13]. The macronutrient composition of the experimental diets is shown in Table 1.",9e0180ce-be12-4978-962e-a3f5823b9d0c
1,methods1," Diets were replaced once a week, at which time animals and the remaining food were weighed to determine food consumption and body weight progression. All procedures were performed in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Pennsylvania State University, which specifically approved this study.  3.2. Blood Collection  After mice were fed for 4, 8 and 12 weeks, blood was collected from the retro-orbital cavity into heparinized tubes and immediately placed on ice. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation at 4 °C and immediately stored at −80 °C prior to further biochemical analyses.  3.3. Aorta Collection and Preparation of Aorta Lysates  After 12 weeks, mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation and aortas were collected, as previously described in detail [13]. Briefly, aortas were perfused with 10 mL of cold phosphate saline buffer (phosphate saline buffer (PBS)).",1401500e-487e-4d27-b3b3-297d318909ce
2,methods2," Approximately one-third of each aorta was excised, transferred into 100 µL of a solution of acetonitrile, methanol and water (2:2:1) containing 0.1M HCl, immediately immersed into liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until the preparation of the aorta lysates described below. The remainder of each aorta, after perfusion with 10% neutral buffered formalin (neutral buffered formalin (NBF)) in phosphate saline buffer (PBS), was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) overnight and processed, as described in 3.5.1.  Aorta lysates were prepared by homogenization with 2.8 mm ceramic beads using a Bead Ruptor 12 (Omni, Kennesaw, GA, USA) with two cycles of 15 s at the maximum speed, with 30 s on ice between the cycles. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000× g and 4 °C for 10 min and immediately stored at −80 °C until AdoHcy and AdoMet analyses were performed.  3.4. Biochemical Analyses  3.4.1.",c5e09fb8-9938-4a06-885f-b8bd51922dca
3,methods3," Nutritional Ketosis  Plasma was tested for content of BHB using a colorimetric assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.  3.4.2. Homocysteine  Plasma tHcy was determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)) analysis adapted from the method of Araki and Sako [44].  3.4.3. Systemic Inflammation  MCP-1 was measured in duplicate using plasma collected at 4 weeks and 12 weeks, by ELISA (Meso Scale Diagnostics, Rockville, MD, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.  3.4.4. Plasma and Vascular Methylating Index  AdoMet and AdoHcy levels were measured in plasma and in aortic lysates using a liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, after using solid-phase extraction columns according to Gellekink et al. [45,46]. The stability of AdoMet and AdoHcy in plasma was shown to be 100% if samples were stored immediately at −80 °C [46].",c2c54081-4656-4b85-90bd-16fa1f29b5b2
4,methods4," To protect AdoMet in aortic lysates from degradation, 0.1M HCl was used to acidify the aortic lysates, after which samples were stored at −80 °C [45].  3.5. Aorta Processing and Assessment of Vascular Lesions  Fixed aortas were stained with Oil Red-O (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) to visualize adventitial fat removal during dissection [47]. Briefly, aortas were dehydrated in successive methanol–water solutions (25%, 50% and 78% methanol for 15 min each at room temperature, RT, with rocking). Aortas were then incubated in an Oil Red-O working solution (5 parts 2.8% Oil Red-O in methanol: 2 parts 1 M sodium hydroxide) for 2h at RT, with rocking. Subsequently, aortas were washed and rehydrated with successive phosphate saline buffer (PBS) solutions with the following methanol concentrations (%): 78, 50, 25 or 0 (15 min each solution, RT, rocking). Connective tissues surrounding the aortas were dissected away under a stereomicroscope.",decceb53-13b6-40a6-9e62-30e177b5c29f
5,methods5," The top of the heart attached, along with the aortic root, was removed. Complete staining of the atherosclerotic plaques with Oil Red-O was undertaken as previously described in detail [13,47]. Aortas were pinned out intact and photographed on each side.  14T-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Analysis  Aortas were equilibrated in a solution of 0.1% Magnevist (Bayer, Whippany, NJ, USA), 0.25% sodium azide in phosphate saline buffer (PBS) overnight at 4 °C, then placed into glass tubes (6 mm OD, 4 mm ID and 60 mm length) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis. Aortic plaque burden was then quantified using an Agilent 14T micro imaging system, as previously described in detail [13,48]. A gradient echo imaging sequence with an imaging time of 9 h 48 min was used to generate 3D datasets of the aortas [49]. Scan parameters included an echo time (TE) of 13 ms, a repetition time (TR) of 100.00 ms, eight averages, a field of view (field of view (FOV)) of 12.6 × 4.2 × 4.",a668239e-a1a5-4fa9-b981-53c0adba4d27
6,methods6,"2 mm3, and a matrix size of 630 × 210 × 210, resulting in an isotropic resolution of 20 µm. After acquisition, MR data was reconstructed using Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Zero-filling by a factor of 2 in each direction led to a final isotropic pixel resolution of 10 µm.  Data segmentation was performed using Avizo 9.5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The lumen of the aorta, the different plaques and the aorta wall were manually segmented using the lasso tool. Quantification of plaque volume was determined using the material statistics function in Avizo 9.5 on the segmented aorta. The results were expressed as the percent of plaque area in relation to the total segmented area (plaque, lumen, and wall).  3.6. Aorta Immunofluorescence Analysis: Specific Histone Methylation and Acetylation  Following magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis, aortas were equilibrated to 15%, then 30% sucrose solution was added as a cryoprotectant.",e11a48a3-2ec1-40a2-955c-c69e2ee80b36
7,methods7," Aortas were then further dissected to obtain arch and branch regions, grouped into arrays and embedded in Tissue-Tek® Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (OCT, Sakura® Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA). Twelve-µm thick tissue section arrays of each region were then mounted to TruBond™ 380 microscope slides, dried, and subjected to heat induced epitope retrieval (heat induced epitope retrieval (HIER)) as previously described in detail [13]. Following heat induced epitope retrieval (HIER), tissue arrays were then encircled with an ImmEdge PAP pen (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), blocked with 2% BSA, 1% NGS, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.05% sodium azide in phosphate saline buffer (PBS) (blocking buffer) and then incubated with primary antibodies in a blocking buffer overnight at 4°C.",2b6e4228-fef7-418a-ab1a-0200432312b3
8,methods8," After washing, arrays were incubated in secondary antibody for 1 h at RT, washed, treated with Vector® TrueVIEW® Autofluorescence Quenching Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and sealed under coverslips in VECTASHIELD® Vibrance™ Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). The antibodies used were: rabbit anti-histone H3K27me3 pAb (1:200, Epigentek, Cat.# A-4039), rabbit anti-histone H3K27ac pAb (1:200, Epigentek, Cat.#A-4708), mouse anti-histone H3 mAb 1B1-B2 (1:200, BioLegend, cat.#819404), Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:250, Invitrogen, Cat.# A-21428) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG3 (1:250, Invitrogen, Cat.# A-21151).  Immunofluorescence images were collected on an Olympus BX61 widefield fluorescence microscope at the Penn State Microscopy Facility (University Park, PA, USA). Images were segmented and quantified using FIJI [50], as previously described in detail [13].",8017e0eb-a8b7-44ae-a28e-56cefa91eb18
9,methods9," Briefly, the aortic or arterial tissue were segmented manually into regions of interest (ROIs). Histone H3 fluorescence was used to define nuclei within the vessel and fluorescence within these nuclei was measured for both the histone H3 and histone H3K27me3 or H3K27ac immunofluorescence images. Data were then calculated as a ratio of H3K27me3:H3 fluorescence or H3K27ac:H3 fluorescence to assess vascular changes in the corresponding epigenetic tags.  3.7. Statistical Analyses  Analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA), with statistical significance set to p < 0.05. For comparison of two groups, an unpaired Student’s t-test was used. For more than two groups, a one- or two-way analysis of variance (a one or two way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) was performed with adjustment for multiple comparisons (Tukey’s multiple comparisons test).  4.",89351807-d321-4762-86ee-ccdb8e41052a
10,methods10," Conclusions  In conclusion, a mild Hcy accumulation induced by a very low-carbohydrate diet containing low amounts of methyl donors promoted nutritional ketosis and systemic hypomethylation. Thus, the nutritional-induced manipulation of the Hcy metabolism was not affected by the BHB build-up in the lower content in methyl donors (LMKD) group. However, we did not detect any significant differences, at the p < 0.05 level, in the volume of vascular lesions between the groups under nutritional ketosis (i.e., KD and lower content in methyl donors (LMKD)). Nevertheless, the negative impact of the lower content in methyl donors (LMKD) on cell growth, by retarding plaque progression, may have contributed to this outcome. We also did not detect a significant difference in the AdoMet:AdoHcy ratio or specific histone methylation between these two groups of animals.",51f3ff1b-f9b9-452f-8ed6-e7ff630c3e27
11,methods11," However, the significance of these observations is limited, not only by the small number of animals used, but also because we did not assess the methylation status of other potential targets, as in, for example, the protein arginine methylation status [20,28,29]. Interestingly however, we could observe lower levels of the content of the epigenetic tag H3K27me3 in the aortas presenting a higher atherosclerotic burden (KD and lower content in methyl donors (LMKD)) versus the control, favoring the involvement of this epigenetic tag on the atherosclerotic process in this model. Lastly, the aortic concentration of the epigenetic tag H3K27ac was similar among the three groups of mice, albeit significant differences in vascular atheroma, showing that this epigenetic tag was independent of the H3K27me3 mark and the burden of atherosclerosis.",614377e2-cd75-475d-8bb4-95e2591dbe0e
12,methods12,"  The results of the present pilot study are supported by our previous report, in which mild HHcy was induced in the same animal model with diets with a different macronutrient profile, without favoring atherosclerosis progression [13]. Thus, this absence of vascular toxicity associated with mild HHcy may be independent of the macronutrient profile of the diet, i.e., in the presence of nutritional ketosis. Furthermore, these intriguing observations suggest that, in both studies, the levels of accumulated Hcy were insufficient to disturb vascular homeostasis. However, this possibility needs to be taken cautiously due to the limited number of animals used in both studies. Nevertheless, and interestingly, evidence collected in human studies also suggests that the magnitude of tHcy build-up determines the correspondent vascular phenotype. In fact, lowering plasma tHcy in patients with severe HHcy drastically reduces the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular disease (CVD) events [5].",c12d4c61-4bd3-4753-ba70-e7585ee9f509
13,methods13," However, this same intervention in patients with mild HHcy will decrease cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk only if the baseline plasma tHcy is above a certain threshold [51].  As mentioned repletely above, one limitation of the current pilot study is the small sample size, as the analyses performed are all labor-intensive. However, a strength is that we have tested a mild form of HHcy, such as may be likely in humans [5]. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that confirmatory studies with a higher number of animals should confirm these pilot observations. Additional studies are being conducted to assess how a more profound accumulation of Hcy impacts vascular methylation status and atherosclerosis progression. ",a31a77f7-de47-434c-b797-27784ef25ba5
