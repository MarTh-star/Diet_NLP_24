0,background0,"The ketogenic diet prescribes a significant reduction in carbohydrate intake, which facilitates physiological changes that promote the utilization of ketones [1]. Recently this diet has received attention from the endurance community as a potential ergogenic aid because it minimizes the body’s reliance on carbohydrates. Despite evidence-based guidance for athletes to consume adequate carbohydrates [2], it has been proposed that the biological constraints of carbohydrate storage may limit athletes who compete over extended time periods [3, 4]. Carbohydrates are stored in the body predominately as glycogen in muscle tissue (300 g) and liver tissue (90 g), in addition to glucose in the blood stream (30 g) [5]. This amounts to roughly 1680 kcal of available energy from carbohydrate at any one time. As a result, endurance athletes must replenish their glycogen stores every one to three hours during activity [5].",2a60779a-ddf2-42b1-9eae-a6f6103e69c8
1,background1," This continual consumption redirects nutrients from exercising muscles to the gut to aide digestion, potentially leading to reduced exercise economy and digestive disturbances, which compromise the athlete’s ability to maximize training and competition outcomes [3]. Additionally, research indicates that training with low muscle glycogen availability promotes molecular changes that enhance training-derived endurance adaptations [6]. Furthermore, ketogenic diets have been shown to reduce lactate accumulation after exercise, contributing to enhanced recovery [7, 8]. Taken together, this evidence suggests that reduced reliance on carbohydrates via ketosis can produce beneficial results for endurance athletes.  In contrast to the limitations of carbohydrate storage, the body can reserve large amounts of energy in the form of fat. One pound of fat yields approximately 3500 kcal, making fat a vast source of energy, even among relatively lean endurance athletes.",d21469a3-e431-4f83-8bc4-6e5953d3d618
2,background2," In theory, if endurance athletes tolerate the ketogenic diet, they could achieve longer training periods with sustained energy levels and reduced need for refueling, allowing them to maximize the aerobic benefits from training and competing. In fact, there is some evidence that, among highly trained individuals, benefits of the diet include a steady supply of energy for the body and brain during prolonged exercise and accelerated recovery time post-exercise [4]. While scientists continue to explore potential benefits and drawbacks of the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD)), several public figures in the athletic community have already embraced the diet as ergogenic [9, 10]. However, to the authors’ knowledge, there have been no systematic reviews of endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) consumption and endurance outcomes (e.g.",415a7b66-abd0-48fb-a6a2-cc6cc068fe09
3,background3,", VO2 max, Time to exhaustion (TTE), Race Time, Rating of perceived exertion (RPE), Peak Power) from which such conclusions may be drawn.  To fill this gap, the present review characterizes the nature and extent of available scientific evidence regarding the claim that endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) consumption results in improved endurance performance, as measured by maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max). VO2 max is considered the gold standard for measuring aerobic fitness. It is measured via a graded exercise test on a treadmill or a cycle ergometer, and quantified as the body’s maximum oxygen use in milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute [11]. Higher levels of VO2 max indicate greater endurance capacity. It is important to note that while VO2 max is an established measure of endurance capacity, relative VO2 max is confounded by changes in body weight and thus not without limitations. For this reason, secondary performance outcomes (i.e.",71af9b4d-7d4a-48e1-917a-7ee69774d601

This manuscript is intended to enhance the athletic and scientific communities’ knowledge of the potential benefits and consequences of adopting the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD), and to identify gaps in the current literature that may create opportunities for future study. Specifically, this review focuses on peer-reviewed articles examining endurance athletes (e.g., cyclists, runners, race walkers, triathletes) participating in three or more weeks of endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) consumption. The included studies looked at a variety of outcomes; however, the primary outcome of interest to this review is VO2 max.  Main text",cab74ceb-7e4b-4122-8210-2146698ebfbb

All studies explicitly reported tracking serum ketone levels as a biomarker for ketosis. All studies lasted between three and 12 weeks.  Performance outcome results VO2 max outcomes (mL/kg/min; n = 6 studies) were mixed: two studies reported significant increases in VO2 max across all diets [7, 12], and four reported no significant VO2 max outcomes [14–17].

27,discussion0,"It has been hypothesized that consuming a ketogenic diet may enhance performance among endurance athletes by promoting a shift in substrate utilization that enhances physiological training benefits [3, 18]. The present review explores this hypothesis by examining associations between endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) consumption and VO2 max, a biomarker for endurance capacity [11]. Two of the seven studies included in this review found a significant increase in VO2 max post-endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) consumption [7, 12]. However, both articles reported significant VO2 max increases across all diets, and that outcomes were independent of dietary intervention. Interestingly, both studies were conducted among elite race walkers that self-selected their dietary intervention, and the athletes that self-selected into the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) had slightly higher average baseline and post-treatment VO2 max values [7, 12]. Furthermore, Burke et al.",878a9f96-dd5b-4fe7-8856-bfc4b9535347
28,discussion1,", reported that VO2 max values for the high carbohydrate comparison group were significantly lower than endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) or periodised carbohydrate groups at baseline and follow-up (p ≤ 0.02) [12]. This suggests that other factors may influence athletes’ choice of diet and aerobic capacity concomitantly, such as genetic variation in trainability and/or chronic substrate utilization [19, 20]. A review conducted by Williams et al. revealed the potential for 97 genes to predict VO2 max trainability, suggesting that genetics may account for differing training outcomes among athletes [20]. Certain dietary preferences, which both acutely and chronically influence substrate utilization, have also been linked to gene variations, highlighting the possibility for both dietary choices and training outcomes to be mediated by genetics [19, 21].",21b19bc2-81b3-4906-a843-374f4f3e228d
29,discussion2," Randomized controlled trials and genome-wide association studies can be leveraged to control for, and explore the impact of, such factors in future studies of the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD).  Four of the seven studies reviewed reported non-significant VO2 max outcomes [14–17]. In a non-randomized trial, McSwiney et al. reported a VO2 max increase in both groups of male endurance athletes post-endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) (endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD): 53.6 ± 6.8 vs. 57.3 ± 6.7; HCD: 52.6 ± 6.4 vs. 57.2 ± 6.1) with a non-significant difference between groups (p = 0.968) [14]. In a pre-posttest design, Phinney et al. reported a non-significant decrease in VO2 max from baseline among five elite male cyclists (pre- vs. post-endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD): 5.10 ± 0.18 vs. 5.00 ± 0.20; p > 0.01) [15]. In a case study, Zinn et al.",4a5218bf-2823-4a51-9d1b-ce6101805065
30,discussion3," reported a non-significant decrease among five recreational endurance athletes consuming the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) (− 1.69 ± 3.4; p = 0.63) [17]. Finally, in a randomized crossover study, Shaw et al. reported no significant changes from baseline (59.4 ± 5.2) among male endurance athletes during either dietary intervention (p > 0.05) [16].  Heatherly et al. did not report VO2 max outcomes, instead providing the percentage of baseline VO2 max achieved at various race paces (i.e., 5 km, 10 km, 21 km, 42 km, sub-42 km) [13]. The significantly greater percentages of baseline VO2 max achieved post-endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) consumption at 10 km, 21 km, 42 km, and sub-42 km race paces demonstrate that the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) was negatively correlated with the athletes’ aerobic efficiency at these paces.",ced17495-f7be-4acd-a484-ad712102ae55
31,discussion4," This is corroborated by some of the secondary outcomes reported in Table 2, including reports of endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) being associated with significantly higher Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) [12], and decreased Time to exhaustion (TTE) [17]. Only one study reported significant positive secondary findings: a higher peak power in athletes post-endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) compared to the standard, high carbohydrate diet [14]. The authors of the study hypothesized that this outcome was likely due to an improved power to weight ratio among the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) athletes, who lost an average of 6 kg of body mass.  Despite the popularity of the diet as an ergogenic aid, this review provides evidence that endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) consumption produces mixed results, in terms of endurance performance, when compared to a high carbohydrate diet.",2eca15f5-89c7-4bf8-9ec4-06139c8a88f1
32,discussion5," Several biological mechanisms may help to explain the potential for mixed and/or detrimental effects, including changes in fuel economy, production of certain metabolic byproducts, and reduced energy intake. For example, the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) significantly increases fat oxidation, requiring greater oxygen consumption due to the increased oxygen demands during fatty acid metabolism versus carbohydrate metabolism [12, 22]. This increased demand for oxygen reduces the beneficial impact of an increased VO2 max because a greater percentage of maximal oxygen uptake is now required to maintain any given race pace [13]. Second, endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) metabolites such as tryptophan and ammonia may promote fatigue by influencing the central nervous system [23, 24]. Finally, it has been shown that the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) leads to increased satiety and reduced energy intake [25].",839a1e9a-94bd-4ee0-ad4a-20ce93552647
33,discussion6," Reduced energy intake, and the accompanying weight loss, may be beneficial for some individuals but could also present a sustainability issue for highly active athletes. Substantial reductions in body weight may negatively impact mental, hormonal, and bone health, as well as recovery time and general exercise performance [26, 27]. Illustrating these mechanisms, Heatherly et al. reported that athletes exhibited greater oxygen consumption at race pace on the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) versus a high carbohydrate diet and that ad libitum endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) consumption resulted in decreased intake of roughly 1000 kcal per day, leading to a 3 % loss of body mass over the study period [13].  In multiple studies, participant self-reports (e.g.",1a6bc2b8-4e90-4c8e-8781-982f6a118e71
34,discussion7,", interview data, training logs) suggested that the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) may have promoted perceived fatigue and decreased ability to train for certain athletes [17], particularly those training in summer months [13]. This could be a combined result of the alterations in fuel economy, metabolism, and energy intake described above, though not all athletes reported experiencing negative side effects. Based on focus group results, one study reported that athletes had more positive than negative perceptions of the diet [17], suggesting that there may be additional unknown variables influencing endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) outcomes across individuals and/or settings (e.g., temperature, humidity [13]).  One hypothesis for the variation in performance outcomes among studies might stem from the heterogeneity across the training/recovery protocols and fitness levels of the athletes [28].",cb12083e-4007-4f34-b185-1a6e33c2114c
35,discussion8," Both studies exhibiting a statistically significant increase in VO2 max examined the effects of endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) consumption in professional race walkers with high base levels of aerobic capacity, a factor that has been associated with faster recovery times and greater positive adaptations to training [29–31]. Both studies also explicitly included a recovery protocol in their training prescription, which could impact the athletes’ training outcomes [28]. Due to limited information on training/recovery protocols in many of these studies, strong conclusions cannot be generated regarding the impact of training versus diet on performance outcomes. However, based on previous evidence, it is reasonable to hypothesize that these protocol differences may have contributed to the diverse outcomes reported [6, 28, 32].  In examining the results, it is important to bear in mind that this review consists of just seven studies, only one of which was randomized [16].",6d3b776d-6c25-4355-ad19-c2bc3b9097b9
36,discussion9," Carr et al., Burke et al., and McSwiney et al. were all prospective trials, however they allowed participants to choose their dietary intervention [7, 12, 14]. Although this self-selection method generally improves rates of adherence to the diets, it also introduces risk of bias in that those athletes who chose the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) may have other lifestyle or dietary tendencies that could affect their biological response to the diet. Heatherly et al. and Phinney et al. were pre-posttest studies, which are subject to threats to internal validity, such as the fact that passage of time results in natural decreases in VO2 max [13, 15]. Finally, Zinn et al. was a case study [17]. Although the article provides a wealth of hypothesis generating observations, without a comparison group we cannot conclude whether the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) was more or less effective than the standard, high carbohydrate diet for athletes.",b20739b1-4bdf-4064-98f4-df434bfbf5eb
37,discussion10,"  All studies had relatively small sample sizes, which reduced the statistical power of the analyses. It is possible that, with a larger sample size, the seven studies might have exhibited corroboratory results. The small sample sizes also exacerbated the problem of drop-out rates, which were considerable in one of the five studies. McSwiney et al. lost 18 participants in the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) group and nine in the comparison group, resulting in a participation rate of 33 and 55%, respectively [14].  At the review level, heterogeneity in dietary interventions, adherence measurements, VO2 max testing procedures, training protocols, and athlete types all introduced variation that made comparisons across studies difficult. For example, four studies measured VO2 max using a treadmill test [7, 12, 13, 16], while the other three studies used a cycle ergometer [14, 15, 17].",4f576ab7-8bd8-4c3b-a935-8ddc26ee2c08
38,discussion11," Previous reviews suggest that these two testing procedures produce inconsistent results, with higher VO2 max outcomes reported for treadmill as compared to cycle ergometer tests [33]. Therefore, inter-article comparisons of the change in VO2 max by diet from baseline may be more reliable than inter-article comparisons of the absolute outcome values reported. Furthermore, research suggests that VO2 max may be an inaccurate predictor of endurance performance in runners, specifically due to variations in running economy and fatigue [34, 35]. Therefore, VO2 max may not be a strong indicator of endurance capacity in some sports, further complicating this measure as a comparison across heterogeneous groups of athletes.  In addition to VO2 max outcomes, Table 2 provides a matrix of secondary outcomes (i.e., Time to exhaustion (TTE), race time, Rating of perceived exertion (RPE), peak power), which can be used to complement the VO2 max findings from this review.",460bfa6b-1473-4e73-b3f3-6d19fe1a939b
39,discussion12," For example, although all three diet groups in the study by Burke et al. experienced a significant increase in VO2 max from baseline, only the comparison groups (i.e., high carbohydrate, periodised carbohydrate) experienced faster 10 km race walk times. Furthermore, the endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) group reported significantly higher Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) values compared to baseline during a graded economy test. Future research in this field can benefit from utilizing a variety of performance metrics, such as the ones discussed in this review, to triangulate overall effects of diet on athletic performance, limiting biases introduced from relying on one marker alone. Additionally, as this research area develops, it may be prudent to conduct reviews among athletes of a single type (e.g., runners only, cyclists only) to limit the heterogeneity among studies.",c178651c-a534-49ab-ba16-afdee7df66a5
40,discussion13,"  Because only two databases were used to identify articles for review, it is possible that other studies of endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) and endurance performance do exist in the literature. However, exploratory investigations of other databases retrieved no additional articles that met inclusion criteria. It is noteworthy that six of seven studies included in this review were published within the last 5 years, suggesting that scientific attention to this topic is fairly recent. Due to the contemporary nature of the research question, it is also possible that yet-to-be-published research exists on this topic. Therefore, future reviews may eventually produce more conclusive evidence. Finally, the potential risk of reporting bias is always present. Unfortunately, it is difficult to assess publication bias because we cannot know the extent of the evidence that has gone unpublished.",da96135d-68cd-457e-bc16-07320b41dad6
41,discussion14," However, due to the controversial nature of this topic among scientists and lay people alike, it seems likely that both significant and null findings would be publishable.  Conclusions Despite popular interest in the ketogenic diet as an ergogenic aid in endurance sport, there are few published studies examining the effect of endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) consumption on VO2 max and other outcomes (i.e., Time to exhaustion (TTE), race time, Rating of perceived exertion (RPE), peak power). When compared to a high carbohydrate diet, there are mixed findings for the effect of endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD) consumption on endurance performance. This may be partially due to the heterogeneity across studies and/or variability in athletes’ individual genetic factors, especially those that directly influence metabolism.  The limited number of published studies point to a need for more research in this field.",adc56a99-f87c-4e58-9803-d66d41fc7445
42,discussion15," Specifically, randomized studies performed in mixed sex samples are needed. Researchers might also consider examining endurance athlete’s ketogenic diet (EAKD)-like diets that do not induce ketosis.
