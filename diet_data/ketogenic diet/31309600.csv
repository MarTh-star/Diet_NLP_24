0,methods0,"2.1 Study details 2.1.1 Study design The trial was registered prior to the recruitment commencement (Clinical Trials # NCT02984540). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Wake Forest School of Medicine and was conducted in the Wake Forest Clinical Research Units. All protocols related to the cohorts involved in the study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Wake Forest School of Medicine. Details about the study design, participants, recruitment, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and dietary intervention have been provided in our previous reports [24, 42]. Briefly, the study was a randomized, double-blind, crossover, single-center pilot trial that included 17 subjects (mean age: 64.6 ± 6.4 yr) of which 11 participants were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) on the basis of ADNI-2 criteria for early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (http://www.adni-info.",115debc0-998f-4505-87f0-04c6fcd0208f

The primary goal of the original study was to examine the effects of modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) and American Heart Association Diet (AHAD) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, neuroimaging measures, peripheral metabolic measures, and cognition, as already published elsewhere [42].  2.1.2 Study participants Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants and/or their study partners or legal representatives. Participants were medically monitored by the clinicians, and safety supervision was monitored by the Wake Forest Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Committee as described previously [42].",d92e3c70-54ca-4a9f-94a9-1b9f1de38a7c
2,methods2," The study was originally projected and designed for the recruitment of 30 participants for the dietary intervention study, with at least 20 subjects completing both diets at study completion, thereby generating a greater sample size than that used in other studies reporting the beneficial effect of a 6-week ketogenic diet intervention on verbal memory in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects [55] and therefore also increasing the power to detect the diet's effect in the study groups. In addition, the crossover design of the study increased the power and reduced the outcome variability in that each subject served as their own control for the individual effects of diets. The present study finally included only those 17 subjects that were able to provide stool specimen at each time-point of the two dietary arms.",5129522a-5a3d-4928-81e3-bf7a882acc70
3,methods3," Exclusion criteria included previous diagnosis of neurological/ neurodegenerative disorder (other than mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), stroke, major psychiatric disorder, use of anti-diabetic and lipid-lowering medication, or medications with known central nervous system effects i.e., anti-seizures, anti-psychotics, and opioids. Subjects with well-controlled depression were permitted.  2.1.3 Procedure All subjects underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) at the baseline and end of diet 1 and again at the end of diet 2. Fresh fecal specimens were collected at baseline and end of each diet arm. All experimental procedures and samplings were executed in accordance with ethical and biosafety protocols approved by the Institutional guidelines. All study personnel involved in collecting and analyzing the data remained blinded to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) status or diet intervention allocation throughout the study.",1cd77cad-a471-4c0f-83ec-a6ccb07e91e2
4,methods4," Diagnoses, eligibility and inclusion/exclusion criteria were evaluated by expert physicians and neuropsychologists based on the data of cognitive testing, medical history, physical examination and clinical laboratory, as per the criteria described previously [42].  2.2 Dietary intervention Participants were randomly assigned to either a modified Mediterranean-style ketogenic diet (modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD)) or an American Heart Association Diet (American Heart Association Diet (AHAD)) intervention for six-weeks followed by a six-week washout period in which participants were instructed to resume their pre-study diet, following which the second diet was consumed for six weeks. Simple randomization was implemented by a registered dietitian at the beginning of the study. Daily meal plans were formulated by the study dietitian on the basis of food preferences and caloric needs.",b51c103a-0c8c-40c6-bf54-854d40b2b8a4
5,methods5," Diets were designed with the following structure: (1) modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD): The low-carbohydrate diet consisted of a diet plan of not more than 20 gs of carbohydrates per day to be consumed over the six-week period. Foods with high levels of healthy fats (and low in saturated fats) were generously incorporated in the meal plan. Various lean meats, fish, and nutrient-rich foods meeting the criterion of under 20 gs total carbohydrates per day were included in the diet plans. Carbohydrates were estimated to make up for not more than 10% of total caloric intake. Subjects on this diet were provided with 2 liters of extra virgin olive oil at study visits to incorporate into their individualized meal plans. (2) American Heart Association Diet (AHAD): The low-fat diet consisted of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet plan to be consumed over the 6 weeks.",e1977947-ab35-451a-b66f-fd4fa26b188e
6,methods6," Subjects were encouraged to restrict the amount of fat intake to not more than 40 gs per day, while eating ample fruits, vegetables, and adequate carbohydrate-containing fiber. Various lean meats and other protein sources were included in the plan. Carbohydrates were estimated to make up for 50–60% of total caloric intake. Overall, the intended macronutrient composition (% of total calories) was <10% carbohydrate, 60–65% fat and 30–35% protein for the MKMD, and 55–65% carbohydrate, 15–20% fat and 20–30% protein for the American Heart Association Diet (AHAD). While on the MKMD, subjects received extra virgin olive oil and were encouraged to eat fish, lean meats, and nutrient rich foods. While on the American Heart Association Diet (AHAD), subjects were directed to restrict their fat intake to <40 gs/day while eating fruits, vegetables and fiber-containing carbohydrates.  2.3 Fecal bacterial and fungal microbiome analysis 2.3.",340179ac-19ab-4677-9e46-5285804ca50c
7,methods7,"1 Microbiome measurement The bacterial and fungal microbiome were analyzed according to the Earth Microbiome Project (Earth Microbiome Project (EMP)) benchmarked protocol [56] (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org), by employing a barcoded high-throughput sequencing approach as described by Caporaso et al. [57]. Briefly, the fecal samples were stored at −80 °C as soon as possible after collection until microbial DNA extraction. To avoid the influence of DNA extraction, PCR conditions and primers on community composition recovered by amplicon sequencing, all samples were processed simultaneously and identically in order to minimize biasing the fungal community composition. The details of fecal bacterial (16S rRNA gene) sequencing, analysis and diet-effects have been provided in our previous report [24].",20734427-ce70-406b-bdff-9ac82eb6623d
8,methods8," The fungal amplicon libraries were prepared using the primer pair targeting the internal transcribed spacer (internal transcribed spacer (ITS)), a region of the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron known to allow effective identification across a broad range of fungal taxa [58]. The DNA was extracted using the MoBio PowerFecal kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) as per the manufacturer's instructions, and the first internal transcribed spacer region (internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1) of the fungal rRNA gene was amplified using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1f (5′-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)2 (5′-GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC) primer pair. Both the forward and reverse primers also had appropriate Illumina adapters, primer pad, and 2-bp linker sequences with the reverse primer containing a 12-bp error-correcting barcode unique to each sample to achieve multiplex capability. All primers were synthesized at the Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).",f55e3ff6-1d59-468d-bc7a-a573cb45fc8a
9,methods9," The PCR amplification reaction was performed as described previously [24, 59]. The resulting amplicons were purified using Agencourt® AMPure® XP magnetic purification beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA); quantified using the Qubit-3 fluorimeter (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and dsDNA HS assay kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA); and the amplicon library was generated according to methods of Caporaso et al. [57]. The purified PCR product was pooled in equal molar concentrations and sequenced on one 2 × 300-bp Illumina MiSeq run (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) for paired-end sequencing. Negative controls were mock samples that contained all reagents, including barcoded primers but without any extracted DNA that went through PCR and sequencing processes.  2.3.2 Microbiome analysis The sequencing quality control was executed with on-board Miseq Control Software and Miseq Reporter (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).",3034b12f-58d7-47c4-b103-766fad5badd6
10,methods10," The resultant paired-end reads were demultiplexed and were assigned to individual samples based on their unique barcode. The taxonomic classification of fungal rRNA targeted amplicon reads was performed by using the Illumina Fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) Metagenomics workflow (Illumina Inc.) using default parameters. Briefly, the naive-Bayes high-performance implementation of the RDP (Ribosomal Database Project)-classifier algorithm was performed as described by Wang et al. [60]. The taxonomic identification was performed on the basis of clustering at 97% similarity level against the UNITE Fungal database (alpha-version 7.2, 2017 release; https://plutof.ut.ee/#/doi/10.15156/BIO/587481) for the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1 region [61]. A total of 2399,527 sequences were obtained of which 1842,661 sequences (mean 21,678 sequences/sample) were retained after quality-filtering using default parameters.",649e5d6f-c3f3-4edc-8573-1dad816edff0
11,methods11," To avoid the bias of sequencing errors or low-level contaminations, the OTUs with very small read count (less than 4) in very few samples (less than 10% prevalence) were filtered out from the subsequent analyses. The data of taxon abundance were subjected to the total sum scaling and the taxa with less than 1% mean relative abundance were further excluded from the subsequent downstream analyses. Fungal community composition of each sample was measured at taxonomic levels of phyla, classes, orders, families and genera.  2.4 Lumbar puncture, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers assays, and ApoE ε−4 genotyping The procedures and analysis of lumbar puncture, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers assays, and ApoE ε−4 genotyping have been detailed elsewhere [42, 62].",17a68250-3a47-44d4-a21d-b3e71cf0b064
12,methods12," Briefly, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (25 ml) was collected using a 20 gage Sprotte spinal needle and polypropylene tubes (as per the standardized best practice guidelines of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center) in the morning times after an over-night fast. cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was aliquoted (200 µL) into pre-chilled polypropylene tubes, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C. AD biomarkers (Aβ−42, Aβ−40, tau and tau-p181) were measured by using the AlzBio3 multiplex assay (FujiRebio, Europe). Subjects were stratified on the basis of the carriage of the ApoE ε−4 allele, a well-established risk factor for AD that predicts insulin response, per our previously described method [63].  2.",ef83f894-a2d1-4f2b-9cca-bd50d9dad009
13,methods13,"5 Fecal lactate and SCFAs analyses Fecal concentrations of lactate and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including acetate, propionate and butyrate were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Waters-2695 Alliance HPLC, MA, USA) system as described in our previous report [24].  2.6 Data analysis The beta-diversity of the mycobiome was assessed using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and was visualized with the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) in R statistical software package (version 3.6.1; www.r-project.org). Alpha diversity measures included species richness (number of OTUs) and evenness (Shannon index). Random forest supervised learning model was applied on normalized data within R (model_randomForest; 70% training and 30% testing modules; trees = 500) to identify the major fungal taxa whose abundance is affected by the modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) and American Heart Association Diet (AHAD) intervention.",9e30f872-9404-4f5f-9fe0-77491279110d
14,methods14, The subsequent statistical significance of taxon abundance (and alpha-diversity) was assessed with two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test when comparing two sample groups or with analysis of variance (ANOVA) in case of more than two groups. Fungal taxa uniquely modulated by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) status and dietary interventions and driving differences between different groups were determined by using the biomarker discovery algorithm LEfSE (Linear discriminatory analysis [Linear discriminatory analysis (LDA)] Effect Size) with Linear discriminatory analysis (LDA) score >2.0 and p-value <0.05 [64]. Spearman correlations of fungal taxa with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and fecal bacterial taxa were calculated in GraphPad Prism software (version 6.0). Co-occurrence networks between fungal and bacterial taxa were calculated by using the open-source software Gephi (version 0.9.2; www.gephi.org).,8a32c700-90ec-466c-8ad5-ecd72a24e9bf
15,methods15," Modularity-based co-occurrence networks between fungal and bacterial taxa were analyzed at a Spearman correlation cutoff of 0.5 and p-value <0.05. Volcano plots depicting log2-fold changes in the fungal taxa during the dietary interventions were created within R. Hierarchical clustering heat-maps were constructed within R using the ‘heatmap.2′ package. Unless otherwise stated, all the values presented herein are mean ± SEM. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant unless specified.  3  We measure gut mycobiome by sequencing of the fungal rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1 gene in 17 older adults (11 mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 6 cognitively normal [CN]) in a single-center, randomized, double-blind, crossover pilot study, before and after 6 weeks intervention of modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) and American Heart Association Diet (American Heart Association Diet (AHAD)),",e39a9ef3-1885-44a5-b6a6-3c1479d25104

Findings Compared to CN counterparts, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have higher proportion of families Sclerotiniaceae, Phaffomyceteceae, Trichocomaceae, Cystofilobasidiaceae, Togniniaceae and genera Botrytis, Kazachstania, Phaeoacremonium and Cladosporium and lower abundance of Meyerozyma. Specific fungal taxa exhibit distinct correlation arrays with AD markers and gut bacteria in subjects with versus without mild cognitive impairment (MCI). modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) induces broader effect on fungal diversity in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and increases Agaricus and Mrakia while decreasing Saccharomyces and Claviceps with differential response in subjects with or without mild cognitive impairment (MCI).",98c66159-debb-4708-a41c-3a30b18cd151
17,methods17,"  Interpretation The study reveals mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-specific mycobiome signatures and demonstrates that distinct diets modulate the mycobiome in association with AD markers and fungal-bacterial co-regulation networks in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The findings corroborate the notion of considering gut mycobiome as a unique factor that can affect cognitive health/AD by interacting with gut bacteria and diet and facilitate better understanding of the AD and related microbiome, using unique diet or microbiome modulators.",e925f98e-439b-4578-b949-cf1015ecf158

Specific dietary patterns can be an efficient mean to prevent or delay the progression of the disease. Compared to cognitively normal counterparts, patients with mild cognitive impairment harbor distinct gut bacterial signatures that correlate with AD's pathological markers in the cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) and could play a potential role in AD pathogenesis. A modified Mediterranean-style ketogenic diet (modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD)) has been found to improve the profiles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers and modulate the gut bacterial microbiome in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).",92d81733-bfce-4d99-b64e-9bccf16b56cb
20,methods20,"  Added value of this study This is the first study to examine the gut fungal microbiome (mycobiome) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) while also evaluating the effect of modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) on gut mycobiome in association with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers and gut fungal-bacterial co-occurrence network. The study identifies mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-specific gut mycobiome signatures and demonstrates how these signatures correlate with gut bacteria as well as with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers including the deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ)−40, Aβ−42 and total and phosphorylated tau. The study also demonstrates how modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) distinctly modulates the gut mycobiome and fungal-bacterial co-regulation networks in associations with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers in subjects with or without mild cognitive impairment (MCI).",b418467c-19f2-40fd-94d3-1c3e0e3a3e30
21,methods21,"  Implications of all the available evidence Our growing understanding of the role of gut microbiome in AD pathobiology − irrespective of whether the role is causative or consequence − could open novel hypotheses in the field and inspire further investigation of potential gut microbial signatures and associated dysbiosis and dysfunctions of gut-brain axis that might contribute to dementia, cognitive decline and AD progression in high-risk subjects. Gut microbiome may be one of the factors to consider in the prevention and/or amelioration of AD and related dementia and cognitive impairment particularly in the elderly.  Alt-text: Unlabelled box    1 INTRODUCTION Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that affects over 40 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of dementia and cognitive decline particularly in older adults [1].",1aa0b68a-c7df-42de-b1ce-86d45988a61f
22,methods22," Despite extensive research on genetic and molecular risk factors of AD pathogenesis, no therapy is currently available to prevent or slow AD progression, which underlines the complexity and our inadequate knowledge of disease mechanisms while also stressing the need for exploring novel therapeutic targets and unconventional interventions to control this devastating condition. AD pathology is characterized by extracellular accumulations of amyloid-β-peptides (Aβ) in the senile plaques, and by intracellular depositions of hyper-phosphorylated tau proteins that forms neurofibrillary tangles [2]. Genetically, subjects carrying Apolipoprotein E (Apolipoprotein E (APOE)) allele ε−4 are at higher risk for AD as compared to subjects with ε3 and ε2 alleles [3]. However, emerging evidence shows that the AD pathogenesis is much more complex than previously believed and that the brain amyloid deposition might antedate clinical indications by 10–20 years [4].",cdf7bf16-d8d0-4b2c-a23b-17ed88b58e29
23,methods23," Studies have shown that AD involves chronic inflammation in the central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)) as well as in the periphery and that the amyloid plaques are consequence of years of chronic inflammation [5], [6], [7]. To the contrary, mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) is characterized by a state of cognitive deterioration (with relatively preserved activities of daily living) that precedes the clinical symptoms of dementia and AD [8, 9]. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at an increased risk for developing dementia and AD [10, 11] and hence interventions during mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stages are important for ameliorating AD progression.  Recent multiple evidences suggest that gut microbiome play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18].",71aa34f8-0979-4ccb-b76c-bbade2e12248
24,methods24," Studies have shown the implication of gut-brain axis − an integrated network wherein microbiome and the central nervous system crosstalk via endocrine, immune, and neural signaling pathways − in various aspects of host health and diseases [19, 20]. Recent studies by others and us have reported an altered gut microbiome in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia and AD [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28] as well as in multiple AD animal models [29], [30], [31], [32]. These evidences suggest that the gut microbiome is linked with host neurological function via gut– microbiome–brain axis [33]. However, whether and how the gut microbiome impacts host cognitive function remain unclear.",2e8d86ad-421d-4460-a0d6-af4bf1472986
25,methods25," Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), a pro-inflammatory component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, has been detected in the brain of AD patients and is speculated to be able to induce systemic inflammation and amyloid accumulation thereby leading to amyloid deposition [34, 35]. In addition, aberrations in the functional pathways comprising circulation, neuroendocrine, neural, and neuro-immune signaling pathways through which the gut microbes and the brain cross-talk with each other are hypothesized as a link between the gut microbiome and host cognitive functions [36], however, the mechanisms are not defined. Hence, investigation of the gut microbiome in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may prove to be important in identifying previously unknown risk factors during early stages of AD, and thus can be targeted to prevent the AD progression.",63fecd86-ac4b-4161-a959-c3d70a19a870
26,methods26,"  Multiple failures of clinical trials for AD treatments focused on single targets indicate that along with complex nature of the AD, the strategies targeting pleotropic effects may be more effective in preventing and ameliorating the AD pathology. For example, the lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise are only effective strategies currently known to reduce the risk of AD, and both of these are superlative modulators of gut microbiome [22] and hence may prove to be key public health preventative approaches. Diet is one of the most prominent modulator of the gut microbiome and is known to prevent aging-related microbiome alterations [37].",dbda27ab-1bf3-4fec-9317-8894fc8604e5
27,methods27," Studies using animal models of aging have reported that a calorie-restricted low-carb diet without malnutrition promotes healthy aging [38], stimulates neuroprotective signatures [39], prevents aging-related transcriptional changes in the hippocampus [39], prevents accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque by modulating the expression of Aβ precursor protein [40], and also modulates the microbiome by fostering specific gut microbes associated with healthy aging [41]. Cerebral amyloidosis and severe tauopathy in brain are crucial pathological characteristics of AD. Despite emerging evidence linking gut microbiome with AD, the association between specific dietary patterns, gut microbes, and AD pathophysiology remains unclear.",96a5ab02-31ce-46c7-9dcd-109ca7610c69
28,methods28," Recently, in a study on older adults clinically diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) and their cognitively normal (CN) counterparts, we reported that a modified Mediterranean-style ketogenic diet (modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD)) is well tolerated with good compliance in these older adults at risk for AD [42]. In addition, we also reported that, in comparison to a six-week intervention of a control low-fat American Heart Association Diet (American Heart Association Diet (AHAD)), an equivalent intervention of modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) (a) improves the profiles of Alzheimer's biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)), (b) increases the cerebral perfusion and cerebral ketone body uptake and metabolism, and (c) improves metabolic health in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).",341b9463-8026-4ae7-b353-6d948fd6f9d0
29,methods29," Concurrently, we also reported specific gut bacterial microbiome signatures in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [24], wherein the modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) was found to modulate the gut bacterial population in association with improved profiles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of AD in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, recent evidence indicates that the diet-microbe association in the otherwise complex human intestinal microbial ecosystem may not exclusively be limited to a particular microbial kingdom (bacteriome) but instead might comprise inter-relationships with other microbes such as fungi (mycobiome) that play a shared role in various milieus of host health and disease. However, whether and how the gut mycobiome differ between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus healthy counterparts and whether and how specific dietary interventions affect these mycobiome signatures remain unknown.",09a91fa4-cf28-46fe-9ffb-eeb90df5b836
30,methods30," Given the high prevalence of fungi in our environment, it is unsurprising that fungi also constitute part of the human microbiome. Although the mycobiome represent a relatively small fraction of the human microbiome, recent studies have begun to examine their role in human health and disease. Studies have implicated the role of gut fungi in several human diseases including inflammatory bowel disease [43, 44], enterocolitis [45, 46], colorectal cancers [47], graft versus host disease [48], alcoholic liver disease [49], asthma [50] and hepatitis B virus infections [51]. In addition, several studies have reported a dysbiotic gut fungal microbiota in patients with Autism spectrum disorder [52], [53], [54]. These studies underline the need to examine the gut mycobiome more broadly, which would help in identifying potential disease-contributing fungal clades while uncovering fungal-bacterial relationships important for host health.",b0ff6ae7-eb32-4974-966c-455953f59396

Similarly, Wallemia correlates significantly negatively with total tau and tau-p181 in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) but not in CN subjects. Debaryomyces correlates negatively with Aβ−40 while Mrakia correlates positively with Aβ−40 in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) but not in CN subjects.

In addition, we reported that these patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) harbor specific gut bacterial signatures that correlate with improved cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarker profiles during modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) intervention [24].

Although the overall β-diversity does not differ remarkably between the two groups, we find slightly lower Shannon index (a marker of species evenness) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus CN subjects (Fig. 1a,b).

60,discussion6," In addition, these analyses suggest that the inter-kingdom ecological co-occurrence relationships may be vital for gut homeostasis in a healthy state whereas gut dysbiosis in a disease state might induce altered bacterial-fungal ecological interactions, which might play a role in AD pathogenesis. In addition to our previous report showing specific gut bacterial signatures in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [24], several other recent studies have also reported an altered gut microbiome in patients with AD [21], [22], [23] as well as in several AD animal models [29], [30], [31], [32]. Given that this altered microbiome composition also indicates altered microbiome function, it may be speculated that these specific mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-specific bacterial and fungal signatures could be playing a contributing role in AD pathogenesis plausibly via altered microbiome metabolism or by modulating intestinal and systemic immunity.",7a8b484a-d7d1-4ccc-938e-df79336db7c5
61,discussion7," In addition, aging as such also involves a reduced gut barrier function, increased gut barrier permeability [65] and dysregulated mucosal surfaces [66], which together with an altered microbiome signatures could also contribute to AD pathology.  In line with our previous report on modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD)-modulated bacterial microbiome [24], the six-week intervention of modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) induces a more prominent effect on the mycobiome as compared to American Heart Association Diet (AHAD) (Fig. 2a,c). The modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD)-induced increase in fungal alpha-diversity in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) but not in their CN counterparts (Fig. 2b) is interesting particularly because the alpha-diversity was lower in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at the baseline and was increased (restored) by modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) in these patients (Fig. 1b).",0cf4ae58-3708-45c7-8de1-37984e5071f2

Interestingly, compared to CN subjects on modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD), the patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) also demonstrate relatively denser array of correlation network (Fig. 5a), suggesting that modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) modulated the fungal and bacterial microbiome and their co-occurrence more prominently in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus CN subjects.",77a3a282-e65c-47ad-95a3-18eabc79bc82
64,discussion10," However, it is worth mentioning here that which of these gut fungi truly colonized the gut of these subjects versus transient fungi that came through diets remains unknown. Many fungal taxa commonly detected in human gut such as Penicillium, Agaricus, Botrytis and Fusarium are unlikely to remain viable in the gut due to hostile growth conditions or ecological niches and hence are believed to be frequently and transiently introduced through the diet [67, 68]. Nevertheless, the inability to stably colonize the gut may not preclude these fungi from exerting a biological effect on the host or interacting with the gut bacteria. However, this remains one of the limitations of the current study and many other studies using culture-independent methods that the resultant data, despite being high-throughput and wide-ranging in coverage, are unable to distinguish between true colonizers of the gut versus transient members [69, 70].",81cf74ec-3d34-4baa-9401-4292f34d9e7b

However, the role of diet as a direct source of fungi in the human gut remain underexplored. Further studies from a microbial ecology perspective would be indispensable to understand the indigenous versus transient arrays of potential fungal taxa in the human intestinal tract, particularly of those taxa that have sustained influence on host health.  Fungi and bacteria commensally cohabit the human gut and, intrinsically, their mode of interaction in the gut may be altered in a disease state. In this context, our co-occurrence analyses suggest that a complex ecological co-regulation network between fungi and bacteria exists in a healthy gut, which is perturbed in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).",eca1e698-bba1-4d16-a56c-647bcf70c553

Fig. 2), suggesting that the role of fungi in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) might be interdependent. In addition, an altered bacterial composition in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as reported in our previous study [24], may lead to different organic environment in the gut, which provides a favorable condition for specific fungal taxa while antagonizing others. A classic example of this is the significant reduction seen in here in the proportion of genus Candida in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) during modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) intervention (Fig. 3c).",6520913b-a44b-4255-98ea-6dda9ca6fde2
67,discussion13," The genus Candida comprises many opportunistic species implicated in various gut-related diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gut inflammation [78]. In addition, there have been a few reports of altered gut fungal community characterized by higher incidences of Candida in patients with Autism spectrum disorder [53, 54]. In this context, reduced Candida carriage in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) might reflect another positive outcome of the modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) intervention. Notably, we find a significantly negative correlation of Candida with short-chain fatty acid butyrate (Fig. 5a), a beneficial gut bacterial metabolite which was found to be increased by modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) in these patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [24]. One of the ways gut bacteriome keep mycobiome in check is through the production of wide range of small molecules such as SCFAs (e.g.",bcb43c73-2e02-493d-9231-ae4c42d7320c
68,discussion14,", butyrate), which have inhibitory effects against the growth of pathobionts including Candida albicans [79, 80]. Together, these data suggest that the modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) positively modulates the gut microbiome as well as the bacterial metabolites arrays, which in turn may check the overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens such as Candida. It should also be an interesting subject for further studies to explore the use of these bacterial metabolites such as butyrate as an alternative to anti-fungal drugs to prevent intestinal colonization of fungal pathobionts, because anti-fungal agents otherwise skews the entire gut mycobiome community while also selecting for drug-resistant strains.

Butyrate, which was increased by modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) in these patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [24], is also known to reduce Th17 cells [82, 83]. Together, these findings suggest that modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD)-induced modulation of host gut microbiome and metabolites may have downstream consequences for host immune or even neuroinflammatory health particularly in neurological disorders including AD.",7fe14933-4675-4788-9de1-b98b84853e23
70,discussion16," Given the emerging role of neuroinflammation in dementia, cognition and AD [84], [85], [86], these microbial and metabolite modulations may be a potential mechanism contributing to the efficacy of modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) in improving cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers in these patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [24, 42]. Diet-based and microbiome-targeted approaches to prevent or treat AD may have potential translational efficacy.

The present study has several limitations. This was a pilot-scale small sample size observational study and hence the findings may limit generalizable extrapolation and may include confounding biases of certain subgroup factors such as lifestyle, gender, ethnicity and others that might also contribute to distinct mycobiome signatures in the gut. In addition, there might be some carry-over effects of dietary interventions and influences because of the crossover study design. It also remains unclear how these associations between gut fungi, bacteria and AD's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profiles relate to AD pathogenesis and whether these associations are cause or consequence of the disease.",b557c0f4-bce0-4f9f-a497-2ab855d12e47

Covering microbiome alterations at AD stages even earlier than those in the present study cohort might provide further understanding of such causality. In addition, it might also be possible that the alterations in the brain during AD progression could have influenced the microbiome. Although our study finds association of diet-microbiome interaction with AD's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), further broader and more inclusive investigations will be required to decipher potential mechanisms and translational implications of these associations with reference to AD pathogenesis and human aging.",034693df-91db-40f0-a462-d2a53327cbc5
73,discussion19," Such studies would explicate novel microbiome-based prognostic markers of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD and may lead to discovering novel probiotic microorganisms with therapeutic potential for AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in future. In summary, our data corroborate the emerging concept of implication of gut-microbiome-brain axis in host neurodegenerative health while fortifying the existing evidence with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-specific mycobiome signatures and bacterial-fungal ecologic interactions in context to specific dietary interventions. The findings should facilitate further studies in exploring and developing novel therapeutics aimed at remodeling the gut microbiome functionality to prevent/ ameliorate neurodegenerative disorders including dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD in high-risk subjects.
