0,discussion0," SCN4A pathogenic loss of function (LOF) variants are extremely rare. Initially linked to CMS16 (2–4), a severe, sometimes even lethal myopathic phenotype has been described more recently (5, 6). The phenotype associated with these autosomal recessive variants is characterized by severe muscular insufficiency most often starting at birth, sometimes with clinical improvement over time (Supplementary Table S1). This phenotypic spectrum is possibly related to the degree of functional impairment of the SCN4A protein (5, 6). Complete loss of function (LOF) in both alleles is likely not compatible with life and was associated with still birth and congenital anomalies (6).  We report here a patient with a severe autosomal recessive CMS/myopathy phenotype of neonatal onset, implicating compound heterozygosity for the loss of function (LOF) variant SCN4A:p.(R1454W) and a novel variant SCN4A:p.(N1205K) in SCN4A-related disease. The previously reported patient with homozygous SCN4A:p.",42d2b519-cc13-466a-bc5b-03103e7c6b34
1,discussion1,"(R1454W) alleles suffered from permanent but fluctuating muscle weakness with acute and reversible attacks up to full paralysis, however was able to walk (4), in contrast to our patient, emphasizing the potential impact of the newly identified variant SCN4A:p.(N1205K) in causing a more severe phenotype.  Deciphering the pathogenicity of new ion channel variants is not always straight forward in the absence of functional data. True disease-causing alleles in SCNxA genes may be difficult to set apart from incidental findings. For instance, the significance of the paralogous variant SCN10A:p.(N1328K) is uncertain since the association between SCN10A and Brugada syndrome is not well established. Moreover, complex presentations may be due to multiple co-existing variants in several genes. For example, one of the patients with the paralogous variant SCN5A:p.",688eb31a-a48e-41c7-854d-c6330df2cc88
2,discussion2,"(N1380K) diagnosed with Brugada syndrome additionally suffered of myotonic dystrophy type 2 (genetically confirmed) with symptoms of abnormal fatigue and hand myotonia (15).  Whereas the pathogenicity of SCN4A:p.(R1454W) was functionally validated, SCN4A:p.(N1205K) was initially considered of uncertain significance. We therefore leveraged the conservation of the mutated amino acid across the human SCNxA family of genes to clarify the effects of SCN4A:p.(N1205K).  All nine SCNxA family members have a mutual evolutionary descent and a highly conserved amino acid sequence structure, allowing fairly accurate predictions of functional effects. Paralog-based in silico predictions suggested a loss of function (LOF) effect with high probability (12).",d1677e36-696f-4daa-9302-7ba2647ccfc0
3,discussion3," Additionally, a recent systematic analysis of functionally assessed variants in the nine voltage-gated sodium channel genes (11) showed that variants across all four S5–6 reentrant loop regions were predominantly (in 91% of cases) associated with loss of function (LOF). Furthermore, regardless of which one of the SCNxA family member was impaired, paralogous variants in this region showed similar functional consequences in 92% of cases (11). The authors highlight that biophysical characterization of variants in one SCNxA gene family member is useful to estimate channel function in other SCNxA gene family members when experimental data is unavailable (11).  In addition to its location in the S5-6 reentrant pore loop, the phenotypes of individuals with paralogous variants in SCN1A (developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), FS) and SCN5A (Brugada syndrome) and the functional data from SCN5A (markedly reduced current density) indicate that SCN4A:p.",f28c69c7-b69a-4af3-8716-86048d43764c
4,discussion4,"(N1205K) is a likely loss of function (LOF) variant. Although all of the above-described paralogous variants are reported in heterozygous state, this is consistent with the modes of inheritance of their respective disorders. For recessive presentations caused by NaV1.4 loss of function (LOF), haploinsufficiency is tolerated as it preserves some function and both parents of our proband were healthy. In contrast, for NaV1.5 in the heart and NaV1.1 in the brain, haploinsufficiency is not well tolerated (21).  Recurrence and functional evidence of altered protein function are strong pathogenicity criteria (PS1 & PS3) according to the ACMG/AMP framework, albeit when established in the same gene. As discussed above, the concordance in functional effects among paralogous variants exceeds 90%.",e31fd54d-ce2e-4012-8276-26a779b6ce25
5,discussion5," We therefore incorporated these data in our classification in a conservative manner; the criteria PS1 & PS3 were downgraded from strong to supporting evidence of pathogenicity with respect to lack of data from the same gene, which we consider an important limitation of this report.  Patients with CMS/myopathy syndrome due to variants in SCNA4 show poor response to pyridostigmine but may benefit from treatment with acetazolamide (Supplementary Table S1). This was also observed in our patient. Salbutamol as a therapeutic attempt should be considered in these patients as well, since the patient reported by Elia et al. (5) and our patient showed some benefit in muscular strength. Reduced complex I deficiency seen in our patient most likely represents a secondary phenomenon as has been described with this disease (6) and other neuromuscular disorders (22, 23).",71136485-c77b-4050-a06a-a6f3b194aef3
6,discussion6,"  Our patient was born at a time of restricted possibilities regarding genetic testing and was considered to suffer from mitochondrial myopathy, whereas whole exome sequencing (WES) performed more than 10 years later revealed the correct diagnosis of a SCN4A-related myopathy caused by loss of function (LOF) NaV1.4 variants, which facilitated informed counseling about the cause of the disease and offered insights into new treatment options with some (although limited) benefit. We therefore highlight the importance of genetic testing in patients with neuromuscular disorders in all age groups in order to provide better clinical care and consequently improve the quality of life for patients.
