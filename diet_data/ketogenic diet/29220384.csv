0,introduction0,"Epilepsy is a disabling and common neurological disease, which can be controlled successfully in most patients with one or more antiepileptic drugs. Approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy have refractory epilepsy, that is, have a failure of adequate trials of two tolerated, appropriately chosen and used antiepileptic drug schedules to achieve sustained relief of seizures . Some of these patients are not surgery candidates, so it is necessary to search for alternative treatments for epilepsy such as palliative surgery, neuromodulation, and a ketogenic diet (KD).  The classic ketogenic diet (classic ketogenic diet (CKD)) consists of a high-fat and low-protein and carbohydrate diet, with restricted calories and fluids. The diet mimics the fasting state, altering the metabolism to use fats as a primary fuel source; catabolism of fatty acids in the liver produces ketone bodies (KB), which induces urinary ketosis (Rho, 2017).",5a52944b-2d48-4c13-85a2-198f6b489401
1,introduction1,"  Recent studies have found a significantly positive outcome with the use of the KD for treatment of refractory epilepsy in children and adults (Barborka, 1928; Neal et al., 2008; Kverneland et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018).  Regardless of the efficacy of the KD, most patients discontinue the diet because of its unpalatable and restrictive features. In the last 20 years, new variants of the KD diet have emerged, including the Modified Atkins diet (Modified Atkins Diet (MAD)), a low-glycemic-index diet, which although it has a high fat content, allows more protein and does not restrict calories and fluids. Several studies have shown that the new variants of the KD have a similar efficacy to the classic ketogenic diet (CKD) (Kossoff et al., 2006; Tonekaboni et al., 2010; Coppola et al., 2011; Miranda et al., 2012; El-Rashidy et al., 2013).",57258c83-8580-492e-8206-ac8039cbd63c
2,introduction2," As presently understood, the KD is involved in multiple mechanisms responsible for biochemical alterations, including cellular substrates and mediators responsible for neuronal hyperexcitability. However, it is not yet known with certainty whether the success of the KD is due to a single or several mechanisms (Bough and Rho, 2007; Lutas and Yellen, 2013; Rho, 2017; Youngson et al., 2017).  Because epilepsy is a metabolic disease , interest in studies of alterations of metabolism by anticonvulsants such as the KD has increased, as has their importance for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. This contribution reviews the use and effects of the KD and its variants for the treatment of adults and children with intractable epilepsy.  Ketogenic Diet Past to Present Dietary treatments for diseases have probably been used for over 2000 years (Yuen and Sander, 2014). Fasting is the only therapeutic measure against epilepsy recorded in the Hippocratic collection.",311335a7-dc75-4f20-bb42-75326437a9d8
3,introduction3," Two Parisian physicians, G Guelpa, and A Marie, recorded the first modern use of starvation as a treatment for epilepsy in 1911 (Wheless, 2008). The modern use of this form of therapy began in the early 1920s (Lima et al., 2014; Yuen and Sander, 2014), when Drs. Stanley Cobb and W.G. Lennox of Harvard at Harvard Medical School observed the effects of starvation as a treatment for epilepsy, noting that seizure improvement typically occurred after 2–3 days (Wheless, 2008). In the same period, Dr. Russel M. Wilder a physician at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, suggested that a specific diet could produce similar benefits to fasting, and proposed a diet that produced ketonemia. He studied a series of patients with epilepsy and demonstrated a result equivalent to fasting and that was maintained for a much longer period. This new concept of diet was designated the “KD.” Peterman, also at the Mayo Clinic, described a composition of the KD similar to that used today (Wilder, 1921).",cbdac43b-208a-4569-b31a-3f813a186907
4,introduction4,"  In 1970, Robert C. Atkins developed a weight-loss diet that restricted the intake of carbohydrates (Sharma and Jain, 2014), and this diet was later evaluated for seizure treatment. The first patient was a 7-year-old girl with intractable epilepsy due to a left parietal cortical dysplasia, who used the Atkins diet for a week in order to acclimate to the classic ketogenic diet (CKD). After 3 days, her seizures stopped, and she remained seizure-free for 3 years with continued dietary treatment . In 2006, this diet was first formally referred to as the “Modified Atkins Diet (MAD)” to distinguish it from the Atkins diet . The Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) has three significant differences from the first version: the induction phase of limiting carbohydrates is maintained indefinitely; high-fat foods are not only allowed, but encouraged; and the primary goal of the diet is seizure control (Atkins, 2002; Sharma and Jain, 2014).",2a94cd57-95a4-42a8-81cf-b5cfd5384d2c
5,introduction5,"  Nowadays, despite the new generation of anti-epileptic drugs, 35% of patients remain refractory. Interest in dietary therapy continues as a means of treatment for this group, even more with advances in knowledge regarding the association of gut microbiota and neurological diseases.  Classic Ketogenic Diet What Is Classic KD? The classic ketogenic diet (CKD) is rich in lipids (90%) and low in carbohydrates and protein, in order to produce ketosis, and simulates a starvation state. It is a rigid diet, mathematically and individually calculated, and medically monitored . It must also provide adequate vitamins and minerals. The shift in the energy metabolism from glycolytic energy production to energy generation through oxidative phosphorylation (fatty acid b-oxidation and ketone-body production) is part of the anticonvulsant mechanism of the KD (Bough, 2008; Liu et al., 2018). This is discussed in more detail in the section on the mechanism of action.",07af3e0e-8dc7-488c-9401-00a88339324b
6,introduction6,"  Indication and Contraindications Traditionally, the KD has been considered the gold standard for the treatment of metabolic diseases such as Glucose Transporter Protein 1 (GLUT-1) deficiency syndrome and Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Deficiency. At present, the KD has been consistently reported as more beneficial, with more than 70% patients showing positive responses, as opposed to the average 50% response in several conditions such as infantile spasms (Table 1). The KD has also been used in other conditions with less evidence, but possible benefits (Table 2) . Additionally, the KD is an important alternative treatment for patients with refractory epilepsy (Rho, 2017) that are not surgery candidates.

12,introduction12," It is also important to review the medications and change from oral solutions (carbohydrate content) to tablets . The KD counseling, evaluation and follow-up should be done by a multidisciplinary team. A pediatric neurologist or neurologist and a nutritionist are the minimum team requirements.

14,introduction14," aif applicable; bif diagnosis unclear.Diet Initiation The goal is to reach a ratio of four portion of fat to one portion of protein plus carbohydrate, described as “4:1.” To achieve this level, one of two approaches, with or without fasting, may be used. In the former approach, the patient must be hospitalized for 12–48 h, or when ketones are present in the urine (Rubenstein, 2008), to prevent the development of hypoglycemia and dehydration. This method tends to accelerate the development of ketosis although it can generate more stress on the patient . When ketosis is reached, the meals are calculated to maintain a constant KD ratio, while calories are added until full-calorie meals are tolerated . The latter approach requires no hospitalization and the KD ratio increases weekly, from 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 to 4:1 .",55b3f13b-89fd-46f3-8d46-0ddd905c0ee0
15,introduction15," Most of the literature suggests that there is no significant difference between the two approaches in terms of the time needed to reach ketosis and the occurrence of hypoglycemia , so nowadays patients tend to not fast.  Taking into account that the KD provides only small amounts of fruits, vegetables, grains, milk and cheese, supplementation is essential. Low-carbohydrate multivitamin and mineral supplements should be taken daily.  Follow Up Patients on the KD should be seen regularly every 3 months, and the family should be able to easily contact the diet team to resolve possible doubts and discuss adverse effects. In each evaluation, the seizure dairy and the child’s cognitive development and behavior should be observed (Auvin and Nabbout, 2011). It has been noted that it is possible to improve the cognitive development and behavior even without a change in the seizure frequency.",6ae2fd36-7fba-40e9-a04c-8d52a8b3007e
16,introduction16," Although some authors have reported no relationship between the efficacy and the level of ketosis, it is still recommended to measure the urine ketosis several times a week .  For efficacy, the KD requires a period of at least 3 months from the time that the patient reaches ketosis, so it is important to encourage the patient and the family to continue with the diet for this period without changing the medication.  Adverse Effects Because KD is not a physiological diet, it is necessary to recognize and closely manage AE . Acute AE include dehydration, hypoglycemia, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, most of the side effects involve weight loss, high levels of low-density lipoprotein, and elevated total cholesterol . Other important AE are gastrointestinal symptoms, which include constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.",55811a66-1e56-4958-a77f-bb2b7569a74e
17,introduction17,"  The family should also be informed about how to recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia and be advised to administer a small amount of juice or other forms of dextrose . Nephrolithiasis may also develop, and an abdominal ultrasonography should be requested.  Mechanism of Action The understanding of the mechanisms of action of KD is incomplete; however, some theories have been advanced about how it modifies the neuronal metabolism and excitability in order to reduce the seizure frequency. Possibly, the real mechanism of reduction of cortical hyperexcitability involves multiple factors. Some of the systems involved in seizure reduction are related to metabolic changes in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)), including a decrease in glucose levels and an increase in KB. The mitochondria function and energy reserve may also play a role in the KD mechanisms, resulting in synapse stabilization and excitatory decrease.",d8fca15b-be8c-45d3-a74e-1b34ec31722d
18,introduction18,"  Ketone Bodies: Anticonvulsant Effects Ketone bodies, acetoacetate, and β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), are byproducts of fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix of the hepatocytes. There are many theories about the role of KB, but the existence of an anticonvulsant effect is controversial. Some authors have found no relationship between KB and synaptic transmission and seizure control.  Experimental studies in an animal model showed that in rats exposed to KD there was no change in synaptic plasticity, using paired-pulse modulation and long-term potentiation . Similarly, Likhodii et al. (2003) did not detect any anticonvulsant effects in either ketone body . In spontaneously epileptic Kcna1-null mice, KB supplementation resulted in attenuation of electrographic seizure-like events . These authors also observed an inhibitory effect of KB on mitochondrial permeability transition related to apoptotic and necrotic death.",87d5149f-76cb-4480-a964-9ac3550853fb
19,introduction19," Moreover, in experimental models, acetoacetate exerted a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant effect . In another study, Rho (2017) described a relationship among KB, neurotransmitter release and ATP-sensitive potassium channels (Rho, 2017). Similarly, to these studies, injection of KB led to the reduction of seizure susceptibility . Ma et al. (2007) found a decrease of the spontaneous firing rate in sections of mouse tissue, which was eliminated in the absence of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP). In addition, KB can exert a direct inhibitory effect on the vesicular glutamate transport . It is possible that these divergent results are related to the different concentrations of KB used in these studies and the diverse seizure thresholds of the animal models. These conflicting results can be also explained by differences in diet composition.",772a3132-7427-412e-875e-443986061f27
20,introduction20,"  Neuronal Metabolism and Synaptic Function Another hypothesis regarding the function of the KD is related to changes in neuronal metabolism, mitochondrial function and energy reserve, and the environment. In normal conditions, the usual substrate for the neurons is glucose. To facilitate its diffusion through the brain-blood barrier, glucose transports are present in the brain capillary endothelial layer . The glucose metabolism produces the rapidly available energy that is necessary for seizure activity. Therefore, in patients on the KD, the blood glucose energy levels are low, and the brain begins to use KB for energy. This anaerobic metabolism slows the energy availability, which reduces seizures. The anticonvulsant propriety of a decrease in glucose metabolism has been shown in experimental models in which the administration of 2-Deoxy-D-glucose elevates the seizure threshold (Garriga-Canut et al., 2006).",647aa4a5-6b39-4828-b7ad-f113322f3dee
21,introduction21," The anticonvulsant effect of the KD can be quickly reversed after glucose infusion (Huttenlocher, 1976). Based on these data, we can postulate the influences not only of the KB, as discussed above, but also the reduction in glucose levels as a mechanism of action of the KD.  Chronic ketosis may play a role in the KD anticonvulsant properties, since it has been shown that chronic ketosis elevates the brain energy reserve via stabilization and reduction of excitability of synapses . The energy reserve is directly associated with mitochondria, which is an important element to consider in the antiepileptic effect of KD. Bough et al. (2006) demonstrated an increase in mitochondria biogenesis in an experimental model of rats fed with KD, indicating an increase in the energy stores . The increase in mitochondrial metabolism leads to an increase in ATP production, which activates KATP, in turn attenuating neuronal excitability.",32f425cd-46e3-48cb-adff-82e567d9d08f
22,introduction22," This activation may be associated with adenosine A1 receptors  and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)B receptors (Mironov and Richter, 2000).  In this process, we can postulate that modifications of the metabolism are associated with an increase of ATP, and improve mitochondrial capacity and cell energy, with an increase in metabolic resilience.  Neurotransmitter Function The KD-induced synaptic stabilization is additionally related to changes in critical amino acids as a result of ketone metabolism. It has been proposed that KD interferes with the concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter. There is evidence in clinical practice of increased gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients on the KD diet . The decrease in aspartate levels promoted by KB lead to the synthesis of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA).",0021c0d8-f28f-40f6-8a66-e97b41037bd3
23,introduction23," This occurs because of the inhibitory effect of aspartate on glutamate decarboxylase and the facilitation of the conversation of glutamate to glutamine in the astrocytes . Not only can gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) be increased, but also other neurotransmitters such as adenosine A1 can be implicated in the anti-seizure effect of the KD . However, more evidence is needed.  Gut Microbiota, Inflammation, and Genetic The role of gut microbiota has recently been studied for its effect on several diseases, especially those with some inflammatory involvement. Several metabolic pathways are known to be modulated by the gut microbiota. Olson et al. (2018) demonstrated the impact of gut microbiota on the anti-seizure effect of KD. She found that KD modifies the gut microbiota, with a decrease in alpha-diversity and increases in the putatively beneficial bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila and Parabacteroides spp.",c0e619c1-7664-4dd5-bb4f-a5dcfdc57809
24,introduction24," This microbiota transformation leads to changes in the colonic luminal metabolome, with a decrease in gamma-glutamyl amino acids. This increases the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)/glutamate content in the brain by decreasing gamma-glutamyl amino acids in the blood . In an acute electroshock model, it is reported that KD confers protection against seizures. Moreover, KD decreases the frequency of spontaneous seizures in Kcna1 knockout mice . In summary, changes in the gut microbiota seem to be important for the KD-mediated seizure protection.  The role of inflammatory cytokines in epilepsy is well known, and there is evidence that KD also interferes with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Dupuis et al. (2015) showed a peripheral and brain reduction of interleukin 1β and other pro-inflammatory cytokines in rats treated with KD in the LPS model.  Notably, there is a relationship between metabolic and epigenetic modifications. Shimazu et al.",20b5e4b5-faa4-45ae-a4f5-6cf7a192691c
25,introduction25," (2013) observed that βOHB inhibits class I histone deacetylases. During the KD, the elevation of βOHB causes changes in large-scale gene transcription but particularly those linked to oxidative-stress resistance factors. This result emphasizes that the KD has a potential role as a disease-modifying treatment in epilepsy.  In conclusion, all the mechanisms described above lead to systemic modifications and a dynamic metabolic homeostasis, in which the interplay among KB, glucose levels, mitochondrial function, synaptic neurotransmitters, and channel modifications can lead to changes in the seizure threshold and hyperexcitability. These changes contribute to the final antiseizure mechanism of KD.  Multiple mechanisms of action may explain why the modification of the KD can be effective even without ketosis.",d746b9c8-4f7b-494f-839c-735bd108ce81
26,introduction26," Importantly, the KD systemic action can have a broad spectrum of effects that may be beneficial in the treatment of different types of epilepsy and associated comorbidities such as cognition impairment, psychiatric disturbance, and sudden unexplained death.  Modified Atkins Diet in Patients With Refractory Epilepsy Definition and Diet Composition The Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) aims to provide increased flexibility and palatability, with a 1:1 ratio of fat to carbohydrates and protein, and contains around 65% fat, 25% protein, and 10% carbohydrate . Fat is encouraged and the carbohydrate intake is limited to 10–20 g/day in children and 15–20 g/day in adults (Kossoff, 2004; Kossoff and Dorward, 2008). Because of carbohydrate restriction, the Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) can also produce urinary ketones .",6d3d1c44-2064-4a0a-b969-cf63735c2e87
27,introduction27," The Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) does not require weighing food on a gram scale, or restriction of calories, protein or liquids, and may be a good option for patients who are unable to tolerate a more restrictive diet such as the classical ketogenic diet (KD) . Low-carbohydrate multivitamin and calcium carbonate supplementation is recommended in the Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) .  Efficacy in Children Several studies have shown that the Modified Atkins Diet (MAD), besides being more palatable, is as effective as the KD in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy in children . A study performed using 20 children receiving 10 g of carbohydrates daily showed that 65% of the children had a >50% seizure reduction, 35% of the children had >90% improvement, and four children were seizure-free at 6 months .",6adc2ece-f0e6-4b36-a274-2e42822ad13f
28,introduction28," In a study in South Korea, 36% of 14 children treated with the Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) showed improvement of >50% in seizures and 12% were seizure-free .

A retrospective study showed >50% of seizure reduction in 65% of the 10 children who remained on the diet for up to 6 months, and 20% of them were seizure-free .  Treatment with Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) was shown to be more effective in seizure control when the Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) was started with lower carbohydrate limits .",0f701ee7-8e8d-422a-8a85-dc4d9fcada34
29,introduction29," In a randomized study with 20 children with drug-resistant epilepsy, 60% of them showed fewer seizures in the first 3 months on the Modified Atkins Diet (MAD), with 10 g/day of carbohydrate intake against 10% of reduction with 20 g/day (p = 0.03). In the same study, after 3 months, an increase in carbohydrate intake to 20 g/day, maintained seizure control and improved tolerability, suggesting that a lower carbohydrate limit is important only in the first 3 months (Kossoff et al., 2007; Kossoff and Dorward, 2008).  Efficacy in Adolescents and Adults The efficacy of the Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) is also proven for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy in adults and adolescents. In this patient group, carbohydrate intake is generally around 15–20 g/day and the rates of seizure reduction and adherence are lower compared to those of the child population (Kossoff et al., 2008; Zare et al., 2017; Payne et al., 2018).",9463b16c-868a-4804-aaab-9187136bec9c

The rate of abandonment of the diet varied between 12.5 and 82% of the patients .

31,introduction31,"  Low Glycemic Index Diet in Patients With Refractory Epilepsy Definition and Diet Composition The use of the low glycemic index treatment (LGIT) in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy was initially reported in 2005 by Pfeifer and Thiele (2005). This alternative diet treatment is based on a ratio 0.6:1 of fat to carbohydrates and protein, containing 60% fats, 30% protein, and 10% carbohydrates with a low glycemic index (GI) (GI<50) (Pfeifer and Thiele, 2005; Payne et al., 2018). The GI measures the tendency of a food to raise the blood glucose levels, compared to an equivalent amount of the reference carbohydrate, usually glucose . Compared to classic the KD, the low glycemic index treatment (LGIT) produces a smaller increase in ketone body levels, but has comparable efficacy, better tolerability and easier implementation (Pfeifer and Thiele, 2005; Pfeifer et al., 2008).",088ef1ef-9a30-4532-a51d-6789ec7d7c07
32,introduction32,"  Efficacy The low glycemic index treatment (LGIT) has proven to be effective in the treatment of focal and generalized epilepsies, with a reduction in seizure frequency occurring at 3–14 months and seizure control continuing for at least 1 year after the end of treatment (Pfeifer et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2017; Rezaei et al., 2018). Pfeifer and Thiele (2005) reported the use of low glycemic index treatment (LGIT) in 20 drug-resistant epilepsy patients aged 5 to 34 years. After an average of 20 weeks of treatment, 50% of the patients had a >90% reduction in seizures. Coppola et al. (2011) studied 15 children, adolescents and young adults with refractory epileptic encephalopathies treated with low glycemic index treatment (LGIT). After 12 months they found 75–90% seizure reduction in 6 patients (40%), 50% reduction in 2 patients (13.3%), and the seizure frequency unchanged in 7 (46.7%).

However, according to a recent systematic review, the positive results for low glycemic index treatment (LGIT) efficacy in epileptic patients are doubtful because of the low number of high-quality studies.
