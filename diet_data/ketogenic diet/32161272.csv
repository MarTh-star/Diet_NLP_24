0,introduction0," Ketogenic diet consists of high fat, low carbohydrates with a moderate protein intake. It is responsible for the production of ketone bodies as an alternate source of energy in humans, a state termed as ketosis. The diet has been modified over the years, with modified Atkin’s diet and the incorporation of medium-chained triglycerides (medium chained triglycerides (MCT)). The medium chained triglycerides (MCT)s can be derived from natural sources such as coconut oil and palm tree oil and are composed of octanoic acid (Caprylic acid: 65–75%), decanoic acid (Capric acid: 25–35%), hexanoic acid (Caproic acid: 1–2%) and dodecanoic acid (Lauric acid: 1–2%)1. Commercially available over-the-counter medium chained triglycerides (MCT) supplements are being manufactured by nutritional companies such as Simyl, Luxura Sciences, Kayos Naturals, Healthvit, Nutiva, Grow Fit, etc., in the form of oils and/or powders.",4f6597ff-6327-4935-82d8-27014cc0bf3b
1,introduction1," The composition of these marketed products includes 60–70% of octanoic acid and 30–40% of decanoic acid, whereby 15–20 g of medium chained triglycerides (MCT) is recommended as amount of daily intake, as per the product labels. Ketogenic diet is clinically approved for the treatment of intractable epilepsy in children and in adults2,3. medium chained triglycerides (MCT) supplemented type of ketogenic diet (medium chained triglycerides (MCT) diet) has also been widely used as a treatment against neurodegenerative disorders with promising results in controlling seizure activity in children with refractory epilepsy4,5. Clinical evidences has shown remarkable seizure reduction in not only children but also in adults4–9 such as the case report of a 43-year old male patient with drug-resistant partial epilepsy after administering medium chained triglycerides (MCT) oil supplements7.",829aca7f-3f8e-44fc-8bfe-be6e54605130
2,introduction2," medium chained triglycerides (MCT) supplemented ketogenic diet has also expressed neuroprotective effects by improving the Alzheimer’s disease assessment score in patients during a ketogenic diet retention and feasibility trial conducted by Matthew K. Taylor and his co-workers10. medium chained triglycerides (MCT) diet has also been researched in other metabolic disorders such as cancer and diabetes, on the basis of their various mechanisms of action11. Commonly, the short term use of the low caloric medium chained triglycerides (MCT) diet is associated with weight loss, fat loss and changes in whole body composition including fat mass and adipose tissue distribution referred from clinical and meta-analysis studies performed12,13.  The mechanism of prevention of neurodegeneration by medium chained triglycerides (MCT) is associated with the production of ketone bodies such as β-hydroxybutyrate (body beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB))11.",f0ec16f7-0d5d-432c-b0c5-2ebe298d0800
3,introduction3," Among medium chained triglycerides (MCT), decanoic acid has exhibited anti-convulsant potential via selective inhibition of glutamatergic AMPA receptors14. Anti-inflammatory action of decanoic acid explored on comparison with lauric acid resulted in inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) signaling15. Decanoic acid also acts an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-PPARγ16. The cause of octanoic acid exhibiting anti-convulsant action remains unknown.  Ketogenic diet, although deemed efficacious, has been associated with low bone mineral density according to numerous clinical findings17,18. Decanoic acid and octanoic acid, major components of medium chained triglycerides (MCT) diet, are classified under saturated fatty acids; in vitro analysis of predominantly used saturated fatty acids in everyday diet such as palmitic acid, stearic acid and lauric acid, suggested osteoclastogenesis and development of osteoarthritis19.",518cc6e8-5cd9-48fc-ab97-e63a1fa4a31f
4,introduction4," However, pre-clinical investigation of decanoic acid on osteoclasts suggested inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa Β ligand (RANKL))-induced osteoclastogenesis20,21. According to these controversial outcomes, there lies a need to investigate the effects of medium chained triglycerides (MCT) diet on bone health. To the best of our knowledge, no study has evaluated the role of individual components of medium chained triglycerides (MCT) ketogenic diet to ascertain effects on bone after in vivo administration. Further, no in vitro or in vivo studies have been performed with octanoic acid.",99ea6097-345e-4f7e-9c3e-d10241de0d19

Alkaline phosphatase is widely considered as the bone formation marker and it was observed to be significantly reduced upon oral administration of octanoic acid (p < 0.001 versus control). Furthermore, there was also a significant difference in the levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), between the octanoic acid treated group and the groups treated with decanoic acid (p < 0.05 vs. DA).

21,discussion0," The consumption of medium chained triglycerides (MCT) has been globally accepted as a dietary treatment against not only refractory epilepsy in children as well as adults but also against a number of other neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic disorders11 in addition to the over the counter use to reduce body weight13. Here, we report for the first time that octanoic acid, one of the major components of medium chained triglycerides (MCT) ketogenic diet, is detrimental to bone and requires caution in patients susceptible to bone depletion. Given the fact that both epilepsy and antiepileptic drug therapy have been linked to deteriorating effects on bone27 and that the ketogenic medium chained triglycerides (MCT) diet is widely consumed, the findings of our study may have significant translational relevance for persons with epilepsy and population in general.",bb6a5287-20e2-43a8-ab91-17efc08d5b9e
22,discussion1,"  We observed that octanoic acid treatment for 30 days reduced the levels of alkaline phosphatase (alkaline phosphatase (ALP)), a marker for bone formation and increased the levels of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (tartarate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)), a bone resorption marker in bones. These findings were further substantiated by micro-architectural analysis of trabecular part of femoral and tibial bones where octanoic acid treated mice elicited remarkable alterations showing maximum deleterious effects in three-dimensional reconstructed images along with the evident reduction in both, bone mineral density and bone mineral content, confirming the adverse effects on bone due to octanoic acid treatment. Therefore, the results obtained in our study provide firm evidence that octanoic acid exhibit detrimental effects on bone mineralization.  On the contrary, decanoic acid illustrated no remarkable effects.",ad052fb0-c505-404b-8e0c-05435aba586c
23,discussion2," The results suggested that the involvement of decanoic acid in degrading bone strength is minimal and could be explained by the results obtained from previous in vitro investigations implemented by Park et al. and Kim et al20,21 where decanoic acid exhibited inhibition against lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS))-induced osteoclastogenesis and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa Β ligand (RANKL))-induced differentiation in mature osteoclasts, respectively. However, no such in vitro data is available for octanoic acid. These findings can also be substantiated with evidence pertaining to greater oxidation of octanoic acid than decanoic acid leading to the accumulation of the latter in the body28, thereby, suggesting the impact of increased production of oxidative metabolites of octanoic acid on bone resorption.",b12820e9-d433-43db-98bf-45424688c472
24,discussion3,"  The ketosis can be induced either naturally by reduction in carbohydrate intake or caloric intake or could be independent of diet simply by administration of medium chained triglycerides. In our study too, the urinary ketone levels were raised only in groups that were administered with medium chained fatty acid- decanoic acid and octanoic acid, for inducing ketosis. While the exact mechanisms behind the bone resorption potential shown by octanoic acid ingestion remains unknown, the role of ketone bodies appears unlikely from our results. Though it has been postulated that the ketone bodies are regulated in osteoclast cells in obesity model induced by high fat diet consumption29, there are investigations that suggest a positive role of the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (body beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB)) on the proliferation of osteoblasts as well as bone growth promoting effects in ovariectomized rats30.",cccc2e31-b57e-4dd1-a3ef-3be8f067d8d8
25,discussion4," In addition, anti-osteoporotic actions of body beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has been reported in mice with degraded bone density due to stimulated microgravity31. These contradictory outcomes resulted in the probability of an alternate mechanism other than the production of ketone bodies, for the negative impact on bone health caused by octanoic acid requiring further investigations. Another point that needs to be reaffirmed is that all animals were fed normal chow diet concurrently with the fatty acid treatment that contains about 50% of carbohydrate that can possibly counteract some ketosis causing bone depletion. Moreover, the effects on urinary ketone body was lowest for octanoic acid treated group. Therefore, our findings suggest that the bone depletion depicted by octanoic acid in our study was not due to ketosis.  Our study has its limitations.",053722da-3602-407e-811f-58a16c06e587
26,discussion5," The information gathered from this study remains partial as only the trabecular region of the bones provided significant data; in order to confirm the bone resorptive potential of octanoic acid, the evaluation of cortical regions of bones is also required. In our study, the analysis of cortical bones boomed no significant result and hence, were inconsequential. However, we believe this was due to the short duration of treatment with medium chained triglycerides (MCT) components and propose further investigation with long term administration of both decanoic acid and octanoic acid to evaluate the effects on cortical bone as well. Furthermore, the impact of physical activity or exercise on bone health while consuming medium chained triglycerides (MCT) ketogenic diet was not partaken into the objectives of this study.",f98a491f-2202-4e90-92b8-49ba00e03cea
27,discussion6," This factor has become crucial after recent findings that suggest short term intake of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet has resulted in impairment of bone health in athletic volunteers32. The outcomes of our study regardless of its limitations, implies the need of clinical investigations to be employed in order to validate the detrimental effects of ketogenic diet including medium chained triglycerides (MCT) diet.  To conclude, we report a significant negative effect on bone by octanoic acid, one of the major components of medium chained triglycerides (MCT) ketogenic diet. We propose an urgent need to investigate the individual components of the diet for potential adverse effects and to modify dietary medium chained triglycerides (MCT) ketogenic diet composition accordingly.",51c308b3-bcb1-4e9f-a098-aab789a9ab5e
