0,methods0,"4.1. Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents The study has been approved by our IRB with waiver of informed consent due to retrospective design. Specific informed consent for the execution of MR examinations was obtained from every patient/next of kin. The study was carried out in agreement with the principles of the Helsinki declaration. This research was approved by the ethical committee of Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital (protocol number 1867/2019).  4.2. Subjects We identified 31 patients treated with classic KD. Each patient followed a diet with a specific KD ratio (ratio of lipids to combined fat and protein), depending on clinical course and seizure response. Out of 31 subjects, 17 KD patients (mean age = 7.3 y, range = 0.4−16 y, 50% female) underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) during their treatment, producing 17 spectra. Additionally, a group of seven age-matched Healthy Controls (HC) (mean age = 9.",a8ada6fc-fb71-4fd1-8f1d-29fa7c149e16
1,methods1,"8, range = 6−17 y, 43% female) was included in the study for comparison. A steady 3HB concentration was assured before and during fasting, soon before and soon after the end of the procedure. Clinical data on patient age, diagnosis, medications, diet duration and seizure occurrence (mean number of seizures per week computed over a period of 4 weeks) were reported in Table 1.  4.3. Data Acquisition Brain MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were acquired on a 3T scanner (Siemens Magnetom Skyra, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 32-channel head-coil. Each participant received a single voxel point resolved magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) sequence PRESS (TR: 1980 ms, TE: 30 ms, FA: 90 degrees, Number of averages: 120), with different sizes of volume of interest (VOI) (ranging from 3 to 8 cm3, depending on brain dimensions) located in the ganglio-capsular region of the right hemisphere (Figure 1).",5db0b331-bbde-46c8-b3fe-31a514c7ec95
2,methods2," The area was chosen based upon optimal shimming with similar concentrations as in cortex and for its reproducibility [40]. All examinations were performed under sedation via Sevorane. All the acquisitions were performed after an automatic second order shimming on the volume of interest, and a visual inspection on the inline display was used to check for data quality. Water suppression was also applied as implemented in the Siemens platform to avoid baseline distortion. A further unsuppressed water spectrum with only 16 averages was acquired for reference purposes.  4.4. Data Processing Metabolite concentrations were estimated using linear combination model (LCModel) [42]. An appropriate basis-dataset was used and water signal served as internal standard for absolute quantification. The reliability of metabolite quantification was judged upon Cramer Rao lower bounds (Cramer Rao lower bounds (CRLB)) as well as spectra linewidth.",1a8c4f86-acc2-47e6-9823-1c6a6f713732
3,methods3," The standard recommended quality criterion of Cramer Rao lower bounds (CRLB) < 20% was applied to exclude glutathione (GSH) concentration values which were not reliable for the following analysis. Signal to Noise Ratio was also included as a factor for quality control.  4.5. Statistical Analysis Heteroscedastic T-test was used to assess metabolite concentrations differences between KD and HC, setting the significance at 0.05. Correlations between glutathione (GSH) and blood serum 3HB concentrations, as well as between glutathione (GSH) and number of weekly epileptic seizures (see Table 1), were also investigated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. All analyses were performed in Matlab (Matlab R2017a, The Mathworks, Inc., Natik, MA, USA).  5. Conclusions The present study reproduced, for the first time in vivo and in children, what has previously been observed in animal models.",6205cff4-3d66-4a3e-aa7c-ed5458880095
4,methods4," Further studies are needed to verify our results, extend our findings, and clarify whether glutathione (GSH) changes are specific for some brain areas. However, if confirmed by further investigations, our results may suggest a protective role for KD in the brain by influencing the redox balance.
