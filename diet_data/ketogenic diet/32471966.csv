0,methods0," Molecular Genetic Testing  Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes and whole-exome sequencing (whole exome sequencing (WES)) was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) with an Agilent SureSelectXT Human All Exon V7 capture kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Data processing, variants annotation, and filtering were performed as previously described [7]. We analyzed a virtual panel (hereditary spastic paraplegia, 147 genes) in patient 2, and the CYP27A1 and SLC2A1 genes in patients 1 and 3, respectively. Identified variants were interpreted according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (and Genomics (ACMG)) variant classification guidelines [8]. They were subsequently confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Segregation analysis by Sanger sequencing was performed in the parents of proband 3.  3. Results  3.1.",8218f91a-95d3-4a76-9fc3-60709f1649f7
1,methods1," Proband 1  A 61-year-old woman presented with an 8-year history of progressive spastic tetraparesis, predominantly affecting lower extremities, and cerebellar ataxia, causing walking difficulties. Subsequently, cognitive decline, including severe attention deficit, dysexecutive syndrome, and memory loss, was documented. She also experienced chronic diarrhea, which caused a 10 kg weight loss over 10 years. The review of her medical history revealed that she underwent bilateral cataract surgery at age 44 and that she developed a bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. She was born to healthy parents not known to be consanguineous. She had a twin sister (unknown zygosity) who developed a similar progressive phenotype, including cognitive dysfunction, cerebellar ataxia, spastic tetraparesis, and cataract from age 45, before her death from a cardiac disease at age 57 (Figure 1A). The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was suspected.",db94a7e5-d5d0-4bb3-b8d9-7788b1e8a8ef
2,methods2,"  Brain MRI showed bilateral hyperintensities of the periventricular and semi-oval centers white matter (Figure 1B). Furthermore, a nerve conduction study revealed a length-dependent sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy of lower limbs. Genetic testing excluded trinucleotide repeat disorders including spinocerebellar ataxias (spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA)) [1,2,3,6,7,9], Friedreich ataxia, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. Finally, the metabolic workup revealed increased levels of blood bile acids (25 μmol/L; normal value (n.v.) 0–10) and of cholestanol (59.99 μmol/L; n.v. 0–15.45) compatible with the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX)). cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was confirmed by the identification of the pathogenic splice-site variant c.1184 + 1G>A in homozygosity in intron 6 of the CYP27A1 gene.",14bfb4b2-b6cb-4ebd-855c-1dd958aa7a2d
3,methods3,"  Following the diagnosis, a focused clinical examination confirmed the absence of tendinous xanthomas. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid was introduced, and at the one-year follow-up, her blood cholestanol levels had normalized (13.3 μmol/L; n.v. 0–15.45). The diarrhea had disappeared, she had gained 4 kg, and a mild improvement in her cognitive function was found.  3.2. Proband 2  A 32-year-old man presented with a 5-year history of stiffness, spasms, and paresthesia of lower limbs, with progressive gait difficulties and occasional falls. He also experienced urinary urgencies and incontinence, as well as sexual dysfunction. Neurological examination revealed a tetrapyramidal syndrome predominantly affecting his lower extremities. The proband had three older brothers, two of which experienced similar but even more severe neurological symptoms (Figure 1C).",69b32b4d-0363-4687-a5f7-20578d00203d
4,methods4," His mother may have had (phasic) cervical dystonia and the maternal grandmother was reported to have had late onset stiffness and gait difficulties.  A nerve conduction study and brain and spine MRI were normal. The analysis of the whole exome sequencing (WES) data focused on a hereditary spastic paraplegia gene panel (147 genes) allowed the identification of the pathogenic variant c.1880T>A (p.Leu627His) in hemizygosity in the ABCD1 gene, confirming the diagnosis of X-ALD. Elevated plasmatic very-long-chain fatty acids (very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)) corroborated this diagnosis (C24/22: 1.68; n.v. 0.3–1.1, C26/22: 0.075; n.v. 0.002–0.025 and C26: 2.8 μmol/L; n.v. 0.3–1.9). The clinical phenotype was suggestive of an adrenomyeloneuropathy (adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)), a typical adult-onset presentation of X-ALD.",d6605d6a-9bd2-4126-bf8d-5c4cc055f4fa
5,methods5,"  Addison’s disease, being typically associated with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), informed a subsequent clinical evaluation of the patient, looking more specifically for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency, which indeed revealed chronic fatigue, difficulty with weight gain, cravings for salty food, and orthostatic hypotension. Gingival hyperpigmentation was observed (Figure 1D). Addison’s disease was confirmed by documenting an elevated plasmatic adrenocorticotropic hormone (adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)) (167 ng/L, n.v. 9–50) and an abnormal response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation (cortisol level 1 h post i.v. injection of synacthen (0.25 mg): 353 nmol/L, n.v. > 500). Hormone replacement therapy with glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone) and mineralocorticoids (fludrocortisone) was initiated. An emergency card for Addison’s disease was given to the patient.",84efdca3-8978-41c7-8fd3-6864ced99372
6,methods6," Along with a genetic counselling, a family information letter was provided to the patient to give his siblings the opportunity to be evaluated at our clinic given their symptoms suggestive of adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN).  3.3. Proband 3  The proband was a 28-year-old woman born to healthy, unrelated parents (Figure 1E). Hypotonia and progressive microcephaly were observed during the first months of life. Her development was delayed (independent walking at age 2.5 years and language acquisition at 4 years) and she received special education. From age 2, various movement disorders including dystonic postures of fingers, dyskinesia, myoclonus, ataxia, and spasticity of lower limbs were reported. During this period, she also developed epilepsy with absence seizures and was treated with valproate.",ae1772cb-910e-41b0-9ce3-7c6398c474f6
7,methods7," In addition, the patient presented with paroxysmal episodes of variable semiology including stiffness of the right hemibody, or hypotonia, causing difficulty walking, apathy, headache, nausea and vomiting, followed by somnolence.  Extensive investigations performed in the first years of life did not produce a diagnosis. In particular, a cerebral MRI at age 1 year revealed non-specific cortical white matter anomalies. Her karyotype and the methylation of the region of chromosome 15, which is involved in Angelman syndrome, were normal. Laboratory investigations excluded an amino acid, organic acid, or a fatty acid β-oxidation disorder. However, hypoglycorrhachia (1.5 mmol/L; n.v. 2.8–4.4 mmol/L) with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/blood glucose ratio (0.25; n.v. 0.6) were identified. The CSF lactate concentration was also decreased (0.92 mmol/L; n.v. 1.2–2.1).",3b2e41a4-a6e2-4170-a0b9-06fce846b0dd
8,methods8," Despite these results, which are compatible with a glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1 DS), no definitive diagnosis was made at the time.  The patient was referred many years later (age 27 years) for a recently developed quasi-fixed cervical dystonia (Figure 1F) without evidence of cervical or brain lesions. Common infectious, metabolic, drug-induced, and autoimmune causes were excluded. Symptomatic treatment with oral anticholinergic biperiden and focal injections of the botulinum toxin allowed for partial relief. The review of her childhood medical records led to the suspicion of Glut1 DS. next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis confirmed this diagnosis by identifying the de novo pathogenic variant c.1259T>G in heterozygosity in the SLC2A1 gene, resulting in the substitution of a highly conserved methionine to an arginine residue in position 420 in the 11th transmembrane segment. A ketogenic diet was initiated.",8214c528-2606-4bc6-b7d6-6218e953d567
9,methods9," At the 6 month follow-up, the mother of the patient reported a clear improvement in cervical posturing and a disappearance of hyperkinetic appendicular movements.  4. Discussion  We present three patients with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) with different neurological manifestations in whom an accurate diagnosis was achieved through next generation sequencing (NGS), allowing for personalized treatments.  Patient 1 and her deceased sister would have benefited from an earlier diagnosis and treatment. The beneficial effect of chenodeoxycholic acid on neurological symptoms is considered greater when prescribed earlier in the course of the disease by preventing irreversible damage to the nervous system [10,11]. Interestingly, long diagnostic delays appear to be common in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) [12]. This may be due to the lack of awareness of this rare disorder and to the variability in its phenotype.",386aea8d-11ee-4913-bd0d-0b2bc4ed6e01
10,methods10," For example, in the spinal form of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), xanthomas and other typical features may be absent [13]. Moreover, depending on the health system, refusal of medical insurance providers to cover the costs of genetic testing because of the alleged lack of therapeutic consequences may delay the diagnostic process. Taken together, shortening the time to diagnosis is challenging in a field constantly growing in complexity. For this reason, we think that the diagnostic process requires a close collaboration between a multidisciplinary team of physicians who are familiar with rare diseases, including clinical geneticists, metabolic specialists, neurologists, neuroradiologists, and ophthalmologists. In addition, genetic databases and websites, as well platforms for data sharing like Matchmaker Exchange, have become resources at least as important as direct interactions with renowned experts in specific fields [14,15].",334d63f3-fe0c-4249-a916-0aeff916e8a3
11,methods11," Finally, the awareness of clinical, biological, and radiological red flags and symptom constellations suggestive of a treatable neurogenetic disorder will contribute to reducing the time to diagnosis [2]. For example, chronic diarrhea, juvenile cataracts, or tendon xanthomas in patients with progressive neurological symptoms strongly point to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), as highlighted by Mignarri et al. [12].  In patient 3, the diagnosis of Glut1 DS was delayed for decades, thereby preventing the implementation of a ketogenic diet, a treatment shown to be effective in controlling seizures and improving movement disorders [9,16,17]. This diagnostic wavering may be explained by the sparse medical knowledge about this newly described syndrome in the early 1990s when most of the investigations were conducted [18,19]. This illustrates the necessity of periodical re-evaluations of patients with unexplained neurologic disorders.",d747739f-79cb-4e6a-8869-292eee950e93
12,methods12," Medical knowledge in clinical genetics is constantly progressing, driven by rapidly evolving diagnostic technologies. However, long diagnostic processes may be challenging in adults with an early-onset neurodevelopmental disorder, as this category of patients is often unable to seek medical attention by themselves and may receive limited attention from the community. Consequently, they tend to be less thoroughly investigated than children, which also implies that medical knowledge about the natural history and late-onset complications of rare childhood-onset syndromes is often missing. Atypical adult presentation different from the textbook phenotype defined in children may lead to a missed diagnosis [20].  In patient 2, the clinical phenotype suggested hereditary spastic paraplegia, a large group of diseases encompassing dozens of overlapping entities [21].",4a92e06f-2a2d-40b3-b934-78e3296a8edf
13,methods13," next generation sequencing (NGS) was instrumental to the diagnosis of X-ALD in this patient who had normal CNS imaging and no clinical clues to this particular diagnosis prior to genetic testing. This diagnosis allowed for the initiation of corticosteroid replacement therapy, which may prevent a potential adrenal insufficiency crisis. Moreover, allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation might be indicated in patients developing the cerebral form of the disease [22].  In all these cases, the availability and rapidity of next generation sequencing (NGS) allowed for the confirmation of the diagnosis. The genotype-first diagnostic process has become common with the recent advances and increasing availability in clinical settings of genetic technologies, including next generation sequencing (NGS) and DNA microarray, bringing with it greater opportunities for diagnosing patients and multiple family members [23,24].",929039b0-84ed-4afd-bc09-7e03675cb05c
14,methods14," Complementary to the classic phenotype to genotype method, this approach in particular is indispensable in diagnosing atypical forms of a given disease or conditions characterized by unspecific clinical features, such as cognitive deficiency or autism. However, it poses the challenge of data interpretation knowing that the next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of large gene panels can lead to the identification of variants of unknown significance and incidental findings [8,25]. Current knowledge and international guidelines for variant interpretation are helpful but still insufficient to remove a large amount of noise when attempting to assign significance to particular findings [8,26].  Our case studies illustrate typical medical trajectories encountered by rare-disease patients due to the complexity of their condition, but also the potential for improvement in diagnosis delay and care due to expanding genetic technologies and awareness of this field within the medical community.",43bdbb48-32b6-43ef-ba68-fa913f2383f6
15,methods15," Although the increasing amount of available genetic data from control populations and patients, together with the sophistication of diagnostic tools, will facilitate the diagnostic process in the future, the development of emerging therapies will further increase the importance of quick and accurate molecular diagnosis.
