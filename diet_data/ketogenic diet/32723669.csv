0,discussion0," Super-refractory status epilepticus is a neurological emergency with a guarded prognosis. Prognosis and future outcomes depend on the successful and timely management of the condition.  Status epilepticus is defined as super-refractory when seizures continue clinically or electrographically on continuous video EEG monitoring for more than 24 hours despite induction of pharmacologically induced coma with highly sedating anesthetic agents, or recurrence of seizures when weaning off from anesthetics [4,5].  Management of super-refractory status epilepticus requires monitoring in the intensive care unit with anesthetics and anticonvulsants. Benzodiazepines remain the first-line agents in status epilepticus and require midazolam with assisted mechanical ventilation with continued seizure activity. Second-line anticonvulsants may follow. The commonly used second-line anticonvulsants are phenytoin, phenobarbital, and levetiracetam.",a2eadeea-0ba4-4c1c-b1a3-1c67675b29b2
1,discussion1," There is limited evidence that one is superior to the other when compared in clinical trials. The choice depends on the existing comorbidities in each patient. Levetiracetam is avoided in patients with renal failure, and phenytoin and phenobarbital are avoided in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Super-refractory status epilepticus warrants the need for third-line agents and if needed. Additional options including hypothermia, electroconvulsive therapy, and infusions of pyridoxine and magnesium. Lesionectomy and resective epilepsy surgery are indicated in the case of an identified lesion being the epileptogenic focus including tumors, cavernous malformations, medial temporal sclerosis, or in cases of herpes encephalitis with a predilection for the temporal lobe. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage is also used in limited cases. Neuromodulation techniques are used in select cases including transcranial magnetic stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, and deep brain stimulation [4,5].",5672e905-3d2f-4963-8ef0-dab14a66d86d
2,discussion2,"  The main limitations to therapy for status epilepticus are the duration of the stay in the intensive care unit and the withdrawal from anesthetics. This is a challenge due to their highly sedating properties and subsequent need to monitor for recurrence. The use of midazolam, phenobarbital, and propofol is successful in the resolution of super-refractory status epilepticus. The primary focus is to monitor the patients and prevent the common recurrence of seizures. This may require the addition of multiple anticonvulsants, monitoring their side-effects, maximizing their dosages, and if needed, using additional therapies such as resective surgeries in cases with guarded prognosis [5].  Intensive seizure monitoring in the ICU remains the cornerstone of management and is the standard of care to monitor seizures, brief ictal rhythmic discharges, isolated seizures, or recurrence of status epilepticus. The goal is to achieve a balanced approach in which the risk of recurrence is minimized.",6e5fe0d5-445c-40fa-a120-2e48031d25c1
3,discussion3," However, complete resolution of seizures should not be expected. Patients with isolated or brief seizures can be treated in the non-ICU environment and subsequently as out-patients. Prolonged ICU stay can cause infections including urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep venous thrombosis, critical illness myopathies and neuropathies, ICU delirium, and blood infections which further complicates the management of the primary condition [5].  Another challenge in the treatment of super-refractory status epilepticus is that there is limited evidence regarding alternative available approaches in the management of this condition as benzodiazepines remain the first-line treatment [35].  There have been strides in basic science research over the last two decades which show that seizures tend to endure as a result of an imbalance between excessive and insufficient neuronal excitation, or due to a defect in the neuronal inhibition systems [185,186].",29adc706-fbd1-49ad-bd02-aeae1a17b48a
4,discussion4," The common inhibitory neurotransmitter, Î³-Aminobutyric acid (gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)), inhibits neurons from excess excitation through the activation of the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, and the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, controls excitation through the N-methyl-S-aspartate (N methyl D aspartate (NMDA)) receptor [187]. SE can become self-sustaining with neuronal damage and pharmacoresistance, progressing to RSE or Super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) [188]. A process known as receptor trafficking can occur in Super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) in which there is an increase in the number of glutaminergic receptors at the cell surface and a decrease in gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, resulting in decreased gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic activity [189].",5479b911-6240-479b-97d9-d80a20021176
5,discussion5," Besides receptor trafficking, there could be a plethora of other mechanisms contributing to the existence of SE, RSE, and Super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) which can be utilized as potential therapeutic targets. Some of the reported mechanisms include mitochondrial failure or insufficiency, inflammatory processes that disrupt the blood-brain barrier, deficiency of cofactors and vitamins, control mechanisms of calcium flux, and genetic alterations [190, 191-194]. Pathophysiological processes are related to the processes of protein phosphorylation and activation channels in neurons. Antiepileptic drugs available carry out their activity in the transport of intracellular vesicles, or through the activity of inhibitory receptors [195].  Studies have also shown that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress occur rapidly in the brain during SE and have the potential to continue to persist, creating the acute and long-term sequelae of SE [196].",620186e1-f7b1-4c83-b5dc-ebb21005bf4f
6,discussion6," Reactive oxygen species (Reactive oxygen species (ROS)) have been indicated to be a mediator in neuronal injury and are considered to produce proinflammatory cytokines during epilepsy [197]. A potential biomarker for epilepsy known as high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) has recently emerged. HMGB1 activates macrophages, endothelial cells, and other immune response pathways and thus elevates pro-inflammatory protein levels [198]. Studies have shown that there is an increase in the level of HMGB1 within 3-4h after drug-resistant epilepsy [199]. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress markers are measurable in peripheral blood and by neuroimaging [196]. These findings show a promising avenue for developing prognostic and predictive mechanistic biomarkers in people exposed to status epilepticus.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been indicated to play a role in epileptogenesis [200]. High levels of miRNA-23a, miRNA-34a, miRNA-132, miRNA-146a, in particular, were frequently detected.",5f945db6-2763-4c9f-af71-f799c31830f7
7,discussion7," Additionally, increased levels of miRNA-21, miRNA-29a, miRNA-132, identified to be regulated by p53, were noted to be involved in episodes of seizures [201]. In particular, Wang et al. reported that miRNA-451 has the potential to be a biomarker for refractory epilepticus [202]. Specific miRNAs can be investigated to see if they are potential biomarkers for different types of epilepsies such as SE, RSE, and Super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE).  Lastly, translational research involving animal-to-human studies which identify potential biomarkers as specific molecular targets can help us to develop novel therapeutic agents. Once identified in animal models, these biomarkers can then be tested in human subjects for efficacy by conducting multicenter clinical trials.  Conclusion  Super-refractory status epilepticus remains a common neurological emergency encountered in intensive care units throughout the world and remains a significant management challenge.",68dd9b7f-7d23-4d7f-a538-5b9569a55336
8,discussion8, Morbidity and mortality of super-refractory status epilepticus depend on initial effective treatment by induction of pharmacological coma to abort refractory seizures. Clinicians and patients would benefit from a comprehensive meta-analysis of prognostic factors and studies directed to management and their outcomes. There continues to be a need for large randomized multicenter drug trials to test the efficacy of new treatment strategies in this refractory condition.
