0,introduction0,"Metabolic syndrome and osteoporosis are medical conditions that must not be overlooked, since both may lead to serious problems in the aged (1). Metabolic syndrome is characterized by abdominal obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension and dyslipidemia (2). The accumulating studies reported that metabolic disturbance might be a risk factor for osteoporosis. Increased insulin resistance promotes osteolysis of inflammatory cytokines in patients with metabolic syndrome, triggering osteoporosis (3). Moreover, higher serum lipid level resulting from metabolic syndrome is considered to play a critical factor in pathogenesis of osteoporosis (4).  Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease which is characterized as hyperglycemia resulted from defects in insulin action and/or insulin secretion (5). It has negative effects on skeletal disorders, including osteopenia or osteoporosis (6).",65ed86e9-2563-4f7f-b297-f046ff263f2f
1,introduction1," It is known that type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) compromises bone microstructures by suppressing growth potential and worsening insulin resistance and glycemic control (7). By carrying out an MRI-based assessment, Naiemh et al. (8) found that young women with T1DM were more likely to suffer from trabecular bone volume and trabecular numbers reduction. Shortened femur length, reduced growth plate thickness, compromised cancellous and cortical bone, and decreased collagen II expression were observed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic animal models (9, 10).  Ketogenic diet (KD) is a well-established therapeutic intervention for patients with refractory epilepsy (11). By maintaining a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet with restricted protein intake, systemic ketosis raises seizure threshold for intractable epilepsy treatment (12). However, it was firstly reported by Hahn that KD had deleterious effects on bone mass in children who maintained this regimen in long term (13).",fb718504-1c0b-43a2-86c5-b50d9c4408b8
2,introduction2," Our previous studies also confirmed that KD compromised bone micro-structures and reduced bone biomechanics in rodents (14–18). However, the different effects of streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia and KD-induced hyperketonemia on bone micro-structures and biomechanics have not been elucidated.  The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia on appendicular bone. Micro-CT scan and biomechanical test were performed to evaluate the bone mass and biomechanical properties, and both the serological and histological bone turnover markers were observed to evaluate the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts after intervention.

19,discussion0,"This study proved that both hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia induce bone compromising in rats by reducing bone mass, disturbing the balance of osteoblast and osteoclast, and impairing the biomechanical properties. Nevertheless the effects of these two kind of metabolic disturbance on bone had some differences. Hyperketonemia induced by KD resulted in more compromised more in cancellous bone with little effect on cortical bone, while hyperglycemia caused by DM had adverse effects on both the cancellous bone and cortical bone, influencing the bone length as well.  It has been long thought that diabetes mellitus negatively affects bone metabolism. Using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, several cross-sectional studies revealed that both cortical and trabecular bone tend to be more fragile in diabetes patients, which increases fracture risk (20, 21).",aeaeda6d-218f-4aba-81ef-990739ef14f1
20,discussion1," Diabetes mellitus reduces bone density and bone strength by inhibiting osteoblast activity and enhancing osteoclast activity (22). Guo et al. (23) found that alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity in serum were significantly decreased in the streptozotocin (STZ)-injected rats. Meanwhile, other researchers found that serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was greatly increased in diabetic rats and serum tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) level was also greatly increased (24). The findings of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity were consistent, though the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level showed differences among studies. In the present study, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was remarkably reduced in the DM rats, and the tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) concentration was significantly raised.",46a35c08-a0d4-4c6e-a784-b6075d0811cc
21,discussion2," Moreover, N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) and C-telopeptide of type I collagen (collagen (CTX)), as the specific biomarkers of bone formation and resorption, have been recommended for clinical application. A clinical research study into the bone turnover biomarkers showed that a corrective relationship exists between serum P1NP level and histomorphometric bone formation estimates, and between serum collagen (CTX) and histomorphometric bone resorption estimates (25). The present study found that the P1NP concentration of the DM group was decreased by 56.2% and the β-collagen (CTX) level increased by 143.1% in comparison with the sham group. We are inclined to the view that the functions of osteoblasts and osteoclasts were responsible for the bone loss in the DM rats which occurred at least 3 months later.  Abnormal bone metabolism indicators bring about deteriorated bone microarchitectures. Ma et al.",923e089a-bbc1-4f6a-aba3-1d70526f8f4d
22,discussion3," (26) found a trabecular number and volume decrease and trabecular separation increase of femur in diabetic rats. In the present study, a remarkable tissue mineral density (TMD) and Conn.D decrease was found in the diabetic rats with less bone volume fraction, lower trabecular number, thinner trabecular thickness, and wider trabecular separation. Similarly, diabetes deteriorates cortical bone and shortens bone length. Hyperglycemia increases the osteocyte lacunar density by decreasing osteocytic territorial matrix volume, thus increasing cellularity of cortical bone as well as affecting the bone length (27). The streptozotocin (STZ)-rats displayed an apparently smaller cortical area and a higher cortical porosity (28). The micro-CT data showed that the bone area, the total area and cortical thickness of the mid-shaft of femur were significantly decreased in the DM rats than those in the sham rats. The lengths of tibia and femur of the diabetic rats were remarkably shortened.",c384ba14-f59c-4286-9fab-8370ee814926
23,discussion4," The bone trabecular and cortical bone parameters exhibited that diabetes not only affects the status of cancellous bone and cortical bone, but also affects the bone growth.  The status of cortical bone plays a critical role in bone strength. Supportive findings have shown that diabetes mellitus is associated with increased risk of hip fracture and other fractures (29). In the rodent models, diabetes significantly weakened bone strengths by impairing cortical bone microarchitectures (30, 31). Three-point bending test has been proven as a useful method to measure biomechanical properties of cortical bone in rodents (32). In this study, the biomechanical properties of cortical bone of the diabetic rats were significantly weakened, which was manifested as lower maximum load, stiffness and energy absorption, compared with the sham group.",807585e9-a1a4-42f3-9dcd-88479920adb9
24,discussion5," Moreover, simulated compressive test based on micro-finite element analysis is an effective technique for evaluation of cancellous bone since it has an irregular structures. Consistent with the bone parameters from micro-CT, the micro-FEA results also showed that the stiffness and failure load were significantly decreased in the DM group compared with the sham group. The results from the biomechanical tests indicated that both the cortical bone and cancellous bone were deteriorated in the diabetic rats.  Researches on the effects of hyperketonemia induced by KD on bone microstructures and bone qualities in rodents were performed in our previous studies. KD deteriorated microstructures of cancellous bone by decreasing bone mass and impairing biomechanical properties, as well as inhibiting osteogenic process and enhancing osteoclastic process in the BMSCs (15, 17). Akihiro et al.",9ba5fab2-11ba-4957-9130-4359a312791c
25,discussion6," (33) found that ketone bodies bidirectionally modulate osteoblast functions, which suggests that ketone bodies is an important endogenous factor that regulates bone metabolism in both physiological and pathological situations. And they pointed out that β-hydroxybutyrate significantly reduced the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization in osteoblasts. It was confirmed in this study that hyperketonemia severely impaired cancellous bone and its’ biomechanical properties, and cortical bone was partly affected. The underlying mechanism might be that hyperketonemia inhibits the osteoblast activity and increases the osteoclast activity.  Both hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia have obvious adverse effects on bone. The results of this study showed that both hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia deteriorated cancellous bone and weakened its biomechanical properties, which might be attributed to the changes of activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.",903e24ab-4c21-4a02-8d7c-fc27c083bf6c
26,discussion7," However, there were differences existing between the two effects. Firstly, hyperglycemia had more adverse effects on cortical bone than hyperketonemia. It was found that the DM rats exhibited smaller Barea and Tarea, and thinner Ct.Th than the sham and KD rats. The Ct.Th was thinner in the KD rats compared to the sham group, which was consistent with the results of biomechanical properties. Secondly, hyperglycemia induced by diabetes significantly inhibited the bone growth. The lengths of tibia and femur in the DM rats were remarkably shorter than those in the sham and KD groups. In addition, hyperglycemia induced by diabetes and hyperketonemia induced by ketogenic diets provided similar effects on the bone turnover markers, which were decreasing the activity of osteoblasts and promoting the activity of osteoclasts. However, there was still a slight difference.",750a9d52-a69c-4711-a85e-892e148ebbc4
27,discussion8," According to the HE staining result, more adipocytes were found in the bone marrow cavity of the KD rats when compared with the sham and DM rats. This indicates that KD might have a stronger ability to differentiate BMSCs from osteoblasts to adipocytes.  It should be noted that the affecting mechanisms of hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia on bone are still unknown. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) plays a central role in growth, development and metabolism, and it contributes to normal longitudinal bone growth and cortical bone size as well as the maintenance of bone mass in adults (34). IGF-1 is highly expressed in osteoblasts and chondrocytes, and it brings its bone anabolic effects into play through promoting osteoblasts differentiation and bone mineralization (35, 36). IGF-1’s stimulation of osteoblast differentiation is a result of activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through the PI3K/Akt pathway (37). Ma et al.",e9ed1f3b-0faa-459b-96eb-1dcc83b1c980
28,discussion9," (26) indicated that diabetes may damage bone microarchitectures and bone strengths through Sema3A/IGF-1/β-catenin signaling pathway. In our previous study, KD reduced serological IGF-1 and delayed the spinal fusion (38). Bielohuby et al. (39) pointed out that diet-induced reduction in GH/IGF system components probably aggravated the bone phenotype, which might be an important factor in the KD-induced bone loss. The serological IGF-1 level decreased in both the DM and KD groups, with a lower trend in the DM group. Therefore, the systemic changes of IGF-1 might, in some extent, explain the mechanism of hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia on bone growth, bone development, and bone mass accrual. In addition, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are diverse compounds that generated via a non-enzymatic reaction between reducing sugars and the amine residues on proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.",69057b91-b250-4088-8332-b2606fa5d12d
29,discussion10," Growing evidence concerning bone fracture in patients with diabetes mellitus indicates the crucial roles of AGEs in aggravating bone fragility (40). However, ketogenic diet improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (41), and 3-β-hydroxybutyrate (the main component of a ketone body) inhibits the glycation process, decreases glucose binding to the protein, and prevents the formation of AGEs (42). Therefore, AGEs might not be a common role in the bone deterioration induced by hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia, but further study is needed.  Certain limitations of this study must be mentioned. On one hand, the effects of hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia on bone were observed at a single time point. The diﬀerent time points and dynamic changes of bone microstructures and histomorphometry (such as calcein stain) need to be further studied.",7d7e5331-f9c6-4ab3-a406-2877c54ed07a
30,discussion11," On the other hand, the present study has only indicated that hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia have adverse effects on bone structures, but the underlying mechanisms should be further investigated.  In conclusion, the present study comprehensively compared the effects of hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia on the bone structures from various perspectives, such as serum biomarkers, bone length, biomechanical characteristics, bone microarchitectures, and the histomorphometry. The disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism have significant adverse effects on the bone tissues, which is worth calling more attention to in clinical practice.
