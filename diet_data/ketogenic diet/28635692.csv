0,introduction0,"Epileptic encephalopathy refers to a group of epileptic disorders that epileptic activities per se cause adverse impacts to the patient's development (1). Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE)) is a recently introduced concept with the advances in genetic diagnosis, as genetic etiologies can cause developmental delay irrespective of epileptic activities (2). The causes of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) can be various including structural and metabolic etiologies. Moreover, owing to advances in genetic testing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (next generation sequencing (NGS)), research has revealed that diverse genetic mutations, especially de novo monogenic mutations, constitute a significant portion of the etiologies of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (3).",57f9afcb-cdd0-4ccb-8b3a-6913cdb35a69
1,introduction1," The discovery of causative genes for developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) has amplified the efforts to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of each genetic mutation, with the ultimate objective of precision medicine. For example, ketogenic diet (KD), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-inhibitors, and retigabine are effective targeted treatments for glucose transporter type 1 deficiency, mTORopathies, and KCNQ2 encephalopathy, respectively (4–6).  The KD is an effective therapeutic option for various developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) syndromes (7–10), and may be an alternative to pharmacologic therapies. However, the effects of KD vary among patients and implementing KD even as a short-term trial is a great challenge for both patients and caregivers, owing to the restrictive diet regimen and potential side effects (11).",ab8d12af-a03e-435b-a6a3-4494acb39656
2,introduction2,"  Therefore, identifying those patients who are the most likely to respond to KD would be beneficial for determining with whom and when KD should be initiated. In the present study, we aimed to establish whether the effects of KD differ according to the type of genetic mutation, as confirmed by the targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel for developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE).

Patients showing ≥90% seizure reduction from baseline were considered responders. The KD efficacy was examined at 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation. Patients were divided into those with an identified pathogenic mutation (n = 73) and those without (n = 82). The KD efficacy in patients with each identified pathogenic mutation was compared with that in patients without identified genetic mutations.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with proven etiologies other than genetic etiology, such as structural, infectious, or immune encephalopathies; and (2) patients who underwent KD therapy for cognitive benefits rather than seizure control, owing to difficulties in assessing the efficacy of KD by seizure frequency.",e64266d6-fb4c-4f1b-909a-0f681b9ef319

Assessment of outcomes The seizure frequencies before KD (baseline) and at 3, 6, and 12 months after KD were obtained. The seizure frequency 2 months before KD initiation was defined as the “baseline.” When assessing the seizure frequency, the number of seizures that had occurred during the previous 2 months was counted. Patients were considered KD responders if they showed ≥90% seizure reduction from the baseline seizure frequency, while patients who showed < 90% seizure reduction were considered non-responders. The long-term treatment response to KD was defined as a reduction in seizure frequency at both 6 and 12 months compared to baseline.",efe8ccad-9450-41f4-8a92-2ad9f65008eb
6,methods3,"  The variables we evaluated with respect to their possible predictive value for a responder were as follows: age at seizure onset, sex, number of AEDs being taken at the time of KD initiation, lead time from seizure onset to KD initiation, the total duration of KD implementation, epilepsy syndrome, and pathogenic mutation. Regarding the epilepsy syndrome, the syndromes of each patient at the time of KD implementation were selected. To classify the epilepsy syndrome, we used the classifications outlined by the International League Against Epilepsy in their revised terminology and concepts for organization of seizures and epilepsies (1).  Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) panel for developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) The targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) panel for developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) at Severance Children's Hospital comprises 172 genes that are known to be related to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (Table S1).",90345aa4-aee2-4076-b485-fdd8dcf305c7

However, none of the other clinical variables we evaluated were related to a good KD response. In addition to the type of epileptic syndrome, we compared the efficacy of KD between different genotypes in order to reveal which genotypes are the most likely to respond well to KD. Our analysis demonstrated that patients with SCN2A, STXBP1, KCNQ2, and SCN1A mutations had more favorable responses to KD than did those without genetic mutations.

Although prior studies showed that for patients with STXBP1 encephalopathy, the response to KD was either slight or none (two case reports, each with one patient) (27, 28), in our study, all four patients with STXBP1 mutations responded well to KD.  Among patients with West syndrome, patients with CDKL5 mutations showed a significantly poorer response to KD than other West syndrome patients without CDKL5 mutation.

We also acknowledge the very small sample size of this study, due to rare nature of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) with identified pathogenic mutations. This study should therefore be regarded as elementary results demonstrating that specific genetic mutations show different response to KD. Due to the retrospective study design, the effects of KD on the developmental outcomes of these children were not evaluated. For patients without identified genetic mutations, some proportion of them is suspected to have a genetic origin owing to unknown pathogenic genes or genes that were not included in our next generation sequencing (NGS) panel.",ae070773-0bc3-428c-9ddb-0a3474bb10dc

Conclusions The KD was particularly effective in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) caused by SCN2A, STXBP1, KCNQ2, and SCN1A mutations and was not effective in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) caused by CDKL5 mutations. These results will provide a rational basis for considering early, targeted KD treatment rather than the traditional trial and error approach to epilepsy therapy in this group of patients. Furthermore, our data may help avoid overtreatment with KD in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) with CDKL5 mutations. ",16c5edc5-cf7a-4732-a2e8-33befa1b817f
