0,methods0,"4.1. Animals This study comprises the first part of our KETOSTROKE project in SLC5A8-deficient transgenic mice, a model with permanent ketone body deficiency [44]. We therefore used wild-type animals with the same genetic background as our SLC5A8-deficient animals for all experiments in this study. For the generation of this strain, see Suissa L. et al. (2019) [44]. The SLC5A8-deficient animals initially generated in a mixed C57BL6/129Sv background were back-crossed with commercial C57BL6/J (Janvier laboratories, Le-Genest-Saint-Isle, France) for seven generations. Then heterogenous males and females were mated to obtain homozygous control (wild-type) and homozygous SLC5A8-deficient mice. The homozygous wild-type mice were bred to produce the male animals used for our studies. Animals were fed a standard diet and given free access to food and drinking water throughout the study.",ab7f4cff-2e53-4688-85f3-16d085860bac

Blood Collection and Processing for LC-MS Analysis Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 15 min after oral gavage. Blood was collected from sacrificed animals and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation at 3000× g for 20 min et 4 °C, supernatants were removed, mixed with five volumes of methanol and incubated overnight at −20 °C for protein precipitation. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were vacuum-dried, resuspended in 80 µL of a 20:80 acetonitrile-H2O mixture (HPLC grade, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), and stored at −20 °C until use for LC-MS analysis.  4.4.",dfacacce-d4df-47f5-9e53-7ce4eb268b42

Ketone Ester®, H.V.M.N., CA, USA) per gram of body weight or with the same volume of 0.9% NaCl. For whole brain analyses, freshly collected brains were cut into two equal parts along their median line. Each part was homogenized immediately in methanol and incubated overnight at −20 °C. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed, vacuum-dried, resuspended in 80 µL of a 20:80 acetonitrile-H2O mixture (HPLC grade, Merck Millipore), and stored at −20 °C until use in LC-MS analysis. For regional analyses, whole brains were removed 15 min after intraperitoneal injection of 3 mg DL-β-hydroxybutyrate sodium salt (salt (SIGMA)-ALDRICH, Saint-Louis, MO, USA) per gram of body weight in 0.9% NaCl or with the same volume of 0.",e4485afe-968a-41ce-95e9-5c4ba38d02eb

Specific parts of the slices were carefully removed from the slides by scraping with a scalpel. The remaining tissue was detached from the slides with 70% methanol and incubated overnight at −20 °C. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed, vacuum-dried, resuspended in 80 µL of a 20:80 acetonitrile-H2O mixture (HPLC grade, Merck Millipore), and stored at −20 °C until use in LC-MS analysis.  4.5. LC-MS Analysis Chromatographic analysis was performed with the DIONEX Ultimate 3000 HPLC system coupled to a chromatographic column (Phenomenex Synergi 4 u Hydro-RP 80A 250 × 3.0 mm) set at 40 °C and a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min.

The heated electrospray ionization source (HESI II) was used in positive and negative ion modes. The instrument was operated in full scan mode from m/z 67 to m/z 1000. High-resolution accurate mass (High resolution accurate mass (HRAM)) full-scan MS and top five MS/MS spectra were collected in a data-dependent fashion at a resolving power of 70,000 and 35,000 at FWHM m/z 200, respectively. The post-treatment of data was performed using the MZmine2 version 2.53 (http://mzmine.github.io/; Boston, MA, USA) [45]. Metabolites were identified using the Human Metabolome Database version 4.0 [46]. LC-MS analyses were performed in a blinded assessment; that is, without revealing the identity of the samples to the mass spectroscopist prior to analyses.  4.6.",7abfe7b6-2139-4675-8c4c-b8b005f360b9
6,methods6," Glucose and β-Hydroxybutyrate Enzymatic Measurements Blood glucose and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were quantified in venous blood samples with enzyme-based reagent strips using a Glucometer and a Ketometer (OneTouch Verio, LifeScan Inc., Burnaby, BC, Canada), respectively. Blood samples were obtained by incision of the tail vein with a lance. 2 µL samples were drawn before (t = 0) and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 180, and 240 min after ketone or NaCl administration. Measurements were performed by researchers without knowing the treatment group.  4.7. Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel software for all experiments. Continuous variables are presented as means with standard deviation. Parametric Student’s t-tests were used to compare different conditions after carrying out Shapiro–Wilk normality test. To determine linear correlations between two parameters, the coefficient of determination denoted R2 was assessed. A p-value < 0.",c13a90af-6940-4d3c-84ce-61aca11692e5

Conclusions The orally ingested ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate led to rapid and significant ketosis in KE-gavaged non-fasting mice. Our results show, for the first time, that exogenous βHB led to an increase of acetyl-CoA and the citric cycle intermediates in the brain. In addition, we found that the increased level of acetyl-CoA inhibited glycolysis in a feedback reaction and thus, competed with glucose under physiological conditions. The effects of ketone ester administration on the mouse brain that we describe here strongly support the potential of these agents for neuroprotection studies in the case of acute neurological diseases.
