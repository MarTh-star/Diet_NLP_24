2,results0," Pyruvate carboxylase is required for hepatic gluconeogenesis but has a minimal impact on fasting blood glucose  Upon fasting, pyruvate carboxylase is activated by acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid ß-oxidation to generate oxaloacetate (OAA) from pyruvate for hepatic gluconeogenesis. To better understand the requirements for Pcx in hepatic metabolism, we generated a hepatocyte-specific deletion of pcx in mice. Pcx transgenic mice from the European Mutant Mouse Archive (C57BL/6NTac-Pcx Tm1a) were obtained and bred to Flpe germline deleter mice (Jax #5705) to generate mice with Pcx that contain a floxed exon 10. These mice were then bred to Albumin-Cre mice to generate a hepatocyte-specific deletion of pyruvate carboxylase (PcxL−/−) and littermate controls (Pcxf/f). The loss of Pcx in the liver of PcxL−/− mice was validated at the mRNA and protein level (Fig. 1, A and B). The loss of Pcx did not alter the body weight of male or female mice under fed or fasted conditions (Fig. 1C).",27622d3b-95a9-47f7-9898-2ab428c6b365
3,results1," The hepatic-specific loss of Pcx resulted in a statistically significant suppression of both fed and fasted blood glucose of PcxL−/− mice (Fig. 1D). However, this small suppression in blood glucose is not likely physiologically significant. The loss of Pcx did result in an increase in circulating lactate, consistent with human inborn errors of pyruvate carboxylase deficiency (OMIM # 266150) (8) (Fig. 1E). PcxL−/− mice exhibited normal circulating nonesterified fatty acid (nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA)) and triglycerides (TGs) (Fig. 1F). The ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) was increased in fed PcxL−/− mice, suggesting a greater reliance on fatty acid oxidation as an energy source (Fig. 1G). Finally, liver TG content was increased in PcxL−/− mice following a 24 h fast consistent with an increased reliance on fatty acid catabolism (Fig. 1H).",330d91b7-9290-45a4-bef1-b60b11708e1c

Given that PcxL−/− mice were able to maintain circulating fasting glucose concentrations, we next examined the requirement for pyruvate carboxylase in hepatic gluconeogenesis directly. We isolated primary hepatocytes from control and PcxL−/− mice. We then incubated the hepatocytes with 1-13C–labeled lactate or U-13C–labeled glutamine and measured the production of glucose from these substrates (Fig. 2A). The loss of pyruvate carboxylase suppressed the ability of hepatocytes to perform gluconeogenesis as the total production of glucose in vitro was suppressed (Fig. 2, B and C). Specifically, glucose production from lactate (Fig. 2B) or glutamine (Fig. 2C) was significantly suppressed, consistent with another pyruvate carboxylase loss of function model (9). In total, these results show that while pyruvate carboxylase is required for gluconeogenesis, other gluconeogenic tissues (e.g.",de791b6c-34f6-4dfa-ba36-f2e352257122

Out of ∼22,000 transcripts annotated, over 3900 transcripts were significantly altered in PcxL−/− mice with 437 induced and 397 suppressed by at least 2-fold (Fig. 7A). Gene ontology analysis of significantly altered transcripts did not identify meaningful overarching patterns within the data. However, there were transcripts of interest altered within the dataset. For example, trib3 was greater than 17-fold higher in PcxL−/− mice and significantly elevated in PcxL−/− liver in the fasted, high fat diet (HFD), and ketogenic diet–fed states.",b4e39a32-dcf8-4d82-9322-c47b578e825d

The fgf21, elovl7, and psat1 transcripts were also induced in the fasted and ketogenic diet–fed states (Fig. 7B). Finally, the stress responsive atf3, atf4, and atf5 were higher in fasted PcxL−/− liver (Fig. 7C). While atf4 was moderately elevated in PcxL−/− liver only in the fasted state, atf3 and atf5 were elevated in the fasted, high fat diet (HFD), and ketogenic diet–fed states (Fig. 7C).

18,results19," Western blotting using antiprotein lysine antibodies revealed an increase in the abundance of lysine-acetylated proteins compared to WT littermates in both the fed and fasting states (Fig. 8A). Indeed, fed PcxL−/− liver exhibited higher abundance of lysine-acetylated proteins than even 24 h fasted control liver. PcxL−/− mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) also exhibited a large increase in the abundance of lysine-acetylated proteins comparable to the increase observed by chow feeding (Fig. 8B). However, ketogenic diet–fed PcxL−/− and control mice exhibited a similar pattern of lysine-acetylated proteins, suggesting that the increase in lysine acetylation is associated with lipid oxidation. To gain a more granular view of the proteins with an increase in abundance of lysine-acetylated proteins, we mapped and quantified the differential abundance of lysine acetylated proteins via tandem mass tag (tandem mass tag (TMT))-based mass spectrometry (MS) (Table 2).",16fa2129-1395-4371-bcb5-32fc8e9f51dc

22,discussion0," Pyruvate, derived largely from glycolysis, alanine transamination, and lactate conversion, proceeds via two major fates once it enters the mitochondrial matrix. To contribute to the oxidative tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, it is oxidatively decarboxylated by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex generating acetyl-CoA and CO2. In this way, pyruvate can efficiently energize mitochondria and contribute to cellular ATP production. The other major fate for pyruvate is the biotin-dependent carboxylation to oxaloacetate (OAA) via pyruvate carboxylase. Pyruvate carboxylase is uniquely important for hepatic tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function in both the fed and fasted states by providing an anaplerotic source for gluconeogenesis and fatty acid biosynthesis. Here, we have removed pyruvate carboxylase specifically in the liver to better understand the contribution of pyruvate mediated anaplerosis to liver and systemic metabolism.",62513156-ab48-4800-983d-23ee86c9f198
23,discussion1," We have shown that the liver requires pyruvate carboxylase for gluconeogenesis, but its loss is well tolerated following a 24 h fast with a surprising metabolic resiliency. In fact, the suppression in hepatic gluconeogenesis protects PcxL−/− mice from high fat diet (HFD)-induced glucose intolerance. However, longer term feeding of carbohydrate depleted diets to PcxL-/- mice results in their rapid metabolic decompensation.  The majority of pyruvate is transported into the mitochondrial matrix via the Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier (Mpc) located in the mitochondrial inner membrane (15, 16). The loss of either of the components of the Mpc, Mpc1, or Mpc2 is not sufficient to fully block mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism as pyruvate can be generated by multiple compensatory pathways such as alanine transamination or supported by glutamine anaplerosis (17, 18, 19). There is no such alternative pathway to compensate for the loss of pyruvate carboxylase.",7d37b021-cf9b-44de-a3c3-0958bb04d286
24,discussion2," Surprisingly, we found that pyruvate carboxylase was uniquely required for gluconeogenesis and other substrates such as glutamine could not support gluconeogenesis in the absence of pyruvate carboxylase, consistent with the work of others (9). The biochemical rationale for why a KO of pyruvate carboxylase would be required for other sources of anaplerosis is not clear.  Fatty acid oxidation and pyruvate carboxylase activity are intimately connected. During fasting or starvation, fatty acids are oxidized in mitochondria to provide hepatocytes with ATP and NADH to facilitate gluconeogenesis and the carbon substrate (acetyl-CoA) for ketogenesis. This enables the liver to buffer blood glucose and provide alternative fuel (ketone bodies) for highly oxidative tissues during food deprivation. The loss of pyruvate carboxylase was associated with increased ketogenesis, suggesting their livers are likely relying on alternative fuels.",34275c5e-50f1-4a08-ade2-e70d61d0d914
25,discussion3," People with disparate inborn errors in fatty acid oxidation exhibit life-threatening hypoketotic hypoglycemic bouts following a fast. Fatty acids cannot contribute to a net increase in the carbon skeleton of glucose during gluconeogenesis in mammals. One of the important canonical roles of hepatic fatty acid oxidation is to enable gluconeogenesis. It does this in large part by providing acetyl-CoA to allosterically activate pyruvate carboxylase. Previously, we characterized a conditional loss of function of liver Cpt2 (Cpt2L−/−) mouse model with a lack of hepatic fatty acid oxidation and showed that they also exhibited a defect in hepatic gluconeogenesis but exhibited minimally altered glycemia following a 24 h fast (20). Also, similar to PcxL−/− mice, animals with a defect in hepatic fatty acid oxidation exhibited a rapid metabolic decompensation following a ketogenic diet at a similar timescale (20).",795768fc-55c7-41d8-b0a3-df71cbc715a6
26,discussion4," The similarities between the phenotypes of mice with liver-specific deficits in pyruvate carboxylase and fatty acid oxidation support their intimate connection.  The liver-specific loss of glucose-6-phosphatase results in a similar phenotype as PcxL−/− mice including fasting euglycemia with increased ketogenesis (21, 22). This suggests that hepatic glucose production from non-mitochondrial sources such as glycerol or glycogen are also not required to maintain fasting glycemia and that mammals possess a remarkable resiliency to fasting hypoglycemia. This resiliency is likely mediated by the sensing of metabolic stress. RNA-seq analysis of PcxL−/− mice demonstrated a transcriptional response indicative of a mitochondrial stress response including the induction of transcripts such as atf3, 4, and 5. These changes were minimally effected in the fed state but upon metabolic challenge like fasting or high fat feeding, they increased sometimes dramatically.",fa498e9d-83db-4153-a039-27ad34bb30af
27,discussion5," These results demonstrate a sophisticated mechanism for sensing and responding to metabolic stress.  PcxL−/− mice as well as Cpt2L−/− mice with a defect in hepatic fatty acid oxidation are resistant to diet-induced glucose intolerance (23). Insulin resistance results in two seemingly opposing phenomenon in the liver. Insulin-resistant individuals exhibit an inability to repress gluconeogenesis during carbohydrate replete conditions. Also, insulin-resistant livers promote de novo lipogenesis, although insulin is a powerful activator of fatty acid synthesis. These observations are seemingly at odds and have been termed selective insulin resistance (24). The long-sought mechanism of this selective insulin signaling has been elusive.",f6490c61-f54d-4d76-84d4-532b72c0afcd
28,discussion6," An alternative hypothesis suggests that the liver remains insulin sensitive and therefore promotes insulin-dependent de novo lipogenesis and that increased gluconeogenesis is mediated by activation of pyruvate carboxylase by acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid oxidation (5). Therefore, insulin resistance in the adipose and the inability to suppress lipolysis and fatty acid delivery to the liver may play a predominant noncell autonomous role in promoting gluconeogenesis.  Livers from PcxL−/− mice exhibit a dramatic increase in the abundance of lysine-acetylated proteins. The increase in N-acetylated amino acids, ketogenesis, and mitochondrial lysine-acetylated proteins all suggest an increase in matrix acetyl-CoA. Increased hepatocyte fatty acid oxidation is likely responsible as the lysine-acetylated proteins can be normalized by feeding PcxL−/− mice a ketogenic diet.",e137c97a-4c7f-4aeb-8dec-befa4b8681d0
29,discussion7," Although much has been written regarding the posttranslational regulation exerted by mitochondrial lysine acetylation, a more detailed analysis suggests that mitochondrial lysine acetylation/deacetylation plays a limited role in regulating mitochondrial energetics (25, 26, 27, 28, 29). There has been no definitive mitochondrial lysine acetyltransferase identified and the phenotypes of the major deacetylates have been inconsistent (29). The role of mitochondrial lysine acetylation is therefore not clear and may not play a protein and site-specific regulatory role as previously envisioned but may be an excellent indicator of long term mitochondrial metabolic state analogous to glycated hemoglobin.  Here, we have demonstrated the requirements of pyruvate carboxylase under disparate nutritional states. Pyruvate carboxylase represents a major pathway for mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism.",0df95906-446a-43e0-9b1a-9d94c46d03a3
30,discussion8," While the fate of pyruvate is unique among the fed and fasted states, pyruvate carboxylase contributes to both. While the loss of pyruvate carboxylase in the liver is tolerated during a 24 h fast and is protective for high fat–induced glucose intolerance, a ketogenic diet causes rapid metabolic decompensation. These data show the central requirement for hepatic pyruvate anaplerosis.  Experimental procedures  Pyruvate carboxylase (Pcx) transgenic mice were obtained from the European Mutant Mouse Archive (C57BL/6NTac-Pcx Tm1a) and bred to Flpe germline deleter mice (Jax #5705) to obtain mice with Pcx that contain a floxed exon 10. Genotyping primers for the floxed allele were forward, 5′-CACACTGGCCTAAAGCTTG-3′, and reverse, 5′- TTCCTGACTCCCTATGACAC-3’. The size of the amplified PCR product was 387 bp. These mice were then bred to Albumin-Cre mice to generate a hepatocyte-specific deletion of pyruvate carboxylase (PcxL−/−) and littermate controls (Pcxf/f).",282b7f71-a3bb-48a9-9a39-1afb3e2c715e
