0,background0,"Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA [1]. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)) accounts for 95% of all pancreatic cancer cases [2]. Despite advances in the understanding of pancreatic cancer biology, effective chemotherapeutic modalities for the treatment of patients remain to be developed. In addition to the aggressive pathogenesis, around 83% of pancreatic cancer patients demonstrate cancer-induced cachexia, which significantly contributes to cancer-related deaths [3]. Thus, inhibition of cachexia along with cancer cell growth may be an effective strategy for the management of pancreatic cancer.  Cachexia, a metabolic syndrome, leads to a loss of muscle weight and the depletion of fat deposits. Although an association of cachexia with various types of cancers has been known for a long time, the molecular mechanism of cancer-induced cachexia is poorly understood [4].",eb0d8601-4f76-48d3-83c7-6e9b4e208645
1,background1," Cachexia is triggered by a large number of tumor and host-derived catabolic factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNFα, and IFN-γ, which lead to changes in host metabolism and energy expenditure [4]. It has been proposed that excessive consumption of glucose by a growing tumor first leads to a depletion of glucose in the blood. At later stages of tumor growth, a depletion of glycogen stores in the liver occurs. Glycogen depletion is followed by muscle degradation and depletion of adipose deposits. All these account for the cachexia syndrome and result in a poor response to chemotherapy, fatigue, and a reduced quality of life for cancer patients [5].  Cancer cells exhibit reprogramming of several metabolic pathways along with multiple genetic, epigenetic, and growth signaling alterations [6,7].",d4d18935-a6ff-4242-b1c2-52c066103a8f
2,background2," Most cancer cells demonstrate an increase in glucose uptake, a higher rate of glycolysis, and an increase in lactate secretion despite the presence of oxygen, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect [8]. Aerobic glycolysis plays an important role in rapid cellular growth as it provides several intermediates required for biomass synthesis by routing the carbon flux through the pentose phosphate pathway [9]. The increased conversion of pyruvate into lactate by aerobic glycolysis leads to acidosis in tumor microenvironments that facilitates invasion and metastasis of cancer cells [10]. Aerobic glycolysis is also an energy-inefficient process requiring large amounts of glucose. Correspondingly, tumor cells serve as a glucose sink [11]. Additionally, lactate produced from tumor cells passes to the liver and gets converted to glucose by means of the Cori cycle, another energy-inefficient process [9].",ec1ed01a-a43f-41e5-927e-6488be102487
3,background3," Along with glucose uptake and enhanced aerobic glycolysis, cancer patients also present glucose intolerance and increased hepatic glucose production [12]. An increased requirement for glucose might be the critical stimulus needed for enhanced hepatic glucose production. Tumor cells also have alterations in the metabolism of glutamine, a nitrogen source and arguably the most significant metabolite precursor for tumor cells after glucose [13].  A ketogenic diet is a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet that leads to elevated circulating levels of ketone bodies (i.e., acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone) and an alternative energy source [14]. Ketogenic diets possess anticonvulsant and antiinflammatory activities [15,16]. It has also been proposed that a ketogenic diet treatment results in systemic metabolic changes like increased glucose tolerance, reduced fatty acid synthesis, and weight loss [17].",a1dbbf90-2d9b-4ec3-9285-6d9d6c7538c6
4,background4," Keeping in view the significant role of inflammation and metabolic alterations in cancer, a ketogenic diet may provide an efficient therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, most cancer cells lack key mitochondrial enzymes to metabolize ketone bodies and generate ATP, while myocytes and other tissues, including the brain, still retain this ability [18]. Hence, a ketogenic diet may act against the cancer-induced cachexia while causing minimal side effects as previously it has been shown that a 2–7-mM ketone body concentration can be achieved safely without giving rise to clinical acidosis [19,20]. In the present study, we have evaluated anticancerous and anticachectic properties of ketone bodies in cell culture conditions, as well as the effect of a ketogenic diet on tumor burden and cachexia in animal models. Furthermore, our studies establish a ketone body-induced metabolomic reprogramming as the mechanism of action of a ketogenic diet against cancer and cancer-induced cachexia.

In addition to chemical shifts, peak splitting patterns and peak shapes were also used to verify metabolite assignments.  The 2D 1H-13C hetero nuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR experiment is a more reliable approach for metabolite identification because of the significantly higher signal dispersion, and the correlation between 1H and 13C chemical shifts for each C-H pair in a molecule [35]. More importantly, the 2D 1H-13C hetero nuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiment simplifies the analysis of the metabolome because only compounds containing a 13C-carbon derived from the 13C6-glucose added to the media will be detected.

Each metabolite peak from the two sets (control and ketone body-treated) of triplicate 2D 1H-13C hetero nuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra were further normalized by using the maximum peak intensity for the metabolite and then scaled from 0 to 100. The peak intensities for each metabolite were then averaged and compared between the control and treated groups using a Student’s t test.

Because cancer cells demonstrate an increase in glycolysis [38], we examined the effect of ketone bodies on glucose uptake and lactate release in Capan1 and S2-013 cells. Treatment of Capan1 and S2-013 cells with ketone bodies resulted in a decrease in glucose uptake (Figure 2A,B) and release of lactate (Figure 2C,D) in a dose-dependent manner. Since glutamine also supports pancreatic cancer cell growth [7], we also evaluated the effect of ketone bodies on glutamine uptake.",924b2ffa-15d4-4c4c-bedf-a4be3432a81e

It has been shown that enhanced glucose uptake supports the production of intermediates required for biomass production in proliferating cancer cells.

Recent studies indicate that β-hydroxybutyrate, the main ketone body found in the body, reduces oxidative stress [49] and, in turn, functions as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Inhibition of histone deacetylase activity can suppress or prevent cancer growth as indicated by several studies with histone deacetylase inhibitors that are currently being evaluated for cancer prevention [50].  Most tumors are highly dependent on glucose as an energy source.

In transformed cells, c-Myc enhances the expression of glycolytic genes GLUT1, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and ENO1 as well as glutaminolytic genes such as GLS[53,54]. c-Myc is considered an attractive therapeutic target due to its role in modulating cell metabolism, tumor initiation, and growth in a variety of cancer types [53].",eaab9945-8922-4013-a9f8-5c6fec77f88d
62,discussion4," Hence, reduced c-Myc expression by ketone bodies might contribute to the growth inhibitory effects of ketone bodies in pancreatic cancer. Previously, it has been reported that c-Myc inhibition leads to regression of lung cancer [55], bladder cancer [56], and pancreatic cancer [57].  Cachexia affects a majority of pancreatic cancer patients and significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality [3]. However, agents targeting cachexia remain largely elusive. Metabolic adaptations in tumor cells are primarily responsible for the muscle weight loss and the depletion of adipose deposits associated with cachexia. Our study identifies ketone bodies as therapeutic agents that can diminish cancer cachexia by deactivating metabolic adaptations in cancer cells. Herein, we described cell culture-based models for investigating agents targeting cancer cachexia that is a corollary to our animal models of pancreatic cancer cachexia.",dcb1fa75-8045-46da-81cb-507076af2591
63,discussion5," Our results with the cell culture-based models indicate that ketone bodies significantly inhibit myotube degradation and adipolysis. We also observed a reduced expression of MuRF1, Atrogin, Zag, and HSL, which are signature genes associated with cachexia (Figure 5). Thus, ketone bodies inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth along with inhibition of pancreatic cancer-associated cachexia. Our NMR-based metabolomics studies indicate that treatments with ketone bodies significantly alter the metabolite flux in pancreatic cancer cells. We observed reduced cellular levels of glutamine, which is the most abundant amino acid and is involved in the regulation of growth and proliferation of cells. Cancer cell proliferation significantly depends on glutamine availability [13], and hence, the growth inhibitory effects of ketone bodies might in part be mediated by glutamine availability. Increased proline and lysine levels might play a role in growth inhibition of pancreatic cancer cells.",a4edcf78-ffe0-4f4e-aba8-c1fa9a3e1716
64,discussion6," Growth inhibitory effects of proline and lysine are known in bladder cancer cells [58]. We also observed an accumulation of the TCA metabolite citrate, which inhibits the phosphofructokinase enzyme in the glycolysis pathway and induces apoptosis in cancer cells [57]. Altogether, the metabolic shift after treatment of ketone bodies might significantly contribute to growth inhibition and apoptosis in cancer cells.  Although a link has been suggested between the metabolic needs of the growing tumor and cachexia syndrome, no studies have evaluated such a relationship. Our studies, for the first time, have confirmed that the metabolic requirements of growing tumor cells are directly responsible for the muscle degradation and lipolysis that are fundamental to the cachexia syndrome.",1930d01f-a6f5-4b3c-8903-552c39a2f264
65,discussion7," Our results indicate that the inhibition of either glucose uptake by GLUT1 knockdown or chemical inhibition of glycolysis by utilizing bromopyruvic acid (BPA) in cancer cells diminished myotube degradation and depletion of adipose deposits. Hence, our findings underscore the significance of tumor cell glucose metabolism in facilitating tumor-associated cachexia.  We observed increased concentration of ketone bodies in tumor cells in comparison to plasma; however, we did not explore any concentrative transport mechanisms. For in vitro studies, we utilized 10- and 20-mM concentrations of ketone bodies that are higher than physiological levels in plasma, but these are somewhat comparable to the concentrations in tumor cells in vivo (ranging from 0.85 to 7.84 mM; average 2.41 mM), in mice fed with a ketogenic diet. Furthermore, using similar concentrations, we observed no significant alteration in viability of non-transformed pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (Additional file 2).",34fb0c1f-8bad-4b22-a6dd-ad507a4d6534
66,discussion8," It indicates that the utilized doses do not affect non-cancer cell survival. In addition, our experiments indicate that ketone bodies do get metabolized in tumor cells that would further diminish actual concentration of ketone bodies in the tissues. The need for higher levels of ketone bodies in cell culture conditions to have biological efficacy might in part be due to higher glucose levels in the culture conditions (25 mM) than the physiological concentration (5.5 mM; even lower in tumor-bearing mice). Hence, if the effects of ketone bodies are simply due to decreased tumoral glucose levels, it is expected that the cell culture conditions would require higher doses. Regardless, the discrepancy in the levels of ketone bodies required to achieve the biological effects in culture conditions and in mice models reflects the inherent differences in the two experimental systems.  Diet is a key player in the progression and pathogenesis of cancer.",75aa2dc6-fe94-4cee-bbf2-0fc788205243
67,discussion9," While high-calorie and high-fat diets are associated with increased incidence of cancer [59], several epidemiological studies have demonstrated a direct relationship between low-sugar diet and a lower incidence of cancer [60]. Our study indicates a reduced tumor growth and tumor weight, along with a reduced proliferation of tumor cells in tumor-bearing mice that were subjected to a ketogenic diet relative to regular chow. Overall, along with a reduced tumor burden, the ketogenic diet also improved muscle mass and body weight in tumor-bearing mice. Hence, a ketogenic diet may serve as an anticancer agent as well as an anticachectic agent.  Conclusions Metabolic alterations, being a hallmark of cancer, can be utilized to target different aspects of tumor growth or associated phenotypes. Cancer cachexia is associated with significant mortality in pancreatic cancer patients.",8daff916-3a0d-4985-bcee-7d4d41fd0d36
68,discussion10," In the present study, we investigated a novel systemic approach to modulate pancreatic cancer cell metabolism for diminishing tumor cell survival and ameliorating cancer cachexia. We have demonstrated anticancerous and anticachectic properties of ketone bodies in cell culture conditions, as well as the effect of a ketogenic diet on tumor burden and cachexia in animal models. Furthermore, our studies establish a ketone body-induced metabolomics reprogramming as the mechanism of action of a ketogenic diet against cancer and cancer-induced cachexia.",9c0bca4c-3c85-41d8-99d4-f9f8667f3f63
