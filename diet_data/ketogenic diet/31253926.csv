XXVIII. Section 243/1998) and the regulations for animal experimentation in the European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC) guidelines were followed during the experimental procedures. Experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Experimentation Committee of the Eötvös Loránd University (Savaria University Centre) and by the National Scientific Ethical Committee on Animal Experimentation (Hungary) under license number VA/ÉBNTF02/85–8/2016. We made all efforts to reduce the number of animals used.  2.2. Ketogenic Compounds Ad libitum access to water and standard rodent chow (standard diet: SD, NIH-31 Rodent Chow; Envigo), or ketogenic rodent food (KD; TD.",7b166ab0-0cde-4a55-b3c4-b9d7e1a07c0a
2,methods2," 10911; Envigo), or SD with ketone supplements (Table 1, and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) were provided for the animals. The KD used in this study was modified from TD.10787 (Teklad) to remove maltodextrin to make the diet essentially free of carbohydrate. The KD had a 2:1 ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids and a 1.5:1 ratio of fat to protein + carbohydrate. Compared to TD.10787 (common KD formula), TD.10911 had the same % fat (wt/wt), but it had a higher % kcal from fat, because maltodextrin was removed and replaced with cellulose. KE (R,S 1,3-butanediol-acetoacetate diester) was synthesized by D’Agostino, 2013, as previously described [17]. The KS (Na+/K+– R,S βHB mineral salt) was mixed into a 50% solution supplying approximately 375 mg/g of pure βHB and 125 mg/g of Na+/K+ in a 1:1 ratio.

3,methods3," Human food-grade medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil (~60% caprylic triglyceride/40% capric triglyceride, Now Foods, Bloomingdale, IL, USA) was used for the experiments. KS and KE were mixed with medium chain triglyceride (MCT) in a 1:1 ratio, resulting the KSmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) and KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) combinations, respectively. KE was mixed with KS in a 1:1 ratio to make KEKS. R,S-1,3-butanediol (BD) was purchased from Sigma (Milwaukee, WI, USA).  2.3. Exposure Schedule For the trials involving Sprague Dawley (SPD) and WR rats, intragastric delivery by oral gavage was used. To acclimatize the rodents, each animal was orally gavaged with water for five days prior to treatment (Figure 1).",d6df2bbb-bdb9-441d-bd3c-1ebc5e2ee3ef
4,methods4," After acclimatization and baseline measurements (5th days), the rats were orally gavaged either once with different exogenous ketone supplements (acute treatment on the 6th day; 5 g/kg for Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats) and the effects (motor function and blood measurements) were measured after 30 min−1 h, or they were gavaged once daily for 7 days (subchronic treatment between 6th and 12th day; 5 g/kg/day for Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats and 2.5 g/kg/day for WR rats) and the effects were recorded after 24 h and after 7 days (Figure 1). In relation to G1D mice with chronic exposure, ketone supplements were administered daily for 10 weeks and the effects were measured after 3, 6, and 10 weeks treatment (Figure 1).  2.4. Treatment Groups One-year-old Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats were divided into 6 groups for the acute treatment and were fed with SD and they were administered a single oral gavage.",ecbb94a4-e0a3-4755-ac0c-9254e5a04736

Motor performance was evaluated prior to the beginning of dietary treatment (baseline; 5th day of habituation) and 30 min after gavage.  Subchronic experiments used 4-month old Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats that were divided into 5 groups and fed with either SD, KD and supplemented with a once-daily oral gavage for 7 days. Treatment groups included control (SD, water gavage, n = 11), KD (n = 10), KE (n = 9), KS (n = 9), and KSmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) (n = 10).

Rotarod test was carried out similarly to subchronically treated Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats.  The G1D mice exposed to chronic treatment were split into four groups, SD (control; n = 12), KD (n = 12), or the SD supplemented with KS (n = 12) or KE (n = 12) and were treated for 10 weeks. Rotarod test was performed before the beginning of dietary treatment (baseline) and after 3, 6, and 10 weeks of treatment.  2.5. Motor Performance Testing Motor performance was evaluated using the accelerating rotarod test on a RotaRod Rotamex 5 (rotarod; Columbus Inst., Columbus, OH, USA). The rats were placed on the rods of the accelerating rotarod, and the time the animals remained on the rod was measured. The rotarod was set to accelerate from zero to 40 rpm in 180 s.",90327630-cb60-4fcf-a8e0-1f2ecfa4a505
7,methods7," To acclimate the animals to both the equipment and the task, prior to the administration of a test, animals were trained on the rotarod for 5 consecutive days. Thus, habituation to rotarod test was parallel with habituation to oral gavage (Figure 1). Each day of training consisted of 3 sessions, with a 120 s rest period between trials. Animals were placed on the rotarod and timed until they fell from the rotating rod. Following last trial, the blood measurements were collected within 10 min.  2.6. Blood Glucose and R-βHB Whole blood (~10 μL) was acquired from saphenous vein (rats) and tail vein (mice) for analysis of blood glucose (mg/dL) and R-βHB (mmol/L) with Precision XtraTM (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). Note that the Precision XtraTM measures R-βHB exclusively—not S-βHB, AcAc, or Acetone—therefore, total ketone level may be somewhat underrepresented.

8,methods8," While R-βHB is the normal product of human and mouse metabolism, it is metabolized much faster than S-βHB is. S-βHB is not a normal product of human metabolism, however, it is a transient intermediate of β-oxidation of fatty acids, therefore, administration of the same amount of S-βHB may lead to higher level and more sustained blood levels of S-βHB, compared to similar administration of R-βHB [42]. Blood was drawn prior to the beginning of the treatments (5th day of habituation), and this value was used as the established baseline. Treatment-generated changes in glucose and R-βHB were measured (60 min) after the beginning of treatment (acute treatments, Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats). Blood was drawn after treatment started, at either 1 h, 24 h, or after 7 daily treatments (subchronic treatments, Sprague Dawley (SPD), and/or WR rats). During chronic treatments (G1D mice), blood was drawn before treatment started (baseline) and at week 3, 6, and 10 after beginning treatment.  2.7.",82b84baa-a1f3-43aa-aa69-2a92eecdcc55

Discussion In this study, we demonstrated the effect of KD and various exogenous ketone formulations on motor performance in different rodent models with (WR rats and G1D mice) and without (Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats) pathology after acute, subchronic, or chronic exposures. We reported improvement of motor performance by ketone supplementation, which may depend on the strain of rodents, specific ketone formulation, age, species, and exposure frequency. Moreover, we reported significant changes in blood R-βHB and glucose levels after exercise. Previous experiments have demonstrated that ketogenic diets significantly improved motor function in studies on AD, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), HD, PD, stroke, and MS disease models [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,33].",d7c59ce1-e819-4c45-a9f2-29474222b13a
17,methods18," Our experiments expand upon these previous studies by reporting about the positive effect of exogenous ketone supplementation on motor performance in nonpathological and additional pathological rodent models.  Ketone-based therapies were found to be effective in the treatment of a variety of diseases, including neurological pathologies with motor dysfunction [2,8,25,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54]. For example, in patients with PD nutritional ketosis decreased neuron degeneration, reduced mitochondrial damage, improved motor outcomes, and reduced proinflammatory cytokine levels [1,4,43,44,45,46]. Application of nutritional ketosis attenuated motor dysfunction in mouse models of HD [47]. Ketone-based therapies were reported effective in improving motor function in a model animal of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (SOD1-G93A transgenic mice) through neuroprotective outcomes [2,35].",72f5ab51-5d5e-4c23-9662-02bf281a51ba
18,methods19," Moreover, in a study on G1D mice (characterized by impaired glucose transportation and motor dysfunction), adherence of a KD improved motor symptoms [41]. Our results demonstrated that exogenous ketone supplement can improve motor dysfunction in G1D mice. While several therapeutic mechanisms for the KD have been explored, its role in disease pathologies is relatively unknown and further research into the physiological and mechanistic effect of ketone-based therapeutics is warranted [1]. It has been demonstrated that exogenous ketone supplementation is a viable and safe method in various animal models of, for example, central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)) diseases and in human central nervous system (CNS) disorders when alternative ketone-based therapies are needed that address the limitations with KD [1,14,17,19,31].",e1cc897c-b769-46d8-9b9b-d26010f4aff9
19,methods20,"  We report that the motor performance may improve with KD in disease context, but also with exogenous ketone supplementation even in rodents eating a standard, carbohydrate-rich diet, suggesting that ketone supplementation may be a viable alternative for those unwilling or unable to adhere to a KD. Our data supports that exogenous ketone supplementation was more efficient in improving motor performance than KD, as KD reduced motor performance in Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats after 24 h and 7 days (Figure 3A), although the effect was not significant when assessing % change (Figure 3B). On the other hand, exogenous ketones showed more consistent improvement throughout different model systems, illustrating a potentially more translatable therapeutic tool across healthy and disease context.",438d8515-9aa5-4769-87da-cd80b8ffd4b1
20,methods21,"  While our previous study showed that ketone supplementation lowered blood glucose levels [27] in the nonexercised state, we found that in the postexercise state it was elevated at 1 h (Figure 2D), possibly due to exercise augmenting glycogenolysis induced glucose elevation which may offset the blood glucose lowering effect. However, in some cases in Sprague Dawley (SPD) and WR rats after 1 h and 7 days the blood glucose levels were lower than control and baseline (Figure 2D, Figure 3D and Figure 4D) and in G1D mice after 6 weeks it was lower than baseline (Figure 5D), suggesting that exogenous ketones may be able to offset the glycogenolysis induced glucose elevation in postexercised state. It has been suggested that alleviating effects of ketone-based therapies, such as KD on motor performance, likely results from carbohydrate restriction (and low glucose levels), but not from increased blood βHB levels [48,49].",6571b5f3-e0a9-455d-8f6a-d6ceae94d777
21,methods22," However, based on our results it is unclear whether KD- and ketone supplements- evoked alterations in blood glucose level had a major influencing factor on motor performance. For example, both KD and KE decreased blood glucose level at 24 h (Figure 3D), but only KE improved motor performance of Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats.  Many different beneficial effects on diseases have been linked to ketone therapies and this is likely due to the resulting decreased production of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), improved mitochondrial function, reduction in inflammation, neuroprotective effects, and increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) [1,50,51,52]. Additionally, ketones have been found to produce changes in post-translational modification of proteins and histone acetylation [53,54,55].",8d4536c0-5c24-4e15-8be3-7c2365a41fb7
22,methods23," It has also been reported that ketones may enhance learning in multiple rodent models and may explain the motor performance increase observed in the nonpathological mouse models [56]. Furthermore, ketones may enhance muscle performance or central nervous system (CNS) control of muscle contractions/coordination, which could be a contributing factor to the rodent’s ability to remain on the rotarod longer, not only in rodents with motor dysfunction, but also rodents without motor impairment, such as Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats and WR rats.  Ketogenic diet and exogenous ketone supplementation may also act on cellular homeostasis through various signaling pathways, such as mTOR, activated protein kinase (AMPK), and neurotransmitter systems. Ketosis has been shown to affect cell proliferation, energetic metabolism, protein biosynthesis, and attenuate muscle wasting [57,58,59,60,61,62].",18ad46e6-da7d-4319-8049-388a20ab7d53
23,methods24," KD acts upon specific tyrosine kinase receptors for insulin and insulin growth factor (insulin growth factor (IGF)) and upregulates the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). This is counteracted by a lower intracellular ATP/AMP ratio and the subsequent upregulation of liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) signaling, which then inhibits the mTORC1 pathway [48,53]. Research also suggests that ketone-based therapies likely have additional therapeutic applications by reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), attenuation of skeletal muscle catabolism, and various neuroprotective effects [15,50,51,62,63]. Moreover, it was also suggested that KD- and exogenous ketone supplements-evoked alleviating effects on different central nervous system (CNS) diseases may be modulated by different neurotransmitter/neuromodulator systems, such as GABAergic (e.g.",6244a1e7-db14-4921-8ccd-c76b8ff8656c
24,methods25,", by increased GABA level) and purinergic/adenosinergic (e.g., via increased adenosine concentration) systems [19,31,64,65,66,67]. Therefore, studies about the application of ketone metabolic therapies for various neurological conditions suggest that multifactorial mechanisms play a role in improving motor function (e.g., mitochondrial function, neurotransmitter systems, anti-inflammatory processes, and skeletal muscle physiology), but further research is required to fully elucidate pathways and potential therapeutic applications.  While no motor function impairments (motor dysfunction) have been demonstrated in Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats and WR rats [39,40], the subchronically administered ketone supplement KE, KS (in Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats), KEKS and KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) (in WR rats) improved motor performance.",429e5dbf-6855-4488-a02b-5fd2f93e558e
25,methods26," These results suggest that exogenous ketone supplements may improve motor performance not only in animal models with neurometabolic pathology, such as motor dysfunction (e.g., G1D mice), but also in animals without pathology (e.g., Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats) or with pathology, but without motor dysfunction (e.g., WR rats), likely by enhanced learning and muscle performance [5,44,56,68]. Moreover, exogenous ketone supplements-evoked effects on motor performance may be rat strain dependent. Indeed, it was demonstrated that influences of KD and ketone supplements may be modulated by strain-, age-, and species-dependent changes. For example, it has been demonstrated that expression of monocarboxylate class type 1 transporter on the bodies cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) may be not only age-, but also species-dependent [69,70,71]. In addition, age- and species-dependent changes in activity of βHB metabolizing enzymes were also demonstrated [39,40,72,73,74,75].",742ff014-1d00-4be1-9a9d-cb243b63e110
26,methods27," It has been revealed that level, uptake, metabolism, as well as utilization, and consequently, effects of ketone bodies may be regionally different in the brain areas implicated not only in physiological, but also in pathophysiological processes in different strains [72,76,77,78]. All of these factors may result in brain area-, age-, strain-, and species-dependent influences/effectivity of KD and ketone supplements on motor performance in different animal models. Consequently, efficacy of treatments may also be dependent on the various type of ketone supplements (e.g., KSmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) decreased whereas KEKS and KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) increased the motor performance in WR rats), on the exposure frequency/time after administration (e.g., acute treatment by KE was not effective on motor performance, but subchronic administration of KE improved the motor performance in Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats) and on the interference of different factors.",aed195fa-a97a-422b-9f8e-94271b9490f7
27,methods28,"  Limitations and Inconsistencies One limitation of these results is that we used racemic (R/S) βHB exclusively, because this was the most economical and commercially available product on the market for both experimental purposes and for consumer consumption at the time of the study. Racemic βHB has been used clinically in patients and consumers for years [79], and no serious adverse events from βHB supplement ingestion have been reported (CAERS open-FDA database), even with >1 million estimated servings consumed annually. Thus, our approach was to evaluate molecules, which may be economically feasible to translate to humans and would be accessible to end-users in the near future. However, one consideration with racemic βHB supplements is the potential differences in metabolism of S- βHB and R- βHB, although existing data on this is still limited.",30cb706a-d0b6-4d49-b12a-ac3e6d461c28
28,methods29," Based on previous studies we know that S- βHB and R- βHB from racemic mixtures are naturally metabolized in rats and humans [80], but S-βHB remains elevated in the blood longer after consumption of racemic mixtures. It appears that ketolytic metabolism favors a more rapid catabolism of R- βHB, the predominant form of βHB that is produced endogenously. It is possible that the rate limiting enzymes for S-βHB conversion to acetyl CoA (e.g., S-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase) may be in lower quantities since endogenous levels are much lower. Although previous studies suggest that the enzymatic kinetics of S- βHB metabolism is slower, this does not appear to be the case in the rat liver, at least with S-1,3-butanediol. Of potential relevance to our results is the observation that S-1,3-butanediol, a specific S- βHB precursor, has a greater blood glucose lowering effect [81], which could conceivably influence motor function performance.",7c19096a-2433-4cd0-9669-47e87ca33fb2
29,methods30," These previous metabolic observations need to be considered when interpreting our data and designing future experiments that test enantiomerically pure forms of both βHB isomers in physiological testing.  Considering these limitations, we can speculate that R-βHB levels may be an important factor in KD/exogenous ketone supplement-evoked positive effects on motor performance, but other factors likely have a modulatory role. Since we could not unambiguously correlate elevated R-βHB levels with augmented motor performance, future dose-response studies can help to identify the optimal range for this specific application. It is also possible that other forms of ketone molecules contributed to the performance enhancing effect that were not directly measured in the present study, but previous studies show their elevation (e.g., KE will elevate acetoacetate levels as well, which was not directly measured here, but may have contributed to the performance enhancing effect, see Figure 5B,C).",eafdb512-361a-49bc-9ed3-afad1de4db8f
30,methods31," For example, acute KSmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) and KEKS treatment significantly increased the blood R-βHB level at 1 h, but did not augment motor performance (latency to fall), whereas KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) treatment enhanced R-βHB concentration to a lesser degree (compared to KSmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) and KEKS), but significantly increased latency to fall, compared to baseline in one year old Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats (Figure 2). Acetoacetate, from KE, may have contributed to the performance enhancing effect here as well, which may have increased efficacy for this application when working synergistically with medium chain triglyceride (MCT) rather than with KS. In regards to KD treatment, we observed increased blood R-βHB at 24 h and 7 days, but this treatment significantly decreased the latency to fall from rotarod, compared to baseline in 4-months-old Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats (Figure 3).",f77705f9-e8a2-4c72-b140-dcaf3b363308
31,methods32," It is likely that adaptation (which takes weeks to months) to the KD confers additional beneficial effects, so this outcome was not unexpected after only 24 h and even 7 days, as we would expect to see ketoadaptation and its beneficial effects over longer timeframe. KE treatment significantly increased blood R-βHB level only at 24 h, but improved motor function at both 24 h and 7 days, compared to baseline (24 h and 7 days), and control (at 7 days). KS treatment did not increase blood R-βHB levels at 24 h, however this treatment significantly improved motor function, compared to both control and baseline (Figure 3). It is conceivable that low R-βHB at 24 h is indicative of tissue utilization, leading augmentation of muscle tissue performance.",37835e63-1011-43ce-a362-33520912a417
32,methods33," Moreover, KSmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) treatment increased blood R-βHB concentration to high levels at 7 days more than any other treatment, but it did not show a motor performance improving effect (Figure 3), suggesting that higher R-βHB levels may not be as beneficial, or that medium chain triglyceride (MCT) may be negating the performance benefits (perhaps by reducing R-βHB metabolism). Subchronic treatment of WR rats by KE and KSmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) increased blood R-βHB levels at 1 h and at 7 days, but did not improve motor performance (Figure 4), again suggesting that higher R-βHB levels might not be optimal in this context. Chronic KE treatment improved motor performance at week 3 and week 6 in G1D mice, but blood R-βHB levels were not changed by KE treatment at these time points (Figure 5). Therefore, it is possible that other ketone bodies, such as acetoacetate may contribute to the performance enhancing effect that was associated with chronic KE treatment.",32f37761-4840-4c95-b44a-ae5ebabd65c0
33,methods34," Based on these results, we can speculate that a particular range of R-βHB level may be needed to improve motor function, and this may be age-, strain-, and species dependent. It is possible that higher levels of acute (or subchronic) ketosis may induce a mild metabolic acidosis (lower pH), and this could conceivably blunt performance effects. Moreover, other contributing factors should also be considered, e.g., different ketone-based therapies evoke direct and indirect influences on neurotransmission, cell energetics, muscle and nerve regeneration, as well as gastric hormone levels (e.g., ghrelin, which is in connection with muscular trophism) [48,82,83], other modulatory effects, such as mobilization of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs),which can directly modulate ion channel functioning [84,85], and elevated neurosteroid synthesis resulting in modulation of GABAA receptors [86,87].",ebab9144-fcb9-4db9-ab61-241b7ac645b8
34,methods35," These and other, yet unidentified factors may influence the modulatory role of KD/ketone supplements on physiological and pathophysiological processes, as well as central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Thus, our results suggest that KD/ketone supplements may be effective to improve motor function in different physiological and pathophysiological conditions by affecting multiple organs.  Given these inconsistencies we need to point out the following: (i) we could not make definitive conclusion about direct correlation between motor performance and R-βHB levels; (ii) our experimental design did not mechanistically elucidate the contributing role of acetoacetate (and perhaps acetone) in augmenting motor performance; (iii) these data do not clarify if ketone supplementation augments performance via enhancing muscular cellular energetics or through some yet to be identified ketone-induced signaling/neuropharmacological change,",4d553fde-2695-4b92-83d6-b20df1ff1e9a
35,methods36," potentially influencing central nervous system (CNS)-control of motor performance. However, we can conclude that (i) positive effects of exogenous ketone supplementation were identified on motor performance in nonpathological and pathological states; (ii) exogenous ketones may be able to offset the glycogenolysis induced glucose elevation in postexercised state; (iii) exogenous ketones may have a specific therapeutic range for various applications; (iv) different forms and formulations can have different effects independently from the level of blood βHB elevation.",e9fd3472-b795-41c2-b50a-672243ea0ac0
36,methods37,"  In order to address these remaining questions, future experiments will need to focus on: (1) More direct comparisons of the physiological effects between racemic and enantiomerically pure βHB substances; (2) Comprehensively evaluate the dose-dependent effects of both racemic and enantiomerically purified forms of βHB; (3) Investigate acetoacetate-specific effects; (4) Monitoring correlations between blood glucose lowering effect and motor performance; (5) Conduct additional tests focusing on potential differences in efficacy between various motor functions, e.g., endurance, fine motor control, strength, balance; (6) Mechanistically isolate R-βHB signaling effects from ketone-induced changes in cellular energetics and metabolic control, especially focusing on signaling effects that can influence motor performance; (7) Detailed investigation of agent-specific mechanism on not only the brain, but also on other organs (e.g.",a048c801-888c-4043-9aca-b225e26ebf79
37,methods38,", heart, skeletal muscle, lungs, and liver); (8) Develop and identify optimal ketone formulations (e.g., types, doses, exposure frequency vs. age) to alleviate motor dysfunction in patients with different physiological and pathological conditions.  In light of these inconsistencies in the data we would like to caution end-users to avoid making generalizations about the use of ketone supplements in different contexts and we call to direct more attention to the differences between various forms (racemic and enantiomerically pure) and formulations (combined agents) and their potential positive, negative, or synergistic effect.  5. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the effects of the KD and ketone supplementation on motor performance in Sprague Dawley (SPD), and WR rats, as well as in G1D mice after acute, subchronic, or chronic administration.",2f639a6c-77c9-4a9c-b627-437dab7b0867
38,methods39," We observed that motor performance improved significantly in various pathological and nonpathological rodent models for different exposure schedules and that the effectiveness of the supplements differed according to rodent strain, the schedule of treatment, the specific supplement they were exposed to, and age of the rodents. We found that exogenous ketone supplementation was more efficient in improving motor performance than KD. While KD treatment led to mixed results—demonstrating more efficacy in disease context (G1D)—exogenous ketones showed consistent effect across disease and nondisease states. Furthermore, in certain scenarios, exogenous ketone supplements offset the glycogenolysis-induced glucose elevation in the postexercise state, which might be beneficial when there is a need to keep blood glucose levels low even after exercising.",7a9270aa-79e0-4654-864d-43e3db754cf5
39,methods40," These results also strengthen previous research on the potential of ketone therapies and their ability to improve motor performance in a variety of pathological and nonpathological rodent models. The differences in the efficacy of a given formulation are potentially due to differences in neuronal ketone metabolism between the different rodent strains and species, hepatic metabolism (ketogenesis), or variabilities in skeletal muscle metabolism. However, further studies are needed to explore the safe and effective therapeutic applications of ketone-based therapies and elucidate their exact mechanisms of action on motor performance.
