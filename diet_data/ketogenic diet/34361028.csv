0,discussion0," Here we present 3 cases of normal-weight adults who experienced profound elevations in LDL-C level in response to a KD, with little to no change in trigylceride or glucose levels. In all cases, LDL-C level improved after cessation of the diet. In Case 3, just 2 months after stopping the KD, LDL-C level decreased by 40%. Likewise, in Case 2, 7 months after stopping the KD, LDL-C level had plummeted by 79%, a far greater drop than expected from medications alone.  Low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets have been used for the purposes of weight loss for decades. Recently, the KD, a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet, has become widely popular for not just those wanting to lose weight, but also healthy normal-weight people. Restricting carbohydrates generally results in a high consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol. A causal link has been established between saturated-fat intake and LDL-C levels, and elevated LDL-C is a well-established risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis.",d6806415-1c97-4b6c-8475-4b89bdc0bd6b
1,discussion1," In the literature, data are conflicting regarding LDL-C-level response to KDs. Some of the differences observed in the trials on effects on LDL-C level may reflect variations in carbohydrate and fat quantity and quality in the individual dietary interventions, differences in adherence, and differing amounts of weight loss, a factor that can itself result in lowering LDL-C level.  A study by Retterstøl et al. of young, normal-weight adults noted an average increase in LDL-C of 44% after 3 weeks of following a KD, compared with control patients, who had marked interindividual variation (5% to 107% increase in LDL-C).3 Another case series by Goldberg et al.4 included genetic testing on 4 patients who had large increases in LDL-C while on a KD. One person had an APOE E2/E2 genotype, 2 had a higher burden of common genetic polymorphisms that contribute to hyperlipidemia, and 1 did not have any identified genetic contributors.",d8bf08f2-ec1b-4b91-aec0-1bc152ced20c
2,discussion2," KDs are also high in cholesterol, in part dependent on egg-yolk consumption. As we reported previously, consumption of 3 eggs per day by young healthy men under controlled dietary conditions resulted in a mean 21.2% increase in LDL-C, with individual increases ranging from 0% to 62%.5  A point of note is that the 3 individuals described here were of normal body weight and did not experience weight loss. Thus, the composition of fatty acids reaching the liver reflected largely that of dietary intake. In contrast, during weight loss, as in obese individuals consuming a KD diet, a substantial contribution of fatty acids is derived from adipose tissue lipolysis, such that the proportion of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids available for hepatic metabolism is lower than it is during weight maintenance. This fact may account for the attenuated increase in LDL-C that occurs when a KD diet is prescribed for weight loss.",639bdf5e-0deb-467e-91fa-0d2ad260a9fd
3,discussion3,"  Multiple common genetic variants in genes encoding apolipoproteins and cholesterol transporters have been linked to interindividual responses to changes in dietary fat content and composition and cholesterol intake.6 The hepatic response to saturated fat intake is mediated through sterol-responsive element binding protein (sterol responsive element binding protein (SREBP)), with downstream effects on lipogenic enzyme activity and LDL receptor number.7 In the Retterstøl study,3 participants in the low-carbohydrate group demonstrated a 30% decrease in LDL receptor expression compared to baseline.  In conclusion, the KD can be an effective diet for weight loss and may improve the glycemic variables and plasma triglycerides in obese individuals. As shown here, recognizing that a KD can elicit an extreme elevation in LDL-C level, particularly in lean, weight-stable individuals, is important.",939854e3-5419-45f8-881e-a1cfb8e52910
4,discussion4," Per the American Heart Association guidelines, an optimal diet for cardiovascular disease prevention is one low in saturated fat and cholesterol, with inclusion of appropriate sources of polyunsaturated and monosaturated fats.8Novel Teaching Points  • A KD can result in marked increases in LDL-C, particularly in lean, weight-stable individuals.  • A complex interplay of genetic factors may contribute to the variability of interindividual response to dietary saturated fat and cholesterol.  • Although a KD may have a role in eliciting short-term weight loss and improved glycemic control in obese individuals, it should not be recommended for weight maintenance.
