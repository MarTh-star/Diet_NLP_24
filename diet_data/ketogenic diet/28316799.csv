22,results9," Children epileptic encephalopathy is the cerebral disease with the main clinical characteristics of frequent seizures of epilepsy, progressive neurological decay, interictal electroencephalogram (effect compliance adverse reactions electroencephalogram (EEG)) persistent epileptic discharge, difficult in the treatment with traditional antiepileptic drugs, and poor prognosis, and it is called pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy in children. At present, the treatment of pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy in children is new antiepileptic drug therapy, surgery, vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketogenic diet (KD), etc. KD therapy for the treatment of pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy in children at home and abroad has achieved a certain curative effect. KD is a high proportion of fat, low carbohydrate, adequate protein diet program, and the body supply energy mainly rely on fat instead of carbohydrates.",1d917655-1ba6-4282-8991-1e2e0b526c1b
23,results10," By simulating hunger state, the ketone body in its fat metabolism progress can be used as another kind if energy supply source, can generate antiepileptic effect. KD was first reported by Wilder in 1921, it confirmed that KD has an exact curative effect in the treatment of refractory epilepsy. At present, more than 70 countries around the world have carried out KD therapy, and most of epilepsy center in the United States make KD as one of the conventional treatment methods for refractory epilepsy (Kossoff & McGrogan, 2005). In China, KD has gradually carried out for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. In this study, we summarized the effect of KD in the treatment of children with refractory epilepsy, as well as the compliance, adverse reactions, effect compliance adverse reactions electroencephalogram (EEG), and its impact on cognition.  2 ",abffd813-3ac4-4ee0-b53f-f42497fa1d6e
24,discussion0," Epileptic encephalopathy has a poor response to antiepileptic drugs, and is thus considered to be pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy, which accounts for 20%–30% of epilepsy cases. Although antiepileptic drugs continue to be developed, the incidence of epileptic encephalopathy has not changed. With the exception of antiepileptic drugs for the treatment of pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy in children, the treatment methods include KD, surgery, and vagus nerve stimulation therapy. As a result of the low cost of treatment, low risk, and definite curative effect, KD therapy was widely used domestically and internationally before antiepileptic drugs were available. At present, KD therapy and related treatment methods have been shown to be effective in the treatment of pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy in children (Winesett, Bessone, & Kossoff, 2015).",aaf2b303-cd5b-4999-9403-23b187bc444b
25,discussion1," The international guidelines for the treatment of pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy in children by KD were published in 2009, and the updated paper published by the International Union Against Epilepsy in 2015 indicated that KD is a safe and effective method for the treatment of pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy in children (van der Louw et al., 2016).  The antiepileptic mechanism underlying KD is unclear, yet the use of ketones as the major source of energy in the brain and calorie restriction appears to be important for the effects of KD (Masino & Rho, 2012). From a historical point of view, the mechanism of action of KD is considered to be the antiepileptic effect of ketones because the production of ketones is a significant feature of the diet. The ketones produced by KD include three species (acetoacetate, acetone, and beta‐hydroxybutyrate [BHB]).",81bbb71e-def9-4954-b4e2-300656646ca6
26,discussion2," Acetoacetate and acetone have an antiepileptic effect in a variety of acute exacerbation rat models, but BHB does not show antiepileptic effects. It is surprising that the level of BHB is often clinically associated with the control of epilepsy in children. Recent studies using different levels of ketones, and experiments have shown that there is insufficient evidence to prove that the efficacy of KD is derived from the antiepileptic effect of ketones. In addition, the level of ketones does not correspond with the antiepileptic effect (Masino & Rho, 2012). Another study showed that ketones do not have an effect on the main ion channels (GABA A, ionotropic glutamate receptor, or the voltage‐gated sodium channels [the antiepileptic drugs are commonly used as a target for this ion channel]) (Thio, Wong, & Yamada, 2000). Existing evidence suggests that BHB can reduce the degradation of GABA, and increase the concentration of inhibitory neurotransmitters (Suzuki et al., 2009).",a36d69d1-cc5b-4dcc-b731-48ea0ff0ca2f
27,discussion3," Interestingly, low glycemic index treatment, as a variant of the KD, does not require high levels of blood ketones to achieve the desired effect. In addition, glucose pathway inhibitors also have antiepileptic effects, suggesting that calorie restriction and reduced glucose availability may be an important mechanism underlying the antiepileptic effect of KD (Stafstrom et al., 2009). Although the mechanism of action underlying KD is complex, the efficacy of KD is broader than most of the anticonvulsant drugs. In this context, “metabolic‐based treatment” could be a new class of anticonvulsant therapy (Kossoff, Zupec‐Kania, & Rho, 2009), and a study on the mechanism underlying KD has potential benefits for children. Bough, Valiyil, Han, and Eagles (1999)) found that the efficacy of KD is age‐dependent; thus, the younger the children, the more significant the antiepileptic effect. Therefore, KD is mainly used in pediatrics.",e38cc614-4497-478f-9323-e491b7d66696
28,discussion4,"  KD had a good effect on a variety of seizures (Beniczky, Jose Miranda, Alving, Heber Povlsen, & Wolf, 2010; Hallböök, Köhler, Rosén, & Lundgren, 2007; Henderson, 2006; Keene, 2006; Remahl, Dahlin, & Amark, 2008), and KD has been shown to reduce seizure occurrence by 50%, with some children achieving complete control (Winesett et al., 2015). Studies have shown that KD has varying degrees of effectiveness for infantile spasms (Hong, Turner, Hamdy, & Kossoff, 2010), Dravet syndrome (Laux & Blackford, 2013), and Doose syndrome (Bergqvist, 2012), and is relatively effective on infantile spasms. This result provided a good theoretical basis for this study. Kossoff, Zupec‐Kania, & Amark, et al. (2009) suggested that KD has special effects on some epilepsy syndromes, such as myoclonic‐atonic epilepsy, Dravet syndrome, and West syndrome (especially combined with tuberous sclerosis). Others have observed that a KD has a significant effect on Dravet and Doose syndromes. Caraballo et al.",15739d03-e9e1-45a5-9a40-83e7467fb26c
29,discussion5," (2006) reported the results of KD therapy in 11 patients with refractory myoclonic‐astatic epilepsy. Two patients (2/11) were seizure‐free, 2 (2/11) had a 75%–99% decrease in seizures, and the remaining 2 children (2/11) had a 50%–74% decrease in seizures (Caraballo et al., 2006). Greater than one‐half of children had a 50% reduction in seizures, with a significant proportion of those having no seizures (Caraballo et al., 2006; Kilaru & Bergqvist, 2007; Korff et al., 2007). It can be concluded that KD has gradually been recognized as beneficial in the treatment of Dravet syndrome, West syndrome, and Doose syndrome. The results of this study showed that the efficiency of KD increased with time. In all, 52 children with epileptic encephalopathy were treated with KD for at least 12 weeks; 41 children were treated for 24 weeks, and 29 children were treated for 48 weeks.",8ba190bc-deeb-4c58-ba0c-fe12167049d4
30,discussion6," Complete control of seizures occurred in 12 patients, and the number of seizures in 29 patients was reduced by >50%; KD was shown to be effective within 2 weeks of beginning treatment. At 12 weeks of KD treatment, among 52 children, Engel I grade accounted for 26.9% (14/52), Engel II grade accounted for 17.3% (9/52), Engel III grade accounted for 11.5% (6/52), and Engel IV grade accounted for 44.2% (23/52). When treated for 12 weeks, different epilepsy syndromes respond differently to KD. Doose syndrome has the best response to KD, but due to the small number of cases, the efficacy needs further evaluation. Infantile spasms respond better to KD; 11 of 38 children had no seizures, and the seizure activity of 57.9% (22/38) children was decreased by >50%. KD also had a good therapeutic effect in the treatment of Dravet syndrome. During the treatment of Lennox–Gastaut syndrome in 7 children, 3 had no seizures and the effective rate was 42.9%.",8297f169-60c3-44c7-b13d-e9272798be6a
31,discussion7," The onset of the effect of KD was rapid in the treatment of epileptic encephalopathy in children, and this was effective in nearly one‐half of the children. This conclusion was consistent with international research, especially in the treatment of Doose and West syndromes. The effect was relatively good with a satisfactory clinical response, which is worthy of application for clinicians.  KD cannot only effectively alleviate clinical seizures in children with epilepsy, but can also significantly improve the effect compliance adverse reactions electroencephalogram (EEG)s of children with epilepsy. Hallböök et al. (2007) found that the interictal epileptic discharge frequency 3 months after KD treatment was significantly decreased compared with pre‐treatment. Remahl et al. (2008) compared the 24‐hr effect compliance adverse reactions electroencephalogram (EEG) of 23 children who were treated with KD before and after treatment. In addition to the 65.",196a4d32-5323-4c21-ac2c-0935eee539fa
32,discussion8,"2% (15/23) of patients with a decrease in interictal epileptic discharge frequency, the background rhythm was more normal, and these changes were shown on effect compliance adverse reactions electroencephalogram (EEG)s (Remahl et al., 2008). Even the patients who had poor efficacy after KD treatment, the changes in effect compliance adverse reactions electroencephalogram (EEG)s were apparent (Remahl et al., 2008). Dressler et al. (2010) also reported a significant improvement in interictal epileptic discharge frequency and the background rhythm in the effect compliance adverse reactions electroencephalogram (EEG)s after 6 months of KD treatment. Kessler, Gallagher, Shellhaas, Clancy, and Bergqvist (2011) observed 48 children treated with KD, and suggested that among the patients with a significant decrease in the discharge index at 1 month after KD treatment, the control of convulsions after 3 months was significantly improved. Ebus et al.",e9eb7e93-318e-48ad-82c0-aab2946e5ef2
33,discussion9," (2014) studied the effect compliance adverse reactions electroencephalogram (EEG)s of 34 children with pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy, and found that there was a correlation between the reduction in the epileptiform discharge index during sleep after 6 weeks of KD treatment and the decrease in clinical seizures after 6 months of KD treatment. The efficacy in patients with a decrease >30% in the epileptiform discharge index during sleep after 6 weeks of KD treatment was better (Ebus et al., 2014). In this study, the data showed that prolonging the KD treatment time significantly improved the patients' background rhythm. After treatment for 12 weeks, the effect compliance adverse reactions electroencephalogram (EEG)s of 19 children had improved background rhythms, and the interictal spike (cusp) wave index was decreased (>30%) in 26 children.",eae5d862-db8c-4a67-9cbb-320bb6bd601f
34,discussion10," There was a correlation between the reduction in the epileptiform discharge index during sleep after 1 month of KD treatment and the decrease in seizure after 3 months of KD treatment (r = .330, p = .017). We suggest that the early decrease in the epileptiform discharge index during sleep is conducive to the reduction in seizures of epileptic encephalopathy, thereby enhancing the efficacy. There are several studies which have confirmed that the reduction in early onset is more common than a reduction in relayed onset (Bergqvist, Schall, Gallagher, Cnaan, & Stallings, 2005; Coppola et al., 2002; Mosek, Natour, Neufeld, Shiff, & Vaisman, 2009). Some believe that such changes in effect compliance adverse reactions electroencephalogram (EEG)s occur because KD can produce antiepileptic‐like favorable electrophysiologic effects on the brain (Cantello et al., 2007; Kessler et al.",c4c0a8bc-af40-418c-8444-155a850723a8
35,discussion11,", 2011), and this effect can also be demonstrated in the brain electrophysiologic characteristics of patients with a poor response to KD treatment, indicating that KD has a positive effect on the central nervous system and cortical neurons, thus suggesting that KD can be used to treat epileptic electrical status, such as epilepsy with continuous spike‐waves during slow sleep and acquired epileptic aphasia to help improve cardiac function in children.  The basic purpose of KD treatment is to control seizures, reduce, and discontinue using medications, and to improve the cognitive ability of children. It has been shown that during KD treatment of children with epilepsy, a decrease in seizure frequency significantly improves the lives of children, and children actively communicate with their parents (Peuscher et al., 2012). The follow‐up results showed that after KD treatment, some children had improvement in motor function, language ability, and cognitive function.",2ba4fdfe-b5fc-4574-a948-ec2444f5f261
36,discussion12," In all, 23 patients had cognitive improvement, including 14 without seizures, 6 with infrequent seizures, and 3 with significant improvement 12 weeks after treatment. In all, 12 patients exhibited improvement in language ability, including 7 without clinical attacks, 4 with sporadic seizures, and 1 with a significant improvement 12 weeks after treatment. In all, 10 patients had motor function improvement, including 5 without seizures, 4 with rare seizures, and 1 had significant improvement 12 weeks after KD treatment, but the degree of improvement in cognitive function was too small to reach statistical significance. This result is similar to the international study conducted by Lambrechts et al. (2013).",3423fca0-86e2-4530-bd3c-eabfd72791c8
37,discussion13," KD treatment is a relatively safe treatment method, which can play a role in cognitive and motor function of children, and a large number of tests have confirmed that KD can control the onset of pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy and improve cognition, which may be reflect a reduction in memory impairment caused by seizures in KD‐treated children (Jiang et al., 2016). The mechanism underlying KD treatment may be related to neuroprotection (Hallböök, Ji, Maudsley, & Martin, 2012), a reduction in clinical seizure activity, improved energy metabolism, and a reduction in stress‐induced biochemical effects within the hippocampus, thus improving the internal environment and improving cognitive and behavioral function (Brownlow, Jung, Moore, Bechmann, & Jankord, 2017).  In addition, common adverse reactions of KD treatment include vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and sleep.",76ee8801-39e3-4947-892f-1d9d136c5c91
38,discussion14," A small percentage of children will experience asymptomatic hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction, urinary stones, and other adverse reactions; however, the adverse reactions have no effect on normal growth and development of children. The results of this study showed that 23 children had 1–3 types of adverse reactions during KD treatment, of whom 20 had varying severity of digestive symptoms, and 4 had sustained symptoms. In all, 11 patients had asymptomatic hypoglycemia, and 12 had increased sleep needs within 1 week of onset, and 1 had abnormal liver function. After symptomatic treatment, the adverse reactions in most patients subside, which was in agreement with the findings of other domestic and international researchers.  A number of researchers may be more concerned about how the long‐term treatment with a KD will affect the growth curve, resulting in application concerns.",117b8e9b-919f-480e-a565-2d3464b4db22
39,discussion15," Numis, Yellen, Chu‐Shore, Pfeifer, and Thiele (2011) reported that the growth curve is not affected by the KD, but three females with GLUT1 deficiency who were treated with a KD for 5 years showed that the bone mineral content and bone mineral density were not negatively affected (Bertoli et al., 2014). Adverse reactions should be given full attention, and effective measures should be taken for prevention and/or intervention.  In short, KD therapy plays an important role in the treatment of pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy, and is important for the treatment of children with epileptic encephalopathy treatment. The results of this study suggest that KD not only has good clinical efficacy in the treatment of pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy in children, but also can significantly reduce the interictal epileptic discharge frequency and improve the background rhythm of effect compliance adverse reactions electroencephalogram (EEG)s.",024a3195-adee-4f71-97bf-840b36095a73
40,discussion16," The early decrease in the epileptic discharge index during the sleep period is beneficial for decreasing epileptic seizures in patients with epileptic encephalopathy, thus improving the efficacy, and in reducing the clinical seizures at the same time, improving cardiac function, and improving cognitive function, language, and motor function, thereby enhancing the quality of life of patients. Although some adverse effects exist during KD treatment, the effects are mainly transient or treatable gastrointestinal symptoms and metabolic disorders, but all adverse reactions were mild, and all can be tolerated and improved through appropriate treatment and adjustment. For children with pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy, KD treatment is regarded as a clinically effective treatment option when the regular combination of a variety of antiepileptic drugs are ineffective, so KD treatment is worthy of wide application by pediatric neurologists.",3e4611f9-4842-4514-bde9-127834282e7f
