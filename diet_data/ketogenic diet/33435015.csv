0,introduction0," The incidence of diseases associated with lifestyle factors such as diet has been steadily increasing over the last few decades and poses a significant global healthcare burden.1 2 Western diets, typically high in long-chain saturated fats and refined carbohydrates, are linked with the development of metabolic dysfunction characterised by obesity, hypertension and insulin resistance.3 4 This is termed the metabolic syndrome and places individuals at increased risk of disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.5–7 Recent evidence suggests that consumption of a Western diet may also be associated with cognitive impairment and changes to brain structure and function. Impaired cognition appears to be more common, and more pronounced, in people with obesity8 9 or type 2 diabetes mellitus.",6ff71c4c-be62-4ebf-ab1b-0c186fbed0bf
1,introduction1,"10 11 12 The consumption of a Western diet has been associated with the development of dementia including Alzheimer’s disease,13 14 and metabolic syndrome itself is an identified risk factor for the condition.15 In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Ageing, cognitively normal individuals with metabolic syndrome did not have increased cerebral amyloid (determined using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) Positron Emission Tomography (Positron Emission Tomography (PET)) neuroimaging) at baseline when compared with patients without the metabolic syndrome, but the rate of accumulation of cerebral amyloid in the following 2.6 years was higher in PiB Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-positive persons with metabolic syndrome than in PiB positive persons without metabolic syndrome; and these changes were more pronounced in brain regions associated with the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.",9bca939a-bdd2-4dac-a1be-698beea9cfb0
2,introduction2,"16 However, studies in the Lothian Birth Cohort17 suggest that the association between body mass index and impaired cognition in adults could be largely explained by differences in childhood IQ and socioeconomic factors.  It is therefore not clear whether metabolic syndrome causes an increased incidence of cognitive decline in later life and a more rapid progression of a pre-existing cognitive decline; or whether metabolic syndrome and cognitive decline are independent but share risk factors. Because of the increasing numbers of those affected by metabolic disorders and cognitive impairment,1 18 understanding dietary effects on cognition and the mechanisms that subserve these effects is of critical importance for human health.",477158f0-6a28-4f3c-bcdc-99cddf611906
3,introduction3,"  Most preclinical studies have focused on the effects of dietary fat and carbohydrate, alone or in combination, and this systematic review will particularly focus on describing the effects of dietary fat on cognitive function in mice and rats and the potential mechanisms of any effect. The scope of our systematic review is restricted to the study of mice and rats, to limit between-study heterogeneity. Many rodent studies suggest that the consumption of a diet high in fat (a ‘high-fat diet’) and refined sugars leads to cognitive deficits, confirming effects observed in human studies. Diet-induced cognitive deficits in rodent models have been reported in various learning and memory tasks,19–23 though reported effects often vary between studies.24 Preclinical research additionally supplies more detailed information about potential central mechanisms involved in these effects.",958e397f-4ac7-483b-a6da-e10418d5512c
4,introduction4," Rodent studies have shown that consumption of a high-fat diet associated with cognitive impairment is linked to brain inflammation, causing increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and immune cell activation.19 25 26 Oxidative stress has also been shown to occur in the brains of high-fat-fed rodents and cognitive impairment to be alleviated by the administration of antioxidant treatments.27 28 Moreover, high-fat diet-induced cognitive impairments have been linked to deficits in insulin signalling and brain insulin resistance29 30 as well as changes to synaptic plasticity,31 including alterations to neurotrophic factors such as Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)).32  Interpretation of observed effects of high-fat diets on cognition or potential underlying mechanisms may not be straightforward if there is heterogeneity in experimental designs and in the definition and description of the dietary interventions.",ee2f5ace-c779-4bdb-bdd1-32f7d77adcf9
5,introduction5," Various terms are used to describe diets with high(er) levels of fat including ‘high-fat diets’, ‘Western diets’, ‘high-fat-sugar diets’, ‘high-energy diets’ or ‘cafeteria diets’. The exact composition of these diets and the control diets used, for instance, the content and types of fats and carbohydrates, may be variable and not completely defined. It is not known whether effects vary when using different species, strains and ages of experimental animals or the impact of varying key experimental parameters such as duration of diet exposure and type of behaviour assessments employed.24 33 Finally, in other fields, low levels of measures to reduce the risks of bias have been reported in in vivo research,34 35 and that lower reporting is associated with larger estimates of biological effect. The extent to which in vivo research on the impact of dietary fat intake on cognition might be similarly affected is not known.",02a17bce-050b-4a33-a444-0b04dd6c6d4f
6,introduction6,"  Of particular interest are studies of the effect of high-fat diets with very low levels of carbohydrates. These are referred to as ketogenic diets as they induce the production of ketone bodies from fat (ketogenesis) as an alternative energy source to glucose36 and have been suggested as therapies for a number of conditions.37 38 Studies variously suggest that in animals, ketogenic diets are neuroprotective and boost cognition39 or are detrimental to brain function.40  Our understanding of the effects of dietary fat on brain function would be enhanced by a comprehensive summary of in vivo research. Here we present a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of diet composition, particularly fat, on cognitive function in mice and rats, and of the available evidence regarding potential underlying mechanisms.",2b172e01-d58a-4bfe-8e81-0bbadedc32c1

The effects of high-fat diets on cognition will be determined by extracting outcome data in behavioural tests of cognition. Detailed study characteristics (animal and diet characteristics, intervention, experimental design, outcome assessment) will be collected and analysed, and their impact on outcome measures will be assessed. We also aim to assess study quality and measures to limit risk of bias and to evaluate the impact of these on reported results.

18,methods10," However, during the screening process (see below), it was found that many studies used younger animals, and on reflection, it was considered that dietary modification in early life, but after weaning, was of biological importance and of interest for the review; the inclusion criteria were therefore amended accordingly.

Additionally, confidence in results will be increased for studies with large magnitude of effect. Confidence will be decreased by low study quality, high risks of bias, inconsistency of findings and imprecision (large confidence intervals). Given the expected heterogeneity in the circumstances of experimental evaluation, heterogeneity of observed effects will not reduce confidence in the findings presented.

Non-cognitive components of eligible cognitive tasks (eg, swim speed for Morris water maze, total object exploration time for novel object recognition) will also not be quantitatively assessed. The effects of diet on cognition will be determined by comparisons in task performance between high-fat and standard diet groups and the effects of interventions on cognition determined by comparing intervention and control groups in animals fed a high-fat diet.

Diets may also be diverse, consisting of variable proportions and types of fats, carbohydrates and protein. Different behavioural tasks and methods of outcome assessment to measure cognitive performance may also be used.24 33 Summarising available evidence and reaching robust conclusions of the effects of diet composition, particularly fat, on cognition and the underlying mechanisms for any effects is therefore challenging and has not to date been systematically addressed in reviews of the field.",8734e0a7-22f3-4b9b-8293-35f0867b5dd7

By collecting details of model selection and experimental design and assessing how these are associated with differences in cognitive outcome, we aim to understand better the observed heterogeneity in reported effects of dietary fat on cognition. For instance, studies have suggested that responses to high-fat diets may depend on the age49 and sex50 of experimental animals and have shown different patterns in cognitive impairment based on behaviour task used (eg, spatial vs non-spatial) and duration of exposure to diet.51–53 Additionally, by reviewing studies using high-fat but very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets, we hope to further understand the separate roles of fat and carbohydrate diet components in inducing cognitive changes.",f7ff514d-1a07-4a80-9e0c-58ed32e3df60
