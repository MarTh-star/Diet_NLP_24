0,conclusion0," The treatment of epilepsy associated with ID remains a challenge for clinicians. Conventional ASMs still represent the mainstay of therapy, but new strategies are emerging. Hormone therapy has long been the first choice in the treatment of some epileptic disorders, such as West syndrome, and has shown encouraging results in some clinical trials. Non-pharmacological approaches play a leading role, especially in cases of drug resistance or drug toxicity. KD is a well-established treatment for many epilepsy syndromes such as Dravet syndrome, Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), refractory infantile spasms and other drug-resistant epilepsies. Epilepsy surgery must be considered for seizures refractory to medical therapy and encompasses respective procedures and neuromodulation techniques. Finally, gene therapy has demonstrated a positive effect on seizure activity in preclinical studies and may play an important role in future epilepsy treatment.",4c53cbf9-ad5f-46e9-920f-e94057ef69a6
1,conclusion1," The main difficulties related to gene therapy consist in achieving stable, predictable and safe transgene expression. Deepening the knowledge of the molecular basis of epilepsy can lead to novel treatments directed to improving both the cognitive functioning and quality of life of patients.
