0,discussion0," Nutritional ketosis induced through a ketogenic diet leads to higher, but controlled, plasma ketone concentrations (>0.5-1.0 mM). Most human studies provide evidence of a higher effect in short-term weight loss of the KDs compared to isocaloric balanced diets in T2D and obese/overweight subjects, nevertheless controversies remain about the use of KDs in other metabolic disease such as T1D and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Scarce evidence exists regarding the effects of KDs in PCOS.  The important weight loss effect with KDs compared to standard diets is largely attributable to higher plasma ketones (31, 127); however, the exact threshold of ketosis needed to control appetite, as well as the exact mechanisms underlying this effect have yet to be established.  KDs might also display additional cardiometabolic benefits, beyond (and in addition to) weight loss, which may rely on different mechanisms.",49e545d3-f2b6-46e2-b5c1-47e4b618386a
1,discussion1," The very limited carbohydrate assumption mainly accounts for the improvement in glucose levels and insulin resistance, often reported in subjects with obesity/diabetes.  Recent evidence supports a different mechanism for KD effects on the amelioration in lipid profile (in particular triglycerides) and inflammation which might be of particular relevance in insulin resistance-related disorders. Ketones can bind specific G protein coupled receptors (GPCR)s - i.e. GPR109A (50), GPR41 (55) and GPR43 (56) - through which they are able to directly modulate lipid metabolism and inflammation. The activation of acetoacetate-GPR43 axis promotes lipid utilization by plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activation (56), whilst that of GPR109A by β-OHB decreased adipocytic lipase activity and consequent hepatic triglyceride synthesis (46, 51). In addition, the activation of GPR41 by β-OHB may probably negatively regulate energy intake and metabolism through the suppression of sympathetic activation (55).",db376c61-1865-41cb-a3e2-d3ef52a399fa
2,discussion2," Comparably, GPR109A-mediated inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome by β-OHB presumably accounts for the anti-inflammatory effects associated to a KD regimen, leading to an anti-atherogenic polarization of macrophages in M2 phenotype (1, 45, 50, 52).  However, despite a strong preclinical and animal evidence, (45, 50, 52) points to a role of ketones in the reduction of inflammation - which is a common trait of metabolic diseases - a robust clinical confirmation is still lacking. Mechanistic human studies are warranted to ascertain whether G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) signalling activation by ketones might be of clinical relevance in favourably affecting lipid and inflammatory profiles, independently or in addition to the important weight reduction.  Human intervention studies with KDs are fraught with important limitations since high-quality and long-term evidence is currently scant.",984b79d5-f663-4734-864d-9385bf646433
3,discussion3,"  Most interventions span over a period of a few weeks and KD adherence is limited by the very low carbohydrate content (<50g/day) (16). In addition, many studies report only partial data on calories/macronutrients composition of the diets and on the achieved plasma ketone levels, which may account for result heterogeneity among different studies. Ultimately, data on long-term beneficial effects and safety of KD on metabolic/endocrinological disorders are still needed.  In conclusion, although KDs hold a strong potential in the treatment of endocrinological and metabolic disorders due to a broader spectrum of short-term beneficial therapeutic effects in reducing weight and appetite, in ameliorating lipid and glucose profile and the inflammatory milieu, definitive conclusions are difficult to be drawn.
