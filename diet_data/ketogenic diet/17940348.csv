0,background0,"Cancer is caused by multiple complex processes influencing cellular proliferation, differentiation and death. Genetic alterations favouring growth drive the transformation of normal cells into malignant cells [1]. The relationship between cancer-causing genes and cellular energy metabolism is only partially understood [2]. Several authors have shown that genetic alterations promoting tumour development directly affect glucose-mediated energy metabolism [3,4]. Thompson and colleagues, for example, determined that the activated serine/threonine kinase Akt promotes glucose consumption in transformed cells without affecting the rate of oxidative phorphorylation [5].  The conversion of glucose to lactic acid via the reduction of pyruvate, even in the presence of oxygen, is known as aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect. Aggressive tumours frequently exhibit this metabolic alteration and reveal an increasing dependency on the glycolytic pathway for ATP generation.",20debb0d-cf45-4480-9ce9-c2c91866e21a
1,background1," Most cells of non-malignant tissues, in contrast, use pyruvate to produce ATP via mitochondrial respiration in the presence of oxygen. Warburg claimed that cancer results from impaired mitochondrial metabolism. The increased glycolysis is thought to be a response to the hypoxic conditions characterising the microenvironment of malignant cells [6]. An upregulation of glycolysis is associated with a marked increase in glucose consumption, which can be observed by tumour imaging techniques such as positron-emission tomography. The conversion of pyruvate to lactic acid leads to microenvironmental acidosis and facilitates both invasion and metastasis [7,8]. In addition, lactic acid suppresses the proliferation of and cytokine production by human cytotoxic T lymphocytes and causes a significant decrease in their cytotoxic activity [9].",228be1a7-8017-47af-91bd-ca202deeb0c7
2,background2," The latter finding may explain the frequently observed inability of the immune system to control aggressive cancer despite a specific T-cell response against tumour-associated antigens.  Therapies designed to target the anaerobic metabolism of tumours may preferentially kill malignant cells exhibiting this metabolic alteration. Promising experimental results in the treatment of certain types of tumours have been obtained with inhibitors of glycolysis [6] or of the pentose phosphate pathway [10], and with ketogenic diets [11]. Most malignant tumours are largely dependent on glucose for their growth and survival, but they are unable to metabolise ketone bodies for energy production [11]. A ketogenic diet restricts the glucose supply while providing the body with adequate energy substrates in the form of fat for generating ketone bodies. In 1995 Nebeling and coworkers described the long-term management of paediatric astrocytoma patients by a ketogenic diet.",ceb32138-80b8-42c1-b31f-4d17f9f555e9
3,background3," In addition to its beneficial effect on tumour growth, the diet improved the patients' nutritional status [12].  Ketogenic diets aim to induce ketosis, a physiological response of the body to limited dietary carbohydrate intake with consequent exhaustion of the glycogen content in liver and skeletal muscle resulting in the body's use of fat for energy. During ketosis, the liver starts to degrade fatty acids and to form acetyl-CoA in fatty acid oxidation. Acetyl-CoA can then be diverted into the ketone bodies acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB), the major ketone body in plasma [13]. Ketone bodies are transported from the liver to other tissues where they can be reconverted to acetyl-CoA. Although glucose is the preferred fuel, ketone bodies can supply 2% to 6% of the body's energy needs after an overnight fast and 30% to 40% after a 3-day fast. The brain can also utilise ketone bodies to supply up to 60% of its metabolic energy needs [13].",01dc9d08-8e1e-4ab2-b993-2e2fef0cd4b0
4,background4,"  When applied under caloric restriction, different ketogenic diets supplemented with either lard or soybean oil have been shown to have an inhibitory effect on tumour growth [14-16]. However, under caloric restriction the diets led to a dramatic weight loss in contrast to ad libitum feeding. Several groups have focused on the impact of lipid oils on both tumour growth and body weight. Without caloric restriction, an anti-tumour effect was demonstrated for diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids and medium chain (6–12 carbons) triglycerides (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)), which are not present in lard and scare in soybean oil [17-20]. Different researchers have repeatedly shown in animal experiments that the growth of human cancer xenografts can be slowed by omega-3 fatty acid-enriched diets [21-23]. Still, the potency of omega-3 fatty acids to reduce the risk of cancer in humans remains controversial [24-27].",b2cc9743-fc8e-4564-8863-2629ef6ca0af
5,background5," An anti-angiogenic effect of omega-3 fatty acids has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo [28-30]. A recent study revealed that the risk of prostate cancer can be modulated by the dietary omega-6/omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio in prostate-specific Pten knockout mice [31]. Since Pten acts as a suppressor of Akt signalling, which itself is intimately linked to the glycolytic phenotype, these experiments provide a link between lipid and glucose metabolism in pathological conditions.  To determine the impact of a ketogenic diet on tumours exhibiting aerobic glycolysis, we compared the effects on growth and survival of a nutritionally balanced carbohydrate-restricted diet supplemented with a mixture of vegetable oils and oil extracts possessing elevated levels of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) with those of a standard diet in a mouse xenograft model.",ac9fef60-6904-4030-9366-8bc33708c026

30,discussion0,"This study was designed to test whether a ketogenic diet can inhibit the growth of tumours of the human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line 23132/87 in a xenograft model. The tumour cells demonstrated increased glucose consumption and lactate production in vitro. They were positive for TKTL1, a marker enzyme of aerobic glycolysis [36], whose expression has been shown to correlate with a poor prognosis in a variety of carcinomas [37-40]. The ketogenic diet used here provides average protein and is low in carbohydrates and high in fat enriched with omega-3 fatty acids and medium chain triglycerides (MCT). Compared to the applied standard diet, the unrestricted ketogenic diet had a retarding effect on tumour growth and resulted in larger necrotic areas within the tumours. Blood glucose levels in the KD group were unaltered, but its ketone body levels were significantly elevated compared to those of the SD group.",0ed39814-ef02-4683-847f-6ac68ca26372
31,discussion1," Since our study does not allow to decide whether the effects of the diet are due primarily to omega-3 fatty acids and medium chain triglycerides (MCT), or to a combination, further studies are needed to address this issue.  The observation that unrestricted access to the ketogenic diet retarded tumour growth contrasts with data on another ketogenic diet, KetoCal, a commercially available diet for children with epilepsy [16]. The therapeutic effect of KetoCal on tumour growth was apparent in adult mice only when their caloric intake was restricted, which resulted in a 20% – 23% loss in body weight within eight days after start of feeding. KetoCal provided to animals ad libitum produced no marked loss in body weight but also had no influence on tumour growth [16]. In contrast to the calorically restricted KetoCal diet, we observed neither significant weight loss nor reduced blood glucose levels in our animals, although the tumour suppressive effects of the diets were comparable.",b10e2998-2211-44ef-acdd-401f8e6c2f64
32,discussion2," Our data therefore suggest that an effective metabolic tumour therapy is not necessarily accompanied by reduced blood glucose levels. A possible cause of the observed delaying effect of the ketogenic diet on tumour growth is the high levels of omega-3 fatty acids and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) in the diet. An antitumour effect has been demonstrated for both omega-3 fatty acids and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) in patients and experimental models [17-21,24].  Cancer patients with advanced incurable cancer are typically threatened by cancer cachexia, characterised by progressive weight loss, mainly due to loss of fat and skeletal muscle, and anorexia [41]. Although cancer cachexia accounts for about 20% of cancer deaths, its underlying mechanisms are not known in detail [42]. To improve the quality of life and survival time of incurable patients, it is important to avert the onset of cachexia.",a54d7a4e-6fd0-4986-9ca0-5b058bfa44e1
33,discussion3," Calorically restricted diets are therefore not suitable as treatment for these patients. Ketogenic diets, however, with high fat, adequate protein and low carbohydrates, have been shown to prevent or limit the protein catabolism in skeletal muscle [43]. In 1995 Nebeling et al. proposed a ketogenic diet rich in medium chain triglycerides (MCT) as a successful therapeutic option in pediatric cancer patients [12]. Barber et al. later reported that the combination of fish oil and an energy-dense nutritional supplement increased body weight in cachectic cancer patients [44]. A non-restricted ketogenic diet may thus indeed be capable of benefiting cachectic cancer patients when supplemented with adequate lipids. The ketogenic diet described in this study induced both a slight increase in body weight and a slower growth rate of human tumour cells in nude mice.  Tumours of the KD group were characterised by significantly larger necrotic areas than those of the SD group.",08b16623-f0c4-4999-a3fe-1e16acf3c4f9
34,discussion4," This finding may be explained by the restricted glucose supply in the KD group. However, we did not find significant differences in blood glucose levels of KD and SD animals. This observation indicates that glucose is synthesised from noncarbohydrate precursors by a process called gluconeogenesis. Fearon et al. even found higher blood glucose levels in ketotic, tumour bearing rats than in ketotic, non-tumour bearing rats. The authors considered that the inability of the ketogenic diet to reduce tumour growth was due to persistently high glucose levels [45]. In contrast, different feeding studies with carbohydrate-free diets showed significantly lower levels of circulating glucose compared to carbohydrate-enriched diets [46]. Nebeling et al. described that within 7 days of initiating ketogenic diet, blood glucose levels declined to low levels [12]. In addition, the authors calculated from results of PET scans a 21.8% average decrease in glucose uptake at the tumour site.",19d95139-56cb-41da-b170-7ce641573739
35,discussion5," One possible explanation for the significantly delayed tumour growth despite constant blood glucose levels in mice of the KD group is the ability of ketogenic diets to significantly reduce blood insulin levels [47]. It is widely accepted that frequently elevated levels of insulin can stimulate tumour growth [48]. We found slightly reduced insulin levels in KD animals, but the difference to insulin levels of SD animals was not significant.  Another possible explanation for the antitumour effect of the ketogenic diet is its ability to delay tumour take. Following tumour cell injection the animals of the KD group were fed with the ketogenic diet. The comparison of the individual tumour volumes of KD animals reveals that the unrestricted ketogenic diet delayed tumour growth strongly in the first 20 days after tumour cell inoculation. Five tumours in the KD group did not grow, 3 tumours grew slightly, whereas only 4 tumours grew as fast as the tumours of the SD group.",500d3a15-7688-4f00-b6b5-f238d4bee8a5
36,discussion6," The observation that the ketogenic diet delays the tumour cell take could be clinically significant for prevention of metastatic tumour cell take. However, further studies are required to accurately discriminate the effects of the ketogenic diet.  The significantly larger necrotic areas in the centre of tumours grown in the KD mice correlate well with the reduced microvessel density in these tumours. The suppression of neovascularization may be provoked by the anti-angiogenic effect of omega-3 fatty acids [28-30], as well as by reduced levels of lactate/pyruvate in glucose-starved tumour cells, which are able to stimulate angiogenesis via HIF-1-mediated transactivation of VEGF [49]. Suppressed neovascularisation may further inhibit an adequate supply of glucose to the centre of the tumours. In aggressive tumour cells such a severe limitation of substrate produces a state termed 'metabolic catastrophe', which enhances necrosis.",8fdfa224-2606-41ad-b57d-a5cf994fca7a
37,discussion7," The therapeutic induction of metabolic catastrophe was recently proposed as an approach to killing ""unkillable"" tumour cells [50]. Since glucose-fermenting tumour cells have been shown to have substantially enhanced resistance to several anticancer drugs [51,52], the combined application of conventional chemotherapy and metabolic tumour therapy may represent an effective approach for targeting both fermentative and respiratory cell populations.  Transplantation of human cancer cells or tumour biopsies into immunodeficient mice is a commonly used xenograft model [53]. Since this model precludes T cell-mediated cellular immunity, the results do not reflect any immunosuppressive effects of lactate as a by-product of glucose fermentation. Due to lactate's suppressive effect on the cellular immune response [9], it is conceivable that the ketogenic diet we applied would have more profound effects in a model that allows a T-cell response directed against tumour-associated antigens.",cdaf6d93-5c88-496a-b8b3-4460c00fd722
38,discussion8, Additional studies using other models are necessary to further explore the true potential of metabolic tumour therapy in a functionally active immune system.  Conclusion In this pilot study we demonstrate that a carbohydrate-restricted diet supplemented by lipids rich in omega-3 fatty acids and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) delays the growth of glucose fermenting tumours. The effect did not depend on caloric restriction and there was no loss of body weight. Further studies are needed to address the impact of metabolic therapy on additional tumour-relevant functions such as invasive growth and metastasis. The ketogenic diet described here may provide a promising strategy for targeting glucose fermenting cell populations in vivo.,b2550657-1d08-4ffb-8075-7878e6add61f
