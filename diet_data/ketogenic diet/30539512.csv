0,background0," Dietary restriction in individuals with obesity who report binge eating and wish to lose weight is associated with mixed outcomes [1–3]. These inconsistencies are partly as a result of a lack of consensus regarding definitions of dietary restriction as well as diagnostic differences among study populations. For example, although dietary restriction may play a causal role in the development and maintenance of disordered eating in bulimia nervosa [4], studies specifically examining the effects of strict dieting in binge eating disorder (binge eating disorder (BED)) have reported significant reductions and even remission of binge eating [5–8]. Re-introduction of normal dietary patterns is accompanied by an increase in binge eating, however the severity does not reach pre-treatment levels and many patients no longer meet criteria for binge eating disorder (BED) [5, 7, 8].",b7902db3-fa63-4ad0-8bf1-fceee3ead048
1,background1," According to the DSM-5, the key diagnostic features of binge eating disorder (BED) include recurrent and persistent episodes of binge eating, marked distress regarding binge eating, absence of regular compensatory behaviors, and binge eating episodes associated with a variety of physical and psychological symptoms [9].  Often seen co-morbid with binge eating disorder (BED) are food addiction symptoms of cravings and lack of control. Although food addiction is a controversial construct, the most widely used tool for assessing self-reported addictive symptoms in relation to food is the Yale Food Addiction Scale (Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS))—which was developed by modeling the DSM-IV criteria for substance abuse [10]. Food addiction symptoms have been described as an addictive response to foods such as sweets and starches.",59696d98-f629-495e-bde8-5ca95e9f70c4
2,background2," These symptoms include much time spent obtaining food, feelings of withdrawal when off food, continued use despite knowledge of adverse consequences, important activities reduced or given up, repeated unsuccessful attempts to quit, and taken in larger quantities or longer periods than intended [11]. The prevalence of food addiction symptoms within individuals with obesity, using Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) criteria, ranges from 15 to 20% [12–14] with rates up to 42% among candidates for bariatric surgery [15, 16]. While the extent of overlap between food addiction and binge eating disorder (BED) is unclear, the subset of binge eaters with food addiction represent a more impaired group [17]. Higher levels of binge frequency have been associated with higher scores on the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) with severe food addiction identified as a score of at least a 6 [18].",76620d95-2555-45bb-b8bb-c7e9b42f1047
3,background3," However, there are currently no studies that estimate Food Addiction prevalence or incidence separate of the obese condition. There are also no studies validating consistent food addiction diagnostic criteria, and how these should differ from Binge Eating Disorder diagnostic criteria. The impact of dietary restriction among patients who report greater food addiction symptoms has not been clearly established, however a study has shown in a general population an increase in food cravings in restrained eaters compared to unrestrained eaters of specific foods, such as chocolate [19].  Ketogenic diets are high-fat, low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein dietary patterns in which the body’s principal energy source is fat. This falls into an approximate range of 60% fat, 10% carbohydrates, and 30% protein. Typical energy intake per day on a ketogenic diet is at least 5040 kJ.",5a1050c5-ac5f-4ec4-b959-5ef929fb90ab
4,background4," If individuals adhere to this dietary pattern, nutritional ketosis results, which can be defined by sustaining blood beta-hydroxybuterate levels between .5 mmol/L and 3 mmol/L [20]. Sustained nutritional ketosis induces a series of physiological changes involving appetite suppression, lower hunger, greater satiety, greater rates of lipolysis, reduction of lipogenesis and increased metabolic costs of gluconeogenesis and thermic effect of proteins [21]. Studies demonstrating ketone-induced appetite suppression and enhanced satiety provide a theoretical basis for prescribing a ketogenic diet for individuals with obesity who report binge eating and food addiction symptoms [22]. Such patients often endorse an inability to withstand increased levels of hunger, disturbances of satiety (e.g., “never feeling full”), food cravings, and urges to binge eat, and cite these experiences as preventing them from achieving weight loss.",01056224-6e18-4d8d-b2a6-6c32a25f7801
5,background5,"  Hence, we report the findings of prescribing a ketogenic diet to three patients with obesity who endorsed binge eating, food addiction symptoms upon symptom presentation and reported a desire to lose weight and improve metabolic health. Selection of these patients by the authors was not based on amount of weight lost, but on endorsement of specific initial symptom presentation of binge eating or food addiction symptoms and co-morbid with the disease of obesity. Thus, these are the 3 cases reported. It was thought by the clinicians that the patients were suitable to try this approach given the treatment resistance and metabolic abnormalities the patient faced.  After describing the cases and their associated outcomes, we briefly reviewed the literature to explore possible biological mechanisms that may explain these outcomes.

She reported a history of sporadic attempts to lose weight with exercise, using over-the-counter weight loss pills, and attempting diet programs such as Weight Watchers. She reported that despite these efforts, her binge eating had only worsened. Her binge frequency was 1–3 times daily with estimated 14 + times per week consistently over years. She believes that this contributed to her recurrent depression and history of suicide attempts.  She denied any current use of illicit substances but did report a history of addiction to cocaine and nicotine during her thirties, which she overcame with the help of Narcotics Anonymous.",316abeac-7952-4983-a098-be74851dc9f3

20,background21," Patients reported significant reductions in self-reported symptoms of binge eating episodes and food addiction (as measured by Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS), Y-BOC-BE, or reported cravings). Additionally, the patients lost 10–24% of their body weight. Participants reported maintenance of treatment gains to date of over 9–17 months after initiation of the diet. In addition, when accompanied by co-morbid depressive symptoms, substantial improvements in mood symptoms corresponded with a decline in the PHQ-9.  Ketogenic diets have long been used as an effective treatment for pediatric epilepsy [26]. Randomized clinical trials have shown that a less stringent, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet, such as the intervention used for these patients, can be effective in treating obesity and reversing type 2 diabetes [27–29].",9269e5e1-502e-4b67-be4c-67040880c4bd
21,background22," Ketogenic diets have also been reported to be helpful in other clinical conditions, with case series documenting improvement or resolution of gastro-esophageal reflux disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Crohn’s disease [21, 30–32]. Less is known regarding the effect of ketogenic diets on mental health. Some have observed an improvement in mood in bipolar patients maintained on long-term ketogenic diets, hypothesizing that diet-induced nutritional ketosis mimics the action of mood stabilizers in reducing intracellular sodium and calcium [33]. Others have documented improvement in symptoms of psychosis in patients with schizophrenia [34, 35].  The mechanisms by which a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet influence binge eating and food addiction symptoms are complex, multifactorial, and may involve the effects of nutritional ketosis and its ensuing metabolic effects.",daf2f6e7-ede0-41a9-8352-0afd981375f5
22,background23," Literature review suggests potential mechanisms may involve changes in hormone systems which work to increase satiety, improve leptin sensitivity, and reduce appetite. This may include higher circulating levels of CCK, PYY, and decreases in ghrelin and leptin [36–44]. Other potential mechanisms the literature suggests include changes in metabolism of excitatory amino acids leading to gamma-Aminobutyric acid (gamma Aminobutyric acid (GABA)) inhibition and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) expression [45]. A complete discussion of the literature review on potential mechanisms are beyond the scope of this case series paper.  Limitations of this case series should be noted. Without a control condition, it is not possible to distinguish between the effects of dietary restriction generally, versus a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet specifically, in driving reductions in weight and binge eating symptoms.",8d4953e6-f7e4-4467-905c-121768fc115e
23,background24," Nor can we determine, without larger samples, whether the diet’s high acceptability among these three patients is typical. Blood ketones were not measured in case 1, but patients were required to complete dietary recalls at follow-ups and report tracking of their total carbohydrates per day. With nutritional ketosis, appetite suppression and satiety are expected effects, thus these symptoms were routinely monitored and obesity medicine physicians clinically distinguish between those in or out of ketosis based on the expected symptomology of ketosis. It is possible that having severe binge eating and food addiction symptoms, which placed these patients into a more impaired subgroup of patients, led them to experience greater benefits than those who were less impaired would have experienced. The relief of experiencing abstinence from cravings may have felt like a worthwhile tradeoff for this group, unlike less symptomatic patients.",8def81c0-036d-49d5-a96c-4146066dcbf2
24,background25," Additionally, although the Binge Eating Scale (Binge Eating Scale (BES)) scale has been validated to assess presence of binge eating symptoms, there is no research to show that it can validly diagnose cases of Binge Eating Disorder like the DSM-5 [24]. Finally, as patients were treated by different providers, only the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) was uniformly administered to all.  Despite these limitations, we feel this case series demonstrating the feasibility of low carbohydrate ketogenic diets among three individuals with obesity and self-reported binge eating and food addiction symptoms is important, given the lack of prior studies and the importance of understanding the impact of this specific diet for patients with such highly disordered eating.  In summary, research on the role of dietary restriction in the treatment of obesity with co-morbid disordered eating has been limited.",bb024ec3-0d3f-4779-80f7-754036adc01a
25,background26," We propose that achieving nutritional ketosis through macronutrient dietary restriction of carbohydrates in the treatment of obesity and self-reported binge eating and food addiction symptoms is potentially feasible. Patients experienced reductions in binge eating and food addiction while also losing weight. The findings are limited by the lack of a control group. Although the mechanisms by which sustained ketosis affect appetite and satiety are not definitively understood, they may include hormone-mediated impacts. Clinicians may wish to consider a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet for patients with obesity who report binge eating and food addiction symptoms, especially when other interventions have failed. Further research should seek to reproduce the observed effects in controlled trials as well as potential etiologies.",504f1d87-da47-4956-b371-494a52d8a34d
