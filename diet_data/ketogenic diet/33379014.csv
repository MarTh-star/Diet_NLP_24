0,discussion0," Developing nutritional strategies to maintain cognitive abilities or improve quality of life of patients with AD or other neurodegenerative disorders has always been a research priority (1, 3). However, numerous nutritional interventions have failed to demonstrate significant effects on cognition (29–31). The Mediterranean diet represents an interesting preventive intervention but its efficacy is limited once diagnosed with AD (32). Saturated fat intake, which typically increases on KD, may also increase AD risk. In the Chicago Health and Aging Project, intake of high saturated fat was associated to a two- to three-fold increased risk of incident AD (33). However, 10 years later, the same authors acknowledged that the epidemiologic literature was seemingly inconsistent on this topic. For example, in the latter study, a decreased risk of AD was also related to consumption of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (34).",23e02a24-fab3-45dc-adc5-d4ad9f90b814
1,discussion1," Yet, high fat KD as well as medium chain triglycerides (MCT) supplementation may positively influence the course of the disease, exerting a role on clinical symptoms (memory loss, executive function) but also on the pathophysiology of AD, in particular on inflammation or brain amyloid deposition (35).  During ketogenesis, the plasma concentration of KB (mainly β-hydroxybutyrate) gradually increases, and over 4 mmol/L, they become a source of energy for the central nervous system. In physiological ketosis, the concentration of KB does not exceed 8 mmol/L, blood pH remains stable, and glycemia, although decreasing, remains at its physiological concentration (36). Thus, KB can offset the absence of glucose act as an alternative fuel for the brain (37). In this context, KS or KD represent promising nutritional strategies to postpone cognitive decline due to AD, or even to rescue brain energy. As explained by Cunnane et al.",ede2966a-1d8f-47f8-8eec-12b091d8c6a0
2,discussion2," while brain glucose uptake is compromised in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), brain ketone uptake and metabolism remain normal, in both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild-moderate AD (38). β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate also demonstrated numerous benefic effects in neurological conditions, such as inhibit glutamatergic excitatory transmission in epilepsy and may also mitigate neuronal hyperexcitability resulting from AD neuropathology. The impact of these strategies even though symptomatic could be substantial given the number of people affected by AD. Besides, delaying the onset of behavioral symptoms or disability due to AD would lead to significant economic, public health and societal benefits (1).  Another original interest of the KD could be a reduction of carbohydrates consumption, which could trigger the brain amyloid accumulation. High glycemic diet was recently shown to influence change in amyloid levels, over the course of 1 year (6).",1fbc3a42-6f14-49e8-9353-77bc0c21956a
3,discussion3," In all participants, the association between change in amyloid retention and high glycemic diet was apparent in the precuneus. In prodromal AD, this brain area is specifically vulnerable to structural and functional alterations. Nevertheless, in participants with the highest amyloid status, this relationship extended into the posterior cingulate and lateral temporal lobe. These brain regions are highly susceptible to amyloid accumulation and metabolic impairment due to AD-related pathology. Thus, as demonstrated in animal models of AD, KD could play a direct protective role against the amyloid lesions of the disease (11).  However, an intriguing effect of KS is the cognitive improvement in healthy adults as well as in cognitively impaired patients, whereas the carbohydrates consumption remains equal.",5d0e5124-de9a-468c-86cd-b13139352727
4,discussion4," This effect could not be explained by the sole increase of energy supply to the brain, due to the rapid availability of KB following ingestion of medium chain triglycerides (MCT), since the doses used by several authors was low (22). The authors explained this gain in cognitive performance because of an increased rate of mitochondrial biogenesis. This phenomenon could be the benefic consequence of increased activation of PPARγ by KB.  Intermittent fasting has already been suggested as a therapeutic option for reducing the onset of neurodegenerative disorders (39). As in the KD, fasting induces a metabolic shift where energy results for KB. However, weight loss due to fasting is likely to accelerate cognitive decline, whereas maintaining stable weight and nutritional status are mandatory for patients with AD (23). Despite sufficient calorie intake, extreme carbohydrate restriction due to KD can profoundly affect diet quality.",48aaeb6e-5c52-4ecb-a87c-1087f9988df4
5,discussion5," Low-carbohydrate diets are often low in thiamin, folates, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B6, calcium, magnesium, iron or vitamin K. KD are typically low in fiber (40). In a recent prospective study, infants with drug-resistant epilepsy, who where started on KD (mostly 3:1), the incidence of adverse effects after one month of treatment was very high (91.7%), although none of them discontinued the diet for this reason (41). At diet initiation, the most common side effects were vomiting and hypoglycemia. After 1 month, the children mostly suffered from metabolic acidosis, constipation or vomiting. Non-compliance leading to diet interruption before 2 years of follow-up was reported in 21% of the infants. These findings confirm the long-term feasibility of such diet, in children. To determine whether similar results will be obtained with adults or older adults with AD remains a major challenge.",1ddc36df-7d17-4d70-b477-01a883c86206
6,discussion6," In all cases, the monitoring of all adverse effects as well as the adherence to diet will be mandatory, in future longitudinal trials. Providing sufficient calorie and micronutrients is crucial for preventing the adverse consequences of nutrient deficiency. Therefore, an adequate long-term KD should also include appropriate vitamin supplementation. Finally, Bostock et al. described the potential adverse effects of self-administered KD from users of online forums: increased LDL-cholesterol levels, headache, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, digestive symptoms, and heart palpitations (42). Longer-term effects may lead to anemia, low bone mineral density, nephrolithiasis or cardiomyopathy (36).  Conclusion  KD or medium chain triglycerides (MCT) supplementation may represent promising options to fight against the cognitive symptoms of AD, especially in the prodromal stage of the disease.",88ded248-fb8c-4f93-89b2-5c91bb5f896e
7,discussion7," A growing body of evidence has suggested that KD could enhance cognitive performance and hopefully postpone cognitive decline in AD. Large sampled randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up and appropriate clinical and biological outcomes (such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain metabolism biomarkers) are needed to address the issues pointed out in this review. Special attention should be given to the onset of adverse effects (malnutrition and weight loss, digestive symptoms) and to the adherence to the diet, especially if these interventions are considered in the long term, as for the treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Whether cognitive gains would be maintained upon discontinuation of the KD (or KS) remains unknown so far.  The kind of KD suiting best for AD deserves further investigation: very restrictive diets may allow faster ketosis, but increase the risk of poor adherence.",8e3799e3-956b-42ad-8ae0-727fd16d0fcf
8,discussion8," Recently, the Mediterranean diet has also been adapted to adhere to KD guidelines, and could represent a promising option to deal with the symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders.  Author Contributions  ML and FM-L performed a review of the literature, analyzed and interpreted the data and drafted the manuscript.
