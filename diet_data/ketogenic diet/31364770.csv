The study was approved (ethic approval code 764/18 S-IV)by the Human Ethics Review Board, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic and was performed in agreement with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2008. Prior to randomization, all subjects were required to sign an informed consent.  Using electronic randomization system, subjects were randomly assigned to follow either a cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) or RD (both with total caloric intake reduction by 500 kcal/day) while participating in three strength workouts and three aerobic workouts per week (30 min run, heart rate around 130–140 beats/min.) for 8 weeks.",e52bba03-e024-4d30-9fe7-2b77d3c9d88c
2,methods2," Total caloric intake reduction by 500 kcal/day is counted from balanced hypocaloric diet with a reduction of energy intake by 500 to 1000 kcal from the usual caloric intake. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) recommends such diets as the “standard treatment” for clinical trials (Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 1996)  Subject randomization and follow-up during the study is depicted in CONSORT diagram in Figure 1.  2.1. Baseline and Postinterventional Testing Data collection during baseline and post-intervention testing included medical history, anthropometric examination, power performance test, bicycle spiroergometry, and blood drawings to obtain laboratory data. BMI was calculated by the scale, using the height measurement. Accurate height was measured using a basic stadiometer (Seca 222, Seca Co., London, UK).  2.1.1.

Body weight and other body composition measurements (lean body mass, body fat mass, BMI, water content, and percentage of body fat) were taken with minimal clothes, no shoes, and measured to the nearest 0.5 kg.  Blood samples for biochemical measurements were taken prior to initiation of study and at the end of the study after 8 weeks of diet. Serum was obtained by centrifugation and samples were subsequently stored in aliquots at −80 °C until further analysis. The maximal storage time was 8 months.  Biochemical parameters liver test, urea, creatinine, and circulating lipids were measured to exclude liver, kidney, or lipid disorder. Creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were measured to explore a possible influence of the diets on muscle regeneration. β-hydroxy-butyrate was measured to confirm a compliance to ketogenic diet.",8d6871fd-beeb-4d79-a23f-469610372e54

If the lift/press was successful, after resting for another two to four minutes the load was increased by 5–10% and another lift/press was attempted. If the subject failed to perform the lift/press, after resting for two to four minutes they attempted the lift/press with weight reduced by 2.5–5%.  2.1.3. Methodology of Strength Testing Upon arrival, the primary researcher explained the testing procedures and protocols and demonstrated each test. Subjects were instructed to warm up.

6,methods6," Aerobic Performance Testing Aerobic performance testing was carried out by bicycle spiroergometry using analyzer of respiratory gases (Quark CPET, 1850 Bates Ave, Concord, CA 94520, Cosmed, USA). This metabolic cart measures expired airflow by means of a pneumotach connected to the mouthpiece. A sample line is connected to the pneumotach from which air is continuously pumped to O2 and CO2 gas analyzers. Prior to testing, the pneumotach was calibrated with six samples from a 3 L calibration syringe. The gas analyzers were also calibrated before each test to room air and calibration gases (15.21% O2 and 5.52% CO2, respectively). Heart rate (HR) was continuously recorded during exercise by electrocardiography (Fukuda Denshi FX-8322 Cardimax ECG, 17725 N. E. 65th Street Bldg. C, Redmond, WA. 98052 USA).  Prior to exercise, the subjects were instructed to maintain a pedal cadence between 70 and 90 rpm during exercise and to exercise to volitional fatigue.",cf3badea-f4b6-4a3e-b0d8-6ee358126d33
7,methods7," We used a modified exercise step protocol 0.33 W.min−1 as described by Gordon et al. [23]. The test was terminated when the subject was unable to maintain a pedaling cadence of 40 rpm.  Maximal oxygen consumption was assessed by the attainment of the following criteria: (1) a plateau (ΔVO2 ≤ 50 mL/min at VO2 peak and the closest neighboring data point) in VO2 with increases in external work, (2) maximal respiratory exchange ratio (respiratory exchange ratio (RER)) ≥ 1.10, and (3) maximal HR within 10 b/min of the age-predicted maximum (220-age). All subjects met the first two criteria.  Breath-by-breath gas exchange data from all tests were transferred to a spreadsheet program (MS Excel 365) for further analysis. In addition, data from the VO2max tests were time-averaged using 10 s intervals to examine the incidence of an oxygen plateau.  2.2.",c34a7570-1586-4ba2-beac-c28da97e5b1f
8,methods8," Diet Protocol Subjects were randomly assigned by electronic randomization system to either cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) or RD group for 8 weeks. Subjects had a mandatory dietary session with a nutritionist prior to the beginning of the study which provided detailed instructions on accurately keeping dietary food intake records.

The overall caloric intake (individually calculated according to somatotype, physical activity, type of work, etc.) was reduced by 500 kcal per day.  Both groups were given detailed instructions on acceptable foods for both types of diets. In addition, subjects were given an 8-week low-carbohydrate meal plan or reduction diet meal plan as per randomization.  2.3. Training Protocol 2.3.1. Development of Strength Skills The plan was designed to develop maximum strength in the tested exercise and the muscles involved. 3 differently focused trainings per week were performed:Focused on chest—bench press.  Focused on the muscles of the lower limbs—leg press.  Focused on the back muscles—lat pull-down.",b5adc6d1-1cd2-456b-a956-8a2a4583c736
10,methods10,"    One training unit lasted approximately 60 min. For each training unit, the full focus was on the technique of execution and time under tension. Each training unit was performed with the maximum possible effort to achieve the maximum results. The prescribed intensity in the form of load was individualized and based on the entry measurements. The technical design, time under tension and maximum effort must were similar for all subjects (maximum effort = maximum possible intensity in compliance with technical parameters and number of repetitions) under tension and maximum effort were similar for all subjects (maximum effort = maximum possible intensity in compliance with technical parameters and number of repetitions)  2.3.2.

11,methods11," Supervision of Adherence to Training and Diet Protocols Overall adherence to diet was checked once weekly by a nutritionist. Furthermore, adherence to cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) was evaluated through urinary ketone measurements performed twice daily and by measurement of blood β-hydroxybutyrate at the end of the study.  Training compliance was monitored through mandatory check-in procedures in a gym, and also by a sport tester for aerobic performance (TomTom Runner Cardio, TomTom, The Netherlands).  2.4. Post-Intervention Testing Data collection procedures were the same as baseline testing procedures. To ensure reliability, power measures and performance testing were completed by the same researcher as at baseline for each subject. In addition, subjects conducted their testing at the same time and with the same personal researcher as pre-testing. Results from all tests were compared to the individual’s baseline values and provided to the subjects after data analysis.  2.5.",b7b9b002-27f9-4d22-a56e-021c301d529a

Differences of body composition (body fat %, weight, BMI, lean body mass, and fat mass), biochemical, and strength or aerobic performance parameters between cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) and RD were evaluated using one-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak test. Paired t-test was used for the assessment of intra group differences as appropriate. Statistical significance was assigned to p < 0.05.  3. Results 3.1. The Influence of Cyclical Ketogenic Reduction Diet vs. Nutritionally Balanced Reduction Diet on Anthropometric and Biochemical Parameters Both cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) and RD decreased body weight (Figure 2), body fat mass and body mass index with comparable effects of both approaches (Table 1).",b308d9f7-df69-4180-89b0-e48555614f6e
13,methods13," Lean body mass and body water content was significantly reduced by cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) (Figure 3 and Figure 4 and Table 1) while it was not influenced by RD.  None of the diets significantly affected serum concentration of creatine kinase or lactate dehydrogenase (Table 1), liver tests, urea, creatinine, or circulating lipids (data not shown). β-hydroxy-butyrate significantly increased in cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) group while it was unaffected in subjects on reduction diet (Table 1).  3.2. The Influence of Cyclical Ketogenic Reduction Diet vs. Nutritionally Balanced Reduction Diet on Muscle Strength Parameters The muscle strength parameters were assessed as maximum weight lifted during bench press, lat pull-down, and leg press. cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) did not affect any of these parameters (Table 2).

15,methods15," Discussion The most important finding of this study is that eight weeks of regular aerobic exercise combined with exercise training complemented by two different dietary approaches—cyclical ketogenic reduction diet or nutritionally balanced reduction diet—significantly decreased body weight and body fat in healthy young men to a similar degree while having differential influence on body composition, strength parameters, and aerobic performance.  Despite comparable influence of both diets on body weight, we detected distinctions in their effects on body composition. In cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) group, the drop of body weight was due to a combination of decreased body fat, body water, and a slight, but significant, decline in lean body mass. On the contrary, in RD patients neither body water nor lean body mass were significantly affected and the weight reduction was predominantly due to body fat loss.",867b6424-6373-49e5-a922-be2a4df42b8f
16,methods16," The influence of ketogenic diet combined with different forms of exercise on body composition has been studied both in athletes and in patients with obesity and other comorbidities on numerous occasions. In some of the trials, isocaloric [24] or hypocaloric ketogenic diet [25] did not significantly change lean body mass while reducing body fat. On the contrary and in agreement with our current data, Perissious and colleagues found a reduction in lean body mass in patients with obesity undergoing exercise program while being on low carbohydrate diet [26]. Differential effect of ketogenic vs. nutritionally balanced diet under hyperenergetic conditions has also been described in a study in healthy men undergoing an eight-week resistance training program. Under these conditions, lean body mass increased only in control diet while it was unaffected in the ketogenic diet group [27].",bbedf2bb-6880-4d9e-8b27-d9e9a2045773
17,methods17," Finally, ad libitum low carbohydrate ketogenic diet reduced body mass and lean body mass without compromising performance in powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting athletes [28]. In our study, a slight decrease in lean body mass did not impair strength parameters as compared to baseline values. Nevertheless, we have noted that in RD patients both lat pull-down and leg-press significantly increased after eight weeks of intervention as compared to no change in subjects on cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD).  While neutral effect of cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) on strength parameters in our study could have been expected based on the previously published data [29,30], we hypothesized that ketogenic diet could be more efficacious in improving endurance parameters as compared to nutritionally-balanced reduction diet as suggested by some previous trials [31].",678408e1-6b4d-4cca-97f7-686466f86c7b
18,methods18," The increasing popularity of ketogenic diets in endurance athletes is based on the hypothesis that predominant fat utilization over the use of carbohydrates may improve energy availability during endurance exercise along with accelerated recovery [10]. Bailey and Hennesy recently reviewed available data on the influence of ketogenic diet on endurance in athletes. They included seven studies into their analysis and concluded that limited and heterogenous findings prohibit definitive conclusions [16]. In our study, we found decreased respiratory exchange ratio in cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) groups after eight weeks of intervention as compared with no effect of RD suggesting a shift towards lipid oxidation, which is in agreement with the mode of action of ketogenic diet and previously published data [32]. However, none of the endurance parameters as measured by spiroergometry have been affected in cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) group.",6e7c788a-b3e7-49da-bb3d-241eba503e96
19,methods19," On the contrary, in RD group peak oxygen uptake and peak workload significantly increased after eight weeks of intervention. Our data suggesting lack of improvement of endurance performance by ketogenic diet go in similar direction with results published by Burke and colleagues in 2017 [33] and reproduced by the same group in 2020 [34] where they found decreased endurance parameters in elite race walkers after ketogenic diet. By contrast, in one of the early studies, low carbohydrate diet improved endurance times during moderate exercise in moderately obese patients along with significant reductions in body weight and body fat mass [35]. Nevertheless, despite more pronounced fat loss the improvement on endurance performance with low carbohydrate diet was comparable to that of high carbohydrate diet group.  When interpreted the results of our study within the context of currently published data it is important to consider its strengths and limitations.",9cddbadf-0b05-4235-93eb-fb5e99e39935
20,methods20," The randomized design and the good compliance of the subjects to dietary and treatment regimens can be consider strong points of our trial. On the other hand, the limitations include relatively short duration, low number of subjects and inclusion of only male participants.  Taken together our data are in general agreement with most of the previously published studies [36] showing little or no benefit of ketogenic diet on endurance capacity. However, it should be noted that contribution of fatty acids to metabolic response may differ with respect to duration and intensity of exercise [37,38], exact type of training and numerous other characteristics. The utilization of fatty acids increases with prolonged bouts of exercise of moderate intensity suggesting that ketogenic diet might be useful especially with longer duration of aerobic exercise.  5.",2beced2b-9587-408c-b9a1-f3c58b052bd7
21,methods21," Conclusions In summary, our data show that in healthy young males undergoing resistance and aerobic training comparable weight reduction can be achieved with ketogenic and nutritionally balanced reduction diet. In RD group, improved muscle strength and endurance performance was noted relative to neutral effect of cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) on these parameters. Furthermore, cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) also slightly reduced lean body mass. Our study thus demonstrates that the cyclical ketogenic reduction diet effectively reduces body weight but is not an effective strategy to increase anaerobic or strength performance in healthy young men. All in all, further randomized studies of longer duration are still needed to explore whether the response to different diets is affected by long-term adaptation responses and whether it differs in males and females or subjects with various types and levels of fitness.
