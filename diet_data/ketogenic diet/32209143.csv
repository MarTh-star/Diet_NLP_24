0,methods0," 4.1. Animals and Experimental Design  The study was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (approval date: 28 November 2018, no. 901/2018-PR) according to European Union guidelines (Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments).  The animals were housed at the animal facility of the National Institute of Gastroenterology “S. De Bellis” Research Hospital, Castellana Grotte, Bari, Italy. All the applied procedures followed the International Guidelines for the use of laboratory animals, minimizing animal suffering.  The animal model chosen is the newborn Wistar Rat subjected to early life stress (ELS) through MD to induce irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adulthood [58]. Postnatal Day 0 (Postnatal Day (PND) 0) was considered as the birthday. Within Postnatal Day (PND)s 2 to 14, the puppies experienced MD for 3 h a day.",6a524c08-0d39-49f0-8193-1694fe799cb1
1,methods1,"  The experimental design provided that, after weaning, the animals subjected to MD were further divided into two subgroups, one group fed a standard diet (irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-Std), and one group fed a low carbohydrate, high fat ketogenic diet (irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-KD). A control group of animals without MD and fed a standard diet was also included (Table 1).  Diets were supplied as pellets (4RF21 standard diet and KD purchased by Mucedola Srl, Settimo Milanese, Italy) and administered for ten weeks after Postnatal Day (PND) 14 (Table 2).  Rats were checked every day, evaluating different parameters regarding the degree of suffering and stress-induced experimentally (namely, blepharospasm, hollow cheeks, abnormal position of the ears and the whiskers, appetite loss, and liquid stools). Each parameter was recorded, attributing a score from 0 (absent) to 2 (evident) to calculate the possible onset of pain and suffering.",eed2649e-3f52-44dd-bcbd-6f2be6f6b655
2,methods2,"  All animals in the study did not show any of the above parameters, except for a slowdown in the growth of puppies with MD, which showed lower weights than the control group puppies.  After treatment, the animals were sacrificed by anesthetic overdose, and colon samples were immediately removed and stored at −80 °C until assayed.  4.2. Western Immunoblotting  Protein extracts were obtained from colon tissue samples of control, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-Std, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-KD rats using standard procedure [7]. Aliquots of 50 µg of total protein extracts from each sample were loaded into 4–15% pre-cast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy) for western blot analysis. Anti-PrxIII (Ab FRONTIER, Seoul, Korea), anti-PGC-1α (Ab NOVUS, Centennial, CO, USA), anti-COX-2, anti-TLR-4, anti-PPAR-γ, anti-COX-4, anti-Beclin-1, anti-LC3, anti-VDAC1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) were used as primary antibodies.",e9b2e1fd-3253-41aa-a7c0-8b50b4bd63f2
3,methods3," The proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), and the densitometric analysis of each protein-related signal was obtained using the Molecular Imager ChemidocTM (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy) and normalized against β-actin expression.  4.3. SOD 1 and SOD 2 Levels  The [Cu-Zn] Superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) and the Mitochondrial Superoxide dismutase (SOD 2) levels in colon tissue samples from control and treated Wistar rats were evaluated using the Rat SOD 1 and Rat SOD 2 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)) Kits (Fine Test, Wuhan, China), respectively, following the manufacturer’s instructions.  4.4. Determination of mtDNA Content  Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to determine mtDNA content relative to β-actin nuclear gene, as reported in Chimienti et al. [27].",98a0d527-2e74-4319-88ad-c21641e69961
4,methods4," Briefly, 6 ng total DNA as template and the following primers: mtDNA for 5′GGTTCTTACTTCAGGGCCATCA3′ (nt 15,785-15,806), mtDNA Rev 5′TGATTAGACCCGTTACCATCGA3′ (nt 15,868-15,847) (numbering according to GenBankTM accession number AY172581, Rattus norvegicus, complete mitochondrial genome); β-actin For 5′CCCAGCCATGTACGTAGCCA3′ (nt 2181-2200), β-actin Rev 5′CGTCTCCGGAGTCCATCAC3′ (nt 2266-2248) (GenBankTM accession number V01217.1, Rattus norvegicus, β-actin gene) were used.  4.5. Modified Purines Analysis  Oxidized purines were detected using formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) digestion of total DNA, as in Chimienti et al. [27]. The PCR amplification of the D-loop mtDNA region was conducted using the following primers: D-loop for 5′TCTGGTCTTGTAAACCAAAAATGA3′ (nt 15,302-15,325), D-loop Rev 5′TGGAATTTTCTGAGGGTAGGC3′ (nt 16,302-16,282) (accession number AY172581, Rattus norvegicus, complete mitochondrial genome) and 7.",c2385b07-87c9-4901-8fc9-ff1e9727ba71
5,methods5,"5 ng of Fpg-treated or untreated total DNA. The Fpg-treated and untreated band intensities ratio was evaluated and expressed as the complement to 100 (%).  4.6. Statistical Analysis  Due to the non-normal distribution of the data, nonparametric tests were performed. Data were analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance and Dunn’s Multiple Comparison Test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. All data represent the results of at least two independent experiments and are expressed as mean ± SEM. A specific statistical package for the exact nonparametric inference package (StataCorp. 2005; Stata Statistical Software: Release 9, College Station, TX, USA) was used.
