0,methods0," 4.1. Animals and Brain Surgery  The experiments were carried out in compliance with the Animal Experiments Bill of January 21, 2005 (published in Journal of Laws no. 33/2005 item 289, Poland), and according to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. We also received approval from the Local Ethical Committee (947/2012; 1178/2015). All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals and their suffering.  Male Wistar HAN rats (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany), 3 months old at the beginning of the experiments, were kept at 12 h dark/light cycle (light from 06:00 to 18:00), 4–5 per cage, with free access to water and food.",974d1e61-3294-4c5a-90e8-667de0129d70
1,methods1," Control animals received normal diet (55% carbohydrates, 19% protein, 5% fat, fiber and ash as filling, calculated as weight %) while treated animals received ketogenic diet (1% carbohydrates, 8% protein, 70% fat, fiber and ash as filling, calculated as weight %) (Labofeed B standard and Labofeed B 70% fat, Wytwórnia Pasz Morawski, Kcynia, Poland, respectively). The main fat component was lard. The strict diet was kept for 3 weeks before the brain operations and maintained until the end of experiment. Body weight was monitored. Animal feces were systematically removed to avoid unwanted carbohydrate contamination due to coprophagy.  Stereotaxic brain operations were performed under ketamine and xylazine anesthesia (Biowet, Puławy, Poland) as published earlier [39]. Desipramine (15 mg/kg ip, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) was administered 30 min before lesioning to protect the noradrenergic terminals.",e08e3c91-afa5-494c-90ec-f6ced8f52c39
2,methods2," The animals were bilaterally injected with 6-OHDA HBr (3 μg base/3 μL per side), dissolved in a 0.2% ascorbic acid (both from Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) into the passing fibers of medial forebrain bundle (medial forebrain bundle (MFB)), at coordinates: AP: 1.4 mm, L: ±1.6 mm, V: 8.7 mm from bregma [81]. Control—sham-operated rats received solvent in the same way.  4.2. Behavioural Analysis Using Automated Actometers  Rat locomotor activity (path length, locomotion, and resting times) and rearings (total, free and supported number, duration) were measured at four time-points after operation (3, 5, 13, 27 days) using computerized actometers (ACTIFRAME-SYSTEM, GERB Elektronik GmbH, Berlin; Germany with ARNO software) as described before in detail by [35,82]. Animals were placed individually in cages with free access to food and water and analyzed for 18 h, consisting of both light and dark phases of the day.",6b9f087e-6b16-48cc-889c-3e40e08f4b2c
3,methods3," Each analysis session included animals from all treatment groups from the same post-operation day. If the same animal was tested twice, the analyses were at least 10 days apart.  4.3. HPLC-EC Analysis of DA, Its Metabolites, and Turnover Rates  Rats were decapitated at fourth, fourteenth, or twenty-eighth day after operation. Left STR and SN were immediately dissected and frozen on dry ice. The samples were weighed, homogenized, and deproteinized in 0.1 M perchloric acid. The levels of DA and its metabolites: 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)), 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), homovanillic acid (homovanillic acid (HVA)), as well as noradrenaline, serotonin (5-HT), and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were assessed using HPLC method with electrochemical detection, as published previously [55]. Samples were injected into the HPLC system (32 °C, column Hypersil Gold C18, 100 × 3.",0aaa49e4-f425-4c39-9a27-c61a12a9b773
4,methods4,"0 mm, 3 μm, (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and analytic cell 5010 Coulochem III, (ESA, Inc., Chelmsford, MA, USA)). The mobile phase was composed of 50 mM NaH2PO4 x 2H2O; 40 mM citric acid; 0.25 mM 1-octanesulfonic acid sodium salt; 0.25 mM EDTA; 1.3% acetonitrile; 2.4% methanol. The data were quantified using the area under the peaks and external standards with Chromeleon software (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The turnover was calculated as metabolite to neurotransmitter ratio.  4.4. Immunohistochemistry and Stereological Counting Neurons  Immunohistochemistry: After the decapitation, the right hemisphere of the brain was rapidly removed, post-fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 7 days, and cryoprotected in 20% sucrose solution in phosphate-buffered saline (phosphate buffered saline (PBS)). The brains were then cut on a freezing microtome into 25 μm frontal sections (AP –4.4 to 6.6 mm and AP = +2.2 to −1.",d2968b1e-6c80-4d7c-a015-f5868c5350e7
5,methods5,"5 mm from Bregma for SN pars compacta (SNc)—ventral tegmental area (VTA) and STR, respectively, according to Paxinos and Watson (2007)) by the principles of the stereological rules and stained as described before [56]. Free-floating sections were incubated for 48 h at 4 °C in primary antibodies (anti–tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), 1: 2’500) and in secondary antibodies (anti-mouse biotinylated, 1:200, Vector Laboratories, UK) for 30 min, processed using an ABC-peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), and 3,3’-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. Subsequently, the sections containing SNc—VTA stained for TH were counterstained with 1% cresyl violet (CV) with Nissl method. All sections were cover-slipped in a Permount medium (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).  Stereology: Neurons stained with TH+/CV+ and TH-/CV+ were counted stereologically in the SNc and VTA as described previously [83].",918a2684-0b2f-4d66-828e-6cd09814d8c8
6,methods6," The sampling of tissue was started at random from the beginning of the structure, systematic and uniform—every sixth section was taken. At least 8 sections through the entire length of the SNc and VTA, respectively, were sampled.  Stereological counting was performed using a light microscope (Leica, Denmark) equipped with a projecting camera (Basler Vision Technologies, Ahrensburg, Germany) and an automated stage (PRIOR ProScan) controlled by a newCAST (Visiopharm, Hørsholm, Denmark) software. The analyzed regions were outlined under lower magnification (5x), and their areas were estimated. The number of stained cells was calculated under 63x magnification using a randomized meander sampling and the optical dissector methods. The dissector’s height was 10 μm. The area of counting frame was 8302.8 μm2 and covered 30% of the screen area. Meander sampling probed 15% of the delineated regions of interest, resulting in counting not less than 150 cells from each animal.",63720a59-be7c-4105-9c3b-ee0589e3d7b7
7,methods7,"  Densitometry: The intensity of neuronal terminal TH staining in the STR was estimated by high-precision scans of sections (Scanner Epson Perfection V750 Pro, Seiko Epson Corporation, Nagano, Japan) using Multi Gauge software (Fujifilm Holdings Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Regions of interest were outlined, and mean quant level per area (QL/pixel2) was quantified from 10–12 sections per animal [56].  4.5. Quantitative Assays for Energy Metabolism Substrates  Tissue samples were homogenized in 0.1 M perchloric acid, and pH of supernatants was adjusted with KOH. The plasma was prepared by centrifugation. The assays for lactate and b-HB were performed on both tissue homogenates and plasma, using fluorescence PicoProbe kits, according to the manufacturer protocols (K638-100, K651-100, BioVision, Milpitas, CA, USA). Glucose assay on plasma samples was performed according to the manufacturer protocol (BIOLABO, Maizy, France).",20ef14f0-c593-4d3c-9ffe-ef2780c688ab
8,methods8," For signal detection on 96-well plates, a Tecan 200 Infinite spectrophotometer (Tecan Group, Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland) was used. Standard curves were prepared fresh on each well plate separately.  4.6. Mitochondrial Cx II and Cx IV Staining in the Tissue Sections  One brain hemisphere and liver were dissected immediately after decapitation and frozen in n-heptane at dry ice. A total of 10 μm tissue sections were stained as published before [37]: for total staining for Cx II (10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 1.5 mM nitrotetrazolium blue, 130 mM sodium succinate, 0.2 mM phenazine methosulfate, 1 mM sodium azide), or for non-specific staining (additionally with 130 mM malonate), and for Cx IV: total staining (50 mM disodium phosphate, 0.1 mM cytochrome c, 4 mM 3,3′-diaminobenzidine), or non-specific staining (additionally with 2 mM sodium azide).",b9b2ad63-4f44-412a-9c51-e3c09869fe52
9,methods9," After high-precision scanning (Scanner Epson Perfection V750 Pro, Seiko Epson Corporation, Nagano, Japan), the region of interest was outlined and analyzed densitometrically (Multi Gauge software, Fujifilm Holdings Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The results were presented as the mean of QL/pixel2 (Quantum Level).  4.7. Glycogen Detection in the Tissue Sections  Brain and liver 10 μm fresh frozen tissue sections were air-dried and incubated in 0.5% periodic acid. After washing in water, slides were incubated in Schiff reagent, washed again, dehydrated, and cover-slipped. Control sections were preincubated with 0.2% amylase at 37 °C for 30 min. Control staining was also performed with saturated solution of dimedone at 60 °C for 10 min. The intensity of glycogen staining was estimated on high-precision scans of tissue sections (Scanner Epson Perfection V750 Pro, Seiko Epson Corporation, Nagano, Japan) using Multi Gauge software (Fujifilm Holdings Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).",d7c0c0cb-ed0d-4a08-b043-1cb1cbf229fd
10,methods10," Regions of interest were outlined, and mean quant level per area (QL/pixel2) was quantified from 2–3 sections per animal.  4.8. Western Blot  Frozen tissue samples were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris; 150 mM NaCl; 1% NP-40; 0.1% SDS; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; pH 7.4) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as published before [35,36,37]. Protein concentration in supernatants was determined using PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Protein samples were denatured and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Transfer to 0.2 µm PVDF membranes (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was performed with semi-dry, discontinuous buffer system in Trans-Blot® TurboTM (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).",6079c731-1380-4337-96af-0f7e9ef2e3f2
11,methods11,"  Blots were probed with primary antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (MAB5280, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (sc-271029), glucokinase (glucose utilization (GCK)) (sc-17819) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) (ab83690) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) (sc-166545) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). Secondary anti-mouse/goat (sc-2005) or anti-rabbit/goat (sc-2005) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used. Detection was performed using chemiluminescence solution (0.1 M Tris; 5.3 mM H2O2; 1.25 mM luminol; 2.0 M 4-iodophenylboronic acid) [84]. PEPC, glucose utilization (GCK), and G6PC were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression.",8301cdc7-839f-445a-b6cd-54de09c8b2cb
12,methods12," Analysis was performed in triplicate for each animal, from n = 6 animals per group. After TH immunodetection, the membranes were stained with Coomassie blue, and total protein staining in a lane was used as a loading control for each sample as described in [85].  4.9. Statistical Analysis  Results are presented as mean ± standard errors of mean (standard errors of mean (SEM)). The statistical analysis of results was performed using STATISTICA 10.0 software (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). p ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant, and 0.1 ≥ p ≥ 0.05 were considered as trends. Analyses were performed by 3-way factorial ANOVA with Fisher Least Significant Difference post hoc test or 2-way ANOVA with LSD post hoc test and t-test for comparison of groups in time. For motor behavior analysis, repeated measures test was used. All groups consisted of 5–8 animals, and for behavioral studies, 8–26 animals.  5.",2aefce09-cdf3-4864-8e49-1f571c405bc7
13,methods13," Conclusions  Our results do not confirm the neuroprotective effect of a ketogenic diet or hyperketonemia in the 6-OHDA-induced animal model of PD. Increased level of ketone bodies in the brain and plasma was not enough to provide neuroprotection in this PD model; therefore, additional processes must be involved. Probably, the decreased glucose level and/or tissue sensitivity to glucose or insulin is a more important factor than the ketone support itself. Our further hypothesis could be that ketogenic energy support could be relevant in diseases where astrocytic energy support is decreased towards the neurons. Further differences between human and animal responses to the ketogenic diet should be taken into consideration. Caution should be taken when applying a stringent long-term ketogenic diet to elderly PD patients as it could negatively impact liver functioning.",11b86753-40f4-4325-8620-762432996430
14,methods14," A ketogenic diet, besides, epilepsy would probably be more effective in Alzheimer’s disease [86] and mitochondrial deficits diseases rather than in PD.
