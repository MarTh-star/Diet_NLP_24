0,introduction0," Congenital disorder of glycosylation (Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG)) is a rapidly expanding group of metabolic disorders of glycan biosynthesis or assembly. Most of more than 140 types of Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG)s discovered so far have neurologic phenotype, and can affect any other organs or systems depending on the specific Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) types (Chang et al., 2018; Ng and Freeze, 2018). Located in Xp11.23, SLC35A2 gene (OMIM∗314375) encodes solute carrier family 35 member 2 protein (UDP−galactose transporter, SLC35A2) in humans responsible for transporting UDP-galactose from the cytosol to lumens of Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum for glycosylation . Inactivation of SLC35A2 gene in mammalian cell models caused total absence of UDP−galactose traffic into the Golgi apparatus leading to synthesis of truncated glycans lacking galactose .",b57e7bd1-4268-4927-ae30-513cc48329a9
1,introduction1," In humans, SLC35A2-Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) (OMIM#300896, formerly known as Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) type IIm) is caused by heterozygous de novo mutations in SLC35A gene and mostly affect female gender due to X−chromosome inactivation. Clinical phenotypes include infantile-onset seizure, global development delay, facial dysmorphism, abnormal liver function, and skeletal abnormalities. Since the first report of SLC35A2-Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) in 2013 , 54 de novo variants from 63 cases have been reported in the literature (Kodera et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2013, 2019; EuroEPINOMICS-Res Consortium, Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project, and Epi4K Consortium., 2014; Dörre et al., 2015; Bosch et al., 2016; Lopes et al., 2016; The Undiagnosed Disease Network, 2016; Evers et al., 2017; Kimizu et al., 2017; Westenfield et al., 2018; Yates et al., 2018; Miyamoto et al., 2019; Vals et al., 2019).",8eb598ca-75e4-4004-9797-adecb2b2387b
2,introduction2," However, no patient has been reported from mainland China in English literature. Here we report four new patients with typical features of SLC35A2-Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) from China, and expand genotypic as well as phenotypic features with novel findings.

3,methods0," Patient Recruitment and Literature Analysis  The Ethics Committee of the Children’s Hospital of Fudan University approved this study. We retrospectively analyzed clinical phenotype and SLC35A2 genotype of four cases (P1–P4) from four unrelated families. Three patients (P1, P2, and P3), were treated in the Department of Hepatology, Children’s Hospital of Fudan University from January, 2017 to July, 2020, and were asked to fill out questionnaire with phenotypes related to SLC35A2-Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). P2 and P3 signed an informed consent before recommending oral D-galactose therapy. Pubmed searches were conducted at 11 June 2020 using key words such as SLC35A2, UDP-galactose transporter (species were filtered for humans), but no reports from Mainland China were found.",a75fc962-9ed7-4fa3-b6ed-0485870d2bc0
4,methods1," We also conducted Chinese language literature search by using the CNKI (China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database1) and Wanfang Database2 and collected a case report of SLC35A2-Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) (P4) in Chinese medical literature. We also analyzed all reported cases of SLC35A2-Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) in English literature.  Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis  SLC35A2 gene variants were identified either through whole exome sequencing (whole exome sequencing (WES)), panel sequencing, or copy number variant (CNV)-seq analysis by using the NM_001042498.2 transcript and checked against the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD®) Professional3. P1 had trio-whole exome sequencing (WES) by FindRare (a commercial genetic testing company4, using Illumina platform and NextGene V2.3.4 software) (Figure 1A).",875f185c-0e61-45fa-8f2c-85873577d2f6

P3 had Epilepsy panel sequencing with parental confirmation by a commercial medical testing company called Kangso Medical Inspection6 (Figure 1C). P4 was reported to be identified through simultaneous whole exome sequencing (WES) of the index patient, parents, maternal grandmother, and maternal uncle using Illumina Nextseq 500 sequencer. Novelty of SLC35A2 gene variants were checked against dbSNP1527, 1000 Genome Database8, Exome Variant Server9, and gnomAD10. Location of large deletion on the SLC35A2 gene is confirmed with Mutalyzer 2.0.30 Position Converter11. Pathogenicity of genetic variants were predicted by online tools such as MutationTaster12, CADD13, SIFT Indel14, and M-CAP15.",64003dfa-f487-4131-a540-ad3c7f891d49

P1 was a full-term female born after uneventful pregnancy (except for mild oligohydramnios), and delivery was uncomplicated except for a lower birthweight (2,350 g, 1st centile by WHO standards). She presented with seizure at the age of 3 months, hypsarrhythmia in electroencephalogram (EEG) indicated infantile spasms. Seizures significantly improved after treatment with topiramate and vigabatrin. However, epilepsy was not controlled despite therapies with multiple anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), adrenocorticotropic hormone (adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)), and ketogenic diet. She was diagnosed with infantile spasm, epileptic encephalopathy, and psychomotor developmental delay. Brain MRI at the age of 5 months showed delayed myelination, slight enlargement of bilateral lateral ventricles and frontal subarachnoid spaces. At the age of 8.",38f1f8ae-b4e0-441a-94a8-a31702835cbf

P2 is the first child of non-consanguineous parents born after full-term pregnancy (38 weeks and 2 days) with normal birthweight (2,950 g, 26th centile) and length (49 cm, 47th centile). Maternal history was positive for pre-conceptional hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism during pregnancy. Newborn period was uneventful except for significant hyperbilirubinemia and phototherapy. She presented with hypertonia, developmental delay, and seizures at the age of 5 months. EEG showed hypsarrhythmia and multifocal discharges on both temporal and occipital lobes. Physical examination was positive for increased muscle tone on extremities, smaller left ear with extra folds on both earlobes. Seizures were not responsive to topiramate and sodium valproate, but could be partly controlled with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) therapy.",02418270-efe5-4a1c-be30-01f9e0f7a098
11,results3," EEG at the age of 7 months was abnormal. Other abnormal findings include mild hypertransaminasemia (ALT/AST 42/52U/L, normal range 0–30 U/L), and mild lactic acidosis (3.1 mmol/L, normal range 0–2 mmol/L). Trio-whole exome sequencing (WES) was negative, but chromosome microarray analysis identified a de novo large deletion leading to the absence of the exon 1 and exon 2 (Xp11.23del2.14kb, c.-322_c.274+1del) in the SLC35A2 gene. She and her healthy father (as normal control) were screened for carbohydrate deficient transferrin by iso-electric focusing. When compared to her father’s normal profile, P3 had increased levels of transferrin glycosylated with monosialic and asialic acids (Figure 1B). Normal findings include lymphocyte sub-population, creatine kinase, thyroid function test, electrocardiography, brain MRI, chest X-ray, T-spot TB test, full blood count, serum amino-acid with acylcarnitine profiling, and urine organic acids.",a2bdbaab-47be-4bca-a6c6-f267b0eba91a
12,results4," She received gradual increase of oral D-galactose therapy (a health supplement produced by Vita-World GmbH, Germany20) starting with 0.5 g/kg∗day (divided into five doses), and adding 0.5 g/kg∗day in 6 weeks with a final dosage of 1.5 g/kg∗day from the age of 11 months (as recommended by a clinical trial protocol, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02955264). When followed up at the age of 22 months, she achieved seizure control with minimal EEG abnormality with slight improvement in both motor and language skills.  P3 was a full-term female infant with normal birthweight (3,100 g, 38th centile) born to non-consanguineous parents. Neonatal period was uneventful except for phototherapy due to hyperbilirubinemia. She developed seizures at the age of 10 months, EEG results were suggestive of infantile spasm (intermittent hypsarrhythmia with focal sharp waves on temporal-occipital lobe).",9d58b8de-293f-4840-8244-a70047867100
13,results5," Infantile spasm improved with ketogenic diet, but there was no improvement on abnormal EEG pattern after 3 months. She was found to have de novo frameshift mutation (c.781delC/p.Arg289ValfsTer88) on trio-whole exome sequencing (WES) (Figure 1C). Normal test results included liver function test, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, renal function test, serum electrolytes, full blood count, serum amino-acids with acylcarnitine profiling, urine organic acids, and brain MRI. Psychomotor developmental milestones were within normal range. After signing an informed consent for glycosylation study and oral D-galactose treatment, parents send blood samples of the child and parents to our institution. Seizure activities are controlled 6 months after galactose therapy.  P4 is a 10-month-old girl recently reported in the Chinese literature .

However, one patient (P1) in our cohort had anemia and hypertriglyceridemia, while another patient (P2) had hypertonia. All of which have never been reported in previous reports and could be novel phenotypes of SLC35A2-Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). Previously reported pregnancy complications included fetal skeletal dysplasias, pericardial effusions, decreased fetal movements, and breech presentation. New findings on pregnancy complications in our cohort include conceptional oligohydramnios (P1) and conceptional hypothyroidism (P2). For the first time, we reported an SLC35A2-Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) patient with concomitant Marfan syndrome (P4).",db315483-b304-45d8-8048-ab89d37642c7

Canonical splice-site mutations (c.-322_c.274+1del), large deletions (c.781delC/p.Arg261ValfsTer88), and frameshift mutations (c.781delC/p.Arg261ValfsTer88 and c.601delG/p.Ala201GlnfsTer148) may also cause absence of the protein product through non-sense-mediated mRNA decay (non sense mediated mRNA decay (NMD)) (Hu and Ng, 2012). Previously, only two splice site mutations have been reported (c.274+2T > C and c.274+1T > C) to be associated with SLC35A2-Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) . The c.426+1G > A variant in P1 is a canonical exon 3 splicing donor site mutation that usually causes skipping of Exon 4 during transcription and translation (Maszczak-Seneczko et al., 2011; Shibata et al.",33b0d0db-ac69-4f27-ba44-9e9a7dba1b2f

However, transferrin isoelectric focusing (IEF) screening in some patients showed normal patterns during earlier or later years of disease course (9 out of 15) . P2 in our cohort had abnormal type II pattern with increased levels of asialated, monosialated, disialated, and trisialated transferrins. Mass spectrometry (MS) of N-glycans showed loss of galactose in one study , and partial loss of galactose and sialic acid of the N−linked glycans of serum transferrin was observed in other studies .  Assays using Streptolysin-O-permeabilized fibroblasts from patients (Ng et al.",b50a150b-5195-4359-9af1-e8757c3fca9f
29,discussion10,", 2013), glycoside−based UDP−galactose transport assays with primary fibroblast lines from patients , or a novel assay using the binding of bacterial Shiga toxins (Li and Mukhopadhyay, 2019) can be used to evaluate SLC35A2 enzyme activity. Deleterious mutations in our cohort have high likelihood of leading to complete loss of enzyme activity. Effects of variants found in our patients on enzyme activity need to be confirmed by similar assays.  There is no disease-specific treatment for SLC35A2-Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) that proven to be effective, but oral galactose supplementation may improve residual enzyme activity by providing extra substrate. Dörre et al. (2015) reported reduced seizure activity and improved transferrin isoelectric focusing (IEF) pattern after 100 days of oral galactose therapy (1 g/kg∗day, divided into five doses) in a 6-months-old infant.",2816616d-c09d-4fbd-bd10-4f5ada7a458f
30,discussion11," Same efficacy may be achieved when the galactose was administered as a single morning dosage without having additional side effect . P2 and P3 achieved seizure control with minimal EEG abnormality after gradual increase of oral D-galactose up to 1.5 g/kg∗day (starting with 0.5 g/kg∗day and adding 0.5 g/kg∗day in 6 weeks). P4 had improved motor development, reduced seizure activity, and improved EEG patterns after receiving 1 g/kg∗day (divided to eight doses in a day) of oral galactose supplement.  Due to retrospective nature of this study, some limitations could not be avoided. Limitations in our study include lack of functional studies to confirm effects of mutations on protein function, N-glycan analysis for the confirmation of glycosylation defect, and transferrin isoelectric focusing (IEF) for P1, P3, and P4 for the screening of glycosylation defect.",d776b398-a654-4077-8296-ff71129b4c57
31,discussion12," Nevertheless, we believe that the available information should be sufficient for the diagnosis of SLC35A2-Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG).  In summary, we expanded genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of SLC35A2-CD by reporting first four patients with novel SLC35A2 gene variants and novel phenotypes from mainland China.
