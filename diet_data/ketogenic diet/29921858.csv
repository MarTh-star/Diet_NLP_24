0,methods0,"Details of this investigation have been described previously [3]. A minimum sample size of 9 participants per group was calculated using G*Power version 3.1.9.4. (Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany), with reference to dietary intake data reported in similar ketogenic research [23]. In brief, 47 male endurance athletes aged 19–40 years participated in a 12-week non-randomised control trial, comparing performance. All participants competed in endurance events (>2 years), were 18–40 years of age and habitually consumed a HC diet (~50% of total calories). Twenty participants completed all aspects of the dietary and training intervention [3], whilst a total blood count was performed on 19 participants (HC n 10, low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) n 9), due to insufficient blood sample from 1 participant. All procedures were approved by the research ethics committee at Waterford Institute of Technology and all participants provided written informed consent.",4de4cf25-5784-4787-a694-721d962ee644
1,methods1," The study is registered with the ISRCTN registry as number ISRCTN70987680 (direct link to registered study information: https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN70987680).  2.1. Dietary Intervention Food diaries were obtained at baseline using a 3-day weighed food diary (2 week days and 1 weekend day). These were analyzed using Nutritics dietary analysis software (Nutritics Professional v3.09, Nutritics, Dublin, Ireland). The macronutrient goals were: HC 65% carbohydrate, 20% fat and 14% protein or low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) >75% fat, 10–15% protein and <50 g/d carbohydrate. At the outset, participants in each group received a nutritional handout, detailing how best to formulate their diet according to daily energy requirements. Participants in each group received nutritional counselling throughout the 12-week intervention. Example meal plans for the HC and low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) groups are detailed in Table 1.",cbbfa9a7-889d-43c8-92e6-4303be8fed57
2,methods2,"  Participants were contacted weekly to ensure dietary adherence and a weighed food diary was submitted each week. Three-day food diaries were also obtained in week 12 and analysed using the Nutritics dietary analysis software. Average nutrient intake, including GL and potential renal acid load (potential renal acid load (PRAL)) for 3 days pre- and post-dietary intervention were obtained from the dietary analysis report.   2.2. Blood Analysis Fasting blood samples (following 48 h rest from training) were collected into an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) tube from an antecubital vein using a 21G needle (BD Diagnostics, Dublin, Ireland) at pre- and post-intervention testing, subsequent to a 12-h overnight fast. Blood samples were put through a haematology analyser (Beckman Coulter AcT diff Analyzer, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) 20–30 min subsequent to collection.",b3dc30c6-0366-4864-8277-6313565593ff
3,methods3," The haematology analyser measured participant’s white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, red blood cells, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (mean corpuscular volume (MCV)), mean corpuscular width (mean corpuscular width (MCW)), red blood cell distribution width (red blood cell distribution width (RDW)) and platelet content. Serum ferritin was measured pre and post intervention via Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)) (GmbH, Aachen, Germany). Intra-assay coefficient of variation was 3.9–9.9 ng/mL.  2.3. Net Endogenous Acid Production Net endogenous acid production (Net endogenous acid production (NEAP)) was quantified using protein and potassium intakes at pre- and post-intervention testing, using two algorithms [24].

Subject Characteristics Baseline subject characteristics presented in Table 2 [3] demonstrate no difference in age, height or BMI between HC and low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants.  3.2. Nutrient Changes over Intervention Period Table 3 presents mean nutrient intake for HC and low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) groups, as well as recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for European citizens [25], from the World Health Organisation (World Health Organisation (WHO)) [26,27] and for endurance athletes [28,29]. No changes in intake of energy, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, niacin, folic acid, vitamin C, potential renal acid load (potential renal acid load (PRAL)) or caffeine took place across the intervention period. As expected, carbohydrate consumption decreased and fat increased in the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) group, causing a reduction in GL.",d20c1309-3236-4fcf-9c91-4e01c79b690e
6,methods6," Protein remained unchanged in the HC group and increased in low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants across the intervention period.   Additional energy from dietary fat resulted in increases in energy from saturated fat in the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) group, while the HC group reduced saturated fat intake. Omega 3:6 ratio remained unchanged within HC participants, but increased within low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants. Intake of fibre, free sugar, sodium, chloride, magnesium, iron, copper and thiamine decreased within low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants, but was unchanged in HC participants. Intakes of selenium, vitamin A, D, E, K1, B12, riboflavin and biotin increased within low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants.",115b3b1b-968a-4133-9494-df3114091e63
7,methods7," at P < 0 05 Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) demonstrated a significant difference in post-intervention intakes of pantothenic acid and vitamin B6, with higher intakes within the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) group. Within HC participants, intake of manganese increased while intakes of iodine and vitamins A, D, riboflavin and B12 decreased with increased carbohydrate focus within the diet.  3.3. Net Endogenous Acid Production (Net endogenous acid production (NEAP)) Table 4 presents Net endogenous acid production (NEAP) values for HC and low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) groups. There were no differences between groups Net endogenous acid production (NEAP)1 and Net endogenous acid production (NEAP)2 at baseline. Consumption of an low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) increased Net endogenous acid production (NEAP)1 (P = 0.038) and caused a difference between groups at post-intervention testing (P = 0.041).",e316512d-7a4d-4013-8345-c21b187298db
8,methods8," No changes in Net endogenous acid production (NEAP)2 were observed.   3.4. Blood Analysis Table 5 presents changes in blood measures for HC and low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) groups. Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH)C both decreased in the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) group. No other significant changes were observed, but a medium effect size in red blood cell distribution width (RDW) occurred within low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD).  4. Discussion Examination of nutrient density within endurance athletes who adhered to a HC or low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) revealed consumption of a HC diet resulted in greater intakes of fibre, sugar, sodium, chloride, magnesium, iron, copper, manganese and thiamine, with higher GL, compared to low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) consumption.",6bae2b19-c8c8-4df7-97c0-f6b87843eff9
9,methods9," Conversely, free-living consumption of a low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) resulted in greater intake of saturated fat, protein, a higher omega 3:6 ratio and greater intakes of selenium, vitamins A, D, E, K1, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, B12, B6, biotin and higher Net endogenous acid production (NEAP). Blood analysis revealed consumption of a low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) for 12 weeks reduced Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH)C amongst low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants, but no change in iron stores were evident.   The American College of Sports Medicine advocates a nutrient dense HC diet with appropriate energy for optimal sports performance and health amongst endurance athletes [29].",b3890386-5b8a-4c63-b4de-ad688e39dd3d
10,methods10," However, metabolic adaptations such as decreased reliance on carbohydrates [3,5,23,31], and improvements in power to weight ratio [3,7] have made a low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) a desirable approach for some endurance athletes.   Despite the HC group within this research increasing carbohydrate intake, levels were still marginally below the 6–12 g·kg recommended range for endurance athletes exercising 1–3 h a day [28]. This is contrary to a review which found male athletes generally achieve their carbohydrate recommendations [32]. Notably, however, Burke et al. [32] included competition dietary intakes where energy and carbohydrate requirements are greater. In contrast, participants’ food diaries within the current investigation were obtained during the final week of a training intervention, when participants’ completed 11.7 ± 1.7 h of endurance training/week [3].",e1aadc61-e22c-4fd2-bdc4-20ed338c33de
11,methods11," Another factor which likely contributed to sub-optimal carbohydrate intake was prioritisation of whole foods, resulting in a high fibre intake. Gastrointestinal limits to bulky, high-fibre foods, such as whole grains products and potatoes, are reported to impede optimal carbohydrate intakes [28]. By design, carbohydrate intake within the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) group was significantly beneath this threshold (0.5 g·kg) in order to induce a state of nutritional ketosis (i.e., elevate blood ketones to >0.5 mmol/L) [15]. When adopting an low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD), individuals exclude many foods high in fibre, such as cereals and wholegrain products.",69880fc5-04c6-4bc4-b450-bc6fbec101cf
12,methods12," However on a well-formulated low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) [15], green leafy fibrous vegetables, nuts, seeds and low-carbohydrate fruits such as avocados are nutritious sources of fibre, and should be encouraged to prevent sub-optimal fibre intake, observed upon low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) consumption within the current research.   Post-intervention protein intake significantly differed between groups, with protein intake within the HC group slightly below the 1.4–2.0 g·kg range recommended for endurance athletes [33]. However, neither group experienced loss of lean body mass (lean body mass: HC = +0.1 kg and low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) = +0.3 kg, P > 0.05, ES: 0.068) [3], which is a good indication each group was consuming adequate energy and protein across the intervention period.   Dietary fat increased to 77.2% energy intake within low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants and non-significantly decreased to 18.",12e2590f-5d34-4f33-ac43-4db2f466a15b
13,methods13,"6% energy intake within HC participants. Following a popular publication in lay press [15], this investigation encouraged consumption of foods containing monounsaturated (e.g., nuts, avocados, olive oil) and saturated fats (e.g., fatty animal meat, butter, coconut oil) and less so foods containing polyunsaturated fats (e.g., soy and corn oil). This was reflected within participants reported diets, as monounsaturated (34.2% total energy) and saturated fat (29.5% total energy) comprised ~63.7% of total energy. Long-term high saturated fat intake is an important consideration in nutrition. A robust relationship between saturated fat and health is not settled in science [34]. Participants within the current research were endurance athletes, consuming an low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD).",3512b015-4db4-4d57-8349-9aac67adeeb8
14,methods14," These saturated fatty acids derived from butter and coconut oil are rich in short- and medium-chain fatty acids, which have been suggested to be easier to oxidize compared to long-chain fatty acids [35], hence high saturated fat intake in the context of an low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) within an endurance athlete population, may not be problematic [36].   Increases in saturated fat occurred in the presence of increased polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, within low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants, with improved omega 3:6 ratio. A low omega 3:6 ratio is pro-inflammatory and thought to accelerate pathogenesis of chronic diseases, such as CVD, cancer and autoimmune diseases [37,38]. Hence, an increased omega 3:6 fatty acid ratio within the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) is desirable.",ea5770f5-b9f1-4c03-b48d-3f688401b5af
15,methods15," Within HC participants, increased emphasis should be placed on the importance of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats to improve omega 3:6 ratios, and achieve appropriate fat recommendations within endurance athletes [39].   Thiamine consumption decreased in the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) group, but was still above the recommended intake threshold. This was not surprising, as wholegrain foods are the predominant sources. However, as outlined by Zinn et al. [14] in the context of a low-carbohydrate high-fat diet containing ~80 g/d of carbohydrates, one must question if an individual’s thiamine requirements are reduced, as one of the key functions of thiamine is the metabolism of carbohydrates [40]. It is important athletes consuming a ketogenic diet are aware of the importance of consuming thiamine-rich foods.",b676448c-f1c4-4813-9cbf-7205a825d6b9
16,methods16,"  During our assessment, low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants had greater intakes of Vitamins A, D, K1, pantothenic acid, biotin and vitamin B12 compared to HC participants. Vitamin D insufficiency is common in athletic populations and dietary interventions are often unsuccessful at remedying deficiencies [41], although the current participants upon low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) consumption achieved sufficient dietary Vitamin D intake. Average intakes of vitamin B12 range from 4.2–8.6 µg/d in adults; however, intakes in males are higher in a number of European countries [25], but not considered harmful [42]. Although only a snapshot of HC participants diets, vitamin A and B12 consumption within the current group was below recommended levels for European males [25]. Individuals following a HC diet should be advised to keep dietary fat ~20–30% of total energy, with sufficient diet variety, to ensure a diverse range of vitamins.",6ab3261c-6b77-4314-89ed-0f1036fedd9f
17,methods17," A recent position stand from the American College of Sports Medicine stated there is no performance benefit to consuming <20% of total energy from fat [29].   Electrolyte balance is an important consideration when working with any athlete; however, when following an low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD), it is paramount that athletes take additional measures to ensure adequate hydration, as the absorption of glucose across the intestinal wall is dependent on sodium, with the involvement of a sodium/glucose co-transporter [43]. Low-carbohydrate experts recommend consuming ~5000 mg/d of sodium on an low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) to preclude orthostatic symptoms [15]. Therefore, low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants were recommended to supplement sodium at meal times (i.e., table salt), consume electrolytes when exercising and consume 1–2 g/d of sodium from bouillon cubes or homemade broth [3].",f238aa92-32da-4e5d-b5df-6388368c775b
18,methods18," Additionally, low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants were advised to salvage nutrient-dense meat drippings when cooking to garnish dishes and recommended to grill meat and steam vegetables, as magnesium and other nutrients can be spoiled through boiling/evaporation [15]. Despite these measures, low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants reported sodium intake was sub optimal, while they consumed adequate potassium and magnesium. Orthostatic symptoms were not reported to the researcher subsequent to the first 0–2 weeks of the intervention, when participants’ were still developing new dietary routines and physiologically adapting to their new lifestyle. Thus, low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participant’s daily intake of sodium was sufficient to preclude orthostatic symptoms in trained individuals in the current research.",380da648-47e1-4e3b-a5bd-d79f884107be
19,methods19," It is most likely that low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants poorly reported their added salt (sodium) at mealtimes, most probably underestimating or omitting discretional salt intake. Appropriate sodium, potassium and magnesium intakes are necessary to achieve water balance and maintain nerve and muscle function [15], and vital in endurance athletes when electrolyte balance is threatened due to sweating. Phosphorus, magnesium, iron and copper were consumed in significantly higher amounts by HC participants with lower amounts consumed by the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) group.   Iron deficiencies, even in the absence of anaemia can impair muscle function [44], which in an athletic population can attribute to poor work capacity and poor training adaptations [29].",eba319af-e569-4e42-851a-4b49e3fd962b
20,methods20," Iron intakes met the requirements for the general population in each group, but decreases observed within the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) meant their intake was below the RDA specific for endurance athletes (~19 mg/d) [29]. This is similar to previous research reporting reduced iron intake in an low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) diet compared to a HC diet amongst athletes [21]. A well-formulated ketogenic diet, including organ meat, red meat, eggs and green leafy vegetables should provide sufficient iron intake, hence the participants within the current investigation may not have consumed a sufficient variety of these advised foods. Of additional concern, low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants observed decreases in copper intake.",9b869565-3e29-42fc-b9c8-cb0503cf2b6d
21,methods21," A recent article highlighted the development of copper-deficiency anaemia in a child transitioning from a formula-based low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) to a pureed food-based low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD), with the deficiency being rectified by copper supplementation [45]. Similar to iron, reduced variety in food intake may have resulted in reduced copper intake within low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants, as such it is paramount this aspect is emphasized to anyone adopting an low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD). Organ meat, nuts, soy-products, beans and sea-food are all high in copper, so when included within a low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) should provide sufficient intake. Post-intervention, the HC groups haemoglobin count was >13.0 g/dL, a recommended threshold set for healthy males [46].",797451bd-9018-419f-a5e9-c1f33bd7e786
22,methods22," In contrast, post-intervention haemoglobin was below the ~13 mg/dL threshold within the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) group, placing low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants marginally above the mild anaemia threshold (i.e., 11–12.9 g/dL) [46]. This is in contrast to Kose et al. [18], where increases in haematological parameters were observed upon low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) consumption, but participants were not endurance athletes, nor was iron intake of study participants reported. McKay et al. [21] reported increased pre-exercise haemoglobin levels within athletes, upon low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) diet consumption in comparison to a HC diet. However, this research was 3-weeks long [21] compared to the current study which was 12 weeks.",2119d142-c21a-4e25-9b31-3eba248e5672
23,methods23," In addition, low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants’ experienced decreases in Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH)C but remained within the normal range; however, haematocrit concentrations in each group were low. These findings are not uncommon among trained individuals, Sharpe et al. [47] found that 85% of females and 22% of males in a cohort of >1000 people had haematocrit of <0.42. Additionally, vitamin C intake within the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) group was 21.8% below the recommended daily intake, as a low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) is limited in fruit intake. Ascorbic acid has a dose-dependent enhancing effect on iron absorption in humans [48].",c3080d16-4648-4437-bcbb-f6be1533ff72
24,methods24," In light of low haemoglobin/haematocrit count and decreased Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH)C within the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD), further analysis examined whether decreased iron impacted serum ferritin concentrations. There is no agreed definition as to the concentration of serum ferritin which constitutes a problematic level of iron depletion, but expert opinions range from <10 to <35 ng/mL [29,49]. Despite aforementioned concerns, serum ferritin concentrations remained unchanged within the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) group, with concentrations of serum ferritin in each group being considerably greater than deficiency thresholds previously outlined [29,49]. In response to exercise, serum ferritin may increase through the inflammatory response [50]. However, inflammation is thought to not play a role within the current investigation, since blood samples were taken 48 h after rest.",b723f973-b043-4acb-a5d8-083d9de81dcf
25,methods25," Previous research has demonstrated similar pre-exercise IL-6 levels following low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) or HC diet consumption [21]. Zinn et al. [14] highlighted that iron bioavailability is reduced by phytates, given a low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) is free of foods high in phytates, such as wholegrains, it is not inconceivable to postulate that persons following an low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) could have increased iron bioavailability. However, likewise, it is possible 12-weeks exercise training on a KD could have resulted in increased inflammation, in comparison to HC diet consumption, as previously reported [21], which could have affected the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin [21], reducing iron status over time. Similar to the conclusion drawn by McKay et al. [21], this is speculative, with further research required to understand the process by which a LC diet could affect iron status in athletes.",72177ad1-06e6-4575-ba25-cb7ba5d56bc4
26,methods26,"   Interest in potential renal acid load (PRAL) and Net endogenous acid production (NEAP) experienced a renaissance when Net endogenous acid production (NEAP) calculations were included in a recent manuscript in elite endurance athletes [47]. Similar to the investigation by Carr et al. [51], Net endogenous acid production (NEAP)1 increased following a period of keto-adaptation and was greater than the HC groups estimated Net endogenous acid production (NEAP)1 score at post-intervention testing. Unlike Carr et al. [51], investigation, blood bicarbonate and pH were not measured, but participants contained within the current investigation had similar potential renal acid load (PRAL) scores at post-intervention testing and previously experienced similar blood lactate responses to the HC group throughout a 100 km TT and subsequent to a maximal exercise test [3].",46e4cc84-8aa0-4c85-9e8b-f31926ee046a
27,methods27," An investigation in ultra-marathon runners demonstrated that participants experienced simultaneous increases in blood pH and lactate during a 100 km running trial [52]. This investigation lacks the specificity of Carr et al. [51]; however, one could postulate based on potential renal acid load (PRAL) scores and the homogeneity of HC and low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) participants lactate responses during exercise [3] that non-elite-endurance-trained individuals may possess the same “blood buffering capacity” as elite athletes following a 12-week adaptation to an low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD), although a more thorough investigation which examines changes in blood bicarbonate and pH is required.   This investigation has a number of limitations, namely (1) small sample size, (2) findings are limited to the population sample at hand (i.e., male endurance athletes), (3) findings may be limited to the geographical and cultural location (i.e.",892129a4-b277-41fb-8233-bd3c02c384d1
28,methods28,", Ireland), (4) this analysis is based on nutrient intakes reported over 3 days, for each time-point. Although judgments of deficiency and inadequacy cannot be made from such acute assessments (e.g., HC post Zn, I, vitamin A; low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) post Zn, Ca), particularly when evidence is provided by dietary recall/food diaries [53], long-term implications of such intakes are an important consideration. (5) dietary analysis software may lack the delicacy to identify nutrients lost or salvaged through various cooking methods (i.e., grilling versus boiling).   5. Conclusions and Recommendations Noteworthy findings were the low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD) groups reported reduced iron intake and reduced Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH)C, but maintenance of serum ferritin.",9181eab6-ad4a-4857-9496-a84331c3d328
29,methods29," This may re-highlight a limitation previously outlined (accuracy of food diaries) or perhaps, that iron bioavailability is increased on a low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKD). Irrespective of dietary approach, endurance athletes should be made aware of the dangers of low iron and encouraged to monitor blood work with a medical professional. In an attempt to increase their carbohydrate intake, HC participants restricted dietary fat to <20% of total energy, with low intakes of essential vitamins, namely vitamin A, D, E and vitamin B12. Therefore, individuals following a HC diet should be advised to keep dietary fat to >20–30% of total calories and to prioritise polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids to ensure a diverse range of fat-soluble vitamins. Additionally, nutritional guidelines recommend macronutrient intakes (g·kg) to optimise performance [28,29,54].",06cfaa6d-f2ca-4a74-bf60-85220510e65f
30,methods30," Although not always the case [29], some editions of nutritional guidelines recommend “nutrient-rich carbohydrate foods” but fail to stipulate forms [28,29]. These guidelines may be taken out of context, which may lead athletes to overly concentrate on energy and macronutrient intake (g·kg) and to prioritise carbohydrate-dense foods such as pastas, breads and cereals, which lack the micronutrient density of less calorically and carbohydrate-dense foods such as fruits and green leafy fibrous vegetables, as observed within the current investigation. Therefore, athletes adhering to a HC diet should be reminded to consume a diet with appropriate micronutrient density [25], as well as adhering to sports-specific macronutrient guidelines [28,29,54]. Finally, athlete-specific vitamin and mineral recommendations have not been designed. The current research utilizes the majority of nutrient recommendations designed for the general population.",0d3bd37c-2a96-49d5-8355-78127d92aa0c
