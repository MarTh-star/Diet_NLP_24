0,introduction0," Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder that causes dementia and affects millions of people worldwide. Although it has devastating outcomes for patients and tremendous economic costs to society, there is currently no effective treatment available.  Aims  The high‐fat, low‐carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) is an established treatment for refractory epilepsy with a proven efficacy. Although the considerable interest has emerged in recent years for applying KD in AD patients, only few interventional studies in animals and humans have addressed the effects of KD on cognitive impairments, and the results were inconclusive. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of KD on cognitive functions and AD pathology in 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice—a validated animal model of AD.

1,methods0,"  2.1 Animals  5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) transgenic mice express 5 human familial Alzheimer's disease (familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)) mutants in amyloid‐beta precursor protein (amyloid‐beta precursor protein (APP)) and presenilin 1 (PS1) driven by the Thy1 promoter. 17 Experimental 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice were obtained by crossing heterozygous transgenic mice with C57BL/6 wild‐type breeders. Wild‐type littermates were used as controls and randomly allotted to each experiment. Male mice were used in all experiments. All mice were housed in a standard animal facility with a 12 h alternating light/dark cycle. All experiments in this study were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)), Chinese Academy of Sciences (Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)).  2.",adf45cb8-453c-4de2-b6e9-d3bf72bd0ae0
2,methods1,"2 Diets  Ketogenic diet formula (Patent NO.201210123235.0) was manufactured and supplied by Jintong Special Medical Food Co., Ltd (Guangzhou, China). It contained 76% fat, 16% protein, 3% carbohydrate, and 5% dietary fiber in kcal. The control diet was a standard laboratory chow diet from Beijing Keao Xieli Feed Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). It contained 12% fat, 23% protein, and 65% carbohydrate in kcal. Both the ketogenic diet and standard diet contained multiple vitamins and minerals. For the animals that were fed with a standard diet, the standard diet was available ad libitum. For the animals fed with a ketogenic diet, the ketogenic diet was provided at an amount that matched the calories to that of the standard diet consumed by wild‐type mice each day.  2.3 Barns maze  The protocol for the Barns maze was performed as previously described. 18 , 19 Briefly, the apparatus (Chengdu Techman Instrument Co., Ltd., ST‐120) was a revolvable white acrylic disc (0.75 m in diameter) 0.",a17df95b-f018-472e-96f0-2c21ca9cd575
3,methods2,"58 m elevated from the floor with 18 holes (5 cm diameter) equally spaced along the perimeter of the circle and positioned in a brightly light (600 lux). One hole was selected as the escape target hole, and a dark escape chamber was placed under the target hole consistent for each trial. Mice were allowed to freely explore on the platform for 5 min without the escape chamber, and habituated to the escape chamber for 2 min on two consecutive days. In the training phase, a session of 2 trials was performed by each mouse. Each mouse was covered under a nontransparent cylinder placed in the center of the maze. After 15 s, the cylinder was gently removed to allow mouse to explore the maze for 180 s until the target hole was found. If mice did not find the target hole, the latency was considered to be 180s. The maze and the escape chamber were wiped with 70% ethanol. The mouse was identified to find the target chamber when the back of the mice crossed the target hole.",b79adaf6-a807-457d-81e6-b97a71de0270
4,methods3," The mouse was considered to have entered the target chamber if the entire body was on the platform. The primary latency that mice took to find the target hole was documented for each trial. Two trials per day were performed for eight days. For the probe test, memory retention was assessed 5 days after the last training trial. The duration of the probe trial was 90 s. If the animal did not find the target hole within 90 s, the latency was considered as 90 s. The position of the target hole was the same as that in the training period. The primary latency to find the target hole and time in the target quadrant was analyzed by Anymaze software.  2.4 T Maze  T maze protocol was performed as previously described. 20 Briefly, before performing the task, the diet of mice was restricted daily to hold 80% to 85% of their primary body weight throughout the task. The T maze apparatus was placed in a quiet room, and light intensity was held at a constant level (100 lux).",96a9047f-adfe-4323-84f0-6c34569d2795
5,methods4," During the training, a forced choice was followed by a free choice for each trial. In the forced‐choice phase, a food pellet was placed in either the left or right choice arm. The door to the choice arm with food pellet was opened, while the other choice arm was closed. The mouse was allowed to consume the pellet. When the pellet was consumed, the mouse was returned to the start arm. After the forced choice was completed, the free choice was initialized. During the free choice, all doors were open; the mouse was allowed to freely enter one of two arms. If the mouse entered the same arm as in the forced‐choice phase, the trial was considered to result in an “error,” and the pellet was removed. If the mouse entered the opposite arm as in the forced‐choice phase, the trial was considered to have a “correct” result, and the mouse was rewarded with a food pellet. Following each session, the apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol. Six consecutive trials were performed in a session per day.",eda0d4c8-3384-4504-9b85-526f41547a2a
6,methods5," The percentage of correct responses was calculated in each session.  2.5 Open field test  Motor activity and anxiety were studied in the open field test. Briefly, mice were placed in a white Plexiglas box (40 × 40 × 40 cm) in the dark and were allowed to freely explore the arena. The mouse activity was monitored under an infrared camera for 5 min. The distance and time spent in the center zone and total distance were measured by Anymaze software. The box was cleaned with 70% ethanol thoroughly after each trial.  2.6 Immunofluorescence staining  Immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described. 21 , 22 Mice were perfused transcardially with PBS and then 4% paraformaldehyde (paraformaldehyde (PFA)) in 0.1 M PBS sequentially. The brains were extracted and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4°C, followed by dehydration in 15% and 30% sucrose until immersed at the bottom of the tube.

For staining, brain sections were washed with PBS three times followed by blocking with 10% normal goat serum containing 0.3% Triton X‐100 for 2 h at room temperature in PBS. Subsequently, sections were incubated in primary antibody diluted in blocking solution (5% normal goat serum containing 0.3% Triton X‐100 in PBS) at 4°C for 24–48 h. The sections were washed three times with PBS and then incubated in secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution (5% normal goat serum containing 0.3% Triton X‐100 in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. Cell nuclei were stained with 6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI). Afterward, sections were washed with PBS three times and mounted on slides. Fluorescent images were captured using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 800) or slide scanner (Olympus, VS120).",14918db2-d4f6-487e-b707-d038d54e1167

The concentrations of cytokines (IL‐1β and TNF‐α) were detected in duplicate with an Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Neobioscience) according to the product protocol. All samples were stored at −80°C before the Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiment. The protein concentration was determined with a microreader (BIOTEK Elx800).  2.8 Golgi staining  Golgi staining was performed as the manufacturer's instruction (FD, Neurotechnologies). Mice were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital, and the brains were collected on ice. The brains were immersed in Golgi Solution A and B mixture for 2 weeks at room temperature and then replaced with Golgi Solution C at 4°C for 3 days.

Images were obtained using a 100× oil immersion objective (Olympus BX53F2 upright fluorescence microscope). The spines in secondary dendritic branches (24 neurons in lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) from three mice) were calculated in Image J software. The density of spines was calculated by dividing the total number of spines to the length of dendritic branch (20 μm).  2.9 Statistical analysis  Data are expressed as the mean ±standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 8.0). The Shapiro‐Wilk test was used to test the normality.",4eec36a1-3008-42c5-899d-5879dad0f3e0
11,methods10," If the data were normally distributed, one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two‐way ANOVA was used to compared the differences between three independent samples, and the least significant difference test (least significant difference test (LSD)) was applied for post hoc multiple comparisons. Otherwise, nonparametric Kruskal‐Wallis tests were performed and followed by Dunn's post hoc tests. p Values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.  3 ",ce4cb220-d67e-411d-9a11-d86429defb15
12,results0," 3.1 Ketogenic diet ameliorates cognitive impairment in 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice  The overall experimental procedure is illustrated in Figure 1A. 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice started a ketogenic diet (KD) at the age of 7 months—when they already exhibited severe AD histopathology and cognitive decline. 23 The control 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice and wild‐type littermates were fed with a standard laboratory chow diet (standard diet, SD). Cognitive function was tested 4 months after KD, at the age of 11 months for all groups of mice (Figure 1A). We firstly assessed hippocampus‐dependent spatial learning and memory with the Barns maze, 24 , 25 a dry‐land version of the Morris water maze (Figure 1B). During the training phase, wild‐type mice fed with SD showed a progressive decrease in the latency to find the escape hole, indicating significant learning over 8 days of training (Figure 1C, black curve).",0fc219b5-1d6f-4bfb-8fee-40280443f72c
13,results1," The 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice fed with SD had a much longer latency and did not demonstrate this improvement, suggesting a severe deficit in the spatial learning task (Figure 1C, orange curve). In contrary, 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice fed with KD showed significant improvement in spatial learning (Figure 1C, cyan curve). A two‐way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Group X Training Day) on latency revealed a main effect of training day (time: F(7,225) = 5.9, p < 0.001; group: F(2,225) = 46.2, p < 0.001), and interaction (F(14,225) = 2.2, p < 0.001). On the final day (8th day) of training, 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice fed with KD had a much shorter latency (34.4 ± 11.6 s) than those fed with SD (109.9 ± 31.5 s) and was not different from wild‐type mice fed with SD (22.0 ± 6.0 s) (Figure 1C).

29,results17,"3) compared with wild‐type littermates (163.2 ± 14.3), consistent with the microgliosis pathology of AD. In contrast, KD treatment significantly reduced Iba‐1+ cells (189.1 ± 20.0) (Figure 4C,D).  Activated microglia undergoes morphological changes and engulfs synapses, 43 which is one of the mechanisms by which microglia mediate synapse loss during AD progression. We thus examined the morphology of microglia. The microglial cell body became larger (Figure 4E,F), and the primary process became shorter (Figure S2A) in 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice compared with wild‐type mice, indicating a switch toward a phagocytic state of microglia. 44 , 45 Strikingly, KD significantly decreased the microglial cell body diameter and increased the primary process length. These results indicate that KD attenuates microglial activation and alleviates microgliosis.  Neuroinflammation contributes to AD pathogenesis.",c4004bdf-66e1-4f33-a491-82b63c61eed5
30,results18," 46 To further examine whether KD reduces neuroinflammation, we examined the levels of the pro‐inflammatory cytokines interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β) and tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) in the hippocampal and neocortical tissue by Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IL‐1β and TNF‐α concentrations in both the hippocampus and neocortex were increased in 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice compared with wild‐type mice, suggesting excessive neuroinflammation in subjects with AD. However, this increase in IL‐1β and TNF‐α was reversed by KD treatment (Figure 4G–J). These results indicate that KD reduces the inflammation response in the brain.  3.5 The improvement effect of ketogenic diet on cognition depends on the time and duration of intervention  Our data, which showed that a 4‐month KD improved learning and memory in 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice, led us to determine whether a shorter period of KD would also have a similar beneficial effect.",3c3d0949-80a1-47b6-9351-3706fc03586d

Conclusions  These findings indicate positive effects of ketogenic diet on both cognitive function and histopathology in Alzheimer's disease, which could be due to reduced microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Our findings provide new insights and therapeutic interventions for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

37,results26," 1 , 2 As the average life expectancy increases, the number of AD cases is expected to reach 76 million by 2030. Despite its devastating consequences and tremendous economic cost, there is no effective treatment thus far. Thus, AD becomes one of the most severe global public health issues. 1  The key neuropathology of AD includes gross atrophy of the brain, deposition of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and extensive loss of neurons and synapses. 1 , 3 It is believed that the accumulation of Aβ is the primary factor that initiates multiple neurotoxic events and drives AD pathogenesis. 4 , 5 , 6 Around Aβ plaques, gliosis is characterized by the proliferation and activation of astrocytes and microglia that cause inflammatory responses and contribute to neuronal and synapse loss. The loss of neurons and synapses eventually causes memory loss and cognitive impairment. Thus, many efforts have been made to clear Aβ in the brain.",5f00f88e-82d4-43ed-9037-52cb1ab3f3c1
38,results27," 4 , 5 However, many clinical trials targeting Aβ have yielded disappointing results. 7 Recently, a therapy aiming at removing amyloid plaques by an Aβ‐directed antibody, aducanumab, has received accelerated approval as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Food and Drug Administration (FDA)). 8 However, aducanumab is not a perfect cure, and although it can effectively clear Aβ, evidence that it can restore lost memories or cognitive function in AD patients remains to be collected. 8 , 9  The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high‐fat, low‐carbohydrate diet that promotes the genesis of ketone bodies (mainly acetoacetate and β‐hydroxybutyrate) through fat metabolism in the liver. 10 KD has been clinically demonstrated to be effective in treating refractive epilepsy. 11 It has been proposed that KD alter the composition of the gut microbiota 12 , 13 and increase GABA levels which might mediate the anti‐seizure effect.",8b89f535-b24e-4e91-a1a6-5697733314e5
39,results28," 14 KD has also been reported to reduce neuroinflammation, 15 which has been proposed to be beneficial to other neurological diseases. Although there are considerable interests in the impact of KD on AD progression, few studies have addressed whether KD could improve cognitive functions and the underlying mechanism. 16  In this study, we subjected 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice to different periods of a ketogenic diet that was initiated at different stages of AD. We found that a 4‐month KD initiated at 7 months of age dramatically improved the cognitive ability of AD model mice. The improvement in cognitive ability was associated with a restored number of synapses and neurons, and a reduction in Aβ deposition and microgliosis. Inflammation in the brain was also decreased by KD consumption. These results suggest that KD improves cognitive function, possibly by reducing multiple neuropathologies associated with AD.  2 ",dbe6cf48-eaed-4cd9-90d1-a2b0400813b9
40,discussion0,"  Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia in elderly people. 1 Patients with AD experience progressive loss of memory and cognitive function, eventually leading to the disruption of daily life. 47 Currently available treatments for AD only slightly delay the progression of the disease and do not affect the main neuropathological features of the disease. 48 Numerous efforts have been made to develop drugs against AD pathogenesis, including Aβ, but the results were disappointing. 7  Our results in the present study demonstrated that 4 months of ketogenic diet improved cognitive functions in 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice. In addition to improvements in cognitive functions, synapse loss and neuronal loss were reversed. KD also attenuated Aβ deposition, decreased microgliosis, and reduced neuroinflammation.",e4951e6c-5019-4702-8301-8ad2afe29001
41,discussion1," These results suggest that KD is able to alleviate AD pathology and improve learning and memory, probably by protecting neurons and synapses through reducing neuroinflammation and neurotoxic Aβ accumulation. Considering its proven efficacy and safety in treating refractive epilepsy, 4 KD represents a very promising therapeutic intervention for managing Alzheimer's disease.  The exact link between KD and AD remains obscure. The ketogenic diet is a high‐fat, low‐carbohydrate diet that is able to promote ketogenesis. When glucose is not readily available, the brain's metabolism switches toward ketone bodies, which are generated through ketosis that break down fat in the liver. 31 There are several mechanisms that could potentially underlie the beneficial effect of KD on AD. First, abnormal glucose metabolism was observed in advance of the onset of cognitive decline in AD.",bcfc3c1b-17ab-4662-9f96-6b601dba73b6
42,discussion2," 49 PET imaging studies revealed that the utilization of glucose declines in AD brain but ketone body utilization does not. 50 Thus, KD might improve the cognition by providing an additional fuel supply to the brain. Second, apolipoprotein E (Apo‐E) is one of the most detrimental AD genetic risk factor. 51 , 52 The Apo‐E ε4 allele is associated with lower efficiency in lipid transport and increases AD risk. Thus, KD might alleviate AD symptoms by promoting lipid metabolism. Third, it has been shown that KD could alter gut microbiota. 14 The gut microbiota regulates host brain functions via the gut‐brain axis, which has been reported to play an important role in AD pathogenesis. 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 Thus, KD might ameliorate AD pathology by regulating gut microbiota and reducing neuroinflammation. 44 , 57 In the future, it would be very interesting to examine the precise underlying mechanism of KD on the cognitive functions.",cdb90adf-2eb2-4673-a3a4-0fb5391643ef
43,discussion3,"  In 5Xfamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mice, amyloid plaque is detected at the age of 2 months, synapse loss and cognitive impairments are observed at 6 months, and extensive neuronal loss occurs at 1 year. Our results show that 4‐month KD initiated at 7 months dramatically improves cognitive functions and alleviates AD pathology. This suggests that KD intervention upon the diagnosis of AD could display strong therapeutic effects. However, KD initiated at later stage of 9 months of age exhibits no beneficial effect, suggesting earlier intervention achieves better beneficial effect. Shorter intervention shows some detectable improvement, although it is weaker than longer intervention. Conceivably, it is very important to determine a proper KD protocol in AD patients to achieve the best effect on cognition.  CONFLICT OF INTEREST  None.
