0,methods0," Every patient born at the Soroka Medical Center between 2016 and 2020 and diagnosed with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD)-E3 due to homozygosity of the D479V pathogenic variant in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) gene (NM_000108.5) was offered a KD as detailed below.  We compared dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) patients born between 2016 and 2020 to a historical cohort of patients born between 2000 and 2016, focusing on data regarding the survival and quality of life, by measurements of development as well as imaging studies.  The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the Institutional Review Board (Institutional Review Board (IRB)) of the Soroka Medical Center (approval number SOR-0159-19). The need for individual written informed consent was waived as the study was based on questionnaires filled out by the attending physicians, and the paper does not contain identifiable personal details nor patient photos.",8248b6dd-b7a6-4230-a1f1-4226f921a722
1,methods1,"  2.1. Dietary Intervention  2.1.1. Partial Ketogenic Diet  The patients on a partial KD received KetoCal (Nutricia, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), a high-fat content formula (based on 4:1 ketogenic ratio) combined with a based milk standard infant formula, as part of their diet, with 60–70% of the total energy coming from fat. Protein was provided to meet infant dietary reference intake and above (2.5–3.5 g/kg) according to their nutritional needs. (Dietary details presented in Table 1).  2.1.2. Parenteral Nutrition  All patients (regardless of KD) received lipofundin (B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) or SMOFlipid emulsion (Fresenius Kabi AB, Uppsala, Sweden) of up to 4 g/kg/day during a crisis as a supply of energy, and essential fatty acids and omega-3 fatty acids, as part of a parenteral nutrition regimen when oral or enteral nutrition was impossible, insufficient or contra-indicated. At the same time, hepatic enzymes were monitored.  2.2.",a3121626-bc62-4b80-af42-5d9839d51d5f
2,methods2," Imaging Studies  Brain magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) was performed as a clinical study in all treated by KD cases. Standard clinical protocols were used including T1, T2, and T1 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted imaging. All images were reviewed by a pediatric neuroradiologist.  2.3. Biochemical Studies  Biochemical tests, including serum liver transaminases, serum lactate levels and venous blood gases, were periodically obtained as part of the clinical investigations, and performed by the Clinical Laboratory of the Soroka Medical Center.  3. Results  During the study period, eight patients were diagnosed as homozygous to D479V in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) gene, and four of them were treated with a ketogenic diet, and prescribed with additional sodium bicarbonate as needed.",898f853a-6614-45e4-b3f1-257f1909b722
3,methods3," All patients treated with a partial KD underwent the insertion of a percutaneous gastrostomy (percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG)), and one had a Nissen funduplication procedure. Patients treated with a partial ketogenic diet were fed orally or by percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) according to their choice. The other four were only treated with sodium bicarbonate, according to their parents’ decisions.  The historical cohort included eight patients diagnosed as homozygous to D479V in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) gene born between 2000–2016. Of the eight patients in the historical cohort, only two (25%) survived beyond 3.5 years with a weight of less than 10 kg (patients 9,10, Table 2), and all were severely encephalopathic and did not reach any developmental milestones (Table 3).",4aa9ce26-ae59-4a16-8533-134c4b70a72b
4,methods4,"  None of the patients who received a less restrictive partial KD had a worsened condition with the treatment; however, all patients had severe developmental delays (Table 3), with recurrent hospital admissions due to metabolic crises with different triggers, such as intercurrent infections. None of the patients started walking independently nor with assistance. None of the patients started talking, other than babbling.  Of note, while all patients were homozygous to the same mutation, their presentations were somewhat variable with regard to the severity of the disease and the age of death (Table 2 and Table 3). Nevertheless, while several patients died early and others survived, all patients in our cohort showed a very severe phenotype, as opposed to, for instance, previously reported patients harboring the G229C variant (Supplementary Table S1), further supporting the genotype–phenotype correlations in this disorder.",cd6d6b91-0507-4ecb-8482-dfc25d05fc16
5,methods5,"  Only three patients (19%) of the whole cohort did not have any episodes of hypoglycemia, and the others had recurrent episodes during the metabolic crises. Only four patients (25%) had liver disease with elevated transaminases during metabolic crises (Table 3).  Four patients had urine organic profiles that all revealed elevated 2-OH-Butyrate and 3-OH-Butyrate > Acetoacetate (Table 4).  Six patients underwent brain imaging by magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) (patients 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 16; of these, patients 11 and 13 were on regular diet) which revealed the partial agenesis of corpus callosum with a restriction of the dentate nucleus, moderate ventriculomegaly, the restriction of globus pallidum and of the midbrain (Figure 1), with no difference between those on PD to those on a regular diet (Table 5).  4. Discussion  dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD)-E3 is a rare disorder with a variable spectrum of presentation and course of disease.",4b7dfd42-95b1-4e92-8e2f-09a2d5ac623f
6,methods6," We present a cohort homozygous to the same severe mutation with a devastating disease. Currently, there is neither a definitive treatment, nor consensus management guidelines for patients with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD)-E3 deficiency.  All the patients in our cohort were homozygous to the p.D479V (or p.D444V) [8] mutation in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) gene. So far, there is only one previous report of a patient homozygous to this mutation in the literature [9]. Additionally, so far only a few dozen [36] patients with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD)-E3 are reported worldwide (their clinical and molecular characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table S1), and we add here a cohort of an additional 16 patients.  Shany et al.",9ae59eff-13bf-4a85-bb47-2e1446f7ae19
7,methods7," compared the current mutation to the G229C mutation, which was reported in recurrent episodic liver failure, and found that, although the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD)-E3 residual activity in the muscle homogenate was higher in the current mutation than in G229C, the multi-enzymatic complex activity in the current mutation was undetectable compared to the G229C with a higher residual activity. This most likely resulted from the location of the discussed mutation in the interface domain which led to the impaired stabilization of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) complex, which was more important than the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD)-E3 for the activity, and therefore led to severe neurodegenerative disease [9].  Ambrus et al.",a0f752fa-e732-47c2-9895-d972d11137b1
8,methods8," found that the selected pathogenic variants of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD)-E3, including the D444V, produced elevated amounts of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) that led to mitochondrial oxidative stress, resulting in brain damage. In addition, certain pathogenic variants will also lose their affinity for the E2 component of the PDHc, whilst a comparison with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) showed only a significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation in vitro [37]. The above described process oxidatively damaged the LA-cofactors KGDHc and PDHc, in the case of D444V, in human homozygous fibroblasts [38]. These could partially explain why KD that was built on lipids did not yield an improvement as expected in patients with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD)-E3 mutations.  Most of our patients in the past had a severe fatal course of the disease with early death, within 3 months in four patients of the historical cohort.",72f5ac33-fa31-49b4-b78a-838c6cd7115f
9,methods9," The patients who were treated with a less restrictive partial KD in our study, also presented similar to these patients at birth, at least one of them presented two hours after birth with seizures due to hypoglycemia and acidosis; however, they did not succumb and survived the perinatal crisis, most likely due to close monitoring and mainly with the addition of fats in the diet and the frequent treatment with sodium bicarbonate. The addition of fats in the forms of lipofundin (B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) or SMOFlipid emulsion (Fresenius Kabi AB, Uppsala, Sweden) up to 4 g/kg/day changed the disease progression during the crisis in these severely affected patients, with a significant improvement following the introduction or increment of the fat amount.  Additionally, in recent years the close monitoring of these patients with an improved supportive therapy also added to the embellished survival rate, although the quality of life did not significantly improve.",6ac3bdd7-851f-4a2d-aad1-ef02b5a98f92
10,methods10," In this study we found that even if a patient achieves delayed milestones and says a few words, with time they unfortunately deteriorate to chronic encephalopathy, as can be seen in the description of patients (pt.7) (Table 2).  As can be noted in Table 4, the lactate–pyruvate ratio in eight patients was >20 which could be observed, either by taking after feeds, by improved control or even as an unreliable measure. No correlation to the diet was noted.  Brain imaging studies demonstrated that, even with the strict management and partial PD, patients 8, 11, and 13 all showed the severe changes consistent with Leigh disease. Additionally, when comparing these exams to brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)s of patients 12 and 14, who were on regular diets due to their parents’ preferences, no significant differences were seen.",1ff80e08-6a4c-4fe7-930a-620804cc4966
11,methods11,"  One of the major issues to consider was the safety of treatment and, although the sample is small, none of our patients deteriorated under this regimen, nor developed any adverse events. Our findings were supported by a few studies indicating that the KD was an efficient and safe treatment during childhood. Its adverse effects, although common, were very mild [39,40,41]. Furthermore, more palatable but related diets, such as the modified Atkins diet (modified Atkins diet (MAD)) or the less restrictive KD, like the one evaluated in our study, were associated with fewer adverse effects [42,43,44]. However, these should be implemented under careful medical supervision.  The strength of our study is a cohort of 16 patients all homozygous to the same mutation of a rare disease, with only about twice as many [36] such patients reported in the literature to date.",274bb27d-be3a-4e11-99b9-c338bcb0d3b3
12,methods12," A limitation of the study is the lack of formal cognitive tests, although, due to the severity of the phenotype, these could not be performed.  As mentioned above, the administration of a less restrictive partial KD prolongs life; however, the quality of life does not seem to significantly improve, and even if there is a partial gaining of milestones, the patients eventually lose their acquired abilities. Thus, it is probable that the prenatal damage is so significant that, even with close monitoring and a specific diet, we cannot currently overcome it.  5. Conclusions  Our results show that while the treatment of patients with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD)-E3 deficiency with a partial KD improves survival (Table 2), the quality of life is not improved. Thus, we need to consider whether a stricter diet might have an improved quality of life.",f400ae66-b5ab-450e-bdec-10b57075490d
13,methods13," Another important consideration should be whether, with such a difficult regimen and no supportive results, this treatment should be offered to families. Additionally, we should consider future therapeutic measures such as vitamin supplementation, for example riboflavin as previously recommended [14], the supplementation of triheptanoin, or a targeted gene therapy.
