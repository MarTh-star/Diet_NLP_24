0,methods0," 4.1. Ketogenic Cell Model  All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich Inc, St. Louis, MO, USA) via the local distributor in Taiwan unless otherwise specified. To elucidate how ketogenic condition may affect cellular 1C metabolism, a stable cell-line established from the human hepatoma cell-line HepG2 that expresses human glycine N-methyltransferase (glycine N methyltransferase (GNMT)) [49] was used as a liver-derived cell model, as it is more relevant to normal hepatocyte metabolism compared to wild-type HepG2 cells and we have thoroughly characterized 1C metabolic kinetics [49] and it would be a better cell model for investigating hepatic metabolism compared to wild-type HepG2 cells [50].",1ba1ff56-349c-453b-a22b-aa4f25970ddb
1,methods1,"  Cells were cultured in α Minimum Essential Medium α (αminimum essential medium (MEM)) with 10% fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum (FBS)), 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin–Amphotericin B Solution (Penicillin–Streptomycin–Amphotericin B Solution (PSA)), at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The ketogenic treatment was conducted as previously described [51]. In brief, 3 × 105 cells were seeded in a 60 mm dish with α-minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After seeding overnight, the medium was changed to one containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM or 10 mM DL-βHB sodium. Metabolic studies using isotopic tracers were conducted as described below.  4.2.",d253a4be-8d0a-4e44-9f6c-8883f41bf8b6
2,methods2," In Vitro Isotopic Tracer Studies  To investigate the utilization of carbon C2-carbon of glycine, cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (minimum essential medium (MEM)), supplemented with vitamin B12 alone with non-essential amino acid (non essential amino acid (NEAA)), lipoic acid, pyruvate, ascorbate, serine (0.238 mM), and [2-13C]-Glycine (0.667 mM)(Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA, USA) [11]. The final media composition was comparable to that of the standard αminimum essential medium (MEM) [11]. In the labeling experiments, isotopic enrichments from the tracers are calculated as molar ratios of labeled to non-labeled isotopomers after correction for the natural abundance of stable isotopes. The M + 1 is the isomer of the metabolite that contains 1 extra mass unit, and the M + 2 is the isomer of the metabolite that contains two extra mass units. The glycine cleavage system (GCS)-derived 1C moiety is exported from the mitochondria as formate.",031313ee-c2f7-4325-ac86-1e09ed32d64f
3,methods3," As glycine is decarboxylated and catabolized via the glycine cleavage system (GCS) in the mitochondria, the original 13C-labeled glycine 2-carbon is transferred to THF to yield 13C-labeled methyleneTHF, which ultimately produces 13C-labeled formate. Theoretically, this 1C unit can be utilized in cytosolic biosynthesis for nucleotides, serine, methionine, etc. [11]. After the labeling period, cells were collected, extracted [52], and derivatized for further analyses as previously described [53,54].  All experiments were performed in duplicates independently at least two times, and data from one experiment are presented. Isotopic enrichments in Ser + 2 and dTMP + 1 from [2-13C]glycine reflected the utilization of mitochondrial glycine cleavage system (GCS) derived formate in cytosol serine and dTMP synthesis [11].  4.3. Ketogenic Animal Model in Mice  The animal protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Chung Hsing University.",685abf8b-9dd3-4627-9a0e-c7867ae97dbe
4,methods4," Twenty male 7 weeks old C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Center (NLAC, Taipei, Taiwan). After 1 week of habituation, mice were divided into two groups and fed with either a control diet (control diet (CTL)) or a medium-chain enriched triglyceride ketogenic diet (MCT-KD) for 8 weeks (8 vs. 12). Mice were raised under specific pathogen-free conditions at 20–25 °C. The lighting was operated on a 12 h light-dark cycle. All mice had access to sterilized water ad libitum. Control mice were provided an AIN-93M diet (Dyets, Bethlehem, PA, USA). MCT-KD mice were provided with a homemade Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) enriched ketogenic diet. The 2 pie charts in Figure 2A present the macronutrient compositions (Figure 5A), and the detailed components of the control diet and MCT-KD are shown in Table 8.",541012a0-b0fc-415f-b70f-b63a0516d6ae
5,methods5,"  We chose Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) instead of long chain fatty acids (LCFA) as our main fat source to avoid obesity, insulin resistance, or metabolic syndrome, and also for potential beneficial effects of MCT [26,27,28,29].  As for protein content, it has been proposed that protein level may have a major influence on mTORC1 signal in response to a KD [55], but further research is needed to understand better whether protein level is essential for ketogenesis and its related health benefits. We designed the MCT-KD with non-calorie from carbohydrate, as a previous study in mice fed a KD composed of 95% calories from fat without carbohydrate induced a steady 15% weight loss compared to controls consumed an isocaloric control diet [1,30]. We also made our diet with 14% calories from protein for the following reasons. The induction of ketosis in rodents was suggested to be dependent on the high-fat content in combination with low protein content [32].",5018dc0b-e06a-4960-9505-5da8c0f35ae1
6,methods6," However, whether low protein content is also essential for weight and fat loss is unknown. A previous study in mice fed a carbohydrate-free, normal/high protein ketogenic diet (80% of calories from lard and butter and 20% from protein) significantly increased the fat mass [31]. Therefore, we also aimed to examine whether KD diets with normal protein content can still successfully induce a ketogenic state and effectively result in weight and fat loss. The normal protein content in our MCT-KD also enabled us to examine whether the metabolic advantages induced by KD consumption are associated with methionine restriction. It has been proposed that choline and methionine restriction, rather than carbohydrate restriction, underlies many of the metabolic effects of KD [1,30]. With normal protein and choline contents in our MCT-KD, we successfully induced weight and fat loss.",80e2cb14-3c0b-4e31-af5c-b8cb64044b46
7,methods7," Finally, with normal dietary protein/amino acid contents, mice tissues could be successfully labeled with detectable enrichments in vivo using our labeling approaches.  Body weight was measured daily, and food intake was calculated weekly during the entire study. The feeding efficiency was calculated as the total body mass gain divided by the total kcal for each individual animal over the duration of the study. The mean body weight of MCT-KD-fed mice became significantly lower 30 days after the initiation of the diet intervention.  Ketone measurements were performed 4 weeks after the dietary intervention to check if mice reached a ketogenic state. After fasting for four hours, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and the plasma was collected into a heparin coating tube through the orbital vein. The content of β-hydroxybutyrate in mouse plasma was determined by a β-Hydroxybutyrate Colorimetric Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).  4.4.",60c47095-06eb-48b1-86b5-a468a54767c9
8,methods8," In Vivo Metabolic Tracer Studies  In vivo labeling studies were conducted to trace the metabolic fate of glycine 2-carbon and the partitioning of serine 3-carbon before the termination of the study. During this period, mice were fed a modified L-amino acid defined diet with the same amino acid composition as either the AIN-93M diet or the MCT-KD except for the substitution of designated tracer: [2-13C]glycine (for 144 h), or L-[2,3,3-2H3]serine (for 72 h) as described previously [11] (Figure 5B). The labeling diets were divided into small parts that were provided every 4 h during the labeling periods to ensure the tracers were slowly and evenly consumed during the labeling period [11].  In L-[2,3,3-2H3]serine experiments, methyleneTHF supplied by cSHMT and incorporated directly into methionine or dTMP retains the two deuterium atoms (CD2) on the hydroxymethyl group of serine.",cf78f5d7-4173-4941-9656-ae7ec81d6c27
9,methods9," If the L-[2,3,3-2H3]serine enters the mitochondria and the hydroxymethyl group is released from the mitochondria as formate, it only contains a single deuterium atom (CD1) [56,57]. L-[2,3,3-2H3]serine was also used to trace folate-dependent homocysteine remethylation as described previously [24]. Folate-dependent homocysteine remethylation (Folate dependent homocysteine remethylation (FDR)) was calculated as the relative enrichments in methionine from L-[2,3,3-2H3]serine [58].  Mice were sacrificed by isoflurane and cardiac puncture at the end of the labeling period after overnight fasting for 12 h. Blood was collected in heparin-coated tubes; the erythrocytes and plasma were separated immediately by 500× g centrifugation at 4 °C. Liver tissues were immediately excited upon sacrifice. Bone marrow cells were collected and washed by PBS. All tissues were stored at −80 °C until analysis as described [59].  4.5.",e56e5991-caf9-4325-a6aa-7865c0f9f462
10,methods10," Determination of Formate Concentrations and Enrichments from Glycine and Serine  Plasma formate concentrations were determined as previously described [60]. The isotopic enrichments in formate from [2-13C]glycine and L-[2,3,3-2H3]serine were calculated as molar ratios of labeled to non-labeled isotopomers after correction for the natural abundance of formate.  4.6. Determination of Amino Acid Concentrations and Enrichments from Glycine and Serine  Plasma and cytosolic free amino acids from cells or tissue samples were extracted using 0.4 M ice-cold perchloric acid (perchloric acid (PCA)) [59,61]. Cellular proteins were hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl under a vacuum. The amino acids were purified by cation-exchange chromatography, converted to heptafluorobutyryl-propyl ester derivatives, and separated on an HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 nm).",f2db6171-b217-49e6-9bc7-0470d20735b4
11,methods11," Isotopic enrichment was determined in electron capture negative ionization mode by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using a model 6890 GC and model 5975C MS (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA), as described previously [54,62].  4.7. Determination of Nucleotide Enrichments from Glycine and Serine  Genomic DNA was isolated and purified, as described previously [53]. The DNA samples were dried and hydrolyzed in formic acid under vacuum, then derivatized by N, O- Bis- [trimethylsilyl] trifluoroacetamide 1% trimethyl-chlorosilane and acetonitrile. Isotopic enrichments in deoxyadenylate (dAMP, dA), deoxyguanylate (dGMP, dG), deoxythymidine (dTMP, dT were determined in positive ionization mode by GC/MS, as described previously [53].  4.8. Statistical Analysis  Comparisons of the means between the control and the treatment groups were determined using the Student’s t-test. Results are expressed as mean ± SD. All statistical analyses were performed with SYSTAT 11.",7e883223-8abf-4b0b-8ce2-86f50f8089c9

A trend of difference with a p-value < 0.1 is also reported.  5. Conclusions  In summary, we suggest that MCT-KD may not only reduce one-carbon metabolism through the mTOR pathway but also affect the supply of one-carbon metabolism in the mitochondria and even damage mitochondria.  Increased NAD during ketolytic metabolism may be a primary mechanism behind the beneficial effects of this metabolic therapy in a variety of brain disorders and in promoting health and longevity. However, there is a lot of evidence that the ketogenic diet has many health benefits, such as prevention of disease progression [63] and improvement in cognitive function [64]. Its impacts on 1C have not been investigated.",fa869b13-8e4a-4b94-adb5-0bd7d8ac7487
13,methods13," We demonstrate for the first time that a ketogenic diet may suppress glycine cleavage system (GCS) and mitochondria 1C fluxes and re-direct the utilization and the partitioning of 1C metabolic fluxes in vivo. With the wide application and minimal restrictions on its implementation worldwide, people and medical professionals should be more aware of and be cautious of the potential metabolic perturbations when practicing a long-term ketogenic diet in humans. More metabolic studies on the ketogenic diet are warranted.

The % change of the isotopic enrichments in each target compound was calculated by comparing them to the control group. The % change is presented when values are statistically significant (bold) or with a trend (p < 0.1) of difference from controls (italic). 3 Putative isotopic enrichment of serine + 3: [2,3,3-2H3]serine (Ser + 3) is labeled with one deuterium atom at the C-2 and another two at C-3 position. The synthesis of 5,10-CH2THF acquires the methylene group (-CH2-) from serine, generating glycine. The deuterium atom in 5,10-CD2THF from cytosol via cSHMT and that from mitochondria-derived formate (cSHMT and that from mitochondria derived formate (CDOOH)). In the reverse reaction, [2,3,3-2H3]serine can be synthesized from [2-2H1] glycine with the incorporation of the labeled methylene group of 5,10-CD2THF from cytosol.",7c6915fe-2d53-4693-97ed-75cee7beee55
