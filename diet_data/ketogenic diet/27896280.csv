0,introduction0,"Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) are involved in diverse cellular processes such as gene expression, signal transduction, and intracellular interactions. Lysine methylation in histones has been extensively studied for more than a decade; it is known to play important roles in gene expression, replication, and genome stability1–3. Although hundreds of non-histone lysine methylation sites have been reported, the enzymes responsible for methylation of these lysines and the physiological functions of these PTMs remain largely unknown.  There are approximately 40 MTase genes that may participate in mitochondrial functioning because the encoded proteins contain mitochondria-targeting signal sequences4. Nonetheless, only a small number of these genes has been characterised so far. METTL20 was the first mitochondrial lysine MTase (KMT) to be discovered (by two independent groups)5,6.",14a9dea5-3dc1-47c8-9037-c220c13d5697
1,introduction1," METTL20 specifically methylates the β subunit (electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B) of electron transfer flavoprotein (electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)), which acts as a mobile carrier of electrons from several flavin adenine dinucleotide–containing dehydrogenases to electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF): quinone oxidoreductase. The two METTL20 methylation sites in electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B, i.e. K200 and K203, are located in the proximity of the recognition loop responsible for the interaction between electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase (medium chain acyl coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase (MCAD))7; it is believed to be involved in interactions with other electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)-dependent dehydrogenases.",55e39dc8-6b0b-4c11-b223-03893bf2b17e
2,introduction2," Accordingly, it has been shown that METTL20 decreases the ability of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) to extract electrons from medium chain acyl coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase (MCAD) and glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase in vitro6. Moreover, METTL20-mediated methylation of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B influences the oxygen consumption rate in permeabilised mitochondria that are supplied with palmitoyl-L-carnitine5, suggesting that METTL20-mediated electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B methylation may play a regulatory role in mitochondrial metabolism.  Several approaches have been developed to probe lysine-methylated proteins specifically. One such approach involves antibodies specific to methylated lysine8,9. The second approach takes advantage of methylated lysine-binding domains. It has been reported that an engineered version of the triple malignant-brain-tumour domain region, i.e.",e4e0195c-677c-4a40-bde3-09d795c7db16
3,introduction3," L3MBTL1, can serve as a probe for the detection and enrichment of proteins containing mono- and di-methylated lysine residue(s)10,11. Another approach is to use cofactor analogues for labelling, detection, and pull-down via copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition, also known as click chemistry, to enrich PTM targets. Synthetic co-factors for lysine methylation of several SET domain KMTs have been reported, for example, SUV39H212, G9a/GLP12,13, ESET14, Set7/913, and a seven-β-strand MTase, METTL1015.  In the present study, we performed a proteomic substrate screening for METTL20 in mitochondria of cultured cells. We found that electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B is a major substrate; this result is consistent with other findings5,6. To explore the biological function of METTL20-mediated electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B methylation, we created Mettl20 knockout (KO) mice and characterised phenotypes related to their metabolism.

31,results4," Because histones contain many methylated lysine residues, we also tested recombinant histone H3 (hereafter: H3) in an experiment and demonstrated that METTL20 can methylate both electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B and H3 in vitro. It should be noted that because histones are nuclear proteins, they are possibly not a physiological target of METTL20, which is localised to mitochondria. Nevertheless, it is still possible that METTL20 has one or more additional mitochondrial substrates aside from electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B. We also confirmed that the methylation site in electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B is exactly the same as in other reports, i.e., K200 and K203 (Supplementary Fig. S2c–f)5,6.

Given that the methylation of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B inhibits the catalytic activity5,6, we also checked the mouse electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) catalytic activity in vitro. The recombinant electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) complex was incubated with METTL20, with or without AdoMet for 3 h, after which the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) complex was mixed with recombinant medium chain acyl coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase (MCAD), octanoyl-CoA, and 2,6-Dichloroindophenol (Dichloroindophenol (DCPIP)) as described previously16,17.

These results confirmed that methylation of lysine in electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B by METTL20 inhibits mouse electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) catalytic activity, in line with the results from other reports5,6,18.  Creation of Mettl20 KO mice by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing To understand the physiological function of METTL20 in vivo, Mettl20 KO mice were generated via the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology19,20.

As shown in Fig. 2c, mMETTL20 protein expression levels were undetectable in all the tissues tested in KO mice but were the highest in the WT liver. Because proteins METTL20 and electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B were highly expressed in the mouse liver, which is an important organ for fatty acid metabolism, we checked the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B methylation level in the liver of WT and KO mice. electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B in the liver was immunoprecipitated with an anti-electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B antibody, and methylation was detected with an anti-di-methyl lysine antibody (diMeLys) or anti-tri-methyl lysine antibody (triMeLys, Fig. 2d).",857d9704-8087-4dca-a158-048a88ea1223
35,results8," Tri-methylation of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B was not detected in KO mice, suggesting that mMETTL20 was crucial for the tri-methylation. Of note, di-methylation of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) was detected in neither WT nor KO mice. To verify this result, the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B immunoprecipitated from WT and Mettl20 KO liver samples was subjected to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). As shown in Fig. 2e, the K200 and K203-containing electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) peptide had an additional molecular weight (MW) of 28 Da in WT mice, in agreement with the MW observed after 2× trimethylation. In contrast, this additional MW was completely lost in KO mice. These observations implied that K200 and K203 were fully tri-methylated in electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B of WT mice but remained completely unmethylated in Mettl20 KO mice.Figure 2 Generation of Mettl20 knockout mouse.

As presented in Fig. 3a, the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) activity in Mettl20 KO mouse mitochondria was ~1.5-fold greater than that in the WT.

To examine the possibility that Mettl20 KO mice were better at generating energy from fat, a calorimetric analysis was performed on the mice fed the ND or KD, because the KO mice showed increased electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) activity (Fig. 3a).

45,results18," To further address the biological significance of genetic variants of METTL20 in the human population, we searched for genomic mutations within the exons of METTL20 in the ExAC Browser, which stores exome DNA sequence data for 60,706 individuals with diverse ancestries22.

In addition to the frameshift mutation that was reported in the Icelandic population21, individuals exist that are homozygous for certain missense mutations in METTL20 (ref.22 and Supplementary Table S1). Among them, the c.562G > A mutation (rs143179970) induces the D188N substitution in Motif Post II of the METTL20 MTase domain (Fig. 5b), which is crucial for the catalytic activity of seven-β-strand MTases such as VCPKMT23.",c574ffa4-5927-4323-b36b-9bd3747cc8c1

48,discussion0,"Approximately 40 MTase genes may participate in mitochondrial functions4; however, only a few of these ‘mitochondrial’ MTase genes have been characterised so far. METTL20 has been identified as an electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B MTase5,6. We also identified electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B as a METTL20 substrate by a unique method that involves the synthetic co-factor ProSeAM12,15. During the screening, electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B was found to be the sole candidate for METTL20 (Fig. 1c), suggesting that electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B is a major target of METTL20 in mitochondrial lysates. In the in vitro experiments, METTL20 methylated electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B at K200 and K203, and we could detect peptides carrying up to five methyl groups, but not fully methylated ones (Supplementary Fig. S2f). This observation is interesting because electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B is fully methylated in the mouse liver (Fig. 2d,e).",d07e6808-55d6-4644-9431-a8bebce86c97
49,discussion1," It is possible that other proteins or co-factors are required for full methylation of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B in vivo.  Given that methylation sites are located around the recognition loop, which is required for the interaction with medium chain acyl coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase (MCAD), it is probable that methylation of mouse electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B affects its catalytic activity (Fig. 1f), and this notion is consistent with the results from other reports5,6. In this study, we generated Mettl20 KO mice (Fig. 2) and demonstrated that methylation of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) was lost in KO mice. The catalytic activity of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) was higher in KO mice (Fig. 3a), suggesting that mMETTL20 has a regulatory role in fatty acid oxidation. Accordingly, Mettl20 KO mice also had a higher oxygen consumption rate and heat production when they consumed the KD (Fig. 3b and c).",927a2286-f8c5-4cac-a737-3e354dde6fdb
50,discussion2," Furthermore, the KO mice showed greater cold tolerance than the WT did during fasting although there was no difference during ad libitum feeding, where glucose metabolism is known to be a primary energy source (Fig. 3d and e). From these results, we can conclude that β-oxidation activity is regulated by the methylation of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B by METTL20, when fatty acids serve as a primary energy source, i.e. β-oxidation is highly activated. It should be noted that serum fatty acid concentrations were not affected by the Mettl20 KO (Fig. 4), pointing to the existence of a compensatory mechanism ensuring lipid homeostasis. Further research is needed to reveal such a compensatory mechanism.  The fact that Mettl20 KO mice grew to be normal and undistinguishable from WT mice (data not shown) implies that this gene is not essential. To test whether this is true for humans, the ExAC database was searched for genomic variations in Mettl20 exons.",ca6154b2-b914-4cf0-923e-7671d067e3de
51,discussion3," The analysis revealed that METTL20 is classified as a gene tolerant to LoF (Fig. 5a). The identified homozygous missense mutation (D118N) completely eliminated the METTL20 catalytic activity (Fig. 5c). These results further indicate that METTL20-mediated protein methylation is not essential in humans but more likely modulates energy production during fasting or under other metabolic conditions where β-oxidation is up-regulated. One possible benefit of this regulation is that too much energy production during fasting is avoided. This mechanism may help animals survive long-term starvation. Besides, it is likely that methylation of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF)B dynamically changes according to the metabolic environment, which, in turn, regulates metabolism adaptability. In both cases, further experiments are needed to test these possibilities.  ",eeb25929-972e-467f-8271-86814ffaa4f8
