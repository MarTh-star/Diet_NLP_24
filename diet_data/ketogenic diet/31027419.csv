0,methods0,"4.1. Animal Study All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taipei Medical University (LAC-2019-0186, May 2019 approved). Seven- to eight-week-old male NOD/SCID mice were purchased from the Taiwan National Laboratory Animal Center and used for xenograft study. For in vivo tumorigenesis assays, 5 × 106 Hep3B (parental, shlacZ and shHMGCS2) and Huh-7 (parental, eGFP, and HMGCS2) cells were subcutaneously injected into NOD/SCID mice (5–7 mice for each group). All mice were maintained on a standard chow diet (no. 5001, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO, USA) or a ketogenic diet (5TJQ, TestDiet, Richmond, IN, USA). Tumor size was measured three times a week with a Vernier caliper, and tumor volume was determined with the formula TV = (L × W2)/2, where L is the length and W is the width of the tumors. Tumor weight was measured using an electronic balance. This study is compliant with all relevant ethical regulations regarding animal research.",1844e600-d286-41ba-91fb-555074d866af

10,methods10," Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.  5. Conclusions Our study used cellular experiments and animal models to demonstrate that the downregulation of HMGCS2 attenuates the protective effect of the ketogenic diet, which is a shift from ketogenesis to enhancing the de novo lipogenesis pathways in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Taken together, our data suggest that HMGCS2 is an important factor that needs to be considered before using a ketogenic diet as a therapeutic approach for patients with Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Figure 7 HMGCS2 downregulation increased de novo lipogenesis, which reversed the antitumor effect of a KD. In Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors with HMGCS2 expression (left panel), KD supplementation increases ketogenesis mediated by HMGCS2, and therefore, inhibits Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor growth. In the absence of HMGCS2 (right panel), the Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors will be under the condition of ketogenic insufficiency. Under this circumstance, the use of a KD will increase de novo lipogenesis and ultimately trigger Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor growth. =",135cdbe6-3946-4093-9b72-c37547fc6f56
