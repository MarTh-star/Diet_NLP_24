0,methods0,"Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections from 22 brain biopsies (17 glioblastomas (GBM), 3 anaplastic astrocytoma and 2 anaplastic oligoastrocytoma) using antibodies raised against glycolytic and ketolytic enzymes. The glycolytic enzymes included hexokinase-II (HK2) and pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2). The ketone body metabolic enzymes included: succinyl CoA: 3-oxoacid CoA transferase (OXCT1), 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (BDH1 and BDH2), and acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1). The immunoreactivities were graded using a semi-quantitative scale based on the percentage of positive cells: positive (POS) (>20%), LOW (5-20%), and very low (very low (VLOW)) (<5%). Focal non-neoplastic “normal” brain tissue within the biopsy specimens served as internal controls.",233cc465-2278-4d8b-8765-1ab4de93c299
1,methods1,"  Immunohistochemistry reactions were performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections from brain biopsies, using antibodies raised against several glycolytic and ketolytic enzymes.  Glycolytic enzymes Hexokinase-II (HK2): Hexokinases catalyze the essentially irreversible first step of the glycolytic pathway where glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate via phosphate transfer from ATP. Hexokinase-II (HK2) is bound to the outer membrane of mitochondria and constitutes the principal isoform in many cell types, and is increased in many cancers [10,11].  Pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), an alternatively spliced variant of pyruvate kinase, is a cytosolic glycolytic enzyme that catalyses the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, and has been shown to be essential for aerobic glycolysis in many tumors [12].",7a57e97f-8ef0-4569-9bb1-6a29dc3380d7
2,methods2,"  Ketone body metabolic enzymes Succinyl CoA: 3-oxoacid CoA transferase 1 (OXCT1), encoded by the OXCT1 gene in human, is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of coenzyme A from succinyl-coenzyme A to acetoacetate, forming acetoacetyl-CoA, and is the key enzyme of ketone body utilization [6,13,14].  D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1), encoded by the BDH1 gene in human, is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of acetoacetate and (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, the two major ketone bodies produced during fatty acid catabolism [6].  BDH2 is a cytosolic type 2 (R)-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, distinct from the mitochondrial BDH1, may have role in cytosolic ketone body utilization, either as a secondary system for energy supply in starvation or to generate precursors for lipid and sterol synthesis [15].",b95973ec-f247-4e3f-a31b-ce46f78ffe45
3,methods3,"  Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT1), also known as acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, encoded by the ACAT1 gene in human, is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the reversible formation of acetoacetyl-CoA from two molecules of acetyl-CoA [6].  Specimens Archival de-identified formalin fixed paraffin embedded brain biopsy specimens were selected for this study. Preferences were given whenever possible to select blocks that contain both malignant tumor and small portions of adjacent relatively normal brain tissue that would serve as internal normal control for the immunohistochemistry reactions. These included 17 glioblastomas (glioblastomas (GBM)), 3 anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), and 2 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (AO) (Table 1).",8f2c2c6b-94f0-4275-bd87-ce8309d84ab4

11,methods11,"  Immunohistochemistry reactions were scored on a semi-quantitative basis: the tumor is considered positive (positive (POS)) if greater than 20% of tumor cells are positive, LOW if 5-20% of tumor cells are positive, and very low (very low (VLOW)) if less than 5% of tumor cells are positive. Internal controls, where possible, were represented by fragments of non-neoplastic brain tissue within the same sections in which the neurons would show positive granular labeling pattern for the metabolic enzymes (Figure 1), but negative for GFAP.  Figure 1 The malignant glioma cells (Case 1) show very low (VLOW) labeling for OXCT1 (A), whereas adjacent normal brain tissue show positive granular labeling pattern within neurons (B).

12,results0,"Twenty two de-identified patients were studied (Table 1). The mean age was 55 with 5 females and 17 males. Each specimen was evaluated for the expression of 4 ketolytic and 2 glycolytic enzymes (Figure 2). The mitochondrial enzymes OXCT1 and BDH1 were concordantly decreased in 15 of the 22 (68%). The cytoplasmic ketolytic enzyme BDH2 along with the mitochondrial ketolytic enzyme ACAT1 were concordantly positive (POS) in 15 of the 22 (68%). Only one patient (Case #4) had all 4 ketolytic enzymes scored as LOW or very low (VLOW).  Figure 2 Typical immunohistochemistry reactions of a glioblastomas (GBM) (Case #13).

13,results1," Stains for OXCT1 (C) show that most tumor cells are negative, with rare (less than 5%) cells (possibly entrapped native neurons) showing positive reaction (shown at higher magnification in the inset). Most cells also appear negative for BDH1 (D), but more than 20% of cells appear positive for BDH2 (E). A little more than 5% of tumor cells appear positive for ACAT1 (F) (shown at higher magnification in the inset). More than 20% of tumor cells are positive for the glycolytic enzymes HK2 (G) and PKM2 (H).  The 2 glycolytic enzymes, HK2, and PKM2, were variably expressed in these tumors. The mitochondria-associated HK2 was often decreased (16 of 22, 72%, were either LOW or very low (VLOW),) while the cytosolic PKM2 was more often positive (POS) (18 of 22, 81%). Of the 15 patients with concordantly decreased mitochondrial ketolytic enzymes OXCT1 and BDH1, 11 had positive expression of either one or both of their glycolytic enzymes, HK2 or PKM2.",4d8dda84-5fe7-44d2-b6e4-f13862849abf
14,results2, This was the most common ketolytic and glycolytic enzymatic profile observed. ,82a7673e-4d3b-4208-9687-73cb61773fa4
15,discussion0,"The present results show that the ketolytic and glycolytic enzymatic profiles of malignant brain tumors were different from the normal non-neoplastic brain tissue. The most common enzymatic profile was a decrease in the mitochondrial enzymes OXCT1 and BDH1 coupled with positive expression of the glycolytic enzymes HK2 and/or PKM2. These findings support the notion that many high grade brain tumors in humans have aberrant metabolism of ketones, and may preferentially use glucose for their energy needs.  The mitochondrial ketolytic enzymes OXCT1 and BDH1 were scored as decreased (LOW or very low (VLOW)) in 15 of the 22 (68%) specimens. The mitochondria-associated glycolytic enzyme HK2 was also often decreased (16 of 22, 72%), whereas the cytosolic ketolytic (BDH2) and glycolytic (PKM2) enzymes both showed positive reactions in most of the tumors. These results suggest that many of these tumors have alterations in mitochondrial metabolism.",ec0c0946-482f-4f19-a2f1-9d033c3606ad
16,discussion1," On the other hand, the positive expression of ACAT1, also a mitochondrial enzyme, in most tumors suggests that the observed decreases of OXCT1 and BDH1 do not necessarily reflect a complete loss or absence of mitochondria enzymes in these tumors.  Limitations of the present study Due to limited sample size, our data cannot determine conclusively the relationships, if any, between the expression of these enzymes with respect to the tumor grades, patients’ age and gender, recent treatments or medications (e.g., steroid), other co-morbidities, or survival. Our results also cannot address the issue of whether the enzyme measurements obtained from a biopsy sample would be representative of activity in the entire tumor since the histoarchitecture of glioblastomas (GBM) can often vary significantly from one region to the next.",45e93bff-fef8-4f18-b68f-aee29ed35ca3
17,discussion2," Nevertheless, our results showing that glioblastomas (GBM)s from different patients have different expression of these enzymes are consistent with previous molecular genetic studies showing that these are genetically heterogeneous tumors [1-3]. Our results are also consistent with a recent study showing variable but positive expression of the ketone body metabolizing enzymes in several human glioma cell lines [6].  Metabolic therapy for malignant gliomas Recent studies in animal models have shown promising results using either non-caloric restricted KD [5,6] or calorie restriction therapy [16,17] as alternative treatment strategy for malignant gliomas. While it is well known that calorie restriction can lead to the production of ketone bodies, calorie restriction is also known to activate protective genes [4,18]. On the other hand, ketone bodies, in addition to providing alternative energy source to normal brain tissue, can also serve to activate genes that promote survival [6].",9b136df2-cd3f-4aa8-a1e9-f234e37d8757
18,discussion3," Indeed, recent studies have shown that altered tumor metabolism and epigenetic mechanisms are intimately related in the maintenance of gliomas [19].  Conclusions Our results suggest that the variable ketolytic and glycolytic enzyme expression profiles in malignant gliomas potentially may be useful as biomarkers to sort patients in clinical trials of KD therapy. It seems reasonable to hypothesize that patients with low or very low expression of key ketolytic enzymes (e.g., OXCT1, BDH1) in their malignant gliomas may respond better to the KD therapy than those patients with positive expression of these enzymes. Further studies in animal models and/or a large-scale clinical trial would be needed to test this hypothesis. A better understanding of the modulation of the epigenetics by metabolic enzymes in gliomas is also needed to design future therapeutic strategies.",66140941-e4b0-4c1e-b4be-9a3973a15ff7
