0,methods0," In this retrospective study, individuals were recruited from the GENOMIT/PerMim collaborative research project. Inclusion criteria were biallelic variants in MDH1, MDH2, GOT2, SLC25A12, SLC25A13 or mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 classified as (likely) pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG, Bethesda, USA) guidelines [21]. Further eligible individuals were identified via literature review (PubMed search with restriction to the English language completed October 2021). If individuals were published previously, the respective authors were contacted for an update. If this was not received, only published data were included. All (de-identified) data were retrieved retrospectively via case report forms. Additionally, a written case report, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopies (magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS)) were requested.",faef5777-ba08-46f3-95ba-c4517c14b53e
1,methods1," All available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)s were reviewed by the same investigator (E.B.). The magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) acquisition and analysis in the individual AGC1-1 is detailed in the Supplementary Materials.  No literature review for SLC25A13 was performed as the treatment is well established and the data and their analysis would go beyond the scope of this article (for review see [11,22]).  Functional characterization of the AGC1 variants in patients AGC1-2/3 by measuring transport capacity and for AGC1-5, western blot analysis was performed in patient-derived fibroblasts (see Supplementary Materials).  3. Results  A summary of the clinical findings is presented in Table 1 (a–d) and Table 2 and Figure 2, the genetic findings in Table 2 and Table 3, and the follow-up on KD in Table 4.

2,methods2,"  From the defects with a predominantly neurological phenotype, we identified 14 AGC1/SLC25A12-deficient individuals of whom eight were treated with KD. For the other defects, the subject numbers were as follows (defect, (total/treated)): MDH1 deficiency (2/0), MDH2 deficiency (4/3), GOT2 deficiency (4/0), mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 deficiency (8/2).  For the hepatic phenotype of citrin/SLC25A13-deficiency, we identified eight individuals, of whom six followed a carbohydrate-restricted and fat-enriched diet.  Throughout the following text, specific features will be reported for the X subjects of the Y subjects with available information on that specific feature as (X/Y).  3.1. AGC1-Deficiency (SLC25A12)  3.1.1. Presentation before Initiation of KD  Fourteen affected individuals from 12 families were identified (Table 1a), of whom six from five families were previously unreported (AGC1-1 to AGC1-6) [16,17,23,24,25,26,27,28].",353df6c5-b674-481d-b3de-37f91874e973
3,methods3," The median age at presentation was two weeks (range: neonatal period–seven months) and the last follow-up (reported in 12/14) at a median of 5 years 7 months (range: 13 months–11 years); AGC1-13 died at the age of seven years.  The phenotype (Figure 2) was homogenous, with early onset epilepsy (13/13) and profound to severe global developmental disability (global developmental disability (GDD)) (12/12). Muscular hypotonia/weakness was seen in 10/13 individuals, of whom three developed spasticity. Two out of nine individuals had a primary developmental impairment, and all (9/9) showed regression or stagnation upon seizure onset. All individuals remained non-verbal (12/12). Highest achieved motor milestones reported were the ability to bear weight and to sit independently, in one case (AGC1-9) with the last follow-up at 13 months. Hyperkinetic movement disorder was reported in 4/9 individuals. 7/10 individuals had microcephaly, reported as secondary in four of these cases.",6be77efd-5fee-404c-9921-fa48d321d9f2
4,methods4," Failure to thrive (Failure to thrive (FTT)) and/or feeding difficulties were reported in 5/7 cases.  Age at epilepsy onset was reported in 13/14 and was between 40 days and 10 months (median 7 months). Epilepsy was refractory to therapy in 7/11 individuals. One subject (AGC1-12, [26]) was seizure-free at the age of three years when treated with phenobarbital and levetiracetam and later even without anti-seizure medication (anti seizure medication (ASM)) up to the age of 12 years. Then, seizures relapsed and were controlled with levetiracetam again. The remaining three individuals (AGC1-2/3/9) had only one anti seizure medication (ASM) tried but did not become seizure-free. Description of seizures/epilepsy was available in 10 individuals.",31f4c29a-0568-48d7-b943-fe63a3a99c25
5,methods5," Seizures were focal in origin with variable semiology (apnoea (4/10), tonic (3/10), clonic (4/10), tonic-clonic (3/10), myoclonic (2/10), seizures with odd laughter (2/10)); clusters of seizures (1/10), or status epilepticus (4/10) were reported as well.  The electroencephalogram (epilepticus (4/10) were reported as well The electroencephalogram (EEG)) was abnormal in all (10/10) with diffuse background slowing (7/10), focal slowing (2/10) and focal/multifocal or unspecified epileptic discharges (or seizure patterns) (9/10). In the remaining case (1/10) a voltage attenuation was the only feature reported.  Laboratory investigations revealed increased serum lactate levels (max. 7.2 (<2 mmol/L)), at least intermittently, in 9/12 individuals. Cerebrospinal fluid (Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) lactate was elevated in 3/4 individuals (max. 3 (1.1–1.7 mmol/L)). In AGC1-1, Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amino acids were analysed repeatedly. Serine was low normal to reduced (1.5–22.",eff11ed1-2573-43f6-bfbc-d57fe027ee16

Levels of these amino acids in plasma were within normal range.  Full magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)s were available in 3/14 individuals, and descriptions or exemplary images of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in an additional 7/14 individuals with one to five studies per subject. In two subjects, neuroimaging on KD was available with one and two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)s, respectively. Neuroimaging was best documented in AGC1-1, with three consecutive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)s (at age four months, seven months, and 21 months) before and one follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 19 months after initiation of KD. Representative images are shown in Figure 3.",20bc7a87-18b2-4117-8728-747cae5bb552
7,methods7," Two major features were found in all (untreated) cases (10/10): (1) progressive cerebral volume loss as evident from enlargement of the third and the lateral ventricles as well as dilated extracerebral spaces, (2) extensive abnormal signal characteristics in the supratentorial white matter showing a hyperintense signal in T2w as seen in “secondary (to neuronal disease) hypomyelination” [32] associated with thinned corpus callosum. In 2/10 subjects, multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)s revealed progression of myelination with age without becoming age appropriate. Normal myelination for age was reported in 2/10 early in the course (at seven, 10 months). In 3/10 individuals, cerebellar atrophy occurred and abnormalities in deep grey matter structures were reported in 2/10 individuals.  Eleven magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) were performed in 6/14 individuals, between the age of four months and six years (median 21 months).",a59d012c-8641-4d59-9d5b-4a62229eda7a
8,methods8," In AGC1-1 and AGC1-7, magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) was performed in parallel with each magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 4, Table 5, [16]). Before treatment, the main findings were a reduced N-acetyl-aspartate (N acetyl aspartate (NAA)) peak in 10/10 studies of 5/5 subjects and an increased myoinositol (mI) peak in 7/7 studies in 5/5 individuals (in AGC1-12, an magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) was done but neither N acetyl aspartate (NAA) nor mI was reported). Lactate peak was reported in four individuals (in seven magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS)) and was increased in five magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) of 3/4 subjects and normal in two magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) of 2/4. AGC1-1 showed initially normal and later, elevated lactate (Table 5).  3.1.2.",95ed5aa2-49f4-423a-b165-94d41e202ee7
9,methods9," Follow Up during KD  Eight of 14 individuals [16,17] received a classical KD (cKD), the most restrictive form of KD with a fixed ratio (2:1 to 4:1) between fat and non-fat nutrients (median age at initiation of KD was 2.2 years (14 months–6 years), median duration 19 months (1 month–2 years 7 months)). Ketosis was at a therapeutic level (BHB > 2 mmol/L) in 4/4 individuals.  Five out of eight individuals were still on cKD at the last follow-up. In AGC1-4, in whom cKD was initiated because of therapy refractory epilepsy when the genetic diagnosis was still unknown, cKD was stopped after 1 month because of intolerance (vomiting and gastrointestinal problems) and lack of efficacy. However, ketosis was not reported in this subject. The other two, the siblings AGC1-2 and AGC1-3, were discontinued because the cKD was not practicable anymore for the family.",026f9cdc-fd74-4995-92f3-f3abc9017acd
10,methods10,"  The most evident effect of cKD was a rapid and dramatic reduction in seizure frequency in 7/8, with seizure freedom at the last follow-up in all (5/5) individuals, who were still on cKD. Seizures relapsed associated with low ketosis (accidental or due to non-compliance) in 2/8, and in 1/8 during therapeutic ketosis. However, in these individuals, an increase in the ketogenic ratio from 3:1 to 4:1 led to seizure freedom again. anti seizure medication (ASM) could be tapered off in 2/6 subjects with efficacy of KD, were reduced in 1/6, and remained unchanged in 3/6. The epilepticus (4/10) were reported as well The electroencephalogram (EEG) findings improved in 6/6 individuals and normalised in one of these.  Muscle tone, head control and development improved considerably in 6/8 and remained unchanged in the other subjects.",39986f74-fafb-4f11-9df6-b9e9c26e5c53
11,methods11," Spasticity developed in 2/6 and AGC1-2 already had limb spasticity before the introduction of cKD at age 5 years 8 months and had no benefit from cKD on muscle tone nor development. His younger sister though, who started cKD at the age of 1 year 4 months, was (still) hypotonic and improved on cKD.  The highest motor ability (AGC1-5) was independent walking, achieved within two years on diet at age 4 years 6 months. This individual was neither sitting nor crawling before the introduction of cKD. 3/8 individuals learned to sit independently. Social interaction and communication were reported to improve considerably in 4/8 subjects but all remained non-verbal.  The choreo-athetotic movements in AGC1-1 ceased almost immediately after the introduction of cKD, and hypotonic-dyskinetic movement disorder in AGC1-5 improved, enabling him to achieve independent walking.  2/7 of individuals who initially showed impressive developmental progress, experienced stagnation of development.",6fe7fe3f-7a7a-437e-a175-f5a421217a3d
12,methods12," Of those, ketosis was stable in one (AGC1-1) and highly fluctuating due to probable mal-compliance in the other (AGC1-3).  Laboratory follow-up was only available for AGC1-1 and AGC1-3. In AGC1-1, abnormal liver function tests just before the introduction of cKD (gamma-glutamyl-transferase (gGT) 694 (< 23 U/L), alanine amino transferase (amino transferase (ALT)) 88 (< 28 U/L), aspartate amino transferase (amino transferase (AST)) 47 (< 50 U/L) normalised within six months. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was not repeated. In AGC1-3, serum lactate levels decreased from 3.1–5.7 mmol/L to 1.6–3.5 mmol/L.  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up after the introduction of cKD was available in 2/8 cases. AGC1-1 had one imaging study after 19 months, AGC1-7 two (after six months and 19 months). A substantial reduction in the size of the ventricles and extracerebral spaces and a marked improvement in myelination was seen (Figure 3, [16]).",b4779b9f-654d-4697-8d62-6d26079b59cb
13,methods13,"  magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) follow-up was available in all three imaging studies of the 2/8 individuals with magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) before cKD (for AGC1-1 see also Table 5 and Figure 4). The N acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentration and ratio to creatine increased from pre-cKD values in AGC1-1. In AGC1-7, a comparison between magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) after six months to pre-treatment magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) was only possible for N acetyl aspartate (NAA)/creatinine ratio, which improved. N acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentration after six months was normal in basal ganglia but still reduced in occipital white and grey matter. After 19 months, N acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentration increased in white matter and grey matter compared to the first magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) on treatment, the N acetyl aspartate (NAA)/creatinine ratio remained stable.",909be254-9dce-4243-805c-7d30b3226feb
14,methods14," In AGC1-1, mI and lactate normalised, choline remained normal compared to the magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) just before the introduction of cKD at 21 months of age. Information on these compounds was lacking for subject AGC1-7.  3.2. MDH1-Deficiency (MDH1)  The literature search revealed two children (cousins) with MDH1-deficiency ([29], Table 1b). None of them was treated with KD. The initial presentation was described in MDH1-1 only. He was born at 32 weeks of gestation and in NICU (7 days) for weight management. One week after discharge he was re-hospitalized because of respiratory distress. When published, they were 2 ½ (MDH1-1) and 4 years (MDH1-2) old, though clinical features of MDH1-1 were updated at the age of 14 months at the latest. In both, the central nervous system was predominantly affected by global developmental delay, epilepsy and strabismus. Microcephaly was reported in both, as progressive in one.",ed8d25da-2198-41c3-8a65-5655987127ef
15,methods15," Both had comparable dysmorphic features: plagiocephaly, bulbous nose, deep eyes, frontal bossing and micrognathia. Laboratory investigations showed normal plasma amino acids, acylcarnitine, lactate, and urine organic acid analysis. In dry blood, high glutamate and reduced glutamine/glutamate ratio were found and untargeted metabolomics revealed increased glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P). Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed abnormalities in the corpus callosum in both. Additionally, in MDH1-1, reduced myelin in posterior regions, cerebral atrophy and mild hypoplastic inferior vermis and pontine hypoplasia was reported.  3.3. MDH2-Deficiency (MDH2)  3.3.1. Presentation before Initiation of KD  There are four unrelated subjects with MDH2 deficiency published to date ([30,31], Table 1b).",9d53babd-ccb1-44b2-8b85-ff2f68b2582d
16,methods16," The initial presentation was between birth and five months with muscle hypotonia (2/4), severe constipation (1/4), febrile seizures (1/4) and macrosomia, macrocephaly and two supernumerary nipples (1/4). Three subjects were still alive at the last follow-up at four, five and 12 years, respectively. MDH2-2 died at the age of 1 years 8 months secondary to metabolic decompensation.  All subjects developed epilepsy in the first months of life, which became refractory to anti seizure medication (ASM) in 3/4. Developmental delay and muscle hypotonia were reported in all and muscle weakness in 3/3. Two out of three were reported to have dystonia and 1/3 additional dyskinesia. Pyramidal signs were described in 2/3. MDH2-4 experienced a metabolic stroke in the left nucleus lentiformis, causing hyperkinetic and choreatiform movement disorder. The highest achieved milestones were crawling at 18 months (MDH2-1) and babbling at 12 months (MDH2-2).",52591929-7710-4202-8325-6df88a99c724
17,methods17," Strabismus was reported in 2/2, whereas in one of them, a retinitis pigmentosa was diagnosed at the age of 4 years (MDH2-2). Failure to thrive necessitating tube feeding was seen in 3/4, while 1/3 showed body measurements within the upper normal limits (MDH2-2 at 18 months +1SD for HC, length and weight).  All subjects showed elevated plasma lactate (2.8–5.7 (<1.7 mmol/L)), lactate to pyruvate ratio (20–63 (<18)) and 3/3 had increased Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate (2.25 and 3.3 (<1.7 mmol/L)). Elevated urinary malate (2/2) and fumarate (in 2/3, at least in some measurements) was found, while succinate was normal in 3/3.  Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebral atrophy in 3/3, most prominent in the anterior parts of the brain in 2/3, cerebellar atrophy in 2/4 and delayed myelination in 3/4. Germinolytic (pseudo)cysts were described in 1/4.  magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) was done in 3/4 and revealed elevated lactate peak in all of them.  3.3.2.",5f9b5d21-7b72-481e-b453-c335cdef82a0
18,methods18," Follow Up during KD  cKD was given to 3/4 subjects (Table 4). A reduction of seizure frequency was reported in 2/3 subjects. No further information about the diet and its effect is available. However, 1/3 individuals died shortly after the introduction of KD (1/2 subjects with benefit on epilepsy). He had vomiting, coughing, tachypnoea and impaired consciousness associated with fatal metabolic decompensation (lactate acidosis, excretion of ketone bodies and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites). MDH2-4 received triheptanoin and had improvement in muscle tone, motor abilities and communication [31].  3.4. GOT2-Deficiency (GOT2)  Four affected individuals from three unrelated families have been reported ([32], Table 1c). None of them was treated with KD. All cases had mainly central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)) affected and presented within the first month of life with feeding difficulties (4/4), drooling (2/4) and developmental impairment (4/4).",c24f73c8-d4e1-4837-b8d3-f8cf2b71f449
19,methods19," The last clinical follow-up was between four and 10 years of age.  Maximal motor achievement was the ability to sit independently (GOT2-3 at eight years) and the best language skill was speaking three to four words (GOT2-2 at 10 years). All (4/4) subjects had muscle hypotonia initially, and later developed spasticity and progressive microcephaly. Infantile epilepsy (onset at age 4 to 9 months) occurred in 4/4 and became refractory to anti seizure medication (ASM) in 2/4. All individuals were prone to infections.  Laboratory investigations showed increased serum lactate in 4/4 (3.0–5.7 (0.5–2.2 mmol/L)) and hyperammonaemia in 4/4 (during infancy: between 110 and 143 (16–60 μmol/L) in 4/4). For the two individuals not treated with serine and pyridoxine, the values were still increased at the age of 10 (GOT2-2) and eight years (GOT2-3) (70 and 75 (11–32 μmol/L)).",5a5daa13-1c0a-44e6-8abc-fec7aeabaa94

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebral atrophy in all individuals, a hypoplastic vermis in 3/4 and a thin (2/4) or hypoplastic (1/4) corpus callosum. 1/4 had additional multi-cystic encephalomalacia. No follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)s were reported.  Treatment  Treatment with serine and pyridoxine was given in variable dosages in 2/4 individuals (GOT2-2, GOT2-3). On this treatment, both individuals that had refractory epilepsy before and achieved seizure freedom, and in ½, it was possible to taper off all anti seizure medication (ASM). 2/2 were described as more alert. 1/2 started to fixate objects.

Presentation before Initiation of KD  Eight individuals with mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 deficiency from six unrelated families were identified ([33], Table 1d). Three families have not been reported yet (mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-1 to 4). Additionally, in one family mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-deficiency was diagnosed metabolically in a consecutive pregnancy, which was terminated [19].  The initial presentation was—if reported—at birth in 4/5 with muscle hypotonia in 3/4, respiratory distress and elevated lactate in 1/5. Seizures were the first symptom in 1/5 (onset 6 years).

However, all 8/8 had central nervous system (CNS) involvement and developmental impairment. Severity was variable even within a family (mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-7/8). In 3/8, the developmental impairment was mild. In one of them, initial milestones were achieved normally but, at the age of 12 years, his IQ was tested 56. Developmental impairment was severe to profound in the remaining individuals. Other central nervous system (CNS) features were muscle hypotonia (5/6), epilepsy (4/5) and microcephaly (3/5).

BHB was sub-therapeutic before the age of 16 months. The only therapeutic level reported was 3.7 mmol/L after a meal at 16 months. Therefore, in retrospect, the KD might have been insufficiently strict to be successful. She had a progressive neurological disease and died at 1 year 7 months of age. In contrast, individual mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-1 had distinct improvement in his clinical condition. The last follow-up on cKD was after four years of treatment (age 5 years 3 months).

Muscle tone and head control increased, he was able to roll over and was trying to sit up. However, the subjects’ secondary microcephaly was progressive. At the start of cKD, spasms were treated with vigabatrin and lamotrigine. On cKD, an initial reduction of spasms was seen after one week. Spasms increased after 2 ½ months again and exacerbated after six months. At that time, topiramate was introduced and cKD was intensified from 2.5:1 to 4:1. This led to a seizure-free period of 12 months, even though vigabatrin and topiramate were tapered off. Then, myoclonic seizures occurred. The increase of lamotrigine reduced seizure frequency and at the latest one to two seizures per day were reported.  The serum lactate levels in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-1 normalised during KD.

29,methods29," Despite this, signs of fatty liver disease were present in three of them. Of note, none had shown hypoglycaemias.  Individuals AGC2-3 and AGC2-8 with ‘NICCD-subtypes’ were detected by new born screening and treated from the age of five and four weeks (both currently aged 4 ½ years), respectively. AGC2-7 represents the ‘failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (Failure to thrive (FTT)DCD)-subtype’ with failure to thrive, cholestasis and elevated triglycerides recognized at the age of six months. AGC2-4 and AGC2-6 were diagnosed based on their positive family history aged four weeks and 12 days, respectively. In line with their early diagnosis, they had only mild laboratory anomalies that normalised within seven to 10 days. The remaining subject (AGC2-1) presented aged four months with hepatomegaly and suggestive laboratory findings.",e98bba75-b524-4f2e-8f4a-39b06d719a56
30,methods30," Of note, none of the individuals with ‘NICCD’ or ‘failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (Failure to thrive (FTT)DCD)’-subtypes had shown hypoglycaemias.  3.7. Genotypes  As shown in Table 3, we identified 34 different variants in our cohort, of these, twelve variants have not been published before and extend the genotypic spectrum. Of note, in our Caucasian individuals with citrin deficiency two variants previously reported in Asian individuals were found and four novel variants.  3.8. Functional Investigations  The variant c.1618G > A identified in AGC1-2/3 causes the substitution of the amino acid aspartate in position 540 into an asparagine. The aspartate in position 540 is a part of the sequence motif PX[D/E]XX[K/R] conserved in all mitochondrial carriers [38] and is involved in the salt-bridge network on the matrix side that is important for the function of the mitochondrial carriers [39].",52114ec5-13ce-4289-8ac8-021c5424f21f
31,methods31," To test the functional relevance of the identified mutation we measured the transport activity of the D540N mutant upon reconstitution of purified recombinant proteins into liposomes. As shown in Figure 5A, the substitution of Asp540 with asparagine caused a complete loss of activity in accordance with the predicted involvement of Asp540 in the transport mechanism.  In AGC1-5 the c.225del mutation generates an early truncated and not functioning form of the protein, p.(Glu76Serfs*17); the second mutation (c.1747C > A) is a synonymous variant predicted to alter the splicing. Therefore, we performed western blot analysis on fibroblasts confirming that compound-heterozygous variants led to a complete loss of the AGC1 protein expression in the subject (Figure 5B).

32,methods32," Discussion  By collecting and analysing this cohort of a total of 40 individuals with defects in the malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS)/mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1, we can further delineate the phenotypes (Figure 2, Table 1 and Table 2) and extend the genotypic spectrum with 12 novel variants. Individuals with defects in the malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS) showed a neurological phenotype in all defects. The complex disorder citrin deficiency can present with an isolated hepatic clinical presentation in infancy and childhood but also lead to a neuropsychiatric phenotype in adulthood. In the thirteen of the “neurological malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS)” individuals, who were treated with KD, we outline the clinical course and add further evidence for the efficacy (Table 4).  4.1.",e5f6d49a-4063-43e9-a0be-a85b9bfd353c
33,methods33," Phenotype  This “neurological malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS)” phenotype was uniform with early onset epilepsy, muscle hypotonia and a severe global developmental impairment with reduced cerebral myelin. The shared but non-specific metabolic marker was—at least intermittently—elevated lactate. This is in line with the predominant cerebral expression and the function of the malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS): linking glycolysis with mitochondrial respiration as well as the synthesis of aspartate and glutamate, the most important excitatory neurotransmitter (reviewed in [10]).  Paucity of cerebral myelin was seen in all neuronal malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS)-defects but GOT2-deficiency. In AGC1-deficiency, the reduction of normal myelin signal was interpreted as a secondary phenomenon, as a consequence of neuronal dysfunction [41,42].",d43298a1-7a42-4a15-a43e-95fa9048ae63
34,methods34," Not only AGC1, but all malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS) components play a crucial role in mitochondrial respiration, when glucose or lactate are the substrates. A defect of this shuttle leads to a shortage of energy supply leading to a malfunction or degeneration of neurons. Intact neuronal metabolism is necessary for the maintenance and formation of myelin. Another proposed mechanism leading to reduced myelin is the importance of malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS) in supplying precursors of myelin synthesis such as aspartate and N acetyl aspartate (NAA) [16,43]. A low level of aspartate and N acetyl aspartate (NAA), together with reduced myelin, was found in the brains and cultured neurons of AGC1 knock-out (KO) mice [43]. In agreement with this, aspartate was not detected in Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AGC1-1, a finding reported for the first time in humans. Interestingly, aspartate was normal in serum, likely because AGC2 is the main isoenzyme expressed in the liver.",618ca725-f144-48ce-804c-c04c25e14221
35,methods35," Unfortunately, no Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on KD was investigated. However, aspartate increased from pre-KD magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) to magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) on KD (data not shown). A drawback is that no reference values for aspartate in magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) are available. Furthermore, aspartate serves as amino donor for de novo glutamate synthesis [44]. Neurotransmitter imbalances are well-known reasons for the development of seizures and epilepsy, a main clinical feature of these individuals.  The subjects with mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-deficiency showed a broader phenotypic spectrum. Also, in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-deficiency, glycolysis-related energy production, the main energy source for the brain is hampered [45]. All individuals had developmental impairment but of very variable severity, and epilepsy was only reported in less than half of the individuals, with a greater age range of onset.",6729222d-8409-4a27-9a5e-f6f4646e9078
36,methods36," mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 is expressed in many organs, and we here present the first individual with the additional features of splenomegaly, bone fractures after minor trauma and insulin-dependent, anti-body negative diabetes mellitus. This is in line with findings in a mouse model with hypo-morphism of Mpc2 which showed impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [46]. Additionally, the inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) was shown to play a key role in the regulation of insulin secretion in a cellular model (832/13 β-cells) and isolated pancreatic islets from rats and humans [47] and a general role of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) in diabetes is outlined in [48]. Other clinical features were peripheral neuropathy, muscle weakness, dysmorphic features, congenital heart defect and growth failure [19,33].  4.2.",a248f6de-79c2-4be6-9c19-b1ce39e72475
37,methods37," Effect of KD on Neurological malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS)-Defects and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-Deficiency  Of the 13 KD-treated individuals with the neuronal malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS)-defects and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-defect, the KD was mainly beneficial in 11, at least temporarily. Ten of the 13 (77%) subjects had substantial seizure reduction and five with AGC1-deficiency were still seizure free at the last follow-up. This indicates a higher efficacy of KD in this cohort than the generally expectable 40–50% chance of at least 50% seizure reduction [49]. The majority remained on the KD, not only pointing to a high efficacy but also tolerability.  In AGC1- and MDH2-deficiency, the most striking and most immediate effect was the one against seizures in these severe epilepsies. A reason might be that KD acts not only by bypassing the defect but has also a general antiseizure effect [49].",edfba10f-3479-45bd-9035-b48d2205e80c
38,methods38," Though much less impressively, also muscle tone and motor abilities improved. The individuals were more alert, but communicative skills remained very basal and developmental impairment was still severe to profound. The data we collected on previously unreported cases were in agreement with the previously published data. In mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-deficiency, we report for the first time a beneficial clinical course on KD. Additionally, the efficacy against epilepsy was paramount, while, besides more alertness and social interaction, no clear-cut improvement of development was seen.  In addition, we can show that the liver dysfunction in one individual (AGC1-1) improved rapidly and normalised about 6 months after the introduction of KD, which might be a hint that the liver dysfunction was a direct consequence of the metabolic defect. We have no reports on hepatic transaminases from other subjects.",abbb7bc8-d1d8-40cf-9eac-89270252bb7c
39,methods39,"  Follow-up cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on KD was only available in two subjects with AGC1-deficiency The previously published findings of AGC1-7 [16,23] were confirmed in the study of AGC1-1, namely a striking increase in myelin and a decrease of inner and outer Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces indicating an increase of volume (Figure 3). All these changes point towards a recuperation of cerebral neurons.  Follow-up magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) on KD was performed in the subjects with AGC1-deficiency in whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done, too. The findings in the individual published by Dahlin et al. [16] were confirmed, in that in AGC1-1 an increase in N acetyl aspartate (NAA) was also seen (see Table 5) in both N acetyl aspartate (NAA)/creatinine ratio and N acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentration. It is not completely known, why N acetyl aspartate (NAA) is reduced in AGC1-deficiency.",f96e4000-fab3-4cc8-a0a1-66d90c36bf31
40,methods40," One reason for low N acetyl aspartate (NAA) in AGC1-deficiency was proposed to be diminished N acetyl aspartate (NAA) synthesis as a consequence of the low precursor aspartate (see Figure 1, [16,43]). Further, N acetyl aspartate (NAA) is a surrogate marker of neuronal density and integrity [50] and decreases secondary to neuronal degeneration.  The analysis of the magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) in the subject AGC1-1 showed spectral peaks in the residuals of the LCModel which did not fit with any metabolites attributed in the basis set [51]. Therefore, the model was complemented by simulated peaks for glycerol, which led to a reduction of these residuals, or in other words showed a good fit with the spectra (see Figure 4). The peaks thus reflect glycerol or a very similar molecule. In a second step, magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) was run on a glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) phantom which revealed comparable peaks.",95d640d5-4b76-45dd-a3a5-7ad3e603a789
41,methods41," These Glycerol/G3P peaks were seen only before treatment with KD and resolved on KD. This points to an increase in G3P in AGC1. In AGC1-KO mice, increased activity of the G3P-shuttle was suggested. This G3P-shuttle, mainly situated in astrocytes, recycles NAD+ and is thus an alternative to lactate production [10,52] (see Figure 1). Because the rate-limiting step in the G3P-shuttle is the isomerisation from G3P into dihydroxyacetone phosphate, G3P would accumulate. Thus, our findings support the suggestion of increased G3P-shuttle activity and the rescue of the malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS) defect in AGC1-deficiency by KD. Furthermore, there exists also evidence for increased G3P in another malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS) defect, the MDH1 [29].  4.3. Serine Supplementation  Another consequence of malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS) defects is reduced serine.",3dcd006f-ceaa-4a0a-94b5-555297393967
42,methods42," One mechanism might be reduced serine-synthesis, a metabolic branch of glycolysis, which is also dependent on the availability of NAD+ (see Figure 1). However, in the brain, serine is mainly synthesised by glial cells (for a review [53]). Therefore, another explanation for low serine, proposed by Pardo et al. [44], would be increased serine-utilization for pyruvate-synthesis, as the pyruvate-lactate ratio drops. Reduced serine was previously described in GOT2-deficiency [32] and low Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-serine was reported for the first time in one of the AGC1-deficient individuals (AGC1-1). In GOT2-deficiency, serine was supplemented together with pyridoxin/vitamin B6 because GOT2 is pyridoxin-dependent. And a clinical improvement was observed. No KD was performed. In the individual with AGC1-deficiency and low Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-serine, serine was substituted (together with glycine) and normalised, but no clear clinical benefit was seen.",d6759b4a-c8a0-4a4a-b760-5d737ac10e93
43,methods43," In this subject, it was the treatment with KD that led to an impressive clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) improvement. This indicates that the reduced Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serine is not the main cause of the clinical features and serine supplementation does not rescue the NADH/NAD imbalance caused by AGC1 deficiency. However, supplementation still might be supportive.  Taken together, this cohort highlights once again the need for early genetic diagnostics in children with epileptic seizures and developmental delays.  4.4. Citrin Deficiency  In line with this, we wish to raise awareness of the complex disorder of citrin deficiency in Europe. Our eight cases of citrin deficiency were all but one (German case) diagnosed and treated in Austria.",ec33f969-c872-4fac-8540-873e0f10c4f5
44,methods44," Due to confusing laboratory markers—and presumably additionally because of the rarity of citrin deficiency outside the Asian population—citrin deficiency was not suspected in two cases and treatment with high carbohydrates and protein restriction was initiated. Both individuals did not survive and did also not receive the appropriate treatment since high carbohydrate supplementation was given based on a misdiagnosis of a urea cycle disorder or tyrosinemia. In all other cases with appropriate treatment, the course of the disease was only mild.",8e0726b0-c700-43db-8e02-75d4b0711210
45,methods45,"  Our cases further highlight the broad phenotypic spectrum, showing intermediate types in addition to the three classically defined subtypes (neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (‘NICCD’), failure to thrive and dyslipidaemia caused by citrin deficiency (‘failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (Failure to thrive (FTT)DCD)’), adult-onset recurrent hyperammonaemia with neuropsychiatric symptoms in citrullinemia type II (‘CTLN2′)) and should prompt genetic evaluation early in the course of suggestive cases.  4.5. Limitations  Taking into account the rarity of these disorders, we are able to add a considerable number of new subjects and expand the scarce experience in this field. However, the small number of subjects reported and the retrospective study design are obvious weaknesses of the study. The KDs were not uniform and blood BHB levels were not available in all individuals, though, at least, all received a classical KD.",06283e17-ea4b-4807-83dd-a78937719028
46,methods46," Still, the lack of a standardised KD (e.g., by a target BHB-level range) limits the interindividual comparability of the effect. In some children, an increase in the cKD ratio improved the effect and we cannot exclude that this might have led to a greater benefit also in others.  5. Conclusions  The malate aspartate shuttle system (MAS)/mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1- defects are a group of rare diseases with either a neurological phenotype with early onset epilepsy, muscle hypotonia and a severe global developmental impairment or a hepatopathy (citrin deficiency). The course is progressive and severe if left untreated, often leading to early death. The majority of individuals benefited from the treatment with KD (or fat enrichment/carbohydrate restriction in case of hepatopathy/citrin deficiency). This study—once again—highlights the need for (early genetic) diagnosis to aid pathomechanism-based treatment.",dc98c430-a090-4b96-a9b5-c52c48660aff
47,methods47, It further underlines that not only paediatric but especially adult individuals with complex disorders should be referred to specialized centres with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. ,6179cf78-2215-4b1a-aa0b-9f42dab187be
