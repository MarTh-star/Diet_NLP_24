0,introduction0," Glioblastoma (glioblastoma (GBM)) has among the highest mortality rates for primary brain tumors and remains poorly manageable. Despite the hype surrounding recent therapies (1–5), median life expectancy following diagnosis remains poor for most glioblastoma (GBM) patients (6–9). Survival is slightly better, however, for younger glioblastoma (GBM) patients compared to older glioblastoma (GBM) patients and for patients with glioblastoma (GBM) tumors that express IDH1 mutations (10–14). Most glioblastoma (GBM) patients receive the current standard of care (standard of care (SOC)) involving surgical debulking, radiotherapy, and temozolomide (temozolomide (TMZ)) chemotherapy (15, 16). Many glioblastoma (GBM) patients can also receive corticosteroid medication (dexamethasone) and bevacizumab for managing edema and angiogenesis, respectively.",00695372-5882-47bf-80ba-df51662b5ab2
1,introduction1," Use of steroids is now under serious reevaluation, as steroids can elevate blood glucose, which is associated with more rapid tumor growth and shortened overall survival (17, 18). The current standard of care (SOC) for glioblastoma (GBM) has only marginally improved overall survival compared to “best supportive care,” which is ambiguous at best (19, 20). Equally distressing to management failure is evidence that the incidence of glioblastoma (GBM) is increasing in the United Kingdom (21).  We recently reviewed studies describing the adverse effects that can be associated with the current standard of care (SOC) for glioblastoma (GBM) management (17). glioblastoma (GBM), like most malignant cancers, is driven by glucose and glutamine fermentation through the glycolysis and glutaminolysis pathways, respectively (22–27).",43e6b0bd-119c-4f48-a57a-52472960b7ce
2,introduction2," The dependency on glucose and glutamine fermentation arises from inefficient oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) that is linked to abnormalities in the number, structure, and function of mitochondria in glioblastoma (GBM) tissue (17, 26–33). Surgical debulking followed by radiotherapy inadvertently increases the availability of glucose and glutamine in the tumor microenvironment (17, 34, 35). temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy can further damage mitochondria while, at the same time, increasing systemic inflammation and tumor driver mutations (36, 37). Bevacizumab is even more likely than temozolomide (TMZ) to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in human brain tumors, and is remarkable in its ability to facilitate distal tumor cell invasion through the neural parenchyma and the perivascular network (38–40). Use of dexamethasone can further accelerate glioblastoma (GBM) growth by increasing blood glucose levels and glutamine metabolism (25, 41–44).",f6e6254d-fb71-43b2-ae5a-943efad2547a
3,introduction3," In light of this information, the poor progression free and overall survival experienced by most glioblastoma (GBM) patients receiving the standard of care (SOC) should not be surprising.  Winter and colleagues coined the term “Ketogenic Metabolic Therapy (Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT))” to describe an anti-neoplastic nutritional strategy, using ketogenic or low-glycemic diets, for the management of malignant gliomas (45). Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) is gaining recognition as a complementary therapeutic strategy for the management of a broad range of cancers in addition to malignant gliomas (17, 19, 45–60). Low carbohydrate, high fat ketogenic diets (KD) reduce the glucose needed to drive aerobic fermentation (Warburg effect) while also elevating ketone bodies, which cannot be effectively metabolized for energy in tumor cells due to defects in mitochondrial OxPhos (17, 26, 45, 56, 61–67).",b1cd3b7c-6363-4fb6-a3c1-0fa338505937
4,introduction4," Moreover, ketone body metabolism enhances the ΔG′ATP hydrolysis in normal cells from −56kJ/mole to −59kJ/mole, thus providing normal cells with an energetic advantage over tumor cells (27, 68, 69). Calorie restriction and restricted KD are also anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-invasive, and can kill tumor cells directly through pro-apoptotic mechanisms (17, 62, 70–73). Evidence also shows that therapeutic ketosis can act synergistically with several drugs and procedures to enhance cancer management thus improving both progression free and overall survival (26, 74–76). Hence, Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) targets the multiple drivers of rapid glioblastoma (GBM) growth while enhancing the metabolic efficiency of normal brain cells (56).",50ff0ea2-720e-4970-8b86-9ca0a042ce21
5,introduction5,"  Case Report  A 26-year-old male from South Devon presented on August 16, 2014 at University Hospitals Plymouth National Health Service (NHS) Trust, PL6 8DH, UK, with two episodes of left-sided facial numbness and bilateral tonic-clonic seizures originating from the right temporal lobe. There was no history of malignancy or chronic disorders. The patient's blood pressure was within normal limits (110/70). Laboratory investigation revealed unremarkable blood chemistry, with liver and renal functions within normal limits. Fasting blood glucose and C-Reactive protein were within normal ranges. Prior to therapeutic intervention, the patient's weight, height, and body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) were 63 kg, 180 centimeters, and 19.4 kg/m2, respectively.

The lesion discovered on August 2018 is centered in the right inferior frontal lobe (A,B, arrowheads), and abuts the premotor cortex (C, arrowhead). There is an enhancing nodule within the lesion, as seen in the magnified post-contrast image (D) (arrow). This enhancing lesion measured 1.25 mL, which is calculated using the V = ABC/2 formula.

8,introduction8,"  Enhanced MRI of the brain (August 22, 2014) showed a lobar T2 signal abnormality without restricted diffusion and with central ring enhancement centered on the opercula portion of the inferior frontal gyrus. Signal change also extended into the precentral gyrus (Figure 1, Panel 1, C). The preliminary impression was a transforming low-grade glioma. Histopathological analysis (September 16, 2014) of seven cream and white cores of brain biopsy tissue revealed a diffuse cortical infiltration by a paucicellular glial neoplasm composed of predominantly fibrillary and occasional gemistocytic astrocytes. The tumor cells were moderately pleomorphic with infrequent/rare mitosis. There was focal micro-calcification and focal microvascular proliferation (Figure 2A), but no necrosis was about present. The MIB-1 (Ki67) proliferation index was 4–6% (Figure 2B). The tumor cells were immune-reactive with antibodies to mutant IDH1 (R132H) and to patchy P53 expression.",f5cf8fe1-075d-4f11-bbf2-fe5deb79981d

Due to the patient's cultural beliefs regarding toxic therapies, he refused the recommended standard of care (SOC).",cc7cff2d-1e95-4336-b8a9-0c4cc503decf
10,introduction10," Instead, he opted for self-administering ketogenic metabolic therapy (Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT)) that was initiated 2 weeks after the histopathological diagnosis of glioblastoma (GBM). The patient was motivated to educate himself on proper implementation of the diet, replacing the recommended standard of care (SOC) with Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) despite pressure from his healthcare providers to use standard of care (SOC). The energy composition of his daily diet consisted of fat (1,696 kcal), protein (264 kcal), and carbohydrates (48 kcal) with the addition of MCT oil (medium chain triglycerides). He was prescribed levetiracetam (750 mg, 2x/day) for seizure management, and MCT oil (3 tsp daily with food). He strictly followed the ketogenic diet guidelines found on Patricia Daly's website (https://patriciadaly.",7b9d2025-de43-486b-a0bd-21d42208d8c6

It took the patient 2 weeks to enter the predicted zone of therapeutic ketosis, i.e., glucose/ketone index (Glucose Ketone Index (GKI)) values near 2.0 or below, as previously described (77). A second MRI of his tumor conducted on January 24, 2015 revealed no noticeable progression.  Serial MRIs preformed on April 14, 2015; July 17, 2015; November 16, 2015; February 20, 2016; July 9, 2016; and October 29, 2016 revealed evidence of interval slow contrast-enhanced tumor progression over that seen on the original 2014 MRI. MRI evidence of contrast-enhancing disease progression was more concerning on the follow-up MRI from December 15, 2016 (Figure 1, Panel 1, H).",d26ef798-8eb9-4101-8b38-6d4b8fc18f3a
12,introduction12," In response to these observed changes, the patient opted for an awake debulking craniotomy in April 2017. Excision was uneventful, resulting in gross complete removal of the mixed solid-necrotic contrast enhancing component of the glioblastoma (GBM). However, the largest T2 hyperintense part of the glioblastoma (GBM) remained untouched (Figure 1, Panel 2, A–C). Histological analysis of the tumor tissue showed a diffusely invasive astrocytic tumor with infrequent/rare mitosis, prominent microvascular proliferation (Figure 2C) and areas of necrosis (Figure 2D). The tumor cells expressed mutant IDH1 (R132H), P53 (patchy), and showed loss of nuclear ATRX expression. The overall histological features were in keeping with the diagnosis of IDH1-mutant glioblastoma (WHO Grade 4).  The patient continued with a strict ketogenic diet regimen following tumor debulking and maintained his Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) values at or near 2.0 and below.",56a81cb8-e705-4d00-9683-7b8129b6bbd5
13,introduction13," The following medications were taken for 1 week only after the craniotomy and included Epilim (200 mg), dexamethasone (2 mg), omeprazole (20 mg), and paracetamol (1 g) for post-surgical pain management. Tonic-clonic seizure activity, which increased after the craniotomy, gradually subsided over time. Various supplements were added to the diet that included vitamins, minerals, turmeric, resveratrol, omega-3, and boswellia serrata. No further tumor growth was seen on the MRI preformed on August 17, 2017. As the patient believed that his glioblastoma (GBM) was under control, he relaxed his adherence to low-carbohydrate foods. This resulted in modest body weight gain (89 kg) and elevated his Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) values to the 5–10 range indicative of increased blood glucose and reduced ketone levels.  An MRI preformed on October 9, 2018 showed interval progression of the lesion.",381b4c30-56a3-483f-95bd-dcb7b9d0c290
14,introduction14," The patient quickly realized that the regrowth of his tumor might have been linked in part to the relaxation of his dietary rigor. Along with optimization and intensification of the dietary regime, the patient adopted lifestyle interventions including moderate physical training, breathing exercises, and physiological stress management. As of November 2018, the patient has adhered to a two-meal/day schedule with a rigorous time-restricted eating regimen (20 h/day fasting). The diet consisted of eggs, bacon fried in ghee/butter (11:00 h), and steak, lamb chops, beef patties, and liver, all fried in ghee/butter/lard (16:00 h). The patient did not continue with MCT oil after he started the carnivore diet. The patient did not keep a specific food diary. When he was on a restricted calorie ketogenic diet, he would start out by weighing his food and keeping under 2,000 calories/day, but he ended up learning to judge food intake by how hungry he was and ate until he was satiated.",3ff66533-a287-4809-871f-7ad5a60d30a2
15,introduction15," Carbohydrates were strictly eliminated from the patient's diet. The patient recognized that a well-formulated animal-based Paleo-carnivore diet would provide most bio-available micronutrients (78). This carnivore nutritional fasting schedule returned the patient's Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) values to 2.0 or below. The patient's body mass index (BMI) normalized to 22.2 (72 kg) at the time of this report. In addition, the patient participated in a breathing program involving breath-holding that increased the weekly average from 15 to 60 s. and lowered the morning average resting heart rate from 80 to 60 bpm. The patient was weaned off all medications except for Zebanex (eslicarbazepine acetate, 1,200 mg) needed for seizure control, which is taken once at 16:00 h. each day.

At the time of this report (April 2021), the patient is active with a good quality of life, except for occasional tonic-clonic seizures and no signs of increased intracranial pressure. The patient was a speaker at the September 2018 Childhood and TYA Cancer Conference (http://www.childhoodcancer2018.org.uk/programme.asp; Children with Cancer; London, UK).

19,results0," The tumor continued to grow slowly without expected vasogenic edema until 2017, when the patient opted for surgical debulking. The enhancing area, centered in the inferior frontal gyrus, was surgically excised. The pathology specimen confirmed IDH1-mutant glioblastoma (GBM). Following surgery, the patient continued with a self-administered ketogenic diet to maintain low Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) values, indicative of therapeutic ketosis. At the time of this report (May 2021), the patient remains alive with a good quality of life, except for occasional seizures. MRI continues to show slow interval progression of the tumor.

20,results1," The long-term survival of this patient, now at 80 months, could be due in part to a therapeutic metabolic synergy between Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) and the IDH1 mutation that simultaneously target the glycolysis and glutaminolysis pathways that are essential for glioblastoma (GBM) growth. Further studies are needed to determine if this non-toxic therapeutic strategy could be effective in providing long-term management for other glioblastoma (GBM) patients with or without IDH mutations.  standard of care glycolysis glutaminolysis fasting mitochondrial substrate level phosphorylation (mSLP) 2-hydroxyglutarate carnivore diet ==== Body",4df2d61f-5790-4af2-9e8f-1f724ec2c970
21,discussion0," Although long-term survival is rare in patients with glioblastoma (GBM), about 5–13% of glioblastoma (GBM) patients can survive > 5 years with standard of care (SOC) for reasons that are unclear (79). This case study describes long-term survival and therapeutic management with Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) in a 32-year-old man diagnosed with a histopathologic and radiographically verified IDH1-mutant glioblastoma (GBM). Several factors could contribute to the long-term and continued survival of this patient (now at 80 months). First, the patient refused standard of care (SOC) and steroid medication. Due to his preference for non-toxic therapies and the recognized potential of Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) for glioblastoma (GBM) management, the patient opted for a self-administered KD with various supplements. This strategy, in association with the surgical debulking, could have contributed in part to the slow growth and more effective resection of his glioblastoma (GBM).",47cb6982-b1b7-48b6-87cf-eab46b7ac3dd
22,discussion1," It is well-documented that survival is longer in younger glioblastoma (GBM) patients (<50 years) than in older glioblastoma (GBM) patients (> 50 years), and that patients receiving a more complete tumor resection generally survive longer than patients receiving a subtotal resection (10, 80–82). Total or subtotal neurosurgical resection, however, is generally obtained early after diagnosis to achieve a longer survival. In contrast, this patient opted for a watch and wait strategy due to his refusal of the standard of care (SOC). Consequently, tumor debulking was performed almost 3 years after diagnosis. It is also known that median survival is longer in glioblastoma (GBM) patients that express the IDH1 (R132H) mutation (31 months) than in patients that express the wild type allele (15 months) (13, 83).",d2d915a7-8e08-4f9e-8746-fe13f05a3534
23,discussion2," While we recognize that the therapeutic response seen in this patient might not be seen in other similarly-treated glioblastoma (GBM) patients, there are decades of compelling science supporting the mechanisms by which this metabolic therapy could reduce progression of glioblastoma (GBM) (17).  The remarkably slow growth of the patient's tumor stands in contrast to previous studies on the MRI growth dynamics of untreated glioblastomas (82). Analysis of 106 untreated glioblastoma (GBM)s showed a median volume of 17.7 mL at the diagnostic MRI scan, and 27.5 mL at the preoperative scan with an estimated volume doubling time of 49.6 days. Moreover, volume doubling time was significantly faster for smaller tumors at diagnosis (<3.88 mL) than for larger tumors (> 39.88 mL). Previous studies also showed that surgical resection did not significantly increase survival in patients with small tumors no matter what percentage of the tumor could be debulked (84).",bb1d5b64-f751-4cfe-ad6e-0021b0dfb096
24,discussion3," glioblastoma (GBM) survival time was estimated at 292 days following immediate surgical resection and 492 days if the first surgical resection debulked 80% of the tumor (84). We used the ABC/2 formula to measure the volume change in the patient's tumor over time (85). The patient's tumor measured 1.25 mL at diagnosis (August, 2014) and grew to 5.97 mL at the time of the preoperative scan (April 2017), a 32-month time interval (Figure 5). The estimated volume doubling time for the patient's tumor was 432 days and his survival time, after resection, is now over 1,400 days. Clearly, the enhancing tumor growth rate and overall survival of this patient is markedly better than those of most previously reported cases. The patient's tumor is consistent with IDH1 mutant glioblastoma (GBM) with a mass-like morphology > 33% of non-contrast enhancing tumor (nCET), as previously described (86).",47bb9bc2-5c1b-44e4-9431-4d415af172c5
25,discussion4," It is not likely that loss of the ATRX protein or absent MGMT methylation could have contributed to the patient's survival in light of previous information linking these markers to poor survival (87). Could the patient's chosen Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) and the chance acquisition of the IDH1 mutation have contributed to his long-term survival with glioblastoma (GBM)?  Figure 5 Predicted and observed tumor volume for untreated IDH1-mutant glioblastoma (GBM). Measured growth of the patient's tumor compared to its estimated growth, based on the stochastic model of untreated human glioblastomas (84). The size of the tumor, measured at diagnosis in August 2014, is calculated by measuring the post contrast images only, since the current literature does not provide growth models based on the total volume of the tumor represented by the enhancing and non-enhancing tumor.",f3b5c004-d127-4477-babf-1653a8d5f6e1
26,discussion5," Based on this stochastic model, the predicted growth rate (blue dashed line), shows that the enhancing tumor would have reached a volume incompatible with life around April 2015. In striking contrast to what was expected, the patient's IDH1 mutant glioblastoma (GBM), treated with the Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) alone, demonstrated a much lower growth rate (green dashed line). It should be noted that over 70% of the patient's glioblastoma (GBM) did not enhance as would expected for IDH mutation. The patient's tumor volume measurements were determined from MRI, as described in text.  It is well-known that glioblastoma (GBM) survival and tumor growth is linked directly to blood glucose levels, i.e., high blood glucose is associated with faster disease progression and shorter survival times (18, 41, 88–97). Glucose is the fuel for aerobic fermentation (Warburg-effect), which is a driver of most malignant cancers including glioblastoma (GBM) (26, 98).",8135bad4-ee53-4f0c-9c79-f24db280a718
27,discussion6," Although the patient did not keep a food diary, he was able to maintain low Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) values with intermittent fasting and his chosen low-carbohydrate food choices. The patient's ability to maintain his Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) values consistently near 2.0 and below would target the Warburg-effect thus inhibiting growth of his tumor and improving his overall survival (99). Reduced blood glucose levels will not only starve the tumor of growth metabolites through glycolysis and one-carbon metabolism, but will also down-regulate the PI3K/Akt/Hif1-1α/mTOR signaling cascades that would further inhibit dysregulated tumor cell growth (17, 58, 100–103). The low Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) values were also in the direction of predicted therapeutic success for reducing lactic acid production (17, 56, 58, 77).",b9f0ebde-a5df-41cc-9b99-19d2c4b9eac1
28,discussion7," Reduced glucose-driven lactic acid would reduce NF-kappa-β-induced inflammation and edema in the tumor microenvironment, thus reducing tumor cell angiogenesis and invasion (17, 58, 70–72, 77, 102, 104). Reduced inflammation in the tumor microenvironment could account in part for the absence of robust vasogenic edema and the slower growth of the glioblastoma (GBM) seen in our patient, as we observed previously in Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT)-treated unirradiated preclinical glioblastoma (GBM) (75). It is also important to mention that the survival of our patient was much longer than that of most other glioblastoma (GBM) patients receiving Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) following standard of care (SOC) (45, 54, 59, 105–108). Few of the adult patients treated with Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) in these studies, however, were able to reach or maintain the Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) values predicted to have the greatest therapeutic benefit for managing glioblastoma (GBM) (77).",b2d06cbd-4af3-4a24-a85c-12dd69cb22cd
29,discussion8," The avoidance of radiotherapy would also prevent liquefactive necrosis, vascular hyalinization, and rapid tumor progression, as occurred in our previous Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT)-treated glioblastoma (GBM) patient that was of similar age at diagnosis (17, 56). The patient's decision to use Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) as an alternative to standard of care (SOC) and his ability to maintain low Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) values could have contributed in part to his long-term survival and accompanying good quality of life.  The potential mechanism by which the IDH1 mutation might reduce glioblastoma (GBM) growth and increase survival is discussed below and in Figure 6. We recently described how chemical energy by itself is the central issue for neoplastic cell viability. Tumors cannot grow without ATP, regardless of their cellular or genetic heterogeneity (26).",4e0cda8e-a5ea-40dc-bf07-b0d8d455b42e
30,discussion9," In addition to glucose, glutamine is the other major fermentable fuel that can drive ATP synthesis in most cancers including glioblastoma (GBM) (24, 26, 114). Glutamine is the only amino acid that can generate ATP synthesis through mSLP in the glutaminolysis pathway (25). While Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) might not be as effective in targeting glutaminolysis as it is in targeting glycolysis, elevation of the patient's blood ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), evident from his low Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) values, could indirectly target the glutamine-driven glutaminolysis pathway; also known as the Q-effect (25, 26). ATP synthesis through mitochondrial substrate-level phosphorylation (mSLP) at the succinate CoA ligase reaction (succinate CoA ligase reaction (SUCL)) in the glutaminolysis pathway can compensate for diminished ATP synthesis through both glycolysis and OxPhos (Figure 6).",5a9b4abe-99c0-44f6-be17-8913c1a0343f
31,discussion10," The synthesis of acetoacetyl-CoA from acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate would siphon off some of the CoA needed for the synthesis of succinyl-CoA thus reducing substrate for ATP synthesis through mSLP (26). Additionally, a reduction in α-ketoglutarate levels through action of the IDH1-induced increase in 2-hydroxyglutarate could further reduce substrate for ATP synthesis through mSLP (25, 26, 112, 115). Recent studies also show that IDH1-derived 2-hydroxyglutarate can facilitate degradation of Hif1-α and thus reduce the Warburg-effect through down-regulation of multiple genes in the glycolytic pathway (113). Further evidence of an inhibitory effect of the IDH1 mutation on glucose consumption and glycolysis was obtained recently from PET analysis (116). The long-term survival of the patient could therefore result in part from a synergistic interaction between his self-directed Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) and the anti-cancer effects of the IDH1-R132H mutation.",6a5857b4-690c-4675-a9c9-829275d8a4ed
32,discussion11,"  Figure 6 Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT)/IDH1 synergistic interaction for targeting glioblastoma (GBM) energy metabolism. Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) can reduce glucose availability for glycolysis while also interfering with the glutaminolysis pathway. Glutamine-driven mitochondrial substrate-level phosphorylation (mSLP), in the glutaminolysis pathway, is a major source of ATP synthesis for glioblastoma (GBM) cells (25, 26). The glutaminolysis pathway (red) becomes dominant in tumor cells with inefficient OxPhos and that express the dimeric PKM2 isoform. PKM2 is expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and produces less ATP through glycolysis than does the PKM1 isoform (109–111). The elevation of ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) through Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) could indirectly reduce ATP synthesis through the succinate CoA ligase (succinate CoA ligase reaction (SUCL)) reaction by diverting CoA from succinate to acetoacetate.",a189a168-3d6f-40b6-968f-d530974b9625
33,discussion12," The IDH1 mutation could further reduce ATP synthesis through mSLP by increasing synthesis of 2-hydroxyglutarate from α-ketoglutarate and thus reducing the succinyl CoA substrate for the succinate CoA ligase reaction (SUCL) reaction (26, 112). Besides its potential effect in reducing glutaminolysis, 2-hydroxyglutarate can also target multiple HIF1α-responsive genes and enzymes in the glycolysis pathway thus limiting synthesis of metabolites and one-carbon metabolism needed for rapid tumor growth (25, 26, 103, 113). The down-regulation of Hif1-α-regulated lactate dehydrogenase A (lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)), through the action of both Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) and the IDH1 mutation, would reduce extracellular lactate levels thus reducing microenvironment inflammation and tumor cell invasion.",2256e52e-160f-4169-b179-419bb3f36684
34,discussion13," Hence, the simultaneous inhibition of glycolysis and glutaminolysis through the synergistic effects of Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) and the IDH1 mutation will stress the majority of signaling pathways necessary for rapid glioblastoma (GBM) growth.

35,discussion14,"  If a capability is truly important for the biology of tumors, then its inhibition should be considered as a therapeutic strategy for effective management (99, 117). The capability in this case is the fermentation metabolism needed for the synthesis of growth metabolites and ATP through the glycolytic and glutaminolysis pathways (26). As glioblastoma (GBM) “stem cells” are more dependent on glucose than on glutamine for growth, whereas glioblastoma (GBM) “mesenchymal cells” are more dependent on glutamine than on glucose, it becomes essential to inhibit both the glycolysis and the glutaminolysis pathways simultaneously to achieve maximal glioblastoma (GBM) management (24, 75). The glutamine-addicted glioblastoma (GBM) mesenchymal cells arise from neoplastic microglia/macrophages (118, 119). A recent study showed that expression of the macrophage/microglial marker, CD163, was lower in an IDH1-mutant glioblastoma (GBM) than in IDH1 wild-type glioblastoma (GBM) (120).",97a28a9a-2389-4a95-8e03-aaa9984f1994
36,discussion15," CD163 is a biomarker for glutamine-dependent neoplastic macrophages in tumor tissue (119, 121). Hence, a synergistic interaction between the effects of the IDH1 mutation and Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) could simultaneously down-regulate both the Warburg-effect and the Q-effect in the glioblastoma (GBM) neoplastic cell populations thus providing a novel mechanism contributing to the long-term survival of our patient.  Although N-of-one single subject studies have been considered the ultimate strategy for individualizing medicine (122), we cannot predict if the therapeutic response to Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) seen in our glioblastoma (GBM) patient will also be seen in other similarly treated glioblastoma (GBM) patients, especially those with tumors that are wild-type at the IDH1 locus.",cb91a79b-3e39-4398-9d3a-8f7fafafc64b
37,discussion16," For those glioblastoma (GBM) patients not fortunate enough to have acquired the spontaneous IDH1 mutation in their tumor, glutamine targeting drugs used with Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) will be necessary to reduce tumor growth. Our recent bench-to-bedside translational studies show that simultaneous targeting of glucose and glutamine availability, using Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) and the pan-glutaminase inhibitor, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)), can significantly prolong survival in preclinical syngeneic glioblastomas (75). It is also important to note that ketogenic diets can facilitate delivery of small-molecule therapeutic drugs through the blood brain barrier without toxicity (75, 123, 124). As glioblastoma (GBM), like most malignant cancers, is dependent on fermentation for ATP synthesis and survival, the simultaneous restriction of fermentable fuels, i.e.",4f2191ca-7811-413d-b66e-1280bab237a7
38,discussion17,", glucose and glutamine, while elevating non-fermentable ketone bodies, offers a non-toxic therapeutic strategy for managing glioblastoma (GBM). Further studies will be needed to test this hypothesis in other patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM).
