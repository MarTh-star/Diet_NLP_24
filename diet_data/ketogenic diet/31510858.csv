0,background0,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)) deficiency, first described in 1970 by Blass et al. [1], is an inborn error of mitochondrial energy metabolism. The pyruvate oxidation route, that bridges the cytosolic glycolytic pathway and the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle [2], involves not only pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) but also pyruvate transport and the ancillary metabolic routes associated with various cofactors. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which irreversibly decarboxylates pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A, comprises three functional (E1 or pyruvate dehydrogenase, E2 or dihydrolipoamide transacetylase, and E3 or dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase) and one structural (E3BP or E3 binding protein, formerly designated by protein X) components, and the regulatory pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) kinases and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) phosphatases, which control the complex activity via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation [3].",9154d917-333f-4e28-bb8d-b20888f8324c
1,background1," The E1 subunit catalyzes the first, rate-limiting and irreversible step of the reaction which takes place in two active sites formed at the interface between their two α and two β subunits, each requiring a thiamine pyrophosphate cofactor and magnesium ions for activity [4, 5].  The great majority (≈ 77%) of patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency harbor mutations in the X-linked PDHA1 gene which encodes the E1α subunit. Hemizygous males are usually symptomatic whereas heterozygous females present variable expression due to random patterns of X-inactivation in different tissues, the clinical manifestations depending on the proportion of cells expressing the mutant E1α subunit. The remaining cases are caused by mutations in the genes encoding the remaining subunits: PDHB encoding E1β (4.3%), DLAT encoding E2 (1.5%), DLD encoding E3 (6.2%) and PDHX encoding E3BP (10.7%) [6].",19c5913f-b64e-43bb-982f-1d7909c71bb7
2,background2,"  The clinical presentation is extremely heterogeneous, ranging from a fatal lactic acidosis and progressive neurological and neuromuscular degradation in the neonatal period to a chronic neurological dysfunction and neurodegenerative condition. Inadequate removal of lactate but mainly of pyruvate [7] results in lactic acidemia which, together with the blood lactate/pyruvate ratio ≤ 20, is recognized as an important biomarker [8, 9]. The primary phenotypic manifestation corresponds to an impairment of neurological and/or developmental functions, leading to a wide range of symptoms and clinical features: hypotonia, seizures, ataxia, respiratory distress (like apnea and hypoventilation), facial dysmorphism, and peripheral neuropathy. Structural and functional brain abnormalities are also described, including ventriculomegaly and Leigh syndrome. According to their severity, the phenotypes can be divided into three main categories: neonatal, infantile and benign [10–12].",426a84bf-d992-46dd-8e57-e3bcbd6e9649
3,background3,"  The therapeutic strategies target: (i) the metabolic pathway, bypassing energy production via a ketogenic diet [11, 13], (ii) the regulatory system of the dysfunctional pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), using xenobiotic inhibitors [14, 15], or (iii) stimulation of the residual pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity with supplementation of cofactors [16, 17]. Nevertheless, none of these treatments is sufficiently effective and the responsiveness is markedly individual. Thus, the precise diagnosis, including the identification of the genetic defect and the phenotypic consequences, is becoming increasingly decisive for selecting the appropriate therapeutic strategy. Knowledge on the functional and structural impact of the identified mutations on the resulting pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) component variant provides relevant information for informed decisions on the therapeutic approaches.",eaa338a7-f52b-48b7-a59f-d8318f832717

14,results0,"General information The broad phenotypic spectrum of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency, common to many other genetic mitochondrial disorders, often hampers the achievement of a rapid diagnosis. Patients were suspected to be pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficient based on clinical signs /symptoms and biochemical data, namely elevated plasma lactate (L) and pyruvate (P) levels with low L/P ratio and/or impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity, but only those with genetic confirmation were considered in this study. Thus, a total of 13 individuals, all of European ancestry, were diagnosed (Table 1). The prevalence of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency in Portugal is therefore estimated to be 1/790,000, comparable to the prevalence of 1/1,000,000 reported by Orphanet, the portal of rare diseases and orphan drugs, and also to the values calculated for the French population (1/827,000 – 1/1,135,000) [8, 18].",bcfd7dbf-2019-4f7c-8e73-918066a3a025

Genetic findings In this cohort of 13 patients it was shown that patients carried mutations in three different genes: seven in the PDHA1 gene, five in the PDHX gene, and one in the DLD gene (Table 1). The mutational spectrum revealed ten different mutations: five in PDHA1, three in PDHX and two in DLD.  As expected for an X-linked disorder, most patients with mutations in PDHA1, are males (6/7) in families with no consanguinity, but it is interesting to notice that in all these patients mutations arrived by a de novo mechanism, confirmed by parental sequencing, and that mosaicism was absent. On the other hand, most patients with mutations in PDHX, displaying an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, are females (4/5) and consanguinity was detected in three cases.",e8adbe38-87e5-4536-b335-299bd18bc977
19,results7," Finally, the single patient with mutations in DLD, also displaying an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, is a compound heterozygous female with no consanguinity reported in her family.  In this patient cohort, all five different PDHA1 mutations are missense (c.615C>G, c.757A>G, c.905G>A, c.1132C>T, and c.1133G>A), generating respectively the p.F205L, p.R253G, p.R302H, p.R378C and p.R378H E1α variants. The prevalence of missense mutations, in principle the less severe mutation type, strongly correlates with the majority of patients being males. On the contrary, the three mutations detected in PDHX gene (c.160+1G>A, c.483delC and c.850C>T), being nonsense (p.R284X) and frameshift (p.G26Vfs*7 and p.P161Pfs*17), usually result in absent protein, hence their highly deleterious consequences. Three out of the five patients are homozygous for the p.R284X variant, whereas one of the remaining patients is a compound heterozygote expressing the p.R284X and p.",03f83054-d343-4f6e-9936-e641c66eb640
20,results8,"P161Pfs*17 variants, while the other is homozygous for the mutation generating the p.G26Vfs*7 variant. Regarding the two identified DLD mutations, both c.259C>T and c.803_804delAG are novel (Exome Variant, LOVD or ClinVar). The c.259C>T mutation generates the E3 p.P87S variant. Moreover, c.803_804delAG, originating a frameshift variant (p.Q268Rfs*3), is predicted to be very severe.  Biochemical findings All patients, regardless of the carried mutation, were suspected of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency due to their elevated plasma lactate and pyruvate levels: lactate ranging from 3.0 to 17.0 mmol·L−1 (median value 6.6 ± 3.9) and pyruvate from 0.27 to 0.81 mmol·L−1 (median value 0.398 ± 0.086). Lactate/pyruvate ratios as expected, with a single exception, were ≤ 16, i.e., in the normal range. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency was confirmed by determination of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity.",9064b76f-2300-42a8-98a9-fbbfc7d605cd
21,results9," Enzymatic assays were performed either in circulating lymphocytes (12 patients) or cultured fibroblasts (two patients), both tissues having been analyzed in patient 11. All patients had their enzymatic activities confirmed in a second independent sample and the results always matched. Interestingly, a single false negative result was found in the lymphocytes of a female patient later identified with a PDHA1 mutation. In our experience, the cut-off value for considering a primary pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency should be ≤ 30% of control activity and, indeed, all patients but one presented enzymatic activities ranging from 8.5% to 30% (median value 28.0 ± 7.9). The single exception was one of the siblings carrying the p.R378C variant in PDHA1, who presented 40% of normal control activity (Table 1), surprisingly the one whose symptoms manifested earliest in the neonatal period.",b9e2937c-3fb0-4954-ab92-d75b88a7ac18
22,results10,"  However, when stratifying the values of enzyme activity according to the affected pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) subunit, we observed some differences. Patients carrying PDHX mutations displayed higher and more similar values of relative activity (median value 29 ± 3.4%), whereas patients carrying PDHA1 mutations displayed a wider range of activity (median value 23.5 ± 10.7%), with half of them below 20%.  Clinical features The clinical features observed in these patients’ cohort are displayed in Table 1 and, according to the most recently published data [6], can be roughly divided into two categories: one caused by PDHA1 and PDHX mutations, and the other caused by DLD mutations. Indeed, the clinical phenotypes manifested by patients carrying PDHA1 and PDHX mutations are quite variable and almost undistinguishable.  Concerning neurological features, all individuals presented development delay/psychomotor retardation, which ranged from severe (eight patients: 61.",7aab3306-bfc2-494c-9aeb-be369cc2da99
23,results11,"5%) to moderate (four patients: 30.8%) or very mild (one patient who attended normal school: 7.7%). Hypotonia was also observed in all individuals, with a single exception (Patient 11) who nevertheless could display it at an earlier age. Seizures were reported in half the individuals, especially those carrying PDHA1 mutations (5/7 patients: 71%). On the other hand, ocular manifestations were more frequent in individuals harboring PDHX mutations (4/5 patients: 80%). Microcephaly, dystonia and ataxia were also reported in half the patients of both these gene defects. As expected, facial dysmorphism was only detected in a single female patient carrying a PDHA1 mutation. The patient with DLD deficiency revealed moderate developmental delay/psychomotor retardation, seizures, hypotonia, dystonia and ataxia. Basal ganglia abnormalities were exclusively observed in patients carrying mutations in PDHA1.",a43da3c0-e114-461d-bf4b-f12e19b1f27a

Three patients with PDHA1 mutations (3/7: 43%) and three with PDHX mutations (3/5: 60%) are under ketogenic diet with clearly beneficial effects on childhood-onset epilepsy or paroxysmal dystonia. The rationale for the ketogenic diet is that ketone bodies generated by fatty acid oxidation serve as an alternative energy substrate to glucose as the glycolytic end product, pyruvate, is not optimally metabolized. The long-term thiamine supplementation, as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) cofactor, is prescribed in almost all patients (11/13), and antiepileptic drugs only in those presenting seizures (Table 1).",05713fda-f035-4a21-9aa6-d30798c1c1d1
26,results14," Finally, it is interesting to mention that three of the patients carrying mutations in the PDHA1 gene were under arginine aspartate supplementation, with beneficial effects at the physical and intellectual levels, especially Patient 2.  In silico analysis of missense mutations Bioinformatic analysis using the PolyPhen-2 server [19] suggested that all mutations but one affecting E1α subunit are most probably damaging. The E1α p.R302H, p.R378C and p.R378H variants displayed a score of 1.000 (sensitivity 0.00 and specificity 1.00), p.F205L displayed a score of 0.919 (sensitivity 0.81 and specificity 0.94), and p.R253G displayed a score of 0.007 (sensitivity 0.96 and specificity 0.75) thus being considered benign. As for E3 subunit, the p.P87S variant is predicted to be most probably damaging, with a score of 0.996 (sensitivity 0.55 and specificity 0.98).",3a62aab8-74dd-4be8-a9fb-4da9769b7cdd
27,results15,"  To complement the information of the PolyPhen-2 server, which solely bases its predictions on the polypeptide sequence and overlooks other structural and functional details, such as e.g. cofactor binding and interaction with other proteins, we obtained and thoroughly inspected structural models of each E1α variant. The models obtained for the E1α p.R253G, p.R378C, p.R378H and p.F205L variants have been recently described by our group, attempting to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of the corresponding mutations [20]. All mutations result in putative loss of H-bonds, electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions between the side chains of the substituted amino acids and neighboring residues, with predicted effects on P-loop destabilization, inter-subunit interactions and proper oligomeric assembly, as well as interaction with other pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) components. Herein, we additionally generated a structural model of the E1α p.",5fb9fe4f-4cbf-453f-96f9-7d7edf95c2f4
28,results16,"R302H variant (Fig. 3). R302 is located at one end of the P-loop A, its side chain being within electrostatic and H-bonding distance to the side chain or main chain carbonyl moieties of Y287, R288, Y289, H290 (active site residue) and G298, all residues belonging to the same P-loop. Upon substitution by a histidine residue, most of the possible interactions between its side chain and other residues in the P-loop are lost. The single remaining H bond is that between the side chain imidazole and the main chain carbonyl of G298. Therefore, in the p.R302H E1α variant, the net loss of four possible side chain interactions with other P-loop A residues (Fig. 3) is likely to contribute to a more disordered loop and consequently lower enzymatic activity. Notably, the degree of disorder in P-loop A has been negatively correlated with E1 enzymatic activity, since an ordered loop favors TPP binding, which itself promotes P-loop A order [21].Fig.",b2d5b1a0-c985-4f54-94b2-1131718aaefa

As observed in Fig. 4, P87 is located in a helix that lines with the flavin adenine dinucleotide isoalloxazine ring and contains the active site disulfide composed of C45 and C50. Substitution of P87 by a serine is likely to alter the flexibility and thus the overall stability of the respective helix, possibly affecting the enzymatic activity.Fig. 4 In silico analysis of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E3 p.P87S variant.

33,discussion0,"The diagnosis of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency is extremely challenging due to a phenotypic presentation that can be observed in many other neurological disorders, especially those causing abnormal mitochondrial metabolism [6, 23, 24]. Indeed, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency can be included in the vaster group of pyruvate oxidation defects (pyruvate oxidation defects (POD)) which also involves defects in genes coding for proteins participating in the whole pyruvate oxidation route, including cofactors, regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier [6]. Nevertheless, in this study, we only included patients carrying mutations in the genes encoding the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) subunits (PDHA1, PDHB, PDHX, DLAT and DLD).",5de85743-aa9f-455f-adbf-180385d28bad
34,discussion1," Accordingly, and comparing the prevalence rate we obtained versus the previously reported prevalence (respectively 1:790,000 and 1:1,000,000) we may assume that no significant number of patients were missed.  In such context, we aimed to present the first report on a cohort of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficient Portuguese patients combining information on the associated clinical, biochemical, enzymatic and genotypic spectra. The mutational spectrum of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency in this group of patients revealed ten different mutations affecting three genes, PDHA1 (five), PDHX (three) and DLD (two). Concerning the prevalence of the deficiency of each gene, these data generally agree with literature surveys [6, 9] and also with several studies focused on different populations [8, 25, 26].",5f26d10a-f8c9-4804-8af8-8e01d5377dc4
35,discussion2," However, the frequency of mutations in the PDHA1 gene is lower than the usually reported average of 75–80%, due to a high number of patients harboring mutations in the PDHX gene (38% in our cohort versus 10% in the literature).  The most striking evidence is the relatively high incidence of E3BP deficiency, mostly caused by a p.R284X E3BP variant, half the cases originating from the Azores Islands, thus denoting a founder effect. This E3BP variant was first described by our group [27] and, until now, only another Portuguese patient has been reported to carry this mutation [28]. Furthermore, the mutational spectrum of E3BP deficiency in Portugal includes very severe mutations, leading to null alleles. Nevertheless, our older patients surprisingly reached adulthood, in line with the high proportion of long-term survival among reported E3BP deficient patients [8, 29, 30].",4644d6fe-b396-4bd4-8126-7db7366e9edb
36,discussion3," In general, an overwhelming majority of the mutations hitherto identified in the PDHX gene are, as in this work, deletions, nonsense mutations, point mutations at intron–exon boundaries, or even large intra-genic rearrangements, expected to result in a complete absence of E3BP protein [8, 30–32]. Despite this fact, the patients retain considerably significant pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity (20–30%), considering the expected impairment on pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) assembly. On the one hand, as a structural subunit devoid of enzymatic activity, E3BP does not directly contribute to the complex catalytic activity. On the other hand, the significantly truncated E3BP, if present at all in the cell, would likely compromise the structure of the E2/E3BP pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) core and binding of the E3 component. Both E2 and E3BP components have a similar structure and domain organization, despite only E2 being catalytically active [33].",e7995f8e-9a18-4d32-8516-16eddc0dd426
37,discussion4," However, the possibility of the E2 core directly binding to the E3 enzyme may underlie the observed residual pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity [30–32, 34]. In their recent work, Prajapati and collaborators report a non-uniform stoichiometry of the E2/E3BP pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) core. The imbalanced distribution of E2 and E3BP constituents of the trimeric units results into structurally dynamic E1 and E3 clusters [35]. Moreover, for one of the proposed models of E. coli, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) core is a fully functional E2 homotrimer operating in a “division-of-labor” mechanism, including binding of the E3 component [35, 36].  Concerning the mutational spectrum of E1α deficiency, five different PDHA1 mutations were identified, all but a single one (c.1132C>T, encoding the p.R378C variant) from non-consanguineous patients.",a89e23ca-73bc-4041-b6c9-380fba81e7ea
38,discussion5," Almost all mutations affect an arginine codon [37] and those located in exons 10 and 11 cause a severe phenotype, because the resulting protein variants present very low enzyme activity. On the contrary, the two mutations located in exon 7 originate moderate (c.615C>G, encoding the p.F205L variant) or very mild (c.757A>G, encoding the p.R253G variant) phenotypes. Interestingly, mutations affecting codon 378 are considered particularly lethal [9]. Indeed, from our male patients carrying the p.R378C mutation, one deceased at three years of age and the twins, presently aged 8 years, display a severe clinical picture. However, a female patient bearing the p.R378H substitution reached the adulthood, probably due to a lyonization effect.  Regarding a possible genotype-dependent phenotypic presentation, our data is roughly suggestive of such a correlation. Effectively, the patients harboring the most deleterious mutations (c.905G>A and c.",b5269c1c-f96f-4f76-b63d-2306d4cc8cc3
39,discussion6,"1132C>T in PDHA1 and all the mutations in PDHX) present the most severe phenotypes, involving serious psychomotor retardation, hypotonia and seizures, whereas those carrying less severe mutations accordingly display a better clinical outcome. The most puzzling observation concerns the female carrying mutations in DLD. Despite being a compound heterozygote bearing two severe mutations, her clinical course was reasonable until 2018 when she suffered an acute metabolic decompensation originating spastic tetraparesis with gait and language loss. Although she partially recovered language, she currently presents a moderate-to-severe psychomotor handicap. Despite the E3 subunit being common to other enzyme complexes such as α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and branched-chain amino acid dehydrogenase, this patient did not display the associated biochemical or clinical phenotypes.",37569d10-d291-469b-b07a-a38e81757a77
40,discussion7,"  Irrespectively of our patients’ cohort size, the majority of our pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficient patients remarkably reached adulthood, as opposed to several other reports [9, 18, 25, 26]. Concerning the therapeutic measures to which these individuals are subjected, it is clear they are only palliative, since all patients but one continue presenting clinical features ranging from moderate to severe forms. The single exception is Patient 2 who seems to represent an exceptional case, because his treatment only encompasses thiamine (E1 subunit cofactor) and arginine aspartate supplementation [38]. Arginine aspartate (Asparten®, Sargenor®) is an anti-asthenic over-the-counter medicine. Aspartate is considered an anaplerotic agent, whereas arginine has the ability to suppress aggregation during protein folding by binding to the folding intermediates through weak interactions, thus being considered a putative chemical chaperone [39–41]. This patient carries the PDHA1 c.",ccec73a8-ce64-4296-ba53-270e653d684e

The same impairment on the affinity for TPP was observed in various PDHA1 missense mutations [20]. Thiamine supplementation is thus likely to ameliorate the functional impact in terms of TPP affinity for several of these variants [20]. Nevertheless, our observation of the serious regress of the clinical symptoms, while the arginine aspartate uptake was interrupted in Patient 2 [38], suggests that this patient benefits from both arginine aspartate and thiamine treatments.",893e1fa7-0cf0-41a2-aea6-615900b104de
42,discussion9,"  In conclusion, the identification of the disease-causing mutations, together with the functional and structural characterization of the respective protein variants, allows getting insight on the severity of the clinical phenotype and the selection of the most appropriate therapy, namely the option for a ketogenic diet.
