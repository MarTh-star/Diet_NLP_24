Cells were treated with decanoic acid (60 μM), octanoic acid (60 μM), or DMSO control for 22 or 2 h to provide final treatment durations of 24 and 4 h. Autophagy inducer AR-12 (Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA, OSU-03012), or DMSO control, was added, and shaking was continued for 1 h before addition of protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland, 11873580001) at a final concentration of 2.5-fold or HL5 control.

Decanoic Acid Induces Autophagosome Formation  We initially investigated a role for decanoic acid and octanoic acid in the induction of an autophagic response in Dictyostelium.",eecd7d50-b06d-4231-b85f-f563f2aeb90e
8,methods8," In these experiments, the incorporation of the autophagosome-associated Atg8 protein, linked to a fluorescent marker, was monitored, where GFP-Atg8-labeled autophagosome can be rapidly assessed (Figure 1A). To validate this approach, we initially quantified the number of GFP-Atg8-positive structures under control (growth) conditions and following starvation (1 h), where autophagy is induced. The number of GFP-Atg8-positive structures increased from an average of 2.6 autophagosomes per cell to an average of 7.3 autophagosomes per cell following starvation (p ≤ 0.01) (Figure 1B,C). This increase in autophagosome number was independent of changes in autophagosome size (Figure 1B,D). Starvation-induced autophagosome number increase is therefore consistent with an induction of autophagy [45].  We then investigated the effects of decanoic acid and octanoic acid on inducing autophagy in Dictyostelium during growth, in high glucose conditions.",09738161-4996-40d1-80f3-eda38d98085c
9,methods9," To do this, we quantified the average number of GFP-Atg8 structures following acute (4 h) or chronic (24 h) treatment with these fatty acids or with an autophagy inducer or a protease inhibitor. In these experiments, we chose a concentration of decanoic acid (60 µM) that reduces mTORC1 activity [49] during growth to show a significantly increased number of GFP-Atg8 positive structures, from an average of 2.78 autophagosomes per cell to 5.49 autophagosomes per cell after 4 h (p < 0.001) and 5.96 autophagosomes per cell following 24 h (p < 0.001) (Figure 1E,F). Treatment with octanoic acid (also at 60 µM) did not increase the number of GFP-Atg8 positive structures at either time point (Figure 1E,F). Treatment with the autophagy inducer (AR-12, 2.5 µM) increased the average number of GFP-Atg8-containing structures to 6.32 autophagosomes per cell (p < 0.001) (Figure 1E,F). Protease inhibitors also elevated the number of GFP-Atg8-containing structures (Figure 1E,F).",0422f003-9c1a-4679-81ee-d2cdd07cfd07
10,methods10," None of the treatment conditions changed the size of GFP-Atg8-containing structures (Figure 1E,G). Our data suggest that the increase in autophagosomes observed following treatment with decanoic acid is consistent with a structurally specific induction of autophagy in the absence of starvation.  3.2. Decanoic Acids Enhances Autophagic Flux  Since our data suggest that decanoic acid treatment induces the formation of autophagosomes, consistent with the activation of autophagy, we continued by analyzing the effect of decanoic and octanoic acid on autophagic flux. This assay involves observing the autophagy-dependent cleavage of GFP-Atg8 present in autophagosomes, to form GFP, and the subsequent degradation of GFP. Autophagic flux can be activated by the addition of autophagy inducers to enhance both the cleavage of GFP-Atg8 and the breakdown of free GFP, or blocked by the presence of protease inhibitors [32].",88b0a161-a522-4854-8403-10fe9a6846b4
11,methods11,"  The effects of decanoic acid and octanoic acid on autophagic flux was analyzed in Dictyostelium through the measurement of free GFP and GFP-Atg8 levels following acute (4 h) or chronic (24 h) treatment. In these experiments, cells were treated with decanoic acid or octanoic acid (60 µM), or with an autophagy inducer (AR-12, 2.5 µM) or a protease inhibitor [32] (Figure 2). In this analysis, acute (4 h) and chronic decanoic acid (24 h) reduced both free GFP and GFP-Atg8 levels (Figure 2B,C), with a significant reduction in the ratio of free GFP: GFP-Atg8 (Figure 2D), consistent with the activation of autophagic flux. In comparison, acute and chronic octanoic treatment reduced free GFP levels (Figure 2B); however, the ratio of free GFP: GFP-Atg8 levels was only reduced in acute treatment (Figure 2D), suggesting a short-term transient change in autophagic flux caused by octanoic acid.",0da2feea-4662-4167-9a62-cd745625b158
12,methods12," Treatment with the autophagy inducer reduced free GFP, leading to a significant reduction in the ratio of free GFP: GFP-Atg8 (Figure 2D), indicating increased autophagic flux. Treatment with the protease inhibitor reduced free GFP levels without altering GFP-Atg8 levels consistent with a block in the initial cleavage of GFP-Atg8 leading to a reduction in the generation of free GFP [32] (Figure 2B–D). These results demonstrate that decanoic acid treatment provides a consistent increase in autophagic flux in Dictyostelium.  3.3. Decanoic Acid Does Not Reduce PIP3 Levels  To investigate a mechanism for the decanoic acid-dependent activation of autophagy, we initially focused on a key phosphoinositide, PIP3 (PtdInsP3), that plays a key role in inhibiting autophagy through the activation of mTORC1, with a well-established role in regulating autophagy [50,51].",eb9ecb9e-eab5-4ca7-9953-163e15421267
13,methods13," This pathway provided a logical choice for mechanism; since decanoic acid has been suggested to attenuate phosphoinositide signaling [18], we investigated the effects of both fatty acids on PIP3 levels in Dictyostelium. These experiments involved developing cells to an early aggregation stage and using a single pulse of cAMP (1 µM) to induce PI3K activity to produce PIP3 on the cell membrane, and measured this production using membrane localization of a fluorescent marker protein containing a pH domain linked to GFP [42,52]. In wild type cells, inducing PI3K activation provided a transient localization of the marker from the cytosol to the membrane (Figure 3A), with a peak membrane localization (equivalent to peak PIP3 production) at around 10 s post induction.",467edee5-55a8-429c-9bad-4c4fddaee4b3
14,methods14," Pretreatment of cells for 60 min with either decanoic or octanoic acid (60 µM), a concentration that induced autophagy in these cells, did not significantly reduce PIP3 production visualized by PHcrac-GFP membrane localization (Figure 3A). Quantification of this effect indicated no significant effect on the maximum (peak) PIP3 production (Figure 3B) nor the total production of PIP3 (area under the curve) (Figure 3C). Strong inhibition was demonstrated using a PI3K inhibitor, LY290064 (100 µM), confirming the specificity of this assay. These data suggest that both decanoic acid and octanoic acid are unlikely to regulate autophagy through inhibiting PIP3 production.  3.4. Decanoic Acid Provides Limited Regulation of protein kinase B (PKB) Activity  The regulation of autophagy has also been demonstrated through the evolutionarily conserved protein kinase B (protein kinase B (PKB)) [53].",237dc5cd-d3f8-4b6f-8b40-cbd0e2f070c0
15,methods15," This protein is activated following PIP3 production but also by a range of other signaling pathways independent of PI3K [54], suggesting that medium-chain fatty acids may function through protein kinase B (PKB) regulation independent of PI3K activity. Thus, to analyze the effect of decanoic acid and octanoic acid on protein kinase B (PKB) activation, we monitored the phosphorylation (activation) of protein kinase B (PKB)R1 (T309), which is dependent upon mTORC2 activity [48,55,56], and the activation of protein kinase B (PKB)A (T278), which is dependent upon both TORC2 and PIP3 [48]. Thus, western blotting using antibodies against the activation loop phosphorylation sites can be used to rapidly assess protein kinase B (PKB) activation from both TORC2 and PI3K-signalling pathways.",8b1a19f8-76c5-43d2-b5c2-3b10c4ff995a
16,methods16," Using cells in early development, consistent with the experiments for the analysis of PIP3, and inducing activation of protein kinase B (PKB)A and protein kinase B (PKB)R1 by a single pulse of cAMP (1 µM), cell samples were taken at intervals and analyzed by western blot (Figure 4). In the absence of MCFAs, peak activation occurred 10–60 s after stimulation (Figure 4A) for both protein kinase B (PKB) enzymes, and both decanoic and octanoic acid did not grossly modify activation, although inhibition of PI3K blocked protein kinase B (PKB)A activation. Quantification of the effect of decanoic acid on protein kinase B (PKB)A activation identified reduced activation at a single time point (20 s) compared to the control, with no effect of octanoic acid, with inhibition of PI3K activity providing significantly reduced induction (from 10–30 s) and total activation (area under curve) (Figure 4B).",ab41b2c2-3f6a-441a-90ae-9dc7d6ecd887
17,methods17," Quantification of protein kinase B (PKB)R1 activation also showed no effect of either decanoic acid or octanoic acid, although inhibition of PI3K activity provided a small but significant reduction of induction (from 10–20 s), with no change in total activation with any treatment (area under curve) (Figure 4C). Thus, these data suggest that decanoic acid is unlikely to regulate autophagy through the inhibition of protein kinase B (PKB) activity.  3.5. Decanoic Acid Increases Expression of Autophagy-Inducing Proteins  To understand the mechanisms leading to the decanoic acid dependent induction of autophagosome formation and increase in autophagic flux, we investigated a transcription-based effect of decanoic acid on the expression levels of two genes encoding autophagy-related proteins. We chose to analyze atg1 [57,58] and atg8a [43,59], where both encoded proteins have a role in inducing autophagy.",52fd7b84-3ae9-488a-b2cf-8990abbbca23
18,methods18," In these experiments, wild type cells were treated with decanoic acid (60 µM) and a higher concentration of octanoic acid to maximize potential changes in expression (120 µM), for 1, 4, or 24 h, and gene expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis (Figure 5). The expression of both atg1 and atg8a was not altered following 1 h decanoic acid treatment, was noticeable but not non-significantly increased after 4 h treatment, and was significantly upregulated following 24 h treatment (p ≤ 0.01 for both), consistent with a chronic induction of autophagy (Figure 5A,B) [60]. Octanoic acid treatment did not induce either atg1 or atg8a expression at any time point. Thus, we have demonstrated a structural specific effect of decanoic acid to increases the expression of autophagy-associated genes, consistent with an induction of autophagy.  3.6.",620ca8e2-2326-49d1-953b-186546342732
19,methods19," Structural Specificity of Fatty Acids on Dictyostelium Autophagy  Structural specificity of medium-chain fatty acids in seizure control has previously been demonstrated in Dictyostelium and then in mammalian models. This specificity was initially identified through the reproduction of a molecular mechanism shown for the current epilepsy treatment, Epilim (valproic acid) [18], with these compounds then demonstrated to potently block seizure activity [19,20,61]. We therefore investigate the effects of a range of other medium-chain fatty acids on autophagy induction in Dictyostelium (Figure 6A). Initially, analyzing a seven carbon backbone medium-chain fatty acid, 2MHA (Figure 6B,C), that does not show seizure control activity [19], did not provide an autophagosome induction effect similar to that of decanoic acid. Nonanoic acid, a nine-carbon-backbone straight-chain fatty acid, intermediate between decanoic acid and octanoic acid, did not show autophagy induction.",cf7cb39b-c0e8-4c2d-8562-3722aa947fca
20,methods20," In contrast, two other related compounds, 4BCCA and 4EOA, both showing strong seizure control activity [19,20,61], significantly increased autophagosome formation, as did the valproic acid (Figure 6B,C). None of the compounds altered autophagosome size (Figure 6D). These data suggest that structurally specific MCFA that show seizure control activity may function to induce autophagy.  4. Discussion  Autophagy, required for the recycling of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, is a key cellular process involved in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, where activation of the process has been suggested to provide therapeutic effects [62,63]. Here, we demonstrate that decanoic acid, provided by the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet [22], stimulates autophagy in the biomedical model Dictyostelium.",4de7895b-029a-4aba-a965-8f2e05a817cf
21,methods21," In this model [64], decanoic acid leads to an increase in the number of autophagosomes per cell and an increase in autophagic flux, likely caused by an increase in the expression of two autophagy-linked genes, atg1 and atg8a [43,57,58,59]. In contrast, octanoic acid provides no effect on autophagosome number or chronic autophagic flux and does not induce expression of autophagy genes, indicating the specificity of this effect. We thus identify that decanoic acid may induce autophagy and autophagic flux through a structurally specific effect on transcription.  Autophagy has a recognized role in epilepsy that was first established when rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, was shown to suppress seizures [1]. Subsequently, a blockage in autophagy has been identified in patients with genetic conditions giving rise to seizures, such as tuberous sclerosis complex (tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)) [65,66] and Lafora disease [4].",7889761c-a48e-4906-9fb6-d14ce39b0a9f
22,methods22," Thus, novel approaches are currently being examined to activate autophagy as a treatment for epilepsy [2,67,68]. Furthermore, the capacity of the classical ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting to increase starvation-induced autophagy has substantiated these dietary interventions as potential treatments for epilepsy [69]. Dysfunctional autophagy is also associated with the neurodegenerative disorders, Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s disease, and activating autophagy has proven successful in models of these disorders [66,70,71]. Interestingly, a new medium chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet containing enhanced levels of decanoic acid has recently been demonstrated to provide strong seizure control effects on a range of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy [72], in the absence of ketosis, suggesting a key role for decanoic acid-dependent effects.",0d42fabd-0144-4754-a89b-9b5812baf6fd
23,methods23," In addition, another new medium chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet also been shown to provide a mild increase in cognitive function in patients with early-stage Alzheimer’ disease [73,74]. Our findings suggest that further analysis of a role for decanoic acid in activating autophagy may identify therapeutic benefits in epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders.  The role of fatty acids in regulating autophagy for therapeutic effect remains poorly understood. Our findings that show a decanoic acid-dependent activation of autophagy in Dictyostelium are consistent with that shown in mouse models, where dietary medium-chain fatty acids restore suppressed autophagy [75]. In regards to long-chain fatty acids, the majority of research in this field focuses on palmitic acid (C16:0) and oleic acid (C18:1), where both these fats either inhibit autophagy [76,77,78] or activate it [77,79,80,81].",a7d9a44a-2191-4c47-88d7-28d57b8d50f4
24,methods24," Short-chain fatty acids have also been suggested to regulate autophagy [82,83] with the length of fatty acid as well as the saturation status thought to alter the effect on autophagy [78]. Thus, although a range of fatty acids have been shown to regulate autophagy, our findings now include decanoic acid in this list, with structural specificity in activating this process.  Decanoic acid has recently been demonstrated to modulate a range of cellular processes, where some of these may underlie the effect shown here for autophagy induction. Our initial focus was on decanoic acid-dependent regulation of phosphoinositide signaling, first identified in Dictyostelium [18], and particularly PIP3, since this effect was also demonstrated for Epilim using in vitro and in vivo mouse models [84].",a75b0694-a578-49cc-81cb-2ceba89bf197
25,methods25," In Dictyostelium, decanoic acid did not significantly reduce maximum or total PIP3 levels, nor reduce the total activation of protein kinase B (PKB)A (partially dependent upon PIP3) [48], although it provided a small but significant reduction in protein kinase B (PKB)A activation 20 s after stimulation. This suggests a small effect on PIP3 production but may not be enough to increase autophagy levels. However, decanoic acid has recently been shown to reduce the activation of mTORC1 in Dictyostelium, and additionally in rodent hippocampal slices and in iPSC-derived human astrocytes [49]. We propose here that the likely mechanism of decanoic acid in upregulating autophagy is due to inhibition of mTORC1, to activate transcription of autophagy inducing genes (atg1 and atg8), to activate autophagy.",bd7d612a-d7f8-4cbb-bc91-c61d6acbdd1a
26,methods26," This mechanism is consistent with the structurally specific effect of decanoic acid (not octanoic acid) in both inhibiting mTORC1 and inducing autophagy, independent of the glucose restriction and insulin signaling associated with the classical ketogenic diets [13,85,86,87]. Further analysis of genes known to be regulated by mTOR in Dictyostelium would provide additional evidence for the involvement of this pathway [88].  In this paper, we have identified that the medium-chain fatty acid, decanoic acid, activates autophagy in Dictyostelium. Since activation of autophagy has been suggested as a potential treatment for epilepsy and a range of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, we suggest that further investigation into the mechanism behind fatty-acid-induced autophagy activation could enhance our understanding of the benefits of medium-chain fatty acids in health and disease.
