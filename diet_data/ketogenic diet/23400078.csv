0,introduction0,"Numerous pathologies (Fragile X, syndromes of congenital infection, vaccinations, perinatal damage, and others) have been discussed as potential etiologies associated with autistic behavior and/or autism spectrum disorder (autism spectrum disorder (ASD)) (Mazzoko et al., 1998; Gallagher and Goodman, 2010), and an expanding literature has demonstrated more frequent associations between inborn errors of metabolisms (inborn errors of metabolism (IEM)s) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) . Recent reports have highlighted a growing association between autism spectrum disorder (ASD)s and respiratory chain abnormalities, including complex III/IV deficiency and MELAS syndrome, as well as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (Guevara-Campos et al., 2010; Chauhan et al., 2011).",db1566a2-ad0f-40c4-aa09-60b081eb5961
1,introduction1," Further, a number of reports suggest metabolic derangements in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients that are suggestive of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), such as abnormalities of glucose oxidation and utilization, among others . In these cases, however, it is difficult to conclusively identify whether the manifestation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on the background of the inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) is a primary or secondary pathology. Despite the increased number of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), recent work  suggested that a careful clinical evaluation is more crucial than systematic metabolic investigations but this aspect should be tested through a large population based prospective study assessing the benefits of routine metabolic screening in non-syndromic autistic spectrum disorders.  Greece represents a country for which a number of populations reside in relative geographic isolation.",8b1ba9cb-acfd-44f7-ac51-971c3b00dcc3
2,introduction2," This is especially true for the Greek islands, where previous studies have documented a large number of patients for whom indeterminate neurological features associate with a small number of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM)s . Many of these patients manifest features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), occasionally associated with a positive family history and/or consanguinity. In order to extend our earlier work, we examined a cohort of these patients on the island of Crete in order to ascertain the incidence of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM)s and metabolic disturbances, and the corresponding link to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The current report summarizes the results of our investigations. ",b52b05d1-9847-4782-a162-445f4fc20f57
3,methods0,"We evaluated 187 children (105 males, 82 females; ages 4–14 years) who presented with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

5,methods2," Further, patients with otorhinal or ocular abnormalities, as well as failure to thrive, were also excluded.  At admission, we recorded detailed family histories (e.g., additional affected individuals, consanguinity, repetitive miscarriages, etc.) as well as dietary habits of the patients (symptoms following ingestion of certain foods and/or prolonged fasting, tendency to dietary avoidances). All subjects underwent detailed clinical and psychiatric examination, and anthropomorphic data was obtained. Laboratory investigations included: complete blood count, blood biochemical evaluations (electrolytes, glucose, transaminases, CPK, LDH, cholesterol, triglycerides, thyroid hormones), electrocardiogram (electrocardiogram (ECG)), and electroencephalogram (EEG).",96a88ed3-f8b9-4883-aa7b-7f1d94809c2a
6,methods3," These were followed by more specific examinations, including: serum amino acids, carnitine, urine purines and pyrimidines, urine amino and organic acids, urine mucopolysaccharides and oligosaccharides, cytogenetic analysis, and glucose loading test. For the latter, blood was obtained for determination of lactic acid, pyruvate, and β-hydroxybutyric acid (b-OH-b) following an 8 h fast, after which subjects received a 10% glucose bolus (2 g/kg of body weight, maximum 50 g). Sixty minutes post glucose administration, blood was obtained for determination of the same metabolites. In selected patients, more detailed analyses included lysosomal enzymology, guanidinoacetate-n-methyltransferase (guanidinoacetate n methyltransferase (GAMT)) assay and biopsy of skeletal muscle for assessment of various mitochondrial enzymes.

7,results0,"Confirmed diagnoses We identified two patients with Lesch Nyhan syndrome, two patients with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH)) deficiency, and a single patient with phenylketonuria. Thus, confirmed diagnoses in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients for a known inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) was 2.7% of the total subject number investigated.  Biochemical abnormalities suggestive of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) For 12/187 (7%) of patients, urinary 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid (3-OH-IVA) was elevated and sera methylcitrate and lactate levels were also elevated in two of these patients. Despite these biochemical abnormalities, defects in biotinidase, or holocarboxylase synthetase  could not be demonstrated in either sera or fibroblasts. Of interest, none of these 12 patients was undergoing valproate intervention, the latter a potential source of 3-OH-IVA elevation in urine .",446b3fc2-3f38-4aed-af9b-21eadb21cd07
8,results1," Despite an absence of confirmatory enzyme deficiencies in these 12 patients, we nonetheless opted to treat empirically with biotin for 3 weeks, 2 × 10 mg and then for 6 months at 2 × 5 mg, which led to a clear therapeutic benefit in 7/13 consisting of improvement in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS); Table 2). For those benefiting from biotin intervention, the most impressive outcome centered on a 42 month-old boy whose severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was completely ameliorated following biotin intervention. This patient was subsequently followed for 5 years, and cessation of biotin intervention (or placebo replacement) resulted in the rapid return of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-like symptomatology. This patient currently attends public school without any clinical sequelae and remains on biotin at 20 mg/d.

Results of diagnostic loading studies A glucose challenge was administered to all test subjects, revealing a pathological increase in sera b-OH-b in 16/187 subjects (Table 3) and elevated sera lactate in 18/187. These results for glucose loading pointed to mitochondrial disease, although confirmatory testing could not be undertaken due to a lack of monetary support for muscle biopsy from both parents and insurers.

Pathological results for post-glucose loading test (GLT) lactate are those that exceed 30% of the pre-glucose loading test (GLT) lactate value.  We instituted a ketogenic diet (KD) in 6/16 patients who had demonstrated a pathological increase in serum b-OH-b associated with glucose loading. Although our desire was to implement the KD in all 16 patients, it is a diet particularly challenging to implement in autistic patients, and we were only successful in six cases. One of these six patients showed a remarkable improvement in Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) scale (Table 4) and subsequently medications (risperidone and hydroxyzine) were stopped. This patient is currently attending a public elementary school without clinical problems. Clinical improvements in the remaining 5/6 patients were more subtle (Table 4).",b1ae1c84-1b38-4458-9fa0-083378b55f5a

16,results10,"  Family histories, clinical findings, and dietary characteristics Twenty-two of 178 test subjects had a family history that was positive for neurological disease. Additionally, 13/178 subjects had 1st, 2nd, or 3rd degree relatives with comparable symptoms, while other family members often suffered from other chronic neurological morbidity, including epilepsy, ataxia or mild to severe developmental delay. Consanguinity was confirmed in the parents of six patients (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree relatives). Unfortunately three of these families had children with symptomatology similar to that of the proband we investigated. Twelve of 178 patients had clear evidence of facial dysmorphia, including hypertelorism and low-set ears. With regard to diet, 26/178 subjects showed evidence of dietary intolerance. Of these, 5/26 patients (who also had abnormal glucose loading results) manifested exacerbation of symptoms during high carbohydrate intake.",1e3b2950-eef1-4b16-aaed-b1a852eb7f60
17,results11," Similarly, three patients who demonstrated decreased blood ketone body production following a glucose bolus self-selected a low-fat diet, and high fat consumption correlated with deterioration in the clinical picture for one of these three, characterized by increased hyperactivity and stereotypies. Finally, 15/187 patients without biochemical abnormalities manifested food intolerance, and key clinical symptoms (hyperactivity, increased stereotypies, sleep disturbances) were exacerbated with high protein consumption.  Neuroimaging abnormalities Twenty-five of 187 subjects manifested pathological EEG findings without seizures, the most common feature being beta-rhythms. Abnormalities of the MRI were found in 12/187 subjects, featuring primarily cerebellar hypoplasia and agenesis of the corpus callosum in the absence of specific structural abnormalities.",11dd15eb-7b9d-4e14-8f8b-3e0731abf062

19,discussion0,"A complex disorder associated with multifactorial inheritance, autism (or autism spectrum disorder (ASD); also pervasive developmental delay) is comprised of multiple phenotypic features, the most prominent of which are behavioral disturbances (e.g., obsessive compulsive disorder and/or highly ritualistic behavior) and primary disturbances of social skills, the latter prominent in adolescents and adults (Stokstad, 2001; Manzi et al., 2008; Kotulska and Jóźwiak, 2011). For most patients, the primary etiology remains undefined. Conversely, in a small subset of cases there is a clear genetic etiology, primarily those of a syndromic genetic disorder, including Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis and others (Pickler and Elias, 2009; Toriello, 2012). Additionally, expanding research has revealed the presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), including phenylketonuria, disorders of mitochondrial metabolism (Weissman et al., 2008; Shoffner et al.",6802272a-fc55-4dd1-8c1f-6ba1c5229e70
20,discussion1,", 2010), defects in the metabolism of purines and pyrimidines, and disorders of cerebral glucose transport (Schaefer and Lutz, 2006; Schiff et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010). Of interest, in the rare disorder of GABA metabolism, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency, a major subset of confirmed adolescent patients suffer from extensive obsession compulsion, frequently characterized as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) .  In addition to the confirmed cases of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) that were detected in the current report (5/178 cases), our cohort analyses included indirect evidence for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) without confirmed diagnosis, including abnormal responses to glucose loading, response to KD (in the absence of clinical seizures) and responsiveness to pharmacological biotin administration.",44bb3321-dd84-4f76-be06-71ce99f32556
21,discussion2," The response to biotin in a subset of our cohort, despite an absence of defined deficiencies in biotin-dependent biotinidase or multiple carboxylase enzymes, supports earlier findings in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cohorts revealing nutritional deficiencies including biotin . From the biochemical perspective, it would seem logical to assume that biotin response and hyperexcretion of 3-OH-IVA in our cohort are correlated, most likely through biotin-dependent 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, but currently we have no clear etiology explaining the response to biotin.  To our knowledge, the existence of Lesch-Nyhan disease or succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency has not been previously detected during screening of any autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patient cohort.",819586c8-4ffc-4612-98c0-e21afc889517
22,discussion3," The rarity of both suggests that a more discrete screening for these disorders in the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) population is warranted, at the very least in the Greek population. The finding of two cases of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency within 187 cases (>1%) is consistent with the expanding phenotypic observation of OCD in these patients . The current report, therefore, may present some justification for the concept of screening for succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency in the autism and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) populations, especially in those populations in which autosomal recessive disorders are expected to have increased prevalence.  The current report represents only the second large scale evaluation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients for the presence of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM)s. Schiff et al.",2a8d2bee-7ed2-491b-a1fc-ec145a501d15
23,discussion4," (2011) broadly screened 274 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients for the presence of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), identifying two cases. These included a case of non-specific urinary creatine excretion and a patient with persistent 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, or less than 1% yield in their patient cohort. Neither Schiff's report nor ours positively identified patients with mitochondrial disease, creatine transport defects, glucose transport defect or others (e.g., glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) which have been previously documented in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients (Connolly et al., 2010; Guevara-Campos et al., 2010). This may simply reflect the ethnicity of the cohorts evaluated, including France and Greece, where incidence/prevalence of various inborn errors of metabolism (IEM)s will be quite different.",46726069-1713-487c-8dc0-d5c0f9564a57
24,discussion5," Other investigators have recommended that care be taken in considering screening for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients , and Moss and Howlin (2009) have appropriately cautioned that correlation of behavioral similarities between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and those observed in genetically-determined syndromes (e.g., Fragile X, Angelman, etc.) be carefully interpreted. Nonetheless, our report suggests that further consideration be given to the selected analysis of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients, and that those studies might benefit from the broadest coverage of ethnic and regional groups possible, especially in populations for whom recessive disorders have an increased incidence.",c6f133f5-9456-4cdc-88cc-e438e64c2f03
25,discussion6," Broad screening evaluations such as these might be justifiable in helping to identify genetic subsets of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), providing genetic counseling opportunities for affected families, and presenting treatment options for those disorders for which therapeutic options are available. Clearly, the key outcome of our investigation is the identification of biomarker (3-OH-IVA and b-OH-b) with therapeutic relevance (biotin, KD) for patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting that our results should be investigated in additional autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cohorts.  Conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. =",16dedeba-ee9d-40ed-bb9e-f5c5456132ee
