0,introduction0,"Developmental seizure-induced brain damage is often accompanied by cognitive deficits, memory disorders, emotional abnormalities, etc. (Rzezak et al., 2017; Vidaurre and Twanow, 2017; De Toffol et al., 2018), which has serious consequences on families and society. At present, 20 to 30% of patients with epilepsy do not experience relief after reasonable standard drug treatment, which is known as refractory epilepsy (López González et al., 2015). Temporal lobe epilepsy is one of the most common forms of refractory epilepsy and is caused by changes in molecular networks, and structure and function after brain injury, leading to a pathological environment that ultimately promotes excitability and produces repeated spontaneous seizures. This process is known as epileptogenesis (Jehi and Vezzani, 2014). The mechanism of epileptogenesis may be multifactorial and is not yet fully understood, limiting the development of new drugs.",0094a595-44a9-4549-ace7-07ce6f62013c
1,introduction1," Therefore, exploring the pathophysiological mechanisms of epileptogenesis is critical to the development of new, safe, and effective drugs.  An imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition defines the mechanism of epilepsy (Staley, 2015), and zinc ions are involved in convulsive excitotoxic neuronal injury. Zinc ions interact with various targets that mediate neuronal excitation or inhibition. For example, using zinc ion chelating agent (TPEN) to induce zinc deficiency in an in vitro neuronal cell model, zinc deficiency was shown to cause decreased cell viability and increased rates of apoptotic. These changes are reversed by zinc supplementation .  Zinc transporter 3 (ZnT-3) knockout mice are more sensitive to seizures caused by kainic acid injection due to their lack of synaptic zinc ions (Mcallister and Dyck, 2017), indicating that a deficiency in synaptic zinc ions reduces seizure thresholds.",490bea59-161e-49ab-a28d-0e67bcc6a6a9
2,introduction2," Ketogenic diet (KD) is a nutritional treatment that is beneficial in epilepsy refractory to antiepileptic drugs. It was previously shown that the mechanism(s) of KD’s action involve altered zinc metabolism, as KD rescues seizure-induced elevated ZnT-3 expression in the hippocampus . We recently demonstrated that glutamate stimulation of HT22 hippocampal neurons significantly increases intracellular zinc ion concentrations, which is positively correlated with mitophagy levels and mitochondrial dysfunction . These studies highlight the possibility that zinc ion signaling is a novel target for inhibiting epileptogenesis.  At present, there are few studies using in vivo models to investigate the effects of zinc intervention on epilepsy, and the results are often contradictory due to the type of epilepsy, the dose of zinc intervention and the route of administration. Kumar et al. (2015) once investigated the effect of zinc ions on acute seizures.",29d0dc09-7edb-4d63-b444-b30b4f0deccc
3,introduction3," They found that oral administration of 2, 20, or 200 mg/kg zinc sulfate for 2 weeks did not affect acute seizures induced by maximum electroconvulsive shock; however, 2 mg/kg zinc administration significantly reduced seizure duration and increased the latency of seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)). In addition, 200 mg/kg zinc sulfate intervention significantly reduced the number of ignited animals and reduced the seizure severity score. In contrast, Baraka et al. (2012) reported the opposite results. They found that intraperitoneal injection of zinc sulfate at 60 mg/kg for 3 weeks increased the severity of pilocarpine-induced seizures. Therefore, it is necessary to further study the role of zinc in epilepsy and its underlying molecular mechanisms using in vivo animal models.  Assessing the effects of different concentrations of zinc diet on developmental seizure-induced brain damage may be an important step in elucidating the role of zinc in epilepsy.",8ab1d3a1-9d9d-41c5-9a88-5bcab6eef995
4,introduction4," Based on the in vivo animal model of developmental seizures induced by lithium chloride-pilocarpine, this study explored the long-term effects of zinc deficiency and zinc supplementation on developmental seizure-induced brain damage, focusing on the parameters of cognition, seizure threshold, hippocampal regenerative mossy fiber sprouting and expression of ZnT-3 and GPR39 in hippocampus to further reveal the relationship between zinc and epileptogenesis and provide new insights for the prevention and treatment of epilepsy. G protein-coupled receptor 39 (GPR39) is a metabotropic zinc-specific receptor . GPR39 knockout enhances susceptibility to kainic acid-induced seizures and increases seizure duration . In addition, we assessed expression of myelin basic protein (myelin basic protein (MBP)) because it plays a key role in controlling neuronal membrane integrity and axonal regeneration .

23,discussion0,"This study investigated the effects of different concentrations of dietary zinc on long-term cognition, seizure threshold, MF sprouting and gene expression in the hippocampus following lithium chloride-pilocarpine-induced developmental seizures. There are three main findings in this study. First, a zinc-deficient diet for 4 weeks aggravates seizure-induced weight loss, cognitive impairment and decreased concentration of serum zinc as well as seizure threshold, while increasing aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, which were in parallel with reduced expression of GPR39, ZnT -3 and myelin basic protein (MBP) in the hippocampus. Second, a zinc supplemented diet for 4 weeks significantly improves the abovementioned injury-related changes caused by developmental seizures and may correct the abnormal expression of GPR39, ZnT-3, and myelin basic protein (MBP) in the hippocampus.",b398ce25-4faa-4e31-b69b-a204f1484703
24,discussion1," Third, the expression pattern of myelin basic protein (MBP) in hippocampus coincided with aberrant sprouting of mossy fibers. In addition, low-zinc or high-zinc diet intervention for 2 weeks exerted no significant effect on body weight, cognition, or serum zinc concentrations.  Epidemiological data indicate that a large number of diseases affecting one-third of the world’s population is attributed to zinc deficiency, and a lack of bioavailable zinc intake in the diet is the most common cause of zinc deficiency . Karweina et al. (2015) showed that high doses of zinc oxide may lead to imbalanced zinc homeostasis in animals and changes in ZIP4 methylation. Zinc deficiency and zinc supplementation also affect homocysteine levels and related enzyme expression in rats . Rats fed rice with fortified zinc oxide exhibited significantly increased body weight (Della Lucia et al., 2014). Our current results are consistent with these studies.",7b0f0fc3-9d49-41f4-8204-40e737139082
25,discussion2," Herein, three different dietary Zn levels were used in growing rats according to previous studies (Nagatomo et al., 1998; Takeda et al., 2006b). Serum zinc concentrations were measured at P43 and P57. Results showed that at P57 following 4 weeks of differential diet treatments, there were significantly lower serum zinc concentration in the ZD group and significantly higher serum zinc concentration in ZS groups compared to the control group. Correspondingly, low-zinc and high-zinc diet interventions for 4 weeks had significant effects on body weight and cognition in control groups. These results indicate that long-term zinc deficiency or high zinc in the diet causes decreased or increased blood zinc concentrations, potentially affecting growth and development.",6f9da6ce-310d-47a0-a98d-6f52021084ec
26,discussion3," However, our study also showed that different doses of zinc in the diet for 2 weeks had no significant effects on body weight or cognition in normal rats and showed no significant differences in serum zinc concentration in ZD and ZS groups compared to the normal zinc diet control group at P43. This indicates that under normal physiological conditions, the body has a regulatory mechanism for blood zinc concentration, which is not easily imbalanced by dietary zinc deficiency.  There are many studies on the effects of zinc loading or deprivation on seizure thresholds. The earliest report came from the Barry-Sterman team. They found that zinc loading delayed kindled seizure induction, while zinc deprivation accelerated kindling (Barry-Sterman et al., 1986). Subsequently, using seizure-susceptible EL mice, Fukahori and Itoh (1990) found that zinc deficiency causes increased seizure susceptibility, while reducing by zinc loading, but an adequate diet had no effect.",8a467cfc-8670-41ad-a7a6-39e3bcda79ba
27,discussion4," However, using the same epilepsy-susceptible EL mice, a study by Nagatomo et al. (1998) denied this conclusion. They showed that convulsive seizures in EL mice fed a Zn-deficient diet for 4 weeks were more effectively inhibited than in mice receiving a high zinc or sufficient zinc diet for the same period. However, later studies by Takeda et al. (2003a, 2005, 2006a, 2009) reinforced the idea that young mice fed a zinc-deficient diet for 4 weeks experienced reduced convulsive threshold. This is in accordance with our present findings. Herein, we also found that zinc-deficient diets for 4 weeks reduced seizure threshold, while the threshold increased after 4 weeks of a zinc supplemented diet. The underlying mechanisms whereby this occurs have not been clearly defined, but parallel changes in cognitive deficits and aberrant sprouting of hippocampal mossy fibers provide valuable clues.",cefd4f30-00a7-416c-bfb8-e79a8eb53b24
28,discussion5,"  Here, we compared the different effects of zinc loading or deprivation on cognitive function through the novel object recognition test. The novel object recognition test is a popular method for detecting rodent non-spatial memory neurobiology. The principle of this test is that rodents have a natural tendency to explore new items. The memory capacity and degree of damage are assessed by quantitatively calculating the amount of time the rodent spends exploring presented objects. Here, we showed that at P42 following 2 weeks zinc loading or deprivation, there was no significant difference in the recognition index of each group among the non-penicillin-treated control, ZD and ZS groups. On the other hand, however, the recognition indexes were significantly reduced in penicillin-treated SE, SE + ZD, and SE + ZS groups compared to the corresponding control, ZD and ZS groups, respectively.",f4ab97bf-73af-4bf6-b9a8-6b84b8a90507
29,discussion6," This suggests that developmental seizures can cause long-term cognitive impairment, which is consistent with previous studies (Ni et al., 2009, 2018). The results also showed that 2-week dietary treatment with different zinc concentrations had no significant intervention effect on cognitive impairment. Notably, at P56 following 4 weeks zinc loading or deprivation, although there was still a significant reduction in the recognition index of penicillin-treated SE and SE + ZD groups compared to the corresponding control and ZD groups, but the recognition index in rats of the zinc loading-treated SE + ZS group increased significantly compared to the normal diet-treated SE group, which indicated that the 4-week zinc loading diet can significantly improve long-term cognitive impairment caused by developmental seizures. We hypothesize that this neuroprotective effect of zinc loading diet may be related to the regulation of hippocampal zinc metabolism homeostasis.",b6134a9a-cb06-4e70-bf04-75bf88dd0102
30,discussion7," The rodent hippocampus plays an important role in the memory of the encoded object, and temporary or permanent damage to the hippocampus will destroy the memory of the object (Cohen and Stackman, 2015). The hippocampus is susceptible to zinc deficiency in the brain. In particular, zinc deficiency reduces the reactive zinc pool, as revealed by hippocampal histochemical Timm staining, which is closely related to high susceptibility to seizures (Takeda et al., 2003b, 2006b; Takeda and Tamano, 2009). Zn(2+) coexists with glutamate at the end of hippocampal mossy fiber and regulates its release, thereby affecting synaptic function . The incidence of tonic-clonic convulsion was markedly increased after i.p. injection of zinc chelators Clioquinol (CQ) and TPEN in adult Noda epileptic rats .",a62d2ea8-e2b1-4a79-828b-a491042c12f6
31,discussion8," Combined with the finding in this study that zinc loading diet intervention markedly improved the regenerative mossy fiber sprouting in hippocampus induced by developmental seizures as revealed by Timm staining, we speculate that one of the mechanisms for this neuroprotection may be related to the improvement of zinc transporter-mediated mossy fiber spouting in hippocampus.  In this study, we examined expression of zinc metabolism-related genes. GPR39 is a rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor consisting of 435 amino acid residues and is classified as a member of the ghrelin/neurotensin receptor subfamily according to its amino acid sequence. In addition to its expression in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, fat, and pancreas, GPR39 is also widely expressed in the hippocampus, which is also a zinc-enriched region, suggesting the neurotransmitter role of zinc may be related to GPR39 (Khan, 2016).",d40c9c68-39cc-47ad-8ed3-86749ba512b9
32,discussion9," It was initially thought that obestatin was a natural ligand for GPR39, and later Holst et al. (2007) suggested that Zn2+ may be a “physiological regulator” of GPR39. Synaptically released Zn(2+) triggers metabotropic activity in the CA3 region of cultured hippocampal neurons, which was attenuated by knockdown of GPR39 expression . Our present findings indicate that a zinc-deficient diet can further lead to decreased expression of GPR39 in the hippocampus, which in turn aggravates cognitive impairment. In contrast, we demonstrated for the first time that a zinc supplemented diet significantly improves cognitive dysfunction and up-regulates expression of GPR39 in the hippocampus, suggesting a protective effect of high-zinc intervention on developmental seizure-induced brain damage.",52449928-6501-48c9-8a4a-45ab8c83f4db
33,discussion10," In combination with clinical studies, which indicate that serum zinc levels in untreated epileptic children and in children with systemic refractory epilepsy were significantly lower than in healthy controls (Wojciak et al., 2007; Seven et al., 2013; Kheradmand et al., 2014; Saad et al., 2014), our results suggest that a zinc supplemented diet may have potential translational medical value for the intervention of developmental convulsive brain damage.  Currently, only two studies from Siegward and Kumar have found that a zinc supplemented diet suppresses convulsive seizures and reduce seizure thresholds . In addition, a study by Contestabile et al. (2016) found that 4 weeks of zinc supplementation strongly impairs consolidation of hippocampal-dependent memory in wild type adult rats through contextual fear conditioning and inhibitory avoidance testing. This is consistent with our present results.",2128e6ff-74ef-404e-be64-b83114ea5bd7
34,discussion11," Herein, we also showed that the recognition indexes were significantly reduced in ZD groups compared to the control group. Moreover, our study demonstrated that a zinc supplemented diet attenuates cognitive impairment caused by developmental seizures, as shown by the comparison between SE and SE + ZS groups. This is in accordance with a study from Cope et al. (2011) who revealed that supplemental zinc prevents cognitive and behavioral deficits associated with traumatic brain injury (traumatic brain injury (TBI)).  Of particular interest, we found that the intervention effect of a zinc supplemented diet on cognitive impairment caused by developmental seizures was consistent with the effect on hippocampal regenerative mossy fiber sprouting and was consistent with expression of myelin basic protein (MBP). The mechanism for this phenomenon is still unclear.",690ccd31-d3b1-40c0-b2ae-e34e6c30971a
35,discussion12," However, the finding that hippocampal regenerative mossy fiber sprouting and myelin basic protein (MBP) are both brain damage indicators rather than the cause of brain damage may help explain the phenomenon of synchronization between the two indicators in the pathophysiological process of brain injury and repair. myelin basic protein (MBP) is one of the most abundant structural proteins in oligodendrocyte myelin and is essential for cognitive function. myelin basic protein (MBP) is negatively correlated with the severity of seizure-induced brain injury and has been recognized as a biomarker for brain damage. myelin basic protein (MBP) is reduced in epileptic foci in patients with refractory epilepsy, suggesting that this change interferes with the transmission of nerve impulses . Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE)) is usually associated with cognitive deficits. Proteomics analysis by Persike et al.",9ca9826f-f777-4943-a6f2-7b74b93f2bab
36,discussion13," (2018) demonstrated up-regulated protein level of myelin basic protein (MBP) in Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients, suggesting a compensatory mechanism due to epilepsy-related nerve damage. Song et al. (2018) observed the damage of myelin microstructure and the decrease of myelin basic protein (MBP) caused by lithium-pilocarpine-induced state convulsion in immature rats by transmission electron microscopy and Western blot analysis, this damage was improved after down-regulating Lingo-1 expression. Meanwhile, it is recently noted that the seizure-induced hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting may not be a potential therapeutic target for epilepsy, but only a pathological hallmark change caused by convulsive brain injury (Cavarsan et al., 2018; Koyama and Ikegaya, 2018). Further, myelin basic protein (MBP) is also reported to induce the proliferation of cultured Schwann cells and astrocytes and thus improve the integrity of the neuronal plasma membrane (Tzeng et al.",dbd6c048-74d0-4ca5-a769-381e649b8c38
37,discussion14,", 1999; Snaidero et al., 2017). Based on these findings, we speculate that similar alterations between the expression pattern of myelin basic protein (MBP) and aberrant sprouting of mossy fibers in the hippocampus may indicate that sprouting is a secondary pathological change caused by developmental brain damage rather than the cause of epileptogenesis. Up-regulation of myelin basic protein (MBP) protein levels in the high zinc diet-treated seizure group (SE + ZS), as well as the corresponding improvement of cognitive impairment and reduced hippocampal mossy fiber regenerative sprouting, may represent a compensatory mechanism for neuronal membrane damage and repair.  It is worth noting that expression patterns of ZnT-3 observed in this study were not entirely consistent with observed changes in hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting. However, this does not negate the traditional notion that ZnT-3 is a sprouting marker.",37901eda-d03b-43ee-bd4e-10d66c0d6344
38,discussion15," Since we tested expression levels of ZnT-3 protein in the entire hippocampus, we did not selectively detect expression of ZnT-3 in the mossy fiber pathway. Local anatomic-specific pathway expression changes using immunohistochemistry techniques merit further investigation.  Conclusion A Zinc-deficient diet for 4 weeks aggravates long-term adverse effects of developmental seizures, including parameters of weight, cognition, seizure threshold and serum zinc concentration, which paralleled expression changes observed in hippocampal GPR39 and ZnT-3. In contrast, zinc supplementation for 4 weeks significantly improved the above described damage-related changes, attenuating the abnormal expression of GPR39, ZnT-3, and myelin basic protein (MBP) in the hippocampus.",9f4413f7-f5c0-42ab-930e-9d2f1835d326
