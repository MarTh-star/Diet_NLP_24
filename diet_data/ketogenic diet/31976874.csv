0,background0,"Epilepsy is a severe neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent behavioral seizures and abnormal synchronized neuronal firing. Despite the availability of numerous drugs in the clinic, approximately one-third of the patients develop resistance to these treatment regimens [1]. Identifying novel molecular targets for epilepsy will provide a framework to develop highly potent therapeutic strategies.  The ketogenic diet (KD) is rich in fat with adequate protein and low carbohydrates content and is known to induce a sustained ketotic state by producing heightened ketone bodies. Being a part of bioenergetics medicine therapies, the KD is frequently utilized either alone or in combination with other anti-seizure drugs to treat refractory epilepsy [2]. However, its application has been restricted due to, at least in part, dietary compliance and adverse side effects [3].",f4580dbd-b905-43fe-9ce1-2d0243aea58e
1,background1," Understanding the critical cellular and molecular signaling mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of the KD will not only provide insights into mechanisms of epilepsy but also facilitate to develop effective pharmacological strategies. Previous studies have identified roles of the KD in the regulation of mitochondrial respiration, oxidative stress, inflammation, protein post-translational modifications, gut microbiota-brain communication, ion channel properties [4]. However, the exact molecular mechanisms through which the KD induces beneficial effects on controlling seizures remain obscure.  γ-Amino butyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. GABAergic transmission functions to integrate excitatory inputs, synchronize neuronal activities, control synaptic plasticity and prevent the generation and spread of paroxysmal activities [5].",126c2330-4e79-4759-aff4-11ec640c105f
2,background2," A vast amount of evidence has demonstrated that deficiency in GABAergic functions could lead to epilepsy. Blockade of GABAergic transmission by antagonists of GABA receptors, including pentylenetetrazole (pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)) and bicuculline, causes acute epileptic discharges, which has been widely used as experimental epilepsy models [6]. Likewise, various anti-epileptic drugs like benzodiazepines, barbiturates and tiagabine, are known to alleviate seizures by enhancing GABAergic inhibition [7]. Remarkably, numerous studies have reported that KD treatment elevated GABA levels but not excitatory acid-glutamate in both human and murine brains [8–10]. These observations suggest a potential role of the KD in the regulation of GABAergic activity in the brain. However, this has not been systematically investigated at the synaptic level, and the exact underlying regulatory mechanisms remain to be elucidated.",0d727af5-90b1-454e-ac34-9725c89752a7
3,background3,"  In the present study, we address these questions by using a combination of genetic, electrophysiological and biochemical tools. We find that KD treatment suppresses seizures in both acute and chronic seizure animal models and elevates the GABAergic but not glutamatergic activity in the hippocampus. By screening the molecular targets that potentially linked to GABAergic transmission through transcriptome analysis, we identify that the Nrg1 expression was dramatically increased by KD treatment. Disruption of Nrg1 signaling by genetically deleting its receptor-ErbB4 diminishes the effects of the KD on GABAergic synaptic transmission and seizures. Altogether, these findings suggest a critical role of Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling in mediating the effects of KD on GABAergic activity and seizure resistance, which sheds light on developing new therapeutic interventions to seizure control.

19,results0,"The ketogenic diet exhibits protective effects in both acute and chronic seizure models To examine the effects of the ketogenic diet (KD) on seizure, we first fed adult male mice with the KD or composition-matched control diet (CD) for 3 weeks (Fig. 1a and b). The serum levels of β-hydroxybutyrate, a primary form of ketones, were markedly elevated in KD-fed mice compared with that in CD-fed mice (Fig. 1c). In contrast, we observed reduced glucose levels in mice fed with the KD (Fig. 1d). These results indicate that KD treatment successfully induces a state of increased ketone bodies in mice. In the acute seizure model, kainic acid (KA) was micro-infused into the amygdala to induce seizures (Fig. 1e).

Previous studies report that ErbB4 is exclusively expressed in the GABAeric interneuron in the hippocampus [13, 14]. As a ligand, Nrg1 activates ErbB4 to promote GABAergic synaptic transmission [15]. To further validate the transcriptome data, we performed RT-PCR and Western Blot to detect mRNA and protein levels of Nrg1 and ErbB4. As shown in Fig. 5e to g, while ErbB4 expression was not significantly altered, both the mRNA and protein levels of Nrg1 were dramatically increased in KD-fed mice.",3e8e4c69-76e0-4c5a-889e-f7390bb9ad78

We first bilaterally injected adeno-associated virus (AAV-hSyn-Cre-mcherry), expressing Cre recombinase and red fluorescent protein-mcherry, into the hippocampus of floxed-ErbB4 (ErbB4f/f) mice (Fig. 6a) to delete ErbB4 specifically from hippocampus.

These observations indicate accurate and reliable knockdown of ErbB4 in the hippocampus. Two weeks after virus injection, mice were subjected to KD feeding for 3 weeks. We then recorded eIPSCs and sIPSCs of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region (Fig. 5e). Both amplitude of eIPSC and frequency of sIPSCs were increased in KD-fed mice compared with those in CD-fed mice (Fig. 5f–i), which is consistent with previous results. However, there were no differences between Cre-virus-injected mice fed with KD and those fed with CD (Fig. 5f–i), suggesting a critical role of ErbB4 in mediating the effects of KD on inhibitory synaptic transmission.

These findings provide insight into not only pathophysiological functions of Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling in epilepsy but also indicate that such signaling mechanism can be therapeutically manipulated to treat refractory epilepsy.  KD therapy has been approved to be an effective treatment for epilepsy. Yet, the exact underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Numerous studies have reported that the GABA level is increased explicitly in the brains of humans and animal models with KD treatment [8–10]. In light of the critical role of GABAergic signaling in controlling seizures, understanding the molecular regulatory mechanisms will facilitate the development of precise interventions that lack adverse effects of the KD.",cbb1e45c-cd66-4432-a731-9127e47c4689
42,discussion1," In the hippocampus, GABAergic transmission is tightly regulated by Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling [15]. EbrB4 is exclusively expressed in GABAergic interneurons in the cortex and hippocampus [14]. Activation of ErbB4 by its ligand-Nrg1 increased the probability of GABA release from the axonal terminal [13, 17]. Interestingly, alteration of Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling is implicated in epilepsy animal models and human patients [18–20], and disruption of Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling pharmacologically and/or genetically promotes kindling progression, which results in increased spontaneous seizures in kindling epilepsy model [18]. These reports reveal a critical role of Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling in the regulation of epileptogenesis.  Our results provide compelling evidence supporting the hypothesis that Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling is pivotal for the anti-seizure effects of the KD.",12c61ad8-30c8-4c14-b45b-8e57c0de170f
43,discussion2," By using multiple techniques including RNAseq, RT-PCR and Western blot, we demonstrate that Nrg1 expression is dramatically elevated in the hippocampus of mice fed with the KD; Moreover, ErbB4 deletion in the hippocampus or PV+ interneurons abolishes the effects of the KD on both GABAergic activity and seizures. Collectively, these findings indicate that Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling in the hippocampus is indispensable for the anti-seizure effect of KD. However, it is not clear how Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling regulates GABA release.  Previous reports have proposed several potential downstream targets for Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling, including voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1, which mediate the effect of Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling on the firing of PV+ interneurons in the cortex [19]; voltage-gated sodium channel, whose activity in ErbB4+ neurons was reduced by Nrg1 treatment in vitro [21]; transient outward channel Kv4.",8a5806c1-978e-4fd0-831f-ba2d7ff4ad27
44,discussion3,"2, whose expression was increased by Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling through the Akt/mTOR pathway in cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons [22]. Future studies are needed to verify whether such mechanisms underlie the role of Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling in the anti-seizure effects of KD.  Recent studies have identified several electrical modulators affected by the KD, including ATP-sensitive K+ channels [23], voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels [24], AMPA-type glutamate receptors [25], adenosine A1 receptors [26], vesicular glutamate transporters [27], lactate dehydrogenase [28]. In these reports, KD treatment downregulated either the excitability of pyramidal neurons or the excitatory synaptic transmission. However, some other studies also indicated an unaltered glutamate level in both rodent animal models and human patients with KD treatment [9, 10].",147b725b-0806-4164-9571-01f0c910f43e
45,discussion4," While the reason for the discrepancy is not clear, we examined the excitatory synaptic transmission on the SC-CA1 synapses and found that neither eEPSC nor sEPSCs was changed between mice fed with the KD and those fed with the CD, implicating minimal effects of the KD on excitatory synaptic transmission, specifically (if not all) on SC-CA1 synapses. It is noteworthy that, Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling in the hippocampus and amygdala at the adult stage exhibits little effect on excitatory synaptic transmission [13, 17], which is in accord with our observations. Based on these results, we postulate that the KD alters inhibition/excitation balance by increasing GABA release through up-regulation of Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling, which eventually influences seizure threshold and epileptogenesis. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that those proposed molecular targets described above may also involve in the regulation of Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling.",74c7631d-e478-4df7-ab5a-548a4870960b
46,discussion5," Future studies are warranted to investigate the potential interactions among these factors.  It is not clear so far about the underlying mechanisms through which KD treatment increases Nrg1 expression. Previous studies have indicated that dysregulated epigenetic changes, including acetylation of histones, play a prominent role in regulating epileptogenesis [29]. Notably, a well-known anti-epileptic drug-valproic acid (valproic acid (VPA)), also an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (Histone Deacetylase (HDAC)s), increases H3 acetylation in the brain [30], eventually suppresses seizures by increasing the levels of GABA in the brain. These findings support the disease-modifying effect of histone acetylation status. More importantly, β-hydroxybutyrate, the main form of ketone bodies, is reported to increase histone acetylation and serves as an endogenous Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor [31].",4f7991f7-c56b-4a7c-b23f-480327bbde60
47,discussion6," Indeed, several studies have reported the beneficial effects of KD/ketone bodies on oxidative stress and spatial memory, probably through acetylation regulation [32, 33]. It is interesting to investigate in the future whether KD affects Nrg1 expression via histone acetylation and the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates an important role of Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling in mediating the anti-seizure effects of KD and provide insight into the epilepsy treatment.
