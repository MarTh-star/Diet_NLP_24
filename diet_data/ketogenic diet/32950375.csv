0,background0," Anti-seizure medication (Anti seizure medication (ASM)) treatment is one of the significant risk factors associated with abnormal vitamin D status in epilepsy patients. Multiple studies have shown that adult epilepsy patients can exhibit vitamin D deficiency. However, there are few reports investigating pediatric epilepsy patients. In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors related to hypovitaminosis D in pediatric epilepsy patients in Thailand. ",c14c70f6-6321-431b-b5da-f3439136102d
1,methods0," This study was designed as both a cross-sectional study to evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and a retrospective cohort study to investigate the factors affecting vitamin D levels in children with epilepsy who were treated with Anti seizure medication (ASM)s. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Royal Thai Army Medical Department (R227h/60). Informed consent was obtained from the patients or their parents/guardians.  We enrolled 138 pediatric epilepsy patients aged 1–20 years at the Neurology pediatric clinic at Phramongkutklao Hospital from April 2018 to January 2019. Patients that had abnormal kidney or liver function, received vitamin D supplements, or were on a ketogenic diet containing vitamin D were excluded.  The data collected from the patients included age, gender, weight, height, BMI, types of seizures, and cause of epilepsy. Puberty status was assessed using Tanner staging.",63be43bd-cf93-4b88-99d2-420b7a45851a
2,methods1," Daily activity abilities were divided into two categories; normal activity and limited activity, such as walking with aid, using a wheelchair, or bedridden. Developmental status was initially evaluated using the Denver II test. If developmental delay was suspected, patients under 6 years of age were assessed with Mullen Scales of Early Learning (Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL)), and the children older than 6 years of age were tested with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition. The duration of sun exposure between 10 am and 2 pm per day were assessed through an interview and recorded.  The name, number, and duration of the Anti seizure medication (ASM) treatments were recorded.",96eb112a-e348-412f-a038-92a59724ff07
3,methods2," Participants were divided into the enzyme-inducing Anti seizure medication (ASM) (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin), valproate, and benzodiazepine (benzodiazepine (BZD)) and newer Anti seizure medication (ASM)s (diazepam, clonazepam, clobazam, topiramate, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, zonisamide, vigabatrin, oxcarbamazepine, gabapentin, lacosamide, perampanel, and rufinamide) groups based on the type of Anti seizure medication (ASM) used.  Serum 25(OH) D levels were used to categorize the vitamin D status, which was defined as vitamin D sufficiency: 25(OH) D level >  30 ng/ml (75 nmol/L), vitamin D insufficiency: 25(OH) D level 20–30 ng/ml (50–75 nmol/L), and vitamin D deficiency. 25(OH) D level < 20 ng/ml (75 nmol/L) [ 11 ] . In this study, we combine the insufficiency and deficiency groups into the hypovitaminosis D group for the purpose of our analyses.  Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 for Mac (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).",bebf5db0-90b3-4286-8a36-ad916a9b991e
4,methods3, Fisher’s exact and the chi-square test were used to analyze categorical data. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to analyze continuous data. Logistic Regression was used to predict risk factors of hypovitaminosis D. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. ,2c013f85-b0a7-4341-a233-92a89d9608ef
5,results3," The enzyme-inhibiting Anti seizure medication (ASM) group, which only included valproate, was comprised of 53 patients, whereas the benzodiazepine (BZD) and newer Anti seizure medication (ASM)s group comprised 113 patients. The most commonly used newer Anti seizure medication (ASM) was levetiracetam (80 patients), followed by topiramate (53 patients). Seventeen and 36 patients received a low (less than 5 mg/kg/day) and high (5 mg/kg/day or more) dose of topiramate, respectively. Other Anti seizure medication (ASM)s in this group were benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, diazepam, and clobazam (21 patients); lamotrigine (5 patients); zonisamide (2 patients); vigabatrin (3 patients); lacosamide (10 patients); perampanel (11 patients); and rufinamide (1 patient).",f75b5198-e790-49a4-97a3-7c57505281bb

Specifically, patients who had undergone puberty had a 5.4-times (95% confidence interval 1.9–15.7) higher risk of hypovitaminosis D than pre-pubescent patients.",3b81b087-ae11-4008-b852-88e495695c5f

8,discussion0," Which role the drugs play for the vitamin D deficiency is still uncertain [7–9, 11, 12]. VPA seems to exert the least influence, while the effect of the new generation of Anti seizure medication (ASM)s one cannot say anything certain about, based on the results from this study.  We found that the prevalence rate of vitamin D deficiency in pediatric epilepsy patients in Bangkok, Thailand was 23.2%, which was similar to the rates reported in previous studies conducted in Thailand [10] and Malaysia [9]. However, when we considered both vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D insufficiency together as hypovitaminosis D, our results indicated that approximately two-thirds of pediatric epilepsy patients had hypovitaminosis D, even though Thailand is located in the tropical zone.  Similar to the previous reports, we also found puberty status to be a key risk factor of hypovitaminosis D.",7c4578ee-523f-4547-b39f-f3c25ba5692e
9,discussion1," This may be because puberty represents a critical period of skeletal bone mineralization, which results in a high rate of vitamin D utilization and increased need for vitamin D, leading to high rates of deficiency [13].  The other factors included in our analyses, namely BMI, cause of epilepsy, physical activity status, developmental status, Anti seizure medication (ASM)s used for monotherapy or polytherapy, and duration of sun exposure, were not significantly associated with hypovitaminosis D.  More than 2 years of Anti seizure medication (ASM) use was significantly associated with hypovitaminosis D in the univariate analysis but not in the multivariate analysis. This may be because various drugs were simultaneously studied, and they may affect vitamin D levels through different mechanisms.  Interestingly, 53 of the 138 patients (38%) were receiving an enzyme-inhibiting Anti seizure medication (ASM) (valproate).",d493dfee-e5ba-49e2-ba6d-86ab3301f2b7
10,discussion2," The multivariate analysis revealed that those treated with non-enzyme-inhibiting Anti seizure medication (ASM)s had a 3.5-times higher risk of hypovitaminosis D than those treated with enzyme-inhibiting Anti seizure medication (ASM)s. This finding is similar to those of previous studies that found normal levels of active vitamin D in patients receiving valproate therapy [14–16]. One study found that patients receiving valproate monotherapy had fewer negative effects on bone markers and better bone density than those receiving enzyme-inducing Anti seizure medication (ASM) (phenytoin, carbamazepine) monotherapy [17]. However, the findings from studies of bone metabolism in patients receiving valproate are controversial, and it is difficult to make a comparison because of varying study designs [18]. More evidence is needed on the effect of valproate use on bone health.  Among our participants, the most commonly used newer Anti seizure medication (ASM)s were levetiracetam (57.",7e64df22-7b2a-40c5-8ea7-3add67b50eca
11,discussion3,"9%) and topiramate (38.4%). As seen in previous studies, we found no statistically significant association between newer Anti seizure medication (ASM) use and vitamin D level. This may be because newer Anti seizure medication (ASM)s, except for topiramate and oxcarbazepine, do not affect CYP450, the enzyme that regulates the metabolism of vitamin D in the liver [19, 20]. Additionally, another study showed no association between the use of newer Anti seizure medication (ASM)s and decreased bone mineral density [21].  Among newer Anti seizure medication (ASM)s, topiramate has unique pharmacokinetics in that it acts as an enzyme-inhibiting agent (metabolized via CYP2C19 in the liver) at low doses (< 200 mg/day in adults) and as an enzyme-inducing agent (metabolized via CYP3A4) at high doses (≥ 200 mg/day) [19, 20, 22]. Hence, we divided participants receiving topiramate into the low dose (< 5 mg/kg/day) and high dose (≥ 5 mg/kg/day) groups in our analysis.",ca5f0c1f-e783-4680-b82b-cd64e6e4032d
12,discussion4," We found that more patients in the high dose group had hypovitaminosis D than in the low dose group (80.6 and 58.8%, respectively), although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.092, Fig. 2).Fig. 2 Topiramate was compared between 2 groups, one was a low dose (< 5 mg/kg/day) in 17 patients and the other was a high dose (≥ 5 mg/kg/day) in 36 patients. The result was showed the high dose group was more hypovitaminosis D (25(OH) D < 30 ng/ml) than the low dose group, 80.6, and 58.8% respectively  We recognize that our study has a limitation of a small sample size. A multicenter study with a large number of participants should be conducted in the future to confirm our results.  Conclusion  Our study shows a relatively high prevalence rate of vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D insufficiency of 23.2 and 47.8%, respectively, even though Thailand is located in the tropical zone.",cf1a3347-165e-44ab-be3d-60a0cd528b53
13,discussion5," The key risk factors of hypovitaminosis D are puberty status and non-enzyme-inhibiting Anti seizure medication (ASM) use. There is currently a lack of guidelines on the appropriate time to assess the vitamin D status of epilepsy patients. Our findings suggest that clinicians who treat pediatric epilepsy patients, especially those entering puberty and being prescribed non-enzyme-inhibiting Anti seizure medication (ASM)s should consider regular monitoring of vitamin D adequacy. In cases of hypovitaminosis D, clinicians should recommend prompt vitamin D supplementation as it is essential to prevent pathological fractures and osteoporosis for the patients in later life.",e544f06c-4327-45be-8dfd-51805494ae4b
