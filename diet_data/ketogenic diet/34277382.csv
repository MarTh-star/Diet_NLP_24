Results  3.1. A Multi-Omic Approach Highlights Specific Signatures in Cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) Mutation  To gain an insight into the metabolic changes of Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS), a targeted metabolomic analysis of 188 metabolites was carried out on cellular extracts from cybrid SHSY-5Y neuronal cells with different m.3243A > G mutation loads (i.e.",79c913c4-2f1d-44df-94ec-deb023a23d73
11,methods11,", 70%, 90%, and 98%), and compared to control cells. Unsupervised principal component analysis (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) of metabolomic data from parental cells (n = 10) and cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation with different mutation loads (n = 30) revealed a clear distinction between mutant and non-mutant cells (Figure 1A,B), as well as between cells with different mutation loads (Figure 1C), which validates the metabolomic analysis.  Compared to control cells, mutant cells with 70 to 98% mutation loads revealed a metabolic signature characterised by significantly lower levels of six acylcarnitines (i.e., C0, C2, C4, C16, C18, C18:1) and 10 amino acids (i.e., alanine, glutamine, serine, lysine, proline, glycine, serotonin, spermine, arginine, and taurine) (Figure 1D).",469abee1-23b3-4eca-95b7-30ec5f2ce906
12,methods12," Interestingly, arginine and taurine, two key amino acids already known to be involved in the pathophysiology of Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) were significantly reduced in mutant cells. In addition, several phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and sphingomyelins were significantly increased in mutant cells (Figure 1D). Interestingly, the comparison of the metabolic signature of cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation with different mutation loads identified 10 amino acids (i.e., phenylalanine, tyrosine, valine, tryptophan, isoleucine, leucine, threonine, histidine, methionine, and alpha-aminoadipic acid), concentrations of which were significantly decreased between the 70% and 90% mutant cells, compared to 98% mutant cells (Figure 1E). Conversely, 14 metabolites, including 6 phosphocholines and lysophosphocholines, 8 amino acids (i.e.",cba972c6-06b5-45ca-ae8d-6d992ed674fa
13,methods13,", ornithine, acetyl ornithine, trans-4-hydroxyproline, aspartic acid, alanine, glutamine, glutamate, and DOPA) were significantly increased in 98% mutant cells, compared to lower mutation loads (Figure 1E), thus pointing to highly specific changes in amino acid and biogenic amine metabolite concentrations, according to the m.3243A > G heteroplasmy level.  3.2. The Level of Intracellular Glutamate Correlates Positively with the Heteroplasmy Level and Negatively with Mitochondrial Complex I Activity  Quantification of glutamate showed higher intracellular glutamate concentrations in cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation, reaching a four-fold increase in cells with a 98% mutation load compared to control cells (Figure 2A).",2ba598ed-f41d-4378-b84b-6e91dc71e0c3
14,methods14," Furthermore, the intracellular glutamate concentration was positively correlated with the heteroplasmy level in mutant cells (Figure 2A) and was inversely proportional to the complex I activity related to mitochondrial citrate synthase (CS) activity (Figure 2B). Likewise, the intracellular glutamate concentration was increased by 55% in 143B osteosarcoma cybrid cells with the m.3243A > G mutation and a 98% mutation load, compared to the 143B control cybrid cells (Figure S1A).  Next, we investigated the relationship between the level of glutamate and the activity of complex I by exposing control cells to rotenone, a complex I inhibitor, for 15 h. This experiment showed a 58.5% reduction in complex I activity compared to untreated cells, which was associated with a 245% increase in intracellular glutamate concentration, compared to untreated cells (Figure 2C,D). This suggests that the activity of mitochondrial complex I regulate the intracellular glutamate concentration.",ba25e24d-e1a2-4e7b-b5ae-e7ab4f26ccf5
15,methods15,"  In addition, the level of extracellular glutamate was also significantly increased in mutant cells of various mutation loads, compared to control cells (Figure 2E). Nevertheless, the extracellular glutamate concentration was lower in the 98% mutant cells compared to the 70% and 90% mutant cells (Figure 2E).  Since glutamine is a precursor for the biosynthesis of glutamate, we next monitored the intracellular glutamate level in cells cultured with or without glutamine. We found a reduction in intracellular glutamate in both the control and 98% mutant cells grown in a glutamine-free medium, suggesting that most of the intracellular glutamate is derived from glutamine (Figure 2F).  3.3.",78e3ca94-965b-4e78-b98c-e4f8f198779f
16,methods16," Transcriptomic Signature of Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) in 98% Mutant Cells Shows Upregulation of the Glutamate and Glutamine Metabolic Pathways  To gain further insights into the transcriptional regulation, gene expression profiling was carried out in the 98% mutant cells and compared to control cells. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and unsupervised clustering showed a clear difference between the 98% mutation load and control cells (Figure 3A). A comparison of the gene expression profile showed a total of 2046 differentially expressed genes with a p-value ≤ 0.05 (fold change ≥ 1.5) (Table S1). In the 98% mutant cells, 48% of genes were upregulated and 52% downregulated.  Analysis of these genes using the REACTOME pathway database predicted that a total of 955 metabolic pathways were involved in the process, with a p-value ≤ 0.05 (Table S2).",5406893b-0f5f-48d6-8122-6e6c2c4576c8
17,methods17," The three main gene clusters involved were: (i) the glutamate and glutamine metabolism (R-HSA-8964539), (ii) the gamma-aminobutyric acid (gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)) synthesis, release, reuptake, and degradation; (R-HSA-888590) and (iii) the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (tricarboxylic acid (TCA)) cycle (R-HSA-71403) (Table 1). This is in accordance with the glutamate and mitochondrial dysregulation revealed by our metabolomic analysis. The expression of a large number of genes involved in the glutamate and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathways were significantly altered (Figure 3B, C). The most upregulated genes were two key genes of the glutamate pathway, namely GLUD1 and GAD1, which encode glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH)) and glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) respectively.",2e9ba71c-b1da-433b-a466-a03c44f07ebb
18,methods18," glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH) converts L-glutamate into alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG), a key step in glutamine anaplerosis, whereas GAD1 converts L-glutamate into gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA).  In addition, in 98% mutant cells, several genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were also upregulated, including those which encode citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, as well as most genes that encode succinate dehydrogenase complex and genes belonging to the succinate-CoA ligase family. It should be noted, however, that ME3, encoding the mitochondrial malic enzyme 3 which catalyzes the decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate was found to be downregulated in mutant cells (Table 1).  3.4.",c464d96b-eb1e-4c09-b066-9855de2655a5
19,methods19," Exposure of Cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) Mutation to Ketone Body (KB) Restores the Intracellular Glutamate Level, Improves Mitochondrial Dynamics, and Respiratory Chain Activity  We have previously shown that the mitochondrial function of cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation was improved by the switch from glycolysis to fatty acid β-oxidation induced by the exposure to KB combining acetoacetate and β-D-hydroxybutyrate [21]. We, therefore, investigated the effect on glutamate levels of exposure to KB for 48 h on the 98% mutation load cells.  The exposure to KB resulted in a 48% reduction in the intracellular glutamate level in the 98% mutant cells, whereas the extracellular glutamate concentration remained unchanged, and no variation of intra- or extracellular glutamate levels was observed in the control cells (Figure 4A,B).",521dbe68-206a-4541-bd29-9180b8d8d1da
20,methods20," Similar results on intracellular glutamate levels were obtained with the 143B cybrid mutant cells carrying a 98% mutation load of the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation, whereas KB exposure significantly increased intracellular glutamate levels in 143B control cells (Figure S1A).  As glutamate has been shown to be toxic to neuronal activity and cell growth [34], we evaluated the protective role of KB, after exposing 98% mutant cells to high glutamate concentrations (30–50 µM range). After incubation in a standard medium (SM) or KB, cell proliferation of the 98% mutant cells was measured in the presence or absence of glutamate. Cellular growth of the 98% mutant cells was fully inhibited in the presence of glutamate in SM whereas glutamate did not affect their proliferation in the presence of KB (Figure 4C). We further observed a close inverse correlation between growth rates and intracellular glutamate concentrations.",6293a85e-37ee-470b-94b9-58f986e5faf9
21,methods21,"  In addition to these effects on cell growth, exposure to KB also inhibited cell death induced after 15 h incubation with 30 μM of glutamate (Figure S1B).  We next investigated the toxicity of a high intracellular glutamate concentration on the mitochondrial network dynamics. While the mitochondrial network was highly connected in control cells, it was fragmented in the 98% mutation load untreated cells (Figure 4D,E). Interestingly, KB treatment restored mitochondrial fusion and network elongation in cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation (Figure 4D,E). Conversely, control cells exposed to a high glutamate concentration presented mitochondrial swelling and fragmentation, while further addition of KB restored a connected network, demonstrating that treatment with KB has a protective effect against glutamate toxicity and restores normal mitochondrial dynamics (Figure S1D).  3.5.",4980fde8-5b7b-4ae8-955e-06144f05f20c

This was paralleled with a significant two-fold increase in mitochondrial enzyme activities of complex I and II, related to citrate synthase, in cells treated with KB for 48 h compared to untreated cells (Figure 5C).  3.6.

23,methods23,"3243A > G Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) Variant Affects the Glutamate/gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) Pathways  Based on our gene expression results, the main enzymes involved in glutamate metabolism pathways, downstream of the transformation of glutamine to glutamate by the glutaminase, were investigated. The first pathway consists of generating αKG from glutamate by means of glutamate dehydrogenase (glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH)) [35]) (Figure 6A).",231c8275-f1dc-400d-95b1-dd25623dbe67
24,methods24," The second pathway generates succinate by the successive involvement of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD1), catalysing the decarboxylation of glutamate to gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT)) leading to succinic semialdehyde (succinic semialdehyde (SSA)), and then the succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (succinic semialdehyde (SSA)DH)) leading to succinate, the substrate of complex II (Figure 6A). Importantly, defects in these enzymes are responsible for severe neurometabolic disorders, seizures, intellectual disability, and generalised dystonia [36,37,38].  Gene expression profiling of 98% mutant cells (Figure 3B,C) highlighted the overexpression of GLUD1, which encodes glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH) (Figure 6A and Table 1), prompting us to monitor the conversion of glutamate into αKG by the glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH) enzyme.",b9067af9-a759-4605-b968-7a2f6bb52ddb
25,methods25," A four-fold increase in glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH) activity in 98% mutant cells was observed (Figure 6B), paralleling a concomitant overexpression of the protein (Figure 6(E1,E2)), while the αKG level remained unchanged in both the control and 98% mutant cells (Figure 6C).  Interestingly, glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH) enzyme activity was unchanged by KB exposure, whereas the concentration of αKG, as measured by mass spectrometry, was significantly reduced (71%) in mutant cells exposed to KB (Figure 6C). This suggests that KB stimulates the mitochondrial anaplerotic energy metabolism in mutant cells, providing alternative substrates capable of replenishing the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle [39]. We also observed that the αKG concentration was also increased in KB supplemented control cells (Figure 6C). In addition, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were reduced in both mutant and control cells exposed to KB by 63% and 48%, respectively (Figure 6D).",900679df-168a-4de0-96db-8da5fc3ec990
26,methods26,"  We further assessed the protein expression level of GAD1, aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT), and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH) from the glutamate pathway which revealed that GAD1 and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH) were significantly increased (two-fold) in 98% mutant cells. A normal glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH) expression level was restored by KB exposure in the 98% mutant cells (Figure 6(E1,E2)). Surprisingly, we found that aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT) mRNA expression was completely inhibited in mutant cells and the protein level was undetectable in Western blotting (Figure 6(E1,E2) and Figure S2).  The expression level of aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT) protein was unchanged after treatment with KB in mutant cells (Figure 6(E1,E2)). In addition, we confirmed a drastic increase in GAD1 mRNA in the 98% mutation load compared to the control cells (Figure S2), in line with the GAD1 overexpression seen in the transcriptomic analysis (Table 1, Figure 6(E1,E2)).",e8c38d3d-8242-4fa2-81a0-bc7300c9e734
27,methods27,"  3.7. Dysfunction of the Mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) Cycle in Cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) Mutation Is Alleviated by KB Exposure  The measurements of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) intermediates by mass spectrometry showed that the pyruvate concentration was reduced by 76% in cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation compared to control cells since most of the pyruvate produced during glycolysis was converted into lactate (Figure 7A,B), as expected in mitochondrial dysfunction [24]. Furthermore, citrate concentration was four times higher in the 98% mutation load than in control cells, representing one of the blockade points of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in 98% mutant cells (Figure 7C), while succinate concentration was reduced by more than half in 98% mutant cells compared to control cells (Figure 7E).",1e441773-ad75-4dc3-9a4a-6cd7ca8d3f29
28,methods28," In addition, malate and fumarate concentrations were increased by 319% and 333%, respectively, revealing two additional blocking steps in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related to the reduction in the oxidation of different substrates by the NAD+/NADH ratio (Figure 7F,G). The level of αKG remained unchanged between the control and 98% mutant cells, suggesting that αKG was converted to glutamate via the glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH) bidirectional enzyme, a process also responsible for the glutamate accumulation in mutant cells (Figure 6C and Figure 7D).  Interestingly, KB treatment resulted in both a 88% reduction in pyruvate concentration (Figure 7A) as well as a reduction in lactate production in KB-treated 98% mutant cells, compared to untreated cells, suggesting that glycolysis was reduced (Figure 7B).",da1a2aa1-0536-4d74-9b4b-dc71432b7fa9
29,methods29," Importantly, KB treatment allowed the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to proceed in a more physiological manner, unlocking the various NADH-dependent tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle blockages, like citrate, malate, fumarate, and αKG concentrations were significantly lowered by treatment with KB (Figure 7C,D,F,G), while succinate concentration was increased (Figure 7E). In KB-treated control cells, a 47% reduction of pyruvate was also observed and a 50% increase in αKG, without any other metabolic changes (Figure 7A–D).  3.8.

30,methods30," Higher concentrations of amino acids (Table 2), including glutamine, glutamate, alanine, proline, arginine, histidine, ornithine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and valine were found in the brain with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation compared to control brains. Most of these amino acids contribute to the glutamate pathway, thus their increase strongly suggests that glutamate catabolism was also impaired in the brain tissues with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation.",7e9c73c9-bf0e-45cf-ae96-f50ac1c636c5
31,methods31," Similar to cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation, the concentration of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) was also reduced in the brain, while immunohistochemical studies revealed a reduction in glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH), GAD1, and aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT) staining in the frontal lobe, lentiform nucleus, thalamus plus subthalamic nucleus, and cerebellum areas of the brain when compared to five control brains (Figure 8A–C).  4. Discussion  Clinical presentations of mitochondrial disorders caused by pathogenic mtDNA variants are highly heterogeneous due to the peculiarities of the mitochondrial genome [1]. Moreover, the development of mitochondrial medicine is also greatly impaired by the lack of biomarkers to monitor the disease outcome and by the absence of efficient therapies which can target mitochondria [1].",5ad33dfa-2bc9-4485-ae66-b4ba3fd1f84f
32,methods32," To tackle these restrictions, substantial progress has been made in recent years using OMICS technologies, providing novel insights into disease mechanisms and opportunities to develop therapeutic routes [40,41,42].  The m.3243A > G variant is considered to be one of the most common mtDNA mutations and the consequences of clinical heterogeneity and mutation load are still not well understood [37]. This particular variant is responsible for Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) syndrome or Maternal Inherited Diabetes and Deafness (Maternal Inherited Diabetes and Deafness (MIDD)) as well as other related clinical disorders [6]. Here, we have applied a strategy based on an integrated approach using emerging technologies with the combination of targeted metabolomics and transcriptomics to assess the consequences of the m.",159abbe3-ea83-4352-aac4-403a54f95de7

The main goal was to identify a metabolic signature and relevant pathways, and ultimately to monitor the efficacy of nutritional-based therapy with the use of ketone bodies.  A multi-omic signature of cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation. A specific biochemical signature revealing key biomarkers of the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) syndrome was identified using targeted metabolomics based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and latent variable-based statistical methods.",3ca86c8c-e2f0-40a9-8880-44a0c58f2152
34,methods34," The quantification of 188 metabolites in neuronal cybrid cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation confirmed the significant reduction in arginine and taurine, a result that has already been identified with Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) syndrome, further supporting the therapeutic use of these two key amino acids in patients with Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) with the goal of reducing stroke-like episodes [16,38,39].  In addition, metabolomic results evidenced a significant increase in L-DOPA, alanine, glutamate, and glutamine. L-DOPA accumulation was shown to contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in an in vitro cellular model of Parkinson’s disease [43] whereas increased alanine concentration has been considered to be a hallmark of mitochondrial disorders [1].",13a552cc-73ea-4aae-a759-30a52145654a
35,methods35," However, the most unexpected result of the metabolomic analysis was the drastic increase in glutamate and glutamine in cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation compared to controls.  Glutamate is a key marker of Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) pathophysiology. Glutamate, whose dysregulation is frequently encountered in neurological disorders, is a non-essential amino acid crucial for neurotransmission in the central nervous system [44,45] and glutamate has also a key role to fuel αKG into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) (Figure 9A). Our multi-omic approach highlighted the metabolic dysregulation of the glutamate pathway and established firm correlations between intracellular glutamate level, mitochondrial complex I inhibition, and the m.",bbddc4ac-767b-4886-af02-466ef7e709f4
36,methods36,"3243G>A heteroplasmy level in cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation. These observations were confirmed by the transcriptomic data which revealed the glutamate metabolism ontology to be one of the most affected in cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation, together with the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle pathways. Among these gene clusters, those encoding the key enzymes GAD1 and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH) involved in the glutamate pathway were highly upregulated in mutant cells. This is in line with what we have previously observed in 143B cybrid cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation, further providing evidence for the correlation of the transcriptional reprogramming with the heteroplasmy level [46].",ed288b15-b79f-4330-82c6-2839166fd68c
37,methods37,"  Extracellular glutamate concentrations were also significantly elevated in the supernatant of cybrid neuronal cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation, especially those carrying the 70% and 90% mutation loads, while it was also increased, but to a lower extent, in the 98% mutant cells. This could possibly be explained by an inhibition of glutamate transport in this latter condition, as previously reported [47].  Intermediate metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle are increased in cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation. Our metabolomic results demonstrated an accumulation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates such as citrate, malate, and fumarate, evidencing the blockade of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation.",84e258cd-4e80-45b9-aa42-1d045a374017
38,methods38," Importantly, these substrates were related to NADH oxidation, which is dependent on mitochondrial complex I activity. These results are fully in line with those of a recent clinical study performed in a large cohort of patients with the m.3243A > G variant which evidenced the accumulation in plasma of intermediate metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle which was linked to NAD+-dependent biochemical reactions [42]. The identification of those metabolites related to NADH redox unbalance reflects the disease severity and may be used as biomarkers to follow candidate therapies aimed at reducing NADH reductive stress [48,49]. In addition, in the context of homoplasmic mtDNA mutations, it has been shown that glutamine, the precursor of glutamate, was used within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, leading to the increased synthesis of aspartate [39].",204c00af-0fa7-4be7-9642-5ad7876ed910
39,methods39," Thus, increased amino acid levels, including glutamate levels, are consistent with a compensatory response to the primary Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) of the cells produce ATP through the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) defect [39,50]. A recent study aimed to assess glutamate and glutamine levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) patients showed an elevated glutamate level in the CSF but not in the plasma [51] and in contrast, the CSF glutamine level was lower than controls [51]. These data raise the question of glutamate-glutamine balance in the pathophysiology of Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS).  Mitochondrial dysfunction is alleviated by Ketone Body exposure.",6a6cdbba-4911-4e25-9d03-5d834e9f12f2
40,methods40," To monitor if the toxic impact of a high glutamate concentration could be reduced, cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation were exposed to treatment with KB which led to a switch from a glycolytic metabolism to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Importantly, cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation exposed to KB unlocked the NADH-dependent tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle blockade, restoring a normal tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function and significantly increasing oxidative metabolism (Figure 9B). Indeed, analysis of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle revealed a reduction in citrate, malate, and fumarate metabolites, all dependent on NADH oxidation, thus restoring physiological tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function.",37a712b7-f87f-40b1-b4b6-8d52f92428f4
41,methods41," These results suggest that a ketogenic diet could be beneficial in treating the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) disease, as already proposed for other mitochondrial diseases and for drug-resistant epilepsy [20,22,23]. Further in vitro test results have been recently obtained in our laboratory which demonstrates that KB exposure over a period of 4 weeks significantly alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction in cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation by improving complex I assembly and activity [21]. KB has also been shown to reduce the percentage of deleted mtDNA molecules in cells with large-scale heteroplasmic deletions after only 5 days of exposure [52].",ffd6cdba-db91-4a54-9962-c74154d6e77f
42,methods42," Other studies have also demonstrated that treatment of SH-SY5Y parental cells or complex I deficient cells with decanoic acid, a component of the medium chain triglyceride form of the ketogenic diet, improve mitochondrial functions [53,54].  In addition, KB exposure reduced the accumulation of glutamate in cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation (Figure 9B), while increasing αKG concentration, suggesting that this latter metabolite is an important marker of anaplerotic energy metabolism [39]. αKG also plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of other mitochondrial disorders and in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, which is most probably related to the reduction of the αKG dehydrogenase complex, as evidenced in age-related neurodegenerative disorders [55].",286d9e6a-8a33-4dd9-8fe2-ea02bdd51942
43,methods43, Perturbations of the glutamine/glutamate/αKG metabolic axis were also found in the Ndufs4 KO mouse model of Leigh syndrome while being rescued by mTOR inhibition with rapamycin [56]. This latter study also highlighted that αKG is a complex I substrate that supports oxidative phosphorylation [56].  The level of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is significantly reduced in neuronal cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation as well as in post-mortem brain tissue.,b235c035-badb-44e9-8ddc-fff8f4374d35
44,methods44," In parallel with the accumulation of other amino acids such as glutamate, we observed a significant reduction in gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) in neuronal cells with the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) mutation without changing the expression level of aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT) that was confirmed in brain tissue obtained from a patient with Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS). Mitochondrial dysfunction affects the storage, release, or uptake mechanisms of neurotransmitters including glutamate and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) [57]. This is in line with the high prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in patients with Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) [58]. The uptake of glutamate and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) in synaptosomal preparations from mouse brains was also decreased by rotenone, dependent on the dose [59].",1b8910e3-8a41-44b1-a41c-32c69e130c03
45,methods45," Interestingly, it was recently demonstrated that the regulation of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) availability and signalling was strongly connected with mitochondrial alterations which in turn modulates neuronal communication and social behaviour [60]. Of note, aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT) variants were also responsible for encephalomyopathies with a neurometabolic disorder of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) degradation resulting in an elevated gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain as well as mtDNA depletion syndrome highlighting aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT) as an enzyme of dual function [61].  As shown in our study, the ketogenic diet appears to be a promising strategy for modulating mitochondrial function, and eventually mitochondrial biogenesis [21,62]. New imaging technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography may be used to monitor the disease outcome following key metabolic biomarkers during KB treatment [63].",4256652d-d122-45e2-94b9-b3dcfbcaaa7b
46,methods46," In this respect, an open-label, non-randomised clinical trial based on treatment with bezafibrate, a molecule known to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, was recently evaluated on a limited number of patients carrying the m.3243A > G mutation [64]. The results revealed an alteration of glutamine metabolism with a significant increase in several amino acids including alanine and glutamate which is thought to be part of a compensatory response to the of the cells produce ATP through the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) defect in the context of mtDNA mutation [40,48].  5.",3bad9093-4dc2-40ed-bf46-39e4662c4088
47,methods47," Conclusions  This work highlights the usefulness of a multi-omic strategy and significantly improves our understanding of the contribution of glutamate metabolism to the Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) pathophysiology, promoting glutamate as a potential biomarker of severity for Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) syndrome but also demonstrating the consequences of an NADH/ NAD+ redox imbalance. Metabolic interventions such as a ketogenic diet should be considered a promising therapeutic route to help reduce glutamate toxicity, alleviating the blockades of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle by reducing NADH reductive stress due to complex I deficiency in Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis Syndrome Stroke Like Episodes (MELAS) syndrome.
