0,background0,"Dietary proteins and interventions have been proposed to affect Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms through the gut-brain axis.  Panksepp (55) observed that behavior induced by low doses of narcotics resembled Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) behaviors, and proposed an excessive or unusual activity in endogenous brain opioid systems of children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Subsequently, an opioid-excess theory of autism was proposed. According to this theory, in individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), peptides with opioid activity are formed from dietary sources, especially from those containing gluten and casein. These peptides pass through an abnormally permeable gut membrane and enter the central nervous system to influence neurotransmission and other physiological symptoms (56).  The underlying microbiota-gut-brain axis mechanisms of GF/CF diets have also been related to the premises of the opioid-excess theory (57).",1bd91708-d28b-4db6-a86d-78dd2b533ed8
1,background1," The increased endogenous opioids in the body fluids of individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been connected to altered activity in Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) of the DPP4 enzyme, which is able to decrease endogenous and exogenous opioid peptide levels in the blood (58). These excessive amounts of opioid peptides are suggested to pass the blood-brain barrier, bind to opioid receptors, and result in Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms. As gluten and casein are the precursors for these opioid peptides, removing them is proposed to improve Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms by positively influencing neurotransmission in the brain either directly or indirectly (58).  However, it is not clear whether this mechanism is at work in all individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",db9c0cff-6688-481e-b916-f41a4e4e2944
2,background2," This idea is supported by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial administering a digestive enzyme supplement, which did not find any significant clinical improvement of Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms (59). This suggests that not all individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have abnormal digestion of gluten and casein leading to opioid peptides. Similarly, children who responded to a GF/CF diet were observed to give a heightened immune response to cow milk protein and/or gliadin (60). So, it is possible that not all individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have digestive problems with or immune reactivity to cow milk protein and gliadin. Therefore, individual measurements should be taken before recommending a GF/CF diet, which may not provide any behavioral benefits for some individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and even be another negative factor aggravating social isolation (12).",ed9e6765-de89-49cc-9bb1-db978ed3c174
3,background3,"  Besides the elevated inflammatory reaction to dietary proteins observed in some individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it was also found that a subgroup of children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) produce antibodies against gliadin peptides and Purkinje cells (61). This finding is important for two reasons. First, it supports the existence a subgroup, and not all measured individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), to have an immune reaction to gluten and gliadin, and it does so via another measurement besides pro-inflammatory cytokines, that of antibodies. Such antibody production may be another reason why GF/CF diets resulted in behavioral improvements for some Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients but not all of them. This finding attests once more to the need for individualized dietary treatment regimens for Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",7f6bf600-7d37-45c5-90af-99f9902b3b74
4,background4," Secondly, the finding of a significant percentage of children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) showing elevated antibodies against not only gliadin but also cerebellar peptides suggests that the aberrant immunoreactivity in some individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may not be limited to dietary proteins. Though the authors of this study suggest that these responses may be responsible for some neurological symptoms in Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the mechanism behind this and how such autoimmunoreactivity relates to aberrant immune reactions to dietary elements was not revealed until very recently.  Though it was not specifically tested in individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the very recent investigation into the similarities between dietary and human aquaporins may connect findings about dietary protein reactivity and autoimmunity in Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",3d563a36-127e-4a2b-a582-f415ca066d31
5,background5," Aquaporins are membrane channel proteins that are found in plants and humans, including the gut barrier and the blood-brain barrier. Lambert et al. (4) showed that because of the shared structural homology between plant and human aquaporins, antibody immune reactions against food aquaporins can lead to neuroautoimmune reactivity. An already impaired intestinal barrier such as that suggested for Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or a compromised gastrointestinal barrier due to reactivity with aquaporins in the gut barrier would allow antigenic material from foods and gut bacteria into the blood. Excessive antibody formation to these products may then trigger systemic inflammation and autoimmune reactivity, which may in turn affect the blood-brain barrier integrity, allowing circulating antibodies to enter the brain and target neurological tissues that resemble the antibody's target food antigen (4).",c9318273-dd9d-437c-af0d-b81063bad6b0
6,background6," As authors suggest that this environmentally induced neuroautoimmunity begins with genetic susceptibility for neurological disorders, this may be one model to connect genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers in Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the pathway underlying the previously mentioned finding of elevated antibodies against gluten and cerebellar cells in a group of children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  From Evidence to Treatment Two suggestions come from abovementioned researchers that can help guide the creation of personalized treatments for Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Jyonouchi et al.",12928604-1175-4d1c-9707-3473f2177d74
7,background7," (60), upon discovering that the subgroup of Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children who clinically responded to GF/CF diet had an increased production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-Î± with cow milk protein and/or gliadin, suggest that these responses to dietary proteins may be a simple, objective marker to assess the presence of dietary protein intolerance in children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Lambert et al. (4) propose that practitioners working with patients with neurological conditions should test for food aquaporin reactivity, and if they obtain a positive result, should remove the offending foods, which may ameliorate the patient's clinical condition.  These dietary recommendations may nicely combine with prebiotic and probiotic components.",16acefd5-6c0d-4f37-bd51-5eb396449fa0
8,background8," One group who found increased mycotoxin levels in individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and especially of the mycotoxin Ochratoxin A (Ochratoxin A (OTA)) suggested a personalized diet coupled with probiotics for Ochratoxin A (OTA)-positive individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (62). Another group combined an exclusion diet with prebiotics. Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients that are fermented by probiotics, resulting in health benefits to the host by selectively stimulating these beneficial bacteria and in the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that can diffuse into the blood, enabling a distal effect on numerous body organs (63).",4818b65b-1c05-4102-8e48-1c06cf249f54
9,background9," As the administration of prebiotics and an exclusion diet resulted in improvements in social behavior, gut microbiota, and metabolites in children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the authors propose that multiple interventions, such as their combination, may be more relevant to improve both physiological and psychological traits in Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (64).  Taking these novel findings and recommendations by researchers into account, I present a personalized dietary treatment regimen based on the gut-immune-endocrine-brain axis and the specific immune reactivity and gut microbial profile of each individual on the autism spectrum.  This proposed personalized treatment comprises the following three steps (Figure 1).  Figure 1 Steps for the creation, implementation, and evaluation of the proposed personalized dietary treatment regimen for individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",73d28ee1-774e-4c9c-a103-ad810bb37ce6
10,background10,"  Step 1: Screening  Screen for inflammatory response to milk and wheat proteins [see procedure by Jyonouchi et al. (60)]  Screen for reactivity to dietary aquaporins including but not limited to milk and wheat [see procedure by Lambert et al. (4)]  Perform fecal or another mapping of gut bacterial profile.  This preliminary proposition focused on milk and gluten proteins, since the currently available evidence suggests them to be the peptides against which children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show higher levels of immunoglobulin antibodies (61, 65). In children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the antibodies against milk and gliadin peptides of gluten react with cerebellar peptides, which is not the case for antibodies for corn and soy, pointing to the significant antigenic cross-reactivity of gluten and milk with cerebellar antigens (61, 65).",47e363da-2937-425f-8ef3-03a390408611
11,background11," If future studies reveal similar antigenic cross-reactivity effects or increased immunoglobulin levels in individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) for other dietary proteins, they can also be included in the screening process.  Step 2: Implementation  Create a patient-specific dietary restriction plan based on inflammatory and aquaporin reactivity results from the screening.  Complement with prebiotic supplements [the most common prebiotics are Fructo-oligosaccharides (Fructo oligosaccharides (FOS)), galacto-oligosaccharides (galacto oligosaccharides (GOS)), and trans-galacto-oligosaccharides (trans galacto oligosaccharides (TOS)) (63)] and targeted probiotic strains that address the microbial imbalance in the gut [see procedures by Tomova et al. (49) and Shaaban et al. (50)].",8c1f66be-40f8-4dfa-877c-63900a1f00bb
12,background12,"  Though two studies normalized altered gut microbiota in individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using probiotic supplements, a complete mapping of the effects of these used and other probiotics should be done before administration or recommendation. Through the ingestion of appropriate probiotic strains or prebiotic growth substrates for the beneficial bacteria (63), gut microbial imbalance in individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be restored.  Here, the focus should be on correcting altered levels of gut microbial strains that produce critical SCFAs, such as butyrate, which is recently implicated in the mechanism of non-allergic gluten/wheat sensitivity via its effects on a chain reaction of events in the gut (66).",967a0e15-0262-49fd-b043-eb920884be53
13,background13," The results of future investigations along these lines in individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may necessitate the addition of screening for the levels of important SCFA-producing gut bacteria to Step 1 in the forthcoming refinements of the present proposal.  When creating the probiotic and prebiotic cocktail, attention should be paid to the recently published reiteration that in order to be considered probiotic, microbial strain designation and at least one human study are needed (52). Additionally, if a strain is shown to be effective for a certain function, such as improving the gut barrier, then that strain is expected to confer the same benefit when administered in the presence of other strains, at its previously tested dose (52). This notion supports the utilization of more than one probiotic strain in this cocktail depending on the specific needs of the individual.",22c8c538-9950-4c90-9bf9-a4bf0cfcd3e6
14,background14,"  Step 3: Evaluation  Test for the gut microbial, gut and blood-brain barrier-related, and inflammatory changes in individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) via measurements before and after treatment.  Observe differences in repetitive/restrictive behaviors, communication, and sociability in individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using measurements as Childhood Autism Rating Scale (Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)), Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)), and Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC)).  It should be noted that this is a preliminary description of this novel personalized dietary treatment approach to Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Its aim lies more in the dissemination of this perspective than in the creation of a solid protocol, which will hopefully be the next step.",1c8a5459-838c-4a91-bf63-91674bdcf025
15,background15," Following investigations will evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of such personalized screenings and the resulting dietary regimens for individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) of all ages, both sexes, and different levels of condition severity.  Conclusion This perspective article translates the current emphasis on the gut-brain axis and appeal for personalized interventions into a feasible step-by-step application to create personalized dietary treatments for individuals with autism. By following a more integrated gut-immune-endocrine-brain axis model, it explains why and how to formulate an individualized dietary plan that matches the specific inflammatory and aquaporin reactivity responses of each individual with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",701386a3-8f52-40b4-a166-0525f08aaf34
16,background16," This way, individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can avoid the harmful gut microbial, gastrointestinal, and metabolic effects of GF/CF and ketogenic diets delineated previously (16) and receive targeted treatments for their specific physiological profiles. More investigations into the full spectrum of effect of particular probiotics and prebiotics will help flesh out a protocol to include specific recommendations for individuals based on their personal needs. This next step of nutritional neuropsychopharmacology (67) is what will enable the formulation of patient-specific treatment regimens with utmost effectiveness and minimal side effects for individuals with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
