CREBH is activated in fatty livers and promotes fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 production. fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 suppresses lipolysis, alleviating mobilization of TG from adipose tissue to the liver. CREBH also induces apoA-IV, apoA-V and apoC-II that stimulate LPL-mediated TG clearance. Loss of CREBH causes hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia. =",f418572a-2633-48cf-afa8-5e30dfdd77ef
14,results0,"CREBH deficiency increases hepatic TG due to increased adipose tissue lipolysis CREBH deficient (Creb3l3−/−) mice fed normal chow diet exhibited increased plasma and hepatic TG levels compared with WT mice, when measured after a 16 h fast (Fig. 1A,B). Oil red O staining of frozen liver sections also showed higher amount of neutral lipids in Creb3l3−/− hepatocytes than in WT controls (Fig. 1C). In contrast, plasma and hepatic TG levels in the fed state were not significantly different between WT and Creb3l3−/− mice (Fig. 1A–C).  To determine the cause of severe fasting-induced hepatic steatosis in Creb3l3−/− mice, we first asked whether adipose tissue lipolysis was increased in these mice. Prolonged fasting increased plasma glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels in both WT and Creb3l3−/− mice, indicating enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis during nutrient scarcity.",00703aad-de1f-4fe1-82c0-e8ca7219145d
15,results1," Interestingly, Creb3l3−/− mice exhibited significantly higher fasting plasma glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels than the WT mice (Fig. 1D,E), suggesting that the loss of CREBH further increased adipose tissue lipolysis. Consistent with this, hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) phosphorylation at protein kinase A (PKA) sites (Ser-563 and Ser-660) in WAT was significantly increased in Creb3l3−/− compared to the WT mice in the fasted state33 (Fig. 1F,G, Supplementary Fig. 1A). Perilipin phosphorylation as revealed by the band shift in western blot34 was also increased in Creb3l3−/− compared to WT mice (Fig. 1F, Supplementary Fig. 1A). adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) abundance tended to be higher in Creb3l3−/− WAT than in WT controls (Fig. 1F, Supplementary Fig. 1A), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Insulin is a critical regulator of adipose tissue lipolysis, suppressing lipase activity through the Akt kinase-PKA pathway35.",4c033c66-ebcc-4360-8555-f318dfa373a7
16,results2," Fasting decreased plasma insulin and glucose levels in both WT and Creb3l3−/− mice to similar degrees (Fig. 1H,I). Creb3l3−/− mice exhibited a modestly improved glucose tolerance (Fig. 1J), excluding the possibility that the increased lipolysis in Creb3l3−/− mice might be due to low insulin level or compromised insulin action. These data suggest that CREBH regulates adipose tissue lipolysis in an insulin-independent manner.  We next investigated whether de novo lipogenesis, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion rate, fatty acids oxidation, and ketogenesis were altered in Creb3l3−/− mice, contributing to the increased hepatic steatosis. We found comparable expression of major lipogenic transcription factors, Srebf1, Srebf2, and ChREBP, and their target genes, such as Fasn, Acacb, and Scd1 between WT and Creb3l3−/− mice in the fed state (Fig. 2A).",2fe076e0-2185-4439-a867-29d988a83c5f
17,results3," Srebf1 and its target genes were markedly downregulated by fasting in both WT and Creb3l3−/− mice, likely reflecting normal insulin-mediated regulation of these genes. In contrast, fasting-induced expression of Apoa4, a representative CREBH target gene was markedly downregulated in Creb3l3−/− liver (Supplementary Fig. 1B), consistent with previous report23. Furthermore, overexpression of the constitutively active CREBH(N) had no effect on TG synthesis in primary mouse hepatocytes using glycerol and oleic acid as substrates (Supplementary Fig. 1C), suggesting that CREBH has minimal role in lipogenesis. The scavenger receptor CD36 involved in fatty acid uptake was similarly expressed between WT and Creb3l3−/− livers (Supplementary Fig. 1B). The abundance of PPARα, the central transcriptional regulator of fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, was comparable between WT and Creb3l3−/− livers (Fig. 2B).",8e4f7277-d0c1-41f2-8b04-6a0d658c73ed
18,results4," Consistently, mRNA levels of PPARα target genes, such as Acox1, Cpt2, Hmgcs2, Hadh, Acadm, and Acadl were similar between WT and Creb3l3−/− livers, except Cpt1a which appeared to be regulated by both CREBH and PPARα (Fig. 2C). Western blotting also confirmed normal expression of Hmgcs2 protein, the rate-limiting enzyme for ketogenesis, in Creb3l3−/− liver (Supplementary Fig. 1D). Importantly, fatty acid oxidation capacity was comparable between WT and Creb3l3−/− liver lysates (Fig. 2D). Creb3l3−/− mice exhibited slightly higher fasting plasma ketone levels compared with the WT mice, likely reflecting the increased flow of fatty acids to the liver to serve as ketogenic substrates (Fig. 2E). Consistent with this scenario, in vitro ketone production rate was comparable between WT and Creb3l3−/− primary hepatocytes, when octanoic acids were provided as substrate (Supplementary Fig. 1E).",87214661-2ee1-4595-916d-7637ce7983a2
19,results5," Similarly, overexpression of CREBH(N) had no effect on ketone production in primary hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig. 1F). Finally, there was no noticeable difference in the hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG production rate between WT and Creb3l3−/− mice (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these data suggest that the severe fasting-induced hepatic steatosis in Creb3l3−/− mice is primarily due to increased adipose tissue lipolysis, whereas de novo lipogenesis, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) production, and fatty acid oxidation were unaffected in Creb3l3−/− mice.  Severe hepatic steatosis of CREBH deficient mice on ketogenic diet High-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) has metabolic effects similar to fasting, shifting the energy source from carbohydrates to fatty acids, which are oxidized in the liver to produce ketone bodies36. We tested whether, similarly to fasting, the KD caused severe steatosis in Creb3l3−/− mice.",3936581f-ce40-42a6-852f-c3d6da29d54a
20,results6," KD caused mild steatosis in WT mice, as determined by oil red O staining of the liver sections and biochemical quantification of hepatic TG and cholesterol contents (Fig. 3A–C). In stark contrast, Creb3l3−/− mice exhibited a dramatic increase in hepatic TG level compared with the WT mice (Fig. 3B). Hepatic cholesterol levels were modestly increased in Creb3l3−/− mice (Fig. 3C). H&E staining confirmed the presence of ballooned hepatocytes with pale cytoplasm in Creb3l3−/− mice, a distinctive feature of hepatic steatosis (Supplementary Fig. 2A). KD also induced hepatomegaly in Creb3l3−/− mice, resulting in a more than 60% increase in liver to body weight ratio (Fig. 3D,E). Creb3l3−/− mice lost more body weight than the WT on KD (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Body weight loss correlated well with the reduced fat mass (Supplementary Fig. 2C). KD dramatically increased plasma glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels in Creb3l3−/−, but not in WT mice (Fig. 3F,G).",7573a5cc-a1b7-4395-930f-3de8e6c14a29
21,results7," Creb3l3−/− mice also exhibited increased hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin phosphorylation, and increased adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) abundance in WAT compared with the WT controls (Fig. 3H), indicating that CREBH deficiency led to dysregulated adipose tissue lipolysis. Plasma TG and ketone body levels measured in the fed state were also markedly higher in Creb3l3−/− than in WT mice on KD (Fig. 3I,J). Interestingly, the expression of PPARα and its target genes was impaired in Creb3l3−/− mice on KD (Supplementary Fig. 2D,E), which might have contributed to the severe steatosis phenotype of these mice. The underlying mechanism for the reduced expression of PPARα in CREBH deficient liver remains to be determined. Lipogenic transcription factors and enzymes were unchanged in Creb3l3−/− mice as compared with WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 2F).  Hepatic steatosis often progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with associated liver damage, fibrosis, and inflammation.",9da3b061-b715-451b-8e71-fe99289daa1a
22,results8," We next investigated whether the severe hepatic steatosis in Creb3l3−/− mice on KD progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). KD caused a marked increase in plasma aminotransferase (ALT) levels in Creb3l3−/− mice, indicating the presence of liver damage (Fig. 4A). Trichrome staining of the liver sections revealed a pronounced deposition of collagen in the liver of Creb3l3−/− mice (Fig. 4B). Infiltration of inflammatory cells was also observed in the liver of Creb3l3−/− mice fed KD (Fig. 4C). Consistent with these histological observations, liver fibrosis-related genes such as Col1a1, TGF-beta1 and Acta2, and inflammatory genes such as MCP-1, KC, MIP-1α, CD11c and F4/80, were highly induced Creb3l3−/− mice (Fig. 4D,E). These data suggest that CREBH deficient mice are highly susceptible to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) on KD.",d59efdf3-e6c1-4b43-9bb6-5a6a62a4cb08
23,results9,"  CREBH-induced fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 suppresses lipolysis in adipose tissue We next asked how liver-expressed CREBH regulates adipose tissue lipolysis. We reasoned that CREBH might induce a secretory protein(s) that acts on adipocytes to suppress lipolysis. An obvious candidate for this was fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21, which has been identified as a direct CREBH-target and possesses an anti-lipolytic function313237. In addition, we found that hepatic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 expression was highly increased in various animal models of steatosis, consistent with previous reports383940. Remarkably, there was a strong correlation between hepatic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 mRNA and hepatic TG levels, suggesting that hepatic TG content determines fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 transcription (Fig. 5A).",bc3093f2-113a-4163-91dd-37ab98554652
24,results10," Given that CREBH is activated in fatty livers23, we hypothesized that fatty livers produce fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 via CREBH to suppress lipolysis of adipose tissue, constituting a negative regulatory feedback loop. To test the hypothesis, we first measured hepatic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 mRNA and plasma fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 protein levels in WT and Creb3l3−/− mice. Consistent with previous reports1718, hepatic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 expression was strongly induced by fasting in WT, but not in Creb3l3−/− mice (Fig. 5B). Plasma fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 protein level was also marked lower in Creb3l3−/− than in WT mice (Fig. 5C). KD-induced fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 expression was also markedly diminished in Creb3l3−/− mice, indicating a major role of CREBH in hepatic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 expression (Fig. 5D,E).",8a0806b5-8e04-4135-8501-6137ea8b2ae1
25,results11," Deletion of both CREBH and PPARα in mice almost completely abolished fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 expression induced by fasting (Supplementary Fig. 3A,B), and KD feeding (Supplementary Fig. 3C,D), suggesting that these two transcription factors cooperatively regulate fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 transcription in the liver.  We next tested whether fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 suppressed lipolysis in an ex vivo lipolysis assay. We produced fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 in primary mouse hepatocytes by infecting cells with recombinant adenoviruses expressing human fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 or CREBH(N), which would induce endogenous fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 (Fig. 5F). The conditioned media containing fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 were tested for the effects on the rate of glycerol release from adipose tissue slices freshly isolated from overnight fasted mice.",a478f2cb-008b-4703-9809-f0cf1eff1d5f
26,results12," Conditioned media from CREBH(N) adenovirus-infected cells containing a moderate level of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 modestly suppressed the glycerol release (Fig. 5G). A high dose of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 in the conditioned media from fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 adenovirus-infected cells further suppressed glycerol release, suggesting that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 suppresses adipose tissue lipolysis (Fig. 5G). Glycerol release from isoproterenol-stimulated cells was also reduced by fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21-containing culture supernatant, suggesting that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 suppressed β-adrenergic stimulated lipolysis (Fig. 5G).  We next tested whether fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 overexpression ameliorates hepatic steatosis of Creb3l3−/− mice. We injected recombinant adenovirus expressing human fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 (Ad.hfibroblast growth factor (FGF)21) into Creb3l3−/− mice (Fig.",15ccd7be-ba1e-4d3f-bc07-35b121954cdd
27,results13," 6A), which were then placed on KD 2 days after the viral transduction. fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 overexpression markedly decreased plasma glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels in Creb3l3−/− mice fed KD (Fig. 6B,C), indicating that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 inhibited lipolysis. hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin phosphorylation was also reduced by fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 adenovirus in the WAT of Creb3l3−/− mice (Fig. 6D). Hepatic steatosis was improved by fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 overexpression in Creb3l3−/− mice, as determined by decreased hepatic TG content and liver size (Fig. 6E,F and Supplementary Fig. 4A). fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 also improved the hypertriglyceridemia of Creb3l3−/− mice on KD (Fig. 6G). Interestingly, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 overexpression partially restored the expression of PPARα and its target genes, Acox1, Hmgcs2 and Cpt1a in Creb3l3−/− mice (Supplementary Fig.",9b67a029-1598-4182-9d34-5a8cccd74b68
28,results14," 4B,C), which might have helped to improve the hepatic steatosis. Finally, we analyzed whether fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 overexpression ameliorated hepatic fibrosis and inflammation of Creb3l3−/− mice fed KD. Plasma aminotransferase (ALT) levels were significantly reduced in Ad.hfibroblast growth factor (FGF)21-injected mice compared with Ad.GFP group (Fig. 6H). Additionally, expression of the inflammatory markers such as Col1al, Acta2, MCP-1, MIP-1α and CD11c, were also reduced by fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 overexpression (Fig. 6I). These data suggest that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 is a critical CREBH target that protects against heaptic steatosis and steatohepatitis. ",f726cc1d-fb75-4a55-89ec-86409b7c88c6
29,discussion0,"In this study, we demonstrate that CREBH is activated by TG accumulation in the liver and induces fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21, which suppresses lipolysis in adipose tissue, thereby limiting nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) flow to the liver (Fig. 7). Impairment of the CREBH-fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 axis causes severe steatosis owing to the uncontrolled nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) flow to the liver in fasted or KD-fed mice. We propose that CREBH acts as a TG rheostat in the liver regulating the flow of fatty acids to the liver. We also show that CREBH deficient mice are susceptible to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), identifying CREBH as a potential target for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) prevention and treatment.  It has been previously reported that CREBH deficient mice are susceptible to hepatic steatosis, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear1724.",4c1f2bb4-8622-4da4-8cfe-844cbf2fe8f8
30,discussion1," Zhang and colleagues demonstrated that Creb3l3−/− mice fed atherogenic Paigen diet high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and cholate developed severe hepatic steatosis, associated with decreased expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, cholesterol synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and lipoprotein metabolism24. However, it was unclear whether the alteration of hepatic gene expression profile by the loss of CREBH had a causal role in steatosis, or merely represented a consequence of severe steatosis. For example, it is unlikely that decreased expression of lipogenic transcription factors and enzymes contributed to severe steatosis in Creb3l3−/− mice. In the current study, we systematically explored the mechanisms by which CREBH regulates hepatic TG content, and demonstrated that the increased nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) delivery from adipose tissue to the liver is primarily responsible for the worsened hepatic steatosis in Creb3l3−/− mice. Intriguingly, Zhang et al.",580b47ab-0e6a-4c2a-a8fd-1805685ebc71
31,discussion2,"24 showed that fasting plasma ketone levels were lower in Creb3l3−/− than in WT mice, arguing that fatty acid oxidation was impaired in Creb3l3−/− mice. This is in stark contrast to our findings: increased plasma ketone levels in fasted or KD-fed Creb3l3−/− mice compared with WT controls, and comparable fatty acid oxidation activity in liver lysates between the two groups. Currently, we have no explanation for this discrepancy, as both studies used the same strain of Creb3l3−/− mice41. Notably, a recent independent study showed that Creb3l3−/− mice had higher ketone levels during starvation compared with the WT controls42, consistent with our observations. We speculate that the increased flow of fatty acids from WAT to the liver provides more substrate for ketogenesis, increasing plasma ketone levels in Creb3l3−/− mice.  fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 confers multiple metabolic benefits, which include improving hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and obesity43.",dee66b8c-d317-4f02-82e6-5f44c44af342
32,discussion3," Growing evidence suggests that WAT is a critical target organ responsible for these diverse metabolic effects of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21444546. In the current study, we demonstrated that loss of CREBH decreased fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 production from the liver, increased adipose tissue lipolysis and worsened hepatic steatosis, which was partially reversed by adenoviral overexpression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21. We also showed that in vitro fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 suppressed lipolysis in mouse adipose tissue explants freshly prepared from overnight fasted mice, suggesting that CREBH-induced fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 suppressed adipose tissue lipolysis to ameliorate hepatic steatosis. It should be noted, however, that the effects of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 on adipose tissue lipolysis is rather complex.",f457b161-4f4d-4a8c-8031-76bfe22f6110
33,discussion4," An early study showed that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 increased basal, but not isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes47, whereas a subsequent study found no effect of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 on basal lipolysis under similar experimental conditions37. In contrast, recent studies showed that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 suppressed hormone-stimulated lipolysis in both 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes3748. fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 knockout mice exhibited elevated plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels in fated state31, suggesting increased adipose tissue lipolysis in the absence of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21, which is consistent with our findings in Creb3l3−/− mice. In contrast, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 injection lowered plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) in mice, supporting the role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 in the inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis4849.",f49ded15-d29d-4765-9c34-9fd1a27d89c3
34,discussion5," Interestingly, a recent paper proposed that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 stimulates the flow of fatty acids into adipose tissues, resulting in the reduction of plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels49.  fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 exerts its biological activity through interaction with a cell surface receptor complex consisting of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)1R1c and β-Klotho4550515253. fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor activation triggers various intracellular signaling pathways, but the specific pathways activated by fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 remains poorly understood5455. Creb3l3−/− mice exhibited higher hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin phosphorylation, suggesting that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 signaling intersects with PKA pathway. Further study will address intracellular signaling pathways triggered by fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 in adipocytes.",8208ee96-2f68-4d7a-8a01-66007cf53500
35,discussion6,"  Several transcription factors have been implicated in hepatic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 expression56, among which PPARα and CREBH appear to play the major role. Loss of PPARα or CREBH almost completely abolished fasting-induced hepatic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 expression in mice17183847. Similarly, the loss of either PPARα or CREBH markedly reduced the induction of hepatic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 by KD, although to lesser degrees than by fasting. Concomitant deletion of PPARα and CREBH further reduced hepatic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 expression in KD-fed mice, indicating that PPARα and CREBH cooperatively regulate fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 expression. Consistent with this, a recent study has shown that PPARα and CREBH form a complex that directly binds to fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 promoter18. The interplay between CREBH and PPARα in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 remains to be further elucidated.",b5d335e6-5be8-45f9-9171-713273736654
36,discussion7,"  The liver is the major source of circulating fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 in mice25. Early studies in mice revealed that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 is induced by nutrient deprivation384757, however, the effect of prolonged fasting on serum fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 protein level in humans is relatively small5859. On the other hand, several studies including ours have demonstrated that hepatic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 mRNA and serum fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 protein levels are increased in mice and humans with obesity and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)383940, suggesting that TG accumulation may trigger fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 expression in the liver. TG accumulation activates CREBH in the liver23, which may in turn stimulate fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 transcription.",76b050da-d26f-498f-b66d-c50e464c9318
37,discussion8," In line with this, a recent paper demonstrated that adipose tissue specific CGI-58 knockout mice are protected from fasting-induced hepatic steatosis due to decreased nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) delivery to the liver, which led to impaired CREBH activation and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 expression60. Given that prolonged fasting also induces hepatic steatosis, it is tempting to speculate that the TG accumulation underlies fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 expression in fasted mice.  While high concentration of fatty acid ligands in steatotic livers is expected to activate PPARα, it remains unclear how TG accumulation activates CREBH. CREBH mRNA and the nuclear CREBH(N) protein levels are induced in steatotic livers23. PPARα appears to play a role in the transcriptional activation CREBH in fatty livers21. Since CREBH has to undergo proteolytic cleavage by Golgi proteases for its activation, ER to Golgi transport of CREBH is expected to be a critical regulatory checkpoint.",52827fe1-f899-4b4c-b4d0-34a4ea4c0389
38,discussion9," We speculate that the Golgi transport of CREBH might be coupled with TG accumulation or very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-apolipoprotein B production in the cell. Given that ER transmembrane transcription factors are associated with specific interacting proteins that regulate the Golgi transport6162, it is tempting to speculate that CREBH might also be associated with a yet-to-be identified interaction partner that senses cellular TG level.  The two-hit hypothesis is widely accepted as a mechanism for the progression of simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which involves oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response in the liver as second hits63. KD caused severe hepatocyte death, fibrosis and inflammation in CREBH deficient mice.",9a7adcac-d50e-483e-9d42-aa710b49d919
39,discussion10," Interestingly, overexpression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 ameliorated hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) symptoms of KD-fed Creb3l3−/− mice, suggesting that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 is one of the major CREBH targets that help alleviate steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Another notable CREBH target that might be involved in lipotoxicity is Fsp27β, which promotes the storage of TG in lipid droplets in hepatocytes, and therefore is expected to reduce lipotoxicity64. We speculate that the impaired expression of Fsp27β in CREBH deficient mice might dsiturb TG storage in lipid droplets, exacerbating lipotoxicity and liver danage. Further studies should reveal the contributions of additional CREBH target genes to Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
