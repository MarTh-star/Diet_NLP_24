0,background0,"Epilepsy, defined by the disposition to having seizures, is the most common chronic neurological disease in humans and dogs [1, 2]. Within the UK alone, epidemiological studies have revealed that an estimated 0.6% of dogs are affected by idiopathic epilepsy (IE) [3]. Epilepsy is a major risk to health and welfare in dogs. This neurological disorder has been associated with physical, cognitive and neurobehavioural comorbidities and increased risk of premature death [4].  Currently, pharmacotherapy with seizure suppressing drugs (“anti-epileptic drugs ”or “anti-seizure drugs” (ASD)) represents the most important form of treatment in veterinary medicine. Epileptic patients are usually treated on a chronic, often life-long basis [4]. However, permanent ASD administration is characterised by determining the fine balance between benefits and disadvantages of ASDs.",22473b46-0b75-4e8e-bcf8-737974963e26
1,background1," The seizure-suppressing effects of ASDs might be outweighed by unfavourable side effects including polyphagia, polydipsia, polyuria, restlessness, lethargy or ataxia [5]. Owners of dogs with IE are often worried about the level of sedation and ataxia induced by ASDs, their dog’s seizure frequency, and polypharmacy affecting their own and their pets’ quality of life (QoL) [6].  Furthermore, despite well-established ASD therapies, over two thirds of dogs with epilepsy continue to experience seizures in the long-term and fail to achieve total epilepsy control [7–9]. Up to 30% of these dogs treated with two or more ASDs continue to experience seizures with a less than 50% reduction in seizure frequency [8, 10–12]. This emphasises the need for new therapeutic interventions to improve the QoL of dogs with IE [7, 13–15].",dcda420d-fdb1-4101-9312-9b9343d4683c
2,background2,"  Various diets, especially ketogenic diets (KD), have been shown to reduce frequency and severity of seizures in humans with epilepsy and in rodent models of epilepsy [14, 16–21]. Lifestyle variables, such as the diet of dogs with IE, have also been recognised both anecdotally and in published literature as having an impact upon seizure activity and behaviour [22–25]. For example, a trial of eight dogs with epilepsy treated with an exclusion diet was reported in 2004 with seven dogs achieving a reduction in seizure frequency [26]. Unfortunately, the exact mechanism leading to the anti-epileptic and/or anti-seizure properties of KDs has not yet been fully elucidated, highlighting the need for more research, especially in veterinary medicine, to confirm the effects of diet in dogs with IE.  The ketogenic diet was first used in human epilepsy to mimic the metabolic state of fasting, as fasting was shown to have anti-seizure effects [27].",3df5daee-fcbb-4bbc-a253-0b1b5cca4479
3,background3," Under conditions of low carbohydrate intake, such as fasting, the liver metabolises triglycerides and releases fatty acids and subsequent ketone bodies into blood circulation, a process known as ketosis [28]. The ketone bodies replace glucose as the main source of energy in the brain [29]. A rise in brain ketones has been suggested to evoke anti-epileptic properties [30]. The ketone body Beta-hydroxybutric acid (body Beta hydroxybutric acid (BHB)) has been shown to reduce seizure-like neuronal activity and is thought to be mediated via KATP channel activity and inhibiting GABAB signalling in a Drosophila in-vitro model [31]. Similarly, intraperitoneal injection of body Beta hydroxybutric acid (BHB) led to increased body Beta hydroxybutric acid (BHB) serum concentrations and prolonged onset of seizures in a rat seizure model accompanied with neuroprotective effects observed in histopathology [32].",9acb560e-c2b9-4f14-af33-522ba5d0874f
4,background4," Other, newer in-vitro studies assumed body Beta hydroxybutric acid (BHB) as having neuroprotective function by direct gene regulation and promotion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) expression [33]. Apart from body Beta hydroxybutric acid (BHB), other in-vitro and in-vivo studies in rodent epilepsy models on other ketone bodies, such as acetone or acetoacetate, also indicated anticonvulsant action, ion channel interaction and potential synergistic role in ketogenic diets [34–38]. Many studies have reported the anti-seizure effects of different ketogenic diets and as such a myriad of hypotheses have been generated for the mechanisms of action [39–42]. Proposed mechanisms behind this dietary intervention include preventing neuronal hyperexcitability, direct inhibition of ion channels, influencing mitochondrial functions and altering amino acid metabolism to influence specific inhibitory neurotransmitter production [43–45].",bf10d761-5a5e-4044-a9b0-78656e636710
5,background5,"  At present, it is unclear whether the original KD would prove to be an effective anti-epileptic management option in dogs. To improve palatability and ketonemia, a variant of ‘classic‘KD was introduced in 1971 by Huttenlocher [46]. This subtype utilises medium chain triglycerides (medium chain fatty acid (MCT)) as fat resource found as being more ketogenic than long chain triglycerides (long chain triglycerides (LCT)) [47]. Up to date, many research groups found that medium chain fatty acid (MCT)-KD had also good anti- seizure properties [16, 41, 48]. As dogs have a higher capacity for ketone body utilisation, it is hard to induce and/or maintain clinically effective levels of ketosis and anticonvulsant efficacy in dogs comparable to human medicine [49]. In contrast, medium chain fatty acid (MCT)s are considered also as being more ketogenic in dogs due to subsequent transportation without pancreatic response and primarily metabolization into ketone bodies in the liver [39, 48–50].",c55b3272-54bd-4fd7-a129-bfcdc103e201
6,background6," medium chain fatty acid (MCT)-KD came therefrom more into research focus as the ketogenic diet for dogs [23, 24, 49, 51].  The main constituent of medium chain fatty acid (MCT)-KD are normally octanoic (C8, caprylic) and decanoic (C10, capric) triglycerides (TAGs) [52, 53]. A recent in-vitro study has revealed decanoic acid acts as a non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist that results in direct inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission, and thus exerts an anticonvulsant effect [54]. In comparison, octanoic acid alone revealed no anti-epileptic effects in in-vitro studies [55], but enhanced anticonvulsive properties in mice, when orally co- administered with C10 [56]. Ongoing research focusing on in vitro and rodent models also highlighted the importance of medium chain fatty acids with specific branching as anticonvulsant [57, 58].",11c421ae-19ff-4a29-803a-40050d76c98b
7,background7,"  In dogs, consumption of an medium chain fatty acid (MCT)-enriched diet (10% of total formula calories with C8, C10, C12) leads to significant elevation in body Beta hydroxybutric acid (BHB) concentration and improved seizure control [24, 45, 59–61]. medium chain fatty acid (MCT) intake also appears to be linked to a significant improvement in attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)) -related behaviour and fear/anxiety in dogs with epilepsy [23] and to have cognition-improving effects in aged dogs [61]. Recent research confirmed the observed benefits from medium chain fatty acid (MCT) enriched kibble diet in aged dogs with cognitive dysfunction syndrome (cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS)) in a prospective double blinded placebo controlled study design [62].",0084af79-f897-4f7b-9073-64baa01a7428
8,background8,"  In conclusion, albeit past research provides a solid base, the exact metabolic mechanisms governing anti- seizure effects from body Beta hydroxybutric acid (BHB) and/or medium chain fatty acid (MCT) remain elusive, not only in humans, but especially in dogs. Whether medium chain fatty acid (MCT)s can be an effective anti-seizure agent and show neuroprotective and anxiolytic effects in dogs with IE requires further investigation.  We hypothesise medium chain fatty acid (MCT)s administered as a daily supplement will reduce seizure frequency and severity, reduce the level of ASD side effects and positively influence behavioural comorbidities of epilepsy in dogs. The primary aims of this clinical study are to investigate the short- term influence of medium chain fatty acid (MCT)s given as a DS on seizure occurrence, disease progression, drug-response, behaviour and QoL of dogs with IE.",cfd0099a-a024-4a4d-b818-97848ebccc52
9,background9," Twelve weeks of feeding is considered the minimal duration to allow short-term evaluation of efficacy and safety for diets [24, 59]. Using the same test system as in our former study which for the first time demonstrated the efficacy of an medium chain fatty acid (MCT)- enriched kibble diet [24] will help us draw comparisons between studies and provide results in a reasonable time frame.  The rationale of the current study is not only to corroborate the former results [4, 63] using a supplement rather than using a complete manufactured diet, but also to investigate the broader effects of medium chain fatty acid (MCT)s on epilepsy and its comorbidities including their effects on cognition and behavioural comorbidities. This study should provide further information about the role of medium chain fatty acid (MCT) ingestion and its importance in canine epilepsy management [48, 49].",351836d8-7af3-4f05-9bac-10947d7811c7

35,background35," A perpendicular line at 0 mm represents ‘asymptomatic/normal’, while at 100 mm either the dog shows ‘ataxia so severe that it is unable to walk’ or ‘sedation to the extent that it only sleeps’ or ‘QoL is so poor euthanasia is requested’. On analysis, the length from 0 to the perpendicular line will be normalised to baseline for statistical comparison into a percentage value (0–100%, negative = improvement, positive = deterioration).    Monitoring metabolic responses At each study visit, blood is collected by venepuncture using standardised operation procedures for haematology, serum biochemistry, ASD serum concentrations (phenobarbital, potassium bromide), cPLI, body Beta hydroxybutric acid (BHB) and dynamic bile acid testing. The body Beta hydroxybutric acid (BHB) and postprandial bile acid sample is taken as one sample 2 h after feeding with oil supplement. The cortisol level in saliva will be assessed between study visits [79].",724df9f6-7ed0-42d8-9600-2cf7aa42b218
36,background36," The samples will be collected at the same time in the morning of each study visit. Furthermore, serum, urine and faecal samples are collected. These samples are used to investigate the metabolome and microbiome, respectively [80].  Data analysis After study completion, the data will be collated, and statistical analysis will be performed using SPPS V24 (IBM Deutschland GmbH, Ehningen, Germany) and Prism® (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA). Results will be considered significant if after correction for multiple testing the p value < 0.05.  For all baseline, efficacy and safety parameters, the following analysis will be performed (Additional file 4: Table S1):Individual values will be listed and if appropriate graphically presented per time point for each group.  For the continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will be calculated and tabulated per time point for each group.",a0cd7f78-d16d-4b28-a21d-d98b173796f0
37,background37," If data are normally distributed (as ascertained via plotting histograms of relevant variables and using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), the mean and standard error will be plotted over time for each group.  For the categorical or discrete parameters, a frequency table will be calculated and tabulated per time point of each group. A graphical presentation over time for each group will be made by means of a bar or pie chart.    Comparisons between the DS groups are made using match-paired Student’s t-tests for parametric data and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test for non-parametric data. The relationships between two variables are analysed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient for parametric and Spearman test for non-parametric data. Optionally, further multiple comparison correction based will be applied on individual data sets. The presence of cluster seizures is compared between DS periods using the McNemar test.",efe456c0-c968-4736-bfd7-b417ffd6af8c
38,background38,"  Statistical analysis is planned to be a combination of univariate (univariate (UVA)) and multivariate data analyses (multivariate data analyses (MVA)). A mixed effect model might be considered. Statistical testing will be adapted were appropriate (Additional file 4: Table S1).  Power calculation Our previous study did indicate that the effect of medium chain fatty acid (MCT)s on seizure frequency can be detected with n = 21 dogs [24]. Similarly, another study suggested twenty-two dogs in each group being sufficient for showing significant differences between two diet groups for seizure frequency [51]. In conclusion, we aimed to recruit at least 36 dogs to reach a minimum of 22 dogs to anticipate a usual patient dropout-rate of 30%. ",418f9fd9-d288-43a9-88a3-7c69a69951e2
39,methods0,"A 6-month prospective, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover, multicentre dietary trial is designed comparing a 9% metabolic energy based calculated medium-chain triglyceride (medium chain fatty acid (MCT)) oil supplement to a conventional ‘control’ DS.

Overall, the aim is to recruit thirty-six patients at five different centres and to investigate the effect of medium chain fatty acid (MCT)s as DS on seizure activity, tolerability, behavioural comorbidities and quality of life (QoL).

41,discussion0,"Using a crossover dietary trial approach, we will generate data to investigate the value of medium chain fatty acid (MCT) oil supplementation as a management tool for dogs diagnosed with IE not responding to standard ASD(s). If clinically and statistically significant effects are observed between the dietary periods, medium chain fatty acid (MCT) oil has the potential to become an easily adjustable add-on therapy for dogs with epilepsy.  This study will utilise a prospective, double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial with a crossover design. Considering these specific study features in the design, we do not only follow international high quality standards for clinical research, but also address potential biasing effects in clinical veterinary trials [81, 82].",551898ea-38e6-41e1-af23-01cf43a99529
42,discussion1," The integration of a dietary crossover with placebo/control period, double-blinding and block randomisation should minimise the regression-to-the-mean, the placebo and observer effects seen in other canine epilepsy trial in veterinary medicine [83]. We are confident that this design significantly increases the accuracy and representative nature of our expected findings on the use of medium chain fatty acid (MCT) oil as nutritional add-on management in dogs with IE.  Regression-to-the mean arises often in clinical trials when a variable is extreme on its first, but closer to the mean on its second measurement or vice versa [84–87]. In canine epilepsy trials, usually an extreme (hardest-to-treat) group is selected from an epileptic dog population based on the measurement of a particular variable.",1ce21abf-dad6-4f65-9ba4-81c7dd1aa1a2
43,discussion2," In this study, only dogs with idiopathic epilepsy TIER 2 level, classified as ‘drug-resistant’ with a poor seizure control are recruited, so that this phenomenon must be addressed in the study design. If this effect is not considered, the clinical trial or the interpretation of our obtained data can lead to incorrect conclusions, so must be then expected to be inaccurate or incorrect [88] .  The placebo effect is a well-known phenomenon in human medicine [89], however, limited information about the placebo effect exists in veterinary medicine to date [90]. Reports so far described caregiver placebo effect especially in association to chronic anti-inflammatory or analgesic treatment in small animals [91–93]. A decrease in seizure frequency of around 30% compared to baseline has been noted in different trials in canine epilepsy as potential placebo effects [83]. The occurrence of placebo effects are significantly associated with response expectancy [89].",c3660c40-bc55-4f14-9045-1cbe3f259cdb
44,discussion3," In canine epilepsy trials, the expectation from owners is usually higher due to physiological stress, often poor seizure control and the continuous negative impact on their own QoL [70, 79, 94, 95] so that a notably subjective influence on the dog can be more likely. A general run-in period given by the recruitment process, where owners are first enrolled on a waiting list and their dog are checked on study criteria before giving the first treatment, will also support to mitigate the response expectancy.  Another impact can derive from the Hawthorne effect or also known as the observer effect. When study individuals are aware of being observed within a clinically trial, their response to the trial situation can not only modify, often falsify study variables. The Hawthorne effect can therefore also be seen as an pre-placebo expectation [96].",41bbc773-346d-453c-a080-ee615822637c
45,discussion4," Alike in epilepsy research in human medicine [97], such type of reactivity should be considered as influencing factors from owners and their dogs in the design of canine epilepsy trials.  The integration of a dietary crossover in the mid of observation time, allows each participant to receive both dietary interventions. Each study object will therefore serve as its own control and reduce significant biasing effects [98]. Even though the retrospective baseline is documented, the data will be completely disregarded in most of the analysis and only applied were appropriate. This exclusion is to minimise the regression-to-the-mean and observed placebo effect in other canine epilepsy trial in veterinary medicine [83].  Keeping all involved individuals (tester, subject, owners) blind from the used dietary supplement is another attempt to eliminate bias and the expectancy from owners seeing responses in their dog’s seizure control after giving the specific DS.",1b71aa00-f165-446c-b009-b8c7aa4c54b2
46,discussion5," Not only observer, but also investigator bias might otherwise provoke incorrect observations, so that using a double-blinded design is most appropriate here. Describing the blinding methodology is important to give veterinarians the ability to assess the validity of the test results and apply in clinical environment [99] .  A core principal for clinical trials in human and veterinary medicine is the randomisation [100, 101]. The process of randomised allocation of each dog on its day of enrolment is considered in this study as being essential. The random assignment of each study subject to a predefined block (1st DS (AB), 2nd DS (BA)) reduces the impact of selection bias and increases the validity of the expected study results. Furthermore, the detailed reports about the allocation process makes it possible for practitioners to critically review the impact of bias on study results and make informed decisions regarding the treatment of their own epileptic patients [102].",0f25bc91-4715-48c7-ae26-d7348704a44e
47,discussion6,"  Overall, using not only a crossover design with a placebo/ control period, but also a block randomisation protocol and blinding should limit all above mentioned biasing effects to a possible maximum. Acting against hypothetical, multi-sided bias by implementing described trial features, should enable us to collect and assume not only controlled, but also representative data about medium chain fatty acid (MCT) consumption in dogs diagnosed with IE.  Dropout is often used as an outcome measure in clinical trials. But, in randomised clinical trial with epileptic patients, it appears to be higher than other clinical studies and partly explained by trial design features thus providing direction for future trial designs [103]. As a preventive measure, the total amount of patients recruited will be aimed to be increased by > 30% to ensure a sufficient number of patients that will finish the trial. Law et al. (2015) have shown an effect with 21 dogs finishing the trial.",c2503aa8-0237-4927-8559-859ed813fc4b
48,discussion7," Furthermore, in another study on ketogenic diet, twenty-two dogs in each group were suggested to be sufficient for showing significant differences between two diet groups for seizure frequency [51]. Accordingly, we aimed to recruit at least 36 dogs to reach a minimum of 22 dogs factoring a usual dropout-rate of 30%.  Although study features will be implemented to prevent massive biasing effects, limitations are in any clinical trial and must be reflected critically on data analysis. One limitation of this study design is that an intention to treat analysis (intention to treat analysis (ITTA)) can be challenging or impossible to perform. intention to treat analysis (ITTA) is an approach to the analysis in which our recruited patients are evaluated as block randomised, regardless of the dietary intervention they actually received [104].",cbbccfd9-c116-40dd-aba6-1e7f57ebfbe9
49,discussion8," This is especially hard to realise when most or all dogs that dropout are within the first study period, as was the case in our former medium chain fatty acid (MCT) study [24]. There is a chance that if randomisation is not carried out carefully, that results could be skewed as study dropouts will not be included in the paired statistical analysis. It is therefore of pivotal importance to document in detail (and if possible, compare statistically) the reasons why owners withdraw their dog from the study and during which study period. As aforementioned in the last study [24], the majority of the dropout dogs (7 out of 10) did not complete the first respective randomised allocated diet, hence there was no outcome measure at all for the remaining respective diet group. Using the last observation carried forward is not possible as there was no observation for the second diet.",0267f761-fbe3-4950-b439-3f6a7ea0df9f
50,discussion9,"  Furthermore, utilising a statistical imputation method of the outcome measure would require profound assumptions to be made on the missing outcome. Statistical imputation of outcome assuming the medium chain fatty acid (MCT) and placebo diet would be the same introduces bias towards the null. On the other hand, imputation assuming a difference on the probability of the outcome introduces bias towards the treatment effect. Considering that the primary aim of the study was to determine the anti-seizure efficacy of the ketogenic medium chain fatty acid (MCT) diet, the utilising of a per protocol analysis method is more suitable and logical [82].  Oil supplementation for dog owners as additional treatment for general health or targeted to epilepsy management is a common practice [105]. As the clinical trial aims to prove ketogenic medium chain fatty acid (MCT) oil supplementation as nutritional management for epileptic dogs, dietary characteristics and acceptance must be considered.",f6a2629d-a418-4236-99b7-a613f71dba76
51,discussion10," As a variable, palatability is the measure of intake of a food that indicates acceptance, or the measure of preference of one food over another [55]. Food with different characteristics can alter voluntary food intake by affecting palatability, taste or flavour [56]. Excluding bias linked to palatability in the main clinical trial, the food intake ratio should be similar. The mean food intake, as a percentage, can be calculated for each period and was used to assess the dogs eating preference. An intake ratio (IR) of over 0.50 would represent equivalent consumption. If intake ratio (IR) for a feeding period was greater than 0.50 at 0.55, this would lead one to conclude that it was consumed at a greater quantity [61]. Both oils will be proven in advance in a small palatability study to be well tolerated, similar consumed and no food preference was observed.",3c12d2b4-9857-4859-9fb6-c0b3220f50ee
52,discussion11," Eating time might be increased when the oil DS is given, and this may be due to ‘neophobia’ [57] - and this may take time for the dogs to habituate to the presence of a new flavour/texture in their diet [58]. In summary, a good and similar palatability without any acute gastrointestinal side effects should be concluded and monitored in the prospective dietary trial.  Canine nutrition needs to be considered for epilepsy management [60, 107–110]. Diet composition, content and some of the DSs mentioned could influence pharmacokinetic properties of ASDs and potentially modulate their efficacy [39, 61]. Owners of dogs with more severe epilepsy phenotypes, as recruited for this study, are likely to change unconsciously dietary regimes or DS due to higher levels of psychological stress [70, 79, 106], therefore owners were asked to keep diets and DS constant throughout the trial.",0d4bed79-d6de-4cc6-8ef1-0c2b220ab008
53,discussion12," In addition, owners were asked to daily monitor any changes in seizures, drugs used, and potential adverse events seen. Nevertheless, a balanced supply of all nutrients is routinely not checked in first opinion practice and might play a role for the interpretation of dietary effects occurring from medium chain fatty acid (MCT) oil supplementation. We will take great care of assessing the baseline diet as aforementioned. However, each dog will have a different baseline diet, which might influence the results and could be seen as another limitation of the study.
