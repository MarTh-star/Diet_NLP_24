0,introduction0,"Fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs) are polypeptides with diverse functions in development and metabolism. The human/mouse Fgf gene family comprises twenty-two members [1], [2]. Although Fgf21 was originally identified in mouse embryos, it is predominantly expressed in the liver in adults [3]. Later, Fgf21 was also identified as a stimulator of glucose uptake in cultured adipocytes [4]. Fgf21 along with Fgf15/19 and Fgf23 are members of the endocrine Fgf subfamily. Fgf21 potentially acts as a metabolic regulator in an endocrine manner [5], [6].  Hepatic Fgf21 expression, ketogenesis, and steatosis are greatly induced in mice fasted for 24 h [7], [8]. In Fgf21 transgenic mice, Fgf21 acts as an inducer for hepatic ketogenesis and steatosis and for adipocyte lipolysis [7]. In Fgf21 protein-administered mice, Fgf21 also acts directly on the liver to modulate hepatic metabolism [9]. These effects are pharmacological effects of Fgf21.",e702d5f0-3c54-4482-9b5e-1ebac95e1eb9
1,introduction1," In contrast, blood β-hydroxybutyrate and hepatic triglyceride levels in Fgf21 knockout mice fasted for 24 hours were comparable to those in fasted wild-type mice [8], [10], [11]. These results indicate that Fgf21 is not physiologically required for hepatic ketogenesis and steatosis induced by fasting [8]. However, blood non-esterified fatty acid (non esterified fatty acid (NEFA)) levels and adipocyte lipolysis were significantly increased in Fgf21 knockout mice fasted for 24 hours, indicating that Fgf21 acts as a negative regulator of adipocyte lipolysis in fasted mice [8]. These results indicate that the physiological roles of Fgf21 are different from its pharmacological effects.  A low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet (KD), which mimics the metabolic conditions of long-term starvation, induces a unique metabolic state [12], [13]. Hepatic Fgf21 expression and ketogenesis are greatly induced by KD feeding for at least 3 days [14].",c2229b3d-c472-4789-89e9-627b68483e53
2,introduction2," These results suggest that KD feeding for several days markedly affects energy metabolism in mice and Fgf21 is potentially involved in the changes of metabolic state induced by KD feeding. Recently, we have found that KD feeding for 5 days significantly induced torpor, the controlled lowering of body temperature and physical activity, which is an adaptation that various mammals use to cope with periods of low food availability [15], [16]. Torpor induced by KD feeding was significantly attenuated in Fgf21 knockout mice, indicating Fgf21 to be involved [16]. In addition, Badman reported that adenoviral knockdown of hepatic Fgf21 expression in mice fed KD for 4 days caused reduced blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels and hepatic steatosis [14]. These results suggest that further studies using Fgf21 knockout mice fed KD will contribute to an understanding of the metabolic roles of Fgf21.",ae05bc09-66ff-4d32-9a63-c138db039d0c
3,introduction3,"  In the present study, we examined the effects of KD feeding on metabolism and the roles of Fgf21 in metabolism in mice fed KD using a Fgf21 knockout line. The present findings indicate that insulin sensitivity was significantly impaired in mice fed KD for several days and Fgf21 induced to express by KD is a negative regulator of adipocyte insulin sensitivity in adaptation to a low-carbohydrate malnutritional state.

4,methods0,"2.1 Animal Experiments All mice were maintained in a light-controlled room (lights on from 0800 to 2000 h). 3-month-old C57BL/6 mice and Fgf21 knockout mice were allowed free access to normal chow (MF; 3.6 kcal/g, 12% kcal fat, source: soybean; Oriental Yeast, Japan) or KD (TD.96355; 6.7 kcal/g, 15.3% protein, 0.6% carbohydrate, and 67.4% fat (wt/wt); Harlan, USA) for indicated periods. The experiments were performed using male mice. All mice were sacrificed to obtain tissues and blood samples at 1200 h. Fgf21 knockout mice were generated as described [8] and maintained on a C57BL/6 background. All animal studies were conducted in accordance with International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals, and approved by the Animal Research Committee of Kyoto University Pharmaceutical Sciences.  2.2 Blood Parameter Analysis Blood samples were obtained from the mice.

At first, blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels in mice fed KD were examined (Figure 1A). Blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels were almost unchanged by NC feeding until 14 days. In contrast, blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels were greatly increased in m ice fed KD for 6 days, compared with mice fed normal chow (NC). The blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels in mice fed KD for 14 days were comparable to those for 6 days, indicating that hepatic ketogenesis was already induced effectively by KD feeding for 6 days. We also examined body weights and blood parameters of mice fed NC or KD. The body weights were gradually increased in mice fed NC until 14 days (Figure 1B). Until 14 days, the body weights in mice fed KD were essentially comparable to those in mice fed NC.",8f4cf704-355c-4e33-903e-046cd76eb6b2

The blood glucose levels were essentially unchanged by NC feeding until 14 days (Figure 1E). In contrast, the blood glucose levels were significantly decreased by KD feeding. The blood glucose levels in mice fed KD for 6 days were significantly lower than those in mice fed NC for 6 days (P<0.05). This decrease in blood glucose levels in mice fed KD suggests that blood insulin levels are decreased in the mice fed KD. But blood insulin levels in mice was not decreased but tended to be increased in mice fed KD for 6 days, compared with those of mice fed NC for 6 days (P = 0.12).

Therefore, we examined glucose metabolism in mice fed NC or KD for 6 or 14 days using the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (glucose tolerance test (GTT)). In mice fed KD for 6 days, glucose levels remained high compared with those in mice fed NC at 60 or 90 minutes after the glucose loading (Figure 2A).",c2b377a9-fb31-455a-9da6-b93ab1b9b2e0

These results suggested that insulin sensitivity might be impaired by KD feeding for 6 days. Therefore, we next examined insulin sensitivity in mice fed KD for 6 days using insulin tolerance test (insulin tolerance test (ITT)). During the insulin tolerance test (ITT), glucose levels were significantly higher in mice fed KD than those fed NC at 15 and 30 minutes after the insulin loading (Figure 2B).

25,discussion1," In addition, insulin signaling in white adipose tissue was impaired in the mice fed KD, but that in liver and muscle was not. These results suggest that whole-body glucose tolerance in mice fed KD is impaired by the impairment of insulin signaling in white adipose tissue. However, James et al. reported that white adipose tissue accounts for less than 10% of whole-body glucose uptake in rat fed normal chow [22]. Therefore it cannot be assumed that the impairment of glucose uptake in white adipose tissue is solely responsible for whole-body glucose intorelance in mice fed KD. It is possible that whole-body glucose intolerance induced by KD feeding might be caused by the change of glucose metabolism in other tissues including liver and muscle, in addition to the impairment of insulin signaling in white adipose tissue. Alternatively, white adipose tissue might contribute to whole-body glucose uptake much more under a low-carbohydrate malnutritional state than a normal state.",6603d6df-0adf-495d-98d8-0c1b98f7236a
26,discussion2," Further studies are required to reveal the detailed mechanism underlying the altered glucose metabolism in mice fed KD.  4.2 Essentially No Role of Fgf21 in Hepatic Ketogenesis, Triglyceride Metabolism, and Gluconeogenesis in Mice Fed KD Experiments using Fgf21 transgenic or Fgf21 protein-administered mice indicate that Fgf21 exerts pharmacological effects on hepatic ketogenesis [7], [9]. However, our previous experiments using Fgf21 knockout mice fasted for 24 hours demonstrated that Fgf21 is not physiologically required for hepatic ketogenesis [8]. The present experiments using Fgf21 knockout mice fed KD for 6 or 14 days also show that Fgf21 is not physiologically required for hepatic ketogenesis. These results indicate that the physiological roles of Fgf21 in hepatic ketogenesis are different from its pharmacological effects. Adenoviral knockdown of hepatic Fgf21 expression in mice fed KD for 4 days resulted in fatty liver and reduced blood β-hybroxybutyrate levels [10].",c0a2ac52-8fc6-445f-a6e7-cb95f6320adb

29,discussion5," These results indicate that Fgf21 induces glucose intolerance by impairing adipocyte insulin sensitivity in mice fed KD.  Inflammation in the white adipose tissue is reported to cause insulin resistance [23]. We examined the expression of inflammation-related genes including Tumor necrosis factor-α (Tnf-α), Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Mcp-1), and Serine protease inhibitor 2 (Serpin 2) in the white adipose tissue of wild-type or Fgf21 knockout mice fed NC or KD. However, KD feeding did not significantly affect their expression levels (data not shown). These results indicate that insulin resistance induced by Fgf21 is not mediated by inflammation in the white adipose tissue. Therefore, the molecular mechanism underlying the impairment of insulin sensitivity in white adipose tissue remains unknown.   Fgf21 is also expressed in the white adipose tissue as well as in liver.",cd50346d-a2a8-43e7-aad4-dcccab005054
30,discussion6," It was reported that Fgf21 induced to express by cold exposure or rosiglitazone regulated Pparγ activity in the white adipose tissue in an autocrine/paracrine manner, respectively, although it did not affect blood Fgf21 levels [24], [25]. For example, Fgf21 expression in the white adipose tissue was at least about 5 times higher in cold conditions than in normal conditions [25]. Therefore, we examined Fgf21 expression in the white adipose tissue of mice fed KD. Fgf21 expression levels in the white adipose tissue in mice fed KD were significantly but slightly higher than those in mice fed NC and were much lower than hepatic Fgf21 expression levels (data not shown). These results suggest that hepatic Fgf21, which acts in an endocrine manner, is a negative regulator of adipocyte insulin sensitivity in the adaptation to a low-carbohydrate malnutritional state induced by KD feeding.  4.4 Difference between Two Fgf21 Knockout Mouse Lines Fed KD Badman et al.",8fbd0c63-ec7d-4967-80c1-a0a82976cd20
31,discussion7," reported the phenotypes of Fgf21 knockout mice fed KD for 2 weeks [10]. Their mice had mild weight gain, developed hepatosteatosis, and showed partial impairments of ketogenesis. Furthermore, their mice fed KD for 2 weeks had mild glucose intolerance in the absence of a significant change in insulin sensitivity. The phenotypes of our Fgf21 knockout mice fed KD for 6 days differed from those of their mice fed KD for 2 weeks. We also examined our knockout mice fed KD for 2 weeks. Our Fgf21 knockout mice fed KD for 2 weeks did not show mild weight gain, did not show partial impairments of ketogenesis, did not develop hepatosteatosis, and did not develop mild hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia (data not shown). Our mice were fed a diet (Harlan TD.96355) consisting of 15.3% protein, 0.6% carbohydrate, and 67.4% fat (wt/wt). The Fgf21 knockout mice of Badman et al. were fed a diet (Bio-Serv F3666) consisting of 9.5% protein, 0.76% carbohydrate, and 78.9% fat (wt/wt).",061adacb-f4e6-4d47-8f5e-16523a417802
32,discussion8," However, both KDs induced ketogenesis. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels in our mice were comparable to those in their mice (0.74±0.07 mmol/L vs. 0.81±0.13 mmol/L, respectively) [10]. In addition, both KDs markedly induced hepatic Fgf21 expression; therefore, we believe that the difference between the diets did not cause the differences between the two knockout lines. The reason for the difference between the two lines of mice remains unknown.
