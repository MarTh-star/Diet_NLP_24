0,introduction0,"Primary defects in lipid metabolism are associated with myelin disease [13] and vice versa, a growing number of neurodegenerative diseases [1, 2, 14, 68], including the hereditary leukodystrophy Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD)), is associated with a perturbed brain lipid metabolism [29, 57, 63, 73]. In the nervous system, the majority of lipids is found in myelin sheaths, a multilayered stack of membranes synthesized by oligodendrocytes. Myelinating oligodendrocytes contribute to axon integrity by providing trophic support and electrical insulation for impulse propagation [23, 33]. Myelination failure is hence associated with axon damage and dysfunction leading to deficits in cognition and motor abilities.  Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) is most frequently caused by a duplication of the X-linked myelin gene PLP1 (proteolipid protein 1) [11, 24, 40, 59, 74].",13b570ae-2610-4b23-ac7b-f959b41e92ff
1,introduction1," Pathological hypomyelination and symptoms such as nystagmus, hypotonia, spasticity, ataxia and retarded cognitive development are characteristic of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD). At present, Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) lacks any therapeutic option and the symptomatic and supportive medications are directed at seizure or spasticity control. In Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) oligodendrocytes, overexpressed PLP accumulates together with cholesterol which impairs the intracellular transport of proteins and lipids to the growing myelin sheath [31, 57, 62]. In combination with the progressive loss of mutant oligodendrocytes, this leads to dysmyelination and demyelination in Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) [11, 53, 59]. The Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pattern of diffuse hypomyelination in Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) caused by PLP1 duplication is hence considered consequence of arrested brain maturation and lacks focal or inflammatory demyelination [9, 66, 71].",af04c63f-0f65-4135-85cc-c2ae4c6fdc3b
2,introduction2," Despite variable disease severity of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) duplication patients, hypomyelination improves only to a minor extent over time. At later stages, axon degeneration is also a feature of the Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) pathology, leading to cortical atrophy that likely contributes to neurological impairment [9, 35]. It has been shown in vitro and in vivo that lipid supplementation can enhance myelination in hypomyelinating pathologies and thereby promote repair [6, 21, 55–57]. However, under physiological conditions plasma cholesterol cannot cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) [7]. In a previous study, we found that the BBB is perturbed in a line of Plp1 transgenic mice (Plp1tg-72 [51]), a model of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD), allowing the entry of cholesterol from the circulation into the CNS. In this model, dietary supplementation with cholesterol strongly improves myelination [57].",dedcc4f3-c7ec-4918-9a28-8eb1067a155f
3,introduction3,"  Here, we hypothesized that (1) the accessibility to the CNS determines the efficacy of lipid treatment, and (2) in the CNS, the different lipid classes target distinct aspects of the hypomyelinating pathology, i.e. the primary defect in myelin-forming oligodendrocytes and the subsequent damage of hypo/demyelinated axons. This study combines two important therapeutic targets, cholesterol for the support of remyelinating oligodendrocytes and ketone bodies for the metabolic support of the axonal compartment.  Results and discussion Dietary cholesterol does not rescue hypomyelination in Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) patients Active demyelination with inflammatory responses in patients with Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) [24] predicts at least minor BBB disturbances. Therefore, in an individual, compassionate use trial, we first asked whether we could translate the dietary treatment approach in two patients with Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) caused by PLP1 duplication.",0725f1de-f694-44d0-aa83-423201c2e7d3
4,introduction4," Daily cholesterol supplementation of up to 590 mg/kg was well tolerated and blood lipid and glucose values remained in the normal range (Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 1). No adverse reactions were observed in the Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) patients, in agreement with cholesterol supplementation studies in patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz disease [18]. However, a therapeutic benefit was not as obvious as in Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) mice. By Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements, hypomyelination remained stable over 2 years of treatment (Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 2) which is consistent with the normal course of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) disease [59, 66]. Taken together, dietary supplementation with high dose cholesterol was safe in our two Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) patients and long term disease monitoring will decide about the potential therapeutic benefit of this treatment strategy.",f4584fe9-c6f7-4574-a257-25cc1ed93822
5,introduction5,"  In Plp1tg-72 mice, the compromised BBB allowed access of cholesterol from the circulation into the brain [57]. In contrast, in Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) the comparative analysis of CSF and serum did not reveal gross disturbance of BBB integrity (Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 1a), in agreement with the lack of enhancing gadolinium signals in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) patient [43]. In a substrain of Plp1tg-72 mice with preserved BBB integrity (Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 3a-b), the dietary cholesterol supplementation only moderately ameliorated myelin disease (Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 3c-d), most likely reflecting the limited therapeutic success in Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) patients. Of note, Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) patients and both Plp1tg mouse strains show a comparable initial increase in serum cholesterol (Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 1b, Online Resource Supplemental Fig.",223b4722-d5d3-435c-acdb-5526efce76fa
6,introduction6," 3e) [57] as expected from healthy adult individuals [30], suggesting that serum cholesterol alone does not suffice to predict treatment efficacy. Since the substrain of Plp1tg-72 mice more adequately models human Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD), we used this line, termed Plp1tgB below, in subsequent experiments.  Ketogenic diet improves pathology in a Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) model with preserved BBB integrity The consumption of a high-fat/low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet causes the liver to generate ketone bodies. In the brain, ketone bodies such as beta-hydroxybutyrate facilitate sterol synthesis [32] which is essential for myelin membrane growth [55]. Thus, we asked whether a ketogenic diet that promotes CNS lipid metabolism under conditions of preserved BBB function [22, 32, 50] is also effective in hypomyelinating disease.",c8354690-8dcc-4b89-84d1-d4ebfaa1f3a2
7,introduction7," Plp1tgB and control mice were given a ketogenic diet (KD) or standard a chow diet (SD) between 2 and 12 weeks of age and physiological parameters were monitored weekly (Fig. 1a). Already after 7 days of dietary intervention with KD, blood levels of ketone bodies strongly increased (about fivefold) and serum glucose dropped to about 70% of the level in SD fed mice (Fig. 1b, Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 4a, b). Ketone bodies are imported into the brain by monocarboxylate transporters, mainly MCT1 expressed by endothelial cells [37]. In accordance with ongoing ketosis, mRNA and protein levels of monocarboxylate transporters as well as enzymes of ketone body utilization significantly increased. This included the rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway, 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1 (OXCT1, also termed Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase 1, SCOT, EC:2.8.3.5) whose abundance was threefold elevated in spinal cord of KD fed Plp1tgB mice, even more obvious by immunolabeling (Fig.",bcc50a3c-ba08-431c-a3a5-eac238b23f88

As expected, the number of Olig2- and c mature oligodendrocytes (CAII)-positive oligodendroglia was reduced in SD fed Plp1tgB mice, but feeding the KD diet rescued this defect in mutants (Fig. 2a). Moreover, untreated Plp1tgB mutant mice showed a robust endoplasmic reticulum stress response with about fourfold elevated ATF6 mRNA and protein levels.",d7db8e29-b0d6-41cf-93ac-b28db4fea127
10,introduction10," Both were significantly ameliorated in KD fed mutant mice (Fig. 2b, Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 4e). In agreement with the reduced oligodendroglial pathology, also astrogliosis and microgliosis were ameliorated in KD fed Plp1tgB compared to SD fed mutants (Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 5). Plp1 mRNA overexpression is the primary defect in the classical form of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) and in our mouse model [11, 51]. Feeding Plp1tgB mutants with KD did not lower Plp1 expression but rather increased Plp1 mRNA levels slightly (Fig. 2c), presumably reflecting enhanced oligodendrocyte survival. Indeed, the severe hypomyelination of untreated Plp1tgB mice was ameliorated by feeding a KD, as evidenced by fewer unmyelinated axons (g-ratio = 1) and more normally myelinated axons (g-ratio < 0.8), resulting in an overall reduction in mean g-ratio, as determined for the corticospinal tract (Fig. 2d, e).",3cb6e029-2287-4c93-9de6-c667223db047
11,introduction11," We next investigated whether feeding KD also ameliorated the clinical phenotype of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) mice. When we assessed motor performance by two different behavioral tests, elevated beam test and rotarod test, untreated Plp1tgB mice showed progressive worsening of motor functions. By contrast, KD fed Plp1tgB animals retained their motor fitness at wild type levels (Fig. 2f, g). For comparison, feeding Plp1tgB mice a medium-chain triglyceride diet, which contains less fat than classical KD, elicited only a mild ketosis in our mice. This dietary regimen did not ameliorate motor performance, suggesting a critical role of ketone bodies rather than a direct effect of triglycerides/lipids (Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 6).Fig. 2 KD ameliorates Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) pathology in Plp1tgB animals.",81133eae-cdae-4a5b-9c7b-87aecf5b2c4c

Scale bars 20 µm    Ketogenic diet ameliorates mitochondrial abnormalities in axons of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) mice It is unlikely that the moderately improved myelination explains the dramatic improvement in motor functions in KD fed Plp1tgB animals. In Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) patients, motor development is strongly retarded, and progressive axonal loss likely causes the gradual decline of motor functions already achieved [58].",fb74fd4d-1275-46b3-8a5a-3f67e2eca1e9
14,introduction14," In accordance, the frequent axonal swellings (spheroids) in Plp1tgB mice were strongly reduced when feeding a KD (Fig. 3a). In addition, we observed in Plp1tgB mice that many axons contained enlarged mitochondrial profiles (Fig. 3b), as observed before in other models of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) [28, 45, 53].

This enlargement was most evident in unmyelinated axons (Fig. 3c, d), and even detectable in young mutants (Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 7). Importantly, KD completely normalized this phenomenon, which was most evident in axons that remained unmyelinated, and correlated well with the reduced volume of mitochondria, modelled from deconvolved confocal image stacks (Fig.",05652637-ad94-4f6c-ba69-0177d68123c4
18,introduction18," 3c–e, Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 8). We also determined mRNA and protein abundance of several mitochondrial markers in spinal cord lysates to correlate mitochondrial morphology to alterations in fusion or fission of mitochondria but neither of the tested markers showed significant differences between the two treatment groups of Plp1tgB animals, likely because this analysis reflect the sum of neuronal and glial mitochondria (Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 9). Notably, feeding a cholesterol supplemented chow to Plp1tg animals (Plp1tgB or Plp1tg-72) did not reverse the increased mitochondrial sizes, even where myelination was improved (Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 3f). This suggests that high-cholesterol and ketogenic diets supported distinct therapeutic pathways.  The latter prompted us to evaluate the impact of KD on axonal integrity in the absence of myelin and analyzed optic nerves of Plp1tgB animals.",f53a88d6-a1a0-44c7-9433-13175500ea8f
19,introduction19," When untreated, this fiber tract is almost devoid of myelin at the age of 12 weeks but unmyelinated axons appear morphologically healthy and retinal ganglion cells are not degenerated [20, 57]. Here, the KD diet showed only a modest effect on hypomyelination (Fig. 3f), but ameliorated the enlarged axonal mitochondria, similar to our observations in the corticospinal tract (Fig. 3g).  Next, we assessed the functional significance of mitochondrial abnormalities in hypomyelinated axons by sensitive electrophysiological analyses. Specifically, in acute ex-vivo preparations of the optic nerve, we quantified nerve conduction and functional axon integrity, by comparing compound axon potentials (compound axon potentials (CAP)) as described [54, 69].",b93684e7-adb6-41da-918b-fbecfe89961b
20,introduction20," As expected for hypomyelinated fibers [4, 54, 64], optic nerves of untreated Plp1tgB mice exhibited an abnormally attenuated evoked response with a strong after-hyperpolarization phase caused by elevated activity of potassium channels (Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 10). In KD fed Plp1tgB mutants, in contrast, compound axon potentials (CAP) amplitude and compound axon potentials (CAP) area was significantly increased compared to their SD fed littermates, implying that more axons contributed to evoked impulse propagation (Fig. 3h–j). Nerve conduction velocity of Plp1tgB mice was slightly increased in KD fed animals, likely reflecting the increased density of myelinated axons (Fig. 3f, k).  Glycolytic oligodendrocytes support the axonal energy metabolism by exporting lactate [23, 36]. To bypass this glial support and rather directly assess mitochondrial function in axons, we challenged the axonal energy metabolism during repeated firing.",ec7d9cea-f0d4-4666-b96f-7d7d2ce97813
21,introduction21," Specifically, we monitored compound axon potentials (CAP)s in the optic nerve in the absence of glucose and in the presence of a suboptimal lactate concentration (3 mM) during 5 Hz stimulation for 75 min [10], followed by a recovery period in the presence of both lactate and glucose. In wild type optic nerves, this protocol led to a gradual reduction of compound axon potentials (CAP)s to about 25% of baseline values (Fig. 3l), in agreement with recent findings in the corpus callosum [41]. In optic nerves from Plp1tgB mice, however, the resulting compound axon potentials (CAP) decay was even stronger and more rapid than in wild type controls, demonstrating that the Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) pathology affects the ability of axons to utilize lactate to maintain conduction.",ca2a8959-dea6-4eaa-8c23-8c78d5efce92
22,introduction22," Feeding a KD to Plp1tgB mice attenuated the compound axon potentials (CAP) decay (of 5 Hz stimulated optic nerves ex vivo), suggesting that optic nerves from KD fed mice are more resilient to this metabolic stress (Fig. 3l, m). Moreover, in this protocol we noted a strong (80%) recovery of the original compound axon potentials (CAP) amplitude in nerves from KD fed mice comparable to wild types, contrasting to only 40% recovery in SD fed mice (Fig. 3l–n). This finding demonstrates that Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD), which primarily perturbs myelination, also indirectly affects axonal energy metabolism. These data also suggest that axonal integrity can be uncoupled from the myelination status by the KD. That is, despite the marginally increased myelination of the optic nerve of Plp1tgB mice when fed the KD, dysmyelinated axons functionally improved, as evidenced by physiological recordings, and this effect was accompanied by morphological normalization of axonal mitochondria.",69581627-03e2-400b-b9d3-6ccc5d6549e2

26,introduction26," 11e, f), likely reflecting ongoing ketone body utilization. Cuprizone leads to the death of most mature oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum [39, 49], and after the withdrawal of cuprizone, myelin repair is reflected in an increasing number of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and gradual remyelination. While the number of Olig2 positive cells was not altered in KD fed mice compared to SD fed controls, the rate of oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation to c mature oligodendrocytes (CAII) positive oligodendrocytes was strongly increased in KD fed mice (Fig. 4b–d, Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 11-12). In accordance, by feeding KD remyelination was accelerated about twofold at only 7 days after acute demyelination, and at 2 weeks after chronic demyelination (Fig. 4e–g).  In contrast, the degree of astrogliosis and microgliosis and expression of enzymes involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen species appeared unaffected by KD (Online Resource Supplemental Fig.",bd72b7ad-68d8-4018-bf61-ac8ac134b9d8

However, in contrast to a dietary intervention study with KD in MS patients [8], their expression was not altered by KD in our study. Axonal defects, as assessed by the density of APP positive axonal spheroids, was reduced by about 50% in KD fed mice compared to SD fed controls (Fig. 4h, Online Resource Supplemental Fig. 12). In addition, the cross-sectional size of axonal mitochondria, which were increased in SD fed mice during remyelination, even normalized (Fig. 4g, i). This suggests that the loss of oligodendroglial integrity rather than gliosis correlates with axonal perturbations.",e30bd501-6f4a-436a-b372-6b237253d276
28,introduction28," Finally, motor abilities, as quantified by an elevated beam test, also improved in KD fed mice (Fig. 4j). Thus, similar to our findings in developmental dysmyelination, KD also promoted functional repair in acute and chronic adult remyelination paradigms.  In this study, we have used two models of white matter disease with distinct etiologies and pathomechanisms, and found that feeding a KD is remarkably efficient in preserving axonal and oligodendroglial integrity. Plp1tgB mutants model the hereditary leukodystrophy Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD), in which overexpression of the myelin protein PLP induces cellular stress in differentiating oligodendroglia followed by dysmyelination and demyelination [67]. In contrast, the pharmacological cuprizone model induces transient demyelination and also assesses remyelination in adult mice [39, 49].",1851c747-0e98-4d49-9806-6cb6c161db86
29,introduction29," In both disease models, axon damage is likely secondary to the primary oligodendroglial defect [15, 34, 59], but a detailed understanding of the axonal injury is lacking. A combinatory effect of reduced metabolic support by injured oligodendrocytes and the exposure to pro-inflammatory factors, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, is most likely [15, 34]. In the Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) mouse model, we found mitochondrial enlargement not only in dysmyelinated axons but also in myelinated axons before overt demyelination, suggesting metabolic problems in axons at an early preclinical stage.  The KD dramatically changes the global metabolism and induces a plethora of alterations in the body including the CNS [50]. While discussed in many neurodegenerative diseases, KD is currently used in the management of epilepsy [3, 16, 70].",18dd9568-43fd-4aad-b8fc-c89a2c742711
30,introduction30," The mechanisms of seizure control are likely diverse, involve the gut microbiota [46] and may act in parallel, including effects on neurotransmission, epigenetic gene regulation, energy metabolism, and anti-inflammatory activity [16, 22, 61]. Our preclinical data reveal that KD provides metabolic support to axons in two distinct myelin pathologies that model key aspects of human myelin disease and mechanisms of recovery. We specifically note that also (chronically) unmyelinated axons appear to profit from KD.  Ketone bodies share some of the molecular targets with certain fatty acids that are contained in or processed from high-fat ketogenic diet regimens [3, 61]. However, in our study, a medium-chain triglyceride diet that only slightly raised blood ketone body levels was therapeutically ineffective, suggesting a critical and direct role of ketone bodies in the therapy of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD).",4e6cb19a-c60c-4b62-a16b-309bce5b57de
31,introduction31,"  We envision the following scenario of causal relations: (1) In Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD), PLP overexpression induces endoplasmic reticulum stress which affects oligodendrocytes and likely disturbs the oligodendroglial trophic support to axons. Chronic damage ultimately leads to loss of Plp1-overexpressing oligodendrocytes and demyelination. In the cuprizone model, pharmacologically induced oligodendrogliopathy causes demyelination. (2) To maintain impulse conduction unmyelinated axons require about five-fold more energy compared to the same tissue volume of myelinated axons [44]. Hence, aberrantly unmyelinated axons suffer from energy deficits because of the insufficient support by mutant oligodendrocytes and increased energy demands. (3) Energy deprived cells typically increase the activity of mitochondria. In addition, demyelination triggers inflammatory responses involving production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.",73b4dd48-6a9a-474c-b469-f3bcbae2d583
32,introduction32," Increased mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress are both associated with morphological changes and volume enlargement of mitochondria [38, 48] as observed in axons of both models of myelin disease. Chronic oxidative stress might damage mtDNA and mitochondrial enzymes [53] that could further trigger compensatory volume increases of mitochondria and aggravate degenerative processes. (4) In contrast to glucose, ketone bodies are directly metabolized by mitochondria fueling into the tricarboxylic cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Since feeding a KD supports the conduction of optic nerve axons even in the absence of substantial myelination, we propose there is a direct supportive effect of KD on mitochondrial integrity in dysmyelinated axons. Bypassing the need for oligodendroglial trophic support could restore axonal mitochondria function (and morphology) and resolve energy deficits of axons.",ed3aaf44-d006-410a-b1d8-92d464825f8e
33,introduction33," Relieving oligodendrocytes from the task to provide energetic support to axons might also contribute to the increased survival of mutant oligodendrocytes and to the ameliorated Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) pathology.  In contrast to the developmental Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) model, adult remyelination in the cuprizone model strongly benefitted from the KD, in line with previous findings using a fasting mimicking diet [12]. Here, we suggest that a compromised BBB in cuprizone fed animals allows for the entry of circulating cholesterol into the CNS (further enhanced by the KD that contains 0.1% cholesterol) [5, 6]. While the BBB may remain largely intact in classical human Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD), it is perturbed in other myelin diseases with a stronger inflammatory component.",19d84f7c-82df-4f9b-802d-798cfeeaecbd
34,introduction34," We conclude that there is a clear rationale to consider KD or a derivative as a future therapy for myelin diseases as it combines two important therapeutic targets, cholesterol for the support of remyelinating oligodendrocytes and ketone bodies for the metabolic support of the axonal compartment, and future clinical trials will reveal its feasibility in the management of demyelinating episodes.
