0,methods0,"  KEETO-CROSS Study Design  We conducted a crossover, open-label, noninferiority trial comparing exogenous ketosis (KE) with endogenous ketosis (KD) (NCT04275453). Participants were randomly assigned to the KE arm (1 visit) or KD arm (including 2 visits occurring at 24 and 72 h) with at least a 1-wk washout period in between arms. Participants aged 18–60 y were enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania between January 2020 and January 2021. To ensure that any myocardial glucose uptake would be physiologic rather than indicative of underlying pathology, we excluded individuals with any reported history of cardiovascular disease (including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus). We also excluded pregnant and breast-feeding women. Recruitment was continued until a total of 18 participants attended all 3 visits (KE, 24-h KD, and 72-h KD) to adequately power the trial.",c27a92ce-4911-4512-810e-9b9cf95a72b7

The study was approved by an institutional review board and informed consent was obtained.  Patient Preparation Methods  KE Arm  Participants in the KE arm were permitted to eat a regular diet during the day before their study visit and started fasting at least by midnight before 18F-FDG PET (Fig. 1). During the visit, participants received weight-based dosing (714 mg/kg) of (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (H.V.M.N.), which has been extensively studied for the purposes of achieving ketosis (8–10). Briefly, this KE undergoes rapid enzymatic hydrolysis ultimately to form BHB (and other ketone bodies), achieving high BHB levels in less than 1 h with a short compound half-life (0.8–3.1 h). This high dose was selected to engender robust ketosis and substrate competition.",7f1de61a-2994-4496-93e9-e63abf396cd1

The day before the 24-h KD visit, participants began a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet intended to achieve less than 20 g of carbohydrate intake per day (supplemental materials) and fasted from at least midnight until 18F-FDG PET scanning the next day. Thereafter, they continued the KD for 2 additional days, fasting again from at least midnight before the 72-h KD visit.",e893a312-6caf-41ff-b95f-376c8040d04b

All participants were deemed to have adequate dietary adherence by dietary log review.  Laboratory Testing and Echocardiography  Details of laboratory testing (for BHB, insulin, glucagon, nonesterified fatty acid [NEFA], and glucose levels) and echocardiography are available in the supplemental materials.  18F-FDG PET Protocol and Study Outcomes  Participants underwent 18F-FDG PET using a PET/CT scanner (Ingenuity TF; Philips). At study visits, 18F-FDG (∼185 MBq [∼5.0 mCi]) was injected, and PET images of the chest were acquired 1 h later. Low-dose CT images were also acquired for attenuation-correction purposes and to aid in distinguishing 18F-FDG activity in the myocardium and blood pool on fused PET/CT images. Images were analyzed using MIM software by a board-certified nuclear cardiologist masked to participant characteristics.",b693b194-7aa8-4467-b400-7a746ed3b133

Statistical Analysis  Baseline characteristics were described using mean ± SD and medians and 25th–75th percentiles or percentages as appropriate for the levels of measurement and distributions of the variables. Biomarker levels were compared using nonparametric testing because they were right-skewed, and the false-discovery rate method was used for multiple testing correction.

Posttranslational protein acetylation and attenuation of insulin signaling are both required mechanisms for successful inhibition of glucose transporter member 4 (GLUT4) translocation. Acute administration of KE drink leads to a severalfold increment in β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) levels but also appears to decrease free fatty acid (free fatty acid (FFA)) levels, which may ultimately affect modulation of insulin signaling and process of acetylation. In contrast, although KD yields lower βHB levels after 24–72 h, it increases free fatty acid (FFA) and glucagon and lowers insulin levels on a sustained fashion, eventually augmenting fatty acid oxidation (fatty acid oxidation (FAO)) over glucose oxidation (“Randle effect”), increasing protein acetylation, and limiting insulin signaling.",de35631a-5f6f-45f5-9858-77acae475382

20,discussion0,"  18F-FDG PET plays a critical role in assessing cardiovascular inflammation, infection, and tumors, yet adequate myocardial preparation to suppress physiologic glucose uptake remains a substantial diagnostic barrier, particularly as certain patterns of incomplete suppression (Fig. 5) can be indistinguishable from pathology. Such challenges may ultimately lead to misdiagnosis, inappropriate therapy, along with potentially harmful side effects, extra radiation exposure for repeated testing, and unnecessary costs to the patient and health-care system.  In KEETO-CROSS, an open-label, crossover trial of healthy participants, we found that a generalized strategy of KE was inferior to 24- and 72-h KD to achieve myocardial glucose suppression (MGS). However, a few individuals who failed the KD were able to suppress with the KE drink.",90ef735c-6f98-4c0b-87a6-f30fd8b1edca
21,discussion1," Importantly, however, we found that serum BHB levels during the KD robustly predicted myocardial glucose suppression (MGS) and identified potential thresholds that can be used upstream of 18F-FDG PET to predict myocardial glucose suppression (MGS), thereby reducing false-positive or indeterminate scans. To facilitate clinical implementation, we tested the utility of a Point of Care (POC) ketone meter that showed an ability to predict myocardial glucose suppression (MGS) similar to laboratory-based analysis. Thus, our findings support the continued use of the dietary modification through the KD rather than KE to achieve myocardial glucose suppression (MGS), provide strong evidence for assessing BHB levels before 18F-FDG PET to ensure adequate dietary preparation, and demonstrate how a Point of Care (POC) ketone device can be implemented to aid in rapid-decision making.",9546f3c3-86f8-44b6-854a-b3909dcc9e5d
22,discussion2,"  Despite several strategies to facilitate the myocardial “metabolic switch” to suppress physiologic glucose uptake, current myocardial glucose suppression (MGS) rates vary substantially, though much of these data are derived retrospectively and from convenience cohorts referred for clinical indications (2). The current trial was designed to address these challenges by investigating the use of an oral KE, which could facilitate same-day scans without patient preparation, in healthy volunteers. Endogenous and exogenous ketosis suppress myocardial glucose uptake in different ways (Fig. 7). Although endogenous ketosis has been standard-of-care for myocardial glucose suppression (MGS), exogenous ketones also reduce myocardial glucose uptake, as shown in preclinical and clinical work (11,12). However, our results demonstrate that despite significant acute ketosis achieved, rates of suppression were inferior to the KD.",4b6bb20c-1ddc-4ce6-9588-70bd61f6555d
23,discussion3," We hypothesize several mechanisms for failure of the KE to uniformly suppress myocardial glucose uptake in these healthy volunteers. Posttranslational protein acetylation and attenuation of insulin signaling are necessary for the efficient inhibition of the glucose transporter member 4 (GLUT4) translocation (13) and thus 18F-FDG accumulation in myocytes. In this sense, acute exogenous ketone delivery may not engender effective substrate competition and a “Randle Effect” in the healthy heart given normal mitochondrial function (7,14). For example, post-KE drink NEFA levels were significantly lower than that achieved by KD. In this way, the KD may be more effective because it feeds both ketones and fatty acids for substrate competition, leading to increased fatty acid oxidation and protein acetylation.",520fa7e5-088a-4b26-8bf1-a6e3668f0e22
24,discussion4," Second, failure of exogenous ketones could relate to increased insulin levels and, thus, signaling, an effect that can be counterproductive to achieving myocardial glucose suppression (MGS). Although, we did not find a relationship between post-KE insulin levels and myocardial glucose suppression (MGS). Third, the hemodynamic effect of exogenous ketones could theoretically contribute to increased myocardial glucose uptake, consistent with the vital sign changes in our study (11). Finally, the metabolic effect of exogenous ketone administration may be more dependent on the duration, rather than the peak levels, of ketosis before the “metabolic switch” occurs. In this sense, it remains to be proven whether extending the delay between KE and 18F-FDG administration would have led to improved suppression rates.  Notably, we found that ketone levels strongly predicted myocardial glucose suppression (MGS).",1ea833b2-d203-4ba8-b6ad-ab5f2f14542f
25,discussion5," Broadly speaking, ketogenesis is a complex process that is influenced by hormonal signaling (including insulin and glucagon levels), transcriptional regulation, and posttranscriptional modification (1). As the end result of several biologic processes that reflect the milieu of glucose regulation, it is not surprising that ketone levels significantly relate to myocardial glucose suppression (MGS). In our study, endogenous BHB levels had an area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of 0.88 for predicting myocardial glucose suppression (MGS), and a cutoff of 0.58 mmol/L accurately classified myocardial glucose suppression (MGS) 92% of the time.",3e799487-25a1-4454-906c-fa10e44980e3
26,discussion6," This predictive ability of BHB was stronger than those with insulin, glucagon, glucose, and NEFA, consistent with other studies that have found modest predictive ability for these biomarkers (15), and clarifies that ketosis is a more potent driver, or predictive biomarker, of myocardial glucose suppression (MGS) than these other metabolic processes. Such potent prediction has clinical implications, as BHB levels can be routinely assessed before 18F-FDG PET to ensure adequate patient preparation. For instance, we found that 86% of subjects with BHB levels < 0.58 mmol/L failed to make the metabolic switch, and oftentimes, the patterns of incomplete suppression were indistinguishable from inflammation (Fig. 5). Consequently, if BHB levels are below this threshold, a longer duration of the KD (e.g., 72 h) can be undertaken with the visit rescheduled.",494e63f3-ce4e-4a56-aa3c-fa405b9031b3
27,discussion7," Such an approach could considerably minimize false-positive or nondiagnostic scans, decreasing diagnostic uncertainty in clinical reading, inappropriate diagnoses, unnecessary costs, and radiation exposure from repeated scans. Alternatively, KE could be theoretically combined with the KD in participants below the threshold, since higher levels of ketosis after KE significantly predicted myocardial glucose suppression (MGS). Moreover, Point of Care (POC) ketone testing allows for rapid triage of patients and has already been implemented in other clinical settings (16). Such testing showed high agreement with laboratory-based analyses at levels encountered during KD and similarly predicted myocardial glucose suppression (MGS). Given the reasonable costs of ketone meters, it may be possible for patients to monitor ketone levels remotely before 18F-FDG PET, potentially avoiding unnecessary travel and improving clinical throughput if levels predict inadequate preparation.",9eae37ee-4cd9-4156-9b83-ca8be0af6ca2
28,discussion8," Importantly, however, further studies in cohorts of patients with heart failure will be needed given relative myocardial glucose avidity in the failing heart (1).  There are some limitations. Although we chose to study KE against an active comparator (KD, which is standard-of-care), a placebo (fasting-only) arm would have provided firm conclusions on whether KE (and not just prolonged fasting) did suppress myocardial glucose uptake in some participants. However, an additional arm would have engendered greater radiation exposure against a weak comparator, and historical data on myocardial glucose suppression (MGS) are available for fasting-only patient preparations (2). In addition, our sample size is modest.
