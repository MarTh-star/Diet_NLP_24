0,background0,"Therapeutic ketosis has been proven to be neuroprotective. Ketosis improves symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)-deficiency syndrome, autism, anxiety, depression, cancer, and epilepsy in patients and/or animal models [1–7]. The common problem with these disorders is that the cellular energetic status is compromised. The primary fuel source in a typical western (carbohydrate-based) diet is glucose, which is metabolized to yield acetyl-CoA, driving the citric acid cycle to produce adenosine triphosphate (adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) and other intermediates associated with neurotransmitter and energy balance. However, in the absence of dietary glucose, the liver mobilizes fatty acids for fuel, generating ketone bodies, such as beta-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) and acetoacetate, which can be transported to other tissues in the body [8–10].",33da1c03-1f38-4ca5-830a-6ed53524ab76
1,background1," The ketone bodies are then converted back to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria, allowing the citric acid cycle to continue generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to meet energy demands. Importantly, ketone bodies are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and provide fuel to the brain when dietary glucose is insufficient [8, 10]. An increase in ketone bodies, called ketosis, can be achieved with either a ketogenic diet (KD) or exogenous ketones [3–5, 10]. A state of ketosis enables cells to function efficiently by using both ketones and glucose.  It is unknown whether therapeutic ketosis would protect the nervous system from external harmful substances, such as toxic gases. Isoflurane (1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether) has been used as an inhalational anesthetic in patients for about 45 years [11]. However, it’s mechanism of action remains unknown.",7ae03c09-346f-4f88-a93f-4a2754f8c31b
2,background2," Although anesthesia and naturally occurring sleep are considered different states, it is a widely accepted theory that inhalational anesthetics may exert their anesthetic effects via endogenous neural circuitries and brain areas (e.g., cerebral cortex and/or ventrolateral preoptic area containing predominately sleep active, GABAergic and galaninergic neurons), which are also implicated in the modulation of naturally occurring sleep, generating a sleep-like state [12–15].  KD and exogenous ketone supplements can evoke sustained ketosis [2, 5], potentially modulating sleep and sleep-like effects [16–19]. No studies have been published on how ketosis might affect the onset of general isoflurane induced anesthesia.",b6a623ba-58c8-4394-9536-9bce9d12f482
3,background3," Based on anecdotal information, GLUT1 deficiency (G1D) syndrome patients -while on strict KD in order to elevate their blood ketone levels, since their brain is not able to use glucose as fuel-, have experienced delayed onset of anesthesia (personal communication with GLUT1D Foundation). In the present study we investigated whether nutritional ketosis induced by different methods can modulate the onset of isoflurane-induced anesthesia in animal models with and without pathology [20, 21]. Our methods included inducing ketosis in the animals sub-chronically (1 week) or chronically (10 weeks) either by ketogenic diet or with standard diet supplemented with ketone supplements. To investigate how animal models of different species and strains respond to isoflurane-evoked anesthetic induction while consuming the ketogenic diet or exogenous ketone supplements, we used one species of animal model without pathology and two species with pathology.",ca9d0db9-408c-402b-8d1c-73d7a85e8e65

We investigated the time until anesthetic induction, defined as the onset of immobility, a widely used measure of anesthetic potency [22] after administering 3% isoflurane.  This work is potentially clinically relevant since a ketosis-induced change in the latency to anesthesia may need to be considered when patients are undergoing anesthetic procedures (e.g., increased time prior to loss of consciousness before a medical procedure). It is also potentially relevant that ketosis-induced delay in the onset of anesthesia may indicate that ketosis may potentially also protects the nervous system from other, harmful gases.

17,discussion0,"Overall, each rodent model studied here (G1D mice, Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats and WAG/Rij rats) that received either a KD or a standard diet with exogenous ketone supplements exhibited elevated blood ketone levels and delayed onset of isoflurane-induced immobility.  General anesthesia involves multiple features, including amnesia, unconsciousness, analgesia and immobility [22]. The basis of anesthesia actions, produced for example by inhalational anesthetics such as isoflurane, is likely to involve modulation of different molecular and cellular targets of local, peripheral and central pathways [11]. Even though isoflurane is widely used in clinical practice, its exact mechanism and sites of action remain largely unknown. However, it was demonstrated that the main targets for anesthetic effect of isoflurane are the GABAA and NMDA receptors which generate neuronal inhibition and synaptic plasticity, respectively [15, 22–24].",8f1b2eb5-ede9-4a32-89ab-bacbbe380b56
18,discussion1," Moreover other receptors and ion channels are also implicated in isoflurane-evoked modulatory effects (e.g. hyperpolarization/inhibition, reduced bursting frequency of neurons, and decrease in neurotransmitter release), such as glycine receptors, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP)) channels, two-pore-domain ‘leak’ K+ channels, voltage gated Na+ channels, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN)) channels, and Ca2+ channels [11, 22, 25, 26]. By means of these receptors and ion channels, isoflurane may suppress excitatory synaptic transmission (e.g., by decrease in glutamate release) or/and may enhance inhibitory mechanisms/net inhibitory current, which processes may result in immobilization by depression of reflex pathways of the spinal cord [22].",b452e233-1bb5-44ef-9939-012425cbac5f
19,discussion2,"  Although physiological differences have been demonstrated between general anesthesia-induced sleep-like state and naturally occurring sleep, studies suggest that similar brain nuclei, neuronal networks, signaling pathways and neurotransmitters may be implicated in both processes [13, 15]. For example, a specific hypothalamic nucleus (ventrolateral preoptic area) of sleep-active neurons participates not only in sleep promotion, but also in the anesthetic effect of isoflurane: isoflurane increased depolarization and the firing rate of sleep-active neurons in this brain area by reduction of basal potassium conductance [12–14]. On the contrary, other authors suggest that isoflurane may exert its anesthetic influence by direct inhibition of the arousal system, neurons of motor systems and cerebral cortex rather than by indirect mechanisms (e.g., potentiation of sleep-active neurons of ventrolateral preoptic area) [27].",ff939c9f-593a-4ec2-bdf3-d8acfc742275
20,discussion3,"  The administration of the KD and exogenous ketone supplements results in ketosis (i.e., increase in βHB level), potentially leads to changes in sleep structure and time (e.g., decrease in total sleep time and increase in rapid eye movement/REM sleep time), which may be modulated, among others, via the ventrolateral preoptic area [4, 13, 18, 19]. As previous studies demonstrate the concentration, utilization and metabolism of ketone bodies may occur in a brain-region dependent manner [10, 16, 28]. As ketosis increases extracellular adenosine levels, as a consequence, it may evoke changes in neuronal activity by its receptors [17, 29]. According to previous studies adenosine also accumulates under certain conditions, such as sleep deprivation [13, 30]. In addition, the distribution of the adenosinergic system is uneven in the brain suggesting its different physiological/functional roles in different brain areas [29, 31].",c628b84c-dd2a-4256-b269-334df9a5fce1
21,discussion4," Therefore, it is possible that adenosine, as an endogenous homeostatic factor in sleep regulation, may be a link between the ketosis induced anesthetic delay. It has been demonstrated that adenosine increased the excitability of ventrolateral preoptic area neurons by disinhibition [32], a mechanism, by which adenosine may promote its sleep-eliciting processes. Increased level of adenosine may decrease the release of excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in the cerebral cortex and arousal system via inhibitory A1 type adenosine receptors (A1Rs) [27, 33] whereby adenosine may facilitate the anesthetic effects of isoflurane. Nevertheless, not only A1Rs, but also excitatory A2A type adenosine receptors (A2ARs) are implicated in sleep-wake regulation, which A2ARs may increase the level of excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain [17, 29, 34] and may modify the anesthetic effects of isoflurane. As the influence of adenosine receptors on sleep-wake cycle is brain region-dependent (e.g.",85691f38-40f4-4feb-84b4-634947602585
22,discussion5,", activation of A1Rs may generate both sleep and wakefulness depending on affected brain areas) [34] it is possible that KD and exogenous ketone supplementation may moderate the anesthetic effect of isoflurane by adenosine and its receptors. Based on these results, we can hypothesize that ketogenic diet and exogenous ketogenic supplements caused a delay in the onset of isoflurane-induced immobility possibly involving changes in adenosine-generated modulatory effects in different brain areas implicated in anesthetic effects.  The role of other neurotransmitter systems (e.g., GABAergic system), ion channels (e.g., Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) and Ca2+ channels) and other mechanisms of action of both isoflurane and ketosis/ketone bodies (e.g., bioenergetics or/mitochondrial changes) has been assumed in KD- and exogenous ketone supplementation-evoked influences on isoflurane-generated anesthetic effects [11, 24, 35, 36].",28a646a5-3a40-4dfb-8464-f40665254861
23,discussion6," Consequently, the modulatory effect of KD and exogenous ketone supplements on the onset of isoflurane-generated anesthesia/immobility by not only adenosinergic pathways, but also other signaling pathways cannot be excluded. Moreover, delay in anesthesia induction evoked by KD and exogenous ketogenic supplements, which strongly correlated with the elevation of the blood βHB levels, suggest that nutritional ketosis may exert its effect on processes of anesthesia by delay of isoflurane anesthesia-evoked suppression of metabolic activity in neural networks [11]. Therefore, further studies are needed to reveal the exact mechanism of action of KD, and ketone supplements on isoflurane- (and other inhalational anesthetics) generated effects.  It has been demonstrated previously that WAG/Rij rats and G1D mice showed higher basal βHB levels compared to Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats and wild type mice, respectively [4, 21].",e5823439-97b3-448a-b339-1b435afac222
24,discussion7," Moreover, G1D animals also showed βHB levels lower then WAG/Rij rats, while the increase in βHB levels after sub-chronic ketone supplementation (KE and KS) were higher in WAG/Rij rats compared to Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats. These results suggest that basal ketone levels and ketone supplements-evoked increase in blood βHB levels may be connected to either putative species-dependent differences or pathological conditions, such as epileptic seizures. However, in spite of different physiological (e.g., basal βHB level) and pathophysiological (e.g., spike-wave discharges/SWDs) conditions, KD and exogenous ketone supplementation generated similar delay in onset of isoflurane-generated anesthesia (immobility) in all of three rodent strains with (G1D mice and WAG/Rij rats) and without (Sprague Dawley (SPD) rats) pathology.",6a2d49ed-ee5a-4e1d-b17e-287353b47d87
25,discussion8,"  Our result suggests that the ketogenic diet and exogenous ketone supplementation-induced ketosis may have similar effects on the anesthetic response to isoflurane independent from the method of inducing ketosis, species studied (mice and rats) and presence (or lack of) of pathology. The ability of influencing the speed of inhalation induction may be important in clinical settings, for example, to delay induction in cyanotic children and in those with right-to-left shunts because in these patients the decreased pulmonary flow limits the rate of increase of the concentration of inhalational anesthetics in the arterial blood [37]. These results imply that the state of ketosis or these specific treatments may enhance neuroprotection from other harmful gases as well, therefore it is possible that achieving the state of ketosis might provide protection from toxic gases to first responders or military personnel, however further studies are needed to validate this hypothesis.",494d2ded-c158-4118-812a-65de43ca2609
26,discussion9," Additional applications of these results could be considered and should be further explored. Nitrogen narcosis is a drowsy state induced by breathing air under high pressure in recreational or military divers producing anesthetic-like influence, resulting in temporarily impaired cognitive function, or even unconsciousness [38–41]. Since the mechanism of action in nitrogen narcosis is considered similar to anesthesia, achieving ketosis could also potentially delay its onset or mitigate negative consequences, but further studies are needed to confirm the potential effectiveness for such specific applications. Moreover, delaying the onset of anesthesia by nutritional ketosis or fasting ketosis may influence anesthetic procedures that surgeons and anesthesiologists need to consider prior to loss of consciousness for a medical procedure.",4b1acf5c-b7f8-44cb-8e1a-45527c5439fd
27,discussion10,"  Conclusion The results of the present study suggest that KD- and exogenous ketone supplements-evoked nutritional ketosis can provide increased resistance to an anesthetic gas, such as isoflurane by delaying the onset of anesthesia. Further studies are warranted to determine the putative effect of ketogenic diet- and exogenous ketone supplements-evoked nutritional ketosis on other inhalational and intravenous anesthetics, as well as other harmful gases (such as carbon monoxide and volcanic gases) or chemical weapons/warfare-induced sleep-like effects [42, 43]. In addition, the ketosis induced influences on sleep-like effects will require further examination in human subjects, as such findings can have clinical and surgical relevance. Our results further suggest that it might be important to monitor blood ketone levels in humans undergoing inhalational anesthesia as this knowledge might prove helpful for the anesthesia provider.",2130e381-fd4a-4ec2-b078-f9af6a3cf8f8
