0,results0,"Our primary hypothesis was that there would be an increased level of reporting of remission/significant mood stabilisation/some mood stabilisation among those adhering to a ketogenic diet compared with the two ‘control’ dietary regimens. We identified 165 posts relating to a ketogenic diet, 73 related to omega-3 supplementation and 21 related to a vegetarian diet. As there were only 21 posts related to a vegetarian diet we combined the responses to either vegetarian or omega-3 supplemented diets in the results below. Despite online speculation and discourse on possible benefit, there is to our knowledge, no credible evidence of an association between a vegetarian diet and bipolar disorder whereas there exists a body of published research on omega-3 supplementation that supports a possible association so the data is also provided separately by type of diet.",f1681c73-678f-4885-bdaa-1498a6948a4c

There were a higher proportion of reports of ‘any improvement in mood stabilisation’ with a ketogenic diet compared with the other two diets: 127 (84.1%, 95% CI 77.3–89.5) v. 19 (47.5%, 95% CI 31.5–63.9; χ² = 23.40, P < 0.0001).

There were a substantially higher proportion of reports of ‘symptom remission’ with a ketogenic diet compared with the other two diets: 18 (11.9%, 95% CI 7.2–18.2) v. 1 (2.5%, 95% CI 1.0–13.2; χ² = 3.1, P = 0.08) but this did not reach statistical significance, likely due to the relatively small number of reports.  When looking in detail at the posts on a ketogenic diet it is clear that some experienced a definite effect within 3–7 days of starting the diet. There are reports of some mood destabilisation in a few (5.3%, 95% CI 2.3–10.2) individuals but this is not significantly different to the level reported with the other two diets (10.0%, 95% CI 2.8–23.7).",d2e93cce-e388-4029-ae22-8e462a3d49d7

Thus, a significantly higher proportion of those on a ketogenic diet reported extended periods of remission of symptoms. More than 95% of these reports of ‘remission of symptoms’ came from the ketogenic diet group. Some of these posts included those that reported details of very significant improvements, which had a significant impact on the quality of life of those reporting them.",451adf29-9325-41c4-b530-581b09f6a9e0

There was no difference in the reporting of deterioration in mood stabilisation.  There were a higher proportion of reports of ‘any improvement in mood stabilisation’ and of ‘remission or significant improvement in mood stabilisation’ with a ketogenic diet compared with the omega-3 supplemented diet and with the vegetarian diet (see Table 3).  There were reports of mood destabilisation associated with a ketogenic diet in 8 of 165 (4.8%, 95% CI 2.1–9.3) of individuals.

6,results9," Some of these reports noted that the destabilisation occurred after discontinuing medication after achieving positive results with a ketogenic diet.  Plausibility of diagnosis From the information given in the posts of 85 individuals we judged that 64 (75.3%, 95% CI 64.7–84.0) were very likely (n = 49) or likely (n = 15) to have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Of 24 individuals who reported a subtype of bipolar disorder, 16 (66.7%, 95% CI 44.7–84.4) mentioned type II and 8 (33.3%, 95% CI 15.6–55.3) reporting having type I.  Plausibility of achieving ketosis From the reports of experience with a ketogenic diet we judged that of 85 individuals 79 (92.9%, 95% CI 85.3–97.4) were very likely (n = 52) or likely (n = 27) to have achieved a state of ketosis. Nineteen (22.4%, 95% CI 14.0–32.7) individuals noted that there was an adaptation period before positive effects of the diet were found.",28eb5427-9cae-41ef-b83b-d38a439ada7c
7,results12," Other reports of benefit were for periods of up to 1 month (5 posts), from 1 up to 3 months (14 posts) or from 3 to 5 months (6 posts).  Many of the forum posts reported clear histories of bipolar disorder and receiving medical treatment, including periods of admission to hospital. Reports included those of dramatic reductions of symptoms to an ‘asymptomatic’ condition, or ‘cure,’ or ‘complete reduction of all symptoms,’ or ‘life-changing’ levels of relief. Reports also detailed the ability to perform important life tasks that were previously not possible. Some reported mood stability exceeding that previously achieved on medication or leading to reductions in or cessation of previous medication. Length of improved mood stabilisation was often reported to be for months to years (with 8 years being the longest period reported). ",88802ff1-2895-4fbf-94b0-85470f491cbb
8,discussion0,"Main findings This observational analytic study of bipolar disorder online forums provides some preliminary support for the hypothesis that a ketogenic diet can have beneficial effects on mood stabilisation that can be long lasting. The study is based on self-reports and individual experience and so bipolar disorder diagnosis and mood response cannot be confirmed by expert review and also online reports may be subject to considerable reporting bias. Nevertheless, reports of patient experience are an important health outcome and are valid in themselves. Furthermore, this controlled study sought to minimise biases by adopting a control group, having independent review of text comments, adopting partial masking of assessment and replicating findings in a separate study.",33fee5ec-fc25-4542-83af-377d15e6ca3d
9,discussion1,  In assessing forum reports we only included those reports based on direct personal experience and excluded second-hand reports of experience of other people and reports in which people stated what they had read about or believed would happen. There was a higher level of improvement in mood stabilisation with a ketogenic diet compared with the omega-3 diet and vegetarian diets (and compared with a group of those on either of these ‘control diets’). The difference was particularly marked among those reporting ‘remission or significant improvement in mood stabilisation’ (56.4% v. 14.9%) and with remission of symptoms (12.1% v. 1.1%). The difference in the quality and detail in the reporting of improvements was striking with more detailed reports of benefits in the ketogenic diet group. There was a tendency for the improvement in mood stabilisation to be greater among those whose dietary report included details that suggested that they had achieved a ketotic state.,62260f1a-7a22-4086-9471-d2ed4b242440
10,discussion2," These findings were not confined to one online forum community as data from the independent data mining of other online forums (study 2) yielded similar levels of reporting of mood stabilisation and replicated the study 1 forum reports of improved mood stabilisation associated with a ketogenic diet.  Study limitations There are a number of limitations in this study. Forum posts are subjective reports that may be influenced by media reports and peer factors. For this reason, we adopted a control group consisting of other proposed dietary interventions for bipolar disorder (omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and a vegetarian diet) but this may have not controlled adequately for these biases. Forum posts may be influenced strongly by previous (favourable or adverse) posts on a specific forum giving a ‘culture’ on that forum that favours certain types of response. We attempted to mitigate this possible effect by looking at posts across more than one forum.",752178f7-7306-40f4-8671-8de2b7c2fe4c
11,discussion3," Our findings suggest that these reports of mood stabilisation with a ketogenic diet were not confined only to selected online forums. The bipolar disorder diagnosis was self-reported and may have been inaccurate in some cases. We made an assessment of our confidence in the diagnosis (with defined criteria) and found that the bipolar disorder diagnosis was ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’ in 75% of individuals who reported effects of ketogenic diet. This is a subjective assessment but based on explicit criteria (defined a priori) given in the paper. Adherence to the three diets under study was variable and challenging to assess from the reports. Nevertheless, we judged that the great majority (93%) of forum posts from those reporting a ketogenic diet were from individuals who had successfully achieved a state of ketosis.",5d4a20e1-8d4a-4586-9db0-488b04d8bc28
12,discussion4," It is possible that some of the benefits reported were short term and, in a condition characterised by remissions and relapses, this might not give reliable information about true benefits. We assessed this by looking at reported duration of benefit and found this to be >6 months in about 40% of reports where information on duration was given. In addition, the magnitude and prolonged duration of the benefit noted by some participants suggests that this is not a minor transient benefit, at least for a significant proportion of individuals. However, these interpretations of the data may be incorrect in some cases. We present these findings as a hypothesis-generating study that clearly needs to be investigated further, ideally by means of an experimental study such as a clinical trial, as detailed above.",c4311e9e-4a6a-484b-b751-ce4c1d241e9b
13,discussion5,"  Putative mechanisms The suggested mechanisms of action of a ketogenic diet broadly fall under two broad categories: mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations of neuronal intracellular sodium and calcium.  Mitochondrial dysfunction The evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in bipolar disorder has been summarised by Kato17 and Kim et al.10 Impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid (tricarboxylic acid (TCA)) cycle is a key component with increased levels of pyruvate from glycolysis suggesting an impaired ability to utilise pyruvate within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.18 In a state of ketosis, high plasma levels of ketones such as beta-hydroxybutyrate act as an alternative energy source and can supply acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-coA) directly to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle providing an alternative pathway to that from pyruvate (see Fig. 1).",ecc7bd8d-8e34-4079-b0e5-ddbba833ef25
14,discussion6," The reports of the positive effects of a ketogenic diet on mood stabilisation in bipolar disorder are consistent with a reduced formation of acetyl-coA from pyruvate that is bypassed by this alternative source of acetyl-CoA from ketones. This, in turn, implies reduced activity of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)) or reduced carriage of intracellular pyruvate transport across the mitochondrial membrane by mitochondrial carrier proteins (mitochondrial carrier proteins (MPC)) (see Fig. 1). Metabolomic studies have demonstrated disruption of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in bipolar disorder and have reported increased levels of pyruvate18 but are not clear about the biochemical antecedents of these findings. Our study findings support the hypothesis that improved mood stabilisation is associated with a ketogenic diet.",bbc57ae5-5c7b-40ad-9c79-51a9d5c4bfdc
15,discussion7," If true, this provides new information that may help understand the nature of the underlying biochemical mechanism and is consistent with reduced activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and/or mitochondrial carrier proteins (MPC) being important in some patients with bipolar disorder.19 To investigate this hypothesis further would require further detailed metabolomics studies of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bipolar disorder, including those who are adhering to a ketogenic diet and have high levels of plasma beta ketones. Fig. 1 Simplified diagram of how ketone bodies such as d-beta-hydroxybutyrate may bypass a block in the link between glycolysis (pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-coA)) in the cytoplasm and the tricarboxylic acid (tricarboxylic acid (TCA)) cycle in mitochondrion.  pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), pyruvate dehydrogenase; βHB, beta-hydroxybutyrate.",eda4539f-0e2f-4ef2-bffa-c5dbd6e5886a
16,discussion8,"  Reduction of intracellular sodium and calcium Bostock et al point to reduction of intracellular sodium and calcium as an important mechanism of action for mood stabilisation on a ketogenic diet.20 Phelps et al11 notes that successful mood stabilising medications reduce intracellular sodium in an activity-dependent manner and that this can also be achieved through acidification of the blood on a ketogenic diet. Phelps and colleagues hypothesise that in the ketotic state extracellular protons in acidified blood are exchanged with intracellular sodium thereby preventing excessive intracellular sodium accumulation. It is also possible that reduced intracellular sodium occurs as a downstream effect of restored mitochondrial function. El-Mallakh notes that conditions of reduced mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production may lead directly to altered sodium and calcium dynamics in neurons mediated by reduced Na,K–adenosine triphosphate (ATP)ase activity.",d67e3656-6529-4216-88af-375434af3c57
17,discussion9,21 This hypothesis may provide insight into a mechanism underlying both the mounting evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction and the altered sodium/calcium levels typically observed.  Implications Despite inherent limitations of observational data based on self-reports posted online this controlled observational analytic study of bipolar disorder online forums gives support to the hypothesis that a ketogenic diet can have beneficial effects on self-reported mood stabilisation.22 These findings are consistent with a mitochondrial dysfunction component to bipolar disease aetiology. The effect could be mediated by ketones bypassing a block in the linkage between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle because of reduced activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase or mitochondrial pyruvate carriage. Ketone ester compounds are now available that replicate the high ketonaemia found in those following a ketogenic diet.,16b2ac4b-18d8-4db4-ac87-f2ff16473666
18,discussion10,23 Adoption of a ketogenic diet or use of ketone esters (if these are shown to have an adequate safety profile for such use) could be investigated further for their potential use in clinical trials to investigate this hypothesis further.
