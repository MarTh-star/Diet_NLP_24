Follow-up visits were scheduled according to the standard practice of the site and per the treating physician's best judgement, but at minimum intervals of 12 months. Data were retrieved from clinical records, electronic medical records, individuals' questionnaires, and ad-hoc clinical databases. Research projects were designed to record additional, more detailed data related to specific disease manifestations [i.e., subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA)), renal angiomyolipoma, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, genetics, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND), QoL, and epilepsy].",72533d68-92f0-425d-bd38-e94fff8b96eb

Investigators, specialized in epilepsy care, from 27 sites across nine countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Japan, and Turkey) participated in the epilepsy substudy.  Given the observational nature of the study, both diagnostic and treatment/management were performed according to local best practice. The study protocol, therefore, did not request any particular additional clinical or laboratory investigations.

Data Analyses  From the main study, we present epilepsy characteristics, emphasizing changes in the rates of epilepsy diagnosis, treatment, and outcome over time. From the epilepsy substudy, we report characteristics [age of onset, frequency, tuber numbers, treatments and treatments outcomes, and intelligence quotient (IQ) level] of individuals with infantile spasms and focal seizures and correlated them to genotype. We report the impact of epilepsy characteristics and EEG foci on intellectual ability, date of EEG compared to the date of the seizure onset in individuals with focal seizures and infantile spasms with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) diagnosis prior to seizure onset, number of Antiepileptic drug (AED)s used at epilepsy diagnosis, and the reasons for changes in the Antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen.",30f3ca41-0330-493d-8fb1-1f70d7d6100c

The response of individuals with infantile spasms was defined as follows: spasm-free + hypsarrhythmia resolved + normalized EEG or spasms free with disappearance of hypsarrhythmia, but persistent EEG anomalies. Efficacy in focal seizures was defined as >50% decrease in seizure frequency with rates of seizure freedom and response of >75%.

Vigabatrin (Vigabatrin (VGB)) was the most commonly used antiepileptic drugs (Antiepileptic drug (AED)s). Individuals with infantile spasms showed a higher treatment response over time with lower usage of steroids. Individuals with focal seizures reported similar rates of drug resistance (32.5–43.3%). Use of vagus nerve stimulation (vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)), ketogenic diet, and surgery remained low.

Use of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) was first reported in the late 1980s in patients with infantile spasms. Use of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) showed a peak at the beginning of the 2000s (reported in 6% of individuals with infantile spasms and 7.8% in those with focal seizures), but there was a clear decrease thereafter. In contrast, the ketogenic diet showed a slow increase since its first use in this cohort but did not exceed 9% for infantile spasms and 12% for focal seizures.

9,results9,"  Over time, individuals with infantile spasms responded better to treatment than those with focal seizures (Table 2); those with infantile spasms achieved a high response rate with a plateau since the late 1990s. This correlated to an increased use of Vigabatrin (VGB) and a decreased use of steroids (Figure 2, Table 2). Outcome of focal seizures did not vary much since the 1960s, plateauing between 56 and 64% (Table 2).

16,discussion1," Vigabatrin improved the outcome of infantile spasms and should be used as first-line treatment. There is, however, still a need for improving therapies in focal seizures. Electroencephalogram follow-up prior to seizure-onset should be promoted for all infants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in order to facilitate preventive or early treatment.  epilepsy registry to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA) tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tuberous sclerosis complex Novartis Pharma10.13039/100008792 ==== Body pmcIntroduction  Epilepsy is a common manifestation of tuberous sclerosis complex (tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)), affecting 80–90% of individuals (1, 2). It usually presents during the first year of life with infantile (epileptic) spasms or focal seizures. Focal seizures remain the most frequent type after the first year of life, but individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) may develop almost all seizure types.",87d31db8-5ed3-44a0-ac4e-10c1ac88fd73
17,discussion2," In about two-thirds of individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), seizures are refractory to anticonvulsant treatment (3), a much higher proportion than the 23% reported in the general epilepsy population (4). Epilepsy is associated with a wide range of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND)) including intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (autism spectrum disorder (ASD)), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)), as well as impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (5–9).  Treatment options for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated epilepsy in the first year of life are specific to infantile spasms because of high rates and individuals' responsiveness to vigabatrin (Vigabatrin (VGB)), a first-line treatment option.",a78b12e1-ea14-4681-b053-7611cef8cecb
18,discussion3," Antiepileptic drug (Antiepileptic drug (AED)) recommendations in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) after the age of 1 year are the same as in the general epilepsy population based on seizure types. Candidates for epilepsy surgery should be identified early in the course of the disease. Other non-pharmacological treatment options including ketogenic diet, and vagus nerve stimulation (vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)) should also be considered early if the epilepsy is refractory (10). Evidence supports the use of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-inhibitors as adjunctive treatment to Antiepileptic drug (AED)s for treating focal epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) individuals, with a higher response rate in the younger subgroup aged below 6 years (11–13).",2a52ee51-d257-4f37-98dd-f198bc1057c4
19,discussion4," Given the early onset, severity and significant impact of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated epilepsy on quality of life (QoL) (3, 5, 6), there is value in longitudinal population-based studies of detailed epilepsy characteristics.  The TuberOus Sclerosis registry to increase disease Awareness (to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA)), which included individuals from 170 sites in 31 countries, was conceived to expand our understanding of different tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) manifestations, treatment patterns, and outcomes (14). TuberOus Sclerosis registry to increase disease Awareness consisted of a main study representing the diagnostic characteristics and associated clinical features, and six substudies, each focusing on specific tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) manifestations. In our initial publication, we reported characteristics of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated epilepsies (2).",d31002f2-d769-4cf5-bd46-8ebcde095347
20,discussion5," The key observations were (a) a typical onset pattern of focal seizures and infantile spasms in the first two years of life, (b), high rates of drug resistance in focal seizures compared to infantile spasms, and (c) a low proportion of individuals treated with non-pharmacological therapies, including epilepsy surgery. Here, we present data from the to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA) final analysis, describing rates of epilepsy, treatment interventions, and outcomes over time. We also report findings from the epilepsy substudy, a to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA) research project, aimed at reporting more detailed epilepsy characteristics including time to epilepsy diagnosis, electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns, and therapies.   This study provides final data or information on epilepsy characteristics in a large cohort of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) individuals who participated in the to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA) registry and in the epilepsy substudy.",f2ebdb09-2faf-4f4f-a721-e28a61cdbbdc
21,discussion6,"  Findings from the main study emphasize the changes in both diagnosis and treatment patterns of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated epilepsies over time. Overall, a diagnosis of epilepsy was reported in approximately 85% of all individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) included, equally affecting both sexes. Infantile spasms were reported in about 39% of individuals with a median age of <1 year at diagnosis, and focal seizures in two-thirds of the individuals with a median age of 1 year at diagnosis. These findings were consistent with our previous report and also with other studies (2, 3, 15–17).  In our study, epilepsy diagnosis rates, especially diagnosis of infantile spasms, were higher in younger individuals (67.8% in 1970s to 91.8% in last decade).",a2dd13a0-fd02-465d-8968-c97dfc1d8c38
22,discussion7," Since infantile spasms were reported as the seizures types of West syndrome by William West in 1841 (18), followed by Gibbs and Gibbs' description of the characteristic EEG pattern of hypsarrhythmia in 1952 (19), clinicians have made remarkable progress in recognizing this syndrome. The first proposal of classification of patients with epilepsies in syndromes published in the “Guide Bleu” (Blue Guide) in 1984 added to this knowledge (20). In addition, the better recognition of infantile spasms in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and their focal nature might have changed the delineation of focal seizures and infantile spasms in the recent years. Although we believe that there was an improvement in the diagnosis of infantile spasms and that this major improvement in clinical epileptology guarantees earlier and better seizure and developmental outcomes.",cc66dde1-a5e4-4566-abc3-05f7dc847ef5
23,discussion8," We should be cautious about the concept of an increased rate of epilepsy diagnosis because older individuals in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) clinics often have a lower rate of epilepsy as they present with angiomyolipoma or being the parent of a child with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).  Our data showed a better treatment response rate in individuals with infantile spasms over time, but not in those with focal seizures. This seems to be due to Vigabatrin (VGB) specifity in infants with West syndrome and its growing usage since the 1990s. A decrease in the use of steroids after Vigabatrin (VGB) also clearly shows the specific efficacy of Vigabatrin (VGB) and the lack of a need to add steroids as practiced in infantile spasms due to other etiologies (21). Vigabatrin is an established first-line therapy for individuals with infantile spasms (10, 22).",0dbdc52a-e166-4156-b846-4177f1d16df8
24,discussion9," This precision medicine approach in individuals with infantile spasms in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a major example of how an early diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) can help to better target the therapy and to avoid therapeutic failures and ineffective polytherapies. In addition, Vigabatrin (VGB) is recommended as first-line treatment for focal seizures in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in the first year of life (10), aiming to prevent transition into infantile spasms. However, its use for focal seizures in older individuals does not seem to be superior to other Antiepileptic drug (AED)s licensed for focal seizures. Indeed, there has been no change in responder rates for focal seizures for the past 45 years despite availability of over 30 new Antiepileptic drug (AED)s (23, 24).",addc4e1d-c837-45f5-bc75-c05ae3006d10
25,discussion10," This finding is also in line with the high percentage of drug resistance reported in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated focal seizures in recent reports (3, 25). Despite the high response to Vigabatrin (VGB) in individuals with infantile spasms, it was not always the first therapy in individuals with infantile spasms (only 45% received Vigabatrin (VGB) as first-line monotherapy). This finding is unexpected, especially in epilepsy centers, but emphasizes the need for more education about the use of individualized treatment options for specific etiologies.  Surprisingly, other non-pharmacological therapies such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and the ketogenic diet were not used in this highly drug resistant population (range 1.5–8.6%). This might be due to the lack of randomized controlled trials in both therapies and evidence often based on retrospective small series (26) from one hand and the lack of expertise in both therapies on the other hand.",ea455c7c-9e44-4cff-88b1-d8bbf8693510
26,discussion11," The use of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in this cohort decreased during recent years after a peak in the 2000 and might be still underused although recommended as last resort in patients with refractory seizures.  Early evaluation for epilepsy surgery candidates in individuals with drug resistant tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated epilepsies should be performed in expert centers in order to prevent/minimize developmental consequences of ongoing seizures (27). In our study, only a few individuals had epilepsy surgery. However, we did not ask in the study protocol how many had undergone pre-surgical evaluation.  Epilepsy surgery shows a relevant rate of 8–10% in our study but might not reflect yet the number of patients that were good candidates for epilepsy surgery and that can benefit from such therapy. Additionally, not all of the epilepsy centers participating in the study were also surgery centers trained in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated epilepsy.",7664b514-036e-42b0-9f3f-b59e9c840471
27,discussion12," Therefore, additional training and education are needed and additional collaboration with expert surgery centers should be established for individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in order to promote early identification of surgery good candidates.  Individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and epilepsy are prescribed with multiple Antiepileptic drug (AED)s or undergo multiple surgical procedures to manage epileptic seizures (28, 29). However, we have observed in our epilepsy substudy that a large number of individuals were initiated on Antiepileptic drug (AED) monotherapies as recommended by the ILAE (International League Against Epilesy). This might be related to the use of Vigabatrin (VGB) in the first year of life in both infantile spasms and focal seizures or epilepsy combining both seizure types.  Our results also showed the increased use of disease-modifying treatment with mTOR inhibitors.",c8161fa7-5930-4a7d-8586-174fe697deb9
28,discussion13," The efficacy of this therapy was reported in late 2010 and its use in case of failure of initial treatment could be the rational approach. Its use increased and reached 18% in the last reports from the to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA) study in 2015, showing the need for more efficient therapies in focal seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). This increased use of approved mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, and the wider evaluation of surgery candidates in the management of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated focal seizures and in some individuals with drug-resistant infantile spasms might improve responder rates in the future and could help to achieve a better cognitive tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) outcomes.  In our substudy, in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) diagnosis prior to seizure onset, EEG was performed mainly after the onset of clinical seizures, both for infantile spasms (in 68.",ef9fb406-6a31-4e2f-b291-3397fff9dfed
29,discussion14,"8%) and focal seizures (in 58.3%). Curatolo et al. recommended in 2012 (22) and later in 2018 (10) to use EEG in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) before seizure onset to early identify individuals at high risk of developing epilepsy. This was also reported in the international recommendations (guidelines) in 2013 (30), based on studies showing that tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) individuals who were diagnosed and treated before the onset of seizures had less severe epilepsy and better neurodevelopmental outcomes (31). Abnormal EEG patterns and/or in some instances subclinical seizures recorded on the EEG should urge the use of Antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy without waiting for the onset of overt clinical seizures.",834af48c-cd24-4ef4-ac56-999a0973afa7
30,discussion15," The results of the research project are in contrast with these recommendations and emphasize the need for more information for clinicians about the key role of sequential EEG recordings to early recognize individuals at high risk of developing early onset seizures and preventive Antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. Parents should be educated to recognize seizures earlier and most importantly EEG recordings should be performed—with an ultrasound of cardiac rhabdomyoma, pre-natal, or post-natal MRIs—in cases with family history of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with signs of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) or with cutaneous hallmarks of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).  The place of this pre-symptomatic diagnosis strategy for epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and the preventive therapy might be better implemented after the recent validation of this approach with the first results of the EPISTOP study (32, 33).",ab7494da-cdab-4c83-9ad8-5c4718c3602e
31,discussion16," Individuals receiving early preventive treatment showed a later epilepsy onset and a less severe epilepsy compared to those receiving standard therapy started after the onset of clinical seizures. The cognitive outcome might need further validation and longer follow-up (32, 33).  Our data show no significant correlation between the spikes focus and the IQ levels as for frontal or temporal focus. More severe cognitive but mainly psychiatric disorders as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are reported with temporal lesions (34). However, we did not report autism spectrum disorder (ASD) testing and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) results were mostly missing.  Finally, our study showed that individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 had less severe phenotypes than those with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)2.",b4d4f294-a827-4bf0-8e9d-05ebf6477e49
32,discussion17," This finding is in accordance with the literature (3, 25, 35), but, importantly, we were able to validate it on a very large cohort probably less biased than mono-center studies and smaller series. A higher proportion of individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 had normal IQ levels than those with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)2. Compared to individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)2, they had fewer numbers of tubers, later onset of epilepsy, and higher rates of controlled seizures. The tuber load, usually higher in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)2, might have a role in creating more complex and diffuse abnormal networks, with fewer regions showing normal brain cortex, leading more frequently to drug resistant epilepsy and higher rates of co-morbidities.",5f4b447f-cc27-4942-a045-5510d6e06aea
33,discussion18,"  In conclusion, our study highlights that despite the improvement in diagnosis and in some aspects of treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated epilepsy over time, especially for infantile spasms, there are still some major improvements to be made. Better epilepsy control is urgently needed, mainly for focal seizures. A more targeted use of available therapies and the promotion of innovative therapies and of evaluating surgery candidates should continue. Despite the established guidelines, the need for further education of clinicians in order to provide earlier diagnosis of epilepsy based on serial EEGs before the onset of seizures in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) should be promoted and to use Vigabatrin (VGB) as first monotherapy for infantile spasms established as the first line therapy.",04b94d3a-7482-4782-8526-0904ea2af9be
34,discussion19," Pre-seizure diagnosis will also help to use timely or even preventive therapies and could be a major step toward changing the natural history of epilepsy in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Finally, the use of new targeted therapies such as mTOR inhibitors, or cannabidiol (36), and earlier and better definition of candidates for epilepsy surgery may lead to better outcomes, especially for focal seizures where the seizure control rates have plateaued in the last decade.  to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA) Investigators  Japan: Nobuo Shinohara, Shigeo Horie, Masaya Kubota, Jun Tohyama, Katsumi Imai, Mari Kaneda, Hideo Kaneko, Yasushi Uchida, Tomoko Kirino, Shoichi Endo, Yoshikazu Inoue, Katsuhisa Uruno; Turkey: Ayse Serdaroglu, Zuhal Yapici, Banu Anlar, Sakir Altunbasak; Russia: Olga Lvova, Oleg Valeryevich Belyaev, Oleg Agranovich, Elena Vladislavovna Levitina, Yulia Vladimirovna Maksimova, Antonina Karas; China: Yuwu Jiang, Liping Zou, Kaifeng Xu, Yushi Zhang,",60c73f0d-21b9-42d3-a5e0-f4c6663c491d
