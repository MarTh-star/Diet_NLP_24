0,discussion0," By reviewing and citing the available literature in detail, this brief article clearly identifies the discrepancies in previous studies and provides several practical recommendations on how to consume medium chain triglycerides (MCT)s to maximize their ketogenic benefits. However, in addition to the effects of their metabolites (i.e., ketones), C8 and C10 have been shown to directly improve neural function. For instance, C8 regulates the energy balance by affecting the activity of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons [(28) (Sec3.4)]; C10 enhances mitochondrial function in neurons by activating the SIRT1 enzyme [(29) (Sec3.3.2)] and regulates astrocyte function by inhibiting mTOR [(30) (R12, F7)]; and both C8 and C10 increase neuronal GABA synthesis by increasing the glutamine supply [(31) (R5, F5)]. Thus, the optimal dose and composition of medium chain triglycerides (MCT)s may differ from previous recommendations and from those provided hereafter in the light of other relevant factors.",e686d283-d13c-41fa-8f5a-57bcde49a428
1,discussion1,"  As participants with diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease may have different metabolic responses, we only included studies on healthy participants. Healthy adults and elderly individuals do not seem to show major differences in their ketogenic responses to medium chain triglycerides (MCT)s [(13) (R1, F1)]. However, further investigations of the ketogenic effect of medium chain triglycerides (MCT)s in different populations are necessary.
