0,introduction0,"More important than overall body weight, in overweight individuals and patients with obesity, the distribution of fat is strongly associated with the metabolic disturbances that lead to comorbidities (1, 2). Visceral adipose tissue (visceral adipose tissue (VAT)) accumulation is associated with increased peripheral insulin resistance and often a systemic low-grade chronic inflammatory state, known as lipoinflammation (3–5). Similarly, liver fat accumulation, in this context called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)), is also associated with peripheral insulin resistance and a local inflammatory response, resulting in prolonged hepatocellular injury (6). Ultimately, the vicious cycle installed between these fat depots and secondary metabolic derangements may lead to organ damage and high cardiovascular risk in individuals with obesity.",b36efe9f-2775-4c2c-b7e5-1358ca1979fc
1,introduction1,"  non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease worldwide, with a prevalence still in a rise proportionally with the rise in obesity, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy dietary pattern, and metabolic syndrome (7). In a proportion of these patients, the presence of chronic hepatic inflammation leads to more advanced forms of disease, i.e., non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis, with the potential of liver failure and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (8). Currently, the first-line treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) consists of weight loss and lifestyle modifications such as physical exercise and dietary regimens based on calorie restriction (9, 10). However, lifestyle interventions including standard low-calorie (LC) diets and exercise often do not achieve significant enough weight loss to reverse the fat accumulation in the liver (6, 11).",124d1ee1-47cf-4aa3-9ffc-1af74ec80b20
2,introduction2," To date, there is still a paucity of effective targeted or specific therapies for non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (6, 12). Alternatively, bariatric surgery promotes effective weight loss capable of improving fat deposition in the liver and in the visceral compartment, although with some risk of surgical complications, particularly in patients with comorbidities (13–15). Very LC ketogenic diet (Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)) has been proposed as an effective weight loss intervention potentially suitable for the treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and for the reduction of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), which may be beneficial to reduce the state of insulin resistance and end-organ damage (16–18).  Magnetic resonance imaging (Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) has been shown as an accurate method for measuring visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver fat in clinical practice and in clinical trials (19–21).",78067243-9e38-41cf-bbd6-c8fc53cfe0c1
3,introduction3," It also allows the estimation of liver stiffness, a non-invasive biomarker that correlates to liver inflammation and fibrosis (22, 23). The aim of this study was to assess and compare the effects of a commercially available program for weight loss that includes Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) and a standard LC diet on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver fat content using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As a secondary aim, we evaluated the effect of both interventions on liver stiffness measurements.  ",04550fc2-927d-4e23-8dd6-5016886f3606

Patients were randomized and treated either with an LC or a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) and received orientation and encouragement to physical activity equally for both groups. visceral adipose tissue (VAT), liver fat fraction, and liver stiffness were measured at baseline and after 2 months of treatment using magnetic resonance imaging. Paired t-tests were used for comparison of continuous variables between visits and unpaired test between groups. Categorical variables were compared using the χ2-test. Pearson correlation was used to assess the association between visceral adipose tissue (VAT), anthropometric measures, and hepatic fat fraction.

All study participants underwent periodic clinical assessment by a specialized endocrinologist through the course of the study. Aiming for congruency between both groups, patients were maintained under the correspondent weight-loss regimens for the same period of time (2 months) when the follow-up Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. Orientations on lifestyle changes, adequate dietary habits, and physical activity were provided by expert support staff comprising dietitians and physical trainers to both groups at the initial visit.  Low-Calorie Diet The standard LC diet was an equilibrated diet that had a caloric value 15% below the total metabolic expenditure of each individual.",1d1e67a6-8fd1-4569-b070-fa5fb3dcff93

The calories provided to this group ranged between 1,400 and 1,800 kcal/day. The ratio of macronutrients provided was 45–55% carbohydrates, 15–25% proteins, and 25–35% fat in addition to a recommended intake of 20–40 g/day of fiber in the form of vegetables and fruits.  Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet The Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) group followed a diet according to the first stage of a commercial weight loss program (Pronokal® method) (24) based on a high biological value protein preparation.",b6c77880-ba00-4ddb-a2d7-4a18dd39a3a7

The amount of high-biological-value proteins ranged between 0.8 and 1.2 g per each kilogram of ideal body weight, to ensure meeting the minimal body requirements and to prevent the loss of lean mass (16).2 Throughout the ketogenic phase, supplements of vitamins and minerals were provided in accordance to international recommendations (Supplementary Materials).

10,methods6," Abdominal Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at baseline and at 2 months' follow-up treatment using an abbreviated protocol (25) for the specific purpose of this study. Patients were imaged in a 1.5-T MR scanner (GE 450 W; GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) in the supine position without the use of intravenous contrast administration. All image analysis was performed by a fellowship-trained abdominal radiologist with 10 years of experience who was blinded to patients' clinical information and randomization.  Visceral Adipose Tissue Area Manual visceral adipose tissue (VAT) segmentation was performed on water images obtained with an Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) chemical-shift sequence to ensure maximal contrast between fat and non-fatty tissues. The visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area in the axial slice at the level of the third/fourth lumbar intervertebral disk (L3–L4) was measured.",dcee49bb-e0dd-45b0-ba45-971b786cb41e

Liver Proton Density Fat Fraction Measurements To estimate liver fat content, measurements of liver proton density fat fraction (proton density fat fraction (PDFF)) were performed using a multigradient-echo confounder-corrected chemical shift–encoded sequence (IDEAL-IQ®). Five-square-centimeter electronic regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn over the right liver lobe on the Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-proton density fat fraction (PDFF) parametric maps, avoiding major vessels, the gallbladder fossa, or focal lesions. proton density fat fraction (PDFF) is expressed in percentile as a non-invasive biomarker of liver steatosis (19).

Liver Stiffness A commercially available standard liver two-dimensional gradient-echo MR elastography (MR elastography (MRE)) sequence (MR-Touch® General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was used to acquire stiffness maps at the midportion of the liver, in correspondence to the proton density fat fraction (PDFF) sections. MR elastography (MRE) imaging parameters are described elsewhere (25). ROIs were used to estimate mean liver stiffness values over the right liver lobe in correspondence to the proton density fat fraction (PDFF) measurements. Stiffness values are expressed in mean kilopascals (kPa). Liver stiffness values below 2.8 kPa were considered as absence of fibrosis, values between 2.8 and 4.1 kPa indicative of mild fibrosis, and higher than 4.15 kPa considered a sign of advanced fibrosis (22, 27, 28).",3f9a890c-61a5-4629-969b-658a227452b2

For this exploratory pilot study to prove a concept, we did not perform a power analysis to estimate sample sizes. Study data distribution was assessed for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and study results reported as means and standard deviations (SDs). All comparisons from baseline to 2 months of follow-up have been made on “completers.” For comparison of the variables [overall weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area, hepatic fat fraction, and liver stiffness], a Student t-test was used for the continuous variables using an unpaired test for the comparison between groups and a paired test for the comparison between visits.

21,discussion0,"This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the effects of a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver fat fraction measured by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to a standard LC diet. Secondarily, we performed a longitudinal assessment of liver stiffness, a surrogate of inflammation and fibrosis in both groups. Not only did we find expected higher weight loss and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) reductions in patients undergoing the program with Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) than in patients undergoing an LC diet, but we also found a significantly higher decrease in liver fat content in the former population. No patient showed changes in liver stiffness during the interventions. Our results corroborate that the therapeutic implementation of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)s can result in a faster mobilization of liver fat and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) than current standard weight-loss regimens.",b0ecc90c-f8d3-4d0d-9684-02507647e037
22,discussion1,"  Our cohort comprised adult individuals from the general population undergoing weight loss treatment for clinical care. Not all patients had liver steatosis, with only 67.4% showing a proton density fat fraction (PDFF) >5.4% at baseline, mirroring the prevalence of liver steatosis in populations with obesity (29). In our study, greater visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) reductions were seen in patients treated with a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) in comparison to patients undergoing an LC diet. At 2 months, only in the LC group a high correlation between visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) persisted, whereas this correlation was lost in the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) group because of the higher reduction in proton density fat fraction (PDFF) relative to visceral adipose tissue (VAT).",5bc8bf9d-3b03-40cd-80a6-fa328c76fa21
23,discussion2," This particular finding contributes to confirm the hypothesis that the mobilization of liver fat occurs faster than in other compartments in patients undergoing Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) interventions (13, 17). Although one could argue that these results relate to the inequality in calorie intake between Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) and conventional LC diets, the differences regarding the correlation between visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) at baseline and at 2 months between groups may indicate differently. Studies have shown that the fast reduction in liver fat is probably more related to the ketogenic state than to overall calorie restriction (17), and insulin resistance has been suggested as a key mechanism in this process (30). In a prior study, Luukkonen et al.",a5a01cba-dc45-4fd9-b87a-e7a9a9ce0652
24,discussion3," (17) have described a high rate of liver triglycerides hydrolysis during the increased hepatic production of ketones, as serum insulin concentrations, endogenous glucose production, and hepatic insulin resistance decrease in patients undergoing Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD). In our study, however, this relationship was not confirmed as differences in reduction of Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) between both groups failed to reach statistical differences. It is likely that the lack of statistical significance in our study is related to the small sample size, however conceivable that the reduction in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver fat fraction in such a short term in patients undergoing Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) is also related to additional metabolic changes.",7cf31f74-dcb1-487c-a056-4ef88584fb2c
25,discussion4," Most studies to date examining the relationship between non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance are cross-sectional in design, have small sample sizes, or use rat models (17, 31–38), and hence, future longitudinal clinical studies with larger cohorts should be performed to validate the role of insulin resistance in the reversal of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) at short and long terms.  To date, the association between weight loss and improvements in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as subject of research reveals no single intervention beyond weight loss to promote effective improvements in the outcomes of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients (39, 40).",a5fba375-6df6-4f52-b546-baa04e53dab7
26,discussion5," In 2015, a prospective uncontrolled study of 293 patients undergoing calorie restriction and lifestyle changes for 52 weeks, with paired liver biopsies, found that a relative loss of 7–10% body weight improved non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score in 88–100% of patients and resolved steatohepatitis in 84–90% of patients (41). Accordingly, clinical practice guidelines recommend a weight loss of at least 7% aiming to achieve histologic improvement in steatohepatitis and necroinflammation (42). Regrettably, long-term shift in dietary and lifestyle behavior is challenging, with only one in five patients undergoing conventional lifestyle intervention successfully achieving weight loss goals, reflecting the low adherence and reduced efficacy of most interventions (43).",18f07bce-6119-4c2a-a292-d53825865c99
27,discussion6," Alternatively, bariatric surgery has shown to be effective in reducing visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver fat fraction, however, at the cost of reducing lean mass and at higher rates of complications, which make this approach unsuitable for wide clinical application (13–15). As shown in our and other studies, Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) may be a safe and effective short-term approach to achieve a rapid reduction in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver fat content, before patients are transitioned to the next steps of weight loss and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) treatment, the latter focusing on lifestyle modifications and long-term maintenance (17, 44, 45). Additionally, the short-term positive results seen with Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) may act as an ally to increase adherence to treatment.",cd095227-2a45-407e-a3b7-273a3ca31055
28,discussion7," In the clinical setting, an unquestionable positive response to treatment perceived in short periods of time often acts as a spur to increase adherence even in the more resistant patients (46, 47).  Although other studies have investigated Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) as an effective approach for reversing non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with obesity, the sparsity of studies with accurate measurements of liver outcomes has been highlighted by experts as a major limitation to confirm this hypothesis (44). Hence, to further contribute to the understanding of this process, we designed a study using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the measurements of outcomes, which has been proven the most reliable and accurate non-invasive method for fat quantification (19, 21, 48). Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)s represent a nutritional intervention that mimics fasting through a marked restriction of daily carbohydrate intake (44).",f7ee431b-7bfe-4aab-8423-0e7b2d23d631
29,discussion8," Accordingly, the commercially available weight loss program used in our study (Pronokal® Method) is a multidisciplinary method that uses a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) relying on <50 g of carbohydrates per day and high-biological-value proteins, the latter intended to prevent the loss of lean mass (16), in addition to physical activity and individual supportive counseling. This method has been shown to result in effective weight loss, with low risks and high adherence (24). Although concerns of liver-related complications associated with rapid weight loss have been mentioned in the literature (46), neither alterations in markers of liver function nor changes in liver stiffness were observed in our study.  None of the groups in our study showed signs of advanced liver fibrosis based on MR elastrography results. Although our sample size was small, this should be related to the low prevalence of liver fibrosis in the general population.",99214429-2d42-44ed-b62a-ed99d75fa165
30,discussion9," Also, similar to others (17), there were no significant changes in liver stiffness during treatment. Of note, at baseline, two patients in the LC group and one in the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) group had liver stiffness values at the upper limit for absence of fibrosis considered in this study (2.8 kPa). Although stiffness values between 2.5 and 2.8 kPa have been proposed as potential indicator of liver inflammation (22, 27, 28), these studies were performed in different populations, and therefore, results cannot be directly translated to our cohort. Further studies should be performed to elucidate the clinical relevance of these values in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and obesity.  Some limitations of our study should be listed.",d344d0aa-7964-4dcd-afcd-cb7087486fa8
31,discussion10," First, while both groups were formed by individuals undergoing weight-loss treatment for clinical care, our sample size is small and with a predominance of non-diabetic female patients, which should warrant caution when extrapolating our results to other populations. Further studies with larger sample sizes should be encouraged to validate our results. Second, although volumetric Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods could have been used to quantify visceral adipose tissue (VAT), the limited availability and high costs and complexity associated with these techniques restrict their application in clinical practice (49). Finally, we did not assess blood ketone levels, which could have provided insights into the mechanisms underlying the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)-mediated effects on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver fat reduction.",25c33c1c-c087-4c21-bf9c-dfef1757e39c
32,discussion11,"  In conclusion, patients undergoing a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) program achieved superior weight loss, with significant visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver fat fraction reductions when compared to a standard LC diet. These results corroborate other studies indicating that the rapid mobilization of liver fat demonstrated with Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) could serve as an effective short-term alternative for the treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A dietary plan with very low caloric and very low carbohydrate content as part of a multidisciplinary approach to lose weight could be the first step to positively reset the lipid metabolism in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) due to obesity, coupled with subsequent long-term maintenance period, according to the recommendations in Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) interventions.",3ea6d545-995b-43b2-8903-4f7ed1031183
