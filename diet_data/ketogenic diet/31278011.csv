0,methods0,"Cell culture (for sirtuin analysis and MCTr): Hippocampal neurons from an immortalized murine cell line, HT22, were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM)) (Thermo Scientific, USA) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Biowest SAS, France) and 1% (v/v) Penicillin/Streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). T25 sterile flasks (Sarstedt AG, Germany) were used to culture the cells. The cells were grown under 37 °C and 5% CO2. In the first phase of the study, HT22 neurons were cultured under two different glucose concentrations, standard (4.5 g/L) and low glucose (1 g/L). A quantity of 4.5 g/dL (450 mg/dL) of glucose seems high compared to human conditions but is the standard concentration for incubating HT22 cells. Concentrations lower than 1g/L (100 mg/dL) of glucose are not tolerated by HT22 neurons, proliferation is poor, as observed in pilot experiments.",1d594196-69ce-4f43-ac38-f0c27eb9a53a
1,methods1," The low glucose cultures were established to simulate a “ketogenic” environment (low carb) for the cells. In the second phase of the study, cells were divided into either control (untreated) or KD-treated groups. Both the control and the KD-treated cells were cultured under low (1 g/L) glucose.  Two KD metabolites were used to treat the HT22 cells: 5 mM ßHB (beta–hydroxybutyrate), the predominant ketone body and 250 µM C10 (decanoic acid), a medium-chain fatty acid. This concentration of C10 is found in CSF of mice undergoing KD-treatment while blood concentrations (410 µM) are considerably higher [53]. Five millimoles ßHB is the typical therapeutic concentration in plasma reached in human patients under KD. In rats, a close positive correlation between blood- and CSF- concentrations of ßHB has been observed [54]. Ketonemia has been shown to increase the uptake of ketones by the brain [55].",08c4b108-421c-4f51-ab3f-a5f23c6319a5
2,methods2," A recent review on KD stated, that 5 mM of ßHB is a clinically meaningful concentration which is typically used for experimentation regarding KD [13]. Cells were incubated with decanoic acid or ßHB for 1 week with medium changes every other day.  Cells were lysed using Laemmli buffer for Western blot analysis, HEPES buffer for sirtuin enzyme activity and RLT buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for RNA isolation.  Sirtuin enzyme activity: Enzyme activities of sirtuins (SIRT) 1-3 were determined using the fluorescence-based enzyme activity kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Lausen, Switzerland), with sirtuins (SIRT)1 (FLUOR DE LYS® sirtuins (SIRT)1 Substrate) (Enzo Life Sciences, Lausen, Switzerland) and sirtuins (SIRT)2 and 3 (FLUOR DE LYS® sirtuins (SIRT)2 Substrate) (Enzo Life Sciences, Lausen, Switzerland) as specific substrates.

A full-area 96 well plate was used, and the colorimetric reaction was detected.  Protein expression: Equal number of cells (5000 cells/µL) were lysed using Laemmli buffer post harvesting. Semi-dry Western blotting technique was used to determine protein expression of sirtuins. SDS–PAGE gels (10% separating gel and 4% collecting gel) were used for electrophoresis and a nitrocellulose membrane was used for the transfer. A total of 10 µL of each probe was loaded onto the gel after heating at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm.",0e68e627-4120-4e01-8363-c6c9d765cc48

Beta-Actin was used to normalize the protein expression of sirtuins in the respective probes. Relative protein expression was determined by normalizing with the control (untreated) probe. Secondary anti-rabbit and anti-goat antibodies were purchased from Li-cor Biosciences, USA. Intercept™ blocking buffer (TBS) from Li-Cor Biosciences was used to dilute all antibodies. The Odyssey FC system (Li-cor biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) was used for detection of bands.  Gene expression: RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed using the RNeasy mini kit and Omniscript RT kit, respectively, from Qiagen, Germany.",71496936-d2c2-4ee4-a430-bc9e6010ac35
5,methods5," sirtuins (SIRT) 1-4 and MCTrs 1 and 2 gene expression was analyzed using a SYBR green-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) on a 7900HT fast Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system and analyzed using SDS 2.4 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA). Murine primers for sirtuins (SIRT) 1–4, MCTr 1, MCTr 2 and housekeeper genes (B2M, HPRT1 and ACT-B) were used for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (refer to Table S1 (Supplementary Material). Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) and beta-actin (ACT-B) were used as internal controls and relative sirtuin gene expression was calculated based on a normalization method using the three internal controls [56].

KG, Berlin, Germany) as described before for other cell types [57,58].  Spectrophotometric analysis of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (MRC) complexes and CS: Capacities (maximal enzymatic activities under substrate saturation in vitro) of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (MRC) complexes and Citrate Synthase (CS) were determined spectrophotometrically. Specific substances were used as inhibitors to measure activities of different complexes: rotenone (complex I + III), antimycin (complex II + III) and oligomycin (complex V).",6c39588c-9ec7-4590-b8b8-0230249a8f86
7,methods7," Spectrophotometric measurement was performed according to the established methods for complex I + III [59], complex II + III [60], complex V [61,62] and citrate synthase [63] at 37 °C. Precipitation of protein for quantification was done using trichloroacetic acid (trichloroacetic acid (TCA)) [64] and subsequently, the protein concentration was measured using a Bicinchoninic assay (BCA) assay as described above.  Statistical analysis: All results are shown as mean + SD. The unpaired t-test (or Mann–Whitney test for non-parametric data) was used to determine the statistical significance of all the results. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered as significant. A minimum of 3 independent samples were used for each experiment, measurements were carried out in duplicate.

8,methods8," Measurement of Sirtuins under Standard and Low Glucose Concentrations The standard glucose concentration in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) used to culture HT22 neuronal cells is 4.5 g/L (25 mmol/L). To simulate a “ketogenic environment”, the glucose concentration was reduced to 1 g/L (5.6 mmol/L) in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), the minimal concentration tolerated by the cells in terms of proliferation. The protein and gene expression were normalized to the low glucose (1 g/L) group. No statistically significant differences were noted between the two groups in enzyme activity (Figure 1A–C), relative protein expression (Figure 1D–F) and gene expression (Figure 1J–L) of sirtuins.  3.2.

9,methods9," Sirtuin Enzyme Activity, Protein Expression and Gene Expression Both the untreated (control) and treated (with 5mM ßHB) groups of HT22 neurons were cultured under low (1 g/L) glucose in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM). ßHB incubation significantly induced sirtuins (SIRT)1 enzyme activity (Figure 2A) as well as protein expression (Figure 2D) in comparison with the control. Similarly, enzyme activity of sirtuins (SIRT)3 (Figure 2C) was also significantly increased on treatment with ßHB. The enzyme activities of sirtuins (SIRT)1 and sirtuins (SIRT)3 were increased ~2 fold and ~1.5 fold, respectively, as compared to controls. However, no significant change was seen in the protein expressions of sirtuins (SIRT)2 (Figure 2E) and sirtuins (SIRT)3 (Figure 2F), while protein expression of sirtuins (SIRT)1 was significantly increased (Figure 2D). sirtuins (SIRT)4 protein expression (Figure 2M), although not statistically significant, was ~1.",e0a3f62d-1b58-4d4a-96d8-6ce2473f4c5f
10,methods10,"4 fold higher in the ßHB-treated group as compared to the control. The consistent elevation in enzyme activities of sirtuins (SIRT) 1–3, but no significant alterations at protein (except for sirtuins (SIRT)1) and gene expression levels suggest a post-translational modification under 5 mM ßHB treatment.  3.2.2. Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain (mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (MRC)) Complexes and Citrate Synthase (CS) Enzyme activities of complex I+III, complex II+III, complex IV, complex V (ATP synthase) and the mitochondrial marker enzyme, citrate synthase (CS) were measured in control (untreated) and 5 mM ßHB-treated HT22 cells. Activities of complexes were normalized to CS as a mitochondrial marker. Incubation of HT22 neurons with 5 mM ßHB resulted in an upregulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Enzyme activity of Complex I + III (Figure 3A) was significantly increased in the treatment group. Increases in the enzyme activities of Complex II + III (p = 0.",e3e8ca46-f38a-48a7-a357-789672b7103e
11,methods11,"0558) (Figure 3B) and Complex V (p = 0.0667) (Figure 3G) were non-significant. This suggests an overall induction of the respiratory chain complexes. Enzyme activity of citrate synthase (Figure 3I) was also significantly elevated in the ßHB-treated cells. CS has been described as a marker for mitochondrial content and an induction in its activity could point towards increased mitochondrial biogenesis.  3.3. Incubation with the Medium Chain Fatty Acid Decanoic Acid (C10) 3.3.1. Sirtuin Enzyme Activity, Protein Expression and Gene Expression Only sirtuins (SIRT)1 enzyme activity (Figure 4A) was significantly elevated on C10 incubation, as compared to the untreated cells. sirtuins (SIRT)3 enzyme activity (Figure 4C) showed a near-significant increase (p = 0.0581) in cells incubated under C10. Relative protein and gene expressions of sirtuins (SIRT)3 were significantly higher in C10-incubated cells (Figure 4F,L). Albeit not significantly, sirtuins (SIRT)4 was ~1.",7b1d1b52-c48e-46a9-a793-74024dab505a
12,methods12,"5 fold higher in the C10-incubated cells as compared to the control group (Figure 4M). A similar trend was also noted in the gene expression of sirtuins (SIRT)3 (Figure 4L). Thus, decanoic acid mainly led to elevated sirtuins (SIRT)1 enzyme capacity without a significant change in its protein or gene expression, once again suggesting a post-translational modification.  3.3.2. Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain (mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (MRC)) Complexes and Citrate Synthase (CS) Enzymatic capacities of complexes I–V as well as capacities normalized to the citrate synthase are reported. Decanoic acid (C10) incubation significantly increased the enzyme capacities of complex I + III (Figure 5A) and complex IV (Figure 5C). The activity of complex II + III (Figure 5B) showed a slight increase in the treatment group; however, this change was not significant.",432d1172-5ce9-47df-bf9e-f5556479aef8
13,methods13," Interestingly, the enzymatic activities of ATP synthase (complex V) (Figure 5G) and citrate synthase (CS) (Figure 5I) remained unchanged in the C10-treated group. The ratios of maximal activity of the respiratory chain enzymes to that of CS demonstrate the enzyme activity of the respective complex in a given amount of mitochondria. It is noteworthy that the ratios of complexes I + III (Figure 5D) and complex IV (Figure 5F) normalized to CS in the C10-treated group were significantly higher than in the control group. This observation points towards a more efficient functioning of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in the C10 treated HT22 cells rather than an increase of mitochondrial mass.  3.4. Monocarboxylate Transporters (MCTr) 1 and 2 Gene expressions of MCTr 1 and MCTr 2 were determined in HT22 cells incubated with 5 mM ßHB and 250 µM C10.",e80b292f-1c18-4ba8-82f2-b924203780d7
14,methods14," Significant upregulation of MCTr 1 in cells incubated with 250 µM C10 (Figure 6C) and MCTr 2 in cells incubated with 5 mM ßHB (Figure 6B) was observed. Non–significant upregulations of MCTr 1 in ßHB-treated cells (Figure 6A) and MCTr 2 in C10-treated cells (Figure 6D) were seen.  4. Discussion Clinically, KD has been successfully used as a therapeutic option in epilepsy [1,2], other neurological disorders [5,9,65], inborn errors of metabolism [66] as well as in cancer [10]; however, the mechanism underlying these clinical benefits is still unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy [67,68], neurodegenerative disorders [69,70], inborn errors of metabolism [58,71,72] and cancer [73]. Upregulation of the mitochondrial function/mitochondrial biogenesis has been suggested as a possible mechanism of action of KD [11,16,74].",02dcfb1b-f8b0-478b-94b0-dbcd79df311c
15,methods15,"  Role of sirtuins (SIRT)3: Sirtuins regulate mitochondrial metabolism as well as other biochemical and physiological pathways. About 65% of the mitochondrial proteins are acylated [75], offering a huge potential for sirtuins acting as NAD+-dependent deacylase enzymes [20], thus regulating mitochondrial function. Indeed, sirtuins (SIRT)3 has been shown to deacetylate a wide variety of mitochondrial targets [34,76,77]. sirtuins (SIRT)3 was found to regulate the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. A recent study described the role of sirtuins (SIRT)3 in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics in the context of KD treatment [17]. Long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (Long chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD)) was shown to be deacetylated and activated by sirtuins (SIRT)3 in mice [26]. This shows that the fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria is regulated by sirtuins (SIRT)3, an important aspect with respect to high-fat KD.",34bf0c89-85a2-42db-9273-28e63336305b
16,methods16," In a recent in vivo- study, we have shown that exercise as a metabolic stressor leads to an up-regulation of sirtuins in humans [78]. Our results show an induction in enzyme activity of sirtuins (SIRT)3 on incubation with 5 mM ßHB, the predominant ketone body. Incubation with decanoic acid showed an upregulation of sirtuins (SIRT)3 protein and gene expression, which may be an additional mechanism increasing sirtuins (SIRT)3 function in KD. NAD is increased under KD [79], which could additionally activate sirtuins (SIRT)3 (and other sirtuins). sirtuins (SIRT)3 function may be modulated by deacetylation or phosphorylation [80]; however, the mechanism of such a post-translational modification (post translational modification (PTM)) in the context of KD is unclear.  Role of sirtuins (SIRT)1: sirtuins (SIRT)1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus and has a strong deacetylase activity [20].",83f91a77-c94b-4125-81c4-3a38c96f8e83
17,methods17," Interestingly, it has also been suggested that sirtuins (SIRT)1 may be found in the mitochondria as well; however, this is not well studied [39]. It has been shown that sirtuins (SIRT)1, along with PGC-1α, regulates mitochondrial biogenesis [21,81]. Furthermore, sirtuins (SIRT)1 has also been shown to regulate antioxidant mechanisms via the transcription factors PGC-1α and FOXO3a [22]. Studies have also reported that sirtuins (SIRT)1 plays an important role in ROS detoxification via regulation of enzymes such as SOD2 and catalase [23]. Mitochondria are an important site for generation of ROS [82], thus making regulatory mechanisms of ROS detoxification by sirtuins (SIRT)1 important in this context. Both ßHB and C10 treatment induced sirtuins (SIRT)1 enzyme capacity in HT22 cells as compared to untreated cells. In response to incubation with 5 mM ßHB, sirtuins (SIRT)1 protein expression was also increased.",89136566-a08f-4141-8779-39e51a287680
18,methods18," Enzyme capacity of citrate synthase as a marker for mitochondrial mass, was also significantly higher in the ßHB-treated HT22 cells indicating an induction of mitochondrial biogenesis. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that improvement in mitochondrial function, via sirtuins (SIRT)1, could be one of the potential mechanisms underlying the beneficial impact of ketogenic diet. Several different mechanisms of post translational modification (PTM)s of sirtuins (SIRT)1 have been described, including, but not limited to, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and methylation [80,83]. A new post translational modification (PTM) in the presence of high concentrations of the ketone body–ßHB has been described called lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation [84]. Although this post translational modification (PTM) has not been directly described in the context of sirtuins, it may provide valuable insights into the function of sirtuins in mediating the therapeutic effect of KD.",c441ab70-4ae0-4a03-b9e0-5c4830cddec2
19,methods19,"  Upregulation of energy metabolism: Treatment of HT22 cells with both, ßHB and C10 resulted in an upregulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The effect of C10 on enzymatic capacities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (MRC) complexes in our study was prominent—an induction in not only the maximal activities of complex I + III and complex IV, but also their ratios normalized to the CS activity, indicating a more efficient function of the mitochondria, rather than an increase in mitochondrial mass. Our findings regarding upregulation of energy metabolism by C10, are in line with findings in previous studies, in the SH-SY5Y neuronal cell line as well as fibroblasts from patients with mitochondrial disorders [7,15]. However, the enzyme activity of CS was unchanged with 250 µM C10. On the other hand, treatment of HT22 cells with 5 mM ßHB induced activity of CS—suggesting a probable increase in mitochondrial quantity and function.",0f3c13ab-9a5f-4020-a3ed-946bee915c17
20,methods20,"  As described earlier, sirtuins (SIRT)3 has been shown to regulate the function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (MRC). This is in line with our present study, where ßHB incubation of HT22 neurons significantly upregulated sirtuins (SIRT)3 and respiratory chain enzyme activities. This can result in an overall upregulation of the respiratory chain. Mitochondrial biogenesis is an important potential mechanism of action of KD [16]. A recent article has described the role of sirtuins (SIRT)3 in improving mitochondrial function and biogenesis on KD treatment [17]. These observations are similar to our analysis of sirtuins and energy metabolism on KD treatment in neuronal cells in vitro.  Upregulation of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTr): Levels of ßHB, the predominant ketone body, are significantly elevated during KD treatment and ßHB is taken up by the brain as an alternative energy substrate [12,85].",313e079e-a963-43d2-adbd-972fc67e50ff
21,methods21," It is well established that MCTr 1 and 2 both facilitate transport of monocarboxylates such as ßHB in various tissues, including neurons [47,48,49]. Incubation of HT22 neurons with 5 mM ßHB resulted in significant upregulation of MCTr 2–indicating a possible role of the MCTr 2 in transporting ßHB present in the culture medium into the neurons. It has been shown that C10 is transported into the brain from systemic circulation; however, the mechanism behind this process in not known [53,65]. Our results demonstrate significant upregulation of gene expression of MCTr 1 in HT22 neurons incubated with 250 µM C10.  Findings of our study are summarized in Figure 7.  Clear limitations of our study are the in vitro model used which may not reflect in vivo conditions and the incubation with exogenous metabolites.",cd1a0602-71a8-4740-8420-188b733ae798
22,methods22," Concentrations of ßHB vary in plasma and CSF under KD treatment, we used 5 mM, however there are individual differences in response to ßHB,-some patients even respond to lower concentrations. Further studies will be performed using lower serial concentrations (0.5 mM–2.5 mM) of ßHB to examine whether sirtuins and mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (MRC) complexes are differently altered under incubation with different ßHB concentrations. Under in vivo conditions, KD leads to an increase of both ßHB and decanoic acid which may have a synergistic effect.  5. Conclusions The findings from our study indicate that two metabolites accumulating under ketogenic diet treatment, namely beta-hydroxybutyrate, the predominant ketone body, and decanoic acid—an important medium-chain fatty acid, induce the enzymatic activities of sirtuins and upregulate the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes in murine hippocampal neurons.",b361fab7-3768-41a3-bfe0-727b4ab5f453
23,methods23," Sirtuin up-regulation may result in the activation of respiratory chain enzymes. These observations suggest that sirtuins may play an important role in the mechanism of action of ketogenic diet, possibly via upregulated energy metabolism. However, further in vivo experimentation is needed to confirm this mechanism. In particular, the effect of inhibitors and activators of sirtuins on respiratory chain complexes shall be studied in future experiments. ",90657434-a3b0-48ac-b970-209840b73c31
