0,discussion0," There has been a growing association between PP, diet changes, and ketosis. This condition was first described in Japan, and was thought to be limited to the Japanese population [5]. Since then, more cases have been reported in the rest of the world [3,4]. Despite an unknown mechanism of pathophysiology, there have been reports of the occurrence of PP during prolonged fasting, strict diet restrictions, during the period of ketosis following a ketogenic diet, and following bariatric surgery [6,7]. Our patient presents as a unique case because, to our knowledge, this condition has only been reported in a small number of cases in the Western world. Most of the cases reported are either due to ketogenic diet or due to gastric surgeries alone. This case shows the occurrence of PP following both of these conditions in the same individual, which could be suggestive of a stronger relationship between PP and the metabolic state of the body.",296a12a7-626b-43eb-a429-a06bea61e1c5
1,discussion1,"  Finally, treatment for this case showed its effectiveness as minocycline has been shown to help with PP through its anti-inflammatory mechanism [2,8]. The main contributor, however, that eliminated the rash completely was the incorporation of carbs in her diet over a long period of time, which is what has also been observed in some published reports [9]. This case should serve to raise awareness about this condition as it could be going under-diagnosed due to variable histopathology and overlap with other dermatoses. In patients with poor response to topical corticosteroids, this entity should be entertained in the differential diagnosis. With the constant increase in rates of bariatric surgeries, it is important to watch out for such associations especially during the post-operative period where the patient is more likely to enter ketosis [10].",13d5c453-f4d5-4188-89c8-844adab46c4c
2,discussion2,"  Conclusions  This case outlines the presentation of a 25-year-old female who presented with a pruritic rash in the intermammary cleft following an attempt at the ketogenic diet as well as a gastric sleeve surgery. This rash presentation was identified to be prurigo pigmentosa, a rare condition that we have yet to understand the etiology of. However, there seems to be a growing association between PP and the metabolic state of the body, and this case presents further evidence to strengthen this link. The diagnosis of PP should be considered in patients with poor response to topical corticosteroids as well as patients who develop rashes after bariatric surgeries or after starting a keto diet.
