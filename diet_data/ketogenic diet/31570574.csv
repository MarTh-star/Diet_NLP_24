0,introduction0," Intragastric balloons have been used for weight loss (WL) in the last two decades, but the need for hospital recovery, upper GI endoscopy, and anesthesia is major limitations for this technique. The Elipse™ intragastric balloon (Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB)) is a new swallowable balloon that has no such limitations and has been proven to be safe, effective in achieving weight loss is also, and well tolerated by patients [1–6].  After Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB) placement, a standard low-calorie diet (low calorie diet (LCD)) program, based on a daily intake of about 1000–1200 kcal/day, is generally prescribed [6]. The combination of the restrictive effect of Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB) and diet accounts for a significant loss of fatty free mass (fat free mass (FFM)). Indeed, maintaining adequate fat free mass (FFM) is an important consideration when making WL because muscles play a central role in whole-body protein metabolism [7].",92bfeb6e-9b11-4aa6-b7be-b2700cb4d170
1,introduction1," Additionally, a significant decrease in fat free mass (FFM) may negatively affect the resting metabolic rate (resting metabolic rate (RMR)) [8–11], slow the rate of WL, and predispose to weight regain [12]. Moreover, no studies have been conducted so far on the amount of WL attributed to the loss of fat mass (FM) and fat free mass (FFM) in the setting of Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB) treatment.  A low-calorie ketogenic diet (low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD)) has been proven to be safe and effective for WL [13–17], especially in reducing FM while preserving fat free mass (FFM) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) [18–20].  Therefore, we designed a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) and a standard low calorie diet (LCD) after Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB) on WL, FM, fat free mass (FFM), and resting metabolic rate (RMR).

2,background0," The Elipse™ intragastric balloon (Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB)) is a new swallowable balloon for weight loss (WL). Preserving metabolically active fat-free mass (fat free mass (FFM)) and resting metabolic rate (resting metabolic rate (RMR)) during WL are crucial to maximize fat mass (FM) loss. After Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB) placement, a standard low-calorie diet (low calorie diet (LCD)) is generally prescribed. A low-calorie ketogenic diet (low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD)) has proven to be safe and effective in reducing FM while preserving fat free mass (FFM) and resting metabolic rate (RMR).  Objective  To prospectively compare the effects on WL, FM, fat free mass (FFM), and resting metabolic rate (RMR) in two groups of patients who were randomized to two different diets: low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) and a standard low calorie diet (LCD) after Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB) placement. ",e9b0e1bf-4c2e-47b5-b9f9-5799f5fc2753
3,methods0," WL, FM, fat free mass (FFM), and resting metabolic rate (RMR) were measured before Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB) and at 4 months in 48 patients who received either a low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) (n = 24) or a standard low calorie diet (LCD) (n = 24). Compliance in following the prescribed diet was determined with food frequency questionnaires in all patients. The impact of low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) and low calorie diet (LCD) on renal function was also evaluated.   The Elipse™ Intragastric Balloon System  The Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB) (Allurion Technologies, Natick, MA, USA) is a swallowed, self-emptying, and excreted gastric balloon for WL [21]. It is folded into a vegetarian capsule and attached to a thin catheter. The capsule is easily swollen with a glass of water. However, in case swallowing is problematic, a stylet can be fed through the catheter to stiffen it, allowing the physician to gently push the capsule during swallowing.",e96719f9-1977-4e34-8542-5f63fbe6bedf
4,methods1," The Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB) contains a small radiopaque ring that can be used to confirm its correct position inside the stomach through an abdominal X-ray [21]. Once the capsule is in the stomach, the balloon is filled with 550 mL of liquid consisting distilled water with potassium sorbate preservative, and then the catheter is removed, and a second X-ray is performed to confirm the balloon is filled and that the placement is complete [21]. After approximately 4 months, a time-activated release valve opens, allowing the balloon to empty and pass naturally through the digestive system to be excreted and thus ideally does not require any endoscopic procedure [22].",92a90911-95d1-4140-a823-751efec0bc65

Furthermore, after the 4-month low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD), patients had significantly higher blood ketone levels compared to baseline (p < 0.001) whereas in low calorie diet (LCD) group only a not significant trace of blood ketones was found compared to baseline (p = 0.527) (Table 2).",240b1c13-582b-4ce1-a216-6de7c603af41

Values for energy intake (expressed in kcal/day) and all macronutrients reported during the 72-h recalls and the three-day estimated records were strictly similar to those of the post-Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB) placement, indicating a high patient’s compliance of following the prescribed diets in both group studies (Table 4).Table 4 Macronutrients daily intake from the 3-day estimated food record and the 72-h recall of the participants consuming a low-calorie ketogenic diet (low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD)) or a low-calorie diet (low calorie diet (LCD)). p < 0.",425784f6-dcca-4cca-a9ce-01af063c168f
23,discussion0," Based on our findings, despite the small sample size, this study indicates that low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) is associated with an increased FM loss while reducing the fat free mass (FFM) loss and the resting metabolic rate (RMR), without interfering with renal function after Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB). These findings are in accordance with other studies who confirmed that the ketogenic diet is safe and highly effective in terms of BW reduction without inducing a significant fat free mass (FFM) loss [18, 34].  Interestingly, herein, we found that patients who followed the low calorie diet (LCD) had a greater total body weight loss, at 4 months after Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB), than patients who followed the low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD). Our findings indicate that the higher weight loss in the low calorie diet (LCD) group was mainly due to fat free mass (FFM) loss and less FM than the experimental group.",81abf4d8-c82e-42af-b263-b5c0adbb7a9b
24,discussion1," The net result of the body composition changes is a greater total body weight decrease in the low calorie diet (LCD) group. Our results indicate that the process of body weight loss is more physiologic in the experimental group that loses less fat free mass (FFM) than the control group. Among the bioimpedance parameters measured with bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA), the phase angle (defined as the ratio of resistance (intracellular and extracellular resistance) to reactance (cell membrane-specific resistance) expressed as an angle) is a clinically important parameter used for nutritional assessment and for assessment of the risk of various disease [35]. Interestingly, as shown in Table 3, herein, we found that patients who followed the low calorie diet (LCD) had a lower phase angle, at 4 months after Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB) placement, than patients who followed the low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD).",9bd178fb-1342-49a1-8b9d-d7e781cf88f0
25,discussion2," In our opinion, this finding is clinically relevant considering that the phase angle represents both the amount and quality of soft tissue, with a high phase angle reflecting higher cellularity, better cell heath and better nutritional status [35].  Furthermore, the sustained weight and FM loss induced by low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) did not induce any significant reduction in resting metabolic rate (RMR), probably due to the preservation of fat free mass (FFM). In particular, we show that in the low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) group, the resting metabolic rate (RMR) was preserved and remained within the expected limits for the variation in fat free mass (FFM). Interestingly, the metabolic adaptation phenomenon called “adaptative thermogenesis,” defined as a decrease in resting metabolic rate (RMR) out of proportion to the decrease in body mass was not activated in concomitance with the low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) [20, 36, 37].",be9b0a61-6e47-491c-a565-82118229fbd4
26,discussion3," On the contrary, patients in the low calorie diet (LCD) group in addition to the significant weight and FM loss showed a significant decrease in both fat free mass (FFM) and resting metabolic rate (RMR).  resting metabolic rate (RMR) is recognized as the major component of total energy expenditure, being responsible for about 75% of daily total energy expenditure [38]. Therefore, any resting metabolic rate (RMR) reduction-induced WL translates into a large impact on energy balance, making subjects more prone to weight regain over time [12, 20]. In agreement with Gomez-Arbelaez et al., herein, we found that the most plausible reason accounting for the not significant reduction of resting metabolic rate (RMR) seen in patients who had the low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) after the Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB) is the preservation of fat free mass (FFM) [20].",856bb9b6-1a2e-4bb6-b2ed-620142dcfeb3
27,discussion4," Preservation of initial resting metabolic rate (RMR) after WL could play a key role in preventing weight regain in the short and long time [39].  In the present study, we found that before Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB) placement, resting metabolic rate (RMR) was slightly but significantly higher in the low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) group than that in the low calorie diet (LCD) group. However, this data is expected because despite the fact that it is widely accepted that fat free mass (FFM) is the major factor determining resting metabolic rate (RMR) [40], other factors, such as hormonal status and age, influence the resting metabolic rate (RMR) [40].",d3b1fb1b-3b87-4d8e-b5e8-b88562e30729
28,discussion5,"  low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) appears to be protective against muscle mass catabolism for at least three reasons: first, low blood sugar’s level inhibits the muscle proteolysis; secondary, ketone bodies suppress the use of protein-derived amino acid by muscle; third, the β-hydroxybutyrate (the main ketone body produced during the ketogenesis process) promotes protein synthesis [18, 41, 42].  We also found that patients were compliant with the diet protocol based on consistent weight loss and presence of ketonuria in accordance with other studies that attended weight loss with low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) [43–46].  Traditionally considered high protein, ketogenic diets are often looked at with concern by clinicians due to the potential harm they pose to renal function.",13f7f40a-1c03-4ff3-adf7-1956722f9d83
29,discussion6," Herein, as reported in a recent meta-analysis of Castellana et al [47], we found that low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) appears safe, considering that not only is it associated to an important improvement in patient’s clinical status but also does not affect renal function.  In the present study, body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA). We are aware that bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA) in severely obese patients has been criticized because of the altered electrical properties in body tissues, which may result in an overestimation of fat free mass (FFM) and an underestimation of FM [27, 28]. However, several studies conducted in patients with obesity validate the use of bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA) for the measure of body composition [25, 48–53].

Furthermore, Faria et al. in a cross-sectional validation study with 73 patients invited to undergo a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA) and afterwards a DXA examination found an almost perfect correlation of FM and fat free mass (FFM) (ICC = 0.832 and ICC = 0.899, respectively) [51].

31,discussion8," Furthermore, FM and fat free mass (FFM) were only measured by bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA) and were not supplemented with additional and more accurate comparative measures, such as X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or air displacement plethysmography (air displacement plethysmography (ADP)) computed tomography (CT). However, Gomez-Arbelaez et al. recently assessed the low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD)-induced changes in body composition of patients with obesity by comparing DXA, bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA), and air displacement plethysmography (ADP) to evaluate those changes [19]. In this study, similarly to the present research, twenty obese patients followed a VLCK diet for 4 months. After 4 months, the VLCK diet induced a − 20.2 ± 4.5-kg weight loss, at expenses of reductions in fat mass (FM) of − 16.5 ± 5.1 kg (DXA), − 18.2 ± 5.8 kg (MF-bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA)), and − 17.7 ± 9.9 kg (air displacement plethysmography (ADP)).",f33afbf7-a268-453e-8865-654c568cd072
32,discussion9," They conclude that a strong correlation was evidenced between the 3 methods of assessing body composition, and that of the 3 body composition techniques used, the MF-bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA) method seems to be more convenient in the clinical setting [19].  Nevertheless, DXA requires specialized radiology equipment and is expensive, and thus hardly feasible in routine clinical practice, whereas CT scan is not cost-effective and radiation exposure would not be acceptable for ethical issues. Therefore, despite the fact that we are aware that bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA), DXA, and CT scan methods cannot be considered interchangeable, if the systematic error associated to the measurements of bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA) is accepted, the latter remains a simple, safe, non-invasive, and low-cost method for FM and fat free mass (FFM) assessment in clinical practice and research studies also in the setting of obesity [25, 48–53].",044162ca-b79e-427d-ac75-03dd4d127f6f
33,discussion10,"  Conclusion  This prospective, randomized, controlled trial shows, despite the small sample size, that in patients undergoing Elipse™ intragastric balloon (EIGB), low calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) is associated with an increased FM loss while reducing the fat free mass (FFM) loss and the resting metabolic rate (RMR), without interfering with renal function when compared with low calorie diet (LCD). Further and larger randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these preliminary data.
