0,methods0," 2.1. Review Design  This systematic review was conducted following a predefined protocol that was registered at the OSF registries (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/2MK5G). The reporting of the literature searching component of the systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses literature search extension (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA)-S) [30], and that of the systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) statement [31]. Ethical approval for this study was not required.  2.2. Criteria for Study Inclusion  The inclusion criteria were designed according to the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study design (Population Intervention Comparator Outcome and Study design (PICOS)) principle.",071de650-e045-45e0-8b83-2a03c3c23b80
1,methods1," Accordingly, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) thath have been conducted on adults with chronic disease; including an intervention group and received KD and a control group and assessed quality of life (QOL) as an outcome were included. Regarding the population, although there is a large variation in the use of the term “chronic disease” [32], studies reporting on chronic disease, defined as a disease that is long in duration, has a slow progression, and is not passed from person to person [33] were included. Studies reporting on adult patients, as defined by the investigators (e.g., aged > 18 years at baseline) were included. Regarding the intervention, although there is no standardized definition of the KD, studies reporting on diets high in fat, low in carbohydrates (CHO) resulting in hyperketonemia [17] such as classical KD, medium-chain triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT))-KD, and modified Atkins diet (MAD) were included.",2e73721c-3047-4f6f-b9ad-d667d392e424
2,methods2," When the intervention was not specified as a KD, an upper limit of 50 g of carbohydrates (CHO) per day or 10% energy from carbohydrates (CHO) [34] was retained for inclusion. RCTs involving a co-intervention were included if both arms of the study received the same co-intervention. Regarding the comparator, studies employing any other type of diet (e.g., low fat diet, anti-inflammatory diet, high fiber diet, or a different form of KD) were included. Regarding the outcome, studies reporting on quality of life (QOL) were included irrespective of the definition adopted, nor of the assessment tool. Finally, regarding study design, only RCTs were included, irrespective of blinding.",7aa54923-3695-4d75-b31f-435f45c480c1
3,methods3,"  Studies were excluded if they were conducted on healthy adults, adults with acute conditions, or on pediatric participants; were conducted on non-human species; were non-randomized or non-controlled; or were reported on in non-original articles without detailed empirical data such as posters, conference abstracts, book chapters, or reviews.  2.3. Search Strategy  The search strategy was validated by a medical librarian. The search involved two key concepts: (1) KD and (2) quality of life (QOL). For each concept, controlled vocabulary such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords were mapped. Search terms included but were not limited to quality of life or well-being, combined with keto or Atkins.

The literature search was conducted on 16 October 2021 by one author (MA), and the electronic search strategy run on Embase via Ovid and PubMed is available in Supplementary Material Table S1. Bibliographies of the included articles and relevant reviews were also hand-searched for eligible studies.  2.4. Study Selection  Two sets of authors (MA/FA; EG/DP) screened titles and/or abstracts retrieved by the search independently and in duplicate, and identified studies that potentially met the inclusion criteria. Then, the full texts of potentially eligible studies were retrieved and assessed independently and in duplicate for eligibility. Study selection was conducted following calibration exercises to ensure the validity of the process. Disagreements were solved through discussions or, in the absence of a consensus, with a third reviewer.  2.5.",92f4edb4-8bb4-48db-acc5-7a4b3333226f
5,methods5," Data Extraction  The same two pairs of authors (MA/FA; EG/DP) extracted data from eligible studies, independently and in duplicate, using a data extraction form, and following a calibration exercise to ensure the validity of the process. For all included articles, the authors extracted the characteristics of the study, details of the population included (number of enrolled patients, demographic characteristics, type of chronic disease), intervention (features of KD, duration of intervention, compliance), comparator, and outcomes (quality of life (QOL), adverse events, and attrition. When studies were lacking information, original references were retrieved for additional data on the design and results.  2.6.",cec2a087-3f78-4826-8b4a-2a59aaf52c2a
6,methods6," Quality Assessment  The same two pairs of authors (MA/FA; EG/DP) assessed the risk of bias of included studies, independently and in duplicate, following the Cochrane criteria (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting) [35]. For each study, each potential source of bias was graded as low, high, or unclear risk. Disagreements were solved through consensus or with the help of a third reviewer.  2.7. Data Synthesis  As a meta-analysis was not possible, the author provided a narrative synthesis of the findings from the studies including the author-recorded characteristics of the study, details of the population included, the intervention, the comparator, the assessment methods and tools as well as the study’s outcomes.  3.

7,methods7," The initial search resulted in 4980 screened records, out of which nine RCTs were included in this review.  3.2. Characteristics of Included Studies  Characteristics of the included RCTs are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Supplementary Material Table S2. Three studies were conducted in the urine analyzer EORTC QLQ C30 Cohen 2018 Birmingham (USA) [36,37,38], and one study took place in each of Trinidad and Tobago [36], Australia [37], Canada [38], UK [39], Iran [40], and in New Zealand [41]. Most of the studies were published within the last two years [37,38,39,41,42,43,44].  Regarding chronic diseases, four studies were conducted on cancer patients (several types of stages 2 and 3 cancer [36], ovarian or endometrial cancer [42], glioblastoma [39], and breast cancer [40]), two on patients with neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis [43] and Alzheimer’s disease [41]), two on patients with obesity, and type II diabetes [37,38], and one on patients with knee osteoarthritis [44].",4094388a-5c91-4dd0-b6a6-0f42d3997215
8,methods8," Regarding the design, only the study by Philips et al. [41], was a two-period crossover RCT.  The prescription of the KD varied between studies including a carbohydrates (CHO) intake less than 20 g per day [42,44], or less than 50 g per day [37,38] or net carbohydrates (CHO) less than 6% of total energy per day [41]. Only in Durrer et al. [38] did the intervention consist of a commercial ketogenic weight loss diet plan supplemented with whole foods; whereas in Augustus et al. [36], Lee et al. [43], and Martin McGill et al. [39], the intervention consisted of medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD. The duration of intervention ranged between 12 weeks [38,40,41,42,44] and 12 months [37]. Achievement of ketosis was measured either by blood ketones [36,37,39,40,41,42,43,44], mainly beta-hydroxybutyrate, or urinary ketones [36,39]; whereas only Strath et al. [44] did not assess ketosis.",7d47c0ce-eb2b-42be-ada2-1037f8c2746e
9,methods9," The comparators varied between standard traditional diet [36,40], energy-restricted, high carbohydrates (CHO) diet [37], the American Cancer Society diet [42], Diabetes Canada diet [38], modified Paleolithic diet [43], low fat diet [44], and usual diet [41,43,44]. Only Martin McGill et al. [39] compared two forms of the KD: medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD and the modified MKD.  quality of life (QOL) was assessed using a variety of tools including disease-specific questionnaires such as the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer current core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) [36,39,40], the Diabetes-39 questionnaire [37], the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 questionnaire [43], the Quality of Life in AD questionnaire [41], and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score quality of life questionnaire [44] or generic questionnaires such as the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF) [38,42].",10daa9f1-c52b-4db0-9051-4391b1ff9fd7

18,methods20," Assessment of Risk of Bias  Results of the assessment of risk of bias of the included RCTs are detailed in Figure 2. Risk of bias regarding sequence generation was low for all studies, expect for Strath et al. [44]. Allocation was concealed in Brinkworth et al. [37], Durrer et al. [38], Khodabakhshi et al. [40], Martin-McGill et al. [39], and Philips et al. [41], and was unclear in the remaining trials [36,37,38,39]. Personnel were blinded only in the studies by Brinkworth et al. [37], Lee et al. [43], and Philips et al. [41]. In general, risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessment and completeness of outcome data was low. Finally, selective reporting was suspected for the studies by Augustus et al. [36], Cohen et al. [42], Martin McGill et al. [39], and Strath et al. [44].

19,methods21," Results of Included Studies  The findings from the included studies are summarized in Table 2 and detailed in Supplementary Material Table S2. As shown in Table 2a, in patients with a diagnosis of cancer, the evidence regarding the effect of KD on quality of life (QOL) was inconclusive [36,39,40,42]. Augustus et al. [36] found a significant improvement in overall quality of life (QOL), whereas Cohen et al. [42] reported improved quality of life (QOL) only at the level of physical component summary. In the study conducted by Martin McGill et al. [39], quantitative results were limited to only three patients, favoring the MKD. Finally, Khodabakhshi et al. [40] found no significant differences in the effects of KD and regular diet on all domains of quality of life (QOL).  Additionally, among patients with neurological disorders, conflicting results were noted, whereby Philips et al.",5f1cca7c-1dc7-4691-b98d-4a9533b50dc5
20,methods22," [41] reported improved quality of life (QOL) in Alzheimer’s disease patients on the KD compared with those on a usual diet, whereas Lee et al. [43] found no significant difference in mental health and physical health quality of life (QOL) scores among the compared groups in patients with multiple sclerosis.  Similarly, among patients with obesity and Type II diabetes [37,38], contradictory results were noted. Durrer et al. [38] showed that a ketogenic, energy-restricted diet resulted in improved measures of role functioning, mental health, health perceptions, and pain compared with a diet and lifestyle conforming with the Diabetes Clinical Practice Guidelines, whereas Brinkworth et al. [37] found that both high and low carbohydrates (CHO) diets achieved comparable improvements in quality of life (QOL).  Finally, among patients with knee osteoarthritis [44], there were non-significant differences between the KD and low-fat groups after post hoc analysis.",5f0bb3f7-cabf-4aae-a9a5-52a5ce4039bb

Dietary Compliance with the Ketogenic Diet  As Table 2b shows, the results of dietary compliance with the KD were reported only in three studies [37,38,40]. Whenever investigated, good dietary compliance was reported [37,38,40], reaching 98% in the study by Durrer et al. [38], and 96% in the study by Khodabakhshi et al. [40]. Interestingly, in the latter study [40], only 66.7% of the group had serum ketones above 0.5 mmol/L at 12 weeks.  3.6.",a916f034-3e92-409e-962e-f42a944d00ac
36,methods38," Adverse Events  Adverse events were not investigated in the studies by Cohen et al. [42] and Strath et al. [44]. In the studies conducted by Lee et al. [43] and Khodabakhshi et al. [40], no adverse events of the KD were noted. In the study by Augustus et al. [36], side-effects were mostly noted during the first two to six weeks, relating to the keto-induction phase, and they consisted mainly of feelings of fatigue and dizziness. In the studies by Brinkworth et al. [37] and Philips et al. [41], there were no marked differences in the adverse events between patients receiving KD and those receiving the comparison diet. Details about the specific side effects are reported in Table 2b.  4. Discussion  This systematic review explored the effect of KD on quality of life (QOL) among adults with chronic disease. Overall, we could not find conclusive evidence about the effectiveness of the different forms of the KD in improving quality of life (QOL) in this patient population.",b1a88b2c-111a-4074-9419-2ce66d86d3e6
37,methods39," This finding is limited by the divergent dietary regimens used for prescribing the KD, the heterogeneity of the subjects in the studies, and chronic diseases assessed as well as the methodological variations between studies such as a comparison, and the assessment methods of ketosis and quality of life (QOL).  All included publications were recent (2016–2021), reflecting increased attention to KD in the scientific literature for health-related outcomes beyond those related to the management of epilepsy [45]. The KD has been advocated for improving the quality of life (QOL) of healthy and ill people due to several biologically plausible mechanisms. One suggested theory is the effect of ketone bodies, specifically B-hydroxybutyrate, in inducing mild euphoria [46]. Qualitative findings from the study by Martin-McGill et al.",fcd74941-0418-46c5-a2c5-20996ae37576
38,methods40," [39] illustrate this, with patients reported “experiencing a fantastic quality of life” and describing the diet as offering a sense of control whilst receiving their tumor treatment”. BHB has shared actions with gamma-hydroxybutyrate (gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB)) on the brain. gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a catabolite in the brain of gamma-aminobutyrate (gamma aminobutyrate (GABA)), thus lowering cerebral energy requirements and playing a neuroprotective role [47]. Another plausible theory could be the weight-loss effect of the KD. Weight loss is suggested to improve health-related quality of life (QOL); this relationship is consistent with considerable loss such as the case after bariatric surgery [48]. Furthermore, the potential positive effect of KD on quality of life (QOL) could be attributed to its anti-inflammatory effect. It is hypothesized that excess dietary carbohydrates (CHO) contribute to oxidative stress, pain, and inflammation [44].",2a3792e7-31c1-4894-bf9e-dc8e430b0348
39,methods41," Chronic inflammation significantly predicts lower quality of life (QOL) in emotional and relational measures [49,50].  Specifically, in cancer patients, the effects of the KD on quality of life (QOL) could be secondary to its therapeutic effects. For example, an increasing number of preclinical studies suggest the KD as a potent anticancer therapy because of its direct effects on tumor growth, which may improve the overall health status of patients as well as their quality of life (QOL) [51,52]. In patients with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, although the literature is scarce and lacks scientific rigor, KD seems to improve the cognitive symptomatology of these diseases, hence its speculated effect on quality of life (QOL) in this patient population [53].",2bb19883-a79f-4737-98e6-a76276021dad
40,methods42," The possible neuroprotective effects of the KD could potentially reside in its beneficial effect on reducing accumulation of amyloid plaques, protecting against amyloid-beta toxicity, and through the modification of the neuronal network activity, although precise mechanisms remain unknown. Furthermore, BHB has cellular signaling functions [54] that broadly link the outside environment to cellular function through epigenetic gene regulation, with potential implications on human aging [55]. Finally, the KD diet is reportedly associated with improvements in food cravings, increased levels of physical activity, sleep, and sexual function, and decreased medication need [45,56]. These effects may be of utmost interest to type 2 diabetic patients.  The scientific literature highlights the lack of a standardized definition of the KD.",15bce6f0-b440-4785-9b8f-444c51451f61
41,methods43," Commonly, this diet is characterized by a reduction in carbohydrates (CHO) below 10% of daily energy intake or typically 30 to 50 g of carbohydrates (CHO) per day, and a relative increase in fat intake, with a fat-to-carbohydrates (CHO) and protein intake ratio of 3:1 to 4:1 [57]. The included studies in this systematic review varied in their definition of the KD, the level of carbohydrates (CHO) restriction as well as protein and fat intakes, in addition to the inclusion of medium chain triglyceride (MCT) as a source of fat. Furthermore, the use of KD and induction of ketosis were not explicit in some included studies, nevertheless, the features of the interventional diet were in accordance with that of a KD.  There was also a variation in the definition of physiological ketosis with different cut-off values used in different studies as well as the assessment of ketosis, varying between blood and urinary ketones.",c5bbfc76-ae5d-4b8e-9977-4b4cf4a903d8
42,methods44," Specifically, regarding the latter method, urinary ketones were used to monitor the diet in numerous studies [36,39,42]. Urinary ketones may not be robust markers of compliance, as they can be affected by hydration status, some medications or substances such as vitamin C. Furthermore, the reading is an average of urine ketone levels since the last void. Finally, some kits only measure acetoacetic levels and others have a short shelf-life [56]. Of interest, apparently low urinary ketones may discourage patients when they are adhering to the diet robustly [39]; this is to be considered for future RCTs investigating the KD. In addition, only the two studies conducted by Augustus et al. [36] and Cohen et al. [42] reported on the relationship between ketone bodies and quality of life (QOL).",b9b4fdb6-7b1b-4e03-8096-b4950cc99a76
43,methods45," The results of the two studies were contradictory: while the first reported an inverse association between urinary ketones and quality of life (QOL), the latter reported no association between physical nor mental health and serum BHB, hence a conclusion on this relationship cannot be drawn.  Importantly, participant blinding was impossible in all trials. It is thus likely that improvements noted with the KD may be biased by the increased attention given to patients through consultations, education, and follow-up, and by the fact that patients had the sense that they were actively participating in treatment to enhance their disease condition [36]. These factors were not measured in the trials, hence cannot be controlled with the analysis. Furthermore, remarkable adherence was noted in this systematic review. This finding should be interpreted with caution since only three studies (i.e., Brinkworth et al. [37], Durrer et al. [38], and Khodabakhshi et al.",e3bb6dd1-1213-4aa5-b1c3-10d55d062982
44,methods46," [40]) reported the results of the dietary compliance, and in these studies, compliance was self-reported, which may be subject to recall bias, error and inaccuracy, or social desirability bias [58]. Low adherence to the KD in adult patients with cancer was reported in a recent systematic review (49%) [25]. Adherence to the KD requires drastic changes, which could hinder long-term compliance [59]. Indeed, Augustus et al. [36] presented the case that the KD may not be offered to all patients and that being unable to adhere to the KD or struggling to be adapted to it may adversely affect the quality of life (QOL) and mental health of patients.  Interestingly, in the majority of included studies, adverse events did not greatly differ between the KD and its comparison. Furthermore, commonly reported side effects with the KD included fatigue, dizziness, and gastrointestinal symptoms.",33e32f7f-4287-431c-a1b6-f1766366eb3b
45,methods47," These effects, mainly reported in the first weeks of adopting the KD, are attributed to the keto-induction period, which varies greatly inter-individual [60,61]. Specifically, Augustus et al. [36] reported a small but distinct gender-based difference in this period, whereby men adapted faster to the KD as well as an age-based difference, with younger individuals adapting faster than their older counterparts. The keto-induction period involves a course of immediate side-effects known as the keto-flu, which coincide with a high level of ketone bodies. These effects steadily attenuate over time with keto-adaptation (i.e., organ homeostasis to using ketones as the primary source of energy [60]).  Strengths and Limitations  This was the first study to compile evidence from RCTs on the effect of KD diet on quality of life (QOL) in adults with chronic diseases.",f39e7aa0-f390-4d9d-b256-1d2f82aac71c
46,methods48," We adopted a sensitive search strategy, followed the recommended methods for applying the search, selection of studies, data extraction, and quality assessment as well as best-practices for the reporting of the review [30,31]. Moreover, when studies were lacking information, original references were retrieved for additional data on design and results. Finally, the risk of bias of the majority of included studies was low, except for the allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel.  On the other hand, the review is limited by the heterogeneity of included studies, which complicates the comparisons and the interpretation of the findings, specifically regarding assessed populations, assessment methods, and study outcomes.",85254dbf-2153-41b2-a2da-2da8ef111c7d
47,methods49," Additionally, some studies lacked information crucial for the interpretation of the results such as baseline quality of life (QOL) values, adverse events, assessment of ketosis, and proportion of participants with sustained physiological ketosis throughout the trial. Having such information would have helped us interpret the findings in a better manner. Moreover, the search, despite being highly broad and sensitive, might have missed some relevant studies. This limitation is common to systematic reviews. Other limitations related to being unable to access one potentially eligible study for full text screening, and excluding additional two studies in this phase due to lack of information on randomization and unavailability of outcome data in the published article. We tried to contact the respective authors, without an answer. Finally, given the heterogeneity of the studies included, meta-analyzing their results was impossible.  5.",2761d1eb-9378-4298-836c-0bb5c5c1fb5d
48,methods50," Conclusions  In conclusion, the evidence from RCTs investigating the effect of KD on quality of life (QOL) in adults with chronic disease is inconclusive. The promising effect noted in some included studies, and the low rates of adverse events and side effects encourage future investigations in this regard. Hence, additional high-quality, powered trials with long enough follow-up periods, are warranted to elucidate the effect of the KD on quality of life (QOL) in adults with chronic disease and explore the optimal diet composition and timing of initiation for optimal outcomes.
