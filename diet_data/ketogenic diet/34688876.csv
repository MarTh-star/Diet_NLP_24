11,discussion0," The present study evaluated the role of IF and KD in glycemic and weight control among patients with T2DM. The analysis carried out in the current research has shown that KD significantly reduced HBA1c and body weight compared with control interventions. However, the meta-analysis reported an insignificant impact on BMI values. On the other hand, IF showed a decrease in HBA1c and body weight. However, when compared to control interventions, the difference was statistically insignificant. The analysis of the three included studies also showed that IF significantly reduces the BMI values compared to the control interventions.  We initially hypothesized that IF would significantly decrease the body weight, BMI, and HBA1c percentage in patients with T2DM. However, our results have shown that IF has a similar effect on HBA1c as the control interventions, which constitute mainly continuous energy restriction (continuous energy restriction (CER)).",8f2e8f62-ef88-4c78-ba8a-27d8dc0c8975
12,discussion1," These results are reinforced by a previous meta-analysis of six randomized studies, which reported that IF showed an insignificant decrease in HBA1c compared with the control arm (SMD = -0.11%; 95% CI: -0.38%, 0.17%) [25]. Similarly, a previous randomized trial reported that after 20 weeks of dietary interventions, no difference in HBA1c values was observed between the IF and standard diet groups [26]. However, the study reported that the target HBA1c was achieved mostly by patients in the IF group. Wing RR et al. also claimed that IF had a similar effect on HBA1c as the low-calorie diet [27]. Even though our results show an insignificant impact on HBA1c, evidence in some of the included studies has shown that HBA1c levels are affected by the duration of intervention. For example, Carter S et al. [14] reported that the HBA1c was comparable with the interventions, but a significant decrease in HBA1c with time was recorded (-0.7 ± 0.9% P<0.001).",60cff490-ed6f-4872-986d-90185fc3976d
13,discussion2," Other measures, such as fasting glucose, are also vital in understanding the impact of IF on glycemic control. Corley BT et al. reported that non-consecutive and consecutive fasting has no significant impact on fasting glucose (7.9 (1.7) vs. 6.9 (2.1) mmol/l, P = 0.21) [17]. Similarly, Wing RR et al. [27] showed that patients following the intermittent, very-low-calorie, and low-calorie diets had comparable fasting glucose outcomes (9.78 + 3.28 vs. 9.28 + 3.67, respectively).  Additionally, our meta-analysis shows that IF reduced the body weight of patients with T2DM by 1.05 kg. These results are supported by a recent meta-analysis which recorded a significant weight loss of 1.89 kg [25]. Similarly, a three-phase observational study evaluating the impact of IF in adult patients with T2DM also recorded a significant weight loss of 1.395 kg during the second phase (two-week intervention) [28]. The study also shows that during the third phase (two-week follow-up), a 1.",768883a3-ca84-4dc4-a32e-c375d3884fdd
14,discussion3,"12 kg weight loss was recorded. However, the mean difference between the first and third phases showed that the weight loss was insignificant (p = 0.08). This insignificant change can be attributed to the patients returning to a normal diet in the third phase. A much greater weight loss in T2DM patients has been reported in a study that applied three different isocaloric diet regimens [29]. Results of that study showed that the patients had lost 6% of their initial body weight at the end of 12 weeks (6.4 + 4.6 kg; P < 0.001). However, after 18 months, 85.2% of the patients regained >1kg, and no weight loss was recorded thereafter. The great weight loss recorded in that study can be explained by the fact that it included only male patients. According to a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis, men were found to lose more weight than women [30].",45534a97-766c-4559-880c-60c2c6617e5b
15,discussion4," This substantial decrease in weight can be related to the fact that men contain more metabolically active tissues than women, thus contributing to a higher resting energy expenditure and greater weight loss [31,32].  Our results have also shown that IF significantly decreases the BMI among T2DM patients. These results are supported by a previous randomized crossover study which reported that IF significantly reduced BMI. The study showed that patients who took two meals per day had a significantly higher reduction in BMI than patients that took six meals every day (-1.23 vs. -0.82kg/m2, p<0.001) [33]. Evidence also shows that IF has an effect on the medication effect score (medication effect score (MES)). A decrease in medication effect score (MES) corresponds to a reduction in medication dosages, while an increase in medication effect score (MES) corresponds to an increase in diabetes medications. According to Carter S et al.",8cda7e7f-383b-44c5-8260-878d9b64a5a9
16,discussion5," [16], the total mean medication effect score (MES) decreased with time. However, no significant difference was observed between the intermittent energy restriction (intermittent energy restriction (IER)) and continuous energy restriction (CER) groups (-0.6 (0.1) vs. -0.3 (0.1), respectively; p=0.1). Similarly, a 2016 study showed that total mean medication effect score (MES) decreased with time, but there was no significant difference between the treatment groups (-0.4 ± 0.6 vs. -0.4 ± 0.5 for continuous energy restriction (CER) and intermittent energy restriction (IER), respectively) [14]. A randomized trial also reported that after 52 weeks, 15% of patients in the intermittent low-energy diet group (intermittent low energy diet group (ILED)) and 43% of patients in the continuous low-energy diet group (continuous low energy diet group (CLED)) had a reduction in diabetes medication.",42ae99b0-9780-4b05-b58a-fbe9859ad3d2
17,discussion6," However, the total mean medication effect score (MES) was not significantly different between the treatment group (0.1 (-0.1, 0.4) vs. -0.5 (-0.8, -0.2) for intermittent low energy diet group (ILED) and continuous low energy diet group (CLED), respectively) [15].  Even though we have shown that IF has promising glycemic and weight control outcomes, it is subject to side effects. Evidence shows that the most occurring side effect of intermittent fasting is hypoglycemia. Corley BT et al. evaluated the risk of developing hypoglycemia among T2DM patients following the 5:2 IF protocol and found that over a 12-week observation period, 53 hypoglycemic events were recorded in 15 participants [17]. The study's results also showed that the risk of developing hypoglycemic events was twice greater during the fasting period (RR 2.05 (95% CI 1.17-3.52); P=0.013).",9ac5f063-928a-4405-947d-e5659a5de9d4
18,discussion7," However, no significant difference was observed in hypoglycemic events between the consecutive and non-consecutive fasting groups (relative risk (RR) 1.54 (95% CI: 0.35-6.11); P = 0.51). Similarly, a more recent study evaluating the risk of hypoglycemia during Ramadhan fasting in diabetic patients reported that 13.3% with T2DM had hypoglycemic events [34]. However, the analysis in this study showed that patients with T1DM were significantly at a higher risk of developing hypoglycemia than patients with T2DM (p<0.0001). This study also reported that substantially higher age was recorded for patients with hypoglycemia and T2DM. Apart from hypoglycemia, other adverse events, including diarrhea, fatigue, headaches, constipation, and dizziness, have also been associated with IF. McDiarmid S et al. [15] reported six diarrhea cases, three fatigue cases, one headache case, two constipation cases, and one nausea/vomiting case for patients in the intermittent low energy diet group (ILED) group.",98482e9e-7908-48dc-87b9-169abf293297
19,discussion8," Li C et al. [13] also reported that three participants reported headaches during fasting, while one patient reported slight dizziness during the later fasting days.  The current study also hypothesized that KD would significantly reduce HBA1c, body weight, and BMI. This hypothesis was supported since the pooled effect showed that KD significantly reduced the body weight of patients with T2DM by 1.91 kg. These results are consistent with our previous meta-analysis, which reported a 2.67 kg weight reduction for patients following the KD protocols [35]. Similarly, a previous meta-analysis of four randomized trials reported a significant weight loss among T2DM patients following the KD protocol than patients subjected to other diets (SMD: -4.26kg; 95% CI; -6.88 kg, -1.63 kg; p = 0.001; I2 = 81%) [36]. Other consistent results have been reported in a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials, which recorded a significant weight loss of 7.78 kg for patients in the KD group [37].",eb05c54c-8e91-450c-b622-3ff641d5323e
20,discussion9," The significant weight loss recorded by patients following the KD can be attributed to various reasons. First, KD involves eating foods with more fat and protein, which have greater satiety than carbohydrates, partly because they have longer digestion time, thus slowing down the stomach release, and partly because they induce more ketone, which lowers the patients’ appetite [7,38]. These effects have been described as pleasant since the patients feel they can control their appetite, which is new to them. Secondly, the high protein intake attained during the KD is associated with better muscle mass preservation, stimulating energy expenditure and causing more weight loss [22]. Some contradictory results have been presented in some of the included studies. Tay J et al. [24] reported an insignificant difference in weight loss after a 24-week follow-up between the very low-carbohydrate and high-carbohydrate groups (-12.0 (6.3) kg vs. -11.5 (5.5) kg, respectively; p=0.57) [24].",60e70ede-2949-405e-ac6d-70c85298101f
21,discussion10," The results of the current meta-analysis have also shown that KD has an insignificant difference compared with control diets in BMI reduction (p=0.49). These results are reinforced by our previous meta-analysis, which reported an insignificant difference in BMI between patients following the KD and other dietary interventions (SMD: -0.31 kg/m2; 95% CI; -0.81 kg/m2, 0.20 kg/m2; P=0.23, I2 = 84%) [35]. Choi YJ et al. also reported that KD had an insignificant reduction in BMI compared with control interventions (SMD: -0.63 kg/m2; 95% CI; -1.31 kg/m2, 0.08 kg/m2; P = 0.08, I2 = 87%) [37]. However, a previous study by Li S et al. [39] reported that after a 12-week follow-up, patients in the KD group recorded a significantly lower BMI than patients subjected to a diabetic diet (26.21 ± 5.74 vs. 29.42 ± 5.97, respectively). The significant change recorded in this study can be explained by the fact that KD stimulated different starvation degrees.",20446510-5272-4511-a93e-28f8f2631b95
22,discussion11," Thus, the body uses the energy supplied by the ketone body.  Additionally, the results of the current study have supported the initial hypothesis by showing that KD significantly reduced the HBA1c. The reduction of 2% in HBA1c reported in the present study is consistent with the results of previous meta-analyses, which showed a significant decrease of 1.02% in HBA1c [36]. The reduction in HBA1c can be explained by the fact that KD also reduced body weight among patients with T2DM. Another important measure for glycemic control discussed in previous studies is fasting glucose. Goday A et al. [20] reported that patients that followed the KD protocol achieved a significant reduction in fasting glucose than patients that followed the low-calorie diet protocol (108.9 (20.4) mg/dL vs. 123.3 (24.3) mg/dL).",59d0fc91-71ee-42d2-99c7-0ad554a2ae86
23,discussion12," These results are reinforced by a previous study that reported that KD lowered the fasting insulin, thus stabilizing blood glucose and alleviating any blood glucose fluctuations in T2DM patients [40]. Despite the current meta-analysis showing that KD offers better weight and glycemic control outcomes, evidence has shown that it has some side effects. Westman EC et al. reported that the most common adverse effects recorded in their study were headache and constipation, with an occurrence rate of 53.1% among patients in the KD group [18]. Other side effects, such as diarrhea, insomnia, and back pain, accounted for 40.6%, 31.2%, and 34.4% of patients in the KD groups. Tay J et al. [24] also reported that five patients in the KD group experienced musculoskeletal ailments, two reported cases of GI disorders, including constipation and diverticulitis, and one patient was diagnosed with prostate cancer.",529894be-f62e-40f0-b51b-4cf5a19aff85
24,discussion13," Due to these side effects, dietitians are required to provide appropriate guidance to the patients.  Limitations  The primary limitation of the current study is the high heterogeneity recorded during meta-analysis. However, high heterogeneity is expected since the dietary interventions used in each study were not standardized. Additionally, the varying sample sizes recorded in each study could have contributed to the high heterogeneity. Due to this high heterogeneity, the results of our meta-analyses should be interpreted with caution; however, most of the studies used in the review were of good methodological quality, thus minimizing the publication bias. The other limitation of the current study is based on the eligibility criteria, which allowed the inclusion of studies published in English only. This specification may have led to omitting some relevant information that would have otherwise been used to improve the statistical power of our meta-analysis.",76d49233-57b0-4c42-aecd-7d40f18eaccd
25,discussion14," The current study also did not categorize the IF protocols used in each study, therefore; making it difficult to understand the effectiveness of different IF protocols on weight and glycemic control.  Conclusions  The increasing prevalence of T2DM across the world requires effective primary-care treatments. Some potential methods to reduce the incidence and severity of T2DM include IF and KD. These methods can manage T2DM through weight loss and glycemic control. The current study has shown that IF reduces both body weight and HBA1c; however, compared with control diets consisting mainly of continuous energy restriction (CER) diets shows an insignificant difference. The pooled results have also suggested that IF significantly reduced BMI compared to control interventions. On the other hand, the KD diet has proved to be an effective strategy in reducing body weight and HBA1c.",fb6b8ab9-1c58-4ed1-a6d9-1ee163185ae1
26,discussion15," Despite the benefits of IF and KD on weight and glycemic control, it is essential to note that the regimens have potential side effects. Therefore, the interventions should be used cautiously and under the health professional’s supervision. Evidence has also shown that IF studies, including male patients, show higher weight loss; however, more research is required to compare the effect of gender on weight loss. Based on our result, we can suggest that IF and KD are reliable methods for weight loss; however, the high heterogeneity recorded makes it challenging to compare the effect of the two diets on weight loss and glycemic control. Future research should be carried out to directly compare the effectiveness of KD and IF on weight and glycemic control.  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. =",c3015932-cf98-442a-b0ba-3a831730ef50
