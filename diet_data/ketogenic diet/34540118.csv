0,methods0," 4.1. Animals  All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; ethical code number: LAC-2010-0050) of Taipei Medical University (Taipei City, Taiwan). Male C57BL/6 mice (6-week-old, weighing 22–24 g) were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei City, Taiwan) and were housed in standard cages (room temperature: 20–26°C; humidity: 55 ± 5%; 12 h light–dark cycle). The mice were pair-fed a liquid diet containing maltose and dextrin.  4.2. Study Design  In the present study, after 1 week of acclimatization, the male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into two groups as follows: the AIN-93M group (n = 12) and the LC group (n = 48).",f328e06a-a0d4-4318-9938-2c46b4d5bda6
1,methods1," After 12 weeks, the AIN-93M group was maintained on the AIN-93M diet, and the LC group was randomly divided into four groups: one was maintained on the original diet (LC, n = 12), the second was changed to the AIN-93M diet (LC/AIN-93M, n = 12), the third changed to a ketogenic diet (LC/KD, n = 12), and the final group changed to a ketogenic diet with curcumin supplementation (LC/KDCu, n = 12) for 6 weeks. The curcumin powder was dissolved in the soybean oil and mixed in the liquid diet. The ingredients of each diet are shown in Table 1.  4.3. Histological Analysis  Formalin-fixed testis tissues were prepared and analyzed at the Department of Pathology of Cardinal Tien Hospital (New Taipei City, Taiwan), being embedded, cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) following standard protocols. The samples were observed and captured under a DM1000 microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).",71d9db82-7950-453c-a398-12444f841b48
2,methods2," The thickness of the testicular germinal epithelium (GE) and the mean seminiferous tubule diameter (mean seminiferous tubule diameter (MSTD)) were calculated across axes using Image J software (1.50, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The GE size was measured using the average length of a lumen and the length of a seminiferous tubule, and at least 10 sections were calculated in each mouse. Johnsen’s score was used to evaluate testicular spermatogenesis. The degree of testicular damages was tested using a 1–10-point scale ranging from the highest score of 10, standing for complete spermatogenesis, to 1, indicating no seminiferous epithelium.  4.4. Serum Analysis  After anaesthetization, blood from the heart sat for 20–30 min at room temperature before being centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm and separated the resulting supernatant.",1af48163-726c-40a0-bdde-1c8d1b677b00
3,methods3," Total cholesterol (TC, mg/dL), triglyceride (TG, mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL), mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (aminotransferase (AST), U/L), and alanine aminotransferase (aminotransferase (ALT), U/L) levels were measured using a chemistry analyzer (Modular P800, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Serum ketone (mmol/L) and glucose (mg/dL) levels were measured using a GLUCOSURE POC system (ApexBio AB-302G, Hsinchu, Taipei, Taiwan). The serum insulin level (pmol/L) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) using a commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Mercodia Mouse Insulin enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 10-1247-01, Uppsala, Sweden).  4.5. Sperm Quality Analysis  Sperm quality was assessed according to sperm motility, sperm count and morphological abnormality.",ff42232e-3f4e-445e-9554-2b61c89b8912
4,methods4," Sperm motility was expressed as the percentage of motile sperm evaluated microscopically under a magnification of 40× in four random microscopic fields, and at least 200 sperm cells were counted. The sperm count was measured using an automated cell counter (TC20, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).  For sperm morphology, sperm slides were fixed with methanol (Honeywell, Morris Plains, NJ, USA) and stained with an eosin Y (E4009, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) and ethanol (Bioman, Taipei City, Taiwan) mixture. Then, the slides were rinsed with 75% ethanol (Bioman) and dried. Finally, the percentage of morphologically normal sperm within at least 100 sperm cells was calculated.  4.6. Testicular Hormone, Antioxidants and Marker of Lipid Peroxidation Analysis  Testis tissues were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors and centrifuged at 14,000× g (4 °C) for 20 min.",206c3cd5-d2f5-428c-94c2-d46f6d8d6e83

The antioxidants and marker of lipid peroxidation, including superoxide dismutase (superoxide dismutase (SOD), U/mL; Cayman, Item No. 706002), catalase (catalase (CAT), µM; Cayman, Item No. 707002), glutathione peroxidase (GPx, nmol/min/mL; Cayman, Item No. 703102) and malondialdehyde (MDA, µM; Cayman, Item No. 10009055) were also evaluated using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits.  4.7. Western Blotting Analysis  Total protein was extracted from testis tissues using RIPA lysis buffer, and the concentrations determined using a detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad).",5e0e1c77-b00f-4a35-a1f0-642f289f2a8d
6,methods6," Equal quantities of protein were resolved using sodium dodecyl sulfate (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS))-polyacrylamide gels (Bioman) and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)) membranes (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). The polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) dried milk with 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (Tween 20 in Tris buffered saline (TBST)) for 1 h and incubated overnight with the following primary antibodies: StAR (1:1000; sc-25806, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), 3β-HSD (1:500; sc-28206, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 17β-HSD (1:250; sc-135044, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CYP11A1 (1:1000; sc-202456, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CYP17A1 (1:1000; sc-66850, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), caspase 8 (1:1000; 59607, GeneTex, San Antonio, TX, USA), Bax (1:1000; 2772, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), caspase 9 (1:1000; 9508, Cell Signaling Technology), caspase 3 (1:500; 9662,",eb14cf4d-586a-4d74-9ea6-6cb35941f7c4

After incubation, the membranes were washed with Tween 20 in Tris buffered saline (TBST) and incubated with secondary antibodies anti-mouse IgG (1:5000; sc-2005, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:4000; sc-2054, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were visualized using an ECL kit (Omicsbio, Taipei City, Taiwan). The intensity of each band was quantified using Image J software and normalized to the expression of β-actin.  4.8.",4ca3a86f-902f-4865-9e89-f1ad7c6a6191
8,methods8," Statistical Analysis  All the data are presented as means ± SD. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (analyzed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) followed by Duncan’s new multiple range test. Differences were defined as statistically significant if the p-value was less than 0.05. Pearson’s test was used to analyze the correlation between variables. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).  5. Conclusions  In summary, the results of our study confirmed that a low-carbohydrate diet led to a lower sperm quality and damaged testicular histology. Supplementation with curcumin may improve the impaired sperm and testis function via decreasing oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.
