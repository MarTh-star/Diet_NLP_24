0,introduction0,"Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA)) is a heterogeneous group of rare diseases. There are two main types of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA): type 1, pantothenate kinase associated with neurodegeneration (pantothenate kinase associated with neurodegeneration (PKAN)), most often caused by the mutation of the PANK2 gene [1]; and type 2, mitochondrial protein–associated neurodegeneration (mitochondrial protein–associated neurodegeneration (MPAN)), caused by the mutation of the c19orf12 gene [2]. Besides those two types, there are other types of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) genes [3].  Pediatric neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) occurs before the age of 10. There are two clinical presentations which depend on the age of the onset.",b619da2b-b402-407e-8f01-fd10d91d437a
1,introduction1," The first one, which begins between the 1st and 2nd years of age, is characterized by muscle stiffness, generalized dystonia with torsional positioning of the feet and hands, and symptoms of oral-mandibular-vocal dystonia. In addition, there are parkinsonism symptoms and increased backward torso deflection, which impede breathing and nutrition, as well as anarthria and dysphagia. The second one, which begins after 5 years of age, has similar clinical presentation, but significantly slower progression.  The early-onset form is considered to be an incurable disease with a high risk of premature death and, as such, is an indication for pediatric palliative care [4].  In Poland, the first neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) patient was admitted to the Warsaw Hospice for Children (Warsaw Hospice for Children (WHC)) in 1998.",d82d956f-b760-41c4-862b-963f27a4a805
2,introduction2,"  Objective The aim of the study is to assess pediatric palliative home care as a new approach for children with neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) and their families.  Material and methods The clinical data was obtained from the Warsaw Hospice for Children (WHC) database. The ketogenic diets were designed with Diet-5d program of the National Food and Nutrition Institute. Densitometry was performed at the Department of Biochemistry and Experimental Medicine at the Children’s Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw, Poland. The total body (without the head) (TB BMD) bone mineral density and the bone mechanical strength index (TB BMC/LBM) were examined. To treat spasticity, botulinum toxin (Dysport, dosage between 22 and 50 units/kg) was injected into the muscles (by the third author). There was a two-stage effectiveness evaluation protocol—2 weeks and 3 months after the procedure, which was carried out by the Warsaw Hospice for Children (WHC) physiotherapist.",dd369b9a-4be6-4252-bbf5-da9affed2045
3,introduction3,"  Deep brain stimulation was conducted by the Department of Neurosurgery, the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, Poland.  The quality of palliative care was assessed on the basis of a feedback questionnaire for parents of patients who died at home under the Warsaw Hospice for Children (WHC) care [5]. For the families of the living children, a new version of the quality questionnaire was designed (not yet published). The study covers the period between 1998 and 2018.

All of the patients were referred to the Warsaw Hospice for Children (WHC) from the Department of Neurology and Epileptology at the Children’s Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw, Poland. The referral was given by the second author of the present article.  The age of the patients on admission to the Warsaw Hospice for Children (WHC) was 9 years in average (from 7 to 14 years) (Table 4). It should be noticed that the disease occurred a couple of years earlier and its evolution was very fast, depending on the type of the gene mutation.",304e6c68-7db8-490a-b4f1-d31baf31a784
5,results1," The average period of home palliative care lasted 1569 days (from 34 days to 17 years), i.e., over 4 years. Six children passed away, and three are still alive. The average age of death was 11 years (from 7 to 15 years).  In all the cases, the treatment was carried at the patients’ homes. Five of the patients died at home, and one was admitted to the hospital, due to parental decision, where he passed away after 6 days (A). One child (G) was discharged from the Warsaw Hospice for Children (WHC) as the result of parental request.

21,discussion0,"A group of experts associated with the TIRCON research project (Treat Iron-Related Childhood-Onset Neurodegeneration) recommends early involvement of palliative care team after the diagnosis of the type 1 pantothenate kinase associated with neurodegeneration (PKAN) [7]. However, in the available literature, there are no reports regarding the use of palliative care in this group of patients.  It should be stressed that neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is significantly different from other neurodegenerative disorders of childhood. The neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) patients are permanently aware of their symptoms and suffering, although they cannot verbally communicate pain which is secondary to dystonia (Table 1). Therefore, based on the authors’ experience, palliative care embracing all treatments described in the present article is the only effective approach.",f3669a24-bb25-4b04-ad7d-2ec4004f8d31
22,discussion1," What is also worth emphasizing is the fact that these treatments can be successfully provided at home where the children feel safer and more comfortable than at hospital.  The symptoms which cause suffering in children with neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) are secondary to neurodegeneration. Dystonia as the dominant symptom leads to deformation. Different types of pain are caused by spasticity (muscular and joint pain), fractures (bone pain), headaches (vegetative pain), micturition disorders and constipation (visceral pain), esophagitis due to gastroesophageal reflux, and other inflammatory conditions (inflammatory pain). Diagnosing pain as a cause of restlessness is difficult because of dystonia, anarthria, and intellectual impairment. In such cases, the first-line treatment included pain relief medications. Further management depended on the patient’s response.",646aefe2-cb87-47fa-811f-6819a33bdcad
23,discussion2,"  Almost all neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) children were referred to the Warsaw Hospice for Children (WHC) in a state of extreme malnutrition and cachexia. The child with the lowest body mass index (BMI) (9.8) died after 34 days. In the remaining patients with higher body mass index (BMI) values (11–14.3), a positive response to nutritional treatment was observed.  The TIRCON expert group recommendation against a ketogenic diet for all patients with pantothenate kinase associated with neurodegeneration (PKAN) [7] was based on the only published study which was conducted on mice [8]. Their results show that pantothenic acid prevents the negative effects of the ketogenic diet in pantothenate kinase associated with neurodegeneration (PKAN) mice. For that reason, the ketogenic diet used in 8 Warsaw Hospice for Children (WHC) patients contained large amounts of pantothenic acid (Table 7).",7fb7dbb6-8dfc-4b1c-b852-3e5186e63c6f

Our experiences are similar and prove the positive effects of this type of nutritional treatment. In our previous study, we demonstrated that the ketogenic (low-carbohydrate) diet in Warsaw Hospice for Children (WHC) patients is more beneficial than the industrial, high-carbohydrate diet because it reduces the risk of candidiasis and intestinal permeability [10].",358f2b05-cc2e-406f-86c3-43d1b074d4ac
25,discussion4,"  Respiratory rehabilitation is the second most important form of therapy necessary to avoid premature death of the patient. Its effectiveness increases with the use of the botulinum toxin (paraspinal muscle relaxation) and a cough assistor with the function of lung expansion (prevention and treatment of atelectasis of the lungs).  Symptomatic treatment in palliative care can be effectively carried out at home by a hospice team of adequately trained doctors, nurses, and physiotherapists. It is necessary to maintain close cooperation with a neurologist consultant and a center that conducts deep brain stimulation.  Home palliative care can be effectively carried out if parents or carers accept and respect the ethical principles, standards, and treatment procedures, and follow medical advice. Hospital admission of a child in a terminal phase is associated with the risk of harmful life-prolonging therapy.",456103dc-962f-4994-aea6-0088324778d8
26,discussion5," The end of life plan and do-not-resuscitate protocol should be established before the referral to a palliative care program [11].  Parents or carers who provide home-based palliative care often experience chronic stress and a range of mental, emotional, spiritual, physical, and financial problems. Hospice workers (i.e., psychologist, chaplain, social worker) should be able to recognize such problems and provide appropriate support. The parents of our patients rated highly the quality of home palliative care, which confirms its effectiveness.  Conclusions  The situation of children with early forms of pantothenate kinase associated with neurodegeneration (PKAN) and mitochondrial protein–associated neurodegeneration (MPAN) is particularly difficult because they cannot verbally communicate their suffering, despite being conscious and aware.  Home palliative care is the most effective form of treatment. Symptom control is possible at home and does not require intravenous therapy.",33110f3c-42b3-4a3d-96d0-cbd5d87bbd78
27,discussion6,"  In cases of parental action contrary to the child’s best interest, the hospice physician is obliged to notify the family court. The example of such situation is inappropriate nutrition leading to starvation, or oral feeding which may cause aspiration and death.  Children with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 11 may survive in response to nutritional therapy. Death from starvation occurs below this value. Lifespan depends on the response to nutritional treatment.  In the case of gastroesophageal reflux, antireflux surgery should be performed prior to the implantation of brain stimulators.
