0,methods0," Study design and approval  This prospective comparison study was undertaken to assess changes in morbidly obese patients in two groups, each undertaking a 2-week trial of a different diet before undergoing bariatric surgery. These diets are not routinely practiced in the clinic. This is not an interventional study. Patients were randomly assigned to diet types. The standard effect size was determined as 1.05 with 5% margin of error and 80% power for the sample size. It was found sufficient to include n = 14 cases in each group. According to this minimum number, 15 people were included in each group. The primary outcome used to base statistical power was body mass index. Forty-five morbidly obese patients were included in the study. At the beginning of the study before exclusion, 25 of these 45 patients were in the VLCKD-SDM group and 20 were in the MD group. After the excluded patients, the number of patients in each diet group fulfilled the numbers required for the sample size.",806f5b22-554f-4365-9752-3765369ed4a7
1,methods1," Nine patients failed to adhere to the diet and were therefore excluded from the study. Of these patients, 7 were in the VLCKD-SDM and 2 were in the MD group. Additionally, 6 patients had early surgery. Three of these belonged to the VLCKD-SDM group, and three to the MD group. Patients who failed to follow the diet and underwent surgery too soon were unable to finish the 14-day diet phase. They were left out of the study to avoid having a negative impact on the findings. The study was conducted with pre-approval of the hospital’s Non-invasive Clinical Research Ethics Committee (Decision No. 161, Approval #10840098-604.01.01-E.12049 and E-10840098-772.02-2490; dated 09.03.2016, 29.07.2016, 01.06.2021) and was performed in accord with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.

Diets  VLCKD-SDM  The very-low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group’s 2-week course consisted of meal replacements using Societa Dietetica Medica (SDM, Kalibra [VLCKD-SDM]) products. Patients were provided with 1–1.2 g/kg/day of protein based on each patient’s calculated ideal weight, 10–12 kcal/kg/day of energy (containing 30–40% fat) based on ideal weight. One portion of each product contained 16–18 g of protein (31 g, pasta, 20 g, focaccia), 60–224 kcal of energy, 0.1–12 g of fiber, and 0.9–9.6 g of fat.",65e0542c-1c94-486b-aba1-3bd9b66b0f3a
3,methods3," The respective protein content of the above products is composed of whey, egg, wheat, and pea protein. Products also contained important amino acids (i.e., leucine, lysine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and tryptophan) and sucralose approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) as a sweetener.  In addition, patients were instructed to drink 2–3 L of water a day. Individualized nutritional supplements were given under the supervision of the doctor12,13. These included: 1 tablet Supradyn All Day (Bayer Turkish Chemical Industry Trade Ltd., Turkey); 1 effervescent tablet of Kalinor (Farma-Tek Pharmaceutical Industry, and Trade Co.

Mediterranean diet  Based on an updated systematic review of the core compositional elements of a Mediterranean diet14, the study required patients in the MD group to consume 15–20% protein (low-fat dairy, poultry, fish, legumes, nuts, red meat) in their daily food intake, 45–50% carbohydrates (vegetables, fruits, whole grains), and 25–35% fat (especially from olive oil). In this MD, the daily minimum requirements of vitamins and minerals were expected to be included with the food and beverage selections; therefore, supplements were not added.  Diet follow-up  Demographic information, anthropometric and biochemical measurements, liver size, and gastrointestinal issues were assessed carefully before and after the diet. An interview was conducted at the hospital outpatient clinic to evaluate the nutritional status of the patients in detail on the 7th and the 15th days after the start of the study.",eb8ddd53-ea31-4f8e-92bb-a2d94217ceb3
5,methods5," Dietary compliance, ketones in urine, and any complications were assessed.  Determining food consumption status  The patients' required intake of energy and macronutrients for both diet groups was determined using a formula. Our ketogenic diet group was fed commercial products, therefore daily macronutrients were determined based on the information on the labels of the goods they consumed over the course of 14 days. A 24-h diary was kept by members of our Mediterranean diet group. Patients were instructed to record on a chart the foods and meals they consumed over the course of three days, one of which being a weekend. The amounts of all foods consumed were calculated using the units of g and kg. The portions of the stated contents were chosen based on standardised recipes15. Consumed foods and portion amounts of meals were one by one entered into the Nutrition Information System (BeBiS) database software programme.",8ac6aacf-9d25-47ce-9926-07d2f1b45feb
6,methods6," This software was used to compute the daily intake of energy, carbohydrate, fat, and micronutrients16.  Evaluation of nutritional status  Anthropometric measurements  body mass index (BMI) was calculated using ideal body mass index (BMI) (Ibody mass index (BMI)) and ideal body weight (ideal body weight (IBW)) formulas17,18. Weight loss (WL%)19 and basal metabolic rate (basal metabolic rate (BMR)) were calculated with the Schofield Equation20. Body fat percentage and lean body mass (lean body mass (LBM)) were calculated using standard formulas21. Waist, hip, and middle-upper arm circumference (middle upper arm circumference (MUAC)) measurements were taken. Waist Circumference was assessed at the midpoint between the 12th rib and the iliac crest, while hip circumference was measured at the level of the greater trochanter. Waist/hip ratio was calculated as WC/HC18,22. Malnutrition status was determined by the nutritional risk index (Nutritional Risk Index (NRI))23.",df4a5e4e-8150-4134-83d6-45660093b764

Adherence to the protein-rich diet was detected by the presence of ketones in the urine.",46ce92b3-84d6-4539-9e02-617e37ecaf0d
8,methods8,"  Liver size  The liver size of patients was measured by the same radiologist in both study groups by abdominal sonography just before starting the pre-operative diet and 2 weeks after when the diet period ended just before the surgery. Both measurement values were assessed by the surgical team. No liver measurements were made in the postoperative period. The measurement was accomplished according to the method described by Börner et al., by taking the mid-clavicular line in maximum inspiration and supine positions as reference by using a 2–5-MHz convex abdominal sonography probe. Reference value, mean male ≤ 150 ± 15 mm and female ≤ 149 ± 16 mm values were considered normal24.

Data normality was evaluated by visual inspection of histograms/Q–Q plots and cross-validated by the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. As appropriate, independent samples t-tests or Mann–Whitney U-tests were used to assess between-group differences with respect to quantitative baseline and outcome variables; chi-square tests (or Fisher's exact tests) were applied to qualitative data. Paired-samples t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (as appropriate) were used to analyze within-group change from baseline along quantitative variables; McNemar’s test was used for qualitative data.

11,results0," Between January 2016 and March 2017, 45 patients (25 in VLCKD-SDM, 20 in MD group) with morbid obesity between the ages of 18 and 65 years were enrolled in the General Surgery Department to undergo bariatric surgery. Nine patients (7 in VLCKD-SDM, 2 in MD group) could not adhere to the diet and 6 patients (3 in VLCKD-SDM, 3 in MD group) were operated on earlier than originally planned, excluding 15 patients from the study. Thus, the total study sample was 30 patients, 15 in the VLCKD-SDM group and 15 in the MD group. Each group consisted of 4 (26.7%) men and 11 (73.3%) women.

15,discussion0," The protective effects on the cardiovascular system of implementing a long-term Mediterranean diet have been well demonstrated. In the 1960s, Ancel Keys formally elaborated the characteristics of the MD25 as inclusive of monosaturated fats (especially from olive oil), vegetables and fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy consumed daily; poultry, fish, legumes and nuts consumer weekly; and modest consumption of red meat 2–3 times monthly. Epidemiological studies and clinical trials have reported the anti-metabolic syndrome effects and anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of implementing a MD26–28. More recently, VLCKDs, MDs, and other programs comprised of appropriate protein and energy levels have demonstrated statistically significant preoperative weight loss and improvement of anatomical access after short-term pre-bariatric surgery diets.",78475f4d-1d53-4201-96db-acb1a93ed899
16,discussion1,"  The literature reports an array of preoperative dietary program durations, ranging from 10 days through 20 weeks, and a variety of claims regarding the reduction of intraoperative risks, postoperative complications, operating room time, hospital stay, and improvement of comorbidities through preoperative dieting7,29. Our discussion herein focuses solely on comparisons of our findings with recent studies of diets of between 10 days and 12 weeks’ duration, and on changes in weight loss, liver size reduction, and metabolic parameters30–32. We believe the current study is the first to directly compare an MD with a VLCKD product for a duration of 2 weeks to identify which approach facilitated the most advantageous overall preoperative weight loss in patients with morbid obesity.",bb4e44ac-d2cc-4c6e-b93a-56e47504c79b
17,discussion2,"  The specific VLCKD in our study, VLCKD-SDM, contained n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), whey protein, and probiotic and vitamin/mineral supplements, and the MD was based on normal foods with carefully prescribed content and measures. It was comprised of an amount of protein similar to that of other VLCKDs, with a greater amount of fat3,29,33. The program consisted of industrial foods with whey protein, with a level of carbohydrate 17–29% higher than that of other VLCKDs and 18–20% lower than in other very low calorie diet (VLCD)s and LCDs. On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet we studied can only be discussed in the context of the Pro-MD product identified in the literature. The MD diet included protein and fat content that was 8–12% higher than that of Pro-MD9.  The short-term weight loss goal of 5–10% was thought to be safe and feasible. Patients on the VLCKD-SDM attained this goal fully; MD patients achieved 50.0% of this primary weight loss endpoint.",020a239a-1b6d-4a37-8c3b-69f0217bd8f6
18,discussion3," The VLCKD-SDM resulted in significantly greater decreases in low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) compared to the MD, and, significantly greater increases in vitamin B12 and D levels. VLCKD-SDM also achieved a greater reduction in median liver size (5.5% versus 1.7%). In our study, as in other studies, serum iron levels trended toward significant increases with the duration of diet therapy but remained within normal limits3. We did not assess the effect of the two diets on complications, as systematic reviews suggest that successful preoperative weight-loss diets do not necessarily confer protection against intraoperative risks or postoperative complications8.  Other presurgical diets are based predominantly on meal replacements consisting of whey-casein proteins with added micronutrients and macronutrients.",7a395586-80b3-4fae-afa5-ea143c279a5a

20,discussion5,"  Recent short-term presurgical studies, randomized trials, and a systematic review provide a basis for estimating the relative effectiveness of very low calorie diet (VLCD)s, industrial liquid formulations of very low calorie diet (VLCD)s, normal food-based very low calorie diet (VLCD)s, industrial liquid formulations of very low calorie diet (VLCD)s, a Protein-MD, and VLCKDs on weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, fat percentage, lean body mass, nutrient content, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)), and liver size2–12,14,27–39. As depicted in the reference Protein-MD and VLCKDs reviewed were equivalent to one another in achieving the greatest percentage fat loss and liver size reduction; VLCKDs were also most effective in increasing lean body mass. The reference Protein-MD resulted in the greatest weight loss and high density lipoprotein (HDL) reduction.",1c5f3298-43ec-41d5-ad0e-005b20713de4
21,discussion6," The reference VLCKD-SDMs were dominant in reducing body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Essential nutrients were most increased by the reference industrial liquid formulations very low calorie diet (VLCD)s; and triglycerides were most decreased by normal food based very low calorie diet (VLCD)s.  No nutritional supplements were administered since MD contains a significant amount of nutrients and is balanced and healthy. Vitamins and probiotics were added to the ketogenic commercial meals consumed in VLCKD-SDM as they lacked appropriate vitamin and fiber content. With the nutritional supplements given to the ketogenic diet group, it was made sure that the two diet groups in this study had comparable ratios of all macronutrients, with the exception of protein and carbohydrates.  The contents of the two meals were assessed for these nutritional supplements, but whether they were in the same quantities was not determined.",d3d0b0e5-1c4e-4a05-bb7c-d3f83e4d1284
22,discussion7," Although no calculations were conducted, it is believed that both groups' nutrients are relatively similar. The outcomes demonstrate this as well (Table 4). It was discovered that there were no statistically significant variations between these two diet groups' biochemical markers. In VLCKD-SDM, only vitamin B12 and vitamin D levels increased. This also has to do with supplements. High levels of vit B12 and D in VLCKD are thought to be related to supplementation. Patients on the MD diet did not receive vit D supplements according to the pre-diet blood levels of vit D. The impact on the biochemical outcomes might have been the same if MD had received B12 and vitamin D supplements in accordance with the levels of vitamin D in the blood. According to studies in the literature, patients' constipation and elevated ketone levels are caused by ketogenic industrial items. Based on these data, probiotic supplementation was administered.",2cfcd605-5483-41e3-aaec-f812eeefd068
23,discussion8," Fish eating is part of the healthy MD nutritional approach, hence was presented in MD. Patients with VLCKD-SDM were supplemented with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s since fish could not be provided to them. Potassium was given in studies with VLCKD. This was given because it was a consensus. To ensure that the nutritional profiles of the two groups were comparable, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation was given to the VLCKD-SDM group in this study. They were not supplied separately as supplements since it was believed that these nutrients were satisfied by natural meals in the MD group. Therefore, giving n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements to VLCKD-SDM does not completely neutralize this superiority of MD.  In relating current results to that of the reference diets in terms of duration, the mean weight loss attained by patients in the 2-week VLCKD-SDM (7.3 ± 2.3 kg, total weight loss [TWL] 5.",bc64a540-b876-4929-8c98-13b1747f8a85
24,discussion9,"7%) was reached only by the reference industrial liquid formulations very low calorie diet (VLCD)s and industrial liquid formulations of LCDs following 3–6 weeks. Weight loss achieved in the studied MD (3.4 ± 0.8 kg, TWL 2.6%) was approximately half that of the reference VLCKDs, more than half of the industrial liquid formulations very low calorie diet (VLCD)s and industrial liquid formulations of LCDs, and equivalent to the normal food-based very low calorie diet (VLCD)s and normal/industrial food-based LCDs.  The decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels was greater in VLCKD-SDM. Both total and VLCKD-SDM showed a positive correlation between post-diet high density lipoprotein (HDL) change and lean body mass (LBM) levels (i.e., as high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels decreased, lean body mass (LBM) levels also decreased, or vice versa) (Addendum Table 2).",bd4dc205-d5b3-4202-85a9-7196837ec6dd
25,discussion10," In the total group, a positive correlation was observed between post-diet high density lipoprotein (HDL) change and fat% and weight loss% (Addendum Table 1). It was observed that high density lipoprotein (HDL) decreased more with increasing weight loss, which is consistent with the literature3,6,40. As in the article, during the acute phase of weight loss, high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels fall as a result of a change in the activity of lecithin cholesterol ester transfer protein (lecithin cholesterol ester transfer protein (LCAT)), and when low body weight is stably maintained, high density lipoprotein (HDL) either rises to baseline levels or higher40. During weight loss therapy using very low calorie diet (VLCD)s, high density lipoprotein (HDL) initially decreases, but then either increases to baseline levels or results in an overall improvement in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels during weight maintenance3,6,40.",6b4b7641-64c4-4437-ae4e-08bdb97bca06
26,discussion11,"  Reference diets, as a group, appeared to reduce liver size by between 12 and 30%. A systematic review of preoperative diets showed that liver size decreased on average by 15% (range 5–20%), though not with low-energy diets8. The greatest reduction in liver size among the reference diets was in the Protein-MD group and VLCKD group between 2 and 3 weeks. In VLCKD studies, the occurrence of ketonuria and ketonemia is evidence of compliance with the diet, wherein a 1-unit increase in ketonuria increased TWL by 2.0%3,6,37. In this context, the greater weight loss seen in the studied VLCKD-SDM group versus the MD group was likely associated with a higher satiety level related to the development of ketones.  Limitations  Limitations of our study included a relatively low number of patients, the short-term nature of the study, and the difficulty of comparing the studied diets to other reported diets of varying durations.",2cb10ba0-703f-4c8b-8835-7f7a01c62034
27,discussion12," Dividing the VLCKD-SDM group into two subgroups (one containing added n-3, one without it) would have provided additional insight into the most effective form of this diet.  The limitations of the study include that nutrients were not calculated in the same ratios in both groups before the diet, and supplements were not administered to our MD group based on pre-diet serum vitamin-mineral levels. Further research should be conducted by administering supplements in the same ratio to both groups.  Conclusions  Ketogenic diets have higher protein and lower carbohydrate content than MDs, and for this reason may be the superior preoperative 2-week weight-loss diet. The MD appears to require a significantly longer period of time to achieve similar results. The MD facilitated 50.0% less weight loss than the VLCKD-SDM. However, if the VLCKD-SDM results in gastrointestinal side effects, the MD can be effectively employed.",111214e1-7859-4843-9f4e-b3fc9d65da02
28,discussion13,"  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to directly compare the preoperative effects of a VLCKD with a Mediterranean diet. The current findings showed that liver size was significantly decreased following both diets; however, the VLCKD-SDM, with its high whey protein content, sufficient pre-measured energy, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and a balance of macro and micro nutrients appeared significantly more effective than the Mediterranean diet in reducing weight prior to bariatric surgery.
