0,methods0," This is a retrospective study that explicitly examined the effects of DFAs on miRNA expression, published in the last ten years. The results of this review showed that the studies are diverse, and employed a wide array of methodologies. While some of the studies included interventions with only one type of fatty acid, others included more than one or many, combining either all types of DFAs, except for TFAs, or a single type of MUFA or PUFA. Moreover, some studies performed interventions in vivo and validated the results in ex vivo and in vitro models, while others only validated results in vivo. Despite the wide range of studies henceforth reviewed, the results were examined according to miRNAs that were particularly associated with metabolic disorders and inflammation. The data collected from the studies are summarized in Table 1 and discussed in detail below.  3. Results  3.1.",0c8150fb-914c-4b1b-b1b7-0b815ebc15b1
1,methods1," DFAs Alter miRNA Expression Associated with Metabolic Disorders  It has been reported that immortalized human hepatocytes treated with oleic acid-induced steatosis represent a valuable model for the study of genetic and functional factors involved in the process of lipid accumulation and liver injury [47]. Interestingly, phosphatase and tensin homolog (phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)) is a regulator of phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling and an important tumor suppressor mutated/deleted in human cancers. phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion in the liver leads to insulin resistance, steatosis, inflammation, and cancer. It has been recently demonstrated that unsaturated fatty acids trigger steatosis by down-regulating phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression in this model of hepatocytes via activation of a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) complex.",814deb3d-ea92-4a6a-bf49-d730c3cd5a2a
2,methods2," Additionally, unsaturated fatty acids upregulate the expression of miRNA-21, which binds to phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) messenger RNA 3′-untranslated region and induces its degradation, involved in the physiopathology of steatosis [36] (Figure 1A, Hepatocyte).  In another high-fat diet (high fat diet (HFD)) murine model, the expression in retroperitoneal adipose tissue of five miRNAs related to adipocyte differentiation (miR-143), lipid metabolism (miR-103 and 107), and obesity (miR-221 and 222), as well as the metabolic state of the animals, were modified in response to treatment with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (conjugated linoleic acids) at different doses.",ed3fca96-284c-4c56-bd0c-09c6be3da661
3,methods3," Furthermore, the same study showed that conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) treatments altered the expression levels of some adipogenic marker genes, such as glucose transporter type 4 (Glut4), lipoprotein lipase (lipoprotein lipase (LPL)), peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma 2 (PPARc2), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPa). Additionally, correlations between miRNAs and their genetic targets were found in adipocytes; at low dosage (3.0 or 10 mg conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)/animal for 37 days), miR-143 correlated positively with adiponectin and leptin expression; miR-103 correlated with two key markers of lipid metabolism, fatty acid synthase (fatty acid synthase (FASN)), and muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b (Cpt1b); miR-107 correlated with genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) and Cpt1b, as well as with C/EBPa; miR-222 showed a significant correlation with genes related to adipocyte metabolism (Glut4),",0975f31f-edcb-4fa1-a2b5-a49a3fb0ae26
4,methods4," lipolysis (hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 2 (Pnpla2)), lipogenesis (PPARc2, Fas, stearoyl-Coen-zyme A desaturase 1 (Scd1)), fatty acid oxidation (Ucp2), and adipocytokines, adiponectin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). miR-221 expression also correlated with TNF-α levels. Meanwhile, at high doses of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (3 or 10 mg conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)/animal for the first 30 days and 6 or 20 mg conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)/animal for the next 35 days), miR-107 expression in adipocytes was significantly correlated with lipoprotein lipase (LPL), PPARα, and TNF-α expression levels. Additionally, in animals fed both an high fat diet (HFD) and a normal fat diet, a significant correlation was observed between miR-107 and Cpt1b expression levels. However, in both high-fat feeding and normal-fat feeding, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) treatment maintained the correlation between miR-107 and Cpt1b expression.",30d3f768-d148-4923-9bd5-844a77abecdf
5,methods5," miR-221 also correlated positively with TNF-α and negatively with adiponectin in response to conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) treatment [41] (Figure 1A, Adipocyte).  Another animal model to evaluate the effects of fat intake on obesity conducted on Göttingen minipigs (Sus scrofa) demonstrated that the addition of 0.55% MUFAs and 6.86% PUFAs in a diet with lard for 11 weeks led to the downregulation of miR-122, but did not change the expression of cationic amino transport 1 (CAT1) in hepatocytes, which suggested that miR-122 was involved in obesity [38]. In another study, the expression of miR-467b and its direct target lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were evaluated in a mouse non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model and in vitro using the Hepa hepatocyte 1–6 cell line. The results showed that miR-467b expression was significantly downregulated in liver tissues of high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and steatosis-induced hepatocytes.",08e04888-0178-4aee-8275-4ea45126b3ba
6,methods6," This finding suggested that the downregulation of miR-467b expression was involved in the development of hepatic steatosis through the modulated expression of its target lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Moreover, the interaction between miR-467b and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene expression was associated with insulin resistance, a major cause of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [37] (Figure 1A, Hepatocyte).  In a long-term model of obesity, after animals were fed an high fat diet (HFD) for five months, the expression levels of miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-21, miR-146a, and miR-146b were induced, and miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-122, miR-133b, miR-1, miR-30a, miR-192, miR-193a-3p, and miR-30e expression levels were repressed in white adipose tissue. The validated miRNAs were associated with cell differentiation and metabolic processes related to the development of obesity [34].",8d441005-e479-49db-a86d-cafe04c24f0a
7,methods7," In another rat model, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was administered to a group of dyslipidemic cafeteria diet-fed male Wistar rats, and both liver tissues and PBMCs were examined for miR-122 and miR-33a expression, both regulators of lipid metabolism in the liver. After being fed an high fat diet (HFD) for ten weeks, both miR-122 and miR-33a expression levels were induced. PUFA treatment for the next three weeks repressed both miR-122 and miR-33a expression in the liver and even more so in PBMCs (Figure 1A, Hepatocyte and 1 B, Monocyte). Expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (Pparβ/ƍ), target genes for miR-122, and of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (cpt1a) and ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily A Member 1 (abca1), target genes for miR-33a, were consistent with these findings, and correlated with a state of lipemia [31].",f5b4d2f4-d99f-4304-92aa-5ea4b808e590
8,methods8,"  Another study assessed global changes in miRNA expression in beta cells in an obesity-associated T2D model. Animals were fed an high fat diet (HFD) for eight weeks with cholesterol and lard. First, miRNA profiling was performed in isolated pancreatic islets and then validated in vitro in primary rat and human beta cells. Interestingly, changes in miR-132, miR-184, and miR-338-3p expression levels were observed in pre-diabetic mice, which suggested that changes in miRNA expression occur before the development of the disease. Afterward, upregulation of miR-132 was associated with increased expression of MAF BZIP Transcription Factor A (Mafa), a gene that plays an important role in the control of beta cell function and survival (Figure 1B, Pancreatic B cell). The results indicated that insulin resistance and obesity triggered dysregulation in miRNA expression, which allowed beta cells to first adapt to disease and sustain cell function.",da17be18-0651-423e-b1e7-86f3d7105c5e
9,methods9," Later, gene expression was associated with the onset and manifestation of T2D, and finally with the demise of cells [35].  In a later study in cell lines, the authors assessed the beneficial effects of ω-3 long-chain fatty acids (FAs) in human hepatoma G2 (HepG2) and epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells. The results of the study indicated that the effects were exerted in part through the regulation of miRNA expression. The study demonstrated that different FA treatments result in different patterns of miRNA expression, involved both in lipid metabolism and cancer functions. Importantly, the differential miRNA expression depended on the type of FAs, but also on the pharmacological preparation of the treatment, such as micelles produced with oleic and palmitic acids, as well as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).",20d6e7b6-8000-4938-9a8d-3ddacbba3df7
10,methods10," In particular, miR-30c and miR-192 target genes related to lipid metabolism were characterized in transfection studies, and their function in gene expression was assessed. This study was one of the first to demonstrate that DFAs fine-tune gene expression regulation in a restrained and tissue-specific manner [39]. In a further study from the same research group, Caco-2 cells were treated with docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), conjugated linoleic acid (conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)), and cholesterol; the authors showed that miR-107 was differentially expressed by all treatments. The inhibition of miRNA-107 expression deregulates circadian rhythm and contributes to the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases, such as T2D and AScardiovascular disease (CVD) (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), thus representing a possible therapeutic target for these diseases [40].  The effects of PUFAs on miRNA expression were assessed in a healthy population.",e58fae94-a4cb-45ed-a95f-eac8c9ffabb7
11,methods11," The effect of DFAs in a PUFA-enriched diet, inferred from plasma fatty acid concentration, was linked to changes in circulating miRNAs. In the first experiment, 20 miRNAs were identified and differentially expressed in healthy women after consuming PUFAs in their diet. In a subsequent study, ten miRNAs were validated in both men and women in a larger group. Changes were seen in miRNA expression after eight weeks with daily walnut and almond intake [42]. In particular, miR-221 and C reactive protein (CRP) (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) expressions were repressed after treatment with PUFAs.  In another study performed in a healthy population, the effects of a single dose of extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) were detected after four hours of intake. extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a complex nutrient mix composed primarily of MUFAs (65.2%–80.8%). Other components include PUFAs (7.0–15.",b2d3965f-7389-4929-be02-161db7625d90
12,methods12,"5%), tocopherols, squalene, pigments, and other compounds, such as phenolic compounds, triterpene dialcohols, and B-sitosterol [49]. Fourteen miRNAs were differentially modified, and seven were validated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The validated miRNAs have potentially beneficial effects on insulin resistance (i.e., miR-107), inflammation (i.e., miR-181b-5p, miR-23b-3p), and cancer (miR-19a-3p, miR-519b-3p), and may play an important role in preventing the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer [44].  A recent study aimed to analyze the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) in brown adipose tissue (brown adipose tissue (BAT)) thermogenesis, which represents a target to promote weight loss in obesity. The effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) treatment in mice after twelve weeks was analyzed in murine inguinal white and brown adipose tissue to demonstrate how brown fat and muscle cooperate to maintain normal body temperature.",d358697a-61cb-4244-91b0-34bfda5f7831
13,methods13," It has been shown that brown adipose tissue (BAT) can be stimulated to increase energy expenditure, and hence offers new therapeutic opportunities in obesity [50]. The study reported that treatment with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) increased oxygen consumption, but, importantly, modulated free fatty acid receptor 4 (Ffar 4), a functional receptor for ω-3 PUFAs, which enhanced brown adipogenesis through the upregulation of miR-30b and miR-378, and activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) [32] (Figure 1A, Adipocyte). In another study, both an high fat diet (HFD) administered to mice for 14 weeks and palmitate treatment in HepG2 cells induced miR-96 expression in the liver of the mice and the cells; miR-96 directly targeted insulin receptor (insulin receptor (INSR)) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and repressed gene expression post-transcriptionally.",96908f35-b8cf-4206-a248-db077927c875
14,methods14," Additionally, the liver of high fat diet (HFD) fed mice and the treated hepatocytes exhibited impairment of insulin-signaling and glycogen synthesis, revealing miR-96 as a promoter of hepatic insulin resistance pathogenesis in obese states [45] (Figure 1A, Hepatocyte).  Although the consumption of high quantities of TFAs associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and a decrease in HDL has been well-established, the effect of ruminant TFAs (rTFA, naturally occurring in ruminant meat and milk fat) on metabolic markers was reported until only recently. The next study analyzed the HDL-carried miRNA expression of two of the most abundant HDL-carried miRNAs found in plasma.",84e46532-8902-4cf3-afe8-beda4e32c1da
15,methods15," After nine men were given a diet high in either industrial TFAs (iTFAs, produced industrially by partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils), or rTFAs, designed in a previous study that measured the effect of rTFAs on metabolic markers [51], miRNA expression was measured in blood plasma: miR-223-3p concentrations correlated negatively with HDL levels after a diet high in iTFAs, and positively with C-reactive protein levels after a diet high in rTFAs. Conversely, miR-135-3p concentrations correlated positively with both total triglyceride levels after a diet high in iTFAs, and with low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels after a diet high in rTFAs. The results suggest that diets high in TFAs, whether of industrial or ruminant origin, alter HDL-carried miRNA concentrations, and are associated with changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors [13].",62b490d1-b9d6-4431-856e-241c2588fdd6
16,methods16," One year later, in a similar study model, the same group analyzed whether diets with different concentrations of iTFAs or rTFAs modify contributions of HDL-carried miRNAs associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) to the plasmatic pool. HDL-carried miR-103a-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-222-3p, miR-376c-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-30a-5p, miR-328-3p, miR-423-3p, miR-124-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-31-5p, miR-375, and miR-133a-3p varied in contribution to the plasmatic pool after diets high in iTFAS and rTFAs were given. The results showed that diets high in TFAs modify the HDL-carried miRNA profile, contribute differently to the plasmatic pool, and suggest that these miRNAs may be involved in the regulation of cardioprotective HDL functions [16].  In another non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model, the effect of fish oil on miRNA expression in rat liver tissue was analyzed. Animals were either fed a diet rich in lard alone or supplemented with fish oil.",ebfbce2e-19fd-4142-81d8-482321cf1341
17,methods17," The results from sequencing identified 79 miRNAs as differentially expressed in the group supplemented with fish oil compared to the control group. Importantly, the repressed expression of rno-miR-29c target-regulated the expression of Period Circadian Regulator 3 (Per3), a critical circadian rhythm gene associated with obesity and diabetes; rno-miR-328 expression was induced, as well as target-regulated Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (Pcsk9), a gene that plays a crucial role in low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor degradation and cholesterol metabolism. Finally, miR-30d expression was induced, and in turn regulated the expression of its target Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 (Socs1), a gene involved in immunity and insulin and leptin signaling, respectively [33].  Finally, in an in vitro non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model, HepG2 cells treated with free fatty acids (palmitic and oleic acids, 1:2) resulted in miR-26a repressed endogenous expression.",a879e825-3fd2-4094-93f6-c8230820b121
18,methods18," Additionally, miR-26a overexpressed in cells induced a protective role on lipid metabolism and the progression of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [46] (Figure 1A, Hepatocyte).  The results of these studies also demonstrated that miRNA expression is modified by DFA intervention, which in turn regulates genes involved with obesity, non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and other metabolic diseases. Interventions with unsaturated FAs seem to have a beneficial effect on metabolism, while the opposite seems to occur with SFAs and TFAs.  3.2. DFAs Alter miRNA Expression Associated with Inflammation  The consumption of DFAs has traditionally been associated with inflammation, with the inflammatory response depending on the amount and type of DFAs consumed.",ea68a1ad-ceaf-45b4-b802-38e39226de68
19,methods19," However, controversy exists, as recent studies have also demonstrated that high fat and ketogenic diets with SFAs do not increase serum saturated fat content in humans and are not associated with increased inflammation [52]. In previous studies, it was reported that meals high in fat content promote translocation of endotoxins, mainly lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) produced by the gut microbiome, into the bloodstream. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates the inflammatory response, which may be both acute and chronic. SFAs may also induce inflammation by mimicking the actions of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [53]. Firstly, SFAs are an essential structural component of bacterial endotoxins [54]. Additionally, DFAs can promote endotoxin absorption [55].",c7b86b98-d4e0-4de6-b6e9-649b15648d99
20,methods20," Lastly, pro-inflammatory compounds in food may be absorbed, and prompt the inflammatory response directly by stimulating Toll-like receptors [56] found on cells of the innate immune system that lead to NF-kB activation and proinflammatory cytokine expression [57,58]. It has also been reported that, as postprandial lipemia is strongly correlated to endotoxin absorption, the addition of PUFAs and MFAs in the diet reduces lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pro-inflammatory activity [53,59]. Diets high in SFAs have been shown to promote metabolic endotoxemia not only through changes in the microbiome and bacterial end products, but also in altering intestinal physiology and barrier function and enterohepatic circulation of bile [60].  In an inflammation rat model, animals were fed rat chow with added lard and corn oil, low in ω-3 PUFAs, to induce inflammation and mimic the common human diet.",fe37b1f7-620f-4e7c-b250-992c09df29be
21,methods21," After the animals were divided into three groups, each group was either treated with ω-3 PUFAs, ω-6 PUFAs, or saline solution for 16 weeks. In the ω-3 treated rats, cluster of differentiation 8 T cells (CD8+ T) often and Treg populations significantly increased, and interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)), and TNF-α expression levels decreased. This suggests that the ω-3 treated group was better able to reduce inflammation related to a diet low in ω-3. The opposite resulted in the ω-6 treated group. Moreover, obesity and a reduction in omental fat in the ω-3 treated group were significantly lower compared to controls. Later, miRNA expression was analyzed in serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), white adipose tissue, and hepatocytes.",c4f6f4da-aaa5-4cc3-ab16-948f7ed48077
22,methods22," Importantly, in the ω-3 treated group, miR-146b-5p (directly targets TNF and is involved in TLR (Toll-like receptor) and TCR (T cell receptor) pathways) expression was significantly upregulated in serum compared to controls. While miR-19b-3p (directly targets phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and is involved in cell cycle and MAPK pathways) and miR-183-5p (directly targets phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and TNF and involved in MAPK pathways) expression levels in the ω-3 treated group were significantly upregulated in serum and PBMCs compared to controls. In the ω-3 treated group, miR-29c and miR-292-3p expression levels were upregulated in serum compared to controls, although not significantly. The results demonstrated that the expression levels for these miRNAs were regulated by PUFAs in the diet [43].",983acb40-5250-438c-9f5b-465e76ece335
23,methods23," Altogether, these findings suggest that certain DFAs in the diet are capable of modulating miRNA expression related to increased inflammation and obesity, whereas PUFAs in the diet, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), seem to do the opposite.  4. Conclusions  The overall data reported in this review indicate that DFAs play key roles in lipid metabolism by modulating miRNA expression. Importantly, both unsaturated fatty acids and SFAs may exert positive or negative effects in different cell types and organisms, both in vivo and in vitro, depending on varying combinations of DFAs, doses, and the duration of treatment. Notably, DFAs modulated miRNA expression related to metabolic parameters in human serum in both healthy individuals and patients with metabolic syndrome in as little as four hours [44].",3d8d47a2-bc27-40cc-a16e-8066cd0706d7
24,methods24," Other data showed that DFAs modulated miRNA expression prior to the onset of disease [35], suggesting that miRNAs prime cells long before metabolic dysfunction, thus emphasizing the importance of miRNAs both as regulators of metabolism and possible therapeutic targets. However, studies are heterogeneous and limited concerning methodologies and models. Nevertheless, the published novel findings hold promise for the treatment of human metabolic disease and to maintain health by DFA interventions. Notwithstanding, further studies are needed that incorporate molecular approaches and biological systems together with omics technologies to add evidence to the reported data and advance therapeutic strategies in human health and disease.
