0,introduction0,"Molecular targets for pediatric epilepsy treatment have largely centered on voltage‐gated sodium and calcium channels. The recent introduction of Perampanel (Perampanel (PER)), a non‐competitive amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (anti‐α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)R) antagonist, has introduced the concept of anti‐α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)R modulation as an effective anticonvulsant strategy. 1 ,  2  Similarly, recent studies in epilepsy rodent models have demonstrated the anti‐epileptic action of decanoic acid (decanoic acid (DEC)), a major medium‐chain fatty acid provided in the medium‐chain triglyceride (medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)) ketogenic diet (KD), is mediated through direct and selective inhibition of anti‐α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)Rs.",52723def-a6f9-4074-8b80-6e71b4e37ebb
1,introduction1," 3 ,  4    Human tissue samples provide a valuable tool for pre‐clinical drug screening and mechanism‐of‐action epilepsy studies. 5  This is particularly useful in pediatrics, where few anticonvulsant drug trials include children and adult study results are often extrapolated to children with pediatricians prescribing “off‐label”. 6  In most human brain tissue preparations, epileptiform activity is induced through manipulation of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) magnesium or potassium or by adding pro‐convulsant agents (e.g. 4‐aminopyridine). 7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10  We have found pediatric human brain tissue to be hyperexcitable and have recorded spontaneous epileptic activity. We show that antagonism of anti‐α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)R has a profound anticonvulsant effect in tissue derived from a spectrum of difficult‐to‐treat seizure syndromes.

11,results6,"  Since inhibitory interneurons are subject to glutamatergic drive, any change in anti‐α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)R activity is likely to depress gamma‐aminobutyric acid (gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA)) release and, indeed, we have seen this in recordings where Perampanel (PER) is applied. It seems unlikely, however, that decanoic acid (DEC) would have any direct effect on gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) release. To investigate the actions of decanoic acid (DEC) on isolated inhibitory synaptic currents, we used whole‐cell patch electrodes filled with the ionotropic glutamate receptor channel blocker, IEM‐1460, at 1.5 mmol/L.

15,discussion0,"This study confirms that anti‐α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)R inhibition, either by decanoic acid (DEC) or Perampanel (PER), is effective in abolishing spontaneous epileptiform activity in human tissue from drug‐resistant pediatric epilepsy patients through a direct reduction in excitatory neurotransmission.  decanoic acid (DEC), a major constituent of the medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT) KD, has previously been shown to have an anticonvulsant action in acute in vitro rat hippocampal slice models of epileptiform activity, acting through modulation of excitatory neurotransmission. 3 ,  4 ,  5  In our human tissue Local field potential (LFP) recordings, the anticonvulsant effects of decanoic acid (DEC) were clearly demonstrated at the 300 µmol/L concentration, consistent with reported therapeutic pediatric plasma concentrations.",0c3f1609-3cba-459e-a97e-46a0ba9e756d

Similar effects were seen with Perampanel (PER), via a reduction in the frequency of EPSCs and overall charge transfer.

17,discussion2," Like many aspects of epilepsy, it is not a simple case of ‘too much’ anti‐α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)R activity leading to seizures, for example, in anti‐anti‐α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)R autoimmune encephalitis, antibodies generated against anti‐α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)R epitopes lead to anti‐α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)R internalization, thereby reducing excitatory drive while still causing temporal lobe seizures in man. 16 ,  17  Similarly, recent work in a rat model of chronic TLE in our laboratory suggests that seizures induce a profound loss of anti‐α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)R expression in vulnerable networks. 12  Hence, anti‐α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)Rs would appear to play both causative and compensatory roles in seizures and epileptogenesis.",3e151618-e243-488a-98c1-f88a2538194c

Researchers have attempted to explore the role of the KD in improving seizure outcomes in epilepsy surgery patients with Focal Cortical Dysplasia Type II (the EDIBLE research study: www.edible.org.uk). While studies in human brain tissue do not provide a substitute for clinical trials in children, this preclinical study suggests that the medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT) KD or Perampanel (PER) may be effective in reducing seizure burden pre‐operatively for these patients. Indeed, a synergistic therapeutic effect of decanoic acid (DEC) and Perampanel (PER) was recently demonstrated in a study using in vitro epilepsy animal models and adult human tissue from brain tumor patients. 4    One criticism of human epileptic tissue research is the lack of “control” tissue.",837011c9-2187-46d6-a01f-93075c5980cc

However, this should not prevent the use of human tissue as an invaluable resource to study the true pathophysiological changes in pediatric drug‐resistant epilepsy. Recent studies in human brain tissue have demonstrated the presence of extensive species‐specific differences in neuron types and properties as compared to the rodent brain. 20 ,  21  A clear example of this is the expression of 5HT3 receptors, which are present on excitatory cells throughout the human forebrain, but expressed only on inhibitory gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) cells in rodent brain. 22  Therefore, the use of human epileptic brain tissue could provide novel insights to complement preclinical animal model studies.",655057f2-a38e-4c30-948c-6e6933ebb298
20,discussion5," This is of the particular importance of the testing of treatments in medically refractory epilepsy, as few animal models recapitulate fully the diversity of seizure types, localization and etiology of the patients seen in the clinic. In pediatric epilepsy research, slice preparations from resected tissue are extremely valuable and rare, and provide a unique substrate for testing novel and approved compounds in pharmacoresistant epilepsy.  In summary, this study shows the potential application of human tissue samples for epilepsy research and drug development. The heterogeneity of the human tissue samples is a true reflection of the variable etiology of refractory epilepsy and should be considered a strength of the human tissue approach to pediatric epilepsy research.
