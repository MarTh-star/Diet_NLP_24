Animals All animal procedures were approved by the Experimental Animal Care and Use Committee of East China Normal University (M20170316, Shanghai, China) and conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication, 8th edition, 2011). Three-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Company (SLAC, Shanghai, China). Mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free animal facility with a temperature-regulated fashion (22°C ± 2°C) on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Mice had free access to pure water and fed with chow diet, high-fat diet, or ketogenic diet. Body weight and the water and food intake were measured once a week throughout the intervention until the end of experiment [30].  2.2. Type 2 Diabetic Mouse Model and Interventions Three-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were used for inducing type 2 diabetes.",67892469-0d36-4d7b-a946-9ad1f1ba5210
1,methods1," Mice were fed a high-fat diet (SLAC) for 4 weeks and then were given streptozotocin (streptozotocin (STZ), Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 100 mg/kg in freshly prepared sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.4–4.5) [31]. An injection of sodium citrate buffer alone served as a control. The fast blood glucose level of mice was measured once a week using the blood from the tail vein and glucose monitor (ACCU-CHEK Active, Roche Basel, Switzerland). After streptozotocin (STZ) injection, mice with a fasting blood glucose level higher than 11.1 mmol/L on 3 consecutive weeks were considered as type 2 diabetic mice and divided into 3 subgroups, diabetic group (diabetes control) receiving high-fat diet, diabetes + KD group, and diabetes + KD + AE (aerobic exercise training) group receiving a ketogenic diet. The ingredient composition of all diet fed to mice was listed in Supplementary Table 1.  2.3.",576bf5fd-7038-4afb-9bc1-62c43bf30e38
2,methods2," Exercise Performance Test and Exercise Training Protocol The mice from diabetes + KD + AE group were placed on a motor-driven rodent treadmill (ZH-PT, Hangzhou, China). After an adaptation of treadmill, mice were subjected to an exercise performance test. First, mice warmed up at a speed of 8 m/min for 5 minutes, and then speed was increased by steps of 2 m/min every 2 min until the mice were unable or unwilling to carry on despite mild stimulation with a wooden cane. Performance tests were carried out at the beginning and 4 weeks later of training in order to readjust training intensity.  Aerobic exercise protocols were adapted from previous works described by Hafstad et al. [32], with the following modifications. For exercise acclimatization, all mice were conditioned at a speed of 8 m/min, 10 min/day, for 5 days to be familiar with the treadmill environment.",bb01de15-2283-4220-97db-5b56a4f2680a
3,methods3," After this period, mice ran for 60 min at intensity of 50–60% (0% slope) with the maximum speed reached during the last exercise performance test. Exercise animal group were exposed to 8 weeks of training consisting of treadmill running 5 days per week, while the sedentary animal group stayed in their home cage throughout the course of the experiment. The room temperature was maintained at 22 ± 2°C during the training sessions. After 8 weeks of training, animals were fasted overnight and sacrificed before tissues were harvested.  2.4. Glucose Tolerance Test and Insulin Tolerance Test GTT (intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test) and ITT (intraperitoneal Insulin tolerance test) were performed in vivo at the end of the 6-week exercise training period.",496bc8a6-52aa-4718-922c-d17e14b1e2b1
4,methods4," After overnight fasting or 4 hours, venous blood was collected from the tail for measurement of baseline glucose level at t = 0 min, and then at t = 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min after an intraperitoneal injection of glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) 1 g/kg body weight or insulin (Novolin R; Novo Nordisk) 0.75 U/kg body weight, blood glucose was measured using ACCU-CHEK Active.  2.5. Blood and Serum Assays Whole blood was collected in EDTA coated tubes for HbA1c analysis with a glycosylated hemoglobin assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). Serum glucose, TG, TC, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) were measured with commercially available assays purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute. Serum insulin was measured with Ultra-Sensitive Mouse INS ELISA Kit (CUSABIO, Wuhan, China). All assays were completed according to the manufacturers' guidelines.  2.6.",4a9a5014-af1c-4c55-a786-3e6c1ab20789

Liver Histopathology Mice were sacrificed and perfused with saline via a portal vein to remove the blood. Then, liver tissues from all mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer sections were obtained using a microtome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin staining (ZSBG-BIO, Beijing, China) in accordance with the instructions. For oil red O staining, liver tissues that had been fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde were dehydrated in 20% and 30% sucrose solutions and embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (SAKURA, Tokyo, Japan).",393a4b43-b1db-4deb-af54-964e728cd24d

RNA Extraction and Real-Time PCR Total RNA was extracted from pulverized liver using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by cDNA preparation from 1 ug of total RNA with a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Takara, Japan). cDNA products were quantified by real-time PCR using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Thermo, USA) on a StepOne Software v2.1 System (Applied Biosystems). We calculated mRNA using a 2∧deltaCT relative to the average of the β-actin expression. Detail of primers was listed in the Supplemental Table 2.  2.9.",dcda4f3c-12fe-4c87-9e27-fb839ab8c768
7,methods7," Western Blotting Protein expression was measured in mice liver by Western blotting with antibodies obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (activated protein kinase (AMPK)α, P-activated protein kinase (AMPK)αThr172) or from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (PPARα, PPARγ, β-actin) and Arigo (Anti-Rabbit IgG, Anti-Mouse IgG). Briefly, protein concentrations of total homogenate were determined by the Bradford method, and equivalent amounts of protein (20–40 μg) were loaded into each lane of the SDS-PAGE gel (6–12%). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to 0.4 μM PVDF membranes and stained with the Ponceau stain (0.1% wt/vol Ponceau Red in 5% acetic acid) to visualize protein loading. Membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 (1 ∗ TBST) and blocked for nonspecific binding room temperature (RT), 0.75–2 h, 5% (wt/vol) nonfat milk or BSA in TBST. Membranes were probed with primary antibodies for overnight at 4°C.",b98053fa-9618-4adb-b7b4-43f2c2d4a067
8,methods8," After 3 times washing, the PVDF membranes were incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Protein bands were quantified using FluorChem FC2 system (Alpha, Germany).  2.10. Quantification and Statistical Analysis Results were analyzed using Student's t-test or ANOVA where appropriate, using GraphPad Prism software. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used for all body weight plots, GTT and ITT data. A Bonferroni's post hoc test was used to test for significant differences as determined by the ANOVA. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.  3. Results 3.1. Ketogenic Diet and Ketogenic Diet Combined with Exercise Reduce Body Weights by Decreasing Food and Water Intake The changes in body weight during the 6-week period of aerobic exercise and the final body weights are displayed in Figures 1(a) and 1(b).",d3eb8d10-28ba-47ec-9cc0-9826e9192cd2
9,methods9," No significant differences were found in the baseline body weight of the three groups, while the body weight of the diabetes + KD group (from the 5th week till the end) and diabetes + KD + AE group (from the 2nd week till the end) was significantly lower than that of the diabetes group. Interestingly, mice treated with ketogenic diet with or without exercise both have lower food and water intake, compared with the diabetes group (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)), suggesting that the decrease in body weights by ketogenic diet intervention is due to reduced energy intake.  3.2. Ketogenic Diet and Ketogenic Diet Combined with Exercise Improve Insulin Sensitivity To determine the effect of ketogenic diet and ketogenic diet combined with exercise on glycemic control in diabetic mice, we traced the dynamic metabolic parameters of each mouse. Compared with the diabetes group, fasting blood glucose levels in the diabetes + KD and diabetes + KD + AE groups were significantly decreased (Figure 2(a)).",bb03eb2f-93df-442f-b859-96492857ff50
10,methods10," In addition, intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance test were performed at the end of the 6-week experimental period. As expected, insulin sensitivity was improved significantly in the diabetes + KD and diabetes + KD + AE groups, compared with the diabetes group, as shown by GTT and ITT (Figures 2(b) and 2(c)). Furthermore, blood glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and serum glucose and insulin levels were also reduced significantly in mice treated with ketogenic diet and ketogenic diet (Figures 2(d)–2(f)). HOMA-IR is an indicator of insulin resistance. Thus, we calculate the HOMA-IR and found that the HOMA-IR indexes were significantly greater in diabetes than in diabetes + KD and diabetes + KD + AE groups (Figure 2(g)). Taken together, both ketogenic diet and ketogenic diet combined with exercise could improve insulin sensitivity and serum glucose parameters.  3.3.",42e3bb26-c365-413f-bcf6-c7fdf8db2b6c
11,methods11," Ketogenic Diet and Ketogenic Diet Combined with Exercise Attenuate Hepatic Gluconeogenesis of Diabetic Mice Our results showed that both ketogenic diet intervention and combination with aerobic exercise could improve glycemic control, while the mechanism by which factors regulate blood glucose homeostasis is not known. Liver gluconeogenesis is critical for maintaining stable blood glucose. Thus, we tested whether ketogenic diet with or without exercise may modulate gluconeogenic gene programs in livers of diabetic mice. G6PC, PCK1, and FBPase are critical rate-limiting enzyme of gluconeogenesis. We found that ketogenic diet and ketogenic diet combination with aerobic exercise significantly decreased the G6PC, PCK1, and FBPase levels in the liver (Figures 3(a)–3(c)).",2a3beda0-a571-492d-8343-2a5563666b54
12,methods12," In addition, the activity of hepatic G6PC (Figure 3(d)) and PCK1 (Figure 3(e)) was slightly increased by ketogenic diet, while the activity of hepatic PCK1 was significantly suppressed by the combination intervention (Figure 3(e)). Thus, our data suggested that ketogenic diet and exercise could attenuate hepatic gluconeogenesis for improvements in glycemic control.  3.4. Aerobic Exercise Training Ameliorates Ketogenic Diet-Induced Metabolic Complications Although ketogenic diet intervention is effective in reducing body weights and controlling glucose homeostasis, it showed lipid metabolic disorders after 6-week intervention. We found that ketogenic diet treated mice had significantly higher serum ALT, TC, and TG (Figures 4(a), 4(c), and 4(d)) compared with diabetes mice. However, the combination of ketogenic diets and exercise largely improved the impaired serum parameters caused by single treatment of ketogenic diets, such as serum ALT and TG (Figures 4(a) and 4(d)).",adefbc0b-3067-4ba5-b315-970fdfdd31d1
13,methods13,"  Ketogenic diets were reported to cause hepatic steatosis due to lipid dysregulation. We thus determined hepatic steatosis using biochemical analysis and morphological staining. The diabetes + KD group had more liver TG, NEFA, and HDL-c (Figures 4(e)–4(g)) as well as liver weight (Figure 4(h)) than the diabetes group, while the results of mice epididymal adipose tissue weight were different (Figure 4(i)). However, 6 weeks of aerobic exercise training largely attenuated hepatic steatosis in comparison with diabetes + KD as shown by liver biochemical parameters (Figure 5(a)), reduced fat droplets, and steatotic scores (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). These results suggested that the combination of ketogenic diets and exercise largely reversed the adverse effects in lipid disorders and hepatic steatosis caused by single treatment of ketogenic diets.  3.5.",dce03448-4831-4044-97de-b6cb66025d0a
14,methods14," Aerobic Exercise Modulates PPARα and PPARγ Gene and Protein Programs in the Liver Next, we sought to determine the molecular mechanism to underneath the phenotype, since PPARs are critical for lipid metabolism in the liver. Specifically, PPARγ controls lipid storage and PPARα regulates β-oxidation. Thus, at the molecular level, we examined the expressions of PPARs and their downstream metabolic genes in mouse livers by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and found that PPARγ and its target genes, including ACC1, ACC2, FAS, SCD1, and SREBP1-C, were significantly higher in diabetes + KD mice while attenuated in the combination of KD and exercise (Figures 6(a)–6(f)). In addition, PPARα and its β-oxidative target genes, such as Scad and Acox1, were significantly lower in diabetes + KD mice and the effects were lost by aerobic exercise in mice liver (Figures 6(h)–6(k)).",0c6f263d-115f-43ee-b9c1-235214b6a3d5
15,methods15," Besides, we also observed that the liver Glut2 mRNA expression was reduced in KD and KD + AE groups, which suggested improved glycemic control in diabetic mice (Figure 6(l)). FGF21 promotes lipid catabolism, ketogenesis, and gluconeogenesis and improves insulin sensitivity and is an important target gene of PPARα in the liver [34, 35]. We found that FGF21 levels were highly expressed in KD group and further elevated in KD + AE group, suggesting that elevated FGF21 levels may be responsible for the beneficial effects of AE in combination with KD (Figure 6(k)). Furthermore, the protein levels of key regulators of lipid and glucose metabolism were consistent with their mRNA levels (Figures 7(a)–7(f)).  activated protein kinase (AMPK) is another key metabolic regulator in hepatocytes.",9cf45bbf-0f38-4f96-81b3-10298322d372
16,methods16," We found that P-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels exhibited similar change pattern as PPARα did (Supplementary Figure 1), suggesting that exercise prevented ketogenic diets induced lipid disorders by decreasing lipid storage via PPARγ, while increasing lipid β-oxidation via PPARα and activated protein kinase (AMPK).  4. Discussion Previous studies show that ketogenic diet has benefits on diabetes and might be used as a method of insulin resistance in diabetes. In this study, we demonstrate that the combination of ketogenic diet and aerobic exercise could improve glycemic control, while alleviating adverse effect of hepatic steatosis [36]. Furthermore, we found that after six weeks of intervention, mice treated with ketogenic diet and ketogenic diet combined with aerobic exercise both have lower body weights, HbAlc level, HOMA index, and higher insulin sensitivity [18, 21, 37, 38], compared with diabetes control group.",5ac4ff57-8863-4614-b864-e6c3f71515a8
17,methods17," However, our results also show that mice randomly assigned to the ketogenic diet had a variety of adverse effects including higher total cholesterol, triglycerides, and serum ALT and AST, compared to those of diabetes control group, where it can be largely reversed by aerobic exercise training [27, 29, 39]. Therefore, our data suggested that aerobic exercise combined with ketogenic diet may be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes.  Almost a century has passed since the ketogenic diet was initially used in treatment of diseases, and advanced therapies based on ketogenic diets are now available for diabetes [40]. Previous studies have been concluded that restriction of dietary carbohydrates results in positive effects on metabolic and cardiovascular parameters [38, 41, 42].",0110645b-7a77-4c95-a0ed-e4ed09bde9e1
18,methods18," The classic ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that induces ketone body production through fat metabolism with the goal of mimicking a fasting state in the body's tissues, shifting the predominant caloric source from carbohydrate to fat. This diet was used for a variety of health-related effects. Previous studies have reported that the ketogenic diet contributed to weight loss in diet-induced obese patients as well as improving glycemic control and metabolic parameters in diabetes. For instance, a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet not only reduced blood glucose levels close to normal but also stabilized islet size and the number of β cells in diabetic rats [19, 21]. However, the potential side effects of a ketogenic diet are also cause for concern such as hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis [24, 25, 43].",9c607643-0e52-4e9b-9a6c-37f8751ab339
19,methods19," In our study, we found that the hepatic steatosis was alleviated after combined ketogenic diet with aerobic exercise training, which could be a novel strategy for treating diabetes.  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) is considered the most common hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome affecting up to one-third of the adult population in affluent nations, and most obese individuals [44]. In China, approximately 20% of adults in the general population have Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Bland steatosis is considered to have a relatively benign prognosis as far as liver-related outcomes are concerned; those with steatohepatitis can progress to cirrhosis and its complications, including liver cancer [27].",be403ae6-958f-4bee-812e-7f5dc724798d
20,methods20," Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) were master lipid-activated transcription factors that play a key role in the regulation of lipid metabolism in liver, which belong to a class of nuclear receptors, because of their key role in the transcriptional regulation of mediators of glucose and lipid metabolism [45]. PPARs activate DNA transcription by binding to a relatively conserved DNA sequence in the vicinity of target genes. The group of PPARs consists of three distinct subtypes that differ in their expression profile across tissues and in their ligand specificity: PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ.  In the liver, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) functions at the master regulator of lipid metabolism, especially during fasting, by activating processes such as fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, fatty acid uptake, and triglyceride metabolism and storage [33].",5f1c7a00-62df-4f4f-845f-fa838b0493f2
21,methods21," The beneficial effects of PPARα for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/NASH have been proven in several mouse models by the treatments of high-fat diet and trans-fat-rich diet. PPARα null mice will develop a severe hepatic steatosis [46]. By encouraging flux through beta-oxidation and ketogenesis, PPARα signaling limits the hepatic accumulation of lipids. This prevents hepatic oxidative stress that results from the generation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation products in response to excess hepatic lipid accumulation [47]. And, under periods of food deprivation, PPARα promotes hepatic glucose and ketone production and prevents lipotoxicity. On the other hand, PPARγ is a nutrition-induced factor in both adipogenesis and hepatic steatosis [48]. The expression of PPARγ is induced in response to overnutrition in the liver. Furthermore, hepatocyte-specific PPARγ expression is positively associated with fatty liver in mouse models [49].",ba0ac778-7994-438a-986c-64ddd0f6e86d
22,methods22," For instance, overexpression of PPARγ leads to hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte-specific knockout of PPARγ reduces hepatic fat content in HFD-fed mice [50]. In this study, we found that aerobic exercise combined with ketogenic diet treatment could reduce the expressions of hepatic PPARγ and its target genes including SREBP-1C, ACC1, SCD-1, and FAS, as well as increasing levels of PPARα and its downstream target genes such as ACOX1, SCAD, CPT1-α, and FGF21, suggesting that PPARs might be at least partially responsible for the metabolic effects of the intervention.  De novo lipogenesis is a key mechanism for fat accumulation in the liver [51], which is often associated with the inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) [52, 53]. activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key metabolic master switch in hepatocytes, activated by exercise [54].",40dc1478-95f6-48f4-ac3d-9495ec8f30f3
23,methods23," Once activated, it will block anabolic pathways and promotes catabolic pathways and protects the cells from various stress stimuli, such as leading to increased fatty acid oxidation and suppression of fatty acid synthesis in hepatocytes [54]. activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation further phosphorylated and inactivated ACC, which can modulate the proximal and rate-limiting step of lipogenesis [55]. In this study, we observed that aerobic exercise combined with ketogenic diet significantly increased activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, activated protein kinase (AMPK)α1 and activated protein kinase (AMPK)α2 protein abundance when compared with the ketogenic diet mice. Furthermore, aerobic exercise combined with ketogenic diet significantly increased hepatic PPARα protein abundance and decreased PPARγ, in comparison with the ketogenic diet group [56].",4e25fadd-2576-4960-9ab5-2fc5b319bc76
24,methods24," Previous studies thought that antihepatic steatosis effects of activated protein kinase (AMPK) might be related to the regulation of proliferation key molecules in adipogenesis, such as PPARs. Taken together, the data obtained from our animal study indicates that aerobic exercise training combined with ketogenic diet ameliorates diabetes and hepatic and may involve activation of activated protein kinase (AMPK) and PPARs pathways in liver [57–59].  Hepatic steatosis reflects hepatic oversupply of lipids, often induced through multiple mechanisms, including an increased flux of dietary and liberated visceral FA, increased hepatic FA synthesis, and reduced hepatic FA oxidation [60]. To date, there are no approved pharmacologic therapies for the treatment of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Epidemiological studies suggest that exercise is a first-line therapy for patients with hepatic steatosis [29].",02a37a2c-a994-45f3-9319-00b4059d1c83
25,methods25," Impaired aerobic exercise capacity and skeletal muscle dysfunction appear to be associated with metabolic diseases, such as obesity, fatty liver, and diabetes. Also, numerous signaling pathways are involved in the initiation and progression of hepatic steatosis and related metabolic dysfunctions, and these pathways also interact with each other. In this research, we have focused on the role of activated protein kinase (AMPK)/PPARs, while we cannot exclude the possibility that other metabolic factors may be involved in this process. Thus, further investigations using activated protein kinase (AMPK) and PPARs knockout cells or mice models are useful to resolve these questions.  Traditional exercise guidelines have focused on low to moderate-intensity exercise because activities such as walking are easily achieved and relatively safe. However, such activities of daily living may not be able to provide an appropriate stimulus to increase cardiorespiratory fitness.",a307541e-097e-4574-ab82-b567d2369f70
26,methods26," High intensity interval training (High intensity interval training (HIIT)), which involves brief bursts of vigorous exercise separated by periods of rest or recovery, has garnered attention in recent years in diabetes [61, 62] and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [29, 63, 64]. The present data show that the time-efficient High intensity interval training (HIIT) may rapidly improve glucose control in diabetes and ameliorate hepatic steatosis. It needs further observation whether High intensity interval training (HIIT) is more feasible than aerobic exercise for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients with poor cardiorespiratory fitness or for those who cannot tolerate or participate in aerobic exercise.",45b95777-e4af-40b2-9cb5-76e9d49476ab
27,methods27,"  Collectively, the data presented here suggest that aerobic exercise training combined with ketogenic diet may play a pathologically important role in regulating obesity, diabetes, and hepatic steatosis, which is largely dependent on the regulation of the activated protein kinase (AMPK)/PPARs signaling.
