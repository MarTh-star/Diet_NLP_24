0,background0," Drug-resistant epilepsy is one of the most important features of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder. The ketogenic diet (KD) may be effective for patients with CDKL5-related epilepsy, but there is little high-quality evidence to confirm the efficacy. This meta-analysis investigated the efficacy and safety of KD in CDKL5-related epilepsy. ",62c3ce72-be75-4105-b963-93bdeedc6ee9
1,methods0," Search strategy  This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA)) guidelines [20]. We identified relevant studies using the following medical subject headings (MeSH) terms: ""Ketogenic Diet [Mesh]”, “CDKL5 Disorder [Mesh]”, and key words such as “Diets, Ketogenic”, “Ketogenic Diets”, “Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted”, “Diet therapy”, “ketosis”, “ketone”, “KD”, “CDKL5 deficiency disorder”, “Rett Syndrome, Atypical, Cdkl5-Related”, “Infantile Spasm Syndrome, X-Linked 2”, “Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 2″, and “Rett Syndrome, Variant, With Infantile Spasms” (Fig. 1). The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, WanFang, CNKI and VIP databases were searched. The final search was carried out January 1, 2022.Fig.",bbc9ebc1-700b-4c45-b718-caf169bc4288
2,methods1," 1 Searching strategy of literature  Inclusion and exclusion criteria  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomized controlled trials, case–control studies, cohort studies, and case series were included. Studies published in English and Chinese were included. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) research types: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomized controlled trials, case–control studies, cohort studies, and case series were included; (2) research objects: patients with epilepsy who had CDKL5 mutations; (3) interventions: patients received KD therapy; there were no restrictions on whether a control group was set.  Articles were excluded if they met the following criteria: (1) reviews, animal or in vitro studies; (2) no clear outcomes; and (3) literature not in English or Chinese.  Outcomes  Primary outcomes  Definite Responder Rate: The proportion of patients with seizure frequency reduced ≥ 50% from baseline after KD therapy.",b6f6fd39-e586-480a-98f8-64435a403c13
3,methods2,"  Secondary outcomes  Clinical Responder Rate: The parents or doctors judged the KD therapy to be “clinically effective” by reducing the seizure frequency by at least 50% or the percentage of reduction was unknown. The proportion of these patients was the clinical responder rate;  Clinical seizure-free rate: The proportion of seizure-free patients at the last follow-up after KD therapy;  Adverse reaction rate: The incidence of adverse reactions during KD therapy, including vomiting, diarrhea, feeding difficulty, lethargy, significant weight loss (≥ 10%), acidosis, urinary calculi and so on.  Literature screening, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment  Each study was independently assessed by two review authors (ZJ and MJY) to extract the relevant information, and the filtered information was crosschecked to ensure the integrity, objectivity, and correctness of the data. A third author (WY) checked all articles again to ensure correct interpretation of the data.",d3774243-75b7-426a-9070-e58a1a594bba
4,methods3," Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. For all included articles, the following data were extracted when available: (1) information of the studies: title, first author, year of publication, type of study; (2) baseline data of the subjects: adults or children, sample size, gender, age of seizure onset, type of seizure, frequency of seizure; (3) details of KD: age of initiation, treatment duration, reduction of seizure frequency, time of follow-up, adverse reactions.  Two review authors independently assessed the risk bias of the included studies. The methodological quality of randomized controlled trials was reviewed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the observational studies were reviewed using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS)) [21].

5,analysis0," The analysis for outcomes was descriptive, and data were summarized as the median and mean. RevMan software (version 5.3) was utilized for the statistical analysis. The heterogeneity of studies was evaluated with the I2 test. If there was no statistical heterogeneity among the studies (I2 ≤ 50%), the fixed effects model was used for meta-analysis. If there was statistical heterogeneity (I2 > 50%) among the results, the source of heterogeneity was further analyzed. After excluding the influence of obvious clinical heterogeneity, the random effects model was used for meta-analysis. Significant clinical heterogeneity was dealed with subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, or descriptive analysis only. The test level of the meta-analysis was set as α = 0.05. Subgroup analysis was performed according to the onset age before and after 1 month to compare the differences in efficacy. A funnel plot was used to test whether publication bias existed.

A total of 212 potentially relevant publications were systematically identified (104 records in English databases and 108 records in Chinese database). 27 duplicate records were removed. 138 studies were removed after the two independent reviewers read the titles and abstracts. Thirty-five studies were excluded after reading the full texts. Ultimately, 12 studies (9 studies in English and 3 studies in Chinese) with 193 patients were included for literature analysis [8, 19, 22–31].Fig. 2 Flow chart of literature screening  Basic characteristics and bias in the included studies  The basic characteristics of the included studies were shown in Table 1.

The remaining 8 studies [8, 19, 23, 26, 28–31] did not clearly define the efficacy, and a total of 159 patients were included. The responder rate was 52.2% (83/159). Among them, 2 studies [19, 23] mentioned that the median time of follow-up after KD was 2 years and 17 months, and 2 studies [22, 25] mentioned that the median time of follow-up was at least 3 months and 12 months. Follow-up time was not mentioned in other studies. Among them, 3 studies [19, 22, 23] did not define the efficacy, and the efficacy was only assessed by the parents through parent questionnaires. The remaining 5 studies [26, 28–31] only described the treatment as effective but did not define the efficacy. Five studies [22, 24, 27, 29, 30] mentioned seizure-free patients after KD.

15,discussion0," CDKL5 deficiency disorder is a rare neurological disorder leading to high morbidity and mortality. Epileptic encephalopathy is one of the most important manifestations and often shows a poor response to a variety of anti-seizure medications. There are no specific effective medications for this disorder, and there is no definite evidence for the efficacy of KD. As CDKL5 deficiency disorder is extremely rare, high-quality evidence from large-sample, randomized or prospective studies is relatively difficult to achieve. We performed a meta-analysis on KD in patients with CDKL5-related epilepsy to provide relatively reliable evidence and a data basis for future research.  The definite responder rate to KD in CDKL5-related epilepsy was low  The purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of KD in CDKL5-related epilepsy and to evaluate its possible adverse reactions. Twelve retrospective studies were included in this analysis. The responder rate varied widely from 0 to 66.",2974b5cf-3b91-48c4-ab13-eeb57eb53ee5
16,discussion1,"7% among different studies. Among them, 4 studies [22, 24, 25, 27] clearly defined the efficacy of KD therapy (seizure reduction ≥ 50%), and the responder rates were 0% (0/10), 10.0% (1/10), 16.7% (2/12), and 50.0% (1/2). For the results of the meta-analysis, the definite responder rate was only 18.0%. The remaining 8 studies [8, 19, 23, 26, 28–31] did not clearly define the efficacy, and the responder rates reported in each study ranged from 11.1% to 66.7%. For the results of the meta-analysis including all twelve studies, the clinical responder rate was 50.5%, which was much higher than the defined responder rate. The difference resulted from the fact that most of the studies did not define the responder as an outcome of efficacy. The outcomes were relatively unclear and could not represent the real efficacy of KD, which might overestimate the efficacy to some degree.",29e0dc81-0492-4fb1-bfe9-5f1720e0a79c
17,discussion2," A meta-analysis with 5 randomized controlled trials involving 472 children confirmed that the definite responder rate (seizure frequency reduction ≥ 50%) to KD in the treatment of children with drug-resistant epilepsy was 52.0% [32]. Compared with the efficacy of KD in drug-resistant epilepsy [32], the definite responder rate to KD in CDKL5-related epilepsy was low (18.% vs. 52.0%), and the literature with low-quality evidence might overestimate the efficacy in our study. More high-quality research evidence is needed in the future to confirm the efficacy.  The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions was high, and these were the most common adverse reactions.  For the safety of KD, a meta-analysis with five randomized controlled trials involving 472 children with refractory epilepsy [32] showed that gastrointestinal adverse reactions were the most common adverse reactions, with an incidence of 30%, manifested as vomiting, diarrhea and constipation.",7cbfb80e-8c38-46bb-94f9-4187113edd06
18,discussion3," In this analysis, only one study [23] mentioned adverse reactions during the KD, and the incidence of adverse reactions was 78.3% (18/23), manifested as constipation and vomiting. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions was relatively higher in the patients with CDKL5-related epilepsy during the KD. On the one hand, this might be related to the bias of low-quality evidence from the studies with small samples. On the other hand, CDKL5 deficiency disorder itself is prone to gastroesophageal reflux [8], while KD is a specific diet with a high fat ratio, which might be more likely to cause gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Further studies with higher quality are needed to confirm the safety of KD in CDKL5-related epilepsy.  Retrospective studies with low quality of evidence and incomplete details about KD might affect the reliability of the final results.",9f5f92e5-6992-4448-a27d-a9cd7316b37b
19,discussion4,"  All 12 studies included in the analysis were retrospective studies, and the quality of evidence of the studies was relatively low. Few studies have specifically targeted the efficacy of KD in CDKL5-related epilepsy. In this analysis, only two studies [19, 22] were targeted to analyze the efficacy of KD in CDKL5-related epilepsy. The main purpose of most studies [8, 23–25, 27–31] was to analyze the phenotypes related to CDKL5 gene mutations, and the efficacy was mentioned in the article, but without the specific details of KD therapy. Four studies [19, 22, 23, 25] clearly mentioned the follow-up time after KD, and the median time of follow-up in two studies was 2 years and 17 months, respectively. The other two studies performed at least 3 months and 12 months of follow-up. The follow-up time was reasonable in these four studies, and the efficacy was relatively reliable.",5abf7874-4434-4fcf-a044-ba27c6a71eb3
20,discussion5," The other 8 studies did not mention the follow-up time after KD, which might lead to an inaccurate evaluation of the real efficacy.  Regarding the outcomes to evaluate the efficacy of KD, the responders were clearly defined as having a seizure frequency reduced by more than 50% after KD only in only 4 studies [22, 24, 25, 27]. The responders in the remaining 8 studies did not clearly define the outcomes of efficacy. Among the 8 studies, the efficacy was evaluated through parent questionnaires without clear definition in 3 studies [19, 22, 23]. The outcomes were only described as “effective” in the articles without specific descriptions of seizure frequency reduction in the other 5 studies [26, 28–31]. In general, outcomes of efficacy were inaccurate in most studies, and the lack of detailed descriptions of KD might affect the final evaluation of the real efficacy of KD.  In addition, the sample sizes of the included studies varied greatly, ranging from 2 to 104 cases.",2c10f234-a1f6-43d3-9664-59c87d7d6aa4
21,discussion6," The sample sizes in 9 studies [19, 22, 23] were less than 10 cases. The small sample sizes might affect the accuracy of the meta-analysis results. Lim Z [19] performed the study with the largest sample size among the included studies, and the clinical responder rate was 58.7% (61/104). The relatively high responder rate might be related to the unclear definition of the efficacy and retrospective questionnaire for parents, which might lead to recall bias and selection bias.  Limitations  There were some limitations in this study. (1) All the included studies for meta-analysis were retrospective studies with low quality, and there was considerable heterogeneity among the studies. The accuracy of the results may be affected by the lack of multicenter, large-sample studies and small sample sizes in most included studies.",bede70c6-a40c-4eba-bb96-53eac36f8642
22,discussion7," (2) The efficacy was not strictly defined in most studies, and the outcomes were only described as “effective”, which was only judged by the parents or doctors, without specific descriptions of seizure frequency reduction. The relatively subjective judgments without a clear definition of the efficacy might affect the accuracy of the results. (3) A detailed description of KD therapy was not available in some studies. There might be some clinical heterogeneity among different studies caused by epileptic syndromes, seizure types, or whether anti-seizure drugs were adjusted during KD. Additional studies with larger sample sizes, higher quality, and more homogeneity are needed to confirm the efficacy of KD.  Conclusions  The systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the definite responder rate of KD in CDKL5-related epilepsy was only 18.0%.",d2e21bfa-6f3e-4721-9566-185af0a800d5
23,discussion8," The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions was high in some studies, so close attention should be devoted to gastrointestinal reactions during KD therapy. However, the included studies were all retrospective studies with low quality, and the sample sizes of most studies were small. Further prospective studies with large samples are needed to confirm the efficacy of KD in CDKL5-related epilepsy.
