0,methods0," 2.1. Mice and Diets  We designed two diets: a chow diet (control: Con) and a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)). Their nutritional information is shown in Table 1. Both diets were obtained from TROPHIC Animal Feed High-Tech Co., Ltd. (Nantong, Jiangsu, China).  Male C57BL/6J mice (n = 32) were purchased from Takasugi Experimental Animals Supply (Kasukabe, Japan) at 8 weeks of age, and were allowed to adapt to the environment for a week before formal experimentation commenced. Four animals were housed together in a cage (27 × 17 × 13 cm) under a controlled environment with a 12-h light–dark cycle (lights on at 08:00 and off at 20:00). The experimental procedures were approved and followed the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Animals of the Academic Research Ethical Review Committee of Waseda University (2018-A114).",279d14f6-87eb-48ff-b57e-7896ff5d4342
1,methods1," All mice were randomly divided into four groups: chow diet (Con), including chow diet with promotion of sedentary behavior (n = 8) and chow diet plus training (Con + T, n = 8, T is the abbreviation for training), as well as an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) with promotion of sedentary behavior (n = 8) and an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) plus exercise (low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) + T, n = 8). Mice on all diets had access to food ad libitum for 10 weeks, starting at 9 weeks of age.  2.2. Training Procedures, Forelimb Grip Strength Test, and Maximal Workload  All mice in the training group performed 1 h of forced treadmill running every training day. Training was done 5 days/week. The running speed was set to 22.5 m/min. The treadmill (Natsume, Tokyo, Japan) was set to a five-grade incline. The training period lasted 8 weeks.  A grip-strength meter (GPM-100; Melquest, Toyama, Japan) was used to measure forelimb grip strength.",27170bab-4d42-41fb-94c4-211de10f8ddb
2,methods2," As a mouse grasped the bar, the peak pull force in grams was recorded on a digital force transducer. In the conventional version of this test, the mouse is allowed to grasp the bar mounted on the force gauge. The gauge is reset to 0 g after stabilization, and the tail of the mouse is slowly pulled back by the inspector. Tension is recorded based on the gauge at the time the mouse released its forepaws from the bar. For the modified version of this test used in the current study, the gauge was rotated vertically and fixed to the metal stand to keep the system immobilized. The measurement procedure was identical to that in the conventional test, except for the direction in which the tail of the mouse was pulled by the inspector. For each test, trials in which only one forepaw or the hindlimbs were used, as well as those in which the mouse turned during the pull or left the bar without resistance, were excluded.",db2ff3c9-5ea2-48b9-b79a-42c290069f5b
3,methods3," Given that the speed of the tail pull can influence the measurement, we conducted the procedure at a constant speed that was sufficiently slow to permit mice to build up resistance against it. We performed three consecutive measurements per test at 30-second intervals.  Maximal exercise capacity was evaluated using a treadmill, according to a previously described method [20,21]. One week before training began, all mice were familiarized with running on a motorized rodent treadmill, as previously described [14]. After familiarization, mice performed two graded exercise performance tests at two time points, the first at 3 days before training, and the second 3 days after the 8-week training period. Tests started at 9 m/min for 9 min, going up to 10 m/min, and increasing by 2.5 m/min every 3 min. The starting incline was 0 and was raised by 5 every 9 min, with a maximal incline of 15.",0030dd11-3d4f-4103-964c-7eeb19f9230c
4,methods4," Exhaustion was defined as the inability of mice to continue regular treadmill running despite stimulation by repeated tapping on the back. At this point, running time (in min) was recorded, and each mouse was removed from the treadmill and returned to its home cage. Exercise capacity was expressed in time (min) and work (kg·m). The work performed (kg·m) was calculated as the product of body weight (kg) and vertical distance (m), where:vertical distance = (distance run) (sin θ)(1)  where θ was the angle of the treadmill, from 0 to 15 [15,16]. A second pair of exercise performance tests was completed after the training period, and changes in exercise capacity were calculated.  2.3. Sampling and Plasma Biochemical Assessment  Two days after the final training, mice were fasted for 12 h and sacrificed under light anesthesia with isoflurane (Abbott, Tokyo, Japan). Blood samples were taken from the abdominal aorta using heparin under inhalant isoflurane-induced mild anesthesia.",b290dfcf-5401-4d6d-a564-02a56317e503
5,methods5," Tissues and organs were immediately excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Plasma was obtained from blood samples by centrifugation at 1500× g for 10 min at 4 °C. These samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis. The whole liver, epididymal fat, brown fat, and a muscle fascicle from the left hind leg, containing the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles, were weighed. Plasma levels of glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (non esterified fatty acids (NEFA)), triglyceride (TG), lipase, amylase, aspartate transaminase (aspartate transaminase (AST)), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)), blood urea nitrogen (blood urea nitrogen (BUN)), urea acid (UA), creatinine, total cholesterol (T-CHO), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (H-CHO), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (L-CHO), and albumin were measured by Koutou-Biken Co. (Tsukuba, Japan). A commercial assay kit was employed to measure the β-hydroxybutyrate concentration (Cayman, MI, USA).  2.",11b77c30-7043-441a-afc7-62a6b382b584
6,methods6,"4. Real-Time PCR  Total RNA was extracted from the gastrocnemius muscle (fast-twitch muscle) and soleus muscle (slow-twitch muscle) using the RNeasy Fibrous Mini Kit, as well as from epididymal adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purity and concentration of total RNA were assessed using the NanoDrop system (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR was performed on the Fast 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using the Fast SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycle profiles consisted of 10 min at 95 °C for denaturation, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 3 s and annealing at 60 °C for 15 s.",17421995-aa5f-41bf-8aac-40a8d4fc00d3
7,methods7," 18s ribosomal RNA was used as the housekeeping gene, and the ⊿⊿CT method was used to quantify target gene expression. All data are represented as fold change relative to expression values of the Con group. Primers used for real-time PCR are shown in Table 2.  2.5. Plasma Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) and Testosterone Assessment  Plasma FGF21 concentrations were measured using the R&D Mouse FGF21 ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma testosterone concentrations were measured using a commercial ELISA kit (Cayman, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  2.6. Muscle Glycogen Assessment  Gastrocnemius muscle glycogen content was measured using a commercial kit (Cayman, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  2.7. Statistical Analysis  Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).",9804c9c0-61a7-492a-a240-2860b5fb7efc
8,methods8," A two-way analysis of variance (A two way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) was performed to determine the effects of diet, training, and time. The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad, Ltd., La Jolla, CA, USA). When A two way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated a significant effect, a Tukey’s post hoc test was performed to determine the significance of differences between means. Associations between variables were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.  3. Results  3.1. Weight Change and Relative Tissue or Organ Weight  As shown in Figure 1, the average weight of mice in each group varied drastically. After training began at Week 2, significant differences in weight were observed between mice of the Con group and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) group. At the end of Week 6, a significant difference was observed between Con and Con + T mice.",a7bf3b32-b132-4c45-b1ae-2354b6bb0d05
9,methods9," Throughout the whole study, no significant difference was observed between low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) + T.  As shown in Figure 2, the tissue/organ ratio of liver weight (Figure 2A) or brown adipose tissue weight (Figure 2C) to body weight did not significantly change due to training or diet. A muscle fascicle from the left hind leg containing the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles was also weighed. Training increased the skeletal muscle/body weight ratio, while diet had no effect (Figure 2B). Training also had a significant effect on the WAT (Figure 2D; WAT indicates epididymal adipose tissue) of mice, as WAT from training group mice weighed less than that from the non-training group mice. However, according to our results, this lowering effect only occurred in animals on the control diet. In the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) group, training did not reduce WAT weight.  3.2.",7f383899-798f-49fc-ae7f-0bea748db66f
10,methods10," Grip Power and Maximal Exercise Capacity Test  To evaluate the effects of diet and training on muscle strength, grip power was assessed. Grip power was measured at two time points: at the beginning of Week 2, and again at the end of Week 10, after the training intervention finished. As shown in Figure 3A, training had a positive effect on grip-power performance. In fact, at the end of the experiment, a trend of increase in absolute grip power was observed between the Con and Con + T mice, as well as between the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) + T mice. Taking the weight difference between the groups into consideration, we also corrected grip power based on body weight.",8a4c72c8-fb9e-41bb-a9c9-4be5af89205a
11,methods11," As shown in Figure 3B, after the correction, while a decreasing trend was observed between Con mice at baseline and after intervention, a trend of increase was observed between the baseline low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) + T after intervention.  As shown in Figure 4, at the end of the study, training enhanced maximal exercise capacity in both the Con and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) groups. Compared to baseline (Week 2), after a 2-month period of training, maximal exercise capacity was enhanced only in the Con group. The enhancement of exercise capacity in the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) group (baseline compared to after training period) was not significant.  Taking the considerable change in body weight between groups into consideration, we also calculated the maximal workload (Table 3).",b2a27198-90b5-4d51-aef7-9966372b9c48
12,methods12," The 8-week training period significantly enhanced maximal workload in both the Con and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) groups, with significant differences observed between Con and Con + T, as well between as low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) + T.  3.3. Analysis of Plasma Biochemical Indexes  We further measured several fundamental biochemical indexes, including the plasma levels of cholesterol, glucose, albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, UA, non esterified fatty acids (NEFA), TG, LDL, HDL, and β-hydroxybutyrate. As shown in Table 4, among measured markers, the 10-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) caused a dramatic increase in the plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentration and significantly reduced plasma glucose levels. Total cholesterol, L-CHO, and H-CHO were all elevated due to the high fat content of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD).",dccfc08a-d817-430e-9fb7-d9cc1f8f638d
13,methods13," Plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were significantly lowered in the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) group. Creatinine was lower in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) mice compared to Con mice, and was elevated in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) mice who underwent training compared to those that did not. The non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) pool was also increased by the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). Of note, the 8-week treadmill training regimen significantly lowered plasma TG concentrations, demonstrating the protective effects of exercise against hyperlipidemia. Albumin and UA levels were not affected by either the 10-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) or the 8-week training regimen.  We used amylase, aspartate transaminase (AST), CK, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and lipase as muscle or organ damage markers.",208d41fd-248c-4667-a366-cd6c79899187
14,methods14," As shown in Table 5, plasma aspartate transaminase (AST) and lipase levels were significantly increased by the 10-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), while other markers were not altered by diet or training.  3.4. Plasma FGF21 and Testestorone Concentrations  As shown in Figure 5, plasma FGF21 levels were increased by the 10-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), while plasma testosterone was not altered by diet or training.  3.5. Muscle Glygocen Content  As shown in Table 6, among the groups, training exhibited a tendency to increase muscle glycogen content, but no significance was observed. The low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) also did not affect muscle glycogen content.  3.6. Gene Expression in Tissues and Organs  We analyzed changes in the expression of relevant metabolism-associated genes in various tissues.",5a2c2856-0134-481d-99e5-dcd5bcb8b33d
15,methods15," As shown in Table 7, the 10-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) decreased Adiponectin (anti-inflammation), Atgl (fatty acid mobilization), F4/80 (inflammation), Il-6 (inflammation), Leptin (energy metabolism), and Pgc1α (energy metabolism) expression levels in WAT, while the expression of Cd36 (fatty acid transportation), Klotho (FGF21 receptor), Prdm16, and Pparγ (browning of white adipose tissue) was not altered. The 8-week training regimen decreased Leptin expression in the control diet groups, but no synergistic effect of diet and training was observed in the low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet groups.  As shown in Table 8, we observed that the expression of Ucp-1 in BAT was significantly upregulated by the 10-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). Training had no effect effects on Ucp-1 expression, while other genes related to BAT thermogenesis function (Cidea and Prdm16) or inflammation (Il6) were not affected by neither factor.",bd8eed4b-b551-402c-b9f9-b4a39033fc25
16,methods16,"  As shown in Table 9, in the gastrocnemius muscle, which represented fast-twitch, glycolytic muscle, the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) reduced glycogen synthesis, glycogenolysis, and glucose metabolism by downregulating Gs (glycogen synthesis), Gp (glycogen phosphatase), and Hk2 (glycolysis). These changes were indicative of reduced glycometabolism resulting from the low carbohydrate intake during low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). Mct1 (ketone body transportation) expression was upregulated by low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). The expression levels of Acat1 (ketone body metabolism), Hadh (fatty acid oxidation), Hbdh (ketone body metabolism), Oxct1 (ketone body metabolism), Cd36 (fatty acid transportation), Cox4 (mitochondrial respiration), Cytochrome c (mitochondrial respiration), Sirt1 (mitochondrial respiration), and Tfam (mitochondrial respiration) were not significantly affected by either factor.",306643a3-9558-4795-9afd-41223de9aeae
17,methods17,"  As shown in Table 10, in the soleus muscle, representative of slow-twitched oxidative muscle, we found that the expression of ketone body transporter Mct1 (3.75 fold in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and 2.67 fold in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) + T), fatty acid oxidation related Cpt1α (1.35 fold in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and 1.29 fold in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) + T), Hadh (4.19 fold in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and 4.28 fold in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) + T), and Mcad (3.75 fold in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and 5.53 fold in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) + T) was upregulated. Tfam (mitochondrial respiration) and Cox4 (mitochondrial respiration) expression was also increased (1.63 fold in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and 1.38 fold in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) + T for Tfam, 2.00 fold in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), and 2.",7668fced-5ce8-42e4-b1f4-1656df3a1e70
18,methods18,"51 fold in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) + T for Cox4) by low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), indicating an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in the soleus muscle. Il6, which may induce lipolysis, was upregulated in the soleus muscle, but not significantly. The expression of key ketolysis genes Acat1, Hbdh, and Oxct1 did not change significantly.  4. Discussion  During low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) feeding, the body enters a unique metabolic state that mimics the state of fasting. The exact mechanism through which an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) lowers weight is not completely understood, but possible mechanisms include: (1) appetite suppression [22]; (2) increased energy expenditure [23]; and (3) enhanced lipid metabolism and decreased triglyceride storage demand [19]. However, according to our results, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) mice consumed more calories, leaving (2) and (3) as possible underlying mechanisms.",da6e1562-c118-4ae4-ad40-165ee3d0c1de
19,methods19,"  In accordance with our previous results, a 10-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) contributed to considerable weight loss [19]. Our current findings revealed that while the 8-week treadmill training regimen exhibited a tendency to reduce the average weight in mice on a chow diet, it did not have weight-lowering effects in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice, which means that extra physical activity could not further contribute to weight loss when an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) was employed, or at least by a relatively short-term low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) regimen combined with training.",366b055e-0dd1-4057-9991-a5e6c3e266b8
20,methods20," The current opinion of the effect of an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) on weight loss is controversial; two meta-analyses discussing this reached different conclusions: one showing that individuals assigned to an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) achieve a greater weight loss than those assigned to a low-fat diet [24]; while the other argued that weight loss was induced by either diet, a low-carbohydrate diet, or an isoenergetic balanced diet [25]. However, the above two studies did not involve training. Further studies are encouraged to find whether a longer period of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and training could contribute to further weight loss, especially in lean subjects, since most of the previous studies were conducted in obese individuals. A similar pattern was observed in WAT weight change. Training significantly reduced WAT weight in the chow diet group, indicating that the training intensity (1 h/day, 5 days/week, at a fixed speed of 22.",0aaf7e04-bbf0-4b05-8a77-1d5a572bbe95
21,methods21,"5 m/s) was sufficient to reduce body fat in a mouse model. Interestingly, training did not reduce fat weight in the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) group. While ketogenic diets have shown promising weight-control effects in various random controlled trials, few studies have been conducted in adults with a normal weight [26,27,28]. Our results indicated that a ketogenic diet may not induce further weight loss or body fat loss in such individuals.  Some researchers have suggested that due to the low protein content of the KD, loss of muscle volume may be a concern [29]. However, our results indicated that the relative muscle mass was not lower in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice compared to controls. In addition to muscle weight, we evaluated muscle strength by employing a grip test. While the absolute grip strength decreased when corrected for body weight, an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) did not reduce grip strength.",16db4e2f-ac08-4ab6-a2dc-4b46df405873
22,methods22," In general, exercise capacity includes endurance and explosive force capacity. The grip-power test evaluates the explosive force. Although muscle volume may not be influenced, the output rate of explosive power (mainly determined by fast-twitch muscle, utilizing glycometabolism as the energy source) may be compromised due to a deactivated and insufficient glycometabolic capacity [30]. The low average weight of individuals in the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) + T groups may be another reason absolute grip power was lowered in the indicated groups. Although several studies reported that short-term low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) or nutritional ketosis had no detrimental effect on power or strength in sports, such as artistic gymnastics and tactical athletes [31,32], other works suggested a detrimental effect, as observed in off-road cycling [33].",7f61b667-f8a0-4dc1-8b79-15032303cda8
23,methods23," Our results indicated that an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) might be a preferable dietary approach for athletes that require output strength while maintaining a low body weight profile (e.g., in boxing, judo, etc.). Future studies should take this complicated effect of a long-term low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) into consideration when evaluating its effects on athletes.  To evaluate whether a 10-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and/or an 8-week treadmill training enhanced maximal exercise capacity, we employed a graded treadmill exercise capacity test. According to previous studies, an 8-week ketogenic diet induced favorable changes in ketolytic gene expression and fatty acid oxidation gene expression, thus enhancing exercise performance in a mouse model [19]. Chronic endurance training has been confirmed to enhance fatty acid oxidation capacity. However, in our present study, the effects of diet and exercise were not additive.",34454dd7-2ac5-4105-b582-895868e50406
24,methods24," We employed a high-intensity evaluation system in the present study (uphill running with a maximal incline of 15 and a maximal speed of 42.5 m/s). However, when training was combined with a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), the outcome was not improved compared with chow diet plus training. While an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) may favor lipid metabolism, high-intensity exercise requires high-output glycometabolism [34]. During low-intensity exercise, e.g., at 25% VO2max, enhanced lipolysis is observed in peripheral adipocytes. However, regardless of exercise intensity, lipolysis in the peripheral adipose tissue remains stable, while glycometabolism plays a pivotal role during high-intensity exercise [34].",0cf71513-23ab-4881-92eb-45ce7091a31a
25,methods25," Taking these observations into consideration, we further analyzed the changes in plasma biochemistry indexes, as well as changes in gene expression in various tissues, in order to determine to what extent low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) affects the lipid pool and lipid metabolic capacity.  Among evaluated biomarkers, creatinine is released into blood at a constant rate depending on muscle mass. Mice in the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) group had lower creatinine levels compared to those in the other groups, indicative of reduced protein metabolism due to the low protein content of the diet, which is consistent with our previous results [18,19]. Plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were also significantly lower in the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) group, which may be another consequence of the low protein content of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD).  aspartate transaminase (AST) was increased by an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD).",eb9ebf08-1961-4311-9355-87524dc2d77c
26,methods26," aspartate transaminase (AST) is utilized as a key marker for the evaluation of hepatic damage. Previous studies reported that long-term high-fat diets, including the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), might result in unfavorable alternations of hepatic function. Research has shown that the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) burdens hepatic function by aggravating endoplasmic reticulum stress and hepatocyte apoptosis [35,36]. In previous studies, an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) initially induced mild oxidative stress in the liver, thus activating the nuclear factor E2 related-factor 2 transcription factor [36,37]. It should be noted that the enhanced anti-oxidative reaction is a consequence of an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), meant to counteract oxidative stress. Further, the use of antioxidants is recommended while on an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) regimen [38].",19b4e4d5-838c-4801-8519-048020aae4f9
27,methods27," An low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) improved plasma lipase levels, which may reflect an enhanced fat utilization capacity, since carbohydrate intake was restricted in both the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) + T group. Amylase, a pancreatic damage marker; CK, a marker of muscle damage; and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which is employed as a cardiac damage marker, were not affected by low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) or by training. To summarize, an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) induced a unique metabolic status, characterized by an increased lipid pool and enhanced lipid oxidation capacity, and causing stress to hepatocytes. Further, the combination of an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and training had no additive effects.  FGF21 is reported to induce thirst, as well as to improve whole-body energy metabolism, thus contributing to weight loss [39].",bc8dafe8-e8ed-4fae-80fc-e568d3c480b4
28,methods28," Both the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and acute exercise are known to increase FGF21 concentration in the circulation [15,40]. In the present study, we demonstrated that while the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) elevated plasma FGF21, long-term training did not significantly affect FGF21 in the circulation. The enhanced level of FGF21 in the circulation may, to some extent, explain why the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) induced dramatic weight loss.  Exercise increases testosterone levels, while obesity induced by a high-fat diet may decrease testosterone, and supplementation of testosterone may contribute to maintaining muscle mass [16]. Our results showed that the 2-month training regimen or a 10-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) had no significant effect on plasma testosterone levels. Therefore, training plus an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) may not affect testosterone-related muscle hypertrophy.",437e879d-fce5-4c73-bb32-6b5483b8fd91
29,methods29,"  Due to the low carbohydrate content of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), we considered that the glycogen storage in muscle tissue may be reduced. Glycogen storage in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice was not significantly decreased. Further, training increased muscle glycogen content. We also demonstrated that glycogen content was not reduced due to the low carbohydrate content in the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). Further, training only exhibited a tendency to increase muscle glycogen content, reflecting the glycogen-loading effect. However, no significant difference was observed.  During exercise, the crosstalk between adipose tissue and muscle tissue is crucial [41].",f0391639-f05a-4b18-a0bb-3071965630f1
30,methods30," Adiponectin, an adipokine secreted from the adipose tissue, regulates glucose and fatty acid metabolism directly, and via insulin-sensitizing effects, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties in the muscle, while levels of circulating adiponectin were reported to be decreased in obese individuals, and a negative correlation between adiponectin and circulating lipid profile was observed [42]. In the current study, the lipid pool in plasma increased as a result of the decrease in weight in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) mice. The expression level of adiponectin in the adipose tissue decreased. These results are rather complex when taking the other results into consideration.",ca418b84-96d3-44c5-9c59-3409769dafff
31,methods31," An low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) may reduce adipose inflammation by suppressing immune-cell infiltration (as indicated by F480 expression, employed as a marker for macrophage infiltration) and cytokine production (as indicated by Il6 expression, employed as a marker for inflammation), while also downregulating adiponectin and thus reducing its metabolic effects. A 3–4-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) was reported to alleviate inflammation in juvenile and adult rat models, while lipid accumulation was reported to downregulate Atgl and Pgc1α expression in Drosophia [43,44]. In agreement with previous studies, our work indicated that regular training may ameliorate inflammation in adipose tissue by downregulating Il6 expression [45].  Ucp-1, also known as thermogenin, plays important roles in metabolic and energy balance, inducing non-shivering thermogenesis. Further, increasing the expression of Ucp-1 may induce weight loss and be employed to treat obesity [46].",61223f6b-318c-4b81-925f-8d193bce6f3a
32,methods32," An low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) usually induces weight loss, but the underlying mechanism has not been extensively explored. Our results revealed that an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) may induce weight loss by upregulating the expression of Ucp-1 in BAT. Nakao et al. reported that an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) induced Slc25a25, an ATP carrier in the inner mitochondria membrane that is partially responsible for thermogenesis in muscle [47]. Considering this together with our current results, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) may induce weight loss through joint thermal regulation in both muscle tissue and BAT.  In the current work, we demonstrated that the glycogen content in the muscle tissue was not affected by the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). We also hypothesized that the reason for the reduction in absolute grip power might be a deactivated glycometabolism system in glycolytic fast-twitch muscle.",535d38d6-f190-41c5-a064-554b0d60db5d
33,methods33," In slow-twitch oxidative muscle, ketone body transporter Mct1, as well as fatty acid oxidation-related genes Cpt1α, Hadh, and Mcad, were all upregulated, which was in agreement with previous studies [19]. Tfam and Cox4 (mitochondrial respiration) were also upregulated by the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), indicative of an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in the soleus muscle and an enhanced capacity for KB transport and fatty acid oxidation. These results indicated that the fatty acid oxidation capacity in slow-twitch oxidative muscle was improved by the 10-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), which is in line with our previous results [19]. However, in our past works, we employed a low-intensity exhaustive exercise evaluation model, and an 8-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) enhanced exercise capacity [18,19].",23d7dbff-7be4-46f3-b2bb-10e9ac9a1588
34,methods34," In the present study, even though fatty acid transport and oxidation genes were significantly upregulated, a 10-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) did not improve the time to exhaustion in the maximal exercise capacity test when compared to the control diet. Therefore, an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), which favors fatty acid oxidation, may not be useful for sports that require high-intensity energy output and vigorous glucose supply.  In a recent study, researchers reported that the response of liver metabolic pathways to the KD and exercise were not additive, although an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) alone did induce alternations as oxidative rates to catabolize lipids and ketogenic amino acids were enhanced; these effects, which may improve the energy metabolism and thus favor endurance and performance, were not further enhanced while combined with treadmill training [48].",b5d37d54-d642-4359-b3c2-afb7e37388c5
35,methods35," We observed the same pattern in the muscle tissue, as the enhancing effects of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) on lipid metabolism were not further improved by the addition of training.  The limitation of the present study is that only a maximal exercise capacity test was employed, while the activated lipid metabolic system exhibits potential to favor the low- to moderate-intensity exercise, further studies are encouraged to examine the synergistic effects of an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and training using a different evaluating model. Another limitation is the absence of measuring baseline grip power before the feeding intervention started. Although after correction, the relative grip power was not decreased during low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) feeding, the mechanisms remain unknown.",67c19f8e-3b56-4a1f-b85c-269763ee3180
36,methods36," IGF-1, which may be a key factor in maintaining muscle mass and strength, may be involved in the above process, while genes that involve in protein synthesis and breakdown that were not measured in the present study may be also adjusted by an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), and further study is encouraged.  The major finding of the present study is that an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) enhanced the fatty acid oxidation capacity in oxidative muscle tissue, but this capacity was not further improved with training. The enhancement of fatty acid oxidation capacity did not, however, translate to an improvement in performance during highly intensive exercise. In addition, the muscle strength adjusted to weight was not compromised by the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). Further studies are required to optimize the application of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) to maximize its beneficial effects.  5.",ba3a6b94-d69f-411a-8479-d0853e2f4f6d
37,methods37," Conclusions  In the present study, we combined a 10-week low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) with an 8-week treadmill training regimen to investigate whether this combination would favor exercise performance. The present results revealed that training enhanced maximal exercise capacity; though the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) had no practical effects to enhance the maximal exercise capacity, it was capable of enhancing the expression of genes that favor fatty acid oxidation in oxidative muscle, and thus may be promising for the improvement of endurance capacity during moderate-intensity exercise, but may not be an optimal choice for those partaking in high-intensity exercise.
