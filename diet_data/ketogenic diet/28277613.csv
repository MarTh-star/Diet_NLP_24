0,introduction0,"Ischemic stroke, a leading cause of destructive cerebrovascular diseases, is characterized by disrupted blood flow and glucose/oxygen deprivation of brain cells, which may result in cellular dysfunction (Fisher and Saver, 2015). Current treatments for ischemic stroke are limited because of its complex molecular mechanisms . Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, and the role of nucleotide-binding domain (nucleotide binding domain (NOD))-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in stroke has been a focus in current studies (Kawabori and Yenari, 2015). The NLRP3 inflammasome is a molecular platform in which pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as caspase-1 and interleukin-1β [IL-1β]) are activated to induce inflammation . It has been confirmed that NLRP3 inflammasome is activated since the onset of ischemic stroke (Fann et al.",afafb7f6-bd1c-4d31-9468-0250880ecf29
1,introduction1,", 2013b), and treatments targeting NLRP3 inflammasome are found to be promising for the treatment of stroke .  Under physiological condition, NLRP3 typically localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Upon activation, NLRP3 and its adaptor apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein (associated Speck like protein (ASC)) translocate to the perinuclear space, where they co-localize with ER and mitochondrial organelle clusters . Mitochondria are remarkably dynamic organelles that can traffic, divide and fuse. The cycles of mitochondrial fission and fusion ensure normal metabolic and bioenergetic functions . Mitochondrial fission can trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome upon RNA virus infection, in which, dynamin-related protein1 (Drp1), a key regulator of mitochondrial fission, plays an important role (Rayamajhi and Miao, 2014).",52bd6a85-6c28-424a-9774-c8336d4f6d44
2,introduction2," Our previous study revealed that Drp1 translocating to the mitochondria mediated the mitochondrial fission, and pharmacological inhibition of Drp1 translocation prevented mitochondrial fragmentation, therefore protecting neurons from oxygen–glucose deprivation (oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)) induced injury . However, the mechanism by which Drp1 regulates NLRP3-mediated inflammation in ischemic stroke remains unclear.  Following ischemia, the newly synthesized proteins accumulate to increase the unfolded protein response (unfolded protein response (UPR)). Severe and prolonged unfolded protein response (UPR) may induce ER stress. The ER stress sensor IRE1a can induce thioredoxin-interacting protein (thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP)) to activate NLRP3-mediated inflammation and programmed cell death .",7ab419e3-9d8f-464b-9b06-a5325b7e8250
3,introduction3," Reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) generated from mitochondrial fission can activate NLRP3 inflammasome to exacerbate ER stress, which further impairs the mitochondrial morphology and function . Suppression of ER stress and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation has also been found to alleviate NLRP3-mediated inflammation in stroke.  Disruption of blood flow and/or a decrease in blood glucose concentration in ischemic stroke may cause brain injury. Ketone bodies (KBs), which include acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), may serve as alternative substrates to glucose in the brain. BHB is a major member of KBs. It is generated from fatty acid oxidation and can be converted into BHB by ketogenesis in the liver mitochondria. A ketogenic diet (KD) or BHB has been found to improve the cerebral edema and infarct volume following stroke .",e20251ca-974c-45bd-8444-cb24013b684e
4,introduction4," Moreover, BHB can prevent neuronal death induced by glucose deprivation or hypoxia (Camberos-Luna et al., 2016). Recent studies also reveal that BHB is able to suppress the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in human hepatoma HepG2 cells and monocytes . However, the role of KBs in the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome in the central nervous system after ischemia remains unknown.  In this study, effects of KD and BHB on NLRP3 inflammasome were investigated in mice with middle cerebral artery occlusion (middle cerebral artery occlusion (middle cerebral artery (MCA)O)) and SH-SY-5Y cells subjected to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)/reoxygenation (oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)/R), respectively, and the potential mechanism was further explored.",a8435d2e-300e-4207-abe1-ab33285c0d04
5,introduction5," Our results revealed that KD and BHB were able to improve cerebral ischemia by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which was ascribed to the suppression of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission and the inhibition of ER stress.  ",87dec6a3-24f4-465a-a5a6-4f5fa1d11d2f

33,results8,"  BHB Improved Cell Viability and Prevented Mitochondrial Fission in Cells Subjected to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)/R The effects of BHB on ischemia-related injury were further investigated in an oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)/R cell model. BHB treatment prior to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)/R increased cell viability and decreased Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) release after oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)/R (Figures 4A,B). Under oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)/R, mitochondrial dynamics towards fission play crucial roles in the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and apoptosis induction (Otera and Mihara, 2012). The balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion controls the mitochondrial morphology and function (Westermann, 2002). Thus, the mitochondrial morphology was investigated in SH-SY-5Y cells. Results showed oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)/R caused significant mitochondrial fragmentation, whereas BHB prevented the mitochondrial fission (Figure 4C).",cd46fb7b-3892-436e-899b-b92e069c3d8f

Consistent with this finding, cells treated with BHB displayed a higher proportion of tubular, long mitochondria (Figures 4D–F). Because mitochondrial fission was mainly controlled by Drp1, cells were treated with the small molecule mitochondrial division inhibitor (mdivi-1) to inhibit Drp1. These cells showed decreased mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings reveal oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)/R likely causes excessive mitochondrial fission, and BHB may induce the mitochondrial morphological changes by inhibiting Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission.

The results of the present study showed that, under ischemic conditions, cellular NLRP3 inflammasome was activated by hypoxia-ischemia insult, thus leading to brain tissue damage. Moreover, KD pre-treatment suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation by inhibiting Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission and ER stress, which alleviated brain dysfunction in ischemic stroke.  KD is a high-fat diet in which carbohydrates are nearly eliminated, and it provides sufficient protein for growth but insufficient amounts of carbohydrates for the body’s metabolic needs. Thus, the oxidation of a large amount of fat in liver mitochondria leads to elevated circulating KBs (acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate and acetone; Gasior et al., 2006).",92404438-2a28-4c5c-850c-6afb71871f4d

KD, which has been successfully used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy, has been found to confer neuroprotective effects on the cerebral ischemic injuries .",c469e684-73be-426b-bdf2-1236d02ac906
48,discussion2," Actually, in animal studies, a ketogenic state (induced by KD, exogenously administered KBs or calorie restriction) is proven to exert an overall significant protective effect on outcomes (decreased lesion volume, neurological score and edema, and improved survival, neuronal count and behavior) following brain ischemia in various models, including the middle cerebral artery occlusion (middle cerebral artery (MCA)O) model, vessel occlusion model and cardia arrest model . Both chronic interventions like calorie restriction for 3 months or KD for 3 weeks and acute interventions like calorie restriction for 4 days or ketone administration from several days to 30 min before the onset of experimental stroke can exert protective effects (Suzuki et al., 2001; Puchowicz et al., 2008; Tai et al., 2008; Yoon et al., 2011).",8447c04a-9b77-424c-b3c5-b40ac573a534

In the present study, our results also indicate that 3-week KD was able to enhance the brain ischemic tolerance to middle cerebral artery occlusion (middle cerebral artery (MCA)O) in mice, as demonstrated by improvements of infarct area, neurological score, Blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cellular apoptosis.  In spite of emerging evidence from preclinical investigations demonstrating the beneficial effects of KD, mechanisms underlying its effects are not well studied.

50,discussion4," (2008) found the hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) level was elevated after 3-week KD treatment because increased succinate inhibited the prolyl-hydroxylase, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of HIF. Our previous study reported the transcription of HIF target genes including erythropoietin (erythropoietin (EPO)), endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), Glut-1 and MCT4 increased and this increase was partly related to the elevated HIF expression . Moreover, Ly-6CLo monocytes and/or macrophages express hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2), a receptor for BHB, which has been reported to reduce neuroinflammation and exert a protective effect on the brain injury after KD (Rahman et al., 2014; Offermanns and Schwaninger, 2015). Other inflammatory responses, especially NLRP3 inflammasome, are also important in post-ischemic damage. Nevertheless, the effects of KD on NLRP3 inflammasome in the central nerves system remain unclear.",2e34e4e3-12a7-4286-874a-6b1833155869
51,discussion5,"  The NLRP3 inflammasome is an important component in innate immune response, and contributes significantly to ischemic brain injury following stroke. The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated following cerebral ischemia, and pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory response can prevent the deterioration of cerebral function (Fann et al., 2013a,b). In this study, whether the neuroprotective effects of KD pre-treatment were related to the inhibition of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory response was further investigated. Our results revealed that middle cerebral artery occlusion (middle cerebral artery (MCA)O) and oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) induced thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 inflammasome activation and significantly increased caspase-1 activity and IL-1β release. However, KD or BHB pre-treatment significantly suppressed the NLRP3-mediated inflammatory response, as confirmed after use of the NLRP3 inhibitor CP456773.",e82016ea-1fb6-4e70-be2b-91a59a665d38
52,discussion6," However, the specific mechanism by which KD regulates NLRP3 inflammasome remains still unclear.  Although increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria serve as a regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by producing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) or DNA in response to damage , the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the inflammasome pathway in neurons is still unknown. Our results indicated that Drp1 acted a downstream factor regulated by KD and could regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome activation during ischemic injury. Drp1, normally found in the cytosol, is a GTPase that mediates mitochondrial fission (Archer, 2013). Phosphorylated Drp1 can translocate to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it interacts with the mitochondrial fission protein Fis1 to induce mitochondrial fission, thus generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activating NLRP3 inflammasome (Knott et al., 2008; Archer, 2013).",7530daf0-c2e8-4d4a-9ac9-90634d4da0f2
53,discussion7," Our results showed oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)/R induced Drp1 mitochondrial translocation to cause aberrant mitochondrial fission, thus leading to the significant NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In contrast, BHB pre-treatment suppressed Drp1 translocation and mitochondrial fragmentation, attenuating NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These results were consistent with previously reported that BHB could block the NLRP3 inflammasome activation . In addition, abnormal mitochondrial function, including decreased ATP generation and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), could be reversed by BHB as well as Drp1 inhibitor mdivi-1. Taken together, our results provide a molecular insight into the effects of BHB on the mitochondrial dynamics-regulated NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",e458c61e-9149-4e94-81ba-7ccc37709bb7
54,discussion8,"  It has been proposed that increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to mitochondrial dysfunction can be sensed by the complex thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) and then induce the dissociation of this complex . In normal cells, thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) is constitutively maintained in the reduced state; in case of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, this complex dissociates and thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) binds to the LRR region of NLRP3, leading to the NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Tschopp and Schroder, 2010).",9a9637a7-0f63-42b3-bc3a-b6efb7e2cbb1
55,discussion9," In the present study, BHB pre-treatment reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cells subjected to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)/R, and BHB or reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor N acetyl L cysteine (NAC) could attenuate the activation of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 inflammasome, indicating that BHB may protect cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated NLRP3 activation following oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)/R.  ER stress is an essential progress in the brain ischemia-reperfusion injury . The ER stress sensors PERK and IRE1α can induce thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome . IRE1α also induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent NLRP3 translocation to mitochondria, leading to the release of mitochondrial signals that further activate the inflammasome .",3ec7fc53-01b3-4695-ae70-b9adec97dfb7
56,discussion10," As expected, the p-PERK-p-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway was activated and CHOP expression increased significantly in the brain of middle cerebral artery occlusion (middle cerebral artery (MCA)O) mice, suggesting ER stress, which was significantly attenuated in the KD group. In vivo, the ER stress inducer tunicamycin or oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)/R activated the NLRP3 inflammasome, but BHB pre-treatment reduced this inflammation response, which was similar to the effects of ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). Collectively, these results indicate that KD or BHB is able to ameliorate ER stress-associated NLRP3 inflammasome activation.  When considering KD as a preventive therapy for high risk population of stroke, we must take into account the clinical safety, especially if the high cholesterol content of KD may cause dyslipidemia and increase the risk for stroke.",b8e4048f-2ccd-43b0-acf7-51fe1161d2cf
57,discussion11," It was reported that the postprandial triacylglycerol (TG) reduced, oxidized low density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)) remained unchanged and the high-density lipoprotein increased after 6-week KD treatment in normal weight men . Furthermore, KD shifts the low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle distribution to a larger size, resulting in significant increases in peak and mean low density lipoprotein (LDL) diameter and decrease in the proportion of small, dense low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles (Meckling et al., 2002; Sharman et al., 2002; Dashti et al., 2003; Volek et al., 2005), which is considered beneficial because small low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles are atherogenic. In fact, the majority of recent studies demonstrate that physiological ketosis can actually benefit the blood lipid profiles (Brehm et al., 2003; Shai et al., 2008; Volek et al., 2009).  There were several limitations in this study.",ae5883e0-725e-4b4b-bf99-e0642719a325
58,discussion12," First, in the in vitro study, BHB was used to mimic the KD in the in vivo study. KD was adopted in animals in order to achieve a prolonged neuroprotective state before ischemia. Although BHB is the major component of KBs and the most widely used ingredient in vitro, the possibility that the mice are also protected by components other than BHB can not be excluded, because KD has multiple ingredients. Second, we did not assess the effects of other KBs like acetoacetate in vitro, thus whether other KBs work in the same way as BHB remains still unclear. Further studies are needed to elucidate these issues.  Conclusion Our results indicate that KD or BHB can prevent NLRP3 inflammasome activation and thereby improve the brain ischemic tolerance. As summarized in Figure 10, KD or BHB may inhibit Drp1 mitochondrial translocation to protect mitochondrial morphology and function, which prevents reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",1848e1af-0551-4486-b149-b06bbb317027
59,discussion13," Further, BHB treatment may also ameliorate ER stress-associated NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Although prophylactic KD therapy is still not used in clinical settings, our findings confirm the neuroprotective effects of KD and provide evidence on the potential molecular mechanism underlying these effects, which support the potential clinical utility of KD as nutritional supply in acute cerebrovascular diseases.  Figure 10 The potential mechanistic pathway by which KD or BHB regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Ischemic damage causes Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission and ER stress. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production aggravates ER stress and induces thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 activation. The resultant maturation of IL-1β is responsible for the inflammation and cell apoptosis, leading to the central nervous system dysfunction.
