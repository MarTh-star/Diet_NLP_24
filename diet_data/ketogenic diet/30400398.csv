0,introduction0,"The ketogenic diet is a very low carbohydrate diet that has shown therapeutic benefits in drug resistant epilepsy (1, 2) and is gaining increased attention in other neurological diseases (3) and in healthy aging (4). Ketones (acetoacetate [AcAc] and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate [D-BHB]) are produced by the liver when blood glucose and insulin decrease (5). Blood ketones above 0.5 mM indicates a ketosis state that reaches 3–5 mM on the ketogenic diet. One of the main benefits of ketones is their ability to act as an alternative energy source to glucose or fatty acids for production of ATP by mitochondria. Caloric restriction and intermittent fasting also produce transient mild-moderate ketosis (6, 7).  As an alternative to the ketogenic diet, exogenous ketone precursors taken orally achieve mild ketosis in the absence of dietary restriction.",5922aaf2-10db-417b-821d-637ca6f78a82
1,introduction1," They can be grouped in three categories (Figure 1): First, medium chain triglycerides (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)) composed of a mixture of 8 and 10 carbons fatty acids are efficiently digested to free fatty acids (free fatty acids (FFA)), directly absorbed, and rapidly metabolized by the liver. The acute production of excess acetyl-CoA drives the production of AcAc and then D-BHB which are both secreted into the systemic circulation (8). While a high dose of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) can provide a moderate increase in blood ketones (+0.5–1.0 mM), gastrointestinal intolerance and high caloric load limit their use. Second, ketone esters (KE) made of a BHB ester linked to butanediol provide one molecule of D-BHB after digestion, with the butanediol being further metabolized by the liver to D-BHB (9). KE increase blood ketones above 1 mM but are also limited at high dose by their gastric tolerability and severe bitterness (10).",046bc33b-5dfa-44b1-b2d0-865c5b4ce124
2,introduction2," Third, perhaps the most physiologic way to raise blood ketones is via the oral intake of D-BHB itself. Exogenous D-BHB is directly absorbed into the circulation, with some of it being converted to AcAc by the liver, and both ketones being distributed throughout the body. Until recently, only racemic mixtures of dextro (D) and levo (L) BHB (D+L-BHB) were available and oral human studies with them have been reported (9, 11–14). As L-BHB is not metabolized significantly into energy intermediates and is slowly excreted in the urine (9, 15), D+L-BHB would be anticipated to be less ketogenic than pure D-BHB.  Figure 1 Exogenous production of blood ketones by three ketone precursors–medium chain triglycerides (MCT), KE, and D-BHB.  Once ketone precursors are absorbed and metabolized, the resulting ketones are taken up by extrahepatic tissues such as brain, heart, muscle, and kidney and metabolized to acetyl-CoA for ATP production in mitochondria (5).",c91006d2-cd8d-4931-a332-30d8fe670797
3,introduction3," Understanding how ketones are utilized by different organs after the intake of a ketone precursor is therefore starting to gain in importance. For instance, brain energy is derived mostly from glucose, but ketones spare brain glucose consumption when they are available (16). When blood ketone levels are increased (either by ketogenic diet or exogenous ketones), the brain utilizes ketones preferentially. Brain ketone metabolism is directly proportional to plasma ketone level over a wide concentration range. An increase in brain ketone metabolism can increase overall brain energy supply in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (17–19). The heart is an energy omnivore and uses both free fatty acids (FFA) and glucose as major energy substrates (20). Increased blood ketones produced by acute intravenous infusion of D+L-BHB reduces myocardial glucose utilization without affecting myocardial free fatty acids (FFA) metabolism (21).",7b00f4d3-eb5e-45ee-853b-21dae1c69ca3
4,introduction4," The kidney uses free fatty acids (FFA) as its main energy source (22) and, although less well-studied, ketones have been shown to be preferred over free fatty acids (FFA), lactate and other endogenous energy substrates for the kidney (23). Despite utilizing ~20% of total body energy intake, the liver cannot use ketones as a source of energy as it lacks the enzyme succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid-CoA transferase (succinyl CoA 3 oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT)) required to convert AcAc back to acetyl-CoA (3). However, the liver contributes to the interconversion of AcAc to D-BHB via mitochondrial D-BHB dehydrogenase (BDH1).  Positron-emission tomography (Positron emission tomography (PET)) using the ketone tracer, 11C-AcAc, was developed initially to directly observe ketone metabolism in the brain of people developing MCI and AD (24, 25). It has been used to study heart energy metabolism in rodents (26) and has the potential to provide insight into whole body ketone metabolism in humans.",cb26166d-b090-4996-ba4a-386fdb55f8f9
5,introduction5," Here, the objective was to compare the metabolism of a pure D-BHB oral supplement, i.e., the increase in blood D-BHB and AcAc after D-BHB, to that produced by the ingestion of the same amount of racemic D+L-BHB or medium chain triglycerides (MCT). A pilot study was also performed to assess the feasibility of using 11C-AcAc Positron emission tomography (PET) to observe organ ketone uptake after oral ingestion of D-BHB.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Canton de Vaud (Switzerland) under the generic protocol reference 2018-00503, and all participants provided written informed consent. Procedures were conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identification number NCT03603782.  Statistical Analysis The sample size was based on previous determination of the coefficient of variation of plasma BHB iAUC (SD/mean = 0.0783). With this assumption, in order to detect a 10% difference between the iAUC of two products with a power of 80% and a type 1 error rate of 5%, about 12 participants per group were needed in a complete cross over design frame.",b6da62b2-aaf7-4a51-88de-1e4b6ba13912

To assess a potential carry-over effect, the joint modeling of iAUC and half-life (T1/2) was estimated by including product taken, previous product taken, and interaction of product taken and previous product taken as covariates. The covariate-associated coefficients were not different from zero, supporting the assumption that product-related effects were not carried forward over visits.  Exploratory inferential results were obtained with the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum exact test (28). The alpha level was set at 0.05.

13,methods7,"  11C-AcAc Positron emission tomography (PET) Pilot Study The full method for the 11C-AcAc-Positron emission tomography (PET) tracer experiment has been reported previously (16, 17). On the day of the Positron emission tomography (PET) scan, prior to injecting the tracer 11C-AcAc at 0 min, a 66 year old healthy male (74 kg) fasted for ~6 h then consumed two servings of the D-BHB supplement at −75 min and again at −30 min.  Positron emission tomography (PET) images were acquired on a Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT (Gemini TF, Philips Healthcare, Eindhoven, the Netherlands). On the contralateral side from the radiotracer injection, blood was arterialized by warming the forearm with a heating pad at 44°C. Blood samples were taken at 3, 6, 8, 12, 20, and 28 min post-injection.  The acquisition protocol was as follows: 370 MBq of 11C-AcAc was injected followed by a 10-min dynamic brain acquisition, in list mode, with an isotropic voxel size of 2 mm3.",2c41c2cd-d291-4c1f-acb4-2de40851f835
14,methods8," Immediately after the dynamic brain acquisition, three whole-body (head to mid-thigh) acquisitions were performed at 18, 25, and 35 min post-injection. The acquisition times per bed position were 30, 45, and 60 s, respectively, for the three scans. Whole body acquisitions were performed with an isotropic voxel size of 4 mm3. Finally, an 8 frame per-cycle cardiac-gated acquisition of 15 min was performed 50 min after tracer injection.  Positron emission tomography (PET) tracer kinetics were analyzed for the brain (PMOD Technologies Ltd., Zurich, Switzerland). Brain ketone metabolism was assessed with graphical Patlak analysis of 11C-AcAc as previously described (16, 17). Briefly, Patlak linearization was used to quantify the brain uptake rate constants of acetoacetate (KAcAc) and the cerebral metabolic rate of AcAc and ketones (CMRAcAc and CMRketones).",bea9b4b0-fc9a-4b81-8f71-914460ccb2bd
15,methods9," CMR was calculated using the following equation: CMR = K × Cp/LC, where K (min−1) is the uptake rate constant, Cp is the arterial plasma concentration, and LC is the lumped constant (1.0 for AcAc) accounting for uptake differences between the tracer and natural molecule. CMRketones calculation uses the plasma concentrations of AcAc and D-BHB, KAcAc, and rk (KAcAc/ Kketones) set at 1.2 as previously reported (21, 22). CMRketones = (KAcAcx[AcAc]) × (1+(1/rkx[AcAc]/[D-BHB])).  To characterize the effect of D-BHB supplementation on ketone uptake in organs besides the brain, 11C-AcAc uptake by the liver, kidneys and heart were segmented on the whole-body Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT fusion image, and the % dose/g was calculated from the organ volume and injected dose.  Heart reorientation and cardiac function analysis were performed using the cardiac module of PMOD 3.9 to obtain the ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, and polar map (29).",d25076e6-eaec-4a6b-b6cc-80009ee51ff8

Analysis of blood D-BHB and AcAc revealed a similar pattern for the three products (Figures 2B,C). However, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) produced proportionally less blood AcAc and more blood D-BHB than oral D-BHB or D+L-BHB. The calculated ratio [mean AcAc iAUC/mean D-BHB iAUC] was 0.44 for medium chain triglycerides (MCT), a value ~30–40 % lower than for D-BHB (0.63) and D+L-BHB (0.76) (Supplementary Table 1; D-BHB vs. medium chain triglycerides (MCT) p = 0.0102; D+L-BHB vs. medium chain triglycerides (MCT) p < 0.0001; D+L-BHB vs. D-BHB p = 0.173). The baseline ratio AcAc/D-BHB was ~0.7, suggesting that medium chain triglycerides (MCT) lowered the AcAc/D-BHB blood ratio while producing ketones.",27ba479c-b6fd-4081-8df4-93105fa457ff
19,results2," Similar ratios were obtained when using values derived from Cmax [mean AcAc Cmax/mean D-BHB Cmax] (Supplementary Table 2).  As expected, oral intake of D+L-BHB resulted in a significant increase in plasma L-BHB over the first hour (Figure 2D), follow by a slow decrease over the next 3 h, without coming back to baseline. In comparison, oral intake of D-BHB did not produce an increase in plasma L-BHB.  Ketone production per calorie ingested [medium chain triglycerides (MCT): 8.3 kcal/g; BHB: 4.6 kcal/g (42)] was significantly higher for D-BHB than for D+L-BHB and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) (Figure 3B, p < 0.0001 for all three comparisons D-BHB vs. D+L BHB vs. medium chain triglycerides (MCT)). Increased glucose and insulin levels as a result of the intake of the meal 30 min after each test product was consumed were not significantly different across the three groups (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Figure 2).",113c72e6-55c4-47a4-940a-b2460e06889d

The first whole-body Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT biodistribution of 11C-AcAc 18 min post injection of the radiotracer is illustrated in Figure 4.

From the dynamic brain scan, CMRAcAc and KAcAc could be determined for all main regions of the brain (Supplementary Table 5) and compared to baseline values previously determined in healthy young adults (16). Overall and compared to baseline, each region demonstrated an increase in CMRAcAc and KAcAc of ~4.7 and 2.3-fold, respectively, about 1 h after taking D-BHB. This indicated that AcAc is effectively taken by the brain and by other organs particularly the heart and the kidney.  Despite the fact that a dynamic cardiac scan could not performed in the present study, assessment of cardiac function was still possible with the gated heart Positron emission tomography (PET) image (Figure 6).",10e4ce2f-7052-4ab9-a7f8-71ee52f7b84d

23,discussion0,"To our knowledge, this is the first report of the metabolism of D-BHB in humans and its link to the organ distribution of the ketone, AcAc, by Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. This study shows that D-BHB is rapidly absorbed and metabolized (Figure 2). It also increases blood ketones above 1 mM, a level ~1.7 fold greater than the same dose of D+L-BHB or medium chain triglycerides (MCT), and this despite the lower caloric load of D-BHB. Moreover, the results of the pilot whole body 11C-AcAc-Positron emission tomography (PET) experiment support the feasibility of this technique to measure organ-specific exogenous ketone utilization and they suggest that exogenous ketones are very actively utilized by the heart and kidney.  Ketone production from an exogenous dietary source has been traditionally achieved by medium chain triglycerides (MCT).",e74c19d8-7ac8-41b6-94dc-20d240a7af51
24,discussion1," This requires a bolus intake to saturate the liver with MCFA, producing excess acetyl-CoA which is then transformed to AcAc and BHB, which are released into systemic circulation. The Cmax achieved with medium chain triglycerides (MCT) is usually between 300 and 600 μM, with higher values being difficult to reach due to GI side effects and liver saturation. Here we show that D-BHB, a natural and biologically active ketone isomer, raises blood ketone Cmax above 1 mM without noticeable side effects. In comparison, an equivalent dose of D+L-BHB or medium chain triglycerides (MCT) only achieved half this ketone level, with similar Tmax at 1 h. Thus, compared to D+L-BHB, D-BHB significantly reduces the salt intake needed to achieve the same plasma ketone response.  Results from a previous study (9) comparing KE to D+L-BHB showed that at the same dose of D-BHB equivalent, the increase blood ketone iAUC had the same magnitude, suggesting that exogenous D-BHB and KE produce similar ketosis.",1df6791c-0f7f-4fdc-9c98-184217a96a25
25,discussion2," We note that the Tmax of D+L-BHB was significantly longer (~90 min) compared to KE (~20 min) at the same dose, suggesting that D-BHB could have a longer duration of action than KE. We also found that D+L-BHB resulted in a significant increase of plasma L-BHB that eliminate slowly, consistent with a previous report (9) and indicating a difference in the metabolic utilization of D and L-BHB. While D-BHB is readily utilized as an energy source, the L-isoform is eliminated slowly in the urine and does not contribute significantly to the biological activity of ketone precursors as an energy source. Finally, D-BHB provided higher ketones per calorie consumed than medium chain triglycerides (MCT): the caloric density of D-BHB (4.6 kcal/g) is half that of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) (8.2 kcal/g), making D-BHB a 2.6 fold more energetically efficient ketone precursor vs. medium chain triglycerides (MCT) (based on iAUC over 4 h).",e55596f7-dada-47d6-9c0c-7bf8c86bbe3f
26,discussion3,"  The present study also revealed that D-BHB conversion to AcAc provided a ~43% higher AcAc/D-BHB blood ratio (0.63) than the same dose of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) (0.44). In this respect, KE seems to behave more like medium chain triglycerides (MCT), with a ratio around 0.2–0.4 (3), while on the ketogenic diet, this ratio remains unchanged around 0.5 (16). Since D-BHB needs to be converted to AcAc by BDH-1 within each organ before being metabolized to acetyl-CoA (3), a higher AcAc/D-BHB ratio could be energetically more effective. Moreover, as this conversion requires the co-factor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), to be reduced to NADH, a higher AcAc/D-BHB might better preserve the mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio.",4dc30912-80b9-4f2b-9efb-52c628002f78
27,discussion4," Interestingly, a higher NAD+/NADH ratio has been associated to better health (30, 31), and can be increased in the brain by nutritional ketosis (32, 33), suggesting that D-BHB might be superior to medium chain triglycerides (MCT) or KE in this respect, a point meriting further investigation.  Positron emission tomography (PET) has been invaluable in measuring energy metabolism at the organ level in humans. For example, with 18F-FDG, it clearly shows that glucose is the main energy substrate of the brain and that a fatty acid such as 11C-palmitate is preferentially utilized by the heart and the liver (34, 35). Our pilot 11C-AcAc-Positron emission tomography (PET) experiment aimed simply to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring ketone uptake by the main organs when exogenous D-BHB is administered orally to humans.",a6242fc3-9d1b-4c26-8c7c-2e97b0beba3c
28,discussion5," The key advantage of 11C-AcAc as a metabolic radiotracer is that it equilibrates rapidly with D-BHB in blood and is indistinguishable from endogenous AcAc, so reflects the actual metabolism of ketones. The whole-body scan revealed for the first time that the heart and kidney are major contributors to the metabolism of exogenous AcAc after ingestion of a D-BHB supplement.  Most of the heart's energy requirement is normally provided by fatty acids and glucose (20). Our results confirm that the heart has the capacity to utilize other substrates such as ketones (21) and that ketone metabolism appears to be linked to the metabolism and clearance of the radiotracer by the myocardium. On a per gram basis, the kidney consumes a large amount of energy mostly derived from fatty acids, but our data show that ketones can clearly also be used effectively for mitochondrial respiration in the kidney as well.  The cerebral metabolic rate for ketones (CMRketones) obtained here with D-BHB (3.",0a729349-62a3-4d23-9eaf-ab01222a7fb6
29,discussion6,"0 μmol/100 g/min) exceeded that obtained after medium chain triglycerides (MCT) supplementation in mild cognitive impairment [2.49 μmol/100 g/min; (17)] and Alzheimer's disease [1.9–2.0 μmol/100 g/min; (18)]. While the CMR values obtained here for D-BHB are preliminary, our data suggest that a D-BHB supplement represents a promising intervention to provide ketones that can rescue the brain energy glucose deficit in these conditions (17, 25).  11C-AcAc uptake by the liver (Figures 4, 5) could reflect both the conversion of 11C-AcAc to 11C-D-BHB by BHD-1 and the high blood reservoir capacity of the liver, but do not reflect ketone metabolism by the liver itself. We show here that the blood radioactivity values of 11C-AcAc were similar to those of the liver (see Figure 5) supporting the view that the liver produces but does not metabolize ketones (5).",2806073c-ccd3-4ca1-95c5-c55a20442ef6
30,discussion7," This is consistent with the liver radioactivity after 11C-AcAc infusion being due to blood and not to the conversion of AcAc into AcAc-CoA and other energy intermediates (5).  Recent studies have shown the potential importance of ketones in cardio-metabolic health. Infusion of D+L-BHB has beneficial hemodynamic effects in adult patients with heart failure and lower ejection fraction (36). In children with fatty acid oxidation defects such as multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, D+L-BHB improved heart function and cognitive performance, which resulted in better walking ability and correction of neurological symptoms (37). Moreover, clinical trials in diabetes with sodium/glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, which increase plasma ketones (38), show markedly reduced risk of cardiovascular events and kidney failure (39).",dd1f0d11-6f2b-4ecc-bdf4-8b4635bed6c8
31,discussion8," Given the significant dysregulation of energy metabolism in type 2 diabetes, it is plausible that part of the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart and kidney is mediated via improved ATP production using ketones as an alternative energy fuel to fatty acid and glucose (38, 40). This opens additional opportunities for therapeutic exploration of D-BHB supplements beyond energy rescue of the brain.  This study has several limitations. First, the pharmacokinetic comparison of D-BHB, D+L-BHB and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) was an acute, single 4 h study; the extent to which it reflects long-term differences in their metabolism remains to be determined. Second, the whole-body Positron emission tomography (PET) scan was done on a single person and (except for brain) was a semi-quantitative comparison across organs. The brain was chosen for the quantitative scan (CMRAcAc).",1daebcc9-14dc-4570-ad88-01fa9766131b
32,discussion9," Dynamic Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is required in order to quantify the tracer uptake and cannot be done simultaneously on the brain as well as other organs. Cardiac gated image quality could be improved if the image was acquired sooner after tracer injection. Third, ketone production and metabolism vary depending on post-prandial metabolic status, which possibly influences organ ketone distribution. Hence, follow-up of this single observation under different feeding conditions will be needed to verify the relative differences across organs.  Conclusions D-BHB appears to be a promising supplement to produce significantly higher blood ketones than D+L-BHB or medium chain triglycerides (MCT), and at a lower calorie intake for an equivalent dose.",aa2931c6-8925-41e1-8385-c9a1c24409d5
33,discussion10," Moreover, exogenous D-BHB does not appear to lower the blood AcAc/D-BHB ratio, which, altogether, might make it a more effective “super fuel” compared to other ketone precursors such as medium chain triglycerides (MCT), D+L-BHB or KE.  The pilot 11C-AcAc-Positron emission tomography (PET) study clearly identifies the heart and kidney as significant consumers of exogenous ketones, in fact, more than the brain. Therefore, D-BHB supplementation could be tested in conditions such as heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy to improve cardiac energy efficiency and function, and in chronic kidney disease.
