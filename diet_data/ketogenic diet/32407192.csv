10,discussion0," The human gut contains a complex community of microbes that have a pivotal role in human health. It is estimated to contain around 1000 bacterial species and 100 times more genes than the human genome (27). This community of microbes is often referred to as a “hidden metabolic organ” because of its enormous influence on host metabolism, physiology, nutrition, and immune function (28).  Any dietary changes (e.g., FODMAPs, gluten free or very low calorie diet (VLCD)s), despite showing beneficial effects, can affect microbiota composition, especially when protracted for a long time (29).  During a weight loss program, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes increased and the abundance of Firmicutes decreased irrespective of diet type as long as the person lost at least 6% of their body weight (20, 25).",089ff5c7-5cc3-4bcd-abb9-eba349e9c7d7
11,discussion1,"  VLCarbDs and very low calorie diet (VLCD)s appeared to reduce the abundance of just a few groups of bacteria with health benefits, and they were also associated with increased proportions of others, such as A. municiphila and Christensenella. The increased proportions of bacteria, such as Akkermansia and Christensenella, induced by a low-calorie intake, represents an intriguing example of host-microbe co-evolution that would appear to benefit both partners (6, 30, 31). Akkermansia muciniphila is inversely correlated with disease status (32). Akkermansia muciniphila, is a mucin-degrading bacterium that resides in the mucus layer. The presence of this bacterium inversely correlates with body weight in rodents and humans. However, the precise physiological roles played by this bacterium during obesity and metabolic disorders are unknown (33).",8bec9a41-7cd9-422e-b741-b01d6794bc77
12,discussion2,"  Low carbohydrates intake in very low energy diet (very low calorie diet (VLCD) (VLED)) reduced substrates available for Bifidobacteria and bacteria within the Lactobacillus group in the large intestine, while the high content of protein contributed to Bacteroides spp increase (18), the predominant proteolytic species identified in the human large intestine (34). In maintenance phase, at the end of very low calorie diet (VLCD) (VLED), Bifidobacteria and bacteria within the Lactobacillus group start to increase again suggesting that change is transient. Drastic dietary changes in very low calorie diet (VLCD) (VLED) leads so to Bacteroides spp. increase and to Bifidobacteria decrease, reflecting that bacteria flora modifications are associated with dietary intake rather the body weight variations (18).  Duncan et al. investigated the effects on gut microbiota of two diets, high-protein low carbohydrate, ketogenic (LC) and high-protein moderate-carbohydrate, non-ketogenic (MC).",143bb8a7-15c7-4587-a507-db9dc70208d8
13,discussion3," Impact of each diet on gut microbiota was very different: particularly the LC diet led to decrease of Firmicutes (Roseburia and Eubacterium rectale) some of which are responsible for butyrate production (26).  Similarly, Russell et al. observed that the populations of the butyrate producing Roseburia/E. rectale group of bacteria decreased markedly with the high protein and low carbohydrate (H et al 2007 (24) Randomized trial VLCarbD (HPLC)) normocaloric diet. The abundance of another group of butyrate producers is maintained, which are related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (35). This group may have become the main supplier of butyrate in the intestine with this diet. Butyrate is the main source of energy for the colon cells; therefore, it allows cells to replicate and function normally, avoiding the apoptosis. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii exercises beneficial anti-inflammatory effects on the intestinal mucosa (36) and it is believed to have a positive influence on colon health (35).",fcb2bba5-82c7-41b5-94bd-f37b09e86c8d
14,discussion4,"  The bacteria that are most affected by the decrease in carbohydrate intake are E. rectale and Roseburia while F. prausnitzii seems to be less affected by the decrease in carbohydrates in the diet. Duncan et al., monitored dietary effect shift from normal intakes of carbohydrate (399g/day) to either moderate (164g/day) or low (24g/day) intakes in a weight loss program for obese individuals, showing a E. rectale and Roseburia spp. marked progressive decrease with reduction of carbohydrate intake (24).  Roseburia and E. rectale belong to the Firmicutes phylum and they are part of the commensal bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids (short chain fatty acids (SCFA)), in particular butyrate, which influence colon motility, immunity maintenance and anti-inflammatory properties. Changes in the presence of Roseburia can lead to the development of various diseases (including irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, type 2 diabetes, nervous system conditions and allergies) (37).",c4256412-6ad2-4e18-a9ce-58658ffb5245
15,discussion5,"  Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, an anerobic bacterium belonging to the Firmicutes phylum, is a key component of the gut microbiota and the most abundant butyrate-producing bacterium in the human colon (38). It accounts for approximately 5% of all detectable bacteria in stool samples from healthy adults (39). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is best known as a biomarker for human health, as decreased levels have been associated with increased inflammatory activity and may trigger certain diseases such as colorectal cancer (38). Reduced numbers have been reported in inflammatory bowel disease and infectious colitis, and Furet et al. (40) showed that this species might also play a role in low-grade inflammatory disorders such as obesity and diabetes. The authors also observed a relationship between F. prausnitzii and inflammatory markers in both non-diabetic and diabetic obese patients, even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI).",be1960ca-e30c-43d7-bf10-c2a5551a714b
16,discussion6," Faecalibacterium prausnitzii proportions were smaller in those patients with type 2 diabetes presenting higher levels of low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. A negative association was also seen between F. prausnitzii and insulin resistance assessed using the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA IR), possibly attributable to an improvement in glucose metabolism in the diabetic group (40).  In contrast to the previous studies, Aleman et al., observed that during a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) the increased lipolysis leaded to production of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body that is also a short chain fatty acid byproduct, that resulted negatively correlated with F. prausnitzii and genus Roseburia. The increase of BHB levels could results from less catabolism by F. prausnitzii and Roseburia (21).  Further studies on very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) were carried out between 2019 and 2021. Guiterrez Repiso et al.",12120fd5-d5d9-4ca5-a881-8966a4bb2544
17,discussion7," revealed that the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) program not alter the gut microbial population and that the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio correlates significantly with the percentage of weight loss (23). very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) positively changes the microbiota but this change is greater if probiotics and prebiotics are supplemented during the diet (23).  A recent study by Basciani et al. showed that the microbiota is sensitive to the type of proteins of the diet. Patients were administered with a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD)s with whey, vegetable or animal proteins; the relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly decreased while Bacteroidetes increased proportionally with the only exception in the vegetable protein group in which the increase in Bacteroidetes not reached statistical significance suggesting that the origin of proteins may influence the microbiota change (20).  More recently Guitérrez-Repiso et al.",e95ac6ac-6930-4779-926f-c93f8073a902
18,discussion8," compared the effects on the intestinal microbiota in patients following the Mediterranean diet (MetDiet), very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), and who underwent bariatric surgery (BS) (22).  In patients administered with very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) there was a significant increase in Alistipes (Rikenellaceae family) while a decrease in Lactobacillus was recorded. There was also a decrease in Orodibacter splanchnicus and there was an increase of Parabacteroides. Alistipes and Parabacteroides were negatively associated with waistline and body mass index in adults (41) and young people (42).  The gut microbiota is a very dynamic entity influenced by nutritional behaviors (43). The composition of the gut microbiota differs in obese and lean subjects, suggesting that microbiota dysbiosis can contribute to changes in body weight (44).",33bc2b11-f99e-4d77-b00e-4b4b5ad6ef27
19,discussion9," While nutritional status (normal weight, overweight) is known to influence the microbial population, there are also studies that have evaluated the influence of the changes in microbiota on the pathways related to obesity and weight loss. In fact, the Firmicutes phylum has been shown to be negatively correlated with the resting energy expenditure (resting energy expenditure (REE)) as well as positively correlated with fat mass percentage (45). Moreover, a 20% increase in the Firmicutes phylum abundance was associated with an increase of 150 kcal in energy harvest (46). On the other hand, a decrease in the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio after a weight loss program also was observed, and the Bacteroidetes proportion was positively correlated with a percentage of loss of body fat (25).",50c4aa54-3bb5-4683-977c-6e72c5e9de84
20,discussion10," In addition, it was observed that the persistent success after a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) (no weight recover in the following 2 years) was associated with the microbiota; the Alistipes, a Bacteroidetes member of Rikenellaceae family was associated with program success, while Prevotella abundance was associated with less success (24).  Several papers investigated the gut microbiota correlation with diet and weight loss, but studies on the effects of specific very low calorie diet (VLCD)s, very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD)s and VLCarbDs on the microbiota are scarce and the results are controversial. The strength of the study is to selectively investigate the available literature on the effect of carbohydrate-restricted diet (very low calorie diet (VLCD)s, very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD)s and VLCarbDs) on the changes in the intestinal microbiota.",069473db-0d5f-441b-8a0f-dc4aeffdbf34
21,discussion11,"  Conclusions  Although very few studies have analyzed the effects of VLCarbDs and very low calorie diet (VLCD)s on gut microbiota, significant diet-induced changes in fecal microbiota composition have been observed.
