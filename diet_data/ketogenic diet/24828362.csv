0,introduction0,"Twenty-eight million people worldwide suffer diminished vision from diabetic retinopathy.[1] Additionally, obesity leads to other ocular complications including macular degeneration, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts.[2] These maladies of the eye are destined to increase as the prevalence of obesity increases in developed and developing countries. Although the association between metabolic disorders and ocular health are well established, in many such associations causality has not been established and mechanisms of pathogenesis remain to be determined. While it has been assumed that metabolic disorders cause ocular disease, one must consider the possibility that, in some cases, ocular disease may lead to systemic metabolic dysfunction. To test this possibility, we subjected a mouse model lacking a retinal photopigment to a robust dietary challenge and evaluated whole body metabolism.   Opn4 -/- mice lack the photopigment melanopsin.",7cf5c23b-a905-4b49-8a1c-a12e7399d26d
1,introduction1,"[3] This photopigment renders a subset of retinal ganglion cells directly sensitive to light.[4] These intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) play a critical role in nonvisual, non-image forming (non image forming (NIF)) responses to light, such as the pupillary light reflex and circadian photoentrainment.[5] Most non image forming (NIF) responses are mediated through autonomic innervation. The photic regulation of the pineal’s production of melatonin is exclusively sympathetic.[6, 7] Dynamic control of pupillary aperture employs antagonistic influences from the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the autonomic nervous system.[8] Presumably, the acute increases observed in heart rate and body temperature in response to light are also autonomically controlled.",2748c8a1-b58d-4913-ae2c-01ce8fb01d58
2,introduction2,"[9] The prominent regulatory function of ipRGCs in these diverse autonomic responses suggests that ipRGCs may play a broader role in autonomic physiology, perhaps even mediating light’s effect on general sympathetic tone.  Metabolism is also autonomically regulated. Although lipolysis in white adipose tissue (white adipose tissue (WAT)) is controlled through humoral signals such as adipokines, insulin, and adrenal cathecholamines, within the past decade it has become increasingly clear that sympathetic innervation of white adipose tissue (WAT) depots also plays a significant role in regulating lipolysis.[10] For example, the switch from carbohydrate to triglyceride metabolism in response to fasting is sympathetically regulated.[11] Because the non image forming (NIF) photoreceptive system regulates other autonomically driven responses, we tested whether impairment of ipRGCs, which mediate most non image forming (NIF) responses to light, impacts metabolism.",0729bbe4-5b24-4c40-9409-d6a7e4bd1b4f
3,introduction3," To this end, we analyzed the metabolic phenotype of Opn4 -/- mice maintained on a ketogenic diet, a robust dietary challenge that minimizes carbohydrate and protein intake. Because rod and cone pathways also indirectly signal through ipRGCs, mice lacking rods and cones (Pde6b rd1/rd1), melanopsin-null mice lacking rods and cones (Opn4 -/;Pde6b rd1/rd1), and wild-type mice were also challenged and assessed.

4,methods0,"Animals Experimental animals were adult male mice, 70–84 days old at the beginning of the experiments. Animals were derived either from an in-house breeding colony at the University of Virginia or purchased from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME). The following genotypes were used: Opn4 -/- (mice null for melanopsin), [3], Pde6b rd1/rd1 (mice homozygous for the rd1 allele of the gene encoding the β-subunit of rod-specific phosphodiesterase which results in the degeneration of rods and cones)[12, 13], Opn4 -/; Pde6b rd1/rd1 (a cross of the two aforementioned genotypes), and wild-type controls. All genotypes were congenic on the C57BL6/J background. Prior to experimentation, mice were maintained in standard animal housing conditions, under a 12h:12h light:dark cycle and fed standard chow (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI; catalog # 8664) ad libitum.

6,methods2,"  The irradiance of the blue (peak wavelength 468 nm, 20 nm half-peak bandwidth) or red (peak wavelength 635 nm, 20 nm half-peak bandwidth) portions of the light cycles were adjusted, through the use of neutral density filters (Lee Filters, Burbank, CA), to 3 x 1011 photons•s-1•cm-2, as measured at the center of each cage. While in light-tight boxes, animals were provided with water and a ketogenic diet (Bioserv, Frenchtown, NJ; catalog # F3666) ad libitum. The composition of the diet was 78.9% fat, 9.5% protein, and 0.76% carbohydrate and supplemented by the vendor with a vitamin and mineral mix to provide a diet complete in micronutrients. Mice were weighed every other day, and weight change was calculated as a percentage of the animal’s initial weight (weight on day 1).

10,results0,"Light Condition and Genotype Affect Weight Change Upon a Dietary Challenge In mice fed a ketogenic diet (KD), we observed significant effects of light condition (p = 0.0056) and genotype (p<0.0001) on weight change (Figs 1 and 2) by RM-ANOVA. Opn4 -/- mice exhibited greater weight loss than WT mice over the course of 5 weeks in blue or red LD conditions (Fig 1A and 1B), and in the dark (Fig 2C). This result indicates that loss of melanopsin is linked to a weight loss phenotype in Opn4 -/- mice on a C57BL6/J background. Opn4 -/- mice not only lose more weight, but they also do not exhibit the weight change pattern seen in WT mice. WT mice in response to a KD typically lose weight, much of which is likely to be glycogen-associated water. [14, 15] However, in contrast to Opn4 -/- mice, they gain back a portion of that weight after about two weeks of the dietary challenge, reaching equilibrium at a slightly lesser weight than the pre-challenge weight.  10.1371/journal.pone.0127031.",437c2234-5ab9-4b7e-a14b-004d2a9adde2
11,results2," Several genotypes and light groups demonstrate pronounced differences in the second half of the experiment. Overall analysis indicates Opn4 -/- mice are significantly different in their weight change pattern than WTs (p<0.0001), but they are also different from Opn4 -/; Pde6 rd1/rd1 animals (p<0.05). Red LD condition causes more weight change than constant darkness over 5 weeks on the ketogenic diet challenge (p<0.01).

The Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test on general genotype effects over the entire 5 weeks of experiments revealed not only a significant difference between Opn4 -/- mice and their WT controls (p<0.",4e0742f7-fc9e-4d16-92ac-b836ea42f3e8
13,results4,"0001), but also between Opn4 -/- mice and the Opn4 -/; Pde6b rd1/rd1 animals (p = 0.0211) (Fig 2). The latter difference suggests a rescue of the extreme weight loss phenotype by the loss of rods and cones in the retina, and will be discussed further. Among all genotypes, weight change patterns are significantly different between red LD and constant darkness (p = 0.0040), whereas there is no difference between blue LD and constant darkness (Fig 2B and 2C). Constant darkness represents one condition where animals lose less weight than in other light conditions. In effect, constant darkness appears to confer partial protection against the dietary challenge.  Initial Differences in Weight Change Patterns Become Exaggerated Over Time Light (p<0.0001) and genotype (p<0.0001) are both highly significantly affecting weight change over time. Fig 1 reveals a difference in the profiles of weight change, especially during the second phase of the dietary challenge when WT animals stabilize.",0c2329c0-014d-4d6d-b906-b32b3fbb5d2f
14,results5," Due to this difference in weight loss profiles of the light and genotype interaction, we compared groups at regular time intervals over the five weeks course of the experiments. Specifically, all groups were compared to each other by the end of each week.  Consistent with the fact that the Opn4 -/- mice do not stabilize their weight after two weeks on the KD, the difference between Opn4 -/- mice and WT controls becomes significant as early as the end of the second week under blue LD (p = 0.0002; Figs 1A and 2A) and under red LD (p = 0.0009; Figs 1B and 2B), and continues to be so until the end of week five, in both red and blue LD conditions (week 3: p = 0.0001 in blue LD, p = 0.0003 in red LD; weeks 4 and 5: p<0.0001 in both blue and red LD). Opn4 -/- mice differ from WT mice in the dark by the end of fourth (p = 0.0016) and fifth (p = 0.0002) weeks, indicating a strong genotype effect independent of light exposure (Fig 2C).",0382ad0c-b2b5-4e74-86f2-5557ed10c0d0

The end of 5th week is also when Pde6b rd1/rd1 mice differ from Opn4 -/- mice in red light (p = 0.0002) (Fig 2B).  According to this week by week analysis, the only specific time where a significant difference is seen between light conditions is by the end of week 5, between Opn4 -/- mice in red LD and constant dark (p = 0.0004) (Fig 2B and 2C) (Note that for all weekly comparisons, alpha value has been adjusted to 0.0017—Dunn-Sidak correction for contrasts).

Body temperatures of Opn4 -/- mice were similar before and after the consumption of the KD in either a red or blue LD cycle (Fig 4E). This was also the case in WT mice. Taken together, these results indicate that the weight change differences observed between the genotypes are not due to variations in body temperature or an inability to synchronize with the environmental light-dark cycle.

20,results11," The extreme weight loss phenotype observed in Opn4 -/- mice is not due to food consumption (Fig 5A), changes in activity (Fig 5C), metabolic rate (Fig 5D) or heat production (Fig 5F). Opn4 -/- mice were also not generating excess amounts of heat. In addition, all groups consumed equivalent amounts of the KD, and showed similar metabolic rates. Respiratory exchange ratios also did not differ between groups. To summarize, the excessive weight loss observed in Opn4 -/- mice could not be attributed to any changes in the metabolic parameters of the animals. Although this seems to be an unexpected phenotype for the Opn4 -/- mice, it must be noted that due to technical reasons, the metabolic experiments could only capture an early (during the first two weeks of KD) and short (3 days) time window of KD challenge, which lasted for five weeks in the actual weight loss study.",2f375ca7-6461-4a3b-bddd-85c590a5866a

23,discussion0,"It is difficult to conceive how a mutation that eliminates a retinal photopigment can produce such a profound whole-body metabolic phenotype in response to dietary challenge. The observed differences in body weight could be a consequence of differences between the genotypes in caloric intake or caloric expenditure. However, we observed no difference in food consumption or activity levels between genotypes or among the different lighting conditions (Fig 5A and 5C). Additionally, none of the metabolic metrics showed any differences between the melanopsin-null and wild-type mice (Fig 5). We assessed metabolic parameters immediately upon challenging the animals with the ketogenic diet. The weight loss phenotype is manifested after approximately three days on the ketogenic diet, however, potential metabolic differences may become apparent only after several days of dietary challenge.  Connections are emerging between circadian dysfunction and metabolic pathology.",b9d3c1a5-20f2-42a6-9328-9fc9a244da58
24,discussion1,"[16] Because melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs play a role in synchronizing circadian rhythms to the astronomical day, the metabolic phenotype could arise from an insufficiency in photoentrainment. However, we observed no differences in diurnal rhythms of activity or body temperature among our experimental groups (Fig 5), so the root cause of the phenotype remains unknown.  A photopigment deficit suggests that the diet-induced phenotype would be light dependent. For this reason, we analyzed our animals under blue:dark or red:dark LD cycles. Because melanopsin is optimally sensitive to blue light relative to red light, we would expect to see light dependent effects vary as a function of spectra. While we observe a more robust phenotype in animals maintained under red:dark light cycles vs. blue:dark light cycles, as would be expected in mice lacking the blue-sensitive melanopsin photopigment, the weight loss phenotype is also observed in animals maintained under constant darkness.",1a6a5b46-8005-495d-8e48-139d566a6f24
25,discussion2," Accordingly, we have concluded that the phenotype is derived from light-dependent effects revealed by our light treatments and light-independent effects of genotype (Fig 1).  How can a partially light-independent phenotype arise from a photopigment mutation? There are several possibilities. In the postnatal retina, melanopsin-driven photoresponses in ipRGCs occur before rod and cone responses develop.[17] ipRGC signaling is not only critical for the proper development and wiring of the retina, but also mediates a fetal light response that regulates eye development.[18, 19] Melanopsin is also required for forming proper connections to central retinorecipient sites.[20] We postulate that loss of melanopsin may interfere with proper light-dependent retinal innervation of hypothalamic targets, especially those implicated in energy homeostasis.",98f29f86-6364-4b99-ba7c-700988850a0d
26,discussion3," However, the aberrant circuitry laid down in a light-dependent manner during neonatal development may cause homeostatic differences in basal metabolic rates that are light-independent in the adult.  An alternate hypothesis is that melanopsin is functioning as sensor for something other than light, perhaps nutrients. Drosophila rhodopsin can function as a thermoreceptor in a light-independent manner.[21] Interestingly, flies null for rhodopsin that exhibit deficient thermosensitivity can be rescued by targeting expression of melanopsin to the omatidial photoreceptors. In our studies, wild-type mice appear to sense the dietary challenge and then adapt metabolically to preserve body weight. By contrast, melanopsin-null mice fail to adapt to the dietary challenge, suggesting the ketogenic insult is going undetected, thereby resulting in no metabolic accommodation.",f4eb28c3-3f06-4531-8dae-0ddb868d9bc3
27,discussion4," If melanopsin were playing a nonphotic function as a nutrient sensor necessary for metabolic adaptation, then melanopsin-null mice would exhibit the weight loss phenotype we observe.  A third hypothesis is that the deletion at the melanopsin locus is potentially altering expression of a metabolic gene in the same genomic region, either by direct gene-deletion or modification of a critical enhancer element. However, it should be noted that there are no known metabolic genes or enhancer/repressor elements near the modified locus. Additionally, Opn4 -/; Pde6b rd1/rd1 animals exhibit a rescue phenotype over the Opn4 -/- mice. Taken together, it seems unlikely that the observed phenotype is an epiphenomenon of the targeted gene deletion.  The mechanism responsible for the weight loss phenotype in melanopsin-deficient mice remains unknown. It is accepted that the autonomic nervous system exerts partial control over adiposity of fat depots.",a574367a-65d2-453f-9488-a053b3584861
28,discussion5," We propose that the visual photoreceptors (rods and cones) and the ipRGCs antagonistically influence the autonomic nervous system, either acutely, resulting in the observed light-dependent effects, or during development, resulting in our observed light-independent weight loss pattern. This model is based on the surprising observation that elimination of the visual photoreceptors, as is the case in Pde6b rd1/rd1 mice, rescues the weight-loss phenotype experienced by melanopsin-null mice. (Fig 2) Further studies are needed to test this proposed “push-pull” model.  We have shown that mice deficient in the retinal photopigment melanopsin exhibit extreme weight loss when challenged with a ketogenic diet. It has been reported that C57BL6/J mice maintained on a KD lose lean mass but protect white adipose tissue stores.",213524f4-85f8-4b48-baed-150ec51a4f56
29,discussion6,"[22] The difference observed in body mass between our wild-type and melanopsin-null mice may arise from a difference in fat metabolism, where wild-type mice lose lean mass while Opn4 -/- mice lose fat mass in addition to lean mass. Body composition studies are underway to address this possibility.  Ketogenic diets have been used to treat refractory epilepsy in children, and many popular low-carbohydrate diets are ketogenic during the initial induction phase. Because of the popularity of such diets, understanding the consequences of such dietary challenge, especially in those who suffer from retinal disease, is critical. Our study is a first step toward this goal.  We thank Mark Rollag, Chris Deppmann, and Erin Griner for their helpful advice on experimental design and data interpretation.
