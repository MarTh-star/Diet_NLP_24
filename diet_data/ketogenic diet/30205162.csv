0,introduction0,"Consumption of low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)s) has been shown to have diverse beneficial effects in promoting health and alleviating pathologic conditions. For example, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)s exhibit antiepileptic effects,1 promote weight loss in obesity,2 and enhance control of type 2 diabetes mellitus.3 low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)s also reportedly have beneficial effects in patients with autism,4 cardiomyopathy,5 neurodegenerative diseases,1 and cancer.6 The effective and safe use of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)s based on scientific evidence has contributed to both health promotion and disease treatment; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)s in vivo remain largely unknown.",7a2b7daf-f548-42d0-9721-ae28a6119ca1
1,introduction1,"  As a clinical trial demonstrated that restricting carbohydrate intake can reduce intrahepatic triglyceride levels,7 increased research attention has focused on the use of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)s in treating liver steatosis.8 However, children with epilepsy have been shown to develop liver steatosis with long-term consumption of a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD);9 thus, careful investigation of this effect is needed. A number of studies using rodent models have analyzed the role of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)s in the development of liver steatosis.10–16 Most of these studies used a common low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) for rodents (Bio-Serv F3666),10–13,15,16 with subsequent development of steatosis observed in the liver of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice.",7e4d172a-084c-4197-8640-05bf7665d1c6
2,introduction2,"10–12,16 However, surprisingly, we found that the F3666 diet had a dramatic preventative effect on the progression of liver steatosis in juvenile leptin-deficient obese (ob/ob) mice.13 We found that the underlying mechanism involves suppression of de novo triglyceride synthesis.13,16 This low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) also suppresses de novo triglyceride synthesis in C57BL/6J (wild-type) mice that develop liver steatosis.10–12,16 These conflicting results suggest that the beneficial effect of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) on liver steatosis in ob/ob mice is regulated by an as yet unknown mechanism that is non-functional in wild-type mice.",73a40f96-ae1d-4e76-ab27-7ec6d80f032c
3,introduction3,"  To clarify the underlying mechanism of these effects, we analyzed several molecular parameters in the liver of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed ob/ob mice and found a novel effect of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) in up-regulating expression of the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R)) in the liver. Although this receptor is expressed only minimally in the liver,17 low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) feeding significantly up-regulated very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R) expression in the liver of ob/ob and wild-type mice. Further analyses showed that very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride levels were significantly lower in the serum of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed wild-type mice.",62d27aaf-c700-4b33-a95c-dde6975676f9
4,introduction4," In addition, serum activity of lipoprotein lipase (lipoprotein lipase (LPL)), which mediates triglyceride uptake from very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) into extrahepatic tissues,18 was also down-regulated. In contrast, marked release of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglycerides was observed in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed ob/ob mice, whereas lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was maintained. These alterations in both strains were correlated with the conflicting liver steatosis phenotypes.  The results of our study suggest that the transport of triglycerides via very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) from the liver to extrahepatic tissues is inhibited by low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-induced hepatic very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R) up-regulation under low lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, whereas this inhibition of triglyceride transport is rescued under conditions of leptin deficiency.

10,results0,"Characterization of liver phenotypes in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice Wild-type and ob/ob mice of the inbred strain C57BL/6J were used in this study and fed the Bio-Serv F3666 low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). F3666 is a very-low-carbohydrate, low-protein, high-fat ketogenic diet developed to induce efficient production of ketone bodies in rodents.19 In ob/ob mutant mice fed a diet of regular chow, hyperglycemia typically develops at ~10 weeks of age.20 Our initial goal was to reverse this phenotype via feeding mice the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and analyze the diet’s effects on tissues at the molecular level. The mice were fed the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) over the period 5–12 weeks of age in the dietary experiment.13 We found that the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) feeding effectively reversed the hyperglycemic phenotype in female ob/ob mice during this period and therefore employed these conditions in subsequent experiments.",68f7a3df-c5b2-4bc8-bb4b-4e181af4ee83
11,results1,"13 The average blood glucose levels during the experimental period were as follows: chow-fed ob/ob mice, 194.30 ± 43.78 mg dl−1; low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed ob/ob mice, 106.96 ± 26.41 mg dl−1; chow-fed wild-type mice, 154.08 ± 20.55 mg dl−1; and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed wild-type mice, 114.30 ± 15.05 mg dl−1. Production of ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate) was observed in both the ob/ob and wild-type mice.13,16,21  Figure 1a shows the morphology of the liver after 7 weeks of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) feeding. In ob/ob mice, regular chow promoted significant steatosis associated with enlargement of the liver (left panel). Liver weight and total amount of triglycerides increased by more than 2-fold compared to values prior to the start of the experiment (Fig. 1b). The low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) is known to inhibit the progression of liver steatosis in ob/ob mice.",4b3f9dae-fb35-4fdc-998c-af1e092cdb22
12,results2,"13 Compared to chow-fed mice, the liver weight and total amount of triglycerides decreased by at least 70% in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice (Fig. 1b). The average triglycerides (mg) to liver weight (g) ratios were as follows: chow-fed ob/ob mice, 65.75 ± 24.7 mg g−1; and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed ob/ob mice, 48.79 ± 16.93 mg g−1. In contrast, the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) strongly promoted steatosis in wild-type mice. In low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed wild-type mice, the total amount of triglycerides in the liver has been shown to increase by more than 3-fold.16 Although liver weight remained unchanged in the present study, the organ became discolored as a result of excessive triglyceride accumulation (Fig. 1a, right panel). The average triglycerides (mg) to liver weight (g) ratios were as follows: chow-fed wild-type mice, 19.17 ± 5.68 mg g−1; and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed wild-type mice, 63.65 ± 16.44 mg g−1.",537da2e6-7b3e-4c50-a42c-e4041089c386

Effect of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) on induction of very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R) in the liver As very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) regulates the release of triglycerides from the liver to the blood stream,18 we expected that up-regulation of Vldlr would correlate with the liver phenotype in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice. Immunoblot analysis showed that very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R), which is not normally expressed in the liver,17,22 was detected in the liver of mice fed the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) (Fig. 2).

These results indicate that the release of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) from the liver to the blood stream is not impaired in either low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mouse strain; rather, only very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-mediated triglyceride release is specifically inhibited in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed wild-type mice. The increase in LDL-cholesterol levels in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed wild-type mice also supports the normal release of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) from the liver in these mice.",6d8f872f-eb0a-4cfa-b4d2-6125e5d81830
20,results10," In low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed ob/ob mice, the cholesterol content of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) fraction was considerably lower than the triglyceride content, indicating that triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) was generated in these mice. Furthermore, LDL-triglyceride levels were significantly higher in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed ob/ob mice, but unchanged in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed wild-type mice, which indicates a difference between ob/ob and wild-type mice in terms of conversion from very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglycerides to LDL-triglycerides.

22,discussion0,"A novel effect of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) on induction of very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R) expression was found in the liver, where this receptor is not normally expressed. Previous studies reported that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α agonist fenofibrate promotes not only hepatic very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R) expression22 but also steatosis,23 which is in agreement with the phenotype of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed wild-type mice in the present study. The induction of hepatic very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R) expression by fenofibrate or over-expression of very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R) decreases triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels via triglyceride clearance by the liver,22,24 which can promote the development of liver steatosis.",d4f63e81-1909-47ae-96a6-8ad2fe688d53
23,discussion1,"  F3666 is a commonly used low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) for rodents, and several recent studies have examined the effects of the low amounts of choline and protein in this diet.14,15 A lack of sufficient choline is associated with the development of steatosis in the liver,14,15,25 which impairs hepatic triglyceride secretion due to an absence of phosphatidylcholine synthesis.25 Choline supplementation can improve this pathologic condition.14,15 The low protein content of the F3666 diet increases the expression of several genes in the liver, but this effect is attenuated by methionine supplementation.15 These observations suggest that the low choline and protein content of the F3666 diet also played a role in the effects observed in our model. However, in ob/ob mice in our model, the F3666 diet prevented the progression of liver steatosis observed in chow-fed ob/ob mice (Fig. 1).",18ccbd6d-573e-4d02-a0c2-100dbcc122aa
24,discussion2," Furthermore, the F3666 diet used in our study contained an abundance of choline-containing phospholipids (phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins, 5.8 ± 0.2 g kg−1), and serum levels of choline-containing phospholipids in F3666-fed mice were also significantly higher than the levels in chow-fed mice (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results indicate that choline was supplied to peripheral tissues in sufficient amounts in the mice using this study, and therefore, choline levels had a minimal effect on development of steatosis.  We also observed very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R) expression in the liver of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed ob/ob mice, in which the hyperphagic phenotype can compensate for the low protein content of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD).",a43faefe-40b6-48e5-9cd2-8ec068b16bd6

As the low protein content of the F3666 diet plays an important role in the generation of ketone bodies in rodents,19 we conclude that the low-carbohydrate and high-fat/ketogenic properties of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) induce hepatic very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R) expression.  Based on the results of our present and previous studies,13,16 Fig. 3 illustrates the dynamics and metabolism of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice and presents a working hypothesis of how very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) affect very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride kinetics.",681bf89e-8429-4771-bf24-55ae44bc4b3b

As an absence of hepatic leptin signaling leads to elevated triglyceride levels in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles,28 the production of triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) is likely associated with leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice.29 The maintenance of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed ob/ob mice could also accelerate the release of triglycerides to extrahepatic tissues.",a2891dab-9d6d-42f8-be12-4f695373ba58
31,discussion9," As leptin regulates lipoprotein lipase (LPL) production and activity in the tissues,30 maintenance of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity is also likely associated with leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice.29  Based on these observations, we conclude that the transport of triglycerides via very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) from the liver to extrahepatic tissues is inhibited by low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-induced hepatic very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R) expression under conditions of low lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. As this inhibition of triglyceride transport is rescued in leptin-deficient mice, regulating very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) metabolism by hepatic very low density lipoprotein receptor (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)R), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and leptin may represent a new therapeutic strategy for preventing diet-induced liver steatosis.
