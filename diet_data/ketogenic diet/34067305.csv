0,background0," Ketogenic diets have been used to treat both obesity and neurological disorders, including epilepsy and more recently Alzheimer’s disease (AD), likely due to favorable effects on both central and peripheral metabolism. Improvements in body composition have also been reported; however, it is unclear if diet-induced changes in adiposity are related to improvements in AD and related neuropathology.  Purpose  We examined the effects of a Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK)) diet vs. an American Heart Association (American Heart Association (AHA)) diet on body weight, body composition, and body fat distribution and their association with cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) biomarkers in older adults at risk for AD.

1,methods0," Twenty adults (mean age: 64.3 ± 6.3 years, 35% Black, 75% female) were randomly assigned to a crossover trial starting with either the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) or American Heart Association (AHA) diet for 6 weeks, followed by a 6-week washout and then the opposite diet for 6 weeks. At baseline and after each diet adiposity was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers were measured. Linear mixed effect models were used to examine the effect of diet on adiposity. Spearman correlations were examined to assess associations between adiposity and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers.   Study Participants  Community-dwelling adults at risk for AD dementia based on the presence of prediabetes and either subjective memory complaints (subjective memory complaints (SMC)) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) were recruited to participate.",32dd2ff7-2a93-4bc5-8d26-39fcf002e100
2,methods1," Pre-diabetes was defined according to American Diabetes Association guidelines as a hemoglobin A1c level between 5.7% and 6.4% (American Diabetes Association, 2015). subjective memory complaints (SMC) were defined according to Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative criteria as a Cognitive Change Index score ≥ 16 on the first 12 items . mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed by expert physicians and neuropsychologists using National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association criteria . Individuals with a prior diagnosis of neurological or neurodegenerative illness (except mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), major psychiatric disorder, stroke, use of diabetes and lipid-lowering medications, or use of medications with known central nervous system effects including anti-seizure medications, anti-psychotics, and opioids were excluded.

3,methods2,"gov Identifier: NCT02984540), and all participants and/or their study partners provided written informed consent prior to participating.  Study Design and Procedures  The study consisted of a randomized crossover design in which participants consumed either the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet or an American Heart Association (American Heart Association (AHA)) low-fat diet  for 6 weeks, followed by a 6-week washout period in which participants were instructed to resume their pre-study diet. Afterward the second diet was consumed for 6 weeks. Lumbar punctures (LPs) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA)) scans were completed prior to randomization and at the end of each diet. Adherence and blood metabolic laboratory profiles were also assessed at the half-way point of each diet period.",540b0c60-f181-4232-8442-258293f96a12
4,methods3," Participants completed a 3-day record in which they recorded all food consumed on 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day at baseline and during weeks 3 and 6 of the diet interventions. Total calorie and macronutrient intakes were calculated from the food records using ProNutra software (Viocare, Princeton, NJ, United States).  Dietary Interventions  The two dietary interventions were isocaloric, with the main distinction being the proportion of calories from carbohydrates and fat. Specifically, the target macronutrient composition (expressed as % of total calories) for the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet was approximately 5–10% carbohydrate, 60–65% fat, and 30% protein, whereas the target macronutrient composition for the American Heart Association (AHA) diet was 55–65% carbohydrate, 15–20% fat, and 20–30% protein. Participants worked closely with a registered dietitian (RD) to keep macronutrients within the desired target ranges.",2da11c56-6729-4ead-9166-6380303aac8b
5,methods4," The RD developed daily meal plans, a food list, and other educational material for each study participant based on the 3-day food diary, activity level, and macronutrient requirements to help the participants make appropriate food purchases. During the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet period, participants were encouraged to consume healthy fats, protein sources low in saturated fat (i.e., fish, lean meats), fruits, vegetables, and whole grains (within limits), while avoiding low-carbohydrate store-bought products and artificially sweetened beverages. Participants were supplied with 1 L of extra-virgin olive oil to use as the primary source of healthy fat in their diet and were allowed one glass of wine per day.",ee5a718a-b026-4ddf-b519-dd44719ed3e7
6,methods5," During the American Heart Association (AHA) diet period, participants were encouraged to eat plentiful fruits, vegetables, and carbohydrates containing adequate fiber, as well as proteins from healthy sources such as fish and lean meat, while limiting their fat intake to < 40 g/d (with no provision of supplementary olive oil). To minimize potential confounding effects on metabolism, participants were asked to keep their exercise and physical activity levels stable and to discontinue the following supplements: resveratrol, coenzyme Q10, coconut oil/other medium chain triglyceride-containing (i.e., Axona) supplements, and curcumin. However, they were provided a multivitamin (Centrum Silver) to use daily throughout the diet period. To monitor adherence, food records and capillary ketone measurements were reviewed during weekly in-person and phone-based visits with the study RD.",9ad6712d-b133-4a61-88f1-62333760e21c
7,methods6," As previously reported, adherence to the diets was high (≥ 90%) resulting in the expected changes in macronutrient composition for both diets, as well as increases in fasting ketone body levels on the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet .  Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers  LPs were conducted after a 12-h overnight fast at baseline and at the end of each diet period. Following local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, a 22-gauge Sprotte needle was used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the L3-4 or L4-5 interspace while participants rested in the seated or lateral decubitus position. cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was transferred into pre-chilled polypropylene tubes, frozen immediately on dry ice, and stored at −80°C until analysis of key biomarkers. Aβ42, total tau, and phospho-tau (tau-p181) were measured using a Luminex-based INNO-BIA AlzBio3 assay.",efa3095b-e81d-4f10-8941-609ede240d36
8,methods7," Aβ40 was measured using a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to manufacturer instructions (Fujirebio, Malvern, PA, United States). Other emerging AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) including neurogranin, sTREM2 (Meso Scale Discovery), YKL-40 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, United States), and neurofilament light (NFL) (Uman-Diagnostics, Umeå, Sweden) were measured using in-house or commercially-available assays, as previously described (Portelius et al., 2018; Gisslén et al., 2019; Neth et al., 2020). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities were measured as previously described . All assays were performed by board-certified laboratory technicians blinded to clinical data. Baseline and post-diet samples were analyzed side-by-side on the same assay plates, and intra-assay coefficients of variation were below 10%.",aec27ff9-f5b7-4438-abf0-11279f454d61
9,methods8,"  Body Composition and Fat Distribution  Whole body dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were performed on a Hologic Horizon scanner (Hologic Inc., Belford, MA, United States) using the BodyLogic scan and APEX analysis software (version 5.5.3.1) to determine whole body and regional measures of fat and lean tissue. Regional boundaries were demarcated automatically using anatomical landmarks. The trunk region includes the neck, chest, abdominal and pelvic areas. The leg region includes all the area below the trunk. The android (waist) region is the area between the ribs and the pelvis and is totally enclosed by the trunk region. The gynoid (hip) region includes the hips and upper thighs and overlaps both the leg and trunk regions. Regional adiposity is reported as both absolute fat mass and the percentage of fat in each region. Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT, SAT) cross-sectional areas in the abdominal region were estimated using InnerCore VAT Assessment technology.",9e8f7245-0166-471a-bf07-91f69e897dd4
10,methods9," Measures of fat distribution including trunk/leg, android/gynoid, and VAT/SAT ratios were calculated.  Statistical Analyses  Baseline characteristics were described as mean (standard deviation) or N (%) overall and by cognitive group (subjective memory complaints (SMC) vs. mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). Linear mixed effect models were fitted separately for the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) and American Heart Association (AHA) diets to examine the effect of diet on adiposity. Time (pre vs. post) was the repeated factor, with cognitive group as an independent factor. Age and diet order (Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet first vs. American Heart Association (AHA) diet first) were included as covariates. Interactions between time and cognitive group and diet order were examined. Diet carryover effects and diet effects were examined in the framework of crossover design using the Grizzle two-stage model.",7b5b5e38-91ae-4b4b-a8b7-6b5b44c5b59d

As shown in Table 1, and reported previously in the main paper , the study population was on average 64 years of age (range: 55–84 years), well-educated (mean years of education: 16.1), and predominately female (75%). Over one-third of participants were Black (35%), 32% were carriers of the APOE ε4 allele, and 9 (45%) had mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Based on the two-stage mode, there were no significant differential carryover effects (p’s > 0.20). Although the magnitude of improvement in adiposity was similar between diets, body weight (p = 0.03), body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.02), total lean mass (p = 0.003), and android/gynoid ratio (p = 0.03) were lower after the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet compared to the American Heart Association (AHA) diet.

22,discussion0," The present study examined the effects of an Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) vs. American Heart Association (AHA) diet on body weight, body composition, and body fat distribution in older adults at risk for AD. We hypothesized that the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet would lead to significant reductions in body weight and improvements in body composition and body fat distribution compared to the American Heart Association (AHA) diet and that these improvements would be associated with favorable changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profile. We also hypothesized that there would be distinct associations between adiposity and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers depending on the location of fat (i.e., central/visceral vs. peripheral). We found that both the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) and American Heart Association (AHA) diets led to similar improvements in adiposity.",63ff5a77-c13e-4a57-a998-1ea2f75e6963
23,discussion1," We also observed significant associations between changes in total and regional adiposity and changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for both diets; yet, there were notable differences between diets. These findings provide novel evidence linking Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet-induced changes in neuropathology and adiposity, which could have important implications for the management of AD and related metabolic dysfunction.  Ketogenic diets induce a state of ketosis through the formation of ketone bodies, which serve as an alternative fuel source and provide robust neurological effects. The Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet was developed to improve adherence and reduce health risks associated with high saturated fat intake on a traditional ketogenic diet.",a5020d90-50ca-4486-8f2e-50bfe99fa892
24,discussion2," Importantly, the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet has comparable efficacy, but allows for slightly higher carbohydrate intake to permit increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, as well as fats and proteins derived from healthy sources such as olive oil and fish, consistent with a Mediterranean dietary pattern . We previously reported that a 6-week Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet intervention led to significant improvements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, cerebral perfusion, memory, and metabolic indices in adults at risk for AD . In the present study, we extend these findings by demonstrating that the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet is also associated with significant improvements in body weight, body composition and body fat distribution.",f79ada7b-6d09-415c-850d-89d602d3455c
25,discussion3," Similar improvements in adiposity were observed following the American Heart Association (AHA) diet, although reductions in body weight was less compared to the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet. The observed weight loss was not surprising given that caloric intake was reduced by ∼300–500 kcal/day (15–26%) while on the diets . Although the calorie content of the diets was matched to pre-study food intake, participants consumed less than the recommended amount of food during the intervention, a common occurrence with any prescribed dietary intervention. Importantly, the caloric intake did not differ between the two study diets, and so it is unlikely to have accounted for the different dietary effects. In response to both diets, there were significant decreases in total body fat due to reductions in all regions assessed including the trunk, legs, abdomen (android), and hips (gynoid), as well as VAT and SAT areas.",93bd3be4-4f21-4019-b6c9-f09c6b0e4589
26,discussion4," There were also decreases in the trunk/leg and android/gynoid ratios suggesting improved body fat distribution. Taken together, these data suggest that in the presence of mild-to-moderate caloric restriction, both the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) and American Heart Association (AHA) diets are effective at reducing body fat in older adults at risk for AD.  To our knowledge, this study is the first to report associations between adiposity and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers in response to a dietary intervention. Interestingly, we found that decreases in body fat on the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet were mostly related to changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ biomarkers, whereas decreases in body fat on the American Heart Association (AHA) diet were largely related to changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau biomarkers.",b8b94b69-f00b-40d1-b503-44a1054c8c6c
27,discussion5," Modest fat loss on the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet was associated with increased levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid biomarkers (Aβ42, Aβ42/Aβ42 ratio, Aβ42/tau-p181 ratio), generally considered a more favorable profile, while greater fat loss was associated with worsened cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ profiles (i.e., decreased levels). On the other hand, fat loss on the American Heart Association (AHA) diet was associated with both decreases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and tau-p181 (suggesting a favorable effect) and increases in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau-p181/tau ratio (suggesting an adverse effect). Improvements in cholinesterase activity on the American Heart Association (AHA) diet were also associated with greater fat loss, particularly in the abdominal region.",7b09ac71-6d62-4805-a0a6-a4f3f1fa5fce
28,discussion6," Another striking difference between the diets was the opposing association observed between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurogranin and VAT area following the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet (i.e., positive correlation) and the American Heart Association (AHA) diet (i.e., negative correlation). While the reasons for these differences are not clear, the availability of carbohydrate vs. fat likely has important implications for both adipose and brain tissue and may modulate inter-organ relationships. With the sensitivity analyses identifying potential outliers in this small sample, it will be important for future studies to determine if the moderate-to-strong correlations observed in the present study hold up in a larger sample.  It is worth noting that some of the inconsistencies in the results may be related to the fact that the dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived central fat measures used here (i.e.",afe0352b-e0b0-48b0-8847-e70072d763d7
29,discussion7,", trunk fat, android fat), which are thought to reflect visceral adiposity, cannot truly distinguish VAT vs. SAT in those regions. The same is true for leg fat, which encompasses both SAT and VAT stored within and around skeletal muscle. This is important given the well-established anatomical, cellular, molecular, physiological, clinical and prognostic differences in fat depots . VAT is strongly associated with chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and an increased risk for cardiometabolic diseases . In contrast, SAT may have a protective role by serving as a metabolic sink to store excess triglyceride during energy surplus, particularly when found in the hips and thighs. Indeed, studies show that abdominal VAT, thigh SAT, and thigh intermuscular fat are all independently associated with cardiometabolic risk (Snijder et al., 2005; Yim et al., 2008; Koster et al., 2010).",8281afe0-d499-4ec5-afb4-6f6a834708f8
30,discussion8," In the present study, a higher VAT/SAT ratio at baseline was associated with higher neurogranin, neurofilament light (NFL), sTREM2, and cholinesterase activity. These data suggest that VAT, either directly or indirectly via its association with cardiometabolic risk factors, may promote synaptic dysfunction, axonal injury, neuroinflammation and impaired neurotransmission. In contrast, higher total fat mass and peripheral adiposity, including higher leg and gynoid fat, were associated with lower neurofilament light (NFL) and/or cholinesterase activity, suggesting a protective role. Although none of the adiposity variables were significantly associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau in cross-sectional analyses, there were trends (p < 0.10) for higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau-p181 and a lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42/p-tau ratio in those with higher VAT.",8af79e76-e411-45c0-aa06-f00a309c0345
31,discussion9," Despite the small sample sizes and multiple comparisons, our data suggest that the distribution of body fat in visceral vs. peripheral depots, rather than the total amount of fat, is linked to neuropathological processes in the brain. These findings are consistent with prior studies demonstrating a protective effective for higher body mass index (BMI) in late life (Atti et al., 2008; West and Haan, 2009) and suggest that higher body fat may reflect greater availability of lipids for fatty acid oxidation to use as an alternative fuel source in addition to glucose. More importantly, our novel findings indicate that in late life, greater brain neuropathology likely coincides with greater visceral adiposity and lower peripheral adiposity, independent of total body fat.  Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that body fat distribution provides useful information above and beyond body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference when considering obesity-related risks for AD.",3f35700d-9c27-43c1-8449-4bda0e7477ce
32,discussion10," For example, abdominal VAT/SAT ratio was found to be ∼40% higher in AD patients compared to non-AD controls, despite similar body mass index (BMI) (Diehl-Wiesenecker et al., 2015). Several studies have also reported associations between higher abdominal VAT and adverse brain outcomes, including reduced total brain volume and hippocampal atrophy , cerebral large and small vessel disease , reduced cortical thickness , impaired functional connectivity , and microstructural damage . In addition, working memory is negatively associated with android fat and positively associated with gynoid fat in older adults .",07e1f0ff-48bc-4eb0-95a5-3b2a0a5a7bdc
33,discussion11," While the underlying mechanisms for these associations are not completely understood, adipose tissue-derived signals including adipokines, lipids, metabolites, non-coding RNAs, and exosomes likely play a role in modulating cross-talk between adipose tissue and the brain. These factors are secreted from adipose tissue and act as autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine mediators capable of modulating energy metabolism, inflammation, insulin signaling, neuronal function, and Aβ pathology (Kiliaan et al., 2014; Ishii and Iadecola, 2016). They may also underlie the metabolic and neurological benefits associated with a ketogenic diet  and likely help explain the observed changes in the present study.",b4017bc1-1812-4423-b136-324ad3540f57
34,discussion12,"  The limitations of this study include the small sample size, the lack of correction for multiple comparisons, and the brief intervention duration; however, this was a pilot study that was meant to be hypothesis generating and set the foundation for future studies to elucidate the role of adiposity in AD development and progression. A larger, well-powered clinical trial is needed to confirm the intervention effects and adequately test for associations between adiposity and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. In addition, although dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) provides validated and reliable measures of body composition and body fat distribution, dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived VAT is merely an estimate of visceral adiposity. Follow-up studies using more precise measures of body fat distribution from computed tomography scans will be necessary to further elucidate the role of fat in key VAT and SAT depots and are currently ongoing.",023f9f99-e22d-4872-8ab1-9d78a57a3b91
35,discussion13," Nevertheless, the present study is the first to explore associations between regional adiposity and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers and provides preliminary evidence that an Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet leads to favorable changes in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and total/regional adiposity. The finding that these changes were correlated suggest that in older adults at risk for AD, the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet is a promising therapeutic intervention to improve brain health via changes in both central and peripheral metabolism, and that modest weight loss, while maximizing visceral fat loss and preserving peripheral fat depots, may have the greatest impact.",82421ac1-71f9-4916-97fc-b2df27d0cc5d
36,discussion14," Given that there are no known interventions that can preferentially target loss of specific fat depots, more research is needed to better understand the implications of weight and fat loss on neuropathological changes associated with the Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic (MMK) diet.
