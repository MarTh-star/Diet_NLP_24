0,background0,"Glioblastoma (GB) is the commonest form of malignant brain tumour in adults, affecting 2–3 people per 100,000 per year [1]. Despite current treatment options including maximal safe resection, radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy [2], overall survival at 2 years remains poor (median survival of 12–14 months [3]). Several recent trials investigating newer chemotherapy agents (e.g. RTOG 0825–Bevacizumab trial [4]) and targeted therapies (e.g., CENTRIC–Celengitide trial [5]) have not resulted in any improvement to prognosis. Therefore, alternative treatment options are being explored and there is increasing clinical interest for investigating the ketogenic diet (KD) therapy as an adjuvant treatment for patients with GB.  KDs are high fat, low carbohydrate diets, resulting in the production of ketones as a primary energy source, depriving the glycolytic pathways utilised for growth by GBs.",28bd05dc-e2e0-4284-8ff9-c66263d2903c
1,background1," Laboratory studies of the effect of KDs in glioma mouse models have demonstrated increased survival [6], enhanced radiotherapy sensitivity [7], improved chemotherapy signalling [8] and reduced peritumoural oedema [9].  Recent studies investigating the use of the KD in humans have focused on the feasibility, safety and efficacy, in view of the fact that the diet may be considered unpalatable and unacceptable to patients with a limited life expectancy. Several small case studies [10–13] and one pilot study [14] have been reported.  Various forms of the KD have been developed over recent years to improve palatability and compliance, whilst maintaining efficacy within the diets primary evidence base of paediatric epilepsy [15, 16].",c61a6180-7ac4-4377-bdd9-f5373f44ad4f
2,background2," The two least restrictive KD are the modified ketogenic diet (modified ketogenic diet (MKD)) and the medium chain triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) KD, both of which are currently used for treating paediatric epilepsy within the National Health Service (National Health Service (NHS)) and have been utilised in previous glioblastoma case series.  The modified ketogenic diet (MKD) induces ketosis through encouraging a high fat and low carbohydrate intake, without limiting protein, fluid or energy intakes. There is no need for a fasting start or hospitalisation to commence the diet [17]. modified ketogenic diet (MKD) is likely to be the most flexible and palatable KDs; therefore, may be more suitable for adults undergoing oncological treatments.  medium chain triglyceride (MCT) KD was first described by Huttenlocher, Wilbourn and Signore [18] as a modification to the classic KD.",0ec32c8c-eb2d-470c-8dac-75cf30a6cff2
3,background3," It allows for the inclusion of larger portions of carbohydrate, thus, improving dietary tolerance and acceptability. A recent study by Martuscello et al. [19] investigating the use of medium chain triglyceride (MCT) KD in GB animal models found slower tumour progression, increased survival, increased body weight and positive changes to serum lipids, in comparison to a standard KD and controls.  Rationale The effect of lifestyle factors (including diet) on tumours is one of the top 10 priority areas for research identified by the James Lind Priority Setting Partnership in the Neuro-Oncology community [20]. To enable an adequately powered randomised controlled trial to be undertaken, investigating the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in the therapeutic management of glioblastoma, this preliminary study is important to test protocol methodology and to explore potential impact on patient quality of life and health.",44fc2f6f-c704-49b8-a999-36fd90e4e76a
4,background4," At present, it is not known which KD, if any, holds promise for further investigation of effectiveness. Therefore, this study will directly compare two KD (modified ketogenic diet (MKD) and medium chain triglyceride (MCT) KD) to determine which diet is most deliverable and best adhered to by patients in order to test clinical effectiveness, as a primary outcome (overall survival) in a future definitive trial, within an National Health Service (NHS) glioblastoma population. In a trial of effectiveness, a control group would be required (such as ‘healthy eating’) and directly compared to the ‘successful’ dietary arm from this pilot. ",d1cfc5ab-6caa-46d4-a7e2-bcf6c5157817

Secondary objectives in relation to protocol feasibility include estimations of recruitment, enrolment and long-term retention rates and to obtain data on dietary compliance, dietary adjustments required to achieve ketosis, ketone and glucose levels, intervention time, protocol refinements and completeness of data.

Oncology treatment will continue in line with the standard of care.  Both modified ketogenic diet (MKD) and medium chain triglyceride (MCT) KD are high in fat and low in carbohydrate. However, they contain different amounts and types of fat. The modified ketogenic diet (MKD) provides fat to 80% of total energy requirements (predominately long-chain fatty acids) and 5% carbohydrate. Whilst the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) KD provides fat to 75% of total energy requirements (30% of which is medium chain fatty acids, consumed via a nutritional supplement), and 10% carbohydrate. Protein is allowed freely in both diets.  Patients (and relatives when appropriate) will receive dietetic counselling and be provided with dietary literature to calculate intakes of these food groups.",7c20c6b4-4ece-43d4-ab7b-0ab0a4fdb3ac

28,discussion0,"Practical considerations When designing the trial, we considered a number of practical issues to enable implementation within an National Health Service (NHS) setting.  When deciding on which KDs to include within the trial, nutritional adequacy and previous evidence base were considered. There are various types of KDs, offering varying contents of fat and carbohydrate. From the literature the two KDs previous cited in oncology case series include the modified ketogenic diet (MKD) and the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) KD [13, 14, 39, 40]. Both diets allow for the sufficient provision of protein, essential for patients undergoing oncological treatments, in comparison to the classic ketogenic diet which would not meet adult protein requirements. Both medium chain triglyceride (MCT) and modified ketogenic diet (MKD) are currently used in National Health Service (NHS) practice for patients with refractory epilepsy.  In this trial, the KD will be offered alongside current standard of care.",c2edcbc0-f2ec-4446-be6b-27d811465be2
29,discussion1," In order to allow for future meta-analysis of data, the diet will be commenced post-surgical resection, prior to chemoradiotherapy in keeping with US centres [41, 42]. This theory is supported by previous animal models which illustrate the KD to enhance the effects of chemoradiation [6–8].  Methods for assessing ketone and glucose levels were also considered. Blood ketone and glucose levels can provide a more accurate result, when compared to urinary ketones, due to the effects of urinary dilution. However, blood monitoring is more invasive for the patient and considerably more expensive when considering trial design and potential future National Health Service (NHS) implementation. The minimum ketone monitoring requirements cited by the International League Against Epilepsy Task Force for Diet Therapy state urinary ketones to be a minimum standard [43].",9ea5aa29-c471-4013-9972-59d4f2a175ff
30,discussion2," Therefore, in keeping with this, we will conduct urinary ketone monitoring, with additional weekly blood ketone and glucose levels (home finger prick testing), with a view to informing future methodology.  In terms of recruitment, 12 patients is an achievable target and suitable for a pilot study, however, an element of statistical uncertainty will be present. Therefore, we have opted for descriptive statistical methods and will apply caution when interpreting results for any future study design.

Adverse events The main health risks associated with the diet include gastrointestinal intolerance (such as diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, reflux, abdominal discomfort), altered or raised cholesterol, kidney stones and decreased bone density [44].  To monitor these health risks biochemistry will be monitored every 3 months (renal, bone, LFT, fasting cholesterol and glucose). Gastrointestinal side effects will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4, [45]), and dietary adjustments will be made to aid symptom relief when possible.
