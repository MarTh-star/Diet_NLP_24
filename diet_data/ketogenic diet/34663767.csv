0,discussion0," Medically, ketogenic diets are not the preferred pharmacological preference for candida or HS. Following oral administration, antifungal azole derivatives undergo hepatic biotransformation, culminating in a plasma half-life of 30 hours. Therefore, a single daily or weekly dose of 150 mg is sufficient to treat mucocutaneous candidiasis.  Ketogenesis is activated in concert with gluconeogenesis during fasting, starvation, or minimal carbohydrate intake [2]. During gluconeogenesis, glucagon activation of the cAMP cascade in the liver inhibits glycolysis, therefore limiting pyruvate production from carbohydrates [2]. Pyruvate that is created from lactate or alanine is converted to oxaloacetate by the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase, which is further activated by acetyl-CoA. The oxaloacetate is converted to malate for gluconeogenesis, but due to the low level of oxaloacetate, the acetyl-CoA is directed to ketogenesis rather than used for energy metabolism in Kreb’s cycle [2].",c0a44dfa-6240-49cb-8123-a2fd793a7514
1,discussion1," High ATP concentration produced during fat metabolism inhibits the TCA cycle at the isocitrate dehydrogenase step and also inhibits the electron transport chain due to an increase in the mitochondrial membrane potential [2]. The resulting increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio favors the reduction of oxaloacetate to malate (in order to reverse the ratio and regenerate NAD+), which exits the mitochondrion for gluconeogenesis, instead of consumption in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Ultimately, acetyl-CoA produced by β-oxidation of fatty acids is converted to ketone bodies.  Ketogenic diets were first popularized in the early 20th century for their efficacy in the management of refractory epilepsy. Since then, it has gained recognition as a concurrent or complementary therapeutic strategy for the management of many cancers and chronic inflammatory diseases [3].",647e406c-66a7-48d6-9b16-bbb35cef2087
2,discussion2," Ketone body metabolism provides normal cells with a metabolic advantage over fungal cells due to increased change in Gibb’s Free Energy of ATP hydrolysis from approximately −56kJ/mole to −59kJ/mole [4]. Normally, the body’s cells (macrophages, neutrophils) phagocytose C. albicans, and oxidative killing is the first line of host defense, illustrated by the increased risk of C. albicans infection in individuals with neutropenia or defects in oxidative enzymes NADPH oxidase or myeloperoxidase [5]. Thus, a more energized arsenal for phagocytes as a result of ketosis improves the elimination of Candida spp. overgrowth. Restricted Ketogenic diets are also anti-inflammatory and can therefore minimize chronic inflammation [4]. Both energized cells of the immune system and the alleviation of chronic inflammation may explain the alleviation of the patient’s symptoms to the ketogenic diet. Here, we demonstrate the beneficial effect of ketogenic diets in Candida vulvovaginitis.",3cf9cd03-0041-4634-a5bf-1e0c2bf75805
3,discussion3,"  Conclusions  Despite current literature that informs clinicians to utilize antifungal azole derivatives in the treatment of mucocutaneous Candida spp. infection and surgical removal for the management of vulvar hidradenitis suppurativa, this case study describes long-term successful management of both with a zero-carbohydrate nutritional strategy without the use of medication or invasive surgery. Possible mechanisms by which an all-meat ketogenic diet might reduce Candida spp. growth and eliminate symptoms of vulvar Hidradenitis are discussed in the remainder of this paper. An all-meat ketogenic diet was successfully utilized to treat Candida vulvovaginitis and vulvar hidradenitis suppurativa. Further studies will be needed to test this hypothesis in other patients diagnosed with Candida vulvovaginitis and vulvar hidradenitis suppurativa.  Human Ethics  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.  Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.",f45033a6-6b19-4f9d-a73c-2f0cb0b7b519
