0,methods0," 4.1. Animals and Experimental Design  The study was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (approval date: 28 November 2018, n. 901/2018-PR) according to European Union guidelines (Directive 2010/63/E.U. for animal experiments).  The animals (Wistar rats) were housed at the animal facility of the National Institute of Gastroenterology “S. de Bellis” Research Hospital, Castellana Grotte, Bari, Italy. All the applied procedures followed the International Guidelines for using laboratory animals, minimizing animal suffering.  The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adulthood was induced using the animal model of the newborn rats subjected to early-life stress through MD [33]. Postnatal Day 0 (Postnatal Day (PND) 0) was considered as the birthday. Within the Postnatal Day (PND)s 2 to 14, the puppies experienced MD for 3 h a day.",9c306a10-0198-46be-b19b-c9da47eb1c19
1,methods1,"  After weaning, the animals subjected to MD were further divided into two subgroups, one group fed a standard diet (irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-Std), and one group fed a low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet (irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-KD). The experimental design also included a control group of animals without MD and fed a standard diet (Ctrl-Std) and a group fed a low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet (Ctrl-KD) (Table 1). Only male rats were considered for this study.  Diets (4RF21 standard diet and ketogenic diet) were purchased by Mucedola Srl, Settimo Milanese, Italy, and administered ad libitum for ten weeks after Postnatal Day (PND) 14. Their composition is shown in Table 2.  Rats were checked every day, evaluating different parameters regarding the degree of suffering and stress induced experimentally (blepharospasm, hollow cheeks, abnormal position of the ears and the whiskers, appetite loss, and liquid stools).",e5e720b6-b509-4409-9464-9353e3ae06a7
2,methods2," Each parameter was recorded, attributing a score from 0 (absent) to 2 (evident) to calculate the possible onset of pain and suffering.  All animals in the study did not show any of the above stress-related symptoms, except for a slowdown in the growth of puppies with MD, which had lower weights than the control-group puppies.  After treatment, the animals were sacrificed by inhalation of an overdose of isoflurane, and both colon and brain samples were immediately removed and stored at −80 °C until assayed.  4.2. Serotonin Levels  The serotonin levels in colon and brain samples from all the experimental groups of rats were evaluated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) kits (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions.  4.3. Western Immunoblotting  Protein extracts were obtained using a standard procedure from colon and brain samples of Ctrl-Std, KD, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-Std, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-KD rats.",94db34c1-d845-4e76-9c6d-065d29990aff
3,methods3," For Western blot analysis, the aliquots of 50 µg of total protein extracts from each sample were loaded into 10% pre-cast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy). Anti-5-HT3B, anti-5-HT4, anti-SERT (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-TrkB (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), anti-β-actin, and anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) were used as primary antibodies. The proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy), and the densitometric analysis of each protein-related signal was obtained using the Molecular Imager ChemidocTM (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy) and normalized against β-actin or GAPDH expression.  4.4. Statistical Analysis  Due to the non-normal distribution of the data, nonparametric tests were performed. Data were analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance and Dunn’s Multiple Comparison Test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.",413afabc-2376-4e3b-8fd8-058abd73d066
4,methods4," All data represent the results of at least two independent experiments and are expressed as mean ± SEM. A specific statistical package was used for the exact nonparametric inference (StataCorp 2005; Stata Statistical Software: Release 9, College Station, TX, USA).  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, although partial, the results from this paper provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of KD in improving imbalanced gut–brain interconnections, thereby reducing the damaging effects of stress in an animal model of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This finding could have future clinical repercussions since the possibility of interrupting the dysfunction of the brain-gut axis through specific dietary treatments could allow new therapeutic strategies based on their neuroprotective properties.
