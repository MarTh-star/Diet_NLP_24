0,methods0," Animals and Rearing Conditions  Heterozygous CS + ⁣/⁣− founder mice were created at Lexicon Genetics from their OmniBank library of knockout embryonic stem cell clones. We crossed this CS + ⁣/⁣− founder mice more than ten times to transfer the null mutation onto the C57BL6/J genetic background. We used only male mice for the present studies. Male CS + ⁣/⁣− mice and WT littermates at 8–11 weeks of age were used in this study. The mice were housed with 2–4 animals per cage in a temperature- and humidity-controlled facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and free access to food and water.  Experimental Design and Diets  In the first experiment, the CS +/− (n = 7) and WT (n = 7) mice were fed a low-carbohydrate diet (88% fat, 11% protein, and 1% carbohydrate; 7.2 kcal/g), also called ketogenic diet because it induced ketosis in the subject consuming it, for 8 weeks.",d2281566-c8b2-491a-9010-b7519f013c64

There were no significant differences in body weight between WT and CS +/− mice on both low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and HCHFD feeding. The body weight of the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice decreased after 2 weeks, after which the mice gained weight as they grew. In contrast, all mice fed a HCHFD gained weight throughout the 8-week experimental period (Figure 1). After 8 weeks, the average body weight of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice was 28.9 ± 1.0 g in the WT group and 28.7 ± 0.8 g in the CS +/− group, and that of high fat high carbohydrate diet (HFHCD)-fed mice was 39.8 ± 1.1 g for WT mice and 40.5 ± 1.5 g for CS +/− mice (Table 1).",5b4b95c4-b6ba-42bd-abbf-ee172bf942ed

In the blood parameters, the levels of serum 3-hydroxybutyrate and non-esterified FA in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice and the levels of serum glucose and triglyceride in HCHFD-fed WT mice were significantly higher than those in the reference mice fed a regular diet. These data indicate that both the experimental diets were effective at inducing metabolic changes.

In both the heart and gastrocnemius muscles, Cs mRNA expression was significantly lower in CS +/− mice than that in WT mice, as expected (Figure 3). In low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice, significant increases in the expression of genes related to utilization of various substrates, such as FAs, glucose, lactate, ketone bodies, and amino acids, were observed in the heart of CS +/− mice as compared to that in WT mice; however, there were no significant differences in the expression of these genes in the gastrocnemius muscles (Figure 3A).",20fca804-0a2a-4e91-8055-23a408df86d0

Next, the expression of transcription factors that regulate the expression of substrate metabolism-related genes was measured in the hearts of CS +/− and WT mice. The mRNA expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (Pgc1α) and estrogen-related receptor α (Errα), which mainly regulate genes involved in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial electron transport, and that of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1), which is related to mitochondrial biogenesis, were significantly higher in CS +/− mice than those in WT mice fed an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) (Figure 4A).",4ced1905-90ec-4492-a1ae-1d0b8eb9920d

19,results9,"  Glycogen Metabolism in the Muscles of Low-Carbohydrate Ketogenic Diet-Fed Mice  Because the muscle adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels decreased in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed CS +/− mice, we measured the glycogen content, an important energy source for the muscles, in the muscle tissues of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice. At the end of the experimental period, muscle glycogen storage was significantly decreased in CS +/− mice compared to that in WT mice (Figure 6A).

Phosphorylation of p70 S6K was significantly suppressed in the muscles of CS +/− mice compared with that in WT mice, whereas the levels of phosphorylated Akt did not significantly differ between the two mouse groups (Figure 6B).  To evaluate the catabolic signaling, mRNA levels of the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1 (Atg1), and muscle RING finger-1 (MuRF-1) as well as the levels of light chain 3 proteins LC3-I and LC3-II were determined.",52819690-0983-4239-b098-196c989b9d37

Muscle Morphology of Low-Carbohydrate Ketogenic Diet-Fed Mice  In the morphological analysis, cross sectional area (CSA) of the total myofibers did not differ between WT and CS +/− mice (Figure 7A). However, in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice, further analysis of different muscle fiber types indicated that the cross sectional area (CSA) of type I oxidative fibers was significantly lower in CS +/− mice than in WT mice, whereas the cross sectional area (CSA) of type II glycolytic fibers did not differ between WT and CS +/− mice (Figure 7B).

24,discussion0," In this study, we compared the metabolic and physiological responses between WT and CS +/− mice fed with two types of diets: a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) and a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (high fat high carbohydrate diet (HFHCD)) diet.  The body weight of mice decreased after starting the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) feeding but increased steadily during high fat high carbohydrate diet (HFHCD) feeding. low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) consumption mimics the metabolic conditions of long-term starvation, and leads to body weight reduction in both humans and animals (25, 26). The possible causes of this weight loss include appetite loss due to the appetite-suppressant actions of ketosis or changes in appetite control hormones (27, 28), reduced lipogenesis, and increased lipolysis (29, 30).",c5ea2f5c-dfeb-4d49-a8aa-25c68ddb68c8
25,discussion1," In contrast, high fat high carbohydrate diet (HFHCD) consumption induces obesity, leading to metabolic conditions such as insulin resistance in rodents (23). However, neither of these diets led to significant differences in body weight changes between CS +/− and WT mice in this study, suggesting that CS insufficiency did not affect hormonal or metabolic factors involved in weight control.  Our results revealed an increase in the cardiac expression levels of genes related to the utilization of energy substrates, including FAs, glucose, lactate, ketone bodies, and amino acids in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed CS +/− mice. FAs are the main fuel source for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the heart; the adult myocardium utilizes FAs to supply approximately 60–70% of the total adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (5). The heart increasingly relies on FA oxidation during intracellular glucose shortages, which occur under certain conditions such as diabetes (31).",69a4f047-024c-4119-b272-69e2ec52cf97
26,discussion2," Thus, in the fasting-mimicking low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice, the increased expression of genes related to FA oxidation in CS +/− mouse hearts may be an adaptive response to energy shortages caused by CS insufficiency.  We also observed increased gene expression of the PGC1α coactivator and its transcription factor binding partners, ERRα and NRF1, in the hearts of CS +/− mice. These molecules amplify mitochondrial FA oxidation and respiration by regulating the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation (32, 33). In fact, the cardiac expressions of genes involved in not only FA oxidation but also oxidative phosphorylation were increased in low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice. Therefore, the increase in their expression levels may be part of a compensatory response to CS insufficiency.",857b891c-2114-4dd3-a00f-5d2f837b4b63
27,discussion3,"  It is well known that the shift of substrate utilization from FAs to glucose in the myocardium has been observed in cardiac disorders (34, 35). Nevertheless, unexpectedly, the expression levels of the genes related to cytosolic glycolysis were not altered in the hearts of animals with CS insufficiency. Similarly, recent studies showed that glycolysis and glucose oxidation did not increase in failing hearts (36, 37) and that the heart consumes small amounts of glucose as a fuel source, whether healthy or failing (38). In agreement with these findings, our results suggest that cardiac tissues do not enhance glycolysis as an adaptive strategy to compensate for energy shortages.  Lactate and ketone bodies have not received much attention as oxidative fuel for the heart. However, in humans and rodents, both fuels enter the cardiomyocytes mainly through monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT-1) (39) and contribute to energy production as an efficient energy substrate in the heart (40).",91f9d0e3-855a-47a9-9ace-8325a184f253
28,discussion4," Our results showed that the expression levels of genes related to lactate and ketone oxidation were significantly increased in the heart of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed CS +/− mice. As important energy substrates, the consumption of lactate and ketone bodies increases by nearly two and threefold in failing hearts, respectively (38), and the cardiac expression levels of Mct1 and Scot are upregulated under conditions of energy deficiency such as during exercise training (41) and in the failing heart (42). Therefore, the oxidation of lactate and ketone bodies may be an alternative pathway of energy production in the CS-insufficient heart.  The major amino acids consumed by the heart are glutamate and branched amino acids (BCAAs), which contribute to approximately 5% of total adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation (38, 43).",0f078fe4-b24e-43af-9d0b-894327787053
29,discussion5," Our results revealed increased expression levels of genes related to amino acid catabolism, particularly BCAAs, in the hearts of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed CS +/− mice. The contribution of amino acids to energy production in the heart has not been widely examined; however, a recent study revealed that the levels of BCAAs were increased significantly in the heart a few days after pressure overload or surgical infarction (44). Hence, BCAAs may be alternative fuels in energy-deficient hearts. Increased expression levels of genes encoding BCAA catabolic enzymes may be an adaptive compensation in CS-deprived hearts under conditions of a limited glucose supply.  In contrast to the results observed in the heart, the metabolic gene expression levels in the muscles showed no significant differences between CS +/− and WT mice, even in those consuming a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD).",793b976d-4e50-4896-8b6c-4b6398f99d52
30,discussion6," Thus, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content decreased, and activated kinase (AMPK) was activated in the muscles of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed CS +/− mice. These findings suggest that the metabolic gene expression in the muscle tissues is not increased as a compensatory response to decreased energy production. The mechanism by which the different adaptive responses to insufficient CS are induced in the heart and the muscles remains unclear. Nonetheless, our findings are consistent with those of a previous study revealing that the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and production were decreased by approximately 50% during aging in the muscle but not in the heart mitochondria (45).  Under restricted carbohydrate intake, we observed that the storage of glycogen, an important fuel for muscle contraction, and the activation of S6K, a key anabolic signaling molecule, were significantly suppressed in the muscles of CS +/− mice.",c95fab33-087f-48ae-8c5b-d4b5dbb3e9d7
31,discussion7," Further, the muscles presented fiber atrophy predominantly in mitochondria-rich type I fiber. Under adenosine triphosphate (ATP) deprivation, the cells shift from a state of growth to that of survival mode. A previous study reported that increased activated kinase (AMPK) activity inhibited mTOR and its downstream targets S6K, resulting in reduced cell sizes and growth rates to protect cells from energy deprivation-induced apoptosis (46). Furthermore, leg muscles release large amounts of amino acids, which act as alternative energy sources for the heart (38). Therefore, the inhibition of glycogen storage and signaling suppression of protein synthesis in the muscles of CS +/− mice may help ensure an adequate fuel supply to the heart when dietary carbohydrates are restricted.  In previous studies, mice fed an high fat high carbohydrate diet (HFHCD) for 4 months developed heart failure as well as cardiometabolic alterations associated with mitochondrial protein modification (47, 48).",83a85ceb-a3da-4bc0-ad75-770ec0255ca4
32,discussion8," Another study showed that high fat high carbohydrate diet (HFHCD)-feeding led to decreased glucose tolerance in female mice with genetically lower CS activity compared to that in wild-type mice (22). Therefore, we expected that high fat high carbohydrate diet (HFHCD)-fed CS +/− mice would develop metabolic disarrangement, at least in the heart. However, no significant differences were observed in metabolic parameters in both the heart and gastrocnemius muscles between CS +/− and WT mice. Thus, further studies with longer exposure to high fat high carbohydrate diet (HFHCD) or using female animals are needed to clarify whether high fat high carbohydrate diet (HFHCD) consumption affects energy metabolism in the heart and skeletal muscles of CS +/− mice.  This study has some limitations. First, we assessed mRNA expression related to mitochondrial capacity but did not measure mitochondrial content.",0955ce1b-c332-4f23-9372-00f8e0141030
33,discussion9," As the expression of the mitochondrial DNA transcript Cox-1 was increased in the heart of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice, CS insufficiency might lead to an increase in not only gene expression but also mitochondrial copy number. This requires further investigation. Second, we did not evaluate the functional changes in the heart of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-fed mice. Considering the increase in the expression of genes related to fuel utilization in these mice, it is necessary to investigate whether the cardiac functions are preserved.  In conclusion, in mice under ketogenic conditions and with low CS activity, the heart showed increased expression of genes related to fuel utilization. In contrast, suppression of anabolic signaling leading to oxidative fiber atrophy was observed in the muscles. These findings suggest that the heart switches between different fuel sources by regulating gene expression to adapt to chronic energy shortages.",32526565-19fa-44bd-8d7a-0a7cabb9f381
34,discussion10," In contrast, the skeletal muscles may sacrifice their growth to secure fuel sources for the heart. Our data provide an overview of fuel use in organs under conditions of energy shortage and a basis for understanding the etiology of metabolic disorders related to impaired tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolism.
