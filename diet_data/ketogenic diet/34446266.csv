0,methods0," This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines [36] and registered with PROSPERO (Registration ID: CRD42022310629), an international prospective registry for systematic reviews.  2.1. Literature Search  Two authors (YB and KZ) independently searched PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, and Web of Science from 1 January 2011 to 10 May 2022 using a comprehensive search strategy (Supplementary Methods S1). A secondary search strategy was also used which involved a manual search of the reference lists of selected articles. Searches were limited to the English language only. Systematic review and meta-analysis of the data were performed in STATA16.0 software according to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis (PRISMA)) guidelines [37].  2.2.",29e9e95b-a26c-4847-9c0b-f415705c92cd
1,methods1," Selection Criteria  Articles were included if they met the following criteria:the participants were adults over 18 years of age without the disease (e.g., the presence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, or any other diseases that required pharmacological treatment);  the intervention used in the study was CT with low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF);  the primary outcomes are lean mass (body composition) and VO2max (aerobic performance);  the secondary outcome are body mass, body fat percentage, and time (or distance) to complete the aerobic tests (100 km total time, 10 km total time, Yo-Yo total distance, total fatigue time and, total performance time);  the design of the study was a randomized (or not randomized) controlled trial;  the intervention duration was more than two weeks.  Articles were excluded if the language was not English, animal models were used, or the data were not extractable.",3cda6f7a-a33c-4042-9538-3afdf2795ad3
2,methods2," Reviews and conference articles were also excluded from the analysis.  2.3. Data Extraction  The process of data extraction was conducted according to the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook [36]. Two authors (YW and KZ) independently performed data extraction, and when a decision disagreement happened, it was discussed with the third author (JZ) until a consensus was achieved. The extracted information from the publications included: the study (authors, year), participants (age, sex, training experience), grouping and sample size, interventions (diet type, training type, frequency, intervention duration), and outcome measures.  Most studies only report data for pre- and post-intervention. Thus, average change was calculated as the difference between the mean of data pre- and post-intervention, and standard deviation (SD) was calculated using the following formula based on the principles of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [36,38].",6328d68e-d466-4bb0-97eb-988cbe5e84b7

Quality Assessment  The quality of the included studies was assessed independently by two authors (Y.W. and K.Z.) based on the principles of the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). The PEDro scale includes 11 items, and each study was assessed as either “yes” (score 1) or “no” (score 0) for each of those items. According to the PEDro guidelines, the maximum total score was 10 (Item 1 is not used to compute the total score). If a study received a score of 9 or 10, it was considered to be of very good quality; a score of 6 to 8 reflected good quality; a score of 4 or 5 showed medium quality and a score of 0 to 3 suggested poor quality [39]. Any score on which the two authors disagreed was discussed with a third author (J.Z.) until a consensus was achieved.  2.5.",3cf2db89-6cc6-406a-90d3-8d289d30ed38
4,methods4," Statistical Analysis  To determine the effect size of the intervention, the standardized mean differences (SMDs) of the outcomes were calculated (i.e., the mean difference between the effect of low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) and control divided by the pooled standard deviation). Effect sizes were classified as trivial (<0.2), small (0.2~0.5), moderate (0.5~0.8), or large (>0.8) [40]. Meta-analysis was performed in Stata v16.0 (STATA Corp., College Station, TX, USA) using the inverse variance method for included studies that compared the effects of low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) and control conditions on each included outcome. The statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using heterogeneity Chi-squared (χ2) and I2 values. The level of heterogeneity was interpreted according to guidelines from the Cochrane Collaboration: I2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75% for low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively [41].",13825c72-1a69-4ead-b732-0baadb00eda2
5,methods5," Due to the homogeneity of the included studies, in combination with a relatively low number of studies with small sample sizes, fixed-effect models were used. In accordance with the Cochrane recommendation [42]. However, in case of indications of heterogeneity (p < 0.1 and I2 > 50%), additional analyses were conducted using a random-effect model. In addition, publication bias was assessed by generating funnel plots and conducting Egger’s test. If a significant asymmetry was detected, we estimated the magnitude of the small study effect using the Trim and Fill method [43].  In addition to examining the place where heterogeneity may exist, we performed a series of subgroup analyses to examine the influences of different characteristics in the studies on the observations using the fixed-effect model [42]. Specifically, the analyses were performed based upon the training background of participants (i.e.",ad7bd98b-7168-4752-ab79-ac65d64417c3

Study Selection  The flow of the study identification and selection process is summarized in Figure 1. The initial search identified 2708 potentially relevant articles (PubMed n = 1055, Web of Science n = 989, EBSCO n = 244, EMBASE = 261, Sport-Discuss n = 63, Medline n = 94, Manual Search n = 2). Two manually included studies were retrieved from two reviews [44,45]. After the removal of duplicates, we identified 2047 publication records, consisting of 30 publications with full text. Next, these 30 full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility, and 22 of them were excluded. Finally, after completing the thorough full-text review, eight publications (Table 1) consisting of 170 participants were included in the quantitative synthesis [26,31,32,46,47,48,49,50].",bd3feae2-2b41-4528-a965-a05e84eb3f03
7,methods7," No disagreement was met between the two authors and all the papers included complete data that were needed for the review and meta-analysis.  3.2. Characteristics of the Included Studies  3.2.1. Participant Characteristics  The characteristics included were outlined in Table 1. In total, 170 participants were included. The sample size of the included studies ranged from 16 to 27 participants, with participants ranging in age from 23 to 35.4 years. Four studies [26,32,46,50] consisted of men only and the other four studies [31,47,48,49] included both men and women. Participants included in the studies were all physically active participants, including recreationally trained participants, as defined by training in a gym or club in spare time [47,48,49,50] and professionally trained participants, as defined by training in professional or national training institutions and participating in competitions [31,32,51,52].  3.2.2.",d020585b-b844-472f-bbe5-eee1b342aaaf
8,methods8," Intervention Characteristics  The physical training protocol in the included studies is CT. Specifically, three studies used the CT of resistance training combined with running, cycling, and swimming; two studies used the CT of resistance training combined with HIIT (high-intensity aerobic interval training); one study reported resistance training combined with cross-fit training (WOD: Workout of the Day); one study reported professional footballer training. Dietary interventions in all studies did not report specific daily dietary details but clearly stated that carbohydrate intake was less than 50 g per day. The daily intake of carbohydrates is a minimum of 7% [46] and a maximum of 17% [48], the intake of fat is a minimum of 43% [46], and a maximum of 75–80% [32]. The control group consisted of high carbohydrate diet [26,31,32], habitual diet [46,47,48,50] and restricted diet [49].",84fbc19b-eabe-43b1-8f0e-23a4a0ca3345
9,methods9,"  Four of the eight studies implemented intervention duration of six weeks or less, and four studies were greater than six weeks. Specifically, intervention duration in one study was of three weeks [32]; two studies were of 30 days [46,50]; one study of six weeks [50]; two of eight weeks [31,49] and two of 12 weeks [26,47].  3.3. Quality Assessment  The results of the quality assessment were shown in Table 2. It was demonstrated that all eight studies were scored between 4 and 6, suggesting the quality of the included studies was moderate. The experimental design of four studies was not randomized, and all the included studies did not implement a blinded trial protocol.  3.4. Study Outcomes  Details of the outcomes in each study were summarized in Table 1. The body mass was assessed in seven of the studies [26,31,32,46,47,48,50].",1aed5462-1106-4e7f-b737-d9ee93d7e80e

The lean mass was assessed in five of the studies. Specifically, three studies used DXA [26,46,48] and two studies used bio-electrical impedance (Inbody770 and Inbody230) [47,50]. The body fat percentage was assessed in five of the studies. Specifically, two studies used DXA [26,48]; two studies used bio-electrical impedance (Inbody770 and Inbody230) [47,50] and one used underwater weighing [49].

Meta-Analysis  All the studies in the systematic review were included in the following meta-analyses. We performed subgroup analyses to compare the effects of CT combined with low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) in different populations (i.e., recreationally trained participants or professionally trained participants) and the effects of intervention duration on those outcomes (Table 3).  3.5.1.

Discussion  To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the effects of CT combined with low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) on body composition and aerobic performance in trained participants. The quality of included studies is moderate. The results suggested that CT combined with low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) did not significantly affect body composition and aerobic performance in participants. Subgroup analyses also showed that the participant cohort (i.e., recreationally or professionally trained participants) and intervention duration (e.g., six weeks) did not significantly affect the results.",0c32de5b-6e50-4ebf-a2a4-cbea7411f8b6
20,methods20," More studies with rigorous design and better quality are highly recommended to confirm the observations from this work, which can ultimately help the appropriate design of nutritional programs for low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF).  Our results showed that CT combined with low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) did not induce a significant effect on lean mass. Studies showed that the low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) diet induces nutritional ketosis [54], reducing gluconeogenesis associated with increased muscle protein catabolism when using ketone bodies for energy production, so lean mass is preserved [55]. Meanwhile, we did not observe a significant reduction in body fat percentage and body mass with CT combined with low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF). One potential reason may be in the included studies, the calorie intake between the diet in the intervention (i.e., low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF)) and that in the control (e.g.",cb58d547-d65d-4440-8454-dd83e0684154
21,methods21,", restricted diet) may be similar, leading to similar influences on the body composition between groups [56,57]. For example, one study used CT combined with low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) in the intervention group and CT combined with a calorie-restricted diet in the control group; therefore, the reduction in body fat percentage was not significantly different between the two groups [50]. Future research thus needs to more explicitly and comprehensively characterize the benefits of low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) on body composition by using an appropriate study design.  We also observed that CT combined with low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) can help maintain VO2max and aerobic performance, that is, no significant decrease in VO2max and aerobic performance induced by CT with low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) was observed as compared to CT with other diets. Fat is a major energy source during low to moderate submaximal (<70% VO2max) aerobic exercise [58].",98502653-0128-47e5-8543-493de12d896e
22,methods22," Studies have shown that low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) can increase the rate of fat oxidation, switching from carbohydrates as the primary energy source, thereby improving aerobic performance during prolonged high-intensity aerobic exercise [26,59]. Sustained consumption of a ketogenic diet can enhance maximal fat oxidation to 1.5 g/min at 70% VO2max, replacing carbohydrates as the primary energy source [59]. These findings indicate that the use of a ketogenic diet can be considered to improve prolonged aerobic performance [26]. Conversely, exercise economy has been reported to decline when consuming a ketogenic diet [60], with reductions being most prevalent during higher (>70% VO2max) exercise intensities [60]. Future studies are needed to explore the effects of CT combined with low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) on aerobic performance in competition with longer times or greater intensity. Meanwhile, the use of different testing methods or outcomes (e.g.",11a20b11-bfe8-4a7c-a1a4-019c6e705e82
23,methods23,", 100 km total time, 10 km total time, Yo-Yo total distance, total fatigue time and, total performance time) of endurance performance may contribute to the variance of findings, which are worthwhile to be implemented in future studies.  Limitations: Several limitations of this work need to be noted. The number of included studies is relatively small, suggesting more studies are needed in this field. The details of the intervention protocol were not clearly provided in some studies [46,47], and in several studies, only the strength component was monitored while the endurance component was overlooked, which may distort the results in this work. A huge variance was observed in the design of included studies, lowering their quality and may potentially affecting the results. Therefore, the findings of this work should be taken with caution.  5.",0a2c6612-af7f-4f04-b3f2-cc0182c625fb
24,methods24," Conclusions  In summary, this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis shows that low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) combined with CT is expected to reduce body fat while maintaining lean mass and aerobic performance, which needs to be confirmed by studies with a more rigorous design. The results of this work provide important knowledge for designing future studies and training practices that implement low carb high fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) combined with CT.
