2,background2," Stress urinary incontinence (Stress urinary incontinence (SUI)) as a serious social problem restricted women’s daily life and affected their quality of life. Epidemiological data show that the overall incidence of Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) was 18.9% in women, with the age of onset increasing with age, and the highest incidence of Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) was 28.2% in the 50–59 age group [4]. Risk factors for Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) include age, genetic factors, decreased estrogen, constipation, chronic cough, obesity, etc. [5, 6]. The mechanism of stress urinary incontinence has been reported. Related hypotheses include: pressure conduction theory, high urethral motility theory, internal urethral sphincter defect theory and hammock hypothesis. However, none of them is widely accepted. More and more scholars believe that the occurrence of Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the result of interaction of multiple factors.",031d2984-18b8-4b98-803a-454fc21ef4b0

The International Consultation on Incontinence and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence suggest that patients with urinary incontinence should be treated first by conservertive treatment. For obese women with Stress urinary incontinence (SUI), weight loss is the first-line treatment, but weight loss has always been a difficult problem for obese women. Although traditional diet combined with exercise can reduce weight, the effect of weight loss is slow, and the patient's compliance is poor. Ketogenic diet is an efficient method of body mass management. It can quickly loss weight and has achieved significant results in the treatment of obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome [9, 12].",d7575ccf-4b53-4a5c-9165-f97142a1568e
13,background15," Previous results have shown that ketogenic diet can improve metabolic syndrome, reduce insulin resistance and fasting blood glucose, improve ovarian function, and help women with PCOS regain their menstrual cycles [12, 13]. In these cases, the ketogenic diet is first applied to the treatment of elderly obese female patients with stress urinary incontinence, and it is found that the ketogenic diet could effectively reduce body weight, improve the symptoms of urine leakage, and improve menopausal symptoms. We believe that the mechanism of its treatment may be the result of improving multiple factors affecting stress urinary incontinence and the interaction of various factors.  Abdominal pressure is one of factors affecting urination.With the decrease of estrogen, the body fat weight increases in the postmenopausal elderly women, and the incidence of central obesity is increased.",519b6c76-a666-469a-a85f-464ffbbfc137
14,background16," Previous epidemiological studies have confirmed the correlation between obesity and Stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The NHS study (a prospective cohort study, n = 83,355, aged 37–54) confirmed that overweight women has a significantly increased risk of urinary incontinence, with an increase in body fat mass of 1 kg and a 3% risk increase. For every increase in BMI of 1 kg/m2, the risk increased by 7% [6]. Therefore, weight loss can effectively improve stress urinary incontinence, and only a 5%-10% reduction in body mass can significantly improve the symptoms of Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) [14]. In 2020, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reviewed 39 studies of 43 populations and found that diet and exercise intervention could reduce the incidence of stress urinary incontinence by 15–18%, and pointed out that the long-term management of obesity could further reduce the incidence of urinary incontinence [15].",fe9b9f4d-5064-421b-b025-b1f23ad20cda
15,background17," Therefore, weight loss is the first-line treatment for stress urinary incontinence in obese women. In these cases, four weeks of ketogenic diet treatment can significantly reduce body weight, reduce the visceral fat area, and improve the symptoms of urine leakage and the amount of urine leakage. Therefore, the results of these cases suggest that ketogenic diet can quickly reduce body weight and intra-abdominal obesity, thereby reducing intra-abdominal pressure and the motivation for the occurrence of Stress urinary incontinence (SUI).  Urethral closure pressure and the location of the proximal urethra are also one of the factors that affect Stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Under normal circumstances, there is a rich blood supply between the smooth muscle of the urethra and the inner epithelial layer, which can thicken the mucosa and cause the natural closure of the urethral wall, thus improving the urethral static pressure.",ebcbf323-dd92-4541-91fc-7789e967947d
16,background18," The urethral epithelial mucosal vascular plexus is sensitive to estrogen, which can make the mucosal blood flow rich, soft and thick. In the absence of estrogen, poor blood supply at the submucosa can affect the tight closure of the urethra. In postmenopausal women, urethral closure pressure decreases with decreasing estrogen. A slight increase in abdominal pressure can exceed the urethral closure pressure, and urinary incontinence occurs. The patient in these cases are early menopausal women. During the ketogenic diet treatment, menopausal symptoms are significantly improved. Our previous research on women with polycystic ovary syndrome found that ketogenic diet can improve ovarian function, improve AMH level and restore menstrual cycle [9]. These results suggest that ketogenic diet can improve women’s ovarian function.",6c97a358-b09f-4bad-8874-aa4ec584186f
17,background19," For perimenopausal women, the ovarian function declines, a series of perimenopausal symptoms appear, and Kupperman score increases, which means the severity of climacteric symptoms. This study found that ketogenic diet can significantly reduce Kupperman score. Therefore, we speculate that ketogenic diet can improve ovarian function and increase urethral closure pressure and improving the symptoms of urinary incontinence. In addition, with the decline in pelvic floor function of aging women, the weak pelvic floor tissues, including the weakening of pelvic floor muscle strength, cause the proximal urethra to drop to a lower position. When the abdominal pressure increases, the pressure cannot be uniformly transmitted to the bladder and the proximal end of the urethra, but is more transmitted to the bladder, which causes the internal pressure of the bladder to exceed the closure pressure of the urethra, and urinary incontinence occurs.",b3c7f6b9-4acc-44ce-a0bc-8a2cc1f74e32
18,background20," These cases found that during the ketogenic diet treatment, the patient was given sufficient high-quality protein, protein rich in branched-chain amino acids, etc. through nutrition management. And we found that the proportion of body skeletal muscle was significantly increased, the body fat rate was significantly decreased. Based on the previous research results, we believe that the ketogenic diet can effectively reduce the body fat rate and improve the proportion of body skeletal muscle. Therefore, we speculate that the ketogenic diet may improve the pelvic floor muscle strength and restore the urethral position, thereby reducing the occurrence of stress urinary incontinence. However, this speculation still needs to be confirmed by subsequent studies.  In summary, this is the first report on the therapeutic effect of ketogenic diet on Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in obese women.",ffdc4546-62a5-44ce-b105-4e2928f2830a
19,background21," It is found that ketogenic diet can significantly improve urine leakage, reduce body weight, decrease visceral fat area, improve proportion of body skeletal muscle, and reduce BMI. Its mechanism may be related to the reduction of abdominal pressure and the restoration of the location of the urethra. However, its mechanism still needs further researches to confirm. This study is an observational study of 5 cases reports, with a small number of cases, so there are some limitations. In the future, we hope to verify the effectiveness of ketogenic diet in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence through prospective randomized controlled studies. This report reveals that ketogenic diet may become one of the effective methods for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence in obese women in the future, providing a minimally invasive, highly profitable and highly compliant treatment for stress urinary incontinence in obese women.",d4b0e0ef-cb29-4a8e-8138-47cb3069db64
