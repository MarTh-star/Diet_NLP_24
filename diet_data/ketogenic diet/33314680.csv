0,background0," Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD))) is currently a promising approach for the treatment of obesity. However, little is known about the side effects since most of the studies reporting them were carried out in normal weight subjects following Ketogenic Diet for other purposes than obesity. Thus, the aims of the study were: (1) to investigate the safety of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) in subjects with obesity; (2) if Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD))-related side effects could have an impact on its efficacy.

1,methods0," Subjects  We prospectively recruited 106 (12 males and 94 females, body mass index (BMI) 34.98 ± 5.43 kg/m2) consecutive patients clinically referred for weight loss treatment at the Centro Italiano per la cura e il Benessere del paziente con Obesità (C.I.B.O), Endocrinology Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University Federico II of Naples (Italy), from March 2021 to September 2021. The study has been approved by the Local Ethical Committee (n. 50/20) and carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments that involved humans. The aim of the study was clearly explained to all the study participants and a written informed consent was obtained.  Inclusion criteria were: age 18 years or older, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, naive subjects, i.e. who had not already tried treatment with anti-obesity drugs or bariatric surgery.",a8788104-7678-45aa-b160-59dd1d2435f1

The anthropometric measurements were performed by the same operator, according to the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK 2006). All the anthropometric measurements were taken with subjects only wearing light clothes and without shoes. Body weight was determined to the nearest 0.1 kg while using a calibrated balance beam scale (Seca 711; Seca, Hamburg, Germany) as well as height was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm with a wall-mounted stadiometer (Seca 711; Seca, Hamburg, Germany). In each subject, weight and height were measured to calculate the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) [weight (kg)/height2 (m2)]. body mass index (BMI) was classified according to World Health Organization’s criteria with normal weight: 18.5–24.9 kg/m2; overweight, 25.0–29.9 kg/m2; grade I obesity, 30.0–34.9 kg/m2; grade II obesity, 35.0–39.9 kg/m2.

Finally, the Weight Loss Percentage (Weight Loss Percentage (WLP)) was calculated using the following formula: Weight Loss Percentage (WLP) (%) = [(Starting Weight−Current Weight)/Starting Weight] × 100. Measurements were taken at baseline and at each end step of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) protocol. Participants who habitually exercised at least 30 min per day (YES /NO) were defined as physically active.  Laboratory assay  In a subgroup of 25 subjects with obesity we assessed biochemical parameters. Blood samples were collected by venipuncture between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. after an overnight fast. Samples were then transferred to the local laboratory and handled according to the local standards of practice.",2d09f26e-0e01-4bee-95e4-fad98bbf4588
5,methods4," Insulin, glucose, HbA1C, lipid profile, electrolytes, uric acid, liver enzymes, and renal function were measured. The HOMA-IR [fasting glucose (mmol/l) × fasting insulin (mU/ml)/22.5] was also calculated for each subject, as previously detailed [25]. The Glomerular Filtration Rate (Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)) was calculated as follows: eGlomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) (ml/min/ 1.73 m2) = 175 × serum creatinine −1.234 × age −0.179 (× 0.742 if female) (× 1.212 if black) [26]. Ketosis was confirmed by the detection of acetoacetate in urine using commercially available urine reagent strips (Ketur test, Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland).  Nutritional intervention  Subjects who met the inclusion criteria underwent to the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) with the use of replacement meals following a protocol consisting in three stages: active, re-education, and maintenance. The replacement meals used for all subjects were from the same company.",3287239b-0cb1-4757-990e-a33a4c90beb4
6,methods5," After the anthropometric assessment, the diet was prepared by qualified nutritionists and prescribed by the endocrinologist. The Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) provided a total daily energy intake of < 800 kcal depending on the quantity and quality of the preparations. The breakdown of macronutrients was as follows: ≃ 13% glucides, generally less than 30 g/day; ≃ 43% protein, daily protein intake of about 1.2–1.5 g/kg ideal body weight, ≃ 44% lipids, olive oil predominating. The Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) was based on protein from high biological value preparations derived from peas, eggs, soy and whey. Each protein preparation consisted of approximately 18 g protein, 4 g carbohydrates, 3 g fat (mainly vegetable oils with a high oleic acid content) and provided approximately 100–150 kcal. The weight loss program was structured in several phases.",597146d6-922a-405a-9265-17a85678db47
7,methods6," During Phase 1 (21 days), patients consumed 4–6 protein preparations (depending on ideal body weight) and low-carbohydrate vegetables, establishing the state of ketosis. In subsequent phases, the state of ketosis was still maintained. During Phase 2 (30 days) 1/2 of the meals provided (lunch and/or dinner) were gradually replaced by meals based on natural proteins (meat/fish/eggs/soy). The ketogenic period (Phases 1–2), which provided ≃ 600–800 kcal/day, was about 50 days in total. As it is a very low calorie diet, it is recommended to provide patients with micronutrients (vitamins, such as complex B vitamins, vitamins C and E, minerals, including potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium and omega-3 fatty acids) according to international recommendations.  Side effects assessments  The assessment of side effects was carried out through a questionnaire, periodic physical examination and laboratory assessment.",1b77a994-bad4-4d8a-9a56-75bf75baeba8
8,methods7," The questionnaire was formulated reporting all the side effects already known to be associated with KD although in other setting of subjects i.e. migraine, dry mouth, dizziness, low blood pressure, visual disturbances, low blood sugar, lethargy, halitosis, diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting/nausea, hyperuricemia, urolithiasis, gallbladder disease, hair loss [13, 27]. It has been proposed a preliminary version of the questionnaire that was first tested in 10 patients, who were asked to comment on any aspect (content, wording and choice of answer). Questions that were ambiguous, misunderstood or rarely answered were reformulated. This resulted in a final version of 15 questions.",1978188d-c46f-4efb-8606-cbb38b26c915
9,methods8," This list of 15 potential side effects was administered and it included headache, dry mouth, dizziness, low blood pressure, visual disturbances, low blood sugar, lethargy, halitosis, diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting/nausea, hyperuricemia, urolithiasis, gallbladder disease, hair loss and whether the diet was stopped early (and why) than the end of the protocol. All questions used nominal variables (YES/NO) and were completed with information on the day of onset and duration of symptoms. Finally, information was also collected on how the symptom was managed and whether drugs and/or supplements were taken. Subjects were screened for side effects at the end of ketogenic phase.

13,discussion0," Due to the imminent increase in obesity prevalence [1], effective strategies for weight loss and weight maintenance are needed. Although bariatric surgery is an effective treatment option for patients with obesity, its invasiveness, high costs, long waiting lists and potential complications limit its widespread use [8]. Therefore, pharmacological and lifestyle-based treatments are a valuable option for most patients with obesity [6]. Although new anti-obesity drugs are constantly coming onto the market, they still have some limitations, such as not inconsiderable cost, potential side effects and contraindications, which make them unsuitable for all people with obesity [6]. In addition, dietary regimens are often characterized by limited efficacy in weight loss and poor adherence in the majority of patients [28]. Alternative dietary strategies have been introduced to achieve greater weight loss and adherence.",b15d00fc-1579-43b6-b663-741e958da6e3
14,discussion1," Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) has been demonstrated to be a valid approach in people affected by obesity, since it promotes satiety, rapid weight loss, and muscle sparing [13]. Nevertheless, a major area of concern is the side effects of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)). None of the studies carried out in subjects with obesity have been designed to specifically investigate the side effects.  In this prospective study we found the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) is a safe and effective tool for weight loss and metabolic improvement in subjects with obesity. Interestingly, no severe side effects occurred in our population. In addition, those that did occur were clinically mild and they did not result in the interruption of the dietary protocol as they could be easily managed by healthcare professionals or often resolved spontaneously.",536b56e9-c39a-4783-9fc4-bbf7a02f06c5
15,discussion2," The supplementation with vitamins, such as complex B vitamins, vitamin C and E, minerals, including potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium; and omega-3 fatty acids was adequate to prevent any deficiency. Furthermore, we found that Weight Loss Percentage (WLP) was similar in those who developed side effects and those who did not (Fig. 1). Thus, the onset of side effects does not have any impact on the efficacy and on the adherence to the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)).  The most common side effects that were reported were lethargy (46.2%), halitosis (46.2%), headache (45.3%), dry mouth (43.5%), constipation (28%), hypotension (17.9%), dizziness (16%), vomiting/nausea (15.1%), hair loss (15.1%), diarrhoea (12.3%), hyperuricemia (10.4%) and visual disturbances (4.7%).",27fb58ae-9305-44b3-8a76-9fe21890a30a
16,discussion3,"  Ketone bodies, which are normally produced during the active phase of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)), are excreted via frequent and increased urination. This can lead to dehydration and a loss of electrolytes [29]. In a RCT comparing the efficacy and tolerability of the non-fasting KD (N = 41) and the initial fasting KD (N = 83) in children with intractable epilepsy, moderate dehydration occurred in both groups [30]. Dehydration-related disorders are mostly represented by a dry mouth, headache, dizziness/orthostatic hypotension, lethargy, and visual disturbances [22]. Thus, it is mandatory to recommend a proper water intake (at least 2 L daily), in particular during the ketogenic state. Headache was common in our patients and generally occurred in the first week.",b3b7bec2-d471-4740-86e9-0babc023930f
17,discussion4," In order to relieve headache, it could be recommended to take mild analgesics as pills instead of liquid formulations because they could contain sugar that could interrupt ketogenic state. However, it should be notice that Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD))-related headache was a short term. A considerable proportion (17.9%) of subjects also experienced hypotension thus carefully monitoring of blood pressure, increasing salt intake when there were no contraindications and the adjustment of antihypertensive drugs in subjects with hypertension is advisable during Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)). Another possible effect of dehydration that we have found in our population is an increase in sodiemia. This is mostly due to dehydration, although the serum sodium levels did not reach pathological values and remained in the normal ranges.  Halitosis was very frequent in our subjects (46.2%).",329d8d91-5038-471a-8598-78bece9cd7c9
18,discussion5," Individuals who underwent to a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) often report bad breath with a fruity smell once they reach full ketosis. Indeed, in a study of 12 healthy adults who ate four ketogenic meals over 12 h, the increase in ketone levels, and in particular the increase in acetone, acted as a predictor of ketosis [31]. Chewing sugar-free gum and/or candy and specific oral spray or mouthwash has been used as a successful strategy to manage this discomfort.  Nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are the most common gastrointestinal (GI) side effects of a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) as we also found in our study [constipation (28%), vomiting/nausea (15.1%), diarrhoea (12.3%)] and as already have been reported in studies carried out in normal weight subjects [32–34].",59d4e699-5534-493c-9e55-57f4346d92fd
19,discussion6," In an RCT, 77 healthy participants were randomized to receive a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)), a low-carbohydrate diet or a low-carbohydrate diet containing 5%, 15% and 25% total energy from carbohydrates, respectively, for 3 weeks [32]. Statistically significant increase in diarrhoea and constipation severity was observed in the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) group [32]. In a prospective study of 147 children with refractory epilepsy conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 6 months KD treatment, the second most common side effect of dietary treatment was diarrhoea [34]. In another similar study of 12 adults with refractory epilepsy treated with KD for 4 months, mild side effects included nausea/vomiting, constipation, and diarrhoea [33]. Diarrhea could be due to defective absorption and intolerance of fat [35].",5cb65f8f-72ee-40d9-a475-2a5ccfdc7331
20,discussion7," The high content of lipids can slow gastric emptying, favoring gastroesophageal reflux disease, nausea, and vomiting [35]. For the management of these symptom, it is advisable the intake of small and frequent meals, sporadic use of GI medications such as antiemetics, GI tract regulators and antacids. A decreased in water intake, fiber, and/or the volume of food can cause the onset to constipation [36]. If this was the case, it should be increased water and fiber intake and, in severe cases, the administration of low-calorie osmotic laxative is needed.  Some subjects developed hyperuricemia (10.4%) during the ketogenic phase. However, the occurrence of this adverse event is in line with what has already been reported in a systematic review of 45 studies on the safety and tolerability of the KD used for the treatment of refractory childhood epilepsy, in which hyperuricemia was reported as one of the most frequent side effects [37].",1c059324-39d6-4c06-984e-56ed79fa7dd9
21,discussion8," Serum uric acid is known to increase in individuals following a KD [38, 39]. To counteract this side effect, increasing water intake and, where necessary, allopurinol therapy are recommended.  Hair loss has been reported by 15.1% of enrolled subjects. Significantly negative nitrogen balance can be responsible for the hair loss that occurs during Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) [40]. If body protein and dietary protein mobilization are inadequate to meet the requirements, telogen effluvium is due to the low priority of hair growth of the available proteins [41]. However, hair loss is temporary, and hair regrows while weight stabilizes. Increased protein intake during Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) to balance nitrogen levels helps prevent or attenuate hair loss.",1d9dfae0-98cf-4495-bc08-5e1fa5782872
22,discussion9,"  In addition, the relative protein excess typical of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) has been of great concern among clinicians due to its potential for kidney damage. To investigate this safety outcome Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) was evaluated. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) was not affected by dietary intervention and no differences were observed between baseline and end of ketogenic phase. Recent evidence suggest that the impact of dietary protein on renal function may depend on the protein source, with red meat intake being detrimental in a dose-dependent manner, and other protein sources such as poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products showing no such deleterious effect [42]. In addition, studies evaluating protein sources of plant origin (soy and plant derivatives) appear to show that these may even play a protective role on kidney [43, 44].",b86aa904-484e-4ae3-85dc-7e09ea285a62
23,discussion10," The early stages of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) are based on meal replacements; the protein source of meals is whey and vegetable origin, and—when in the later stages the reintroduction of other protein sources takes place—patients are recommended to favour fish and poultry. The protein intake is never more than 1.5 g/kg/ideal body weight. It therefore seems reasonable to assume that such a dietary intervention is unlikely to have deleterious effects on kidney in individuals with obesity during the ketogenic phase.  The effect of the KD on lipid profile and cardiovascular risk is still debated due to concerns that the frequent increase in animal fat intake may counteract the beneficial effects of weight loss. Regarding the lipid profile, we found out that total cholesterol and high density lipoproteins (HDL) significantly decreased from baseline to the end of ketogenic phase.",7b664ac9-9a4a-4b01-8d28-26d1c338fe94
24,discussion11," An important element in increasing high density lipoproteins (HDL) levels is physical exercise [45], and the reduction in high density lipoproteins (HDL) concentration we observed in our subjects is therefore probably due to the recommendation to reduce it in the ketogenic phase as it is characterized by a strong hypocaloric condition. However, a subsequent re-establishment in high density lipoproteins (HDL) levels can be expected in the reintroduction phase as reported in other previous studies [46, 47]. No significant changes were observed in mean low density lipoproteins (LDL) and mean TG levels, probably due to the prolonged ingestion of high lipid intake.",7ed997cd-8bd2-4c8b-8505-9e2eb26aa6c7
25,discussion12," In this regard, a systematic review of 107 studies found no adverse effects on serum lipid parameters, blood pressure, or fasting blood glucose in adults who followed a diet containing less than 60 g/day of carbohydrate [48], although the analysis was complicated by heterogeneity and lack of studies, particularly those that evaluated diet use for > 90 days. A 56-week study of a KD in men with obesity (N = 66) who lost 26% of their body weight found significant reductions in total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins (LDL), and TG and increases in high density lipoproteins (HDL) [49]. The positive changes were greater in subjects with hyperlipidemia at baseline [49]. Even in studies of normal-weight subjects (N = 20) with minimal weight loss, slight to moderate increases in total cholesterol and low density lipoproteins (LDL) levels were seen in the KD groups [18]. These changes occurred as early as 3 weeks and appeared to return to baseline after 6 weeks in at least one study [18].",49e39434-d12e-417d-ae58-41358b856025
26,discussion13,"  KD is also an effective tool for improving glycaemic control variables [50, 51]. In a study of 64 subjects with obesity and high blood glucose levels on a KD for 56 weeks, glucose levels showed significant improvement at the end of treatment [51]. Another study of 363 subjects with overweight or obesity investigated the beneficial effects of the low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) compared with the low-calorie diet in improving glycemic parameters [50]. Both treatments were associated with a reduction in blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin but changes were more significant in subjects who were on the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) [50]. Likewise, in our subjects, fasting plasma glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR shows an improving trend despite not reaching statistically significant levels.",ab824ee2-cd18-4659-af9a-ea49ccc297ea
27,discussion14," This is probably due to the drastic reduction in carbohydrates of ketogenic phase, which in turn reduces insulin concentrations and encourages the use of stored fat as fuel, as well as significantly reducing insulin resistance [52].  Finally, there were no differences in Weight Loss Percentage (WLP) between subjects who developed side effects and those who did not. Thus, the occurrence of side effects did not affect efficacy or compliance with Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) probably because they were very mild and easily managed. To our knowledge, there are no other studies in the literature that have evaluated the impact that Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) side effects might have on the efficacy of dietary treatment.",be3f9e9b-9c66-429d-8243-be7e3832772b
28,discussion15,"  Conclusions  Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) appears to be an ideal therapeutic tool for people with obesity, particularly those who have already tried other nutritional strategies without success and/or who have a rapid need to lose weight (people with obesity with joint diseases, people with obesity with indications for bariatric surgery, people with obesity with cardiovascular risk factors, etc.). In spite of common misgivings, side effects are mild and preventable thanks to the indications and contraindications provided for Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Vlow carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)), by following organised and standardised protocols, and by careful clinical and laboratory monitoring. For this reason, supervision by a healthcare professional is indispensable.",b386f6d5-2802-4af0-85dd-41a6583a7a37
