0,methods0," Search strategy  The present systematic review was conducted following the general principles established by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA)) and the Institute of Medicine Standards for Systematic Review (Liberati et al. 2009). We perfermed the search of a five-year period, from 2016 to 2021, as in the last five years expanded newborn screening has become extensively available (and used) in most of the Western countries. We collected data from PubMed/Medline and Scopus database using the following MeSH terms: “Inborn error of metabolism AND neonatal seizures”.  We included all the studies describing patients with neonatal (i.e. 0–28 days) seizures caused by Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM)S and/or describing neonatal seizures demonstrated by EEG findings. All the studies had to be written in English language and conducted in humans.",efcea6ac-aaa7-4fb7-a71f-7e098db6b9c0
1,methods1,"  Studies published before 2016 and describing patients older than 28 days were excluded, as well as those reporting patients affected by diseases diagnosed with Tandem Mass. We excluded also reviews, meta-analysis and descriptive studies not including patients.  Description  Our PUBMED search for “Inborn Errors of Metabolism and neonatal seizures” identified 1158 articles. After reviewing the titles and abstracts of these articles, we reviewed the full texts of 231 articles and rejected studies matching the exclusion criteria. Eight of these fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the review. Moreover, analysing the references of the eight selected articles, we added three other relevant articles to the review. For this reason, a total of 11 articles were finally included in our review (Fig. 1).Fig.",5790cdeb-e628-4de3-b0ee-a2c7e14fffc8

3,results0," Given the lack of robust evidence and the rarity of the topic discussed, only case reports were collected from the scientific literature and therefore included in our systematic review.  A total of 13 cases of infants with neonatal seizures caused by Inborn Errors of Metabolism have been collected from literature data during the period of 2016 to 2021 in 11 studies (Table 1).Table 1 Relationship between treatment and neurological outcome  AUTHORS	STUDIES	IEOM	CLINICAL FEATURES OF SIZURES	EEG	FIRST TREATMENT	RESOLUTION OF SEIZURES	OTHER TREATMENTS	AGE AT ONSET	NEUROLOGICAL OUTCOME	 Hande et al.(Gazeteci-Tekin et al. 2019)	case report	Pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE)	infantile spasms, status epilepticus with generalized seizures	INTERICTAL EEG: burst suppression pattern	Common AEDs	yes	B6 vitamin 30 mg/kg/d	5 month of life	severe hypotonia, severe intellectual disability and motor delay	 Cirillo et al.(Cirillo et al.",c7dea92f-df3d-4527-9b37-7e45ec8cf338

In ten patients, only an intercritical EEG was performed, while three patients underwent a full video-EEG record. The clinical features of seizures were different and could manifest as infantile spasms, tonic, tonic–clonic seizures, myoclonic seizures, low-oxygen saturation, apnea and eye rolling with ""arm bicycling""- like movements.

9,results6," Five initially had resolution of seizures while other five did not respond to the treatment.  In only three patients, seizures were treated with first-line targeted metabolic treatment, before the occurrence of drug resistance. Among them, one did not respond while two had resolution of seizures.  The evaluation of the neurological outcome showed a developmental delay in 53.8% of patients while it was normal in 38.5%. At follow-up all patients except one were evaluated, but seven of 13 patients died. ",28a4f6d3-6954-4fe1-b023-e433fbbba95c
10,discussion0," Inborn errors of metabolism (Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM)) are a rare cause of epilepsy, even if seizures and epilepsy are frequently present in patients with Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM). The diagnosis of those Inborn Error of Metabolism (Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM)s) not included in the Expanded Newborn Screening (ENS) with tandem mass can be a real challenge for clinicians but seems to have a key-role for therapeutic purposes, in particular for the risk of recurrence and for the neurological outcome.  The aim of our revision of the literature was to investigate those rare Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM)s not included in the Expanded Newborn Screening (ENS) (e.g. hypophosphatasia, Molybdenum-Cofactor Deficiency, GLUT1-Deficiency Syndrome).  We found that seizures have an early onset; in fact, in all patients, they started in the first week of life. Seizures can present themselves clinically in a very different way.",70a2a788-4539-46f2-8081-b59d1a13abd6
11,discussion1," It is remarkable that it’s uncommon to have NS as isolated presentation of Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM)s, rather in this patients NS present usually in variable combinations with other clinical and neurological manifestations that should be investigated.  Physical examination can reveal typical features of Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM)s such as microcephaly or plagiocephaly (Pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE), Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency (MCD), CLN10); dysmorphisms: enophthalmos, narrow bifrontal diameter (Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency (MCD)); muscle tone alterations, especially hypotonia; cried with a high-pitched voice; signs of rickets: craniotabes, rachitic rosary, scoliosis, and Harrison-groove thoracic deformity (HP). In seven patients, major neurological signs such as microcephalia, axial hypotonia with peripheral hypertonia and hyperreflexia, motor delay, and intellectual disability were found.",bf9b1b34-70cb-4372-932a-d451611bc209
12,discussion2," Five patients showed feeding problems as indirect signs of neurological involvement. In our study 12 of 13 patients presented more or less severe neurological alterations, while only one patient did not present any apparent impairment of the Nervous System.  From our systematic review it also emerged that until now there is not a clear diagnostic protocol to follow to detect these rare but insidious Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM)s, not usually screened with tandem mass.  For this reason, in this study we have included a flow-chart summarizing the diagnostic process we usually performed in our NICU to make a correct and timely diagnosis of these diseases (Table 2).",a4a83a93-b1ef-4660-8cf4-64bd29ed6fe4

14,discussion4,"  Ten out of 13 infants were treated with common antiseizure drugs (phenobarbital, phenytoin, levetiracetam, clonazepam, vigabatrin, diazepam, midazolam). Among these, five responded to the therapy, showing at first resolution of seizures.  This data, which may seem apparently encouraging, on the contrary caused a delay in the diagnosis of the withstanding metabolic disease responsible for seizures, leading to important consequences in the neurological outcome of these newborns.  In this regard, in all these five infants who responded, at first, to the common antiseizure drug therapy, alterations such as intellectual disability, motor delay up to severe neurological abnormalities were found at the follow-up.  In these infants, therefore, seizures occurred in the following months, leading to a thorough diagnostic investigation that revealed Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM)s as their original aetiology. A target therapy was then started with B6 vitamin (os or i.v.",e71e5b4d-ecd4-4f10-9577-877fdaaba45d
15,discussion5,") at maximum dosage, or with a ketogenic diet showing a total resolution of seizures (Falsaperla et al. 2020). Nevertheless, their neurological development was already compromised.  In the other five cases resistant to antiepileptic therapy, more in-depth investigations were necessary, making it possible to reach an early diagnosis and therefore an early start of the specific therapy. In these newborns, the neurological outcome was normal in 60% of cases.  Among the studied patients, 23% received specific therapy for the disease as their first treatment (Pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE): B6 vitamin at a dosage of 100 mg once daily os; HPH: B6 vitamin at the following dosage: 40 mg/kg/day i.v.)(Gospe 2010)(Pietz et al. 1993).  In all of these five cases, we observed a total resolution of seizures and a good neurological outcome. Only one patient showed mental retardation.",bf508d68-91a9-41ca-b0cc-4fb91c5890fa
16,discussion6," In the latter case, the starting dosage of B6 vitamin was below the therapeutic value, then increased after one month of therapy (Yeghiazaryan et al. 2012).  Strengths and limits  Strengths of this review are the broad search strategy, the reporting data according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) and the result of “high quality review” assessed using the “Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2” (AMSTAR 2) criteria.  Nevertheless, some limitations may have influenced our study selection and results. Only case report in literature were available to meet our inclusion criteria about seizures caused by Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM)s not screened with tandem mass. Numerous studies were excluded because the seizures were only clinical and not EEG proven. Finally, language bias may have occurred by excluding non-English articles.",b81535ec-066e-4808-aa56-9813f09f0a5f
17,discussion7,"  Conclusion  Neonatal seizures could be included among the first clinical signs of Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM)s. Considering the underlying metabolic derangement, NS due to Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM)s not diagnosed with tandem mass can partially respond to conventional treatments delaying the diagnosis of Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM) with important consequences on the neurological development of the infant.  The current guidelines also indicate the start of treatment with B6 vitamin or ketogenic diet only after evidence of drug resistance, causing an increase of this delay.  Therefore, it is essential to suspect this metabolic form, to pay attention to the first- and second-line tests and to promptly start the appropriate diagnostic investigations.",b5fcf03e-e1f1-4085-9c44-52f1a4b25e04
18,discussion8," It is also important to introduce trials with pyridoxine, pyridoxal phosphate and Ketogenic diet, before the onset of drug resistance, with a prompt diagnostic work-up, since the diagnosis in these cases is primarily based on a clinical suspicion. This would reduce neurological impairment.  Prompt diagnosis and the onset of appropriate therapy may improve prognosis, neurological outcome and in some cases avoid death; also in cases where a specific therapy is not available, diagnosis will be crucial for family counselling.
