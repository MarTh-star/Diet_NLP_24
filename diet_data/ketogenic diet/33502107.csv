0,abstract0," Blood vessel formation is dependent on metabolic adaption in endothelial cells. Glucose and fatty acids are essential substrates for ATP and biomass production; however, the metabolism of other substrates remains poorly understood. Ketone bodies are important nutrients for cardiomyocytes during starvation or consumption of carbohydrate‐restrictive diets. This raises the question whether cardiac endothelial cells would not only transport ketone bodies but also consume some of these to achieve their metabolic needs. Here, we report that cardiac endothelial cells are able to oxidize ketone bodies and that this enhances cell proliferation, migration, and vessel sprouting. Mechanistically, this requires succinyl‐CoA:3‐oxoacid‐CoA transferase, a key enzyme of ketone body oxidation. Targeted metabolite profiling revealed that carbon from ketone bodies got incorporated into tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates as well as other metabolites fueling biomass production.",5a8dd773-a868-4cf4-b93d-49a5374fa5d9
1,abstract1," Elevation of ketone body levels by a high‐fat, low‐carbohydrate ketogenic diet transiently increased endothelial cell proliferation in mouse hearts. Notably, in a mouse model of heart hypertrophy, ketogenic diet prevented blood vessel rarefication. This suggests a potential beneficial role of dietary intervention in heart diseases.  Vascular endothelial cells are shown to be capable of taking up and oxidizing ketone bodies, which enhances cell proliferation, migration and vessel sprouting.  angiogenesis endothelial cell heart ketogenic diet ketone bodies Subject Categories  Cardiovascular System Metabolism Vascular Biology & Angiogenesis Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)) 10.13039/501100001659 394046768‐SFB1366 source-schema-version-number2.0 cover-date07 April 2022 details-of-publishers-convertorConverter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.1.3 mode:remove_FC converted:07.04.2022 EMBO Mol Med (2022) 14 : e14753.",77e00658-cdb8-4de2-a50d-6235f066cc76
2,abstract2," ==== Body pmcThe paper explained  Problem  Ketone bodies are produced by the liver, for example, during starvation and are an important source for energy production in heart and brain. Endothelial cells are located at the interface between blood and parenchymal cells and thereby are intimately involved in the transport of ketone bodies. Whether vascular endothelial cells are able to use ketone bodies was not known, however, it was shown before that lymphatic endothelial cells can break down ketone bodies and that this stimulates lymphangiogenesis.

3,introduction0," Expansion of the blood vessel network is prerequisite not only for development but also in the adult organism during tissue growth, regeneration, or wound healing. While insufficient blood vessel formation prevents regeneration of ischemic tissue, excessive and deregulated angiogenesis is implicated in several ocular diseases and cancer (Potente et al, 2011). In the last years, it became clear that angiogenesis is not only coordinated by growth factors and signaling transduction pathways but is also dependent on adaption in cellular metabolism (Eelen et al, 2018). For example, sprouting of new vessel branches is dependent on increased glycolysis (De Bock et al, 2013; Schoors et al, 2014), whereas fatty acid beta‐oxidation (fatty acid beta‐oxidation (FAO)) is key for biomass generation and endothelial cell (EC) proliferation (Schoors et al, 2015). Also, lymphatic EC proliferation, migration, and sprouting rely on fatty acid beta‐oxidation (FAO) (Wong et al, 2017).",d2821ca4-7e6d-473d-9752-87140b854c3d
4,introduction1," A recent study reported that lymphatic ECs can not only oxidize fatty acids but also ketone bodies and that this promotes formation of new lymphatic vessels in mice (Garcia‐Caballero et al, 2019; Puchalska & Crawford, 2019). However, it has not yet been reported whether also vascular ECs can take up and oxidize ketone bodies and if this would affect their angiogenic properties.  Ketone body metabolism enables mammals to endure periods of carbohydrate restriction. During starvation, intensive endurance sports or consumption of carbohydrate‐restrictive diets, glycogen stores get depleted and insulin levels decline. This stimulates lipolysis of triacylglycerides in adipocytes and release of free fatty acids and glycerol into the bloodstream.",236e8ee7-aba3-455a-a82a-0834c4a756ef
5,introduction2," Free fatty acids are taken up by non‐adipocytes and broken down into acetyl‐CoA moieties via fatty acid beta‐oxidation (FAO) to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (tricarboxylic acid (TCA)) cycle, thereby contributing to energy production (Puchalska & Crawford, 2017). In the liver, however, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates are shunt into gluconeogenesis in situations of glucose deprivation. This results in a surplus of acetyl‐CoA in hepatic mitochondria whenever fatty acid beta‐oxidation (FAO)‐derived acetyl‐CoA exceeds flux through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Under these circumstances, acetyl‐CoA molecules are enzymatically converted into the ketone bodies acetoacetate and β‐hydroxybutyrate (Puchalska & Crawford, 2021). In the healthy, fed state serum ketone body (acetoacetate and β‐hydroxybutyrate) concentrations in humans are low (50–200 µM).",5e7ed23f-8cee-4c79-8d31-bb40c57ddac0
6,introduction3," Physiological ketosis, for example, during starvation increases serum ketone body concentrations to around 1–2 mM, whereas pathological ketosis, as observed in untreated type 1 diabetes patients, is characterized by very high serum ketone body concentrations up to 20 mM (Robinson & Williamson, 1980).  Newly synthesized ketone bodies are released from hepatocytes into the bloodstream and function as energy‐rich alternative metabolic fuel in particular for heart and skeletal muscle. The rate of ketone body oxidation in extrahepatic organs increases proportionally to serum ketone body concentrations. In myocytes, D‐β‐hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1) catalyzes the oxidation of β‐hydroxybutyrate, the predominant ketone body molecule in blood, to acetoacetate. Acetoacetate is then transferred onto CoA through the activity of succinyl‐CoA:3‐oxoacid‐CoA transferase (succinyl‐CoA 3‐oxoacid‐CoA transferase (SCOT), encoded by 3‐oxoacid CoA‐transferase 1 (Oxct1)).",5b525530-83da-46af-b814-8cb678acdc0e
7,introduction4," Acetoacetyl‐CoA can then catalyzed by mitochondrial thiolase into acetyl‐CoA fueling the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy production (Cotter et al, 2013).  Notably, ketone bodies and other circulating nutrients need to pass the endothelial barrier, the inner surface of blood vessels, before being taken up by tissue cells. Whereas the sinusoidal endothelium in the liver allows free diffusion, the continuous endothelium in, for example, muscle, lung, or brain requires transcellular transport (Augustin & Koh, 2017). This raises the question whether ECs function to transport ketone bodies from blood toward tissue cells only or whether they are also able to use ketone bodies themselves. Based upon the outstanding importance of cellular metabolism for controlling angiogenesis (Eelen et al, 2018), this study aimed at analyzing ketone body metabolism in vascular ECs.",d2c7ee98-b55a-4d0b-b391-dc7f14bb04ab

Heart, skeletal muscle, and brain are the main consumers of ketone bodies (Puchalska & Crawford, 2017) and succinyl‐CoA 3‐oxoacid‐CoA transferase (SCOT) protein was abundantly present in tissue lysates of these organs obtained from adult C57Bl/6J mice, as expected (Fig 1B and C). We also detected weak succinyl‐CoA 3‐oxoacid‐CoA transferase (SCOT) expression in adipose tissue, whereas it was not detectable in lung and liver. Expression of the oxidoreductase BDH1, which reversibly converts D‐β‐hydroxybutyrate into acetoacetate, showed a variable organ expression pattern with highest expression in the liver, the organ that is responsible for ketone body production (Fig 1B and D).",330e9cd2-0314-4599-a4d5-8614168f3102

Also, ECs derived from human umbilical cord vein (human umbilical cord vein (HUVEC)), heart, and adipose tissue expressed succinyl‐CoA 3‐oxoacid‐CoA transferase (SCOT) and BDH1 protein (Fig 1F). Analysis of single‐cell RNA sequencing data from isolated ECs of multiple murine organs (Kalucka et al, 2020) revealed that Oxct1 mRNA (encoding succinyl‐CoA 3‐oxoacid‐CoA transferase (SCOT) protein) gets transcribed in ECs of all organs analyzed.",0d831d27-7945-41e5-b4c7-297aa1f7b453

To test for potential upstream regulators of Oxct1 and Bdh1, immortalized murine cardiac ECs (murine cardiac endothelial cells (MCEC)) as well as primary human cardiac microvascular ECs and human umbilical cord vein (HUVEC)s were treated with inflammatory cytokines (IL1β, IL6, TNFα), pro‐angiogenic VEGF‐A, cultured under normoxic versus hypoxic conditions and starved versus FCS‐treated conditions. However, these experiments did not lead to the identification of an upstream regulatory factor (Appendix Fig S2).

Most importantly, 13C incorporation was observed in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, amino acids and putative purines and lipids (Fig 2C and D). The 13C incorporation rate was almost always higher in the presence of acetoacetate compared to D‐β‐hydroxybutyrate. This is most likely due to the fact that D‐β‐hydroxybutyrate oxidation requires an additional enzymatic oxidation step into acetoacetate by BDH1 (Fig 1A). Together, these data indicate that cardiac ECs take up ketone bodies to feed the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and to generate biomass.",bd488fd7-1658-49e5-b1ef-690196c595ed

42,results11," Also, the amounts of other nucleotides were not changed by addition of ketone bodies (Fig EV1K and L). As ATP cannot be sufficiently stored by cells, this finding was not surprising. In summary, the experiments shown so far revealed that ECs can uptake and oxidize ketone bodies to either produce ATP (e.g., during starvation) or biomass.  Ketone bodies promote angiogenic capacity of cultured cardiac ECs  As biomass production is key for EC growth and cell division (Eelen et al, 2018), we investigated whether the presence of ketone bodies would allow cardiac ECs to proliferate faster. In the presence of D‐β‐hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate in the culture media, murine cardiac endothelial cells (MCEC) showed higher levels of BrdU incorporation as a marker of DNA synthesis (Fig 3A and B). When cells were cultured on gold microelectrodes, elevated electrical impedance was observed, indicating increased cell proliferation rates in response to ketone body treatment (Fig 3C and D).",217dd668-e181-4361-b2a6-abbf2931ec3b

To test whether this effect is specific for D‐β‐hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, murine cardiac endothelial cells (MCEC) spheroids were cultured in the presence of other substrates which can feed into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle such as acetate, the short‐chain fatty acid butyrate, or the medium‐chain fatty acid octanoate.

48,results17," To rule out that the observed pro‐angiogenic effect of ketone bodies on cardiac ECs is based on oxidation‐independent mechanisms, we performed a series of experiments. First, murine cardiac endothelial cells (MCEC) were treated with ketone body enantiomer L‐β‐hydroxybutyrate, that is not a substrate of BDH1 and can therefore not be oxidized. Notably, only D‐β‐hydroxybutyrate (Fig 3I–K), but not L‐β‐hydroxybutyrate (Fig 3L–M) promoted tube formation capacity of murine cardiac endothelial cells (MCEC). Secondly, we addressed the possibility whether D‐β‐hydroxybutyrate would exert its functions by inhibiting class I histone deacetylases (histone deacetylases (HDAC)) as this has been shown by treating mice with high doses (Shimazu et al, 2013). In ECs, there are contradictory reports about the efficiency of D‐β‐hydroxybutyrate acting as a histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitor (Chriett et al, 2019; Li et al, 2021).",9cf78f9c-3625-4c47-8393-bbc9083d8422
49,results18," To rule out the possibility that increased angiogenic potential of murine cardiac endothelial cells (MCEC) would merely be the consequence of histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibition, murine cardiac endothelial cells (MCEC) were treated with the well‐established histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitor butyrate (Shimazu et al, 2013). In contrast to D‐β‐hydroxybutyrate, butyrate treatment had no effect on the tube formation capacity, indicating that the observed effects are unlikely to be mediated through histone acetylation (Fig 3L and M). Lastly, D‐β‐hydroxybutyrate has been shown to act as a ligand for hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor‐2 (HCA2, also known as niacin receptor‐1 (NICAR1) or GPR109A) (Graff et al, 2016). We aimed at ruling out that the proangiogenic effect of D‐β‐hydroxybutyrate would be mediated through stimulation of HCA2.

Next, we tested whether ketogenic diet would increase the number of proliferating cardiac ECs when given over a longer period. First, the number of Ki‐67‐positive ECs was determined after 4 weeks of feeding the respective diets. Again, there was a pronounced increase in Ki‐67‐positive ECs but no increase in apoptotic ECs in mice receiving a ketogenic diet (Figs 6C and EV4B).",10acedc3-0fa9-4a93-b595-4a93914e9898
63,results32," However, in mice that received ketogenic diet for 6 weeks, we could not detect in the number of proliferating ECs between the two groups anymore (Fig 6D). This indicates that ketogenic diet leads to a transient increase in cardiac EC proliferation. Consistently, we could not detect differences in the cardiac vessel density of animals kept on a ketogenic diet when compared to littermate animals kept on a control diet at different time points for up to 4 months (Figs 6E and EV4C–G). In addition, the ratio of EC to non‐EC cardiac cells was not changed. As such, ketone bodies induce a transient increase in the basal proliferation rate of cardiac ECs which does not result in an expanded blood vessel network.  Ketogenic diet does not promote EC proliferation in other organs  We wondered whether the observed transient effect of ketogenic diet on EC proliferation in the heart would also occur in other vascular beds. Therefore, the ratio of Ki‐67‐positive versus negative ECs was determined.",d4eca4be-97c4-4f2a-a8d1-60e5341b26f3
64,results33," This revealed, that 2 weeks of ketogenic diet increased EC proliferation only in the heart (Fig 6A and B) but not in skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius and soleus), brain, liver, lung, or white adipose tissue (Fig 6F).  EC turnover is low in the quiescent vasculature of organs in the adult vasculature. However, in tumors, there is a reactivation of the embryo‐fetal angiogenic program leading to high EC proliferation rates (Rafii et al, 2016; Augustin & Koh, 2017). To investigate whether ketone bodies would affect angiogenesis, B16 melanoma cells were implanted into the skin of C57Bl/6J mice, a model leading to rapid formation of new blood vessels. There were no effects on tumor EC proliferation or vessel density in mice fed a ketogenic diet. In addition, tumor growth rates were not different between both diet groups (Fig EV4H–J).",48829cc6-c30d-4f0d-a516-62840b45e0a3
65,results34,"  Proliferation of cardiac ECs is increased after pressure overload‐induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice kept on a ketogenic diet  The data suggest that ketogenic diet transiently increases the proliferation capacity of ECs specifically in the heart. Therefore, we wondered whether this might be beneficial in the diseased heart. Hemodynamic overload in response to, for example, hypertension, aortic stenosis, or myocardial infarction, can be partly compensated by a hypertrophic response. Pathological cardiac hypertrophy induces maladaptive cardiac remodeling and dysfunction characterized by vascular rarefaction amongst others (Nakamura & Sadoshima, 2018).  We therefore investigated whether feeding a ketogenic diet in a prevention trial would affect vascular remodeling in an acute pressure overload model causing cardiac hypertrophy (Fig EV5A).",69d93793-f9cf-4982-a5fd-103d8f74ec62

Parameters for contractile cardiac function were unchanged between animals fed a control or ketogenic diet in the Transverse aortic constriction (TAC)‐operated and the sham group (Fig 7A). In the control diet group, there were no differences in the percentage of proliferating cardiac ECs between the sham and Transverse aortic constriction (TAC)‐operated animals (Fig 7B and C), indicating that, as expected, cardiac hypertrophy leads to vascular rarefaction. Indeed, mice on control diet showed lower blood vessel density in the hypertrophic left ventricular wall compared to sham‐operated mice (Figs 7D and EV5D).",9ea3ea28-b1e7-4a58-9402-a87f2dac202b

71,discussion0," Ketone body metabolism is crucial for survival in situations of carbohydrate restriction. Here we report that vascular ECs, which are involved in the transport of these energy‐rich metabolites to ketone body‐oxidizing organs, oxidize ketone bodies via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. ECs display a great phenotypic plasticity that is tightly linked to their metabolic state (Potente & Carmeliet, 2017). The metabolic state of quiescent endothelial cells is characterized by high levels of anaerobic glycolysis as well as fatty acid oxidation. Activation of quiescent endothelial cells towards a proliferating or migrating phenotype requires metabolic adaptions (Wilhelm et al, 2016; Dumas et al, 2020). Angiogenic ECs further increase the rate of glycolysis, while fatty acid oxidation levels are decreased (De Bock et al, 2013). This highlights the importance of metabolic adaptions in regulating EC behavior that can even override genetic pre‐determination (Potente & Carmeliet, 2017).",3375496f-c288-44d3-b909-ebd5e73b0287
72,discussion1,"  Vascular ECs are continuously exposed to varying concentrations of ketone bodies in the blood. This raises the question whether the availability of ketone bodies affects EC behavior. We found that ketone body oxidation in ECs fuels energy as well as biomass production, resulting in increased proliferation, migration, and sprouting potential. This is in line with data from lymphatic ECs, where ketone body oxidation has comparably positive effects on lymphangiogenesis (Garcia‐Caballero et al, 2019). Mechanistically, the observed effects are dependent on ketone body oxidation via succinyl‐CoA 3‐oxoacid‐CoA transferase (SCOT). Whether also signaling events through G protein‐coupled receptors such as HCAR2 or FFAR3 (Newman & Verdin, 2017) and epigenetic modification such as histone β‐hydroxybutyrylation or histone acetylation (Ruan & Crawford, 2018) are involved in regulating EC behavior in response to ketone body exposure needs to be evaluated.",12f8993c-3939-44aa-860e-869601cfdf83
73,discussion2," However, data presented in this study argue against it.  The heart represents a major consumer of ketone bodies (Puchalska & Crawford, 2017). Elevated levels of circulating ketone bodies by administration of a ketogenic diet increased the rates of EC proliferation exclusively in the heart of healthy adult mice. This induction was transient and did not affect cardiac vascular density. However, in a pathological model of cardiac hypertrophy, proliferation rates of cardiac endothelial cells were higher in mice receiving a ketogenic diet when compared to control diet‐fed mice in the long term. Ketone body oxidation rates are known to be increased in the failing murine and human heart (Lommi et al, 1996; Aubert et al, 2016; Bedi et al, 2016). Supplementation of ketone bodies to the failing heart, either by a ketogenic diet or by direct infusion, ameliorates pathological cardiac remodeling in animal models of heart failure (Horton et al, 2019).",ed63a42d-ec13-44c2-9d71-312779f8dc48
74,discussion3," Likewise, elevating circulating ketone body levels by β‐hydroxybutyrate infusion improved cardiac function in a small cohort of heart failure patients (Nielsen et al, 2019). We did not observe a significant impairment of contractile function in our Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model, consistent with compensated hypertrophy in the applied setting. Future studies will have to address whether ketogenic diet or administration of ketone bodies in prevention and intervention trials show beneficial outcome in various animal models of heart disease.  Notably, while cardiac vessel density decreased after Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery in animals receiving a control diet, it was maintained in animals from the ketogenic diet group after Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery. Vascular rarefaction is a characteristic sign of pathological cardiac hypertrophy associated with maladaptive cardiac remodeling and dysfunction (Nakamura & Sadoshima, 2018).",6c467730-57b1-4a32-b781-2bc32d6c8d4b
75,discussion4," It has been reported that the beneficial effects of ketone body supplementation during cardiac hypertrophy are attributable to ketone body oxidation in cardiomyocytes and that administration of ketone bodies enhances the respiratory efficiency of cardiomyocytes in the failing heart (Schugar et al, 2014; Uchihashi et al, 2017; Horton et al, 2019). Data presented within this study provide a rationale for further investigating the role of endothelial ketone body oxidation in the failing heart in maintaining a stable microvessel density, preventing vessel rarefication, and eventually ensuring sufficient transport of oxygen and nutrients to cardiomyocytes in pathological conditions.
