We describe the methodology used to systematically present our findings on the effects of KDs on body composition in strength-trained participants. The protocol for this systematic review was registered in protocolos.io (DOI: https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.4r3l27m9qg1y/v1 (accessed on 31 August 2022).  2.1.

3,methods3," Data Extraction  From each selected article, information was extracted including the name of the first author, the date of publication, the average age of the participants, and the gender of both the experimental and control groups, in addition to the study design, the participants, the duration, the composition of the diet, and the means and standard deviations (SD) of both groups. Data related to body weight and fat free mass (FFM) were selected.  Additionally, any disagreement in the selection of material to be included by the two researchers (S.V.M and J.B.P) was resolved by a third researcher.  2.4. Quality Assessment  Risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Cochrane method [26]. The elements evaluated were the following: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias.",4de54a3e-d0cb-4d1d-b840-8c4316d425f2
4,methods4,"  Studies were classified as high risk of bias, low risk of bias, or unclear bias, for each item assessed, based on the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook.  RevMan Web software (London, UK) was used to develop meta-analyses. Meta-analyses were performed assessing the difference in post-intervention means and were performed with fixed effects if the heterogeneity value (I2) was less than 50%. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots.  3. Results  The flow of studies in our meta-analysis is depicted in Figure 1, from 352 possibly relevant references. Of all the investigations, one did not present a complete text, so it was discarded. References were reviewed to determine eligibility. Finally, only five investigations met the eligibility criteria. These studies included 48 participants consuming a KD diet and 53 in control groups.  The characteristics of these five randomized controlled trials are presented in Table 1.",53f74615-c50e-4c84-9d94-e6f2827a735b
5,methods5," Of these studies, four were evaluated by dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA), and one by BIA [27]. In addition, one also presented ultrasound results [28]; however, the fat free mass (FFM) data were not provided. Only one investigation did not report nutritional data, although it used an ad libitum strategy [14]. In addition, all the investigations lasted between 8 and 12 weeks; however, ref [13] a crossover study was carried out, applying 12 weeks of a KD diet, 3 weeks of wash-out, and another 12 weeks of a No-KD protocol.  None of the variables analyzed showed the existence of publication bias, and heterogeneity was 0% in all analyses.  In the total mass variable, five studies provided the necessary data, with a final sample of n = 48 participants in the intervention group and n = 48 in the control group. The mean difference with a 95% confidence interval was 0.31 (−3.15, 3.77) in favor of the control group, although the differences were not significant (p > 0.",b0596ae3-5ff9-4b17-91b7-cde8c8770f37

With regard to the fat free mass (FFM) variable, four studies were included, with a final sample of n = 35 participants in the intervention group and n = 36 in the control group. The mean difference with a 95% confidence interval was −0.57 (−3.35, 2.20) in favor of the experimental group, although the differences were not significant. (p > 0.05), as shown in Figure 3.  4. Discussion  The results of our meta-analysis did not show significant differences between the control group and the experimental group in the fat free mass (FFM) variable, although the differences between means were favorable to the experimental group. However, the meta-analysis of Koerich et al. [30] showed better results for fat free mass (FFM) for the non-ketogenic group. The difference between our work and previous studies is that it focuses on participants trained in strength, and the review of Koerich et al. [30] examined trained athletes from different sports modalities.",f4ab2528-f167-4ceb-b6bd-2b5883bea1e5
7,methods7,"  Other reviews reported increases in fat free mass (FFM) over 386 participants, although they included different populations and protocols without RT training [31]. However, the review and meta-analysis of Ashtary-Larky et al. [8], which included 13 studies with a total of 244 participants undertaking RT training and KD diets, found significant reductions in fat free mass (FFM) in the KD group. The loss of fat free mass (FFM) in the meta-analysis of Ashtary-Larky [8] may be due to the fact that, of the thirteen studies evaluated, eight were carried out ad libitum [13,14,29,32,33,34,35,36], and one of them did not report the nutritional data [37]. Therefore, only four studies included specific prescriptions for the consumption of total calories [12,27,28,38]. However, while Vargas et al. [12] initially prescribed ≈39 kcal·kg−1·d−1, there was no nutritional record; therefore, we cannot say that the participants consumed the total energy required.",49313c6a-f88e-4e13-bfe1-8eb1659f6af1
8,methods8," The same difficulty applies to the study by Rhyu et al. [38] where experimental records are unavailable. In research carried out in our laboratory [29], we checked the difference between the initial nutritional prescription and the actual record. Where the prescribed intake was ≈45 kcal·kg−1·d−1, at the end of the eight weeks, the reported mean was ≈40 kcal·kg−1·d−1, unlike the group that did not engage in a KD, who reached the prescribed calorie intake at the beginning of the study. Therefore, and given that energy surplus is currently considered the main factor in increasing muscle mass [20], we must consider the main limitation to achieving it: the satiety generated by KD diets [39,40]. In fact, ad libitum KDs have shown a lower energy consumption [40], indicating it is difficult to reach an adequate intake of calories, and thus impairing adherence to the diet.",b9225d92-1fc8-4358-a86c-d34b16e41453
9,methods9," The satiating effect of KDs that do not produce an increase in fat free mass (FFM) can optimize the reduction in fat mass [8,31]. However, when total calories are equalized, there is no additional advantage in KDs [41].  Only the investigation of Wilson et al. [28] carried out a reintroduction of carbohydrates in the post-experiment evaluation. As dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) evaluates FM and fat free mass (FFM), and the accumulation of muscle glycogen is accompanied by approximately 3 g of water, carbohydrate loading will increase the intracellular content, fat free mass (FFM) values will be higher, and the differences in the stored glycogen and associated water content will influence both total mass and fat free mass (FFM) [42]. This limitation must be considered before concluding that KDs do not cause an increase in fat free mass (FFM), especially when accompanied by RT.  However, no research has corrected for fat-free adipose tissue (fat free adipose tissue (FFAT)).",71d270bc-e00c-4ae1-838e-695be72f33c5
10,methods10," In this regard, as the amount of adipose tissue is reduced, so will fat free mass (FFM), since fat-free adipose tissue is included in the dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurement of fat-free tissue mass [43]. In fact, considering the model proposed by Heymsfield et al. [44] to reduce the difference between the fat free mass (FFM) component at the molecular level and the corresponding value measured at the macro level in the tissue/organ (e.g., MRI or dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)), it is assumed that 85% of adipose tissue is fat and the remaining 15% is fat-free adipose tissue (fat free adipose tissue (FFAT)). If the participants in our study had similar increases in fat free mass (FFM), these data would not be entirely accurate.  It should be noted that the study by Gregory et al.",ee090e98-567d-4f81-8888-242a96d8a913
11,methods11," [35] was excluded because, despite being Crossfit® athletes, the inclusion criteria specified only that the sample should be between 18 and 60 years old and have completed a minimum of one month of active training, which could not be considered advanced.  Although our results are not favorable for an increase in fat free mass (FFM) with the use of a KD, it does not mean that the cross-section of skeletal muscle cannot be increased. In fact, as mentioned, dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) evaluates FM and fat free mass (FFM); therefore, it is not a direct indicator of muscle hypertrophy. Ultrasound evaluation has proven to be a more reliable marker for this purpose [45].  For this reason, the investigation of Wilson et al. [28] used ultrasound, in addition to dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA), finding favorable effects of a KD. This was contrary to the findings of Kephard et al.",31829c46-dd48-45a0-8c09-5319c209d691
12,methods12," [14] of a decrease in muscle thickness in the legs, although that study involved the previously mentioned limitations in nutritional control.  Additionally, training focused on muscle mass gain is based on volume as the main programming variable [16], and is optimized with weekly volumes of between 16 and 24 series [46], where it can be more efficient to distribute it in frequency 2 [47].  An excess of series per session, in advanced participants, can lead to wasted sets, where protein synthesis is not optimized [48]. For this reason, an average volume would be between 8 and 12 sets/session, with up to 20 total sets per week recommended to reach the maximum recoverable volume [49]. In this way, the review in [50] found that carbohydrate consumption could improve strength performance in training volumes greater than 10 sets per session.",2e0cb1f9-2762-4e83-b924-18a207f850ce
13,methods13," Since our goal was muscle hypertrophy in advanced athletes, it does not appear that carbohydrate restriction would affect the set volume needed per session in advanced participants.  This study has some limitations. The interventions using KDs included in the meta-analysis were not exactly similar and the number of studies included in the meta-analysis was low. Thus, the results should be treated with caution and future studies should perform a protocolized and similar KD intervention.  Additionally, the use of KDs has possible side effects that must be considered in study populations. Cases of skin rash and “keto flu” have been reported, where nausea, tremors, lack of energy, vomiting, fainting, and halitosis can occur [51]. As a general rule, in non-pathological and trained subjects, as is the case in our review, the metabolic symptoms associated with the change in energy from carbohydrates to fats usually disappear in a few days.",692ca8c2-f3cb-4dc3-bbca-28aea5d44912
14,methods14,"  We must emphasize that the five selected studies met the protein ranges established for the increase in myofibril proteins (1.6 and 2.2 g kg BM·d−1 of protein) [20]. In addition, we should consider Leucine as the main amino acid in protein synthesis [52,53], being found in greater quantity in the foods chosen in these investigations (dairy, meat, fish, and eggs). However, consuming more protein, and thus more Leucine per meal, will not increase myofibrillar protein synthesis [54]. None of the selected studies established plant-based diets. For these reasons, we did not find an advantage in any selected study based on a slightly higher protein intake.  5. Conclusions  We conclude that by applying a KD diet without energy restriction, significant increases in fat free mass (FFM) can be achieved, since the total energy prevails for this objective.",a25896cf-c50b-4044-9b13-47e18962f290
15,methods15," However, due to the satiating effect and the consequent lack of adherence that a KD generates, it does not seem to be an optimal nutritional strategy, especially if it is maintained continuously for eight weeks or more. ",a0db898a-1b10-49c8-919d-fc9e9a4c7d9e
