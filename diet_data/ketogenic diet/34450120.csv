Study 1: Ketone Salt Supplementation with Acute Exercise  This project (Ketone Supplement Study or KSUPP) explored how acute ingestion of a ketone salt formulation prior to high-intensity exercise influenced the metabolic response to exercise and performance in a group of healthy recreationally trained adults [15]. In brief, this study tested the effects of a pre-workout supplement containing by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) salts, caffeine, and amino acids (KCA) in recreationally active adults habitually consuming a mixed diet (Keto-Naïve; n = 12) or a KD (Keto-Adapted; n = 12).",8fe09842-6e8c-414a-9a6c-fac727de9fc7

This study is an extension of a larger project called Tactical Athletes in Nutritional Ketosis (Tactical Athletes in Nutritional Ketosis (TANK)) designed to evaluate the feasibility, metabolic, and performance responses of an extended duration KD. Healthy adults (n = 29) from various military branches participated in a supervised 12-week progressive resistance training program. In brief, fifteen participants self-selected to an ad libitum KD guided by daily measures of capillary blood ketones and fourteen continued their normal mixed diet (MD).

Fasting/Resting by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF)  Resting capillary blood R-by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations in the Keto-Adapted group were 2-fold higher than Keto-Naïve subjects (0.70 vs. 0.33 mM). In order to assess if there were differences in fasting/resting Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) between Keto-Naïve and Keto-Adapted groups, the pre-exercise Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations were averaged between the two trials (KS & WT) in each group.",a4a68df8-caef-46b6-8210-344e5bce7704
10,methods10," A two-tailed t-test revealed that the Keto-Naïve group had 13% higher fasting Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) than the Keto-Adapted group (p = 0.03) (Table 2). The Keto-Adapted group showed greater variability than the Keto-Naïve group (range: 175–327 vs. 233–312 pg/dL) (Figure S1).  3.1.2. Post-Exercise by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF)  After ingestion of the KS, R-by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations were higher at all time points during and after exercise compared to Water (Figure 1A). The highest R-by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations occurred at IP after KS ingestion.

KA + WT had a significantly lower R-by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration than all other conditions at IP30 (p < 0.05).  Intense exercise resulted in a significant increase in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) immediately post-exercise (KA + KS, 64.1%; KA + WT, 51.9%; KN + KS, 9.0%; KN + WT, 80.9%) and 30 min into recovery from pre-intervention measurements (p < 0.001) (Figure 1B). Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) at 30 min into recovery showed an increase in all groups except KN +WT from IP concentrations (KA + KS, 7.3%, KA + WT, 8.0%, KN + KS, 25%; KN + WT, −15.2%).",4648f5af-ae56-4f85-add6-31c4f024e52c

The KN + KS condition was associated with lower Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) than KA + KS (p < 0.001) and KN + WT (p = 0.007), but not KA + WT (p = 0.214).  3.1.3. Metabolic and Hormonal Reponses  In both groups and trials, capillary glucose peaked immediately post-exercise, gradually returning to baseline levels during recovery. Plasma insulin remained stable in response to the supplement ingestions and exercise in Keto-Adapted subjects, whereas responses were more variable in Keto-Naïve subjects. 4 of the 12 individuals in the Keto-Naïve group had HOMA-IR values >1.0 compared to none in the Keto-Adapted group.  3.2.

On average participants reached nutritional ketosis (by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) ≥ 0.5 mM) in 2.9 ± 2.0 days and reported two consecutive days of nutritional ketosis 3.5 ± 2.0 days after beginning the KD [24]. Capillary by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) increased from baseline (pre) to week 12 (post) via dependent t-test (p < 0.001) (Figure 2A).

There was a high degree of variability in the Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) response with six individuals from each group showing a decrease and seven KD and 8 MD individuals showing an increase in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentration post intervention (Figure 2B).  3.2.2. Metabolic and Hormonal Responses  Glucose remained unchanged post-intervention in the KD (79.1 ± 10.7 to 74.8 ± 6.1 mg/dL) and MD (75.8 ± 5.9 to 74.8 ± 8.7 mg/dL) groups. Insulin was lower postintervention (p = 0.005), and the decrease was of greater magnitude in the KD vs. MD group (10.3 ± 4.9 to 5.7 ± 2.4 vs. 8.1 ± 4.6 to 7.3 ± 2.8 µIU/mL; p = 0.035). Insulin sensitivity improved in the KD group (2.1 ± 1.2 to 1.1 ± 0.5) and remained unchanged in the MD group (1.5 ± 0.9 to 1.4 ± 0.5) (p = 0.042) [24].",a3308bde-ba71-4732-bc14-0231936d6f3c

16,methods16,"  Plasma Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations decreased significantly from baseline starting at WK2 and then continued to decrease through WK4 and WK6 (pre: 617 ± 19 pg/dL to post: 370 ± 33, respectively) (Figure 3B). There was no significant difference between groups at any time point. Post intervention Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) values decreased in the KD + KS group by 53.4%, KD + PL by 65.5% and in the low fat diet (LFD) group by 83.4%. One participant in the KD + PL group increased 1.2% in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations from pre to post, and interestingly this person had one of the lowest Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) values at baseline.  3.3.2.

There was no significant glucose lowering effect in low fat diet (LFD). Insulin levels and insulin resistance, calculated from fasting glucose and insulin using the homeostatic model, decreased at WK2 and stayed lower at WK4 and WK6 in all groups (p < 0.001).  3.4. Study 1 vs. Study 2 vs. Study 3  When comparing the main effect size of each study, Study 3 showed the strongest difference compared to the other two studies (Table 3). The change in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) was not correlated with by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in any study. There were two significant interactions in Study 3.",de0ef0ee-0446-490f-ad8b-b0793ce0d0e5
18,methods18," A positive correlation in the KD + PL group between Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) and glucose concentration was detected (Figure S2a), while a negative correlation was found in the low fat diet (LFD) group with plasma insulin and Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations (Figure S2b). Supplementary table of Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) main effects and interactions are shown in Supplementary Table S1. No correlations were found regarding weight loss or body fat percentage and Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentration (Supplementary Table S2).  4. Discussion  Contrary to our hypothesis, the findings from three separate studies provide little support for our hypothesis that higher blood by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in healthy adults consuming either a KD and/or ketone salts would be associated with increased plasma Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF). We did however make several important discoveries.",eac2df7d-0703-4e2e-b277-6d1e3606c366
19,methods19," In Study 1 it was demonstrated that fasting/resting Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations were lower in keto-adapted than non-keto-adapted individuals. Plasma Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) increased after acute exercise regardless of starting ketone levels. Blood samples were taken within 2 min of the completion of the exercise protocol, thus capturing the immediate Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) response to intense exercise. However, in Study 2 there was no increase in fasting, resting Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) after a 12-week resistance training regimen, implying that plasma Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) may be transiently responsive to exercise but does not remain constitutively elevated.",3f75e4fd-a1d6-4731-bfe1-cd919ce0b649
20,methods20," Second, in Study 3 it was demonstrated that weight loss achieved over 6-weeks was a robust stimulus to uniformly decrease plasma Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) regardless of the macronutrient distribution of the diet or level of ketosis. Thus, circulating Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) levels can be modulated in healthy adults, but unlike the results from many animal studies [11,27] the results from our work do not support a major effect of nutritional ketosis achieved through a low-carbohydrate eating pattern or exogenous ketone consumption on plasma Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) in healthy adults.  4.1. Exercise and Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF)  The increase in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) after intense cycling exercise in Study 1 was not unexpected as previous studies have indicated an approximate 50% increase in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) after a maximal cycling protocol [28].",26692c60-2ac3-4501-95f5-af173efd891f
21,methods21," While acute exercise consistently increases Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF), the response to long term training has shown either an increase [3,22,29,30] or no change in resting Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) [31]. We demonstrated that a 12-week resistance training intervention resulted in no change in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations in the context of either a KD or MD. The lack of Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) response may be related to training status. Our subjects were enlisted ROTC cadets and cadre regularly participating in scheduled physical activity whereas studies in untrained populations [22,32] demonstrated an increase in resting Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) following chronic resistance training protocols.  4.2.",3029b949-21c2-4ef1-9482-727a8ef31b63
22,methods22," Ketones and Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF)  Ingestion of a ketone-salt that modestly increased blood by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) prior to a maximal acute exercise protocol did not further increase Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations. It is possible that a higher by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) level, achievable for example with higher dose ketone esters, could create a significant change in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) after acute anaerobic exercise as it has been published that salts elicit a smaller by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) response than ketone esters [16,33].",b1ad7b96-a908-45e5-a90b-163457696ebf
23,methods23," Two previous studies found an increase in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) after adaptation of ketosis (by both KD and acute KE ingestion), but one trial where participants were fed a mixed diet with daily ingestion of 12 g of KE thrice daily found no difference in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations after the 14 day dietary intervention [12,13,14].  The KN + KS, whose baseline values were significantly higher than the other baseline trial values, had the least amount of increase at IP by 9.0%. It should be noted that although not significant, the KN + WT was the only group to see a drop in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations at the 30 min post exercise mark (IP 426 ± 22 pg/dL, IP30 370 ± 26 pg/dL; Mean ± SD). This would be the only group in this crossover trial to not be exposed to elevated ketones. Brunelli et al.",059c7884-03e7-4c43-8eb3-4ac97dddb018
24,methods24," [28] reported a significant drop during a recovery period in the Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations of 10 healthy men who performed a cycling incremental test to exhaustion, much like the one in this protocol. It is possible that the presence of by increasing circulating ketones Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) may have deterred Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) from dropping in the recovery period. In comparison to KN + WT, recovery levels of Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) after acute exercise were significantly higher in the KA + KS group but not significantly different than the KA + WT and KN + KS groups. Further research is needed to resolve whether heightened levels of ketosis are needed to elicit a larger response in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations during recovery.",9f2110b4-be66-4887-8fa3-eacbf882e19b
25,methods25,"  With the exception of the unexpected lower resting Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) in keto-adapted individuals (Study 1), no differences were seen in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) responses between a KD and non-ketogenic diet in Studies 2 and 3. Thus, there does not appear to be a strong effect of chronic elevations in ketones on plasma Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF). None of the participants in the three studies were in a cognitive deficit, which may inhibit the potential cognitive effects that may be seen in people with schizophrenia, autism and depression [34,35,36]. This lack of change across all methods of induced ketosis, requires further research on the level of ketosis needed to achieve an increase in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) levels for populations with and without cognitive decline.  4.3.",de931387-1590-405b-9601-db3f2ed23411
26,methods26," Weight Loss and Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF)  A 6-week hypocaloric diet, irrespective of macronutrient composition, showed a highly uniform and progressive decrease in plasma concentrations of Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF). The post intervention concentrations of Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) were markedly decreased in all of the groups (KD + KS group by 53.4%, KD + PL by 65.5% and in the low fat diet (LFD) group by 83.4%) but this did not correlate with weight loss. All participants in the 3 groups demonstrated a decrease in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) except for one participant in the KD + PL group with a particularly low starting Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) who increased 1.2% from pre to post. The baseline values of these participants were almost two-fold higher than any of the other cohorts examined in this study and the post-weight loss values are comparable to those reported in other studies.",ba114e5a-77ab-4bff-8ce6-f9eedda2624d
27,methods27," Elevated Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) levels have been shown in populations with obesity or metabolic syndrome [37,38]. There has been a reported positive correlation between the number of metabolic risk factors and Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) [38] because long term exposure to metabolic risk factors lead to the central nervous system’s (central nervous system’s (CNS)) overproduction of Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF), due to its role in regulating energy management. Although the relationship between Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) and obesity has yet to be defined, obesity is associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disease [39]. By the time a person is diagnosed with a metabolically influenced cognitive disease, previously elevated Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) levels have dropped significantly [40,41,42].",c45f7125-8fbf-47de-b4ac-32c3828fa207
28,methods28," It is possible that this population saw a reduction in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) levels after weight loss due to the regulation of potential metabolic risk factors such as body fat and the decreased need for the central nervous system’s (CNS) to compensate for metabolic imbalance. Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) deficient populations, such as those who have cognitive impairment, benefit from a hypocaloric diet to help Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) regulation [43]. None of the participants had neurological problems that would necessitate a heightened need for increased Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF).  In light of the highly significant decrease in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) after weight loss in Study 2, it is somewhat perplexing that the KD group in Study 3 demonstrated no change in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF).",50b40f0c-ab80-4c9d-8071-8bb5bfdd120a
29,methods29," This discrepancy may be explained by metabolic health status with participants in Study 3 being healthier and having lower baseline (pre-intervention) Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) than Study 2. Thus, the central nervous system’s (CNS) did not need to excrete higher levels of Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) to resolve impaired metabolism. Another possible reason Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) was not decreased after significant weight loss in Study 3 may be due to the structured exercise program, which acted to counteract the expected drop in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) upon weight loss.  4.4. Exploratory Effects of Different Markers of Health on Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF)  The adult brain is dynamic, meaning that it can be changed by internal factors like neurological homeostasis but also external factors such as metabolic health [44]. Metabolism imbalance has been shown to be associated with decreased cognitive function [45].",a6e17b66-d91a-465c-a342-b3b4ad218328
30,methods30," glucose (GLU) and insulin are among two of the most prominent markers that are used in diagnosis of insulin sensitively and energy management [46,47].There is a pronounced role of Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) in the regulation of feeding and energy metabolism, therefore, the idea that metabolic imbalances can be mediated with dietary interventions can be appreciated. Increased Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations in persons with Type II Diabetes illicit increased metabolic effects such as the upregulations of neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase (TrkB) and cAMP-response element binding protein (cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)) pathways. These pathways can reduce levels of glucose (GLU) and insulin in peripheral tissues, thereby improving insulin sensitivity [48]. Both markers can be strong indicators of the capacity to utilize fatty acids in relation to insulin resistance and obesity.",1954b134-f4af-4118-a2b1-32ef59549074
31,methods31,"  Exploratory analyses of glucose (GLU) and insulin were analyzed to explain the potential effects of changes in metabolism, specifically fat, on Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF). Although both KD groups had a marked decrease in fasting glucose concentrations, a positive correlation was detected in the KD + PL group between Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) and glucose concentrations. KDs have historically been used to help regulate insulin sensitivity and ultimately, energy homeostasis, which hypothetically would allow for better neurological regulation [45], potentially leading to this positive relationship. However, the same relationship may have been blunted in the KD + KS group due to the decrease in lipolysis associated with exogenous ketone supplementation [49], which may have altered the endogenous metabolic change that is typically seen with insulin and glucose (GLU) responses after a KD intervention.",aa9814bb-5c85-4ee7-93ed-3733e30ae2c3
32,methods32," In a hypocaloric low fat diet (LFD), a negative correlation between plasma level insulin concentrations and Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) was detected. This group would not have seen the metabolic effects associated with fat oxidation that the KD did, thus, insulin may not have been well regulated, even after weight loss, leading to a decrease in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) [41,50]. Thus, further work is needed to explore the effects of changes in metabolism on Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) due to both diet variation and weight loss.  5. Conclusions  In summary, the findings of this investigation reveal that resting plasma Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) is lower in keto-adapted than non-keto-adapted individuals and that Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) is highly responsive to intense exercise protocols regardless of prior diet.",91ac4447-6ff2-47b9-a0bf-b28d3355b0bc
33,methods33," A single bout of intense cycling increased plasma level Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations, but chronic (12-week) resistance training did not significantly affect resting levels of Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) in healthy adults consuming either a KD or a MD. Lastly, it was revealed that a hypocaloric diet resulted in a consistent and marked decrease in Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) irrespective of diet composition and ketosis in overweight and obese populations. Further work is needed to determine the transient nature of plasma Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) responses to different types of exercise, the impact of volume or frequency of exercise training on resting Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) concentrations, and the role of more potent ketogenic interventions such as the KD and exogenous ketones on these responses.
