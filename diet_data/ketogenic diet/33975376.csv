18,discussion0," In this study, conventional Anterior cruciate ligament transaction (ACLT)+ partial medial meniscectomy (PMM) surgery was used to establish a rat OA model, which has the advantages of good repeatability, short modeling time, a high success rate of modeling, and the ability to simulate human OA to a large extent. Eight weeks after the operation, the knee joints of rats in the SD group showed cartilage erosions and osteophytes, while the immunohistochemical results showed significant destruction of the articular cartilage, which confirmed the successful establishment of the OA model in rats.  OA is a common age-related joint disease, with unclear pathogenesis. However, increasing evidence supports the claim that inflammation is a pathological factor of the OA process. Indeed, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are significantly increased in synovial fluids from patients with OA.",84a5d783-94d3-4caf-81c3-48ab78508dda
19,discussion1," Among them, IL-1β is considered to be the most important inflammatory factor in the pathogenesis of OA, which can further promote the release of other inflammatory substances, aggravate the inflammatory response, and eventually accelerate the destruction of the articular cartilage [18]. The effect of IL-1β on the degradation of the articular cartilage is attributed to the promotion of cartilage matrix degradation. Upregulation of IL-1β leads to high expression of MMPs, especially MMP13, which leads to irreversible destruction of the cartilage matrix [19]. Our results confirmed that OA increased the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 in the articular fluid, increased the expression of MMP13 in the articular cartilage, and decreased the level of COL2, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies.  Anti-inflammatory therapy is considered to be an effective treatment for OA.",23e6f5d0-000e-445f-821c-5a1fed4b527e
20,discussion2," Silent chondrocytes can be activated by uncontrolled inflammation and secrete proinflammatory cytokines, which also express multiple inflammatory cytokine receptors. Excessive activation of inflammation increases the expression of collagenases and aggrecanases and eventually leads to degradation of the extracellular matrix of the cartilage [20–22].  While ketone bodies have long been considered a source of circulating energy during fasting, their signaling function has only recently been recognized [13]. Recent studies have shown that ketone bodies play an anti-inflammatory role in numerous diseases [23]. A study by Rahman et al. showed that KD or βOHB induced a neuroprotective phenotype in monocytes and/or macrophages through HCA2 [24]. Zhang et al. demonstrated that ketogenesis can inhibit inflammatory macrophage activation, indicating its potential therapeutic effect in acute pancreatitis [25].",9e0389c7-ba3d-4f26-9623-13fac0692c31
21,discussion3," In addition, the ketone body βOHB downregulates Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 expression by GPR109A in murine microglial BV-2 cells [26]. We previously used the KD to treat spinal cord injury rats, suggesting that βOHB can promote the recovery of spinal cord nerve function by inhibiting the inflammatory response [11]. The implementation of a KD can effectively increase the level of the ketone body, but whether it can protect articular cartilage by inhibiting inflammation in OA rats remains unclear. The current study showed that the KD significantly reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, reduced the degradation of COL2 by inhibiting the activity of MMP13, and improved trabecular bone alterations in the metaphysis, with increases in BV/TV and Tb. Th and decreases in Tb. Sp. Finally, KD treatment significantly reduced the knee cartilage injury score of OA rats.",09f6f843-1e39-4801-b0aa-7f47ba0f171c
22,discussion4," These results confirmed the protective effect of KD on articular cartilage in OA rats, although further study is needed to elucidate its mechanism. A study by Wu X. suggested that KD compromises both the cancellous and cortical bone architecture of long bones. However, their study was significantly different from the current study in that their results were obtained by feeding mice with a KD for 12 weeks. The use of a long-term KD in mice may have contributed to the decline in BV/TV in their study, and more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis [27].  Youm et al. found that the ketone body βOHB inhibited the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in murine bone marrow macrophages by inhibiting intracellular K+ outflow and associated speck like protein (ASC) oligomerization [28]. Furthermore, βOHB improved NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as Muckle-Wells syndrome, spinal cord injury, and gout flares, and reduced caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion.",f00216d8-2426-458d-8936-05d1868c2f4e
23,discussion5," Wu et al. used βOHB to treat osteolysis induced by CoCrMo Alloy particles and found that βOHB could exert anti-inflammatory effects through the NLRP3 inflammasome and regulate the function of osteoclasts, thus relieving osteolysis [29]. It was concluded that KD inhibited the inflammatory response of OA through the NLRP3 inflammasome, thus protecting the articular cartilage.  The inflammasome is a protein complex found in the cytoplasm, and it is involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response. The NLRP3 inflammasome is the most widely studied NLR family member, it can be activated not only by pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, but also by various risk signals and metabolites in the body, including ATP, urate, and amyloid beta-protein [30]. Studies have shown that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in the inflammatory pathogenesis of OA and may represent a new therapeutic target [5, 31].",4a336c97-ca6d-4562-a5ce-4d8650bf3283
24,discussion6," The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in OA and promotes the maturation and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 [32]. Increasing studies have shown that inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in OA articular cartilage can reduce the inflammatory response and thus reduce articular cartilage injury [7–9]. Ni et al. showed that the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 can alleviate articular cartilage degradation in a mouse OA model [7]. Bai et al. demonstrated that intraarticular injection of baicalein inhibited cartilage catabolism through the NLRP3 inflammasome [8]. Similarly, our study showed that the NLRP3 inflammasome was highly expressed in OA of the knee joint of rats and that KD treatment significantly inhibited the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the articular cartilage of OA rats.",721ffd86-5208-4158-b4e9-1ef3bd81c3b2
25,discussion7," Similar to the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950, the ketone βOHB also inhibited ATP-induced NLRP3 activation, resulting in decreased inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and the cartilage matrix-degrading enzyme MMP13 expression in primary chondrocytes. Our findings highlight that KD protects OA articular cartilage by inhibiting inflammation through NLRP3.  Conclusions  Our results showed that KD treatment could reduce knee inflammation by inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby reducing articular cartilage and subchondral bone damage in OA rats.
