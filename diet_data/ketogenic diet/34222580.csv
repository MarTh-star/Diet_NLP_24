0,abstract0," STUDY QUESTION  What is the effect of the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB) on preimplantation mouse embryo development, metabolism, epigenetics and post-transfer viability?  SUMMARY ANSWER  In vitro βOHB exposure at ketogenic diet (KD)-relevant serum concentrations significantly impaired preimplantation mouse embryo development, induced aberrant glycolytic metabolism and reduced post-transfer fetal viability in a sex-specific manner.  WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY  A maternal KD in humans elevates gamete and offspring βOHB exposure during conception and gestation, and in rodents is associated with an increased time to pregnancy, and altered offspring organogenesis, post-natal growth and behaviour, suggesting a developmental programming effect. In vitro exposure to βOHB at supraphysiological concentrations (8–80 mM) perturbs preimplantation mouse embryo development.  STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION  A mouse model of embryo development and viability was utilized for this laboratory-based study.",b2530953-2c81-411a-b5a7-5484a1c4dfae

2,methods0," Mouse embryos were cultured in vitro with or without βOHB at concentrations representing serum levels during pregnancy (0.1 mM), standard diet consumption (0.25 mM), KD consumption (2 mM) and diabetic ketoacidosis (4 mM). The impact of βOHB exposure on embryo development (blastocyst formation rate, morphokinetics and blastocyst total, inner cell mass and trophectoderm (TE) cell number), physiology (redox state, βOHB metabolism, glycolytic metabolism), epigenetic state (histone 3 lysine 27 β-hydroxybutyrylation, H3K27bhb) and post-transfer viability (implantation rate, fetal and placental development) was assessed.  MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE  All βOHB concentrations tested slowed embryo development (P < 0.05), and βOHB at KD-relevant serum levels (2 mM) delayed morphokinetic development, beginning at syngamy (P < 0.05). Compared with unexposed controls, βOHB exposure reduced blastocyst total and TE cell number (≥0.25 mM; P < 0.",deef3d73-ea04-4db5-8082-bc5c7f72342f

Consumption of βOHB by embryos, mediated via monocarboxylate transporters, was detected throughout preimplantation development. Supraphysiological (20 mM; P < 0.001), but not physiological (0.25–4 mM) βOHB elevated H3K27bhb levels. Preimplantation βOHB exposure at serum KD levels (2 mM) reduced post-transfer viability. Implantation and fetal development rates of βOHB-treated embryos were 50% lower than controls (P < 0.05), and resultant fetuses had a shorter crown-rump length (P < 0.01) and placental diameter (P < 0.05). A strong sex-specific effect of βOHB was detected, whereby female fetuses from βOHB-treated embryos weighed less (P < 0.05), had a shorter crown-rump length (P < 0.05), and tended to have accelerated ear development (P < 0.08) compared with female control fetuses.",0ac9d855-fcf5-4cfd-a375-d888e75a46f8
4,methods2,"  LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION  This study only assessed embryo development, physiology and viability in a mouse model utilizing in vitro βOHB exposure; the impact of in vivo exposure was not assessed. The concentrations of βOHB utilized were modelled on blood/serum levels as the true oviduct and uterine concentrations are currently unknown.  WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS  These findings indicate that the development, physiology and viability of mouse embryos is detrimentally impacted by preimplantation exposure to βOHB within a physiological range. Maternal diets which increase βOHB levels, such as a KD, may affect preimplantation embryo development and may therefore impair subsequent viability and long-term health. Consequently, our initial observations warrant follow-up studies in larger human populations. Furthermore, analysis of βOHB concentrations within human and rodent oviduct and uterine fluid under different nutritional states is also required.",db6f2dab-329e-4975-bb96-a39af1a7caa0

Subsequent studies have revealed that a KD can be beneficial in treating Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease , type 2 diabetes , obesity (Murphy and Jenkins, 2019) and cancer (Seyfried et al., 2003; Morscher et al., 2015; Klement, 2017).",aa50ad8c-726c-4cbc-b629-ec9f69e570bd
6,methods4," More recently, interest has risen in using the KD to aid infertility, specifically, polycystic ovary syndrome (polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)); the leading cause of anovulatory infertility that is tightly associated with hormonal and metabolic dysregulation . Evidence suggesting a KD contributes to hormonal re-balancing (by reducing the LH/FSH ratio and free testosterone, and increasing progesterone) and insulin re-sensitization (Boden et al., 2005; Mavropoulos et al., 2005; Gupta et al., 2017; McGrice and Porter, 2017; Paoli et al., 2020), and consequently reverses amenorrhoea and anovulation, indicates that a KD may benefit the fertility of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Mavropoulos et al., 2005; Alwahab et al., 2018; Paoli et al., 2020). In addition, this diet is also gaining popularity amongst otherwise healthy women trying to conceive.",8fed1f7a-863a-4917-88a6-f48ac32188e4
7,methods5," The effect of a KD on human reproduction and offspring health is unknown, though limited mouse studies have indicated that KD consumption for 30 days prior to- and during gestation reduces female fertility by increasing the time to pregnancy while altering fetal neuroanatomy and postnatal/adult behaviour (Sussman et al., 2013a,b, 2015). These data infer that a KD could significantly alter the programming of gamete, embryo and/or fetal development.  A KD induces a physiological switch to fatty-acid rather than carbohydrate-based metabolism, which significantly elevates serum concentrations of the ketones β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), acetoacetate (AcAc) and acetone. Whereas acetone is primarily expelled via the lungs (Anderson, 2015), serum AcAc and βOHB are highly effective oxidative fuels for cells, with βOHB being the predominant ketone that is maintained at two to three times the concentration of AcAc.",a839c851-ac29-4aa5-85e0-aefecc15a096
8,methods6," Compared with a standard diet, a KD elevates serum βOHB concentrations by 10- to 18-fold from ∼0.12 mM to 2.09 mM in humans, and from ∼0.23 mM to 2.43 mM in rodents (Table I). Whether this leads to a corresponding elevation of βOHB within the oviduct and uterine fluids is yet to be determined. However, maternal diet is known to influence the nutrient composition of female reproductive tract fluid , and βOHB is a short-chain carboxylic acid with high vascular permeability that is readily transported across plasma membranes via monocarboxylate transporters (monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)s) (Halestrap, 1978; Laffel, 1999; Halestrap and Wilson, 2012; Halestrap, 2013). These transporters are present on embryonic cells and other reproductive tissues including the ovary, ciliated cells within the ampulla and isthmus regions of the oviduct, and the uterine surface epithelium and glands (Gardner and Leese, 1988; Harding et al., 1999; Jansen et al., 2008; Kuchiiwa et al.",6776bdc4-5dfe-4591-be6d-8c884dfdd170
9,methods7,", 2011). Indeed, ketones have been detected in human follicular fluid (Piñero‐Sagredo et al., 2010) and human amniotic fluid (Kim and Felig, 1972) at concentrations positively correlated with maternal serum ketone levels. Therefore, βOHB may accumulate within reproductive fluid, increasing its availability and consumption by the embryo, and have the potential to affect embryo development. However, the concentration of βOHB in oviduct and uterine fluids and its impact on embryo development requires confirmation.

10,methods9," While such plasticity enables short-term survival adaptation, the persistent nature of such changes can be harmful by predisposing offspring to long-term developmental programming and health issues. This phenomenon, emphasized by the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) (Barker and Osmond, 1986; Hales and Barker, 1992; Fleming et al., 2015), may be underpinned mechanistically by the interrelationship between metabolism and epigenetic state, termed ‘metaboloepigenetics’ (Donohoe and Bultman, 2012; Harvey et al., 2016; Harvey, 2019).  Post-compaction, the embryo relies heavily on glycolytic metabolism to support the production of biosynthetic precursors, cytosolic redox state, and to ensure lactate efflux for maternal-embryo signalling during implantation (Hewitson and Leese, 1993; Gardner, 1998; Harvey et al., 2002; Gardner, 2015; Gardner and Harvey, 2015; Ma et al., 2020; Gurner et al., 2022).",4eaa1e75-538c-4304-87f4-b8111a60f42a
11,methods10," However, βOHB promotes oxidative phosphorylation (Laffel, 1999) while suppressing glycolysis (Randle et al., 1964; Patel and Owen, 1977; Hunter and Sadler, 1987; Cox et al., 2016). This is of significance given that aberrant glucose uptake and glycolytic metabolism is a well-characterized biomarker of poor embryonic viability (Lane and Gardner, 1996; Gardner and Wale, 2013). βOHB also acts directly as an epigenetic modifier, via class I histone deacetylase (histone deacetylase (HDAC)) inhibition (Newman and Verdin, 2014) and up-regulation of histone lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) , and could feasibly impair the intricate chromatin programming that is characteristic of, and integral to, successful pre- and post-implantation development at a cost to long-term developmental and health outcomes.  Rodent studies have revealed a KD deleteriously affects female fertility by increasing time to pregnancy and reducing litter sizes (Sussman et al.",9993ccbc-c1a3-483b-b8b8-189bee0fe64f
12,methods11,", 2013a). A pre-conception and gestational KD induced mouse fetal organ growth alterations, including to the heart, pharynx, spinal cord and brain, which may lead to organ dysfunction (Sussman et al., 2013a,b, 2015). Notably, pups from KD consuming mothers that were standard fed postnatally exhibited growth retardation and neurofunctional and behavioural alterations including reduced susceptibility to anxiety and depression and increased hyperactivity (Sussman et al., 2013a, 2015; Wojciech et al., 2022). While these latter findings may be interpreted as a beneficial effect, they also infer a significant developmental programming effect of a gestational KD on offspring neurodevelopment and behaviour. Similarly, in vitro studies have demonstrated exposure to high levels of βOHB (8 to 80 mM) in culture medium retards preimplantation embryo development compared to untreated controls .",fa92d6d1-0489-45b8-8dc2-13843de861e1
13,methods12," However, the findings of these in vitro studies are limited due to their use of high βOHB concentrations and assessment of embryo morphology alone. More in-depth analysis of perturbations during preimplantation development, including mechanistic investigations into the physiology underpinning the developmental aberrations that may contribute to developmental programming, are therefore required.  This study aimed to determine whether exposure of preimplantation embryos to βOHB at physiologically relevant concentrations could program offspring development and health, by examining its impact on mouse embryo development, physiology, epigenetic state and post-transfer viability.   Animals and superovulation  Mice were housed under a 12 h light, 12 h dark photoperiod, with standard mouse chow (Barastoc GR2 Rat & Mouse Maintenance Cube, 13.5 MJ/kg energy from 3% fat, 20% protein, 75% carbohydrate) and water available ad libitum.",a0437270-efb6-452d-b676-88632867f234

18,methods17," Time-lapse images were captured every 15 min, and key developmental events recorded. Given that fertilization occurred in vivo and therefore its timing could not be accurately determined, morphokinetic events were measured as both hours post-hCG injection and hours post 2-pronuclei fading (tPNF). Developmental time-points analysed included t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, tM, tSB, tB, tEB and tHB, which respectively represented time to cleavage to 2-cell, 3-cell, 4-cell, 5-cell, 6-cell, 7-cell, 8-cell, morulae, start of blastocoel formation, blastocyst, expanded blastocyst and hatching blastocyst (Gardner and Truong, 2019).

19,methods18," Metabolic media were devoid of glucose, lactate or pyruvate and were supplemented with 0.5–8 mM βOHB, with or without the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)2 inhibitor, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC, 0.125 mM). The optimal concentration of CHC was determined by evaluating the effectiveness of 0.125–1 mM CHC on the inhibition of βOHB uptake by 8 mM βOHB-exposed Day 5 blastocysts (Supplementary Fig. S1).  Embryonic βOHB metabolism was assessed via ultramicrofluorescence (ultramicrofluorescence (UMF)), which utilizes enzymatic reactions coupled to the fluorescent pyridine nucleotide NADH (Leese and Barton, 1984; Gardner and Leese, 1990). The βOHB assay for ultramicrofluorescence (UMF) was specifically developed for this study and was a miniaturized and modified version of previously used protocols (Hansen and Freier, 1978; Li et al., 1980; Nuwayhid et al., 1988; Christopher et al.",dcf2e880-8a29-4e0b-ad57-94419b5d6162

31,results0," βOHB retarded preimplantation embryo development and reduced TE cell number  To determine whether βOHB exposure impacts the rates of preimplantation embryo development and yield, the proportion of embryos reaching or surpassing defined developmental stages was assessed in response to physiological concentrations of βOHB (Fig. 1A). All βOHB concentrations tested (0.1–4 mM) slowed embryonic development compared to unexposed controls. Supplementation with 0.25 mM (P < 0.01) and 4 mM βOHB (P < 0.05) significantly reduced the number of embryos reaching compaction by 70 h post-hCG (Fig. 1A). This developmental retardation was maintained for the remainder of the culture period, as 0.25 mM and 4 mM βOHB exposure yielded fewer early blastocysts (97 h, P < 0.01), blastocysts (97 h and 121 h, P < 0.05), expanded blastocysts (121 h, P < 0.05) and hatching blastocysts (4 mM only, 121 h, P < 0.05) compared to controls (Fig. 1A).",6a7cb4b5-aae3-4d1f-acd8-fa80a51dc8ab

The number of cells at the blastocyst stage and their allocation to the inner cell mass (ICM) or TE cell lineages was additionally assessed as this is an established in vitro indicator of blastocyst quality (Lane and Gardner, 1997). Total blastocyst cell number was significantly reduced by 0.25 mM (P < 0.05), 2 mM (P < 0.05) and 4 mM βOHB (P < 0.001) compared with unexposed control embryos (Fig. 1B). This decrease was attributable to a reduction in the TE cell number of blastocysts exposed to βOHB (0.",4bbf40c1-79ac-4893-b590-f5586e12f384

A reduced TE number in 0.1 mM βOHB treated embryos (P = 0.06) compared with controls was also observed but failed to reach statistical significance (Fig. 1B). The number of inner cell mass (ICM) cells was unaffected by βOHB treatment. βOHB therefore induced developmental delays when assessed at discrete timepoints, which was accompanied by impairments in TE, but not inner cell mass (ICM), lineage specification at the blastocyst stage.  Exposure to 2 mM βOHB slows preimplantation developmental kinetics  To precisely identify the onset of βOHB-induced developmental delays at a KD relevant concentration (2 mM), morphokinetic analyses were conducted using a time-lapse incubator (EmbryoScope). Analysis of morphokinetic timings as hours post-hCG revealed exposure to 2 mM βOHB significantly delayed the timing of syngamy (tPNf; P < 0.",d22b6d9e-34e1-4fa9-9b36-2f68bd062c9e

Furthermore, βOHB appeared to slow development to the 5-cell (t5) (P = 0.054) and 8-cell (t8) stages (P = 0.051), and delay initiation of blastocoel formation (tSB) (P = 0.072; Fig. 2A). Whereas βOHB-treated embryos underwent syngamy (tPNf) on average ∼25 min slower than control embryos, the average developmental delays induced by βOHB became greater as development progressed: βOHB-treated embryos lagged controls by ∼27, 33, 47, 38, 43, 52, 51, 70 and 83 min at the times of t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, tSB and tEB, respectively (Fig. 2A).

To reduce the possible impact of biological variations in mating and insemination times, the timings of key developmental events were additionally expressed as hours post-tPNf (Fig. 2B). When normalized to tPNf, no significant kinetic differences were observed between control and βOHB-treated embryos, however, a non-statistically significant tendency for delayed expansion was maintained (tEB; P = 0.06; Fig. 2B).",1ca0246e-692d-42c3-a26f-34b78d1190a0
37,results6," Furthermore, the trend for the kinetics of βOHB-treated embryos to become increasingly delayed compared with controls was maintained, whereby there was an average developmental lag of ∼0, 5, 19, 10, 15, 24, 23, 41 and 62 min at the times of t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, tSB and tEB, respectively, relative to controls (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the rate of blastocoel expansion (tEB-tSB) was not significantly different between control and βOHB-treated embryos (P = 0.131; Fig. 2C). Hence the cause of the delayed development in Fig. 2A can be primarily attributed to the significant delay in tPNf, which was significantly impaired in the presence of βOHB. This indicates that apart from syngamy, there were no other stage-specific developmental effects.

Altered blastocyst metabolism and aberrations specific to the TE cell lineage are possibly related to implantation and placental insufficiencies post-transfer, subsequently restricting fetal growth, with female offspring most severely impacted.  Preimplantation βOHB exposure impairs embryonic development and post-transfer viability  Preimplantation embryos exposed to physiological concentrations (≤4 mM) of βOHB in vitro experienced significantly delayed development compared with untreated controls, indicating poorer viability. Developmental delays were first identified at compaction when morphology was assessed at discrete timepoints, while the utilization of time-lapse microscopy revealed development was delayed as early as syngamy.

53,discussion2," (1994) previously reported exposures to ≥16 mM βOHB retarded mouse preimplantation development, however time-lapse microscopy was not utilized, and no effect on development was observed by supplementation with 8 mM βOHB. This discrepancy may be due to the earlier onset of βOHB exposure at syngamy in the present study compared with the late 2-cell stage in the study by Moley and colleagues . This suggests developmental events prior to embryonic genome activation, occurring at the 1- to 2-cell stage in mice (Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2018), may have increased susceptibility to βOHB that lead to significant and prolonged disruptions to physiology and developmental processes.  Developmental delays induced by βOHB culminated in blastocysts with significantly fewer cells, that notably was due to a specific reduction in TE cell number.",0d76bd6c-7766-46f2-98f1-0a400972e8cb
54,discussion3," Low total cell numbers have been correlated with reduced fetal developmental rates post-transfer (Lane and Gardner, 1997), thus further indicating that βOHB exposure may impair viability. However, the TE-specific reduction in cell number suggests implantation and placental development may be impaired, given the TE lineage forms the placenta. Indeed, this was supported by embryo transfer experiments in the present study whereby preimplantation βOHB exposure reduced implantation rates by 50%. Fetal development per implantation and the rate of fetal resorption was unaffected by βOHB exposure, indicating βOHB does not induce loss of pregnancy, but rather impairs the implantation process and/or placental formation. Indeed, fetuses developing from βOHB-exposed embryos had smaller placental diameter and restricted fetal growth compared with unexposed controls.",3afcee47-908a-446c-a8f7-f3de0766f2e0
55,discussion4," It is therefore plausible that, in addition to aberrant implantation, elevated ketone exposure may perturb placental formation and cause functional insufficiencies leading to the restriction of fetal nutrient provision. Fetal growth restriction can in turn predispose offspring to negative long-term health consequences, such as hypertension, kidney disease, and diabetes (reviewed by Doan et al. (2022)). Assessments of placentae from diabetic rodent pregnancies, during which time diabetic ketoacidosis and elevated ketone levels are common (Laffel, 1999), have identified placental structural abnormalities including impaired spongiotrophoblast cell differentiation and small labyrinth and junctional layers .

56,discussion5," Further, rodent studies have identified a maternal gestational KD to produce smaller offspring on embryonic Day 17.5 (Sussman et al., 2013b) and postnatal Day 2  compared to offspring from standard fed mothers. Together, these data suggest elevated gestational ketone levels may contribute to developmental and functional insufficiencies of the placenta that affects fetal growth. βOHB exposure at KD-relevant levels is therefore detrimental to the development and viability of embryos, with negative effects likely mediated through aberrant physiology and developmental programming of the TE cell lineage.  Mechanisms underpinning the viability-perturbing effects of βOHB  Exogenous nutrients impact embryonic metabolism and epigenetic state, and thereby act as signals to prepare offspring for post-partum nutrient availability.",ea7b2620-9b60-4782-bb16-6324346706e5
57,discussion6," Misalignment between gestational and post-partum nutritional levels contributes to metabolic disorders and pre-disposes offspring to long-term health aberrations, as described by DOHaD (Barker and Osmond, 1986; Hales and Barker, 1992; Fleming et al., 2015). To elucidate how and why βOHB negatively impacts mouse embryonic development and viability, it is therefore necessary to understand how βOHB is utilized by embryos, and how it affects physiological and epigenetic processes that may contribute to long-term developmental outcomes.  Significantly, the profile of βOHB consumption throughout preimplantation development, reported here for the first time, indicates βOHB is utilized oxidatively by embryos. Prior to compaction, embryos have a low capacity for glycolytic metabolism and primarily utilize pyruvate for oxidative phosphorylation.",c8178d45-6c41-441c-9514-f70d014795d7
58,discussion7," The identified βOHB uptake profile bears a striking resemblance to that of pyruvate consumption by preimplantation mouse embryos, with comparable consumption rates observed at the 2PN (∼1.3 pmol βOHB/embryo/h versus ∼0.76–1.3 pmol pyruvate/embryo/h), 2-cell (∼2.4 pmol βOHB/embryo/h versus ∼1.2–2 pmol pyruvate/embryo/h) and 8-cell to compacting/morula stages (∼2.1 pmol βOHB/embryo/h versus ∼1.3–2.3 pmol pyruvate/embryo/h) (Leese and Barton, 1984; Gardner and Leese, 1986). The strong resemblance between βOHB and pyruvate utilization is therefore significant, albeit indirect, evidence that βOHB is metabolized oxidatively by preimplantation embryos, however, future analyses of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) flux and oxygen consumption will be important to confirm this.  Throughout development, preimplantation embryos consume βOHB via monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1 and 2, confirmed by the addition of the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) inhibitor CHC.",2b6b985a-c1dd-466f-a15d-ff9e9b475368
59,discussion8," Both monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)2 have specifically been detected on the apical membrane of TE cells, whereas they are absent from the TE cell basal membrane and from inner cell mass (ICM) cells . Significantly, monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1/2-facilitated uptake of βOHB by blastocysts occurred primarily at KD-relevant concentrations (≥2 mM βOHB), whereas at standard diet levels (≤1 mM βOHB) βOHB consumption was minimal. The observed consumption of βOHB at low rates even in the presence of CHC can be attributed to uptake via passive diffusion because of the high plasma membrane permeability of βOHB. The uptake of βOHB by other monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) isoforms (such as monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)3 or monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)4) is improbable given the absence of their mRNA and protein in mouse embryos (monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)3) (Hérubel et al., 2002; Jansen et al.",727d171d-2715-401e-8356-0caf8edee85c
60,discussion9,", 2006) or extremely low affinity for βOHB (monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)4, KmβOHB = 130 mM) (Halestrap, 2013). Under normal physiological conditions of very low βOHB availability (<1 mM βOHB), preimplantation embryos would therefore have minimal rates of βOHB consumption facilitated by simple transmembrane diffusion. At physiologically relevant concentrations (≤4 mM βOHB), the TE cell lineage, but not the inner cell mass (ICM), is therefore able to consume and be affected by βOHB, supporting the TE-specific effects observed on embryo development and viability including reduced TE cell number and post-transfer implantation aberrations.  Chronic βOHB exposure perturbed the glycolytic metabolism of blastocysts, whereby lower glucose consumption and increased glycolytic flux was observed.",a9a924d3-72a8-4379-a729-4236a3fb95a4
61,discussion10," The significant decrease in glucose consumption was likely accompanied by reduced glucose-derived carbon flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)) and production of biosynthetic precursors (Gardner and Harvey, 2015), culminating in reduced TE cell number and function, potentially underpinning implantation failure. βOHB at supraphysiological exposures (32 mM) has previously been reported to reduce pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity and compromise ribose moiety synthesis in ex vivo Day 9 mouse conceptuses  likely reducing cell proliferation. In the human, the grade of the TE appears a strong indicator of blastocyst viability . The rate of glycolytic flux has previously been reported at ∼30–50% in mouse embryos developed in vivo (Gardner and Leese, 1990; Lane and Gardner, 1998) and in ‘good’ quality mouse blastocysts cultured in vitro in low oxygen (5% O2) conditions.",8534b281-1ae6-4e30-9aeb-3be1c04f81de
62,discussion11," ‘Poor’ quality mouse blastocysts exhibit a high glycolytic flux within the range of ∼59–78% (Wale and Gardner, 2012; Lee et al., 2015), which is associated with impaired post-transfer viability, ascribed to the premature utilization of endogenous glycogen (Lane and Gardner, 1996). Chronic βOHB exposure significantly increased glycolytic flux to ∼56–68%; a range comparable to ‘poor’ quality embryos (Wale and Gardner, 2012; Lee et al., 2015) that suggests βOHB-exposed embryos may lose their ability to regulate metabolism in a manner compatible with ongoing and/or healthy development.  Embryos in the present study exposed to physiologically relevant βOHB concentrations (≤4 mM) experienced no change in β-hydroxybutyrylation levels (H3K27bhb) compared to controls. This is despite previous reports that comparable βOHB concentrations (2–6 mM) can induce a dose–responsive increase in H3K9bhb in bovine fibroblasts and cumulus cells, detected via immunofluorescence .",f9a43acc-9c2b-4644-8d2f-f568aa8e206b
63,discussion12," Supraphysiological βOHB exposure (20 mM), however, did increase H3K27bhb levels in both the TE and inner cell mass (ICM) cell lineages, despite the inner cell mass (ICM) not possessing the necessary transporters for βOHB uptake . This reinforces that βOHB is partially consumed via simple diffusion and can target both cell lineages at supraphysiological concentrations. These findings demonstrate a capability for mouse blastocysts to regulate H3K27bhb levels in response to extreme βOHB exposure, however this starvation-responsive epigenetic modification  is unlikely to have contributed to the metabolic and morphological developmental adaptations observed here. Other potential epigenetic targets of βOHB, such as histone acetylation, could alternatively be impacted by βOHB exposure, however this remains to be examined.",85ee20a0-3ced-4346-8192-986e76abda71
64,discussion13,"  In addition to its role as a histone β-hydroxybutyrylation substrate, βOHB can increase histone acetylation via its function as an endogenous class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (Newman and Verdin, 2017). In cells with high rates of aerobic glycolysis, such as some cancers, βOHB that is not/cannot be metabolized oxidatively instead accumulates in the nucleus where its histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibiting activity down-regulates GLUT1 expression and promotes cell death and apoptosis pathways (Li et al., 2006; Donohoe et al., 2012; Rodrigues et al., 2017). This metabolism-dependent epigenetic function of βOHB has been described as the ‘βOHB paradox’ . Results from the present study provide indirect evidence of the existence of the ‘βOHB paradox’ in TE cells and indicate that reduced glucose consumption and TE cell number may be regulated on an epigenetic level.",9f78a84a-eeda-4a52-a163-5e4083eb9d9d
65,discussion14," Firstly, acute βOHB exposure did not alter the redox state, indicating changes in availability of the glycolytic enzyme co-factor, NAD+, was not a mechanism that contributed to down-regulation of glucose consumption. Secondly, chronic βOHB exposure was necessary to induce changes in glucose consumption and TE cell number. This suggests there may be a gradual accumulation of excess/unmetabolized βOHB within the nuclei of TE cells over time, that could epigenetically down-regulate GLUT1 expression and promote apoptotic pathways, as per the ‘βOHB paradox’. In addition to alternative epigenetic modifications, further analyses of gene expression and apoptosis are warranted.  Following embryo transfer to healthy, standard-fed recipient females, βOHB-exposed mouse embryos produced smaller fetuses than control embryos, suggesting a developmental programming effect.",e11c4163-2b13-4847-a6a7-cecc05f22365
66,discussion15," Notably, this effect appeared to be sex-specific, as βOHB-treated female fetuses weighed less and had more rapid ear development compared to female control fetuses, while similar developmental alterations were not observed amongst males. Past assessments of the impact of a gestational KD on fetal development have not accounted for fetal sex (Sussman et al., 2013b), however, post-natal behavioural analyses have identified female pups, but not males, from KD-fed mothers to have increased hyperactivity and faster reflexes (hindlimb placing) compared to females from standard-fed mothers . Female-specific physiology may contribute to these sex-specific developmental programming events.",73705e89-2bbb-4a3e-890a-bc8e350f5834
67,discussion16," Prior to X chromosome inactivation (X chromosome inactivation (XCI)), an epigenetic process initiated in the TE cell lineage during implantation, female embryos have two active X-chromosomes carrying, among others, the gene for the glycolytic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Higher G6PD expression renders female embryos more glycolytic than males  and may consequently increase their susceptibility to the negative epigenetic impacts of βOHB, as per the ‘βOHB paradox’ . X chromosome inactivation (XCI) regulates the expression of ∼600 X-linked genes and over ∼2900 autosomal genes in mouse and bovine embryos, respectively (Kobayashi et al., 2006; Bermejo-Alvarez et al., 2010; Gardner et al., 2010), and aberrations in this epigenetic process could therefore underpin the female-targeted developmental programming effects of βOHB.",7f57bdcb-779b-4e62-af13-b7945d682c06
68,discussion17," The consequences of peri-conceptional/gestational βOHB exposure for female reproductive potential in subsequent generations will be an important future consideration.  Here we have provided a comprehensive analysis of the impact of βOHB on preimplantation embryo development, physiology and viability, however, there are several limitations that should be considered when interpreting results. Firstly, the in vitro model utilized to assess the impact of βOHB on embryo development does not mimic the in vivo female reproductive tract and therefore does not consider other possible factors changed by KD consumption, such as glucose, protein and hormonal levels. Secondly, we assessed βOHB exposure specifically during preimplantation embryo development, and have not considered how prolonged exposure during gamete development, fertilization and post-implantation fetal development may further contribute to developmental and physiological parameters.",919840bf-4a60-44e5-afed-758ea4ca0c5c
69,discussion18," Finally, the concentrations of βOHB utilized in these experiments were modelled on human and rodent blood/serum levels because the oviduct and uterine concentrations are unknown and could possibly be an under- or over-estimation of true βOHB concentrations within reproductive fluid. To address some of these limitations, current experiments in our laboratory are underway to assess the impact of a maternal KD on in vivo blastocyst development.  Conclusion  This study reveals that preimplantation embryos are capable of consuming βOHB as an oxidative energy source; however, its utilization is detrimental for mouse preimplantation development and post-transfer viability. Exposure to KD-relevant βOHB concentrations in vitro significantly reduced TE cell number at the blastocyst stage, and further delayed morphokinetic development and increased glycolytic flux, indicative of poor viability.",8b03fcaa-b7ff-4635-af4a-32d67cdf8698
70,discussion19," Through TE-mediated metabolic mechanisms, βOHB may affect developmental programming of mouse embryos, reduce post-transfer implantation potential and restrict placental and fetal development, particularly in female offspring. Further investigation to elucidate if and how βOHB impacts gamete development, and fetal development in late-stage gestation and post-partum is required. The consumption of diets which increase βOHB levels, such as a KD, by females without underlying hormonal/metabolic aberrations may therefore affect preimplantation embryo development and viability and may not be appropriate for periconceptional consumption. Further research to confirm these observations in humans is warranted.
