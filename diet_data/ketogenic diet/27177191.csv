0,introduction0,"Continuous interplay between the circadian clock system and homeostatic mechanisms regulates core body temperature (Tb) within a narrow range in homeothermic animals including mammals, and maintains it independently of the environmental temperature. The circadian rhythm of Tb that increases during activity and declines during rest is governed by the master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)) of the anterior hypothalamus1, 2. Neurons located in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus are believed to contain the central thermostat for the homeostatic control of Tb. It receives and integrates information about peripheral (cutaneous and visceral) and local brain temperatures and provides appropriate command signals to peripheral thermoregulatory effectors that control heat dissipation and production3–5.  Adaptive thermogenesis is defined as heat production in response to environmental temperature or diet6.",179aa9f4-dd2f-4524-b42c-fc8e9237ba35
1,introduction1," Neurons in the preoptic area trigger thermogenesis during exposure to cold by activating descending signals through hypothalamic and medullary sites to drive repetitive contractions of skeletal muscle (shivering)4. However, continuous muscle shivering leads to exhaustion and muscle damage. Therefore, non-shivering thermogenesis is activated during chronic cold exposure to sustain heat production through descending output from the hypothalamus to the raphe pallidus nucleus that in turn innervates sympathetic preganglionic neurons3. Brown adipose tissue (Brown adipose tissue (BAT)) is extensively innervated by sympathetic fibers and thus is an important site of non-shivering thermogenesis in most mammals6. The important molecule involved in cold-induced thermogenesis in Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is UCP1, which is a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein that uncouples proton entry from ATP synthesis6.",6ab1f3cf-f9fa-4fba-a2a2-7ab2dd943b8c
2,introduction2," Feeding acutely increases metabolic rates in mammals, and thus diet is also a potent regulator of adaptive thermogenesis. On the contrary, when faced with a harsh climate with inadequate food, some mammals periodically turn down their internal thermostat and enter torpor (controlled decrease of the metabolic rate, Tb and physical activity). Torpor is considered a means of survival during periods of low food availability. When food becomes available, such animals can rewarm to return to a normal level of activity7. Although the metabolic rate during torpor is strikingly decreased, Tb is regulated above a species-specific minimum by a proportional increase in heat production that compensates for heat loss8. The circadian system controls torpor timing that allows some mammals to stay entrained with the light-dark cycle, which facilitates continued foraging9.",a2338614-06bf-4364-8bdb-98a67e3c88f2
3,introduction3," We previously reported that chronic feeding with a ketogenic diet (KD) comprising high fat with low carbohydrate and protein contents induces torpor and significantly decreases core Tb in mice10. We also found that KD induces a decrease in Tb particularly late in the dark (active) period, and increases Tb during the light-to-dark transition to a level like that of a normal diet in mice10. Several molecules such as PPARα and FGF21 might regulate time-dependent torpor11, although we found that both KD and fasting induce hypothermia in FGF21-deficient as well as in wild-type mice12. The underlying mechanism that regulates Tb under hypothermia induced by KD remains unknown, although Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been considered a major thermogenic organ against exposure to cold.  The circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is driven by transcription/translation-based autoregulatory feedback loops consisting of the periodic expression of clock genes2.",ffdb1d89-e230-4f2b-a746-fdd227b2f669
4,introduction4," Studies of clock genes in mammals have revealed that oscillatory mechanisms function in various peripheral tissues such as the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, adipose tissues and skeletal muscles, and that they are entrained to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) by systemic time cues including neural, humoral and other signals such as feeding and body temperature2. Hundreds of circadian clock-controlled genes that regulate a remarkable diversity of biological processes have been identified in peripheral tissues including skeletal muscle using DNA microarray technology13–16. The significance of clock and clock-controlled genes in the skeletal muscle has been demonstrated in animal models of molecular clock disruption. For example, muscle force is reduced, mitochondria are dysfunctional and myofilament architecture is disrupted in Clock mutant and Bmal1-deficient mice14, 17. Muscle-specific Bmal1 knockout (KO) mice have muscle fibrosis18 and impaired glucose uptake19.",0a8d56bd-b42b-4793-99a6-58534b64170d
5,introduction5," These facts suggest that the molecular clock can modify skeletal muscle physiology. Here, we focused on the physiological role of Slc25a25 among 478 circadian genes in muscle16. SLC25A25 is a Ca2+-sensitive ATP-Mg2+/Pi carrier in the inner membranes of mitochondria that might be associated with thermogenesis in mice20, 21. We assessed the circadian regulatory mechanisms of Slc25a25, and its putative role in muscle thermogenesis during torpor induced by a KD. ",de38ad58-189e-4b5a-a41c-641a908451d0

Ketogenic diet induces Slc25a25 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle, but not in brown and white adipose tissues A previous study has shown that SLC25A25 might contribute to a thermogenic pathway in mice with defective Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis, because Slc25a25 mRNA expression is induced during adaptation to cold stress in the skeletal muscle of Ucp1 KO mice21. On the other hand, normal Tb was maintained in global Slc25a25 KO mice after acute exposure to cold stress, suggesting that SLC25A25 is not essential for the regulation of Tb during exposure to cold21. We investigated the mRNA expression of Slc25a25 in sciatic denervated and sham-operated mice after seven days on a ketogenic diet (KD) that induces time-of-day-dependent hypothermia (torpor)10.",67599476-74b9-4e1a-807d-01039d6d63f1
17,results4," In addition to Slc25a25, we also measured the mRNA expression of other thermogenic genes such as those for Sarcolipin (Sln), Pgc1a, Ucp2, and Ucp3. Sarcolipin regulates sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA)) and it is involved in non-shivering muscular thermogenesis during cold stress22. The thermogenic molecule PGC1α functions as a transcriptional co-activator of PPARγ that modulates the expression of Ucp1 and thermogenesis in brown fat23. The KD upregulated mRNA expression of Slc25a25 and Ucp3 by 2.4-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively, in muscle from sham-operated mice compared with mice fed with a normal diet (ND) (Fig. 2a,g). However, the KD did not induce the mRNA expression of Slc25a25 isoforms such as Slc25a23 and Slc25a24 (Fig. 2b,c).

The present findings suggest that both the central clock and energy homeostasis regulate muscle Slc25a25 expression via neural pathways, and that SLC25A25 may be involved in muscle thermogenesis under hypothermia induced by KD in mammals.

30,discussion4," Day/night behavioral and physiological rhythms including feeding and body temperature might, at least in part, be involved in the circadian regulation of Slc25a25 expression in muscle.  Muscle mRNA levels of Slc25a25 robustly fluctuated in a circadian manner that peaked at the day-to-night transition and were positively regulated by CLOCK and BMAL1 in a systemic manner through a neural pathway. However, the mRNA levels of Slc25a25 remained almost constant throughout the day in the liver, and upregulated in Clk/Clk mice (Supplemental Fig. 6a). These findings suggest that Slc25a25 transcription is tissue-specifically regulated and that muscle SLC25A25 plays an important role during the active onset.  We exposed mice to time-restricted feeding (diet available for 8 h during either daytime or nighttime) for one week30 to determine whether the circadian feeding schedule is involved in the circadian regulation of muscle Slc25a25 expression.",6c50abac-62bc-4f0d-9581-0cac5d4597ed
31,discussion5," This feeding schedule did not affect the circadian phase of Slc25a25 mRNA expression, which peaked at ZT14 in skeletal muscle (Supplemental Fig. 7a). In contrast, the reversed feeding schedule obviously affected the temporal expression profile of Slc25a25 mRNA in both the liver and white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice (Supplemental Fig. 7b,c). The acrophase of mRNA expression in the liver and white adipose tissue (WAT) corresponded to the feeding phase. These results suggest that feeding-derived signals are important to enforce the rhythmicity of Slc25a25 expression in the liver and white adipose tissue (WAT), but not in skeletal muscle. Feeding schedules do not affect the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)31. Therefore, neural signals from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) clock might be involved in the circadian regulation of Slc25a25 expression in skeletal muscle.",54094f35-a528-4ba1-bc3a-912ffdfd2ab5
32,discussion6,"  We analyzed the effects of a Clock gene mutation on Slc25a25 expression induced by the KD (Supplemental Fig. 8). We found that the KD-induced Slc25a25 expression in Clk/Clk mice, although to a lesser extent than in WT mice. These findings suggest that the molecular clock is dispensable, but partly involved in the KD-induced Slc25a25 expression in muscle.  We did not identify an effect of KD feeding on Ucp1 expression in either muscle or Brown adipose tissue (BAT), although previous studies have demonstrated KD-induced Ucp1 expression in Brown adipose tissue (BAT)32, 33. We analyzed the effects of short-term (7 days) KD feeding, whereas Kennedy et al. and Srivastava et al. assessed the long-term effects (5 and 4 weeks, respectively)32, 33. The effects of KD on metabolic tissues might vary dependently on the experimental period.",7b8a678d-9746-4144-a84c-c1e4e9c32836
33,discussion7,"  The present study found that sciatic denervation significantly decreased nighttime Tb in mice fed with KD, but did not affect Tb in mice fed with a normal diet. Sciatic denervation did not affect starvation-induced endocrine systems since the KD similarly increased plasma FGF21 concentrations in both denervated and sham-operated mice (Supplemental Fig. 9). Importantly, expression levels of the thermogenic genes, Ucp1 and Pgc1a in Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) were insensitive to the KD, although Tb was extremely decreased. These observations suggest that muscle thermogenesis plays an important role in maintaining Tb under KD feeding. Muscle thermogenesis has been explained as burst contractions of skeletal muscle (shivering) in an immediate response to acute cold stress34, 35. However, shivering is not a long-term continuous thermogenic response but rather a transient thermogenic response to maintain the Tb for a few hours36.",91137c4a-4202-4d19-b181-2678bdcb871a
34,discussion8," The KD did not affect the mRNA expression of Sln in muscle, although Sln is thought to be involved in non-shivering muscular thermogenesis during cold stress22. Therefore, SLN does not seem to be a critical contributor to the maintenance of Tb under a KD. Denervation remarkably increased the levels of Sln mRNA expression in muscle. These findings suggest that neural signals negatively and positively regulate the expression of Sln and of Slc25a25, respectively, in muscle.  Circadian amplitude and mean Tb decreases in elderly persons37–39. Changes in Tb rhythms associated with aging are frequently associated with a reduction in nighttime sleep quality40 and cerebral blood flow39. Levels of Slc25a25 mRNA expression were significantly decreased in the skeletal muscle of aged, compared with adult mice (Fig. 6a), whereas the levels of Sln mRNA expression were significantly increased (Fig. 6b).",c60eaf2a-2bbc-41b2-be98-acc7c50f05e8
35,discussion9," Several studies have found denervation in aging muscles41, including a progressive reduction in the number of motoneurons in the spinal cord beginning around the age of 60 years42, a loss of motoneurons in the periphery43, 44, degeneration of neuromuscular junctions45 and loss of motor units46. Aging-induced denervation might cause the downregulation of Slc25a25 in elderly persons, subsequent to a lower Tb. Meanwhile, Sln mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in aged muscle of mice (Fig. 6b). We speculated that aging-induced denervation increases Sln mRNA expression, and that the thermogenic function of Sln seems independent of aging-induced hypothermia. We also examined the effect of chronic exercise on Slc25a25 expression in skeletal muscle, because exercise is considered an effective approach to improve denervation in elderly persons47. We found that four weeks of voluntary wheel running29 increased Slc25a25 mRNA expression in the skeletal muscles of mice (Fig. 6e).",07bd58e9-697e-427f-a230-5828597927bd
36,discussion10," Thus, elderly persons should maintain muscle thermogenic activity to retain Slc25a25 expression and prevent an age-related decrease in Tb. Regular exercise might be a useful approach to maintain muscle thermogenesis through induction of the Slc25a25 gene.  We could not evaluate the effects of aging on KD-induced Slc25a25 expression in mice because such experiments are very time-consuming. Further studies are needed to understand the relationships between aging and decreased Slc25a25 expression, including the effect of KD feeding and sciatic denervation.  The present findings suggest that chronic KD feeding induces expression of the circadian gene, Slc25a25, via a neural pathway in muscle. Moreover, muscle non-shivering thermogenesis seemed important for maintaining Tb under KD feeding, and Slc25a25 and Ucp3 might be involved in muscle thermogenesis (Fig. 7).",a889a396-ce45-4d15-aa69-3df06b94b759
37,discussion11," This is the first report to suggest that thermogenesis derived from skeletal muscle is involved in the maintenance of core Tb under metabolic hypothermia. Sciatic denervation affects the expression of many metabolic genes as we have previously shown16. We believe that several genes are associated with muscle thermogenesis under metabolic hypothermia such as ketogenic conditions. In fact, the expression profiles of Ucp3 and Slc25a25 in skeletal muscle in response to the KD and sciatic denervation were similar. Further studies are needed to uncover the molecular mechanism of muscle thermogenesis under metabolic hypothermia.Figure 7 Summary of present study. Mechanism of muscle thermogenesis starts with shivering as first defense against exposure to cold. Thereafter, Sln 22, 50 and Ucp1 51, 52 are respectively driven to elicit non-shivering thermogenesis in skeletal muscle and Brown adipose tissue (BAT).",ed56668f-b225-46cf-9296-54886b3d3d8b
38,discussion12," Exposure to cold also induces emergence of brown adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT) by increasing expression of Ucp1, Cidea, and Pgc1a genes52, 53. Meanwhile, the present study found induced circadian Slc25a25 gene expression in skeletal muscle, but not in Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice fed with ketogenic diet (KD), which induces torpor. Messenger RNA expression of thermogenesis-related genes such as Ucp1 was not affected by KD in Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT). Sciatic denervation abolished Slc25a25 expression and augmented KD-induced hypothermia. These results suggest that skeletal muscle is involved in thermogenesis during KD feeding, and that Slc25a25 and Ucp3 are candidates for muscle thermogenesis. Less Slc25a25 was expressed in skeletal muscle of aged, compared with adult mice, whereas Ucp1 expression was not altered by aging at thermoneutrality54. SLC25A25 might help to maintain Tb in aged mammals.    ",0e9369eb-f935-4fbf-8923-30fdb8bb2ce9
