0,abstract0," This prospective open-label feasibility study aimed to evaluate acceptability, tolerability and compliance with dietary intervention with K.Vita, a medical food containing a unique ratio of decanoic acid to octanoic acid, in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy. Adults and children aged 3–18 years with drug-resistant epilepsy took K.Vita daily whilst limiting high-refined sugar food and beverages. K.Vita was introduced incrementally with the aim of achieving ≤35% energy requirements for children or 240 ml for adults. Primary outcome measures were assessed by study completion, participant diary, acceptability questionnaire and K.Vita intake. Reduction in seizures or paroxysmal events was a secondary outcome. 23/35 (66%) children and 18/26 (69%) adults completed the study; completion rates were higher when K.Vita was introduced more gradually.",adc3f0a2-b224-4ef0-88d5-2f15ef688a8b
1,abstract1," Gastrointestinal disturbances were the primary reason for discontinuation, but symptoms were similar to those reported from ketogenic diets and incidence decreased over time. At least three-quarters of participants/caregivers reported favourably on sensory attributes of K.Vita, such as taste, texture and appearance, and ease of use. Adults achieved a median intake of 240 ml K.Vita, and children 120 ml (19% daily energy). Three children and one adult had ß-hydroxybutyrate >1 mmol/l. There was 50% (95% CI 39–61%) reduction in mean frequency of seizures/events. Reduction in seizures or paroxysmal events correlated significantly with blood concentrations of medium chain fatty acids (C10 and C8) but not ß-hydroxybutyrate. K.Vita was well accepted and tolerated. Side effects were mild and resolved with dietetic support. Individuals who completed the study complied with K.Vita and additional dietary modifications.",1b347bab-71a7-4bd5-a692-a035b3e27871
2,abstract2," Dietary intervention had a beneficial effect on frequency of seizures or paroxysmal events, despite absent or very low levels of ketosis. We suggest that K.Vita may be valuable to those with drug-resistant epilepsy, particularly those who cannot tolerate or do not have access to ketogenic diets, and may allow for more liberal dietary intake compared to ketogenic diets, with mechanisms of action perhaps unrelated to ketosis. Further studies of effectiveness of K.Vita are warranted.  See Auvin (https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcab234) for a scientific commentary on this article.  Schoeler et al. report that K.Vita, a decanoic acid-rich medical food, was well-tolerated when introduced gradually and flexibly to individuals with epilepsy.

Medium chain triglycerides (Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)s) enable decreased fat and increased protein and carbohydrate intake compared to long chain triglyceride-based KDs, although Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)s may be unacceptable due to their oily taste and distinctive mouth and throat feel.2 Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) products can be flavoured or incorporated into recipes to enhance palatability, but this may be inconvenient and time-consuming.",09f13e79-d94d-4a86-9805-fe21c64c6a9a
4,abstract4,"3,4  The canonical view of the mechanism of action of KDs is through ketone production,5 despite the lack of correlation of ketone levels with seizure reduction.6,7 This has driven increasing interest in the role of Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-derived fatty acids, in particular decanoic acid (C10).8 C10 is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and decreases excitatory neurotransmission and network excitability in vitro,9 increases seizure threshold in mice,10 and increases mitochondrial number plus respiratory chain and catalase activity.11,12 These effects may be potentiated by C8, which spares C10 from oxidation in neuronal-like cells.13  This potentially beneficial effect of C10 on energy metabolism and network excitability, in combination with improved palatability of Medium chain triglyceride (MCT), may offer a simplified approach to dietary management of epilepsy.

31,discussion1,"4 GI symptoms experienced in this study are commonly associated with Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)15 and were no different to those reported in individuals following KDs.16 GI symptoms from K.Vita decreased over time and were mitigated by phased introduction, which is not always the case for KDs. For example, 33–45% children following KDs suffer constipation during the first 3 months, and these high rates continue thereafter, irrespective of whether a classical or Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) KD is followed17; in our study, reported incidences of constipation declined by the end of 12 weeks. Other adverse effects were infrequent, mostly non-specific and likely unrelated to K.Vita. Attrition rates due to adverse effects in our study were low after greater flexibility was allowed with the time-scale for K.Vita introduction and quantity taken.",1247a9f6-7758-4c3c-9328-6a6f0db3ea7b
32,discussion2," At all stages, scheduled contact with the dietitian to provide support, advice and encouragement, helped reduce the incidence of GI side effects, and prevented early discontinuation. In randomized controlled studies of children and adults on KDs,18 diet discontinuation rates prior to 3 months are as high as 55%.  The majority of participants or caregivers in our study reported favourably on the sensory attributes of K.Vita and ease of use in conjunction with minimal dietary restriction. In contrast, reported grievances from individuals who have commenced a KD include issues with food preparation and restricted choices;19 approximately half of adults and 20% of children have discontinued dietary treatment, sometimes despite clinical effectiveness, owing to the intense effort required for food selection and preparation, social restrictions or refusal to comply with the diet.",e8e9a2ec-532a-431f-aeb9-b7d87e243d38
33,discussion3,"20,21 The restraints of conventional KDs may deter people from starting dietary treatment, with only 14–30% of successfully screened adult patients enrolling in dietary trials.20 This is reflected in our cohort who started K.Vita, of whom almost half who had previously been on a KD had discontinued it due to personal or social reasons, including non-compliance, and almost 20% were offered KD but chose not to start. Such issues are likely to be overcome with the use of K.Vita in this specific population.  Adults and children reduced their intake of high-sugar foods and beverages, in line with study dietary advice. Total carbohydrate intakes remained higher than those typically prescribed as part of an Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) KD.22 Percentage energy from protein decreased, although actual intakes compared to requirements were adequate for most participants and mean daily intake was maintained for children.",90043586-8f41-4c02-838d-26944a1ca242
34,discussion4," Reported energy intake increased for most participants, although this did not generally result in unwarranted increases in weight/body mass index (BMI). Participants’ energy requirements may have been lower than calculated due to immobility from neurological impairment and reduced activity levels associated with epilepsy.23,24 Assessment of dietary intakes by the dietitian, although highly trained and experienced in this technique, was reliant on self-reporting, which likely impacted the determination of accurate energy intakes at all time points.25 The need for dietetic input with this intervention should be highlighted, albeit substantially less compared to that needed for KDs.",0d9ca098-a521-4bc2-8820-f9ce943d316b
35,discussion5,"26  Although this uncontrolled study was not designed to determine clinical response, and the proportion of completed study diaries was low, the mean reduction of seizures/events observed in our cohort compares favourably to KD efficacy,18 particularly given the super-refractory nature of the population studied, and the fact that seizure documentation was only started as K.Vita was initiated (there was no pre-study baseline recorded). The correlation of seizure/event reduction with plasma concentrations of fatty acids also supports an effect of the diet. Efficacy was observed in a range of seizure types and epilepsy syndromes, similar to those that respond to KDs. Noteworthy improvement was observed in individuals with Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) and in the one patient with GLUT1-DS and associated gait difficulties, who had not had achieved such clinical improvement with previous KD treatment.",11b9ebb6-e494-485a-8fb3-2f4e1f652888
36,discussion6," These findings need to be evaluated further, with consideration of alternative methods of daily recording of seizures/events.  With the exception of isolated cases, participants were not in a state of continued ketosis, typically classified as BHB >1 mmol/l (although definitions range from as low as 0.2 or 0.5 mmol/l),27,28 and BHB levels detected were markedly lower than those seen in individuals following a KD. This reduces the risk of hyperketosis and eliminates the often onerous task of daily ketone testing. C8 and C10 plasma levels at visit C were in close agreement with levels observed in patients on the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) KD.29,30 Similar levels were seen in mouse brains following C10-enriched feeding10,31 and in in vitro studies with the optimum concentration for mitochondrial proliferation in neuronal-like and fibroblast cell cultures, approximately 250 μM.11,12  The suggested beneficial clinical effect of dietary intervention using K.",abbdd206-c62a-4b03-a69c-3d8ed2df6ec2
37,discussion7,"Vita with low levels or absence of ketosis, supports the putative role of C8 and C10 in enhancing brain-energy metabolism and subsequent reduction of seizure activity, probably independent of ketosis. In vitro studies have shown that C10, but not C8, increased cellular mitochondrial number in neuronal-like and fibroblast cell cultures, and enhanced mitochondrial respiratory chain activity.11,12 C10 alone exhibited antioxidant properties by elevating catalase activity, providing evidence of an additional role of C10 in neuroprotection against oxidative stress. Moreover, C10 but not C8 has been shown to decrease excitatory transmission and to reduce network excitability in vitro.9 In neurons, C10 is oxidized at about 20% of the rate of C8, and in the presence of C8, C10 oxidation is even further decreased,13 suggesting that C8 exerts a sparing effect on C10 catabolism, minimizing its degradation and contributing to the maintenance of brain levels.",615c9241-ee28-4921-b1d2-d4b6a18390e0
38,discussion8," This is supported by previous work showing beneficial clinical effects of combined octanoic and decanoic acid compared to decanoic acid alone.10 The positive correlation of C10 with seizure/event response in our study is consistent with these hypotheses but, due to the clear relationship between C8, C10 and BHB, we cannot rule out that other metabolites also play a role.  Consumption of K.Vita, alongside additional dietary changes, was generally well accepted, tolerated and complied with in our cohort, as long as a flexible approach was taken to introduction and target intake. This study was designed to determine tolerability of a nutritional product rather than primarily to determine effect on seizures or paroxysmal events. Nevertheless, in this group of complex, highly drug-resistant children and adults, we observed a significant reduction in frequency of seizures, or paroxysmal events for some participants, noting that the study was not blinded, nor placebo-controlled.",29dbd6e1-5539-46c7-a07e-4e3ac0db3e5d
39,discussion9," Our findings show promising development for liberalizing dietary management for epilepsy, and clinical resource savings. K.Vita addresses an unmet need for those who cannot access KD services. Further study is warranted; however, in particular, for individuals for whom observance of a KD may prove too challenging and outweigh any clinical benefits, and for specific disorders dependent on a KD, such as GLUT1-DS, and conditions with paroxysmal neurological events, such as Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC), with use of K.Vita alongside minimal dietary modification compared to a traditional KD, as in this study.
