0,abstract0," See Rogawski (doi:10.1093/awv369) for a scientific commentary on this article.   The medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet is an established treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy that increases plasma levels of decanoic acid and ketones. Recently, decanoic acid has been shown to provide seizure control in vivo, yet its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here we show that decanoic acid, but not the ketones β-hydroxybutryate or acetone, shows antiseizure activity in two acute ex vivo rat hippocampal slice models of epileptiform activity. To search for a mechanism of decanoic acid, we show it has a strong inhibitory effect on excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurotransmission in hippocampal slices. Using heterologous expression of excitatory ionotropic glutamate receptor AMPA subunits in Xenopus oocytes, we show that this effect is through direct AMPA receptor inhibition, a target shared by a recently introduced epilepsy treatment perampanel.",a38149e1-88fd-4870-bae4-50c14cba10dc
1,abstract1," Decanoic acid acts as a non-competitive antagonist at therapeutically relevant concentrations, in a voltage- and subunit-dependent manner, and this is sufficient to explain its antiseizure effects. This inhibitory effect is likely to be caused by binding to sites on the M3 helix of the AMPA-GluA2 transmembrane domain; independent from the binding site of perampanel. Together our results indicate that the direct inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission by decanoic acid in the brain contributes to the anti-convulsant effect of the medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet.

2,introduction0,"The medium chain triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) ketogenic diet was first identified as a treatment for refractory epilepsy in 1971 . It has provided one of the most effective therapeutic approaches for children with drug-resistant epilepsy (Liu, 2008; Neal and Cross, 2010; Levy et al., 2012) and has recently been demonstrated to be effective in childhood epilepsy in a randomized control trial . However, the diet has adverse gastro-intestinal related side effects, such as diarrhoea, vomiting, bloating, and cramps (Liu, 2008). Furthermore, it has also been shown that there is a high attrition rate for the diet, due to many patients finding the diet difficult to tolerate .",ab4189a1-ce0f-44e7-b3b1-104f4505fb2a
3,introduction1," An understanding of the mechanism of action of the diet will not only provide insight into mechanisms underlying epilepsy, but also facilitate the development of novel drugs and better targeted dietary therapies that are effective in drug-resistant epilepsy, yet lack many of the adverse effects of the conventional medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet.  Understanding the therapeutic mechanism of the diet has been challenging (Rho and Sankar, 2008; Rho and Stafstrom, 2011). It was initially assumed that ketone production was the key to the diet’s antiepileptic effect, but there is a poor correlation between serum ketones and seizure control . Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies of the anticonvulsant effects of ketones have proved inconclusive .",9f151ebb-3d32-4651-bd44-fc4655baaaa2
4,introduction2," In addition to ketones, the diet also causes an increase in plasma levels of the two fatty acids provided in medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, the straight chain, 10-carbon decanoic acid, and the eight-carbon octanoic acid (Haidukewych et al., 1982; Sills et al., 1986a). Recently, it has been established that decanoic acid has antiseizure effects at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro and in vivo  but octanoic acid does not, and with previous in vivo pharmacokinetic data indicating that decanoic acid penetrates the blood–brain barrier (Oldendorf, 1973), these data suggest that decanoic acid directly contributes to the therapeutic effect of the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet. Indeed, in vitro, decanoic acid is more potent than valproic acid [a branched chain fatty acid isomer of octanoic acid, that is commonly used in the treatment of epilepsy (Chang et al.",2b2a069b-d208-41c0-b513-12e9f52c5c2f
5,introduction3,", 2013), and which has been shown to act on phosphoinositide signalling in seizure control (Xu et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2012, 2014a)]. Thus, it is unclear if ketones or decanoic acid provide direct, acute antiseizure effects during administration of an medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet, and by what mechanism. These questions are addressed here. ",5b328a79-66b0-433e-81af-b5a38d359309

17,results0,"Decanoic acid, not ketones, acutely inhibits epileptiform activity We initially assessed whether the acute antiseizure effects of the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet are related to a direct effect of decanoic acid or ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate and acetone). Here we used two different in vitro models of epileptiform activity generated by decreasing GABAergic inhibition (pentylenetetrazol) (Fig. 1A–C) or potentiating NMDA receptor currents (low magnesium) (Fig. 1D–F). In both models, even at high concentrations (10 mM), ketone bodies did not have any effect on epileptiform activity. In contrast, at a concentration at which valproic acid, a branched chain fatty acid and long-established antiepileptic drug, only modifies seizure activity in these models (1 mM) (Chang et al., 2012, 2013), decanoic acid completely blocked epileptiform activity in both models (Fig. 1).",b5047a3f-35f7-42f4-b197-4fc9053292c0

27,results10,"  We have previously observed that chemical modification of medium chain fatty acids can increase their potency against multiple in vitro and in vivo seizure models (Chang et al., 2012, 2013, 2014a). For example, although octanoic acid shows little seizure control in these models, a branched derivative, 4-methyloctanoic acid is strongly active. We therefore examined the potency of 4-methyloctanoic acid for inhibitory activity at AMPA receptors (GluA2/3) (Fig. 5). This compound showed strong inhibitory activity [IC50 0.84 ± 0.04 mM (n = 14)], consistent with that shown for seizure control.

Competitive inhibition would be predicted to shift the dose-response curves to the right (increasing the EC50 but with the same maximal response). However, in contrast, we observed a significant reduction in mean EC50s for glutamate in the presence of decanoic acid compared to control [from 0.029 mM for control to 0.015 mM and 0.018 mM for 0.3 mM (P < 0.001) and 1.0 mM (P < 0.01) decanoic acid, respectively; Fig. 6D] and also a marked reduction in the maximal response at increasing decanoic acid concentrations. Such observations indicate that decanoic acid displays non-competitive inhibition at AMPA receptors. Furthermore, we also compared the mean IC50s of decanoic acid in the presence of low (100 μM) and high (1 mM) glutamate concentrations (Fig. 6E and F). Application of decanoic acid resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in the glutamate-induced (100 µM) AMPA receptor current with an IC50 value of 0.52 ± 0.",6fa3f525-54eb-4b94-a9ec-c34cd25eb578

Repeating these experiments at higher glutamate concentrations (1 mM) did not alter the inhibitory effect (0.54 ± 0.03 mM, n = 10; Fig. 6E and F), suggesting that decanoic acid inhibition is not reversed by higher glutamate concentrations and is acting as a non-competitive inhibitor of AMPA receptors. This indicates that decanoic acid is likely to bind to a different region of AMPA receptors from that to which glutamate binds, and that this inhibitory mechanism may be shared amongst a number of fatty acids with anti-seizure activity.  We then investigated the voltage-dependence of direct AMPA receptor inhibition by decanoic acid using GluA2/3. Here, we clamped the voltage across the oocyte membrane at different membrane potentials, and examined changes in inhibitory activity of decanoic acid on AMPA-dependent current that may occur during synaptic depolarization.",1590529a-2ab5-45c5-93e2-d16b059a4855
34,results17," In these experiments, decanoic acid shows enhanced AMPA inhibition at the more depolarized membrane potential, −40 mV, where the IC50 is 0.43 ± 0.09 mM (n = 6) in comparison to −80 mV, where the IC50 is 1.11 ± 0.05 mM (n = 6) (Fig. 6G and H).  Decanoic acid binds in the channel of AMPA receptors We next sought to identify a potential binding site for decanoic acid within the AMPA receptor using a modelling approach with the AMPA-sensitive, homotetrameric, rat GluA2 receptor (3KG2). In silico analysis was used to evaluate the binding of both decanoic acid and perampanel in the transmembrane domain of 3KG2 , where over 2.5 million confirmations of decanoic acid and 3KG2 were evaluated, and the 25 conformations producing the lowest binding energy were used to define specific binding locations within the receptor. From these, the frequency of individual amino acid residues participating in binding (i.e. within 6 Å of decanoic acid) were determined (Supplementary Fig.",7bd0c053-2fcc-4ebe-ba2c-3bdaa6841bcc
35,results18," 3). The most frequent residues involved in binding decanoic acid span residues 584–590 (Fig. 7A and B) (Supplementary Fig. 3). This coincides with the M3 helix of the transmembrane domain and, specifically, those residues found to influence the inward current through the receptor and thought to be involved in gating. We also examined the site for perampanel, a recently introduced treatment for partial onset seizures and showing efficacy in drug resistant epilepsy (Russo et al., 2012; Rektor, 2013). Our modelling approach predicted perampanel to bind to a region in the border between S1 and the channel, consistent with that identified in other reports (Szenasi et al., 2008; Rogawski, 2011). These data suggest that decanoic acid binds directly to the AMPA receptor channel, at a location separate from that of perampanel, and thus may exhibit a different physiological effect to perampanel.

36,results19," A molecular modelling approach was taken to investigate binding sites of decanoic acid on AMPA receptors using the active protein configuration (3KG2) of GluA2 and modelling residues within 6 Å of the ligand.

37,discussion0,"The predominant mechanism of ketogenic diets, as the name suggests, has been widely considered to be through the production of ketone bodies (Bough and Rho, 2007; Rho and Stafstrom, 2011), such as 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, since these are found to be elevated in the plasma of patients on the diet (Huttenlocher, 1976). However, a correlation between blood ketone levels and seizure control in patients and animal models has not been consistently found . Our study suggests that decanoic acid, rather than ketones, may provide the direct molecular mechanism of medium chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet, in two ex vivo models for drug-resistant epilepsy, although ketones are likely to provide other benefits (Bough and Rho, 2007; Rho and Sankar 2008; Rho and Stafstrom, 2011; Kim et al., 2015).",9cd42224-ca9b-40a1-88d9-6be9d29ff326
38,discussion1," This is further supported by other studies showing that ketone bodies do not directly alter excitatory or inhibitory hippocampal synaptic transmission  nor affect epileptiform activity (either interictal or ictal activity) induced by 4-aminopyridine in hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices , although ketones have been shown to modulate vesicular glutamate transporter activity at presynaptic sites . Nevertheless, there may be circumstances, when ketones do play a greater role such as in Glut1 deficiency, in which ketones from the ketogenic diet provide the brain with an alternative energy source (Veggiotti and De Giorgis, 2014). Moreover, the ketogenic diet in the longer term may modify metabolic and gene expression, which could have important disease-modifying effects .",fd58c3d1-2641-4a63-9cf4-9b82ee1a3ef6
39,discussion2," Also, the ketogenic diet (with reduced glucose) decreases cellular pyruvate/oxaloacetate concentrations, which has recently been shown to hyperpolarize neurons through an effect on neuronal potassium currents .  The classical (long chain triglyceride; LCT) ketogenic diet, which has been shown to be as effective as the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet , provides up to 90% of the calories in the diet as fat and is extremely restrictive. In contrast, the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet allows less energy to be provided as total fat (typically resulting in a total fat intake of 65–75% energy) allowing for a less restrictive and more varied diet. The implication of our results for the mechanism of action for the classical diet are yet to be explored; however, long chain fats are metabolized to shorter chain fats and it would thus be expected that serum medium chain fats will be increased.",494c8b98-b695-4a60-b37e-ae3cb0b4b53d
40,discussion3," Future studies to monitor brain medium fatty acid levels in animal models and in patient plasma during ketogenic diets will be necessary to determine the role of fatty acids in the control of seizures.  Decanoic acid is a major constituent of the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet, providing ∼40% of the medium chain fat within the diet (Sills et al., 1986a). Even though decanoic acid is extensively metabolized to carbon dioxide, ketone bodies, and long chain fatty acids, it has been reported that there are high concentrations of decanoic acid (averaging 156.7 µM) in the serum of children with intractable epilepsy treated with medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet for the control of drug-resistant seizures (Haidukewych et al., 1982; Sills et al., 1986a; Dean et al., 1989).",74a17bca-7671-49f6-9060-a9a7f4afef40
41,discussion4," A direct correlation between decanoic acid concentrations and seizure control has not, however, been shown, partly because the studies are too small to demonstrate such a correlation, but also because the ketogenic diet may have multiple other actions. Importantly, mice treated with decanoic acid by gastric gavage (30 mmol/kg; Wlaz et al., 2012) have increased brain decanoic acid concentrations (up to 240 µM), which represent 60–80% of serum levels. These results indicate that fatty acids are present in appreciable amounts in the peripheral blood and brain and therefore are ideally placed to have an effect on seizure control in the brain. Decanoic acid has also been shown to delay the onset of picrotoxin-induced clonic seizures and prolong the survival time in mice with pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions . In addition, there is a direct effect of the fatty acids contained in medium chain triglyceride (MCT) on cerebral excitability (Huttenlocher et al.",16fe62e5-1c6c-4f85-8deb-f0d7fb7dba4f
42,discussion5,", 1971; Sills et al., 1986a, b). As we also show that decanoic acid inhibits epileptiform activity in vitro, it is likely that decanoic acid is a significant therapeutic component of the diet.  We determined the acute effect of decanoic acid on synaptic transmission in the CA1 area of the rat hippocampus and identified that decanoic acid reduced EPSC amplitude, at a similar concentration to peak plasma concentrations in children undergoing the diet (300 µM; Haidukewych et al., 1982; Sills et al., 1986a; Dean et al., 1989) and in a manner consistent with a postsynaptic effect. Moreover, the same concentration of decanoic acid had no appreciable effect on inhibitory transmission. These data indicate that decanoic acid acts at AMPA receptors. These receptors provide a recognized target for seizure control, and mediate fast glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the CNS (Traynelis et al., 2010; Rogawski, 2011).",8a5453eb-6a42-4aa8-affe-3c5004c2a60b
43,discussion6," AMPA receptors play a key role in generating and propagating epileptic activity and, in the long-term, adaptive cellular plasticity associated with epileptogenesis (Rogawski and Donevan, 1999; Chapman, 2000). The receptors are present in all areas of the brain relevant to epilepsy, including the cerebral cortex, amygdala, thalamus and hippocampus (Beneyto and Meador-Woodruff, 2004; Rogawski, 2011). Furthermore, AMPA receptor antagonists have a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant activity in various in vitro and in vivo epilepsy models (Rogawski and Donevan, 1999; Rogawski, 2011). Here we show that the degree of AMPA receptor antagonism by decanoic acid is sufficient to explain its antiseizure effect. Similarly, perampanel, a recently approved treatment for refractory partial epilepsy, acts through AMPA receptor antagonism (Rektor, 2013).",251b8914-0d9c-4537-ac2e-5cf942fa90b8
44,discussion7," Thus, our results showing that decanoic acid reduces the magnitude of fast glutamatergic signalling in the hippocampus are consistent with previous reports that AMPA receptors are a recognized target for antiseizure therapies (Meldrum and Rogawski, 2007; Szenasi et al., 2008; Russo et al., 2012).  The results from ex vivo hippocampal slices do not, however, distinguish a direct from an indirect effect of decanoic acid on AMPA receptors. To overcome this, we used a heterologous expression model, where AMPA receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes to enable a detailed characterization of the effect of decanoic acid on AMPA receptor activity. Decanoic acid directly inhibited AMPA receptors comprised of GluA1 homodimers, and GluA1/2 and GluA2/3 heterodimers—the latter two represent the two most abundant AMPA receptor combinations in the adult brain .",d533a833-ec35-4c84-bbc3-1c3da2f210b0
45,discussion8," It is interesting to note that patients with chronic epilepsy show a significant increase of hippocampal dendritic GluA2/3 subunits in dentate granule cells (de Lanerolle et al., 1989), and our data would suggest a concomitant enhanced efficacy of decanoic acid in this population. GluA subunits show differential spatial and temporal changes in subunit expression throughout development , and the GluA2/3 subunits are expressed at increased levels during postnatal development (postnatal Days 10–15) in the rat hippocampus , and long-term expression changes following the development of epilepsy in animal models . These results indicate that decanoic acid exerts a direct effect on AMPA-mediated currents, at concentrations as low as 100 µM (providing ∼20% inhibition), suggesting a likely influence on neuronal function in patients on the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet.",454fbf65-94b5-488e-8630-c024f62e6aec
46,discussion9," However, the finding that decanoic acid likely has additional therapeutic targets due to its effect on phosphoinositides (Chang et al., 2012, 2014a, b), raises the question of whether this degree of AMPA receptor antagonism is sufficient to explain its therapeutic effects in humans. Perampanel, a selective AMPA receptor antagonist, at the free concentrations observed to be efficacious in humans, 30–50 nM (Rogawski and Hanada, 2013), results in ∼20% reduction in field EPSP slope . This effect is of a similar magnitude to the effect that we observed with therapeutically relevant concentrations of decanoic acid, indicating that the AMPA receptor antagonism may be sufficient to explain the antiseizure effects in humans (although we cannot exclude that its' effect on other targets could also play a part).",2a94b3e4-7de1-45b9-beb8-c2d3cf64518d
47,discussion10,"  We continued our investigation into AMPA receptor inhibition by further characterizing the mechanism of decanoic acid inhibition, in particular determining whether it competes with glutamate for binding to the AMPA receptor. This is relevant as during conditions in which there are large rises in glutamate concentrations (such as seizure activity), competitive inhibitors may be less effective. However, we clearly demonstrate that varying the glutamate concentration by an order of magnitude does not alter the IC50 of decanoic acid inhibition, indicating that decanoic acid is a non-competitive inhibitor at AMPA receptors. The potency of decanoic acid-dependent AMPA receptor inhibition is therefore independent of increased glutamate during seizure activity and will still occur at synaptic glutamate concentrations in the millimolar range .",19fc676d-cbb8-4c27-b84e-b3c984d18c23
48,discussion11," We also determined that AMPA receptor inhibition by decanoic acid is voltage-dependent, and is more effective at depolarized potentials. This voltage dependence suggests that the therapeutic effect of decanoic acid in reducing AMPA receptor currents is enhanced during post-synaptic activation and seizure propagation. This result also suggests that the binding site for decanoic acid lies in or near to the channel region of the receptor and is consistent with the properties of known AMPA receptor pore blockers such as the polyamines (Washburn and Dingledine, 1996).  Our modelling of the binding of decanoic acid to AMPA receptors also suggests a binding site in the channel region of the receptor. Our data indicate that decanoic acid binds by means of hydrogen bonding between its two carboxylic acid oxygens and the two hydrogens of the cyclic amine group of proline at residue position 584 on each of the four M3 helices subunits within the ion channel.",3425f578-03b5-41b7-9611-76cdb602a924
49,discussion12," It is likely that the binding of decanoic acid to each of the four subunits cooperatively contributes to its therapeutic effects. We believe that this mode of action will provide both steric effects restricting the physical dimensions of the ion channel pore coupled to electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged carboxylic group and cations flowing through the ion channel. Interactions between decanoic acid and cations passing through the channel would not only result in further narrowing the ion channel pore, but also create a positive electrostatic field which may serve to repel and prevent additional cations from passing through the blocked ion channel. However, the precise mechanistic aspects of decanoic acid function, including possible effect on receptor desensitization, remain unclear. The distinct localization of binding for decanoic acid and perampanel (Szenasi et al., 2008; Rogawski, 2011) suggests different inhibitory profiles and, possibly, clinical effects.",b1a20750-454c-4874-b15f-a0c171aa243f
50,discussion13," This may explain why certain adverse effects of perampanel, such as increased aggression (Rugg-Gunn, 2014; Steinhoff et al., 2014), are not so evident with the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet. Moreover, as perampanel and decanoic acid act at separate sites, it is possible that they have a cooperative effect at the AMPA receptor, suggesting that permapanel and the ketogenic diet could be synergistic.  Our results have far-reaching clinical implications. For Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Doose syndrome and Dravet’s syndrome antiepileptic drugs are often insufficient to obtain seizure control and non-pharmacological interventions are often required. Here the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet can be effective in seizure management (Kossoff and Rho, 2009; Vanstraten and Ng, 2012; Laux and Blackford, 2013), and enhanced dietary intake of decanoic acid may provide additional therapeutic benefit.",6b0c580a-bf18-4d55-bad4-1c9d06dadc6e
51,discussion14," Furthermore, treatment of adults with drug-resistant epilepsy, who show poor compliance to the stringent dietary regimen necessary for the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet, may better tolerate a normal diet with just added decanoic acid, e.g. in the form of a triglyceride.  There are a range of limitations to the discovery of an acute effect of decanoic acid on seizure control. First, it is likely that decanoic acid also has chronic effects, as has been shown recently on mitochondrial proliferation , and these effects may also have roles in decanoic acid’s therapeutic function. In addition, the role of metabolism on elevated blood levels of decanoic acid (Rho and Sankar, 2008; Rho and Stafstrom, 2011) remains unclear.",df0904b1-cbe7-43f7-a521-1fac9ad445df
52,discussion15," Is a reduction in carbohydrate load necessary for elevated blood decanoic acid levels? Recent studies have suggested that dietary medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, concomitant with a non-restricted carbohydrate diet, gave rise to ketosis (Courchesne-Loyer et al., 2013), although changes in specific medium chain fatty acids in the plasma were not determined. Future studies monitoring decanoic acid in the plasma of patients or healthy individuals on different composition medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oils, or with differing carbohydrate intakes, should provide indications of the dietary conditions necessary to elevate plasma decanoic acid levels to provide seizure protection through direct AMPA receptor inhibition.  The direct effect of decanoic acid on AMPA receptor mediated currents raises a concern of a detrimental effect on cognitive function.",a15cdc60-b4b7-4ca8-be73-f02555a56932
53,discussion16," Numerous studies have demonstrated that AMPA receptors contribute to synaptic strengthening during long-term potentiation, a cellular model of synaptic plasticity, and experience-dependent neuronal plasticity (Talos et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012). This is further supported by mouse models, lacking the gene encoding the GluA1 subunit (Gria1) exhibiting impaired hippocampus-dependent memory . However, neither competitive nor non-competitive antagonists of AMPA receptors (at concentrations that inhibit seizure activity) had an effect on long-term potentiation (a cellular correlate of learning and memory) , and this is consistent with in vivo data in which AMPA receptor antagonists at therapeutic doses do not affect cognition .",67a1a622-af10-4c48-9605-02933ba226e8
54,discussion17," Indeed, in humans, the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet has been shown to have diverse positive effects on brain function, such as increased alertness, better cognitive functioning, and improved behaviour, not only in epilepsy patients  but also in patients with type 1 diabetes given an insulin infusion . The extent to which these effects can be attributed to decanoic acid or other components of the diet remains to be determined.
