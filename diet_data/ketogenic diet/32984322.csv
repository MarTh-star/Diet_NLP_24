The patient characteristics are shown in Supplemental Table S1. The clinical outcomes of the acute MI patients were assessed by N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and left ventricular ejection fractions (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)s), which were measured by echocardiography 7 days after acute MI. Twenty-six patients without early reperfusion therapy were selected to analyze the relationship between β-OHB levels and cardiac function.

The isolation of adult mouse cardiomyocytes was performed as described previously [19]. After euthanasia, the heart was exposed. Following injection of 7 mL EDTA buffer into the right ventricle, the aorta was clamped with forceps, and the heart was removed. Multiple rounds of injections to the apex of the heart were performed with the following: 10 mL EDTA buffer, 3 mL perfusion buffer, and 30 mL collagenase buffer containing collagen II, collagen IV, and proteins. The heart was then pulled apart using forceps and filtered through a 100-μm strainer to remove large tissue debris.  After three rounds of gravity sedimentation, the adult cardiomyocytes were resuspended in culture media.",32caeddb-04a7-4226-826b-392dfefa8410
3,methods3," After enzymatic isolation, the cardiomyocytes were seeded onto laminin-coated coverslips (2 × 104 cardiomyocytes/coverslip) in plating media (M199 culture media [Thermo-Fisher Scientific], penicillin–streptomycin [Gibco], and 5% fetal bovine serum [Gibco]) and cultured at 37 °C for 2 h to facilitate attachment. Then, the cardiomyocytes were cultured in M199 culture media containing 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 mM Na-β-OHB (Sigma-Aldrich) (Na-β-OHB media). The cardiomyocytes were cultured in these media for 12 h before hypoxia was induced. The cardiomyocytes used in the roxadustat experiments were cultured in Na-β-OHB media before hypoxia as well as treatment with 50 μM roxadustat (Dalian Meilun Biotechnology). To simulate hypoxia, cardiomyocytes were placed in a hypoxia incubator maintained at 37 °C, 1% O2, and 5% CO2 for 12 h.

4,methods4,"  Animals and Surgical Procedures  Male C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) were randomly assigned to be fed a normal chow diet (CD; 11 kcal% fat, 20 kcal% protein, 69 kcal% carbohydrates) or a low-carbohydrate, low-protein ketogenic diet (KD; 93.5 kcal% fat, 4.7 kcal% protein, 1.8 kcal% carbohydrates; Dyets #HF93.5) for 4 weeks. After the 4 weeks, permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery (left anterior descending artery (LAD)) was performed to induce MI in the mice. MI surgery was performed as previously described by Erhe Gao et al. [20]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. A small hole was made at the 4th intercostal space, and with the clamp slightly open, the heart was “popped out” through the hole. MI was induced by placing a 6–0 silk suture slipknot around the left anterior descending coronary artery. After ligation, the heart was immediately placed back into the intra-thoracic space followed by manual evacuation of air and closure of muscle and the skin.",dddf020f-9df2-4b08-af07-b4e11267eb66

Mice with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)s between 30–45% were used for further experiments and were continued on their respective CD or KD. Echocardiographic analysis was repeated 4 weeks later.  All animal experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the animal welfare guidelines and utilized the ARRIVE guidelines [21]. All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University.  Statistics  All experiments were repeated at least three times. The Student’s t-test was used to analyze parametric variables between two groups, and one-way analysis of variance (and one way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) with a post-hoc test was used to compare parametric variables among three or more groups.",7085c572-5e0a-43ed-b01e-324143768e62

Cardiomyocytes were cultured with media containing different doses of β-OHB. Under normoxic conditions, treatment with 1 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM, or 50 mM β-OHB did not affect the viability of cells. However, after 12 h of hypoxia, β-OHB decreased the viability of cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a, b). Cell survival was determined using the CCK-8 assay, and results similar to those of the live/dead cell assay were observed (Fig. 2c).",1959dcdd-3ee1-409e-adf3-a5a299ebc880

Altogether, these results demonstrated that β-OHB inhibited cellular glucose uptake and glycolysis under hypoxic conditions. Meanwhile, we observed fatty acid oxidation post β-OHB stimulation in hypoxic cardiomyocytes, and the results showed that expression of CPT1B, the rate-controlling enzyme of the long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway, was not affected by β-OHB in hypoxic cardiomyocytes.

Metabolic characteristics can influence the function and fate of cardiomyocytes [24]. Under hypoxic conditions, cardiomyocytes have been shown to utilize anaerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation to meet their energy demands and to reduce damage [25].

31,discussion2," Then β-OHB induced more cardiomyocyte death by decreasing hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α and the downstream GLUT1 and the expression of key glycolytic genes under hypoxic conditions  Under physiological conditions, ketone bodies are mainly synthesized in the liver and then transported to the whole body for oxidative utilization in the brain, heart, muscle, and other organs [26]. The heart is one of the main ketone body using organs and has weak ketone body synthesis ability [27]. Myocardial infarction is a stress event which may promote ketone bodies synthesis in the liver through neuroendocrine regulation. In our study, the elevated plasma concentration of β-OHB in MI case may mainly come from the liver, but we cannot rule out the possibility that ketone body synthesis is activated in the cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions.",f6e22234-a021-4b31-8283-17dd9e69d9b6
32,discussion3," Song JP’s study showed that elevated β-OHB concentrations have been found to be significantly higher in the hearts of patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy than in non-diseased donor hearts [27]. Furthermore, increased concentrations of serum ketone bodies, but decreased concentrations of myocardial ketone bodies, have been detected in patients with dilated myocardial disease [28]. In our study, we demonstrated that β-OHB levels were increased in both the serum of acute MI patients as well as the cardiomyocytes of mice after MI surgery; however, β-OHB metabolism was not increased in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions. This observation is obscure because it is contradictory to the alterative ketone utilization observed in advanced-stage heart failure. Previous research has shown that hypertrophied and failing hearts undergo regulatory gene reprogramming to increase the uptake and oxidation of ketone bodies [23, 29].",56cd3af9-fb1a-47e1-8558-a0f009e97c5a
33,discussion4," Specifically, the expression of BDH1 was induced in the hypertrophied and failing mouse heart [22]. However, we found that cardiomyocytes exhibited decreased expression levels of BDH1 in response to hypoxia with β-OHB-treated environment. Studies showed that ketone body metabolism was enhanced and could be a fuel substrate for failing heart. Our study found that under the status of high ketone bodies, hypoxia treatment could not enhance ketone metabolism. The ketone metabolism decreased in hypoxia with high β-OHB environment, suggesting a mismatch between ketone body availability and utilization. In a previous study, it was shown that protein O-GlcNAcylation suppressed BDH1 expression, leading to reduced rates of myocardial β-OHB oxidation [30]. SLC16A1 is proton-dependent transporter and is well characterized due to its critical role in the transport of lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies across the plasma membrane.",27b6cdc4-2913-44c5-8089-9c4d1ac92634
34,discussion5," Previous study showed that protein expression of SLC16A1 was not upregulated, while mRNA expression of SLC16A1was significantly decreased post hypoxia because of the lack of corresponding HREs in their promoters [31]. This was consistent with our finding in that in the cardiomyocytes, the expression of SLC16A1 was lower in hypoxia control group compared to normoxia control group. However, the detailed mechanisms of this downregulation are not known. Furthermore, in our study, β-OHB downregulated the protein level of SLC16A1. The expression of SLC16A1 in β-OHB-treated hypoxic cardiomyocytes was decreased more obviously than in the β-OHB-treated normoxic cells. However, Laeger T’s study showed that under conditions of 5.5 mM glucose, 6 mM β-OHB did not alter SLC16A1expression in the hypothalamic GT1-7 neuron cells [32]. Different cell types and β-OHB concentrations may be responsible for the different results.",3bfaa239-0f81-48c5-9383-f3a1878b96b8
35,discussion6," Our data indicate that β-OHB metabolism was obscured and β-OHB was accumulated in the β-OHB-treated cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions, so β-OHB itself may participate to modulate the effect in hypoxia.  It is known that enhanced myocardial cell glucose metabolism increases cardiac tolerance to ischemic injury [33]. In this study, glycolysis increased in cardiomyocytes in response to hypoxia; however, elevated levels of β-OHB decreased glycolysis. Therefore, alterations in this metabolic mode due to elevated β-OHB levels may contribute to the decreased adaptability of cardiomyocytes in response to hypoxia. These observations support the hypothesis that ketone body metabolism can regulate the energy source selection of cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions.",7031e7e6-c872-46ee-b3d3-39a52a144361
36,discussion7,"  It is known that hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α regulates the expression of key glycolytic genes, including glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (glucose 6 phosphate isomerase (GPI)), and PFK1[34]. Our data showed that β-OHB decreased the expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions and also downregulated the expression of the glycolysis-associated proteins, GLUT1, PKM1, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)A. Furthermore, the expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α decreased after β-OHB treatment, and this effect was partially reversed by roxadustat. Therefore, our data collectively indicate that normal glycolysis in cardiomyocytes may be partially regulated by β-OHB via its regulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α under hypoxic conditions.",1010cd0d-4704-4d3f-ae6c-d180f8c6c586
37,discussion8," Because hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α is essential for cellular and systemic responses to low oxygen availability, reduced hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α levels may therefore be responsible for the increased death of cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions [35]. However, administration of β-OHB resulted in a controversial regulation of the expression of glycolytic enzymes in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Our results showed that there was no obvious nuclear translocation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α in 10 mM β-OHB-treated cardiomyocytes under normoxia (Supplementary Figure S3). So, we concluded that under normoxic conditions, the function of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α was weak, and regulated GLUT1 expression by β-OHB may be not mainly mediated by hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α in normoxia condition.",ce441d23-1d11-4af7-819b-e40159dbee2b
38,discussion9," For β-OHB appear to increase histone acetylation directly through HDAC inhibition [36], our previous study showed that inhibition of HDAC4 can lead to upregulating GLUT1 expression in cardiomyocytes [37], Miyai M’s study showed that increased histone acetylation in cells activated GLUT1 expression [38]. Under normoxia, whether the increased expression of GLUT1 in β-OHB-treated cardiomyocytes is acetylation dependent needs to be further studied. Under hypoxic conditions, cardiomyocytes exhibited high levels of GLUT1 surface expression at the plasma membrane, whereas GLUT1 protein expression was slightly increased under normoxic condition in 10 mM β-OHB-treated cells, and immunofluorescence revealed more GLUT1 perinuclear staining. We suspect that the enriched staining of GLUT1 was largely located in the GLUT-containing vesicles or perinucleus rough endoplasmic reticulum.",bd4bf478-e781-429d-b9af-69bc1d192cfb
39,discussion10," The subcellular trafficking of GLUT1 between internal vesicular compartments and the cell surface is a major form of GLUT1 regulation [39].  hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 plays a dominant role during cellular adaptation in response to changes in oxygen availability. hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 comprises two subunits: the hypoxia-regulated α subunit, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α, and the oxygen-insensitive β subunit, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1β [40]. Under normoxic conditions, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α is rapidly degraded via the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL)-mediated ubiquitin–proteasome pathway [41–43]. In our study, β-OHB decreased the protein level of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α in the cardiomyocytes after hypoxia, but the mRNA levels remained unchanged, and stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) by roxadustat through inhibiting the prolyl hydroxylases can partially reverse the effects of β-OHB.",b6513cd7-aca2-4af9-9e82-fe121140f1cb
40,discussion11," However, the mechanisms of β-OHB on hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α signaling might be multiple, and a large part of mechanisms still remains elusive. β-OHB itself can inhibit class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) [36], a family of proteins that play important roles in regulating hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α stability by deacetylating lysine residues [44], and our primary results showed that in cardiomyocytes treated with β-OHB acetylated histone H3 lysine 9 in a dose-dependent manner (Supplement Figure S2a). Furthermore, it is known that ARD1 (arrest defective 1) can mediate acetylation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α and negatively regulate hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α stability by accelerating hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α interaction with pVHL under normoxic conditions [45], and our primary results showed that β-OHB can modulate the expression of ARD1 and VHL (Supplementary Figure S2b–c).",5ccbb238-6f91-4a2c-9df2-a1baa765c743
41,discussion12," Next, the metabolism of β-OHB may affect the content of acetyl-CoA, succinate, α-ketoglutaric acid, and pyruvate, which all can modulate the stability of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α [46–49]. It therefore remains largely unknown which factor will be the principal determinant under hypoxic conditions in cardiomyocytes treated with high β-OHB. Future studies are warranted to clarify related issue.  In the current study, we revealed that the β-OHB/hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α/glycolysis pathway was associated with cardiac injury under hypoxic conditions. However, several questions remain. First, roxadustat only partially reversed the decreased expression of GLUT1 in response to β-OHB treatment under hypoxic conditions, suggesting that it did not completely reverse the effects of the β-OHB-mediated hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α protein degradation. Further studies are required to reveal if β-OHB independently regulates hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α stability.",24675d21-db88-41a1-ac78-b37edfb7a552
42,discussion13," Second, in contrast to what we observed under hypoxic conditions, we observed increased levels of the glycolytic metabolites, PFKFB3, HK2, and PKM1, in β-OHB-treated cardiomyocytes under normoxic conditions. Nonetheless, our goal of this study was to confirm the contribution of the β-OHB/hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α/glycolysis pathway to hypoxic injury. Therefore, we did not investigate the mechanism of these β-OHB-mediated effects under normoxic conditions. Third, besides glycolysis, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α has many downstream effects. Further studies are required to reveal the regulatory effects of β-OHB on myocardial injury in response to hypoxia. Last, we validated that β-OHB metabolism inhibited hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α-dependent glycolysis in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions. However, the mechanism of this β-OHB-mediated regulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α remains unclear and warrants further investigation.",90d701cc-eb17-4a51-9601-042adc934987
43,discussion14,"  In conclusion, our results demonstrated that increased β-OHB levels may be maladaptive to cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions. Therefore, patients with high levels of β-OHB may experience extensive injury due to ischemic heart disease, and a KD should not be recommended for individuals who have an increased risk of MI.
