FIGURE 1 Flow schematic depiction of study design.  Chronic sleep-deprivation protocol  The model of chronic sleep deprivation was induced as we described previously (Wang X. et al., 2022). Briefly, an Automated Sleep Deprivation System (Shanghai XinRuan Information Technology CO., Ltd. Shanghai, China) was used for the chronic SD in mice. The system stops mice from sleeping by randomly rotating bars. Five mice from the same group were placed in the system and got food and water ad libitum. Mice were acclimated to the SD system for 7 days to minimize stress before starting the study as previously described . SD was achieved with rotation (5 rev/min) from 14:00 to 10:00 + 1 day for 20 h.

Morris water maze test  The Morris water maze test was executed in a circular dark pool (height 50 cm, diameter 180 cm) filled with white water (25 ± 1°C). Mice were required to find a hidden platform which was placed about 1 cm under water surface in the center of one quadrant of the pool. The mice from each group experienced four consecutive daily training trials. A probe trial was then repeated in the absence of the platform. Behaviors of the mice were tracked using Any-maze software (Stoelting Co.), the escape latency during the training period, the time in the target quadrant, and the across numbers of the target area during the probe trial were analyzed.

10,results2,"  Effects of ketogenic diet on amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation in the chronic sleep deprivation exposed mice  Amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles are two typical pathological features of AD. Therefore, we first assessed the effect of KD on them to investigate the preventive effect of KD on SD-induced AD. As shown in Figure 3A, sleep deprivation for 21 days obviously induced the increase in the protein expression of BACE1, Aβ (Figures 3C,D, P < 0.05), and amyloid deposits (ThS Staining) (Figure 3F). No changes were noticeable in the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Figures 3A,B). Meanwhile, SD elevated the levels of p-tau and the ratio of p-tau/tau in the hippocampus (Figures 3A,E, P < 0.05). Nevertheless, their levels were suppressed by KD supplementation.

12,results4," The expression of neurotrophic factors brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and new neuron marker doublecortin (DCX) was evaluated by western blot (Figures 4B–D). We found that both doublecortin (DCX) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were declined in the SD group as compared with to Con group, which can be reversed by KD treatment (Figures 4B–D, p < 0.05).

Effects of ketogenic diet on hippocampal iron dyshomeostasis in the chronic sleep deprivation exposed mice  Iron accumulation is one of the main characters of ferroptosis. To evaluate the effect of KD on SD-induced iron dyshomeostasis in the hippocampus, total iron, iron accumulation and the expression of iron transport proteins were measured in the present study. We found that obvious iron deposition (Figure 5A) and increased total iron content (Figure 5B, P < 0.05) were presented in the SD group compared to the Con group. Meanwhile, significantly increased IRP1 (Figures 5C,D, P < 0.05), TfR1 (Figure 5F, P < 0.01) and DMT1 (Figure 5G, P < 0.05) accompanied with decreased FTH1 and FPN1 were shown in the SD group (Figures 5H,I, P < 0.05).

15,results7,"  Effects of ketogenic diet on lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus induced by chronic sleep deprivation  Lipid peroxides accumulation is another characteristic of ferroptosis. Therefore, we next to investigate the effect of KD on the lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus, we determined the levels of glutathione (GSH), GPX4, xCT, FSP1, and Malondialdehyde (MDA). In the SD group, an elevation in Malondialdehyde (MDA) was noted as compared to the Con group (Figure 6A, P < 0.05). On the contrary, as for antioxidant enzymes, significant decrease in glutathione (GSH), GPX4, xCT, and FSP1 were presented (Figures 6B–F, p < 0.05). However, all above alterations can be reversed by KD intervention.

Effects of ketogenic diet on hippocampal Sirt1/Nrf2 signaling pathway in chronic sleep deprivation exposed mice  To evaluate the molecular mechanism by which KD exerted preventive effects on SD-induced AD, we examined the expression of Sirt1 and Nrf2 in the hippocampus by western blot (Figure 7A). Compared with the Con group, a down-regulation of Sirt1 (Figure 7B, P < 0.05), and p-Nrf2/Nrf2 (Figure 7C, P < 0.01) was exhibited in the SD groups. While KD treatment counteracted this SD-induced reduction.

18,discussion0," Our present study demonstrated that, following a 21-day sleep restriction, the wild-type 12-month-old C57BL/6 female mice developed AD accompanied by cognitive deficiency, Aβ deposition and tau hyper-phosphorylation in the hippocampus, but these phenomenons can be reversed when treated with KD, indicating the prophylactic effect of KD on SD induced AD. Further mechanism revealed that this protective effect of KD is related with the inhibition of ferroptosis and the promotion of neuron repair via Sirt1/Nrf2 pathway in SD mice. In our knowledge, this is the first report on the prevention of SD-induced AD just by adjusting the diet to a mild KD.  Growing evidence has demonstrated that SD induces cognitive impairment which also is the clinical characteristic of AD (Zhao et al., 2017; Wang X. et al., 2021).",2ffdf61b-3f21-4ae2-a660-26c38a61da02
19,discussion1," The parameters of the MWM test showed that the escape latency was markedly increased, whereas the numbers of platform crossing and the times spent in the target phase in probe trials were obviously reduced in SD group mice. While KD improved chronic SD-induced cognitive deficiency, which is consistent with our previous study that KD prevented the cognitive deficiency induced by 21 days SD in younger mice (7-week-old) (Wang X. et al., 2022).  It has been reported that the sleep-wake cycle regulates the levels of Aβ . Aβ increases significantly following acute sleep deprivation and decreases following sleep recovery (Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018). Studies in AD transgenic mice have demonstrated that Aβ plaque in the hippocampus after a chronic sleep restriction . What’s more, chronic SD promotes tau pathology spreading, which is also associated with the overproduction of Aβ .",c44863d8-5beb-42b4-b052-a6cae61a472c
20,discussion2," BACE1 is the major β-secretase and mediates the production of Aβ (Zhang and Song, 2013). In this work, the 21-day SD induced more Aβ deposition via up-regulating BACE1 and Aβ production, accompanied with increased p-tau in the hippocampus in the 12-month-old wild-type C57 BL/6 mice. The results were supported by the previous study demonstrating that Aβ plaque generated via up-regulating BACE1 in 9-month-old, adult and wild-type C57BL/6 mice after 60 days SD . This phenomenon was reversed by KD treatment. In addition, it has been reported that sleep disturbances can impair Aβ clearance (Spinedi and Cardinali, 2019; Versele et al., 2020) found that ketone bodies (such as BHB) could promote Aβ clearance in a human in vitro blood-brain barrier model.",22cbc9ee-7279-4fa4-8e33-b920c365fd3b
21,discussion3," Consideration of the elevated blood BHB in the present study (Supplementary Figure 1), it is reasonable to speculate that KD-induced the reduction of Aβ deposition and p-tau can be partially attributed to the promotion of Aβ clearance. These findings reinforced the causal link between SD and late-onset sporadic AD and proved a prophylactic intervention of moderate KD.  Growing evidence demonstrates that hippocampal damage is the main factor of SD-induced cognitive dysfunction (Zuo et al., 2020; Wang X. et al., 2021). Our present results showed that hippocampal neurons are characterized by pyknotic nuclei and vacuolated cytoplasm in SD group mice (Figure 4A). However, KD treatment alleviated this degeneration in SD-exposed mice. The effects were supported by our previous study showing that KD can attenuate chronic SD-induced hippocampal damage in young mice (7-weeks old) (Wang X. et al., 2022).",4bc45b9f-a38a-419a-9794-acaee81201ca
22,discussion4," doublecortin (DCX) is a typical marker for adult neurogenesis and is close to cognitive abilities. The doublecortin (DCX) diminished with aging, but is lower in AD patients than their peers (Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019). brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the most important neurotrophin involved in the growth, maintenance and survival of neurons, and a lower level of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is related to a poorer cognition . Studies have shown that brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can induce doublecortin (DCX) expression, and promote neurogenesis and reparation of neurons . We found that 21-day SD induced a reduction in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, as well as in doublecortin (DCX) from the evidence of western blot and immunohistochemistry, which is in agreement with a previous study (Looti Bashiyan et al., 2021).",1615d723-63cc-40ab-a84d-5b55c6ef7429
23,discussion5," These above indicate that SD suppressed neuronal repair and then enhanced hippocampal damage and cognitive deficiency. Notably, we found that KD upregulated the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and doublecortin (DCX), which suggested that the protective effect of KD on SD-induced hippocampal damage can be partly attributed to the promotion of repair in SD-exposed mice.  Emerging evidence indicated that SD-induced cognitive deficiency can be improved by Fer-1, a specific inhibitor of ferroptosis in mice, indicating ferroptosis involved in the mechanism of SD-induced cognitive deficiency (Wang X. et al., 2021, 2022). In addition, our previous study found that KD could improve chronic SD-induced hippocampal damage by inhibiting ferroptosis in younger mice (7-week-old). Accordingly, we investigated the effect of KD on ferroptosis-related indicators, including iron deposition, and lipid peroxides accumulation .",86824e5b-d18f-4b6a-8674-536183700c4d
24,discussion6," Improved Perls staining revealed that obviously intracellular iron accumulation in the hippocampus in the SD group mice in our present study. The results were supported by previous studies showing that an increase in intracellular iron in SD exposed mice (Wang X. et al., 2021, 2022). Similar to our previous study, the up-regulation of intracellular iron was reversed by KD treatment (Wang X. et al., 2022). What’s more, it has been demonstrated that iron accumulation can worsen senile plaque deposition and promote tau phosphorylation (Wang F. et al., 2022). More β-secretase is activated in the presence of excessive iron and then accelerating the Aβ production and amyloid deposition (Ayton et al., 2020; Gleason and Bush, 2021). In addition, Ayton and colleagues conducted a research demonstrating an association between iron accumulation and steeper rate of cognitive decline in subjects displaying significant amyloid plaques and tau tangles .",f3eae941-491a-470c-a61f-ace0ccb246b7
25,discussion7," Hence, the prophylactic effects of KD on SD-induced AD can be partially attributed to its inhibition of iron overload in the hippocampus.  Iron is uptake by TFR1 (Fe3+) or DMT1 (Fe2+) and can be temporarily stored in the ferritin in the cytoplasm after being oxidated by FTH1 to prevent its toxicity or exported by the membrane protein FPN1 to maintain intracellular iron homeostasis. Neuron maintains intracellular iron homeostasis by modulating the expression of above iron transporter proteins via the IRP/IRE (iron-responsive element) system . IRPs regulate the iron homeostasis by binding to IRE of aforementioned iron transporter proteins’ mRNAs dependent on cellular iron status . IRPs increase intracellular active iron via upregulating TfR1, downregulating FTH1 and FPN1. However, abnormal increase of IRPs can lead to the intracellular iron accumulation and thereby promoting ferroptosis.",ec1cd696-cadf-409c-8846-92e4d46ba803
26,discussion8," Animals with targeted deletions of IRP1 and IRP2 have demonstrated that IRP2 serves as the primary physiologic iron sensor, while IRP1 competes with IRP2 in regulating cellular iron homeostasis in response to ROS (Meyron-Holtz et al., 2004). We found SD elevated the expression of IRP1 rather than IRP2, thereby increasing TfR1 and DMT1, decreasing FTH1 and FPN1, leading to intracellular iron increase and deposition in the hippocampus. Nevertheless, KD successfully suppressed the up-regulation of IRP1, subsequently modified SD-induced abnormality of iron transporters with diminished iron aggregation. These results revealed that KD prevented chronic SD-induced AD by inhibiting hippocampal iron dyshomeostasis.  Excess active iron promotes ROS production via the Fenton reaction, leading to lipid peroxides accumulation and thereby triggering ferroptosis. It has been well-believed that lipid peroxide Malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation could present the development of ferroptosis (Yuan et al.",ff5c845f-3902-4d7b-b155-0fa092229c4a
27,discussion9,", 2020). GPX4/xCT system is the main lipid peroxide removal system by reducing lipid peroxides to non-toxic lipid alcohols . Inhibition of GPX4 in neurons causes cognitive deficiency and neurodegeneration . FSP1 is in parallel with GPX4/xCT system to suppress ferroptosis by reducing lipid peroxidation by producing a reduced form of CoQ10, a well-known potent antioxidant . Consistent with the elevated iron, an increase in Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, a reduction in glutathione (GSH) level, as well as in FSP1, xCT and GPX4 expression were presented in the hippocampus of SD group mice. These effects were suppressed by KD treatment, suggesting that KD can promote lipid peroxide removal by elevating GPX4/xCT system and FSP1 to prevent ferroptosis. These above results verified our previous speculation, KD could prevent the occurrence of chronic SD-induced AD partly by inhibiting ferroptosis.",2b86179c-e770-4ddd-a07c-9f4bf8edb45c
28,discussion10,"  Based on the results aforementioned, we further explored the signaling pathways by which KD was exerting its effect on neuroprotection. As a class III histone deacetylase, Sirt1 plays a role in neuroprotection and longevity (Wang C. et al., 2021). Up-regulation of the expression of Sirt1 can improve cognitive function, and prevent the onset of AD . Zuo et al. (2020) demonstrated that H2S can prevent SD-induced hippocampal damage by up-regulating Sirt1 expression in the hippocampus, but this effect can be reversed by the Sirt1 inhibitor in rats. What’s more, it has been reported that melatonin alleviates short-term SD-induced memory loss in mice by suppressing hippocampal ferroptosis (Wang X. et al., 2021) and increasing hippocampal Sirt1 (Hinojosa-Godinez et al., 2019). These results indicate that Sirt1 may participate in the regulation of ferroptosis but less has been reported about the mechanism of Sirt1 on ferroptosis.",17c7974c-2fc0-4cf0-9ffa-16f8f265ac9a
29,discussion11," Nrf2, a key regulator of the cellular antioxidant response, is a downstream target of Sirt1 and has been linked to neurodegenerative disease treatment and ferroptosis regulation. Activation of Nrf2 could against chronic SD-induced memory impairment in rats . Moreover, a recent study using the EX527 (an inhibitor of SIRT1) proved the anti-ferroptosis effect of Sirt1/Nrf2 pathway in a sepsis mice model . A recent study demonstrated that Nrf2 induction could prevent ferroptosis in Friedreich’s Ataxia (La Rosa et al., 2021). Currently, it has been proved that Nrf2 not only contributes to mitigation of lipid peroxidation by activating GPX4/xCT axis  but also modulates celluar iron homeostasis by increasing the expression of iron transport proteins FTH1 and FPN1 (Kerins and Ooi, 2018). In agreement with our previous study (Wang X. et al., 2022), we found that KD up-regulated the expression of Sirt1 and Nrf2 in SD exposed mice.",765e5ff9-5c99-4085-9c09-4fd6e07c53a5
30,discussion12," In addition, Sirt1-Nrf2 is also associated with the neurogenesis by up-regulate the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and doublecortin (DCX) . These above results prompted us to conclude that KD prevents chronic SD-induced AD via Sirt1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.  In summary, our present study first demonstrated the prophylactic effect of KD on SD-induced AD in wild-type mice models via activating the Sirt1-Nrf2 pathway in the hippocampus. Our findings may provide new perspectives on the dietary treatment of AD.
