0,methods0," Animals.  All animal experiments were conducted on offspring of Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories). The neonatal model of symptomatic IS has been well established as described before (11, 12). Briefly, the day of birth was considered as P0, and on P3, litters were culled to 8 animals. Animals were divided into 2 experimental groups: sham animals that received saline, or epilepsy induction who received doxorubicin/LPS/p-chlorophenylalanine. On P4, intracerebral infusions of doxorubicin and LPS were done stereotaxically under hypothermic anesthesia using the stereotaxic frame (Leica Biosystems). Doxorubicin was injected into the right lateral ventricle followed by LPS into the right parietal cortex (12). The following coordinates were used. Doxorubicin (5 μg/2.5μL): 2.68 mm anterior to lambda, 1.1 mm lateral to sagittal suture, 3.3 mm deep; LPS (3 μg/1.5μL): 2.55 mm anterior to lambda, 1 mm lateral to sagittal suture, 1.7 mm deep.",622e1035-f2ee-4668-857a-cccc82c73fd2
1,methods1," In the morning at P5, animals were injected with p-chlorophenylalanine 200 mg/kg i.p. Sterile saline was used as the vehicle for the 3 injections. Animals were individually placed in beakers warmed in a water bath (45°C) and filled with bedding material (31°C–33°C). Artificial rearing was started once animals had fully recovered from the anesthesia. Animals were continuously fed either a control milk diet (CD, 1.7:1 of fats/carbohydrate + protein) or an isocaloric KD (4:1 of fats/carbohydrate + protein) from P4 to P8. This limited experimental time frame was chosen due to ethical reasons including the highly invasive nature of the surgery and its severe developmental outcomes in animals. It is also a period when animals experience a high rate of seizures and when the antiseizure impacts of the KD mimics what is observed in children with seizure reductions in the range of 50% (3, 11). The milk infusion rate was calculated daily based on the average body weight of the groups.",dc6973f5-3926-45c4-aa33-1ba664218089
2,methods2," The milk volume was increased by 2% each day. Detailed nutrient ingredients can be found in Supplemental Table 1.  Antibiotic treatment.  On P5, animals described above were randomly assigned to the control or antibiotic treatment. An Abx mixture was added to formula at the daily dosage of 20 mg/kg vancomycin (V2002, MilliporeSigma), 50 mg/kg neomycin (N6386, MilliporeSigma), 50 mg/kg ampicillin (A9393, MilliporeSigma), and 10 mg/kg metronidazole (M3761, MilliporeSigma). These dosages were chosen based on therapeutic levels given to infants and were designed to deplete gut microbiota (44, 45). The dosage given was converted based on the milk speed during artificial rearing and the body weight per day to ensure the corresponding amount of antibiotics being reliably administered. The resulting experimental groups in the antibiotic experiment were control diet epilepsy (CDE), control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Abx, KD epilepsy induction (KDE), and KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Abx.",a3211705-6def-438f-848a-ed250de4f8a7

S. thermophilus HA-110, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis HA-136, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius HA-118 (previously described as Lactobacillus salivarius) (46) were provided as pure strains by Lallemand Health Solutions. Microbes were freshly rehydrated in double-distilled water at 1 × 1010 CFU per mL. A total of 100 μL or water or probiotic was gavaged per animal, per day. S. thermophilus HA-110 and L. lactis HA-136 were mixed in a 5:1 ratio based on findings discussed below. The resulting experimental groups were as follows: control diet epilepsy (CDE), control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Pro, KD epilepsy induction (KDE), and KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Pro.

A total of 4 hours of recordings on P7 were quantified per animal. Spasms were quantified by date and by a single reviewer, who was blinded to the treatments.  Neurobehavioral testing.  Surface righting, negative geotaxis (47), and open-field tests (11) were performed in a blind manner as previously described on P7. For open-field test, the animal was placed in the center of a box (20 cm length × 20 cm width × 25cm height) above a camera equipped with a tracking system (TopScan tracking) and was allowed to move freely for 5 minutes. Animal movements were quantified with Ethovision XT software.  Blood and serum measurements.

10,results0," KD reduces seizures, altering the gut microbiota and circulating metabolites.  To investigate the effects of KD on mitigating spasms, we employed a neonatal rodent model of IS (11, 12). Neonatal rats were intracerebrally injected with doxorubicin and LPS at P4, and i.p. injected with chlorophenylalanine at P5 to induce spasms. Four experimental treatment groups were examined: control diet saline (control diet saline (CDS)) injected; control diet epilepsy (control diet epilepsy (CDE)) induction; KD saline injected (KD saline injected (KDS)); and KD epilepsy induction (KD epilepsy induction (KDE)). Compared with the control diet epilepsy (CDE), KD epilepsy induction (KDE) significantly reduced seizure frequency (P = 0.003, Figure 1A).  To explore gut microbiota alterations with the diets, we next analyzed fecal microbiota structures.",0716b87b-ff20-488a-82d6-a3592d9e0515
11,results1," The Abundance-based Coverage Estimator (Abundance based Coverage Estimator (ACE)) index represents the community richness of the gut microbiota, which is a parameter of α-diversity. The KD increased the Abundance based Coverage Estimator (ACE) index in KD epilepsy induction (KDE) compared with control diet epilepsy (CDE) groups (P = 0.023, Figure 1B). The difference was driven by several samples with elevated values, indicating high variation within the KD epilepsy induction (KDE) groups. Diet had significant impact on the relative abundance of Actinobacteria (Pdiet = 0.003, Figure 1C). The KD reduced relative abundances of Actinobacteria (P = 0.029 for KD epilepsy induction (KDE) versus control diet epilepsy (CDE), Figure 1C). Relative abundances of dominant species are presented in Figure 1D, including Enterococcus hirae, Ligilactobacillus animalis (previously described as Lactobacillus animalis), and Streptococcus thermophilus.",c8febb97-283d-4344-b543-bec5a58df974
12,results2," There were significant effects of diet on relative abundances of Leuconostoc lactis (Pdiet = 0.002), S. thermophilus (Pdiet = 0.009), and L. animalis (Pdiet = 0.009, Figure 1E). In IS animals, the KD increased relative abundances of L. lactis (P = 0.044) and S. thermophilus (P = 0.022) while decreasing those of L. animalis (P = 0.017) compared with animals fed the control diet (control diet epilepsy (CDE)) (Figure 1E). To gain insight into alterations in microbial functions affected by the KD, microbiota functional potential was explored in the IS groups. Results showed an upregulation of arachidonic acid metabolism and vitamin and cofactor metabolism including ascorbate, thiamine, and pantothenate with KD (P < 0.05, Figure 1F). Given that ascorbate and thiamine are well-known antioxidants in vivo, they may affect both seizure susceptibility and systemic metabolism.",2f0eebf8-b22a-4cb1-b10a-1ca2e888563f
13,results3,"  To investigate if KD-induced microbiota alterations were paralleled in peripheral and central metabolic shifts, samples from control diet epilepsy (CDE) and KD epilepsy induction (KDE) were used for metabolomics profiling. The KD epilepsy induction (KDE) led to a distinct metabolic status both in serum (cross-validated ANOVA [CV-ANOVA], P < 0.001) and hippocampus (CV-ANOVA, P < 0.001) compared with control diet epilepsy (CDE), as shown in Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) plots (Figure 2, A and B). Among the discriminant metabolites, we identified an increase of lipid and mitochondria energy metabolism relatives (β-hydroxybutyric acid, lipoyl-GMP), and antioxidant relatives (glycine, N-acetyldopamine) in both serum and hippocampus (variable importance of projection [VIP] > 1, P < 0.05, Figure 2C).",92aa5bed-44ea-49a7-a770-96d96e8857b5
14,results4," Additionally, the KD increased taurocholic acid, glutarylcarnitine, acetoacetic acid in the serum, and 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine, linoleyl carnitine, glutathione in the hippocampus (VIP > 1, P < 0.05, Figure 2C). Pathway analysis further identified the numerical upregulation of several pathways involved in branched-chain amino acid, ketone, and glutathione metabolism (P < 0.05, Figure 2D). Similar upregulation of serum β-hydroxybutyric acid, glycine, and taurocholic acid have also been observed in an adult mouse model of epilepsy (8). Collectively, these results support shifts in the metabolic phenotype of animals following KD treatment.  Antibiotics further mitigate seizures and are additive with the KD.  Since seizure frequency is influenced by antibiotic use (13), we used this experimental approach to investigate the association between the gut microbiota and the impacts of the KD in IS.",ec57a58e-3447-4065-be70-6f9d8f977219
15,results5," To deplete the gut microbiota, epileptic animals were exposed to a cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Abx) in their formula. Results show that antibiotics further increased KD efficacy in decreasing seizure scores (P < 0.001 for KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Abx versus control diet epilepsy (CDE), P = 0.039 for KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Abx versus KD epilepsy induction (KDE)) (Figure 3A). Both diet and antibiotics affected the seizure scores (Pdiet < 0.001, PAbx< 0.001) (Figure 3A). Antibiotic treatment resulted in the control diet epilepsy (CDE) group having greater weight gain than KD epilepsy induction (KDE) (P =0.055) and KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Abx (P = 0.099, Figure 3B). In control diet epilepsy (CDE), antibiotics increased the relative liver weight compared with their untreated counterparts (P = 0.002, Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.158521DS1).",94c846b8-ff7d-43d1-8131-ce65b8da7388
16,results6," Relative to control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Abx, antibiotics in KD epilepsy induction (KDE) animals showed higher brain weight (P = 0.05) but lower liver weight (P = 0.023, Supplemental Figure 1A). The antibiotic treatment regimen reduced the fecal bacteria load in both CD-fed (P = 0.016, control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Abx versus control diet epilepsy (CDE)) and KD-fed animals (P < 0.001, KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Abx versus KD epilepsy induction (KDE); Figure 3C). KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Abx animals had the highest α-diversity, as indicated by the increased number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs; P < 0.001 for KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Abx versus control diet epilepsy (CDE)) and the Chao1 index (P < 0.001 for KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Abx versus control diet epilepsy (CDE)) (Supplemental Figure 1B).

17,results7," At the genus level, antibiotics exerted similar effects in control diet epilepsy (CDE) and KD epilepsy induction (KDE), including increases in the relative abundances of Streptococcus (P = 0.002 for KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Abx versus control diet epilepsy (CDE)) and Lactococcus (P < 0.001 for KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Abx versus control diet epilepsy (CDE)) and a decrease in Lactobacillus (P = 0.077 for KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Abx versus control diet epilepsy (CDE)) and Enterococcus (P = 0.015 for KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Abx versus control diet epilepsy (CDE)) (Figure 3D and Supplemental Figure 1D). There was a statistically significant 3-way interaction between diet, epilepsy, and antibiotics on Streptococcus (Pinteraction < 0.001) and Lactococcus (Pinteraction = 0.001) (Figure 3D). Overall, the antibiotic treatment reduced seizure occurrence and changed the fecal microbiota.  Targeted gut microbiota manipulation for IS.",04ae8c43-b282-4e57-af84-9df24e4b3bf9
18,results8,"  It is likely that both the KD and antibiotic interventions eliminated bacterial species or metabolic by-products that may affect seizures — or that they enhanced the growth of others that reduced seizures. To this end, we sought common microbes that increased in both the KD and antibiotic treatments, both of which significantly reduced seizure frequency. We chose candidates that changed similarly with both treatments and were known psychobiotics, species known to influence the gut-brain axis (14, 15). Among the common species affected by the KD and antibiotics, we noted the remarkable increase of S. thermophilus from 0.2% to 7.80% (39-fold, P < 0.001) and L. lactis from < 0.01% to 1.22% (>100 fold, P < 0.001) (Figure 3E). There was a statistically significant 3-way interaction between diet, epilepsy, and antibiotics on S. thermophilus (Pinteraction < 0.001) and L. lactis (Pinteraction = 0.001) (Figure 3E).",64b11a4d-f7b8-478d-b4c2-d210b7ce1476
19,results9," Quantification of bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies showed that, although the counts of S. thermophilus and L. lactis were reduced after antibiotics, the abundances inferred from the gene copies (copies per taxa divided by total 16S rRNA gene copies) were increased, a finding consistent with our sequencing results (Supplemental Figure 2). The differences were further confirmed when comparing KD epilepsy induction (KDE) and KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Abx using a linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) algorithm (linear discriminant analysis [LDA] score > 2, Figure 4A). We then constructed the correlation matrix between species (Figure 4B). A significant positive correlation was identified between OTU9 and OTU13 (Spearman’s ρ = 0.812, P < 0.001), corresponding to S. thermophilus and L. lactis (Figure 4C), respectively, indicating significant cooccurrence.

Impact of a targeted or negative control probiotic in a model of IS.  Next, the impact of the targeted probiotic in the IS model was investigated. Compared with control diet epilepsy (CDE) animals, the inclusion of the probiotic significantly reduced seizure frequency to levels observed in the KD epilepsy induction (KDE) group (P < 0.001 versus control diet epilepsy (CDE), Figure 5A).

As anticipated, KD epilepsy induction (KDE) and KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Probiotics (Pro) animals had higher blood ketone concentrations than the other groups (P < 0.001, Figure 5C). No differences were observed for control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Pro and control diet epilepsy (CDE) animals (P = 0.997), suggesting that the effects of the probiotic were likely ketone independent (Figure 5C). control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Pro rats tended to exhibit increased blood glucose concentrations compared with control diet epilepsy (CDE) animals (P = 0.069, Figure 5D). Similar elevations were also observed in the control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Lsa group. Behavior analysis showed control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Pro (P = 0.",a9897e21-7252-48e6-9604-378095477c20

In the open field activity test, KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Pro animals had a decrease in the distance travelled compared with the control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Pro group (P = 0.015, Figure 5G). There was a statistically significant 3-way interaction between diet, probiotics and negative strain on spasms (Pinteraction < 0.001, Figure 5A), ketone concentration (Pinteraction < 0.001, Figure 5C), and surface righting time (Pinteraction = 0.013, Figure 5E).  Probiotics shift the gut microbiota and alter host metabolism.  Fecal microbiota profiling validated the impact of oral probiotic colonization. The microbiota composition was distinct across groups (pair-wise AMOVA, P < 0.01, Figure 6A).",f842b56c-209f-4d84-b1ff-a689456e12de
23,results13," At the species level, the between-group differences were reflected by the relative abundances of dominant taxa (Figure 6B), driven by S. thermophilus and L. lactis, L. animalis, and L. salivarius. Compared with control diet epilepsy (CDE), control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Pro and control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Lsa showed some similar effects with decreases in S. aureus and E. hirae and with increases in S. thermophiles (P < 0.05). However, L. lactis was solely increased in control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Pro (Figure 6C). Analysis of the predicted metagenomics function showed that both control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Pro and KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Pro upregulated arachidonic acid metabolism compared with control diet epilepsy (CDE) (P < 0.05) and numerically increased those involved in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, folate biosynthesis, and vitamin B6 metabolism (Supplemental Figure 3).  Next, we analyzed the metabolomic profiles in both the serum and hippocampus.",ee45d65b-5e36-455d-80de-18e09f74a38a
24,results14," The hippocampus was targeted because of the well-established association between epilepsy susceptibility and this brain structure (17). In the serum, CD and KD administration led to distinct clusters, with control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Lsa clustered separately (CV-ANOVA, P < 0.001, Figure 7A). In the hippocampus, treatments also showed significant impact on the overall metabolic profiles (CV-ANOVA, P < 0.001, Figure 7B). Here, probiotic treatment altered the relative concentrations of metabolites involved in amino acid metabolism (serine, threonine), glutathione metabolism (glycine, ornithine, glutathione), and purine metabolism (allantoin, hypoxanthine, inosine 2’-phosphate, adenosine monophosphate) (P < 0.05, Figure 7C).

As shown in Figure 8, a series of cytokines and chemokines were affected. In parallel with the decreasing number of seizures, control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Pro, KD epilepsy induction (KDE), and KD epilepsy induction (KDE) + Pro (seizure remission groups) had lower concentrations of IL-18 (P = 0.014, 0.354, and 0.205, respectively), IL-6 (P = 0.121, 0.05, and 0.02, respectively), and higher IL-5 (P = 0.347, 0.416, and 0.035, respectively), all of which showed opposite direction in the negative control control diet epilepsy (CDE) + Lsa (no seizure remission) compared with control diet epilepsy (CDE).

26,discussion0," The gut microbiota is emerging as a key player in epilepsy, influencing the onset and frequency of seizures (8, 19). While there is growing evidence concerning the role of the diet and the gut microbiota in adult epilepsy, less is known about specific pediatric epilepsy subtypes, including IS. IS is distinct, as it occurs early in life when the microbiota is relatively immature. Our results indicate that the KD changes the gut microbiota and host metabolism, and that some of these alterations can be effectively recapitulated by administration of a targeted probiotic.  The KD is employed clinically around the globe to treat drug-resistant epilepsy in both children and adults. While the mechanism of action of the KD has been a subject of intense scientific interest, emerging preclinical work now shows it to be highly dependent on the gut microbiota (8, 20, 21).",3279558e-d259-4d0a-aff3-556536b9a318
27,discussion1," Herein, we extend current knowledge to include IS, demonstrating the KD to effectively mitigate seizures compared with a control diet. Analysis of the gut microbiota revealed an increase in the Abundance based Coverage Estimator (ACE) index, an estimate of species richness and α-diversity. This finding is discordant with other studies showing either no change (22) or a decrease in α-diversity with the diet (23). At the phylum level, Actinobacteria was reduced with KD administration, replicating previous work showing it to progressively decline with decreasing carbohydrate in the diet (24). Specific to IS animals, the KD increased relative abundances of S. thermophilus while decreasing those of L. animalis compared with the control diet.  Microbial changes associated with the KD were accompanied by an induction of serum metabolites involved in lipid processing (taurocholic acid) and ketogenesis (β-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid).",8804b083-3f26-481f-bcd9-6020a0315854
28,discussion2," Additionally, the KD upregulated serum and hippocampal metabolites involved in antioxidant and antiinflammation processes, such as glutathione, glycine, and N-acetyldopamine. Earlier studies have found that patients with epilepsy have a reduced level of cerebral glutathione (25) and that the KD increases glutathione in the brain of patients with intractable epilepsy (26). We also note an increase in N-acetyldopamine in both the serum and hippocampus after the KD. N-acetyldopamine is a dopamine derivative with antioxidant and antiinflammation activities that reduce superoxide and TNF-α in cells exposed to a stimulus (27). It is possible that the increase of antioxidant status contributes to seizure mitigation following the KD. Taken together, these findings indicate that KD-induced antioxidant upregulation is likely consistent across different epilepsy subtypes, including IS.  To gain further insights into the role of the gut microbiota in IS, antibiotics were administered.",ca78c975-605d-4fff-9cf4-25c9f9ac7539
29,discussion3," Antibiotics further reduced seizure frequency in our model, which was a somewhat unexpected finding. Examination of the fecal microbiota showed increases in S. thermophilus and L. lactis with antibiotic administration, with a corresponding reduction in spasms. These microbes are also known to exert psychotropic effects by regulating brain activity and reducing inflammation (28, 29). Likewise, maternal exposure of L. lactis reduced anxiety-like behavior and improved the development of cortical architecture in mice, which may be involved in immunological regulation by the microbe (30). However, we cannot rule out the microbiota-independent and other off target effects of antibiotics on seizure protection. Antibiotics such as metronidazole can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, especially in young infants (31), while β-lactam–based compounds may upregulate brain synaptic glutamate transporters that, in turn, alter neuronal signaling and seizure potential (32).",ea6c7fcb-11bb-4a51-862e-99f82a0753dc
30,discussion4," These and other off-target impacts should be explored in future studies.  It should be noted that the microbes identified in this study are distinct compared with the work of Olson et al. (8), who identified Akkermansia muciniphila and Parabacteroides spp. in adult mice with refractory epilepsy. However, there are several important differences between the aforementioned work and the present study that need to be considered. First, gut microbiota species implicated in adults are rarely present in neonates. Members of Akkermansia and Parabacteroides species are rarely detected in the infant gut microbiota, which is premature and dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, in both humans and rodents (33, 34). Since IS typically manifests early in life when the gut microbiota is still developing, it is not surprising that different microbes might play a role in IS and adult epilepsy.",3e449ccf-1e15-4a18-a338-022b0dbc5596
31,discussion5," Second, there are likely differences in the permeability of the blood-brain-barrier to bacteria-derived metabolites between infants and adults. Data in the present study were generated in young, P4–P8 rats whose efferent projections are not developed and who have a leaky blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain-barrier is not firmly established in these animals until P16 (35), corresponding to approximately 1 year of age in children. Given these considerations, findings highlight the need to study different epilepsy subtypes, including IS as well as the developmental stage of animals when examining the gut microbiota.  A potentially novel finding of the present study is the creation of a targeted probiotic that recapitulates some of the metabolic and immunological benefits conferred by the KD. Employing data obtained from both KD and antibiotic experiments, we determined that the combination of S. thermophilus and L. lactis were strong candidates.",fb195663-2ce6-42a7-ad65-c90da6226a73
32,discussion6," These microbes were increased in our manipulations, strongly correlated to one another, and have documented psychobiotic properties (15). Notably, we show that administration of this mixture in a 5:1 ratio, a level observed in the feces, ameliorated seizures and improved locomotor behavior in our model. This finding is strengthened by our use of a negative control, L. salivarius, that had no effect on seizures or behaviors and supports the species-specific regulation by our selected gut microbes. At present, the independent (single species) as well as the synergistic interactions of these 2 probiotic species on IS tested are not known. In summary, the observed improvements by a targeted probiotic on infantile spasms pave the way for a potentially new therapy involving microbiota manipulation.",40168250-0672-438d-ae8b-96a260afa9f4
33,discussion7,"  In control diet animals with IS, probiotic administration induced some of the metabolic and immunological benefits conferred by the KD, such as increases in serum glutathione and decreases in proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-α. Differences were also observed in the hippocampus, with probiotics inducing antioxidant and antiinflammatory pathways. From the present data, we are unable to discern whether changes in cytokines were a cause or were a result of reduced spasms. However, based on the ability of selected probiotics to suppress chronic inflammation and oxidative damage (21, 36), we suspect that the administered probiotics may ameliorate inflammatory responses, contributing to the observed anticonvulsant effects.  Comparable with the KD, targeted probiotics increased glutathione and glycine in our control diet animals.",a7a2cb86-5aeb-4c5d-a0da-724354d233fb
34,discussion8," Upregulation of antioxidant processes are thought to be favorable for bioenergetic reserve capacity and reducing reactive oxygen species, both of which may help to stabilize synaptic functions (37). This may be due to an upregulation of microbes involved in ascorbate and vitamin B6 metabolism, each of which can regulate glutathione metabolism and antioxidant status (38, 39). These lines of evidence strongly support a relationship between glutathione metabolism and the gut microbiota in IS. Additional metabolites of interest include increases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)) and glycerol 3-phosphate solely in control diet animals administered probiotics compared with those without. Glycerol 3-phosphate could be used to rapidly regenerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ in the brain (40).",b74754f3-65c5-47e7-adcf-406273e682f6
35,discussion9," nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ is essential for maintaining ion channel activities, maintaining mitochondrial health, and reducing oxidative stress (41). nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ treatment reduces spontaneous recurrent seizures by reducing neuronal loss in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in a mouse model (42). Additionally, the decrease of proinflammatory cytokines implicates an immunological mechanism by which probiotics may affect seizure occurrence. Overall, alterations of these metabolic and inflammatory signatures suggest potential mechanisms through which probiotics may be protective against epileptic seizures.  Limitations of this study include the use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics sequencing would have provided a more comprehensive picture of microbial structure and function. In addition, our study design did not examine temporal seizure patterns but, rather, a limited time frame (4 hours/animal).",6074fa33-e0f5-4250-b15c-8518aac94865
36,discussion10," Given this, it is possible that the temporal effects of seizures were missed — a limitation that should be addressed in future studies. Next, the ability of the probiotic to reduce spasms should also be replicated in another drug-responsive model of IS. However, few other models besides the multiple-hit IS model employed here are drug responsive (43). Along these lines, future work could also perform fecal transplant experiments to mechanistically implicate the microbiota dependency of the targeted probiotic.  In conclusion, our studies indicate that specific members of the neonatal gut microbiota have the capacity to regulate seizures, regulate behavior, and shift the metabolic landscape toward an antioxidant status in a model of IS. Together, these findings strengthen the potential therapeutic role of microbiota manipulation by probiotic administration as a potentially novel and complementary approach to prevent seizures and improve developmental outcomes in IS.
