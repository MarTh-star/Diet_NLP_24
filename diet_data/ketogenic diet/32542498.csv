0,introduction0," Aging-driven reduced resilience to infections is dependent in part on the restricted T cell repertoire diversity together with impaired T and B cell activation as well as inflammasome-driven low-grade systemic inflammation that compromises innate immune function (Akbar and Gilroy, 2020; Camell et al., 2017; Youm et al., 2013). Consequently, 80% of deaths due to COVID-19 in USA are in adults >65 years old (https://www.cdc.gov/), and aging is the strongest factor to increase infection fatality (Pastor-Barriuso et al., 2020; Perez-Saez et al., 2021; Ward et al., 2020). Lack of an aging animal model that mimics SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology has been a major limitation in the effort to determine the mechanism of disease and to develop effective therapeutics for the elderly. Inability of mouse ACE2 to bind SARS-CoV-2 is a significant hurdle in understanding the basic mechanism of COVID-19.",d530e026-7abe-4bbe-8599-b0bd9053fa02
1,introduction1," Accordingly, several approaches have been employed to develop models including introduction of human-ACE2 in mice and transient induction of hACE2 through adenoviral-associated vectors. These models have begun to yield important information on the mechanism of disease development. For example, epithelial cell-specific induction of hACE2 (K18-hACE2) as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated that post-intranasal inoculation, animals develop lung inflammation and pneumonia driven by infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells . Also, initial studies that employ lung-ciliated epithelial cell-specific HFH4/FOXJ1 promoter-driven hACE2 transgenic mice show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces weight loss, lung inflammation, and approximately 50% mortality rate, suggesting the usefulness of this model to understand the mechanism of immune dysregulation .",5a781237-6c6c-42d5-ab12-c11b5ce6f564
2,introduction2," However, significant hurdles remain to understand the mechanism and test therapeutic interventions that are relevant to disease severity in elderly, as complicated breeding and specific mutations need to be introduced in hACE2 transgenic strains in addition to the time required to age these models. The mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno-associated virus (AAV)–mediated expression of hACE2 may allow circumvention of the above constrains. The delivery of hACE2 into the respiratory tract of C57BL/6 mice with AAV9 causes a productive infection as revealed by >200-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 RNA and shows similar interferon gene expression signatures as COVID-19 patients . However, in young wild-type mice, this model induces mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)) and does not cause neutrophilia, weight loss, or lethality .",b814913e-9b49-4f9d-937c-12abf1337379
3,introduction3," Other studies using replication-deficient adenovirus-mediated transduction of hACE in mice and infection with SARS-CoV-2 produced 20% weight loss including lung inflammation . Furthermore, genetic remodeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain that allow interaction with mACE demonstrated peribronchiolar lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates and epithelial damage but no weight loss in infected mice . Moreover, middle-aged female mice that are 1 year old, (analogous to approximately 43 year old human), display greater lung pathology and loss of function post-infection with 10% weight loss followed by spontaneous recovery 7 days post-infection .  The mouse hepatitis virus (mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)) and SARS-CoV-2 are both acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-related beta coronaviruses with a high degree of homology .",575f51cf-ec45-41d9-8fa7-b713ed53f55c
4,introduction4," Importantly, mCoV-A59 utilizes the entry receptor CEACAM1, which is expressed not only on respiratory epithelium, but also on enterocytes, endothelial cells, and neurons, much like ACE2 , thus allowing the study of wide-ranging systemic impacts of infection. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection is known to cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis . Importantly, however, the intranasal infection with mCoV-A59 is pneumotropic and causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in C57BL/6J animals, while all other mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains require the A/J or type-I interferon-deficient background, for the development of severe disease (De Albuquerque et al., 2006; Khanolkar et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2014) limiting their use.  Aging-induced chronic inflammation in the absence of overt infections is predominantly driven by the NLRP3 inflammasome (Bauernfeind et al., 2016; Camell et al., 2017; Youm et al.",48f2cd2a-39fa-4e80-ba6a-36dde24c80fb
5,introduction5,", 2013), a myeloid cell-expressed multiprotein complex that senses pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to cause the processing and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. There is increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection activates the NLRP3 inflammasome with increased levels of IL-18 and lactate dehydrogenase (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) levels due to inflammasome-mediated pyroptotic cell death . It is now known that increased glycolysis, which activates inflammasome, is associated with worsened COVID-19 outcome . This raises the question whether the substrate switch from glycolysis-to-ketogenesis can be employed to stave off COVID-19 in high-risk elderly population.",d303778e-e0e2-4c42-9d73-4b096e34e6c8
6,introduction6," Here, we establish that intranasal infection with mCoV-A59 recapitulates clinical features of COVID-19 seen in elderly and demonstrate that ketone metabolites protect against disease through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome and expansion of protective γδ T cells in lungs.

30,results0," mCoV-A59 infection in aged mice mimics COVID-19 severity  To determine the underlying deficits in immune and inflammatory response in aging, we investigated the impact of mCoV-A59 intranasal inoculation on adult (2–6 months) and old male mice (20–24 months) (Figure 1A). The LD-0 infectious dose of mCoV-A59 in adult (PFU 7e3) caused 100% lethality in aged mice (Figure 1B). Aged mice displayed greater weight loss (Figure 1C), hypoxemia (Figure 1D), and anorexia (Figure 1E), without a significant difference in viral load in lungs (Figure 1F) after infection (PFU 7e2) when compared to adults.

Immune profiling of the lung revealed that aged mice had significant reductions both in the percentage of CD4 cells and in the CD4:CD8 ratio in the lung compared to adult controls at steady state and after infection (Figure 1G,H, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).",ea7b5cdc-5f10-484e-b7b2-3e4961fdfc6c
33,results3," Interestingly, while ϒδ T cell numbers in the lung were significantly increased at steady state in aged mice compared to adult mice, both the proportion and number of ϒδ T cells in the lung were dramatically reduced only in aged mice after infection compared to adult mice (Figure 1I, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). In the spleen, ϒδ T cells were found to be reduced at steady state in aged mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).  Analyses of the myeloid compartment revealed that aged mice had significantly increased neutrophils in the lung post-infection with a trend toward increase in neutrophils at steady state (Figure 1J). We did not detect age-associated changes in eosinophils in lungs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Aging increased Ly6Chi monocytes, which rose further post-infection (Figure 1K, Figure 1—figure supplement 1D).",55b5e9a9-ced7-423b-9f93-7d883ba70c4f
34,results4," Moreover, the frequency and number of CD64+MerTK+ cells were highest in infected aged mice (Figure 1L, Figure 1—figure supplement 1D), while no significant differences were observed in the total population of alveolar or interstitial macrophages (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F) in lungs. These data suggest that post-sub-lethal infection, when young animals recover, aging is associated with delayed resolution of infection with prolonged infiltration of inflammatory myeloid cells and a dramatic reduction in γδ T cells in the lung.  Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the dissemination of the viral particles in pneumocytes in lungs (Figure 2A). The pneumotropism of mCoV-A59 was also validated by demonstration of viable mCoV-A59 in lungs using plaque assays, and aged mice did not show significant differences in viral load in lungs (Figure 1F).",2ed86391-0e12-439f-a641-2402a0d607c1
35,results5," Interestingly, following mCoV-A59 inoculation, pathology analyses by hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) and Martius scarlet blue trichrome (MSB) staining, in both 6 month and 20–24 month old mice, revealed perivascular inflammation (arrows, arrowhead) as well as perivascular edema (*) and increased perivascular collagen/fibrosis (Martius scarlet blue trichrome (MSB), blue) that is more severe in the 20–24 month mCoV-A59 infected mice (Figure 2B). Furthermore, 20–24 month old mice intranasally inoculated with mCoV-A59 have dense foci visible at low power (box) and amphophilic material (fibrosis) with few scattered brightly eosinophilic erythrocytes (gray arrowhead) admixed with lymphocytes and plasma cells.",7151d67e-a5f0-4027-a03f-24dfb0336c44
36,results6," By Martius scarlet blue trichrome (MSB) stain, at higher power, this same focus (***) in the 20–24 month infected mice revealed that the end of a small blood vessel (BV) terminates into a mass of collapsed alveoli, without obvious septa admixed with inflammatory cells, disorganized fibrin/collagen fibers (blue) suggestive of ante mortem pulmonary thrombosis in contrast with post-mortem blood clots where erythrocytes are yellow (** Martius scarlet blue trichrome (MSB), yellow) (Figure 2B). Taken together, consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the lungs of aged mice infected with mCoV-A59 had increased foci of inflammation, immune cell infiltration, perivascular edema, hyaline membrane formation and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, organizing pneumonia, interstitial pneumonitis, and occasional hemorrhage and microthrombi, affecting approximately 75% of the lungs (Figure 2B).

Aging enhances systemic inflammatory response in mCoV-A59 infected mice  We next investigated whether mCoV-A59 infection in aged mice mimics the hyperinflammatory systemic response seen in elderly patients infected with COVID-19. Compared to young animals, old mice infected with equivalent doses of mCoV-A59 displayed significant increase in circulating IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, and MCP-1 (Figure 3A–C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D), without affecting MIP-1β (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E). Similar to COVID-19, infection with mCoV-A59 caused increased cardiac inflammation in old mice as evaluated by greater number of infiltrating CD68+ myeloid cells (Figure 3D, Figure 3—figure supplement 1F).

Given that increased visceral adiposity is a risk factor for COVID-19 severity and expression of ACE2 is upregulated in adipocytes of obese and diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Kruglikov and Scherer, 2020), we next studied whether mCoV-A59 infection affects adipose tissue. Given the prevalence of obesity is 10% among younger adults aged 20–39, 45% among adults aged 40–59 years, and 43% among older adults aged 60 and over , we investigated adipose tissue inflammation as a potential mechanism that contributes to infection severity in the aged. Interestingly, consistent with the prior findings that adipose tissue can harbor several viruses , the mCoV-A59 RNA was detectable in visceral adipose tissue (visceral adipose tissue (VAT)) (Figure 3E, Figure 3—figure supplement 1G).",4619893a-e650-44ac-b262-487d606c18d8
43,results13," Despite similar viral loads, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of aged infected mice had significantly higher mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 (Figure 3F–H, Figure 3—figure supplement 1H–J). Moreover, consistent with prior work, aging is associated with increases in inflammasome activation (Figure 3I). Infection with mCoV-A59 further enhanced caspase-1 cleavage (p20 active heterodimer) as well as expression of inflammasome components, Casp1 and Nlrp3, in old mice (Figure 3I–K, Figure 3—figure supplement 1K). In addition, similar to SARS-CoV-2 invasiveness in central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)), the mCoV-A59 was detectable in the hypothalamus (Figure 3L, Figure 3—figure supplement 1L).",1ebafb9f-3680-4b6e-938d-790fc5a12265
44,results14," Compared to adults, the hypothalamus of aged infected mice showed increased mRNA expression of TNFα and caspase-1 (Figure 3M,N, Figure 3—figure supplement 1M,N) with no significant differences in IL-1β, IL-6 (Figure 3O,P, Figure 3—figure supplement 1O,P), and NLRP3 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1Q). Infection in both young and aged mice caused significant increases in markers of astrogliosis and microglia activation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1R,S). Interestingly, mCoV-A59 reduced the mRNA expression of orexigenic neuropeptide-Y (Figure 3—figure supplement 1R,S), consistent with the fact that infected mice display anorexia (Figure 1C,E). However, mCoV-A59 infection completely abolished the expression of pre-opiomelanocortin (pre opiomelanocortin (POMC)) in the hypothalamus, a transcript expressed by pre opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, which is involved in the control of the autonomic nervous system and integrative physiology.",e9e5beeb-8297-47c4-9223-30d716074475
45,results15," Further investigation will be necessary to test the involvement of the hypothalamus in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and organ failure due to alterations in the autonomic nervous system.  Ketogenic diet-mediated protection against mCoV-A59 infection in aging is coupled with inflammasome deactivation  Given the switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation reprograms the myeloid cell from pro-inflammatory to tissue reparative phenotype during infections (Ayres, 2020; Buck et al., 2017; Galván-Peña and O'Neill, 2014), we next investigated whether mCoV-A59-driven hyperinflammatory response in aging can be targeted through immunometabolic approaches. Hepatic ketogenesis, a process downstream of lipolysis that converts long-chain fatty acids into short chain β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as a preferential fatty acid fuel during starvation or glucoprivic states, inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Youm et al.",22699f69-03cf-4115-8bcf-6ebb55f7614c
46,results16,", 2015) and protects against influenza infection-induced mortality in mice . We infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with mCoV-A59 in vitro in TLR4 (Figure 4A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A) and TLR1/2 primed cells (Figure 4B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). Infection with mCoV-A59 caused robust activation of inflammasome as measured by cleavage of active IL-1β (p17) in BMDM supernatants (Figure 4A,B) as well as in cell lysates (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B). Given our prior findings that ketone metabolites specifically inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to sterile DAMPs such as ATP, ceramides, silica, and urate crystals , we next tested whether BHB impacts inflammasome activation caused by mCoV-A59.

50,results20,"  Interestingly, BHB treatment reduced pro and active cleaved IL-1β (p17) in both conditions when protein level was measured in the supernatant (Figure 4A,B) and cell lysate (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B). Mechanistically, post-mCoV-A59 infection, the BHB reduced the oligomerization of ASC, which is an adaptor protein required for the assembly of the inflammasome complex (Figure 4C,D). This data provides evidence that the ketone metabolite BHB can lower inflammation in response to coronavirus infection and deactivate the inflammasome. However, inflammasome activation is also required for mounting adequate immune response against pathogens including certain viruses. Therefore, we next investigated if induction of ketogenesis and ketolysis in vivo by feeding a diet rich in fat and low in carbohydrates that elevates BHB level impacts inflammasome and host defense against mCoV-A59 infection in aged mice.",86047d50-9b41-4ede-af2b-032ba3251b97
51,results21,"  We next tested whether ketogenic diet that increases BHB via mitochondrial metabolism affects the outcome of coronavirus infection in mice. Ketogenesis is dependent on hydrolysis of triglycerides and conversion of long-chain fatty acids in liver into short chain fatty acid BHB that serves as primary source of ATP for heart and brain when glucose is limiting. Aging is associated with impaired lipid metabolism which includes reduced lipolysis that generates free fatty acids that are essential substrates for BHB production. Thus, it is unclear whether in context of severe infection and aging, if sufficient ketogenesis can be induced. To test this, the aged male mice (20–21 months old) were fed a ketogenic diet (KD) or control diet for 5 days and then intranasally infected with mCoV-A59 (Figure 4E). Despite mCoV-A59’s known effects in causing hepatic inflammation (Navas et al.",809fa321-a908-474f-9c02-0ff267b427c4
52,results22,", 2001), we observed that compared to chow-fed animals, old KD-fed mice achieved mild physiological ketosis between 0.6 and 1 mM over the course of infection for 1 week (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C).  Compared to chow-fed animals, the mCoV-A59-infected mice fed KD displayed similar levels of food intake, blood glucose, core body temperature, heart rate, and respiration (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–I). Interestingly, mCoV-A59-infected KD-fed mice were protected from infection-induced weight loss and hypoxemia (Figure 4F,G). Furthermore, we infected young and old mice fed either chow or KD with a lethal dose of mCoV-A59 (PFU 1e6) to investigate whether KD affects mortality caused by mCoV-A59 infection (Figure 4H). Interestingly, compared to chow-fed controls, young mice fed KD prior to infection showed improved survival (Figure 4I). However, old mice fed KD were not protected from death caused by high-dose mCoV-A59-induced infection (Figure 4J).",f263c0c1-ac96-410b-beb5-91250fd9890e
53,results23," Together, these data show that KD is protective in aged mice in sub-lethal infections and partially protects adult, but not aged animals, from lethal coronavirus infections.  Induction of ketogenic substrate switch inhibits systemic inflammation in aged mCoV-A59 infection  Elderly COVID-19 patients exhibit multi-organ failure with systemic viremia and inflammation. Therefore, we next investigated the impact of KD on the inflammatory response in lungs, adipose tissue, and hypothalamus in old mice post-sub-lethal mCoV-A59 infection. Consistent with the improved clinical outcome and protection afforded by ketone bodies in infected mice, we found that KD-fed mice inoculated with mCoV-A59 had significantly reduced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 in lung, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and hypothalamus (Figure 5A–C). Aging and mCoV-A59 increases inflammasome activation, which is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (Vijay et al.",5f8320a3-8593-46a1-a44b-b29cc5de85ab
54,results24,", 2017; Youm et al., 2013). The SARS-CoV open-reading frame 3a (ORF3a) and ORF8b activates the NLRP3 inflammasome  by inducing ER stress and lysosomal damage . Moreover, ability of bats to harbor multiple viruses including coronaviruses is due to splice variants in the LRR domain of NLRP3, which prevents inflammasome-mediated inflammatory damage . Interestingly, in the aging mouse model of mCoV-A59 infection, KD significantly lowered NLRP3 and caspase-1 mRNA in lung, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and hypothalamus (Figure 5D,E), inflammasome activation in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (Figure 5F,G), and decreased myeloid cell infiltration in heart (Figure 5H).",507bc21e-47ca-4b8f-86c9-cf9657d6d906
55,results25," The ketogenesis in infected old mice did not affect the frequency of CD4, CD8 effector memory or macrophage subsets in lungs, suggesting that reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines was not a reflection of reduced infiltration of these cell types (Figure 5—figure supplements 1A–L and 2A–H). Interestingly, we found that KD feeding rescued mCoV-A59-induced depletion of ϒδ T cell in lungs of aged mice (Figure 5I, Figure 5—figure supplement 1A).  Figure 5.

Ketogenesis induces protective γδ T cells and decreases myeloid cell subset in mCoV-A59-infected old mice  To determine the mechanism of ketogenesis-induced protection from mCoV-A59-driven inflammatory damage in aging, we next investigated the transcriptional changes in lung at the single-cell level. The scRNA-sequencing of whole-lung tissues (Figure 6A, Figure 6—figure supplement 2A) found that KD feeding in old infected mice caused significant increase in goblet cells (Figure 6B), expansion of ϒδ T cells (Figure 6B) and significant decrease in proliferative cell subsets and monocyte populations (Figure 6B).",43c8c3b5-daa0-4e24-af2e-848758eaa1db
59,results29," When differential gene expression analyses were performed with the clusters, we observed only very modest changes within few clusters and no shared signature (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B). Comparison with scRNA-seq of the lungs from young and old infected animals highlighted the largest increase in B cells and club cells and reduction of proliferating myeloid cells, including Trem2+ macrophages and NK cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–D). The fraction of Foxp3-positive Treg cells were not different between young infected and old infected mice (Figure 6—figure supplement 1E–G). Notably, when differential gene expression and pathway analyses were performed (Figure 6—figure supplement 1H–K), the old infected mice showed a reduced interferon signature, suggesting increased vulnerability to the viral infection (Figure 6—figure supplement 1I,J).",4630c132-acf5-4dd1-b6f3-986d43aa4cc3
60,results30," Interestingly, some of the most striking changes occurred in T cells, where ketogenesis led to a substantial increase in ϒδ but not αβ T cells (Figure 6C, Figure 6—figure supplement 2C). To understand whether expansion of ϒδ T cells was also accompanied by the changes in their regulatory programs, we sorted the lung ϒδ T cells from aged mice fed chow diet and KD and conducted bulk RNA-sequencing to determine the mechanism of potential tissue protective effects of these cells in mCoV-A59 infection. We found that KD in aging significantly increased the genes associated with reduced inflammation (Figure 6D), increased lipoprotein remodeling and downregulation of TLR signaling, Plk1 and aurora B signaling pathways in ϒδ T cells (Figure 6E). However, there was no difference in mRNA expression levels of Vγ chain subtypes, IL-17, or IFN-γ (Figure 6—figure supplement 2D–F).",aa82e59b-0a6d-401c-8131-ee87c671b698
61,results31," Furthermore, RNA-sequencing revealed that lung ϒδ T cells from ketogenic mCoV-A59-infected old mice displayed elevated respiratory electron transport and complex I biogenesis (Figure 6E). In addition, Golgi to ER retrograde transport and cell cycle are downregulated, suggesting the reduced activation status of ϒδ T cell (Figure 6E). These data suggest that ϒδ T cells expanded with KD are functionally more homeostatic and immune protective against mCoV-A59 infection.  Figure 6.

66,results36," Strikingly, ketogenesis-induced change in the monocyte compartment was driven by a loss of cluster 1 (characterized by high levels of Chil3, Lmna, Il1r2, Lcn2, Cd33, Cd24a, Figure 6H, Figure 6—figure supplement 2G,H). The same clusters were identified in scRNA-sequencing with young and old infected mice and aging was only associated with reduction of the cluster 0 (Figure 6—figure supplement 2I–K). In addition, the loss of monocyte sub-population was observed in cells with low interferon response, further suggesting the immune protective response induction post-ketogenesis in infected mice. This is an intriguing finding that is consistent with recent observations that dietary interventions can impact plasticity of the monocyte pool in both mouse and human .

67,discussion0," Immune-senescence exemplified by inflammasome-mediated basal activation of myeloid cells, expansion of pro-inflammatory aged B cells, impaired germinal center, and antibody responses together with thymic demise and restriction of T cell repertoire diversity all contribute to increased risk of infections and vaccination failures in elderly (Akbar and Gilroy, 2020; Frasca et al., 2020; Goldberg and Dixit, 2015; Goronzy and Weyand, 2019). It is likely that multiple mechanisms partake in aging-induced mortality and morbidity to SARS-CoV-2. However, study of immunometabolic mechanisms that control aberrant inflammatory response in elderly COVID-19 patients is incompletely understood. Epidemiological data strongly support that elderly and aged individuals with late-onset chronic diseases – including diabetes, obesity, heart conditions, pulmonary dysfunctions, and cancer – present a much higher disease severity compared to young healthy adults .",5603398c-af59-4b4d-91fb-40021b11851a
68,discussion1," These observations suggest that it is the vulnerability of the various tissues that occur in these chronic conditions that predispose elderly to develop severe forms of COVID-19.  Rodent CoVs are natural, highly contagious pathogens of mice and rats . These viruses also offer the possibility of efficient and safe platforms for modeling COVID-19 and examining immunometabolic mechanisms and interventions that impact disease. Of particular interest for COVID-19 are the strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that are respiratory tropic . Given, these advantages, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) mCoV-A59 infection in C57BL/6 mice can be a powerful tool to rapidly study the disease as well as test therapeutic interventions.",39d5c0c4-7dc4-4aec-a1dd-411198b71288
69,discussion2," We demonstrate that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) mCoV-A59 infection in aged mice recapitulates severe features of COVID-19 that includes up to 30% weight loss, sickness behavior exemplified by anorexia, loss of oxygen saturation, lung pathology including neutrophilia, monocytosis, loss of γδ T cells, lymphopenia, increase in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, hypothalamic, adipose and cardiac inflammation, and inflammasome activation. Importantly, LD-0 dose of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) mCoV-A59 induces 100% lethality in 2 year old male mice, suggesting that this model allows investigation of COVID-19-relevant immunometabolic mechanisms that control disease development and severity with aging.  Mechanistically, NLRP3 inflammasome has been demonstrated to be an important driver of aging-induced chronic inflammation and organ damage (Bauernfeind et al., 2016; Camell et al., 2017; Youm et al., 2013).",f9c89b65-000e-4882-af1b-8cee6c4a6540
70,discussion3," COVID-19 patients have inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis and increase in IL-18 . Consistent with the hypothesis that aging may exacerbate inflammasome activation in SARS-CoV-2 infection, our data demonstrates that in vivo, mCoV infection increases NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation. Recent study shows that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 also activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro BMDM . In addition, severe cases of COVID-19 are accompanied with dysregulation of monocyte populations with increased level of S100A8/A9 or calprotectin (Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020; Silvin et al., 2020), which can prime and induce the inflammasome activation . Interestingly, the KD feeding blocked infiltration of pathogenic monocyte subset in lungs that has high S100A8/9 and low interferon expression.",a27c9c1f-558f-43c0-979d-bd0ceb9ab1db
71,discussion4," These data underscore that enhanced innate immune tolerance mediated by inflammasome deactivation maybe an important strategy against COVID-19.  The integrated immunometabolic response (integrated immunometabolic response (IIMR)) is critical in regulating the setpoint of protective versus pathogenic inflammatory response (Lee and Dixit, 2020). The integrated immunometabolic response (IIMR) involves sensing of nutrient balance by neuronal (sympathetic and sensory innervation) and humoral signals (e.g. hormones and cytokines) between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues that allow the host to prioritize storage and/or utilize substrates for tissue growth, maintenance, and protective inflammatory responses. Peripheral immune cells, both in circulation and those residing within tissues, are subject to regulation by the metabolic status of the host.",592a73a5-9f4c-4224-a840-465bf1f02db8
72,discussion5," Ketone bodies, BHB, and acetoacetate are produced during starvation to support the survival of host by serving as an alternative energy substrate when glycogen reserves are depleted (Newman and Verdin, 2017). Classically, ketone bodies are considered essential metabolic fuels for key tissues such as the brain and heart (Puchalska and Crawford, 2017; Veech et al., 2017). However, there is increasing evidence that immune cells can also be profoundly regulated by ketone bodies . For example, stable isotope tracing revealed that macrophage oxidation of liver-derived AcAc was essential for protection against liver fibrosis . Given our past findings that ketone bodies inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by sterile DAMPs, we next hypothesized that coronavirus mediated inflammasome activation and disease severity in aging could be improved by BHB driven improved metabolic efficiency and NLRP3 deactivation.",a72b4402-ad0d-4a46-b7a4-f50d8de29ee6
73,discussion6," In support of this hypothesis, we found that BHB inhibits the mCoV-A59-induced NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and KD reduces caspase-1 cleavage as well as decreases gene expression of inflammasome components. We next investigated the mechanism of protection elicited by KD that is relevant to aging. Interestingly, scRNA-sequencing analyses of lung homogenates of old mice fed KD revealed robust expansion of immunoprotective γδ T cells, which are reported to decline in COVID-19 patients . The KD activated the mitochondrial function as evidenced by enhanced complex-1 biogenesis and upregulation of ETC in immunoprotective γδ T cells. These results are consistent with a previous study reporting that KD-mediated enhancement of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is required for protection against flu infection. In the study, increasing BHB by feeding ketone esters could not mimic the effect of KD .",f57c94ec-8da5-4e99-a660-19d2927f5430
74,discussion7," This suggests an important role for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and hepatic ketogenesis in protection against viral infections.  Our findings assume strong clinical significance as recent studies demonstrate that γδ T cells were severely depleted in COVID-19 patients in two highly variable cohorts, and disease progression was correlated with near ablation of Vγ9Vδ2 cells that are dominant subtype of circulating γδ T cells . Taken together these data demonstrate that a ketogenic immunometabolic switch protects against mCoV-A59-driven infection in mice and this involves anti-inflammatory response in lung which is coupled with reduction of NLRP3 inflammasome, restoration of protective ϒδ T cells, and remodeling of the pool of the inflammatory monocytes.",59efa2ab-ff82-43fb-b1ff-410fe6b8d320
75,discussion8," Finally, our results suggest that acutely switching infected or at-risk elderly patients to a KD may ameliorate COVID-19 and, therefore, is a relatively accessible and affordable intervention that can be promptly applied in most clinical settings.
