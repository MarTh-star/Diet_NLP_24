0,introduction0,"The low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet (KD) is a remarkably effective treatment for medically intractable epilepsy and has been applied in the clinical setting for over 70 years.1 In addition, KDs have been widely applied in the clinical treatment of various diseases, such as diabetes,2 cancer,3,4 and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.5 KDs are also used by healthy individuals, predominantly to promote weight loss.6  Consumption of a KD forces the body to use fats rather than carbohydrates to generate energy. Three major forms of ketone bodies, namely acetoacetate (AcAc), β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB), and acetone, are generated in the liver during fatty acid oxidation and transported to extrahepatic tissues by the circulatory system. Circulating total ketone body concentrations in healthy adult humans normally exhibit circadian oscillations of ~100–250 μM.",c7207fc6-be0d-425b-bb6c-98bdd2d2e92c
1,introduction1," However, levels can reach 1–8 mM after KD consumption, prolonged exercise, or deep fasting and can be as high as 25 mM under pathological conditions, such as diabetic ketoacidosis.7–10 β-OHB accounts for 70% of ketone bodies and has been suggested to be beneficial because it not only serves as a vital alternative metabolic fuel source in the fed, fasted, and starved states11, but also exerts antioxidative,12 antiaging,13 and anti-inflammatory effects.14  Although numerous reports have acknowledged the beneficial effects of β-OHB, its safety has been challenged by certain clinical lines of evidence related to its effects on cardiovascular health. For example, the concentration of β-OHB in heart tissues is significantly higher in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).15 In addition, increased circulating β-OHB is independently associated with major adverse cardiovascular events in patients undergoing hemodialysis.",646854fb-5ce1-489e-a89d-48bd1ac9dc2c
2,introduction2,"16 Moreover, diabetes, which is usually associated with high levels of ketone bodies, constitutes an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including AF, coronary heart disease, and stroke.17,18 The potential detrimental effects of β-OHB have also been implicated in clinical studies, in which KD has been practiced. For example, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease of unknown etiology has frequently been described in those in the KD group in various studies.19–21 Moreover, a 25-year follow-up study of a large cohort found that a low-carbohydrate diet was associated with increased mortality,22 although it was not clear whether the KD directly increased the incidence of cardiovascular disease, a major factor that affects life expectancy.23 Taken together, these findings suggest that KD consumption or β-OHB accumulation may increase the risks of cardiovascular disease, suggesting that long-term consumption of a KD should be carefully considered.",8bfa7652-327c-40ee-9233-af340ca12d62

After 16 weeks, besides a decrease in body weight (Supplementary Fig. 1d), fat mass (Supplementary Fig. 1e), and blood pressure (Supplementary Fig. 1f, g) in KD-fed rats, we observed increased heart rates and impaired cardiac function, as evaluated by echocardiography (Table 1). In KD-fed rats, the left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWd) increased significantly compared with normal diet-fed rats, indicating a compensatory increase in cardiomyocytes, used to enhance cardiac contractility (Table 1).

9,results1," The right ventricular anterior wall thickness (right ventricular anterior wall thickness (RVAW)) also increased, indicating increased pulmonary circulation resistance and corresponding thickening of the right ventricular myocardium. Furthermore, the left atrial diameter (left atrial diameter (LAD)), left ventricular dimension in diastole (LVDd), and left ventricular dimension in systole (LVDs) increased in KD-fed rats, indicating that cardiac function was decompensated and entered a state of failure (Table 1).

In accordance with impaired cardiac function, we observed the occurrence of fibrosis in the atrial tissues of KD-fed but not normal diet-fed rats, as analyzed by atrial tissue staining (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). We also detected the expression levels of protein markers of fibrosis using both immunohistochemistry (immunohistochemistry (IHC)) and western blotting.

Some full-length blots are presented in the Supplementary Fig. 13    Because a KD usually provides fewer calories than a carbohydrate-rich diet, we employed caloric restriction (CR) in another group of rats as a control to determine whether KD induced cardiac fibrosis was caused by an insufficient supply of energy. We found CR did not induce cardiac fibrosis and cardiac function impairment in rats (Fig. 1a–c, Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, and Table 1). Moreover, the KD caused increased levels of β-OHB and AcAc, the predominant forms of ketone bodies, in both plasma and heart tissues (Fig. 1d, e).",c0656c83-348e-42d8-a147-4db49f256000
13,results6," In contrast, CR only induced a mild elevation of β-OHB and AcAc (Fig. 1d, e). These observations suggested that a considerable elevation in ketone bodies may account for the onset of cardiac fibrosis in rats.  Increased β-OHB resulted in cardiac fibrosis To further elucidate whether and which ketone bodies induced fibrosis, we increased the levels of either β-OHB or AcAc in rats by intraperitoneal injection (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d) because β-OHB and AcAc were the predominant forms of ketone bodies elevated after KD feeding (Fig. 1d, e). During the 16-week injection period, water intake, daily calorie intake, body weight, fat mass, and blood pressure were not affected by either β-OHB or AcAc injection (Supplementary Fig. 3e–j). We found that increased levels of β-OHB, but not AcAc, resulted in impaired cardiac function, as evidenced by increased left atrial diameter (LAD), LVDs, LVDd, LVPWd, and right ventricular anterior wall thickness (RVAW) in echocardiography analysis (Table 2).",e7771719-896a-43f5-ab96-7a9866039546
14,results7," Furthermore, we observed the occurrence of cardiac fibrosis in β-OHB intraperitoneal injected rats, as evident by atrial staining (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 4a) and analysis of cardiac fibrosis molecular markers, namely type I collagen, type III collagen, and α-SMA (Fig. 1g, h and Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). We also observed that frequent deep fasting (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b) induced high levels of β-OHB (Supplementary Fig. 5c) and molecular phenotypes of cardiac fibrosis, including characteristic fiber staining results (Supplementary Fig. 5d), and expression of collagen and α-SMA (Supplementary Fig. 5e).

16,results10," In cultured human cardiomyocytes (human cardiomyocytes (HCM)), rat cardiomyoblasts (H9C2), and mouse cardiac muscle cells (HL-1), increased levels of β-OHB led to elevated rates of apoptosis; however, β-OHB did not induce significant increases in apoptosis in fibroblasts, such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and 3T3 cells (Fig. 2a). In primary cells isolated from neonatal mice, β-OHB treatment also led to an increase in apoptosis in primary mouse cardiomyocytes, but not in primary mouse cardiac fibroblast (Fig. 2b). In accordance with increased apoptosis, elevated β-OHB led to increases in the levels of cleaved caspase 3 in human cardiomyocytes (HCM) and H9C2 cells, but not in MEFs (Fig. 2c). Moreover, in rat atrial tissue, we confirmed that high β-OHB levels, induced by either KD feeding or β-OHB injection, led to increased rates of apoptosis, as evidenced by in situ TUNEL assays (Fig. 2d) and detection of the levels of cleaved caspase 3 in rat atrial tissue (Fig. 2e).",c5987708-b9f4-480c-856f-b3dc33862224

19,results13," By measuring the expression of proteins within the ketolysis pathway in H9C2, HL-1, and human cardiomyocytes (HCM) cells treated with or without β-OHB, we observed decreased expression of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1) and succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (succinyl CoA 3 ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT)) in β-OHB-treated cells (Fig. 2f), and atrial tissues from KD-fed and β-OHB-injected rats (Fig. 2g), suggesting that increased input of ketone bodies did not enhance ketolysis. We next evaluated the glycolytic and citrate metabolic flux in cultured cell lines and primary cardiomyocytes. Decreased levels of citrate cycle metabolites and increased levels of the glycolytic metabolites pyruvate and lactate were observed in β-OHB-treated cells (Fig. 2h). Together with our results showing that decreased levels of citrate cycle metabolites and increased levels of the glycolytic metabolites were also observed in atrial tissues from rats with high β-OHB levels (Fig.",66f4b7cf-79f4-42db-9746-839d5cf1df36

Accordingly, the apoptosis levels of MEFs and primary cardiac fibroblasts were not altered in response to hypoxia and β-OHB treatments (Supplementary Fig. 7e, f).",14eb93a1-95d6-40e4-9f24-d10e3aa9b790

27,results21," 13    In an attempt to identify genes that were transcriptionally regulated by β-OHB, we evaluated the gene expression profiles of H9C2 cells with or without β-OHB treatment. The results showed that the transcription of Sirt4 and Sirt7 was activated by β-OHB (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Because other markers of mitochondrial biogenesis, such as Polrmt, Tfb1m, and Tfam, were not reduced after β-OHB treatment and because SIRT7 specifically regulates MRPL16, MRPL24, and GFM2,40 we hypothesized that β-OHB blocked mitochondrial activity via SIRT7-mediated transcriptional regulation. In cultured H9C2, HL-1, and human cardiomyocytes (HCM) cells, we confirmed that β-OHB increased SIRT7 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4c, d). Knockdown of SIRT7 increased the transcription of Gfm2 and Mrpl24, and attenuated the inhibitory effects of β-OHB treatment on Gfm2 and Mrpl24 transcription (Fig. 4e).",60bbc8d9-a5cd-44d6-a433-e0655b9998fb
28,results22," Conversely, overexpression of SIRT7 resulted in decreased Gfm2 and Mrpl24 transcription, and saturated the effects of β-OHB treatment (Fig. 4f). Moreover, rats with high levels of β-OHB, including KD-fed and β-OHB-injected rats, exhibited increased cardiac SIRT7 mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 4g, h), as well as decreased Gfm2 and Mrpl24 mRNA levels (Fig. 4g). Furthermore, overexpression of SIRT7 decreased mitochondrion levels, whereas knockdown of SIRT7 slightly increased mitochondrion levels in cultured cells (Fig. 4i, j). Either overexpressing or knocking down SIRT7 in cells attenuated the inhibitory effects of β-OHB treatment (Fig. 4i, j). Double immunofluorescence staining of atrial tissues from β-OHB-injected or normal rats revealed that β-OHB promoted SIRT7 expression and reduced mitochondrial numbers, as indicated by measuring the level of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2); this further indicated that β-OHB impaired mitochondrial biogenesis by activating SIRT7 (Fig. 4k).",712fdc95-52ee-4273-8dca-133202fc0b61
29,results23," Furthermore, although high β-OHB induced SIRT4 overexpression, forced SIRT4 overexpression had no effect on Gfm2 or Mrpl24 expression (Supplementary Fig. 8b). These results collectively confirmed that β-OHB inhibited mitochondrial biogenesis by promoting SIRT7 overexpression.  β-OHB inhibited histone deacetylase 2 and activated Sirt7 transcription We next investigated how β-OHB regulated the transcription of Sirt7. We hypothesized that histone acetylation may play a role, as β-OHB is an established inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), include HDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC4, and HDAC6.12 Knockdown of HDACs individually in β-OHB-treated H9C2 cells revealed that only Hdac2 knockdown increased Sirt7 expression and abrogated the ability of β-OHB to activate Sirt7 transcription (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 9). In turn, overexpression of HDAC2, but not other HDACs, inhibited Sirt7 transcription in H9C2 cells (Fig. 5b), indicating that HDAC2 was the HDAC that regulated Sirt7 transcription.",2bc7a76e-413c-468f-ae0b-08e45bdc16c2
30,results24," Accordingly, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we found that HDAC2 bound to the core promoter region of Sirt7 and localized to the same region as acetylated H3K9 (Fig. 5c). Moreover, the acetylation levels of H3K9 and H3K14 in the promoter of Sirt7 were increased in β-OHB-treated cultured H9C2 cells (Fig. 5d). In addition, we observed increased acetylation levels of H3K9 and H3K14 in the promoter of Sirt7 in the heart tissues of KD-fed and β-OHB-injected rats, when compared with those in the corresponding control rats (Fig. 5e). These results suggested that Sirt7 transcriptional activation was related to alterations in acetylation, which were regulated by the β-OHB/HDAC2 pathway.Fig. 5 β-OHB activated Sirt7 transcription by inhibiting HDAC2. a Sirt7 mRNA levels in Hdac2-knockdown or control H9C2 cells treated with or without β-OHB; n = 3.

Some full-length blots are presented in the Supplementary Fig. 13    Although β-OHB was previously shown to be negatively correlated with cellular HDAC2 activity,41 direct evidence has not yet been obtained to validate whether β-OHB inhibits HDAC2 deacetylase activity. Therefore, we conducted an in vitro deacetylation assay and found that β-OHB had significant inhibitory effects on HDAC2, with an IC50 of 2.4 mM in vitro (Fig. 5f), suggesting that KD-induced elevation of β-OHB in the heart decreased HDAC2 activity by more than half. In cultured cells, we confirmed that β-OHB treatment resulted in increased levels of total histone acetylation (Fig. 5g), particularly of H3K9 and H3K14, downstream targets of HDAC2 (Fig. 5h).",55443b65-55c8-42b9-b9dc-8ce33393f11f
33,results27," Trichostatin A, a general HDAC inhibitor, caused phenotypes similar to those of β-OHB, including activation of Sirt7 transcription (Supplementary Fig. 10a), downregulation of Gfm2 and Mrpl24 expression (Supplementary Fig. 10a), inhibition of mitochondrial biogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 10b), inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 3f, g), and promotion of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2a–c). In addition, we confirmed that the expression of voltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1H (CACNA1H) and voltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-2 delta-2 (CACNA2D2), which are known to be inhibited by HDAC2,42 were increased in β-OHB-treated cells (Fig. 5i) and heart tissues from KD-fed rats (Fig. 5j). Taken together, these results indicated that β-OHB activated Sirt7 transcription by inhibiting HDAC2.",1180f9ba-34a9-4d9c-b311-16562c869e9b
34,results28,"  Increased β-OHB and its consequences were observed in patients with AF In order to confirm the causal role of β-OHB in cardiac fibrosis, we examined cardiac fibrosis, β-OHB levels, and changes in β-OHB-associated markers in patients with AF. First, we found that β-OHB levels in cardiac tissues were 3.3-fold higher in patients with AF than in those with sinus rhythm (SR; Fig. 6a). Second, CACNA1H and CACNA2D2 expression was higher in cardiac tissues from patients with AF, indicating that HDAC2 was inhibited in the cardiac tissues of these patients (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 11a). Third, increased levels of SIRT7 were observed in cardiac tissues from patients with AF compared with those in patients with SR, according to both western blotting (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 11a) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 11b). Fourth, markers of fibrosis, including type I collagen, type III collagen, and α-SMA, were higher in patients with AF (Fig.",bcde1130-e563-49d5-83fc-42b8fc64e6bc

Lastly, the number of mitochondria was significantly lower in cardiac tissues from patients with AF than in those from patients with SR, as indicated by the ratio of mtDNA to nucleic DNA (Fig. 6d). These findings, together with the observation that the cardiac β-OHB concentration was negatively correlated with the number of mitochondria (Fig. 6e), confirmed that elevations in β-OHB were associated with cardiac fibrosis and an increased risk of AF.Fig. 6 Increased β-OHB was associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). a Concentrations of β-OHB and AcAc in atrial tissues from patients with sinus rhythm (SR) and AF. b The left panel shows representative western blotting analysis of SIRT7, CACNA1H, CACNA2D2, GFM2, MRPL24, collagen I, collagen III, and α-SMA in atrial tissues from patients with SR and AF.

37,discussion0,"Some studies have indicated that β-OHB exhibits beneficial effects in the cardiac system under pathological conditions and can, for example, be used as an alternative fuel in the human failing heart.43 Moreover, this compound improves cardiac cell excitation–contraction coupling during hypoxia44 and prevents myocardial damage after coronary occlusion in animal model.45 In this study, we provided evidence and mechanistic explanations from cultured cells, animal models, and clinical samples to show that long-term KD-induced β-OHB accumulation was detrimental to heart health by promoting cardiac fibrosis (Fig. 6f).  Several facts support our findings. First, a KD forces cells in the body to rely primarily on fatty acid β-oxidation rather than glycolysis for energy production, inevitably leading to increased ketone body production, primarily in the liver; this change elevates circulating levels of ketone bodies and exposes cardiomyocytes in the heart to high levels of ketone bodies.",446a34a0-6973-4051-ac0f-cdd87db1737f
38,discussion1," However, although theoretically all cells in the body are exposed to elevated levels of ketone bodies, cardiomyocytes are among those most vulnerable to high ketone body exposure, as high levels of ketone bodies reduce the mitochondrial content significantly, as demonstrated in our study. The mitochondrial content in cardiomyocytes reaches up to 30% of the total cell volume, much higher than that in the cells of other organs, because the heart requires high levels of energy production from the β-oxidation of fatty acids.46 Therefore, although the regulatory effects of β-OHB to mitochondrial content may be present in many organs because of HDAC2 and SIRT7 expression (Supplementary Fig. 12), long-term β-OHB exposure selectively induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes.  In addition, HDAC2, which was found to be inactivated by β-OHB in our study, is essential for promoting heart development and maintaining heart function,47–49 and downregulation of HDAC2 increases apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.",557ff044-dd19-493b-a47a-efa87bbbaf65
39,discussion2,"42 Our in vitro assay showed that β-OHB inhibited HDAC2, with an IC50 of 2.4 mM, which is lower than the β-OHB concentrations observed in the human AF heart and in KD-fed and deep-fasted rats (i.e., ~3–4 mM). These results further supported that consumption of a KD induced the accumulation of β-OHB to pathological levels.  Although the β-OHB/HDAC2/SIRT7–mitochondrial biogenesis–cardiac fibrosis pathway was found in the current study, several questions remained unsolved. First, systematic metabolic remodeling induced by KD is more extensive than β-OHB intraperitoneal injection. For example, KD induced decreased levels of glucose and increased levels of free fatty acid in blood, and increased gluconeogenesis in liver and kidney. In contrast, β-OHB intraperitoneal injection did not cause such glucose/fatty acid metabolic reprogram in rat.",d4297346-eff5-43b4-ba8d-51b7ac3937e3
40,discussion3," Although our studies indicated that increased β-OHB was able to cause cardiac fibrosis in rat, whether the dysregulation of other types of metabolites induced by long-term KD contributes to cardiac fibrosis remains unknown. Secondly, in the current study, we did not examine whether long-term KD or β-OHB injection caused other organ abnormalities. So the safety of long-term effects of KD and β-OHB injection still required further studies. Third, besides SIRT7, HDAC2 has many downstream targets. In the current study, we aimed to confirm that the β-OHB/HDAC2/SIRT7 pathway was important to mitochondrial biogenesis. Therefore, we did not measure other cardiac fetal genes that may be regulated by HDAC2. Further studies are required to reveal regulatory effects of HDAC2 on mitochondrial genes.",9cda3c24-a14f-430e-9e6c-95c83f7bd0a6
41,discussion4," Last, we validated that SIRT7 inhibited mitochondrial biogenesis in cardiomyocytes, consistent with previous findings showing that increased expression or activity of SIRT7 inhibited mitochondrial biogenesis in hematopoietic stem cells and human embryonic kidney cells.40,50 However, SIRT7 deficiency in fibroblasts has been shown to induce mitochondrial dysfunction.51 Thus, these contradictory observations indicated that SIRT7 may exert different regulatory effects on mitochondrial function in different types of cells.  The findings of our current study defined the mechanism underlying the negative health effects of KDs, which are adopted worldwide for therapeutic purposes and have been increasingly preferred by healthy individuals in order to prevent obesity. Our results strongly suggest that unless the adverse effects of a KD on the cardiac system can be effectively avoided, healthy individuals should reconsider the use of a KD for weight loss.
