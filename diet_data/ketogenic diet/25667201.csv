0,methods0,"Ketogenic diet The high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) was prepared by Morawski (Kcynia, Poland) from lard, butter, corn oil, casein, wheat bran, a mineral mix, a vitamin mix and dextrose. The nutritional profile of the diet was: fat 79%, protein 9.5%, carbohydrates 0.8%, fiber 5%, vitamins and minerals 5.7%. The diet was prepared according to the BioServ F3666 Ketogenic Diet (Frenchtown, NJ, USA) recipe, and was modified by the replacement of cellulose with wheat bran. This modification was introduced due to the results of the preliminary study (see below in Results section). The standard fodder was taken from the same supplier (see also Supplementary Information).",d1322356-0da8-4555-bf57-891fd1faa692

The Eker rat (Long Evans Tsc2+/−) husbandry was derived from Robert Waltereit, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany. The animals were inbred and their genotypes were determined by PCR22. As a result, 93 adult (52 males and 41 females) Eker rats were divided into three ketogenic and one control group: [1] KD4, where 16 animals (9 males and 7 females) were treated with high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) from 10 mo. of age for the next four months; [2] KD6, where 26 animals (15 males and 11 females) were treated with high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) from 8 mo.",758a7fa4-71a0-4816-98e9-1640b4a0c462

Additionally, six wild-type Long Evans rats were used for protein measurements conducted by Western Blotting. Three of them were maintained on the standard diet (LE ST) and the remaining on an high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) similarly to the KD6 group (LE KD). All the animals were anesthetized (i.p. injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine plus 10 mg/kg xylazine) and sacrificed at the age of 14 mo. by a transcardiac perfusion with 200 mL of Tris-Buffered Saline (Tris Buffered Saline (TBS)) (pH 7.4, 4 °C) followed by 200 mL of 10% formalin in TB (pH 7.4, 4 °C).

Tumor assessment For the evaluation of the renal tumor size, visible solid tumors with a diameter >2 mm were measured with a digital caliper. The length and width of the lesion were measured and calculated by the formula: tumor volume = 3.14/6 × a2 × b, where “a” is the shorter and “b” is the longer axis of the tumor23. The gross tumor volume has been expressed as a mean of the tumor volume per group and a sum of all tumor volumes per animal. To confirm the data obtained from the macroscopic evaluation, sets of 2 mm interval sections from KD6 and ST groups (Rat Kidney Slicers, Zivic Instruments, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) were prepared as H&E-stained paraffin 5 micrometer sections.",bf44ad4e-6e75-4487-873d-f5162ebe9e7b
4,methods4," These sections were photographed (63× magnification, Wild M400, ProMicron, Kirchheim, Germany) to obtain high-resolution images (5184 × 3456 pixels) and each tumor or cyst identified was measured using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) to determine its length and width, as well as the percent of the lumen filled by tumor (this was 0% for a simple cyst, and 100% for a completely filled, solid adenocarcinoma). These measurements were converted into the tumor volume per lesion using the following formula: Tumor volume = maximum(tumor percent, 5)/100 * 3.14159/6 * 1.64 * (tumor length * tumor width)^1.5. The total tumor volume per animal was then equal to the sum of the tumor volumes of each lesion identified24. A microscopic evaluation was not conducted in one rat from the KD6 group, where the kidneys were extremely overgrown by tumor.",97ecbf6a-1ccb-485c-99ab-07fa323f53a6
5,methods5,"  Blood serum analyses On the day of euthanasia, 1 mL of orbital sinus blood was collected 2 h after the lights were turned on, because growth hormone peaks are expected to occur especially during the first hours of the inactive period25. The blood was allowed to clot by leaving it for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then centrifuged (2,000× g for 15 minutes), and the serum was collected and stored at −80 °C. The serum level of β-hydroxybutyrate was measured using a β-Hydroxybutyrate Assay Kit (BioVision, Milpitas, CA, USA). The serum levels of the insulin (Rat Insulin ELISA, Demeditec diagnostics GmbH, Germany), the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1; Quantikine ELISA Mouse/Rat IGF-1, R&D System, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and the growth hormone (Rat/Mouse GH, Millipore, St. Charles, MO, USA) were measured according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",20486938-4991-47c8-89c1-96cdef60e87b

A visual qualitative observation (using BX51 microscope with U-TV-1X-2 camera and CellˆB image acquisition software, all from Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was used to determine the signal intensity in the tumor tissue relative to the normal tissue.  Immunoblotting The protein level in the renal tissue was estimated by means of Western Blotting. Basing on the immunohistochemistry results, we analyzed the presence of p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Thr204; #9101, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) and p-mTOR (Ser2448; #2971, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) to verify the activity of these proteins in the kidneys.",75ceb9bb-b9d1-46c3-996d-b9e780ee7fb3

The results were normalized to the β-actin reference protein (#4970, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) (see also Supplementary Information).  Metabolite profiling To complete the comprehensive analysis of the high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) actions, we performed gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) – based profiling of metabolites present in rat kidney tissue extracts. Each tissue sample was processed and analyzed separately in at least three biological repetition for each animal group. Freshly frozen renal samples were extracted with mixtures of water and methanol, then methylene chloride and methanol as described previously26.",6f7d2128-bc23-45a4-9fec-b7fe6117aaed

The obtained metabolomic data was analyzed to evaluate an influence of long-term feeding by high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) on the renal metabolome changes. ,901d70cc-b994-460d-b530-5e4e27ba21d2
10,analysis0,"Statistica 10 (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. Macroscopic tumor sizes and the serum levels of triglycerides, insulin and IGF-1 were tested using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. For comparison of the microscopic tumor volumes between the two analyzed groups (KD6 and ST) the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test was applied. Non-parametric data was presented as medians and 5–95 percentiles (enclosed in square brackets). All other data with a normal distribution was analyzed with ANOVA and presented as mean ± S.E.M.  In the metabolomic profiling, the data was filtered to only feature metabolites that showed up in at least 100% of the samples in each of the groups.

The P-values for each group’s normality testing, homoscedasticity testing, ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis testing had the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction applied. After the FDR correction, the final test was chosen after assessing the normality and homoscedasticity of each metabolite’s data across the groups: if at least one of the groups was identified as not normal, or the Bartlett’s test P-value was significant, the Kruskal-Wallis was chosen as the test for the metabolite; otherwise, ANOVA was used as the test for the metabolite.  If the final chosen test P-value was significant (with a significance threshold of 0.05), post-hoc testing was also performed to identify between which groups the values were significantly different. In the case of ANOVA, the Fisher (Western Blotting data), Dunnett’s (ELISA’s parametric data) or Tukey test were used.",0c00abf6-1612-4db5-a327-ecabe56b5b8f

13,results0,"The ketogenic properties of modified high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) Considering the fact that prolonged nourishment on high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) may influence tumor development, we aimed to perform a long-term study. During preliminary experiments, we observed total growth inhibition and emaciation in rats being fed with the original high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) for longer than 2 months. Besides these strong side-effects, a high mortality rate was noted after 4 months of treatment (data not shown). To overcome this issue, we elaborated a modification of classical high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD). The debilitating effects were not observed after the replacement of cellulose with wheat bran. Blood ketones and glucose levels were examined in order to demonstrate the ketosis induced by the modified high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD).",22f3a553-34d1-41cf-b6ca-1b5ba4996b19

Although there was an abundant fat supply, the median blood triglycerides were unchanged between the groups (ST, 1 mM [0.6–4.8]; KD4, 1mM [0.7–4.7]; KD6 1.1 mM [0.6–5.4]; KD8, 1 mM [0.6–5.7]; Fig. 1C).  Long-term treatment with high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) increases renal tumor growth in Eker rats At the age of 10, 8 and 6 mo. a rat standard fodder was replaced with high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) – for 4, 6 and 8 months, respectively.",ba2c03dd-a5d4-4e8a-9d6e-24beeb58cc55
15,results2," We did not observe any influence of high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) on tumor size between the KD4, KD6 and ST groups, where the median tumor volume was 568 [5–7084], 206 [5–22268] and 188 [7–3572] mm3, respectively (Fig. 2A). However, sustained treatment with high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) led to an excessive growth of tumors in the KD8 group when compared to the control group (p = 0.018), with a median volume of 2377 [148–67256] mm3 (Fig. 2A). The incidence of tumors with a diameter >2 mm was higher in the groups where the rats were fed with high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) (53% in KD4, 65% in KD6 and 84% in KD8) when compared with the control animals (48%). The results of a microscopic analysis of all lesions confirmed a lack of a differences between ST and KD6 groups with a median total tumor volume of 99 [0.01–6488] and 137 [1–3795] mm3, respectively (p = 0.55, Fig. 2B).",07bff338-c30a-4d93-b5dc-daac82f6572d
16,results3," The incidence of all renal lesions was 92% in KD6 and 80% in the ST group.  Tumors from the KD8 group often showed a malignant phenotype by extending to adjacent organs (see also Supplementary Information Fig. S1). Within the other groups, a similar observation was made only in one female from the KD6 group. Although we did not find any significant differences of median tumor volume per animal between the KD4 and KD6 groups, we noticed an exponential growth of mean tumor volume per group within the ketogenic groups (R2 = 0.97, Fig. 2C). There were no differences between genders in all of these parameters.  high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) caused a drop in plasma insulin but a rise of growth hormone secretion, whereas concentrations of IGF-1 varied with the time of treatment To gain some insight into how prolonged feeding with high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) promotes tumor growth, we measured the plasma insulin, IGF-1 and growth hormone levels.",5ec47b5a-551b-41a5-adb9-eb722a17c99a
17,results4," Median plasma insulin was reduced in the KD6 (0.28 [0.3–0.5] ng/ml, p = 0.001) and KD8 (0.27 [0.3–0.5] ng/ml, p = 0.0003) but not in KD4 (0.42 [0.3–0.5] ng/ml) groups, in comparison to the control group (0.44 [0.4–0.7] ng/ml) (Fig. 3A). The insulin drop might be due to an antagonistic action of the growth hormone27, whose mean concentration was elevated in the rats treated with high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) (KD4, 5.3 ± 1.3 ng/ml; KD6, 9 ± 1.3 ng/ml, p = 0.004; KD8, 9.5 ± 2.9 ng/ml, p = 0.02; Fig. 3B) as compared to control (ST, 3.2 ± 0.5 ng/ml). This was probably associated with the ability of high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) to imitate the starvation state, in which growth hormone is the sole oversecreted anabolic hormone28. Furthermore, we observed changes in the concentrations of IGF-1. Initially, after four months of treatment, median IGF-1 level has declined (123 [36–243] ng/ml, p = 0.",c9d5307c-b6a7-488b-a825-8b5881ff31f7
18,results5,"005) as compared to control (249 [150–440] ng/ml), which is in line with reports demonstrating that high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) induces growth hormone resistance in the liver29. After six and eight months, the median IGF-1 concentrations returned to their normal values (240 [150–435] ng/ml in KD6 and 226 [139–476] ng/ml in KD8; p = 0.004 and p = 0.02 as compared to KD4, respectively; Fig. 3C). Such fluctuations in IGF-1 levels may be explained by the increased release of growth hormone observed in the KD6 and KD8 groups. However, an abundant release of growth hormone did not induce a proportional oversecretion of hepatic IGF-1, whose levels came back to their control values. This indicates sustained, but not total, liver resistance to the GH. Moreover, the growth hormone levels were positively correlated with tumor size within the high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD)-treated groups (r = 0.69, p < 0.",574f8740-7afd-4206-a9b8-75040bc5ebbf
19,results6,"001), which indicates an additional influence of high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) on renal tumorigenesis. There were no between-sex differences in plasma levels of the examined peptides.  high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) activates ERK1/2 and mTOR kinases in the kidneys of Eker rats, leading to extensive growth of MAPK- and mTOR- dependent tumors It is well known that the MAPK pathway is implicated in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-related tumor growth30. Accordingly, by immunohistochemical techniques, we also observed hyperactivation of ERK1/2 in the Eker rat renal tumors (Fig. 4A–C). Moreover, we performed examinations of these proteins by Western Blotting in the renal cortex (Fig. 5A). The results showed that the MAPK pathway was highly activated in the renal tissue of high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD)-treated rats from the KD6 (p = 0.004) and KD8 (p = 0.006) groups (Fig. 5B).",2166d305-73c6-48db-a7db-3537d24ed8d5
20,results7,"  Immunohistochemical labeling of phosphorylated mTOR in the kidneys revealed hyperactivation of this kinase within lesions (Fig. 4D–F). Subsequent immunoblotting analysis of renal tissue showed higher mTOR phosphorylation in the KD6 (p = 0.011) and KD8 (p = 0.027) groups (Fig. 5C).  high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) may prevent early tumor growth by the induction of adaptive mechanisms related to Nrf2, p53 and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase α up-regulation It was interesting that the pro-tumorigenic properties of high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) were revealed only after a prolonged application of this diet. To gain insight into the mechanisms for this effect, we evaluated the possible anticancer actions of high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) by measuring the p53, 8-oxoguanine glycosylase α and Nrf2 levels in kidney homogenates (Fig. 6A).",9a47d751-8c01-4b6d-88ed-5d5c77c8715f
21,results8," Immunoblotting data revealed that the concentration of total p53 had been increasing with the duration of the high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) treatment (p = 0.025 KD4 vs. ST), reaching a peak in the KD6 (p = 0.0007) group (Fig.6B). In the KD8 group, p53 levels had declined (p = 0.025 vs. KD6) but still remained higher in comparison to the control group (p = 0.032).  It is well known that ketogenic diets favor the tricarboxylic acid (tricarboxylic acid (TCA)) cycle, where ketone bodies and fats are intensively burned leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)14. It has been shown that high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) induces ROS overproduction, which in turn stimulates up-regulation of the Nrf2 transcription factor31. Our analysis confirmed this data by showing that in rats fed by high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD), the level of Nrf2 was increased (p = 0.019, p = 0.016 and p = 0.",4c261d3d-3829-481d-b6a2-43e5599899ef
22,results9,"009 for KD4, KD6 and KD8 groups, respectively as compared to ST, Fig.6C).  P53 modulates 8-oxoguanine glycosylase α activity in different ways32. Impaired function of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase α plays a major role in renal tumorigenesis in the Eker rats33. An immature form of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase α (39 kDa) is cleaved to become the active protein (38 kDa) which plays a role in the conversion of oxidized guanine (8-oxoguanine) back to guanine, to avoid mutations34. In the ketogenic groups, only the active form of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase α was detected (Fig. 6D). Moreover, the level of mature 8-oxoguanine glycosylase α was elevated in the kidney lysates from the KD4 (p = 0.008) and KD6 (p = 0.046) groups, but not in KD8 (p = 0.008 for KD8 vs. KD4 and p = 0.028 for KD8 vs. KD6 Fig. 6D).",2705126f-6ee8-491b-b14e-b3b833044d09
23,results10,"  The antitumor properties of the high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD), observed at the initial period of the treatment, were seen both on the molecular (Western blot analysis) and systemic (tumor size evaluation) levels. Initially, the high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) launches adaptive molecular mechanisms marked here by upregulation of some protective proteins such as Nrf2, p53 and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase α. During this time renal tumor size did not differ significantly between high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) (KD4 and KD6) groups and control. Tumor growth became obvious at the later period (in KD8 group) when the adaptive mechanisms were exhausted, which was accompanied by ERK and mTOR upregulation.",1867bce2-c2cb-48cf-9261-054014aa4c99
24,results11,"  high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) increases the renal oleic acid level and affects the amino acid pool of renal tissue In order to reveal the pro-tumorigenic effects of other variables arising from the prolonged high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) treatment, GC/MS-based profiling of the metabolites from the rats’ kidney tissue extracts was performed. This approach allowed for the identification of many metabolites most of which were assigned to the following clusters: amino acids, carboxylic acids, fatty acids esters, fatty acids, nucleosides, saccharides, sterols, sugar alcohols and others. The obtained data revealed that using the high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) for 4, 6 and 8 mo. altered metabolome composition (Fig. 7). However, significant differences were noticed only for some metabolites (Table 1). We observed an increased accumulation of oleic acid in rats treated with high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD).",d286e98e-e679-42cd-a536-fb8ce8528445
25,results12," It should be also emphasized that 5 other metabolites: guanosine, D-glucuronic acid, glyceric acid, scyllo-inositol and succinic acid significantly differed between the groups (Table 1). We have also performed an additional analysis between all metabolite clusters by comparing relative levels (mean value for each metabolite related to the corresponding mean value in the control group) of all metabolites within a cluster between KD4, KD6 and KD8. As a result, we have observed a statistical difference only between amino acids clusters. The amino acid pool was significantly lower in KD8 as compared to KD4 and KD6 (p < 0.001 for both, ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test, Fig. 7). ",e2321888-ff0e-4a34-8816-4776b83fab5c
26,discussion0,"high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) is a well appreciated anti-seizure therapy for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), but it has not been clearly established how it may affect the tumor growth related to this disorder. In a case series the high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) was not sufficiently protective against progression of tumors and was not seen to induce tumor regression in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)35. Herein, we have shown for the first time that high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) promotes renal tumor growth in a rat model of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). We designed our experiment to reveal the long-term effects of unrestricted high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) on tumorigenesis and to discriminate its pro-tumorigenic properties.",e6beb5c9-b743-4336-a168-fed1b2a32d7a
27,discussion1," In contrast to our results, some previous investigations conducted on animal models with tumor xenografts showed that high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) suppressed the development of tumors. high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD), with caloric restrictions, has been shown to reduce glioma development in mice36. However, its administration in an ad libitum manner did not reveal these antitumor properties373839. Similarly, the Freedland team released a series of reports showing that long-term treatment with unrestricted high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) (for 2–3 months) did not affect the xenograft prostate cancer growth in mice404142.",d5330ac5-e29c-48b3-b2c4-0396cc166ce9
28,discussion2," Therefore, it is probable that the observed antitumor effect depended mostly on the calorie restriction associated with high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD), but not on the diet itself, especially given that such antitumor properties of calorie restriction have been well documented in other animal cancer models43.  However, some reports from animal models with injected cancer cells have also shown that unrestricted high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) delayed tumor growth44454647. These investigations were performed on specialized cancer cell lines which had acquired many mutations, and it is probable that in these cells, the metabolism strongly depended on the Warburg effect. Poff et al. showed that high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) suppressed the growth of CT-2A cells44 which had impaired mitochondrial metabolism and depended mainly on glycolysis48. Furthermore, Otto et al.",a388fb9a-997f-4493-b46f-716399015c47
29,discussion3," showed a decrease of 23132/87 adenocarcinoma in mice subjected to unrestricted high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD)45. This cell line carries many mutations, among others c-myc hyperactivity49, which stimulates aerobic glycolysis50. Similarly, Stafford et al.46 and Abdelwahab et al.47 investigated GL-261 cells which also exhibited c-myc hyperactivity51. So, in all of these cases of glycolysis-dependent tumors, the carbohydrate restriction that occurs under high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) may be responsible for the observed inhibition of growth.  Considering all of the above, it is possible that the antitumor effects of high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) depend mainly on the accompanying calorie restrictions, and in the case of glycolysis-dependent neoplasms, the limitation of carbohydrates is sufficient for the inhibition of tumor growth.",6e65269a-5500-4af9-b807-20ba16f09e2b
30,discussion4," Such an assumption is confirmed by the results of this study, where the size of naturally occurring tumors did not differ between the animals fed with a standard fodder or with unrestricted high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) for the periods of 4 and 6 months. However, after 8 mo. of high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) feeding, we observed an increased development of renal tumors. Additionally, in the abovementioned studies, high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) was used in the animals for no longer than 3 mo. Taking into account our results, the prolonged feeding with high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) may not only have no antitumor properties, but can even lead to tumor growth.  We have also shed some light on the mechanisms launched by high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD), which may be implicated in tumor physiology.",b511ac65-746c-45df-9bcf-71aa325a3eda
31,discussion5," We hypothesized that the up-regulation of ERK1/2 could be connected with an increased supply of triglycerides in the ketogenic groups. We didn’t notice an elevation of blood triglycerides in the high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD)-treated animals, but we observed an accumulation of oleic acid in the kidneys. There was a significant increase in the renal oleic acid levels within all the ketogenic groups. It has been shown that oleic acid induces ERK1/2 activation52 leading to cancer progression, and can stimulate the growth of renal carcinoma cells53, which supports our hypothesis about the pro-tumorigenic effects of high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD). Likewise, it has been shown that the growth hormone activates the MAPK pathway, thus its overproduction in the ketogenic groups may also boost ERK1/2 phosphorylation5455.",e50e3da4-92d1-4efe-8b8a-f7cb6378d8b9
32,discussion6," We believe that high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) induced the ERK1/2 activation results as a cumulative effect of the renal oleic acid accumulation and the systemic growth hormone overproduction. Additionally, we observed hyperactivation of mTOR kinase in the high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) treated groups, which also may stimulate growth of mTOR dependent tumors in Eker rats. It is possible that mTOR was stimulated by ERK1/256.  Although the amount of most metabolites fluctuated between the groups, only some substances exhibited significant changes. Unfortunately, in line with current knowledge, we are not able to clearly explain such fluctuations. In particular, the decline in the levels of succinic acid in the KD4 and KD6 groups should be discussed because of its implication in cancerogenesis57. Its drop within these groups may be a result of an intensive tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle turnover, as a consequence of high ketone bodies utilization.",95b0bd14-c061-4013-8225-0df9b60071e3
33,discussion7," However, succinate fluctuations may be also related to other processes, because another tricarboxylic acid (TCA) intermediate – malic acid – has not exhibited a quantitative difference.  Furthermore, the comparison of metabolite clusters revealed a lower level of amino acids in the KD8 group. It is well known that the progression of cancer is accompanied by impaired protein metabolism, with one of the causes being an increased utilization of amino acids to form glucose58. This process may be particularly enhanced under prolonged high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD)-induced carbohydrate depletion. Additionally, amino acids are susceptible to oxidation, resulting in the degradation to distinct products59. The amino acid levels in KD8 might also decrease due to the chronic elevation of oxidative stress, as a consequence of prolonged treatment with high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD).",e6831dc1-78a4-4c7f-837e-5a55b59a23ec
34,discussion8," It appears that the change of the amino acid pool observed in KD8, when compared to the KD4 and KD6 groups, corresponds well to the time dependent protumorigenic properties of high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD).  In parallel, we observed that high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) stimulates protective mechanisms against cancer by the stimulation of p53, Nfr2 and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase α. P53 functions as a tumor suppressor through regulating the cell cycle and promoting apoptosis in order to prevent the accumulation of genome mutations. Additionally, p53 and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase α proteins participate in DNA repairing, and a higher level of these proteins prevents normal cells from the expression of a mutator phenotype60.",3fccff13-6d20-41d3-84cc-ba40640d2089
35,discussion9," 8-oxoguanine glycosylase α is activated in response to oxidative stress; thus, high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD)-induced ROS overproduction (marked by Nrf2) can explain the higher levels of the 8-oxoguanine glycosylase α mature form in the ketogenic groups. This process may be enhanced by interaction with p5332. Taking all of the above into consideration, it seems that high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD)-induced stress stimulates DNA-reparative mechanisms, which are responsible for the anti-cancer properties of this diet. Lower levels of p53 and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase α in the KD8 group, in comparison to the shorter times of high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) treatment, may be the reason for the loss of the anti-tumorigenic properties of high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) under prolonged treatment.",9c034638-9475-41b9-9198-c90d78b52543
36,discussion10,"  Our study shows that long-term feeding by high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) results in a higher incidence, as well as a bigger size, of renal tumors in Eker rats. high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) simultaneously launches opposite mechanisms: pro-tumorigenic and anti-cancerous. The first one is progressive during the time of the high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) application, and depends on up-regulation of intracellular anabolic pathways. This leads to the development of mTOR and MAPK-dependent tumors found in the kidneys of Eker rats. The second is an anti-cancerous mechanism associated with high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) – induced intracellular stress and leads to an adaptive response which may provide protection against neoplastic transformations.",ce440982-7d15-4907-88a0-2fe2e3c3c61c
37,discussion11," The anti-cancerous mechanism is protective at some initial period, but it fails with the increased duration of high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (HFKD) usage, uncovering the pro-tumorigenic hallmarks of this diet.
