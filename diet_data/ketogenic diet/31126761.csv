0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design and Population This was a 90-day, single-center, observational prospective study, enrolling patients with a diagnosis of obesity and Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among those accessing the Center of High Specialization for the Care of Obesity, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy. The inclusion criteria were as follows: Age between 18 and 60 years; body mass index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) above 30 kg/m2; stable body weight (BW) in the preceding 3 months; positive baseline screening for fatty liver based on hepatic steatosis index (HSI) > 36. If the patients were diabetic, only treatment with stable doses of metformin were accepted, and those on other medications or uncontrolled T2D were not enrolled.",027336d1-4556-48f3-9e44-65a8f2ff633b
1,methods1," Exclusion criteria included: Hypersensitivity to components used in the protocol products; renal, cardiac, hepatic severe diseases; psychiatric disturbances; type 1 diabetes; previous bariatric surgery interventions; pregnancy or breastfeeding; lack of informed consent.  2.2. Dietary Intervention All patients underwent a 90-day dietary intervention consisting of a first phase, lasting 45 days, during which they consumed a Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) with meal replacements (New Penta s.r.l., Cuneo, Italy), followed by a 45-day second phase where a hypocaloric diet with meal replacements and gradual reintroduction of carbohydrates (low-calorie diet, low carbohydrate diet (LCD)) was followed. Participants received nutritional counseling at baseline and every two weeks up to 3 months, and they were encouraged to exercise for 30 min at least 3 times weekly, although no formal exercise program or incentives were provided.",a9fae02c-5a6f-4dc0-98c4-a8ef13fbe1bc
2,methods2,"  The Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) consisted of the consumption of 5 meal replacements daily and one serving of vegetables with a low glycemic index at lunch and dinner, for a total of approximately 800 kcal/day, with the following macronutrient composition: Carbohydrates 26 g (14%), protein 1–1.5 g/Kg ideal body weight (46%), fat 35 g (40%).  The low carbohydrate diet (LCD) consisted of the consumption of 6 meal replacements daily and one serving of vegetables with a low glycemic index at lunch and dinner with a gradual reintroduction of carbohydrates (up to 120 g/day), protein intake maintained at 1–1.5 g/Kg ideal body weight, reaching an average calorie intake of 1150 kcal/day by the end of the intervention.   Meal replacements were composed of whey and vegetable protein derived from soya, green peas or cereals.",0068091a-6223-4e76-b9a5-b93e6685f607
3,methods3," The Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)), an index describing the protein value in human nutrition, was calculated for the utilized meal replacements to be 0.9 [48].  The dietary fat component mainly came from extra-virgin olive oil, of which the polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) proportion was <10%, the monounsaturated fatty acid (monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)) was 10–20%, and the saturated fats was <5%. The amount of daily fiber intake was about 27 g/day, mostly deriving from the vegetable servings.  A minimum daily fluid intake of 2 L was recommended, and supplements containing vitamins, minerals and omega-3 fatty acids were provided in accordance with international recommendations relative to dietary interventions composed of meal replacements [49].",99e8d530-8739-4080-81c5-6e966de562b0
4,methods4," The calculated potential renal acid load of the dietary intervention was approximately −6448 mEq/day taking into account the protein containing meal replacements, the recommended vegetable servings, and the provided supplements [50].  2.3. Anthropometric Assessment Anthropometric parameters were measured at baseline and every two weeks thereafter. Body weight was measured using a balance-beam scale (Seca GmbH & Co, Hamburg, Germany). Height was rounded to the closest 0.5 cm. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by squared height in meters (kg/m2). Waist circumference was measured midway between the lower rib and the iliac crest, hip circumference at the level of the widest circumference over the great trochanters to the closest 1.0 cm. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured using an automated digital device.  2.4.",6a395618-d467-455e-9684-855334720b5c
5,methods5," Body Composition Assessment Body composition was measured through dual-energy-X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)) (Hologic 4500, Bedford, MA, USA) at baseline and at the end of both dietary steps, as previously reported [51]. The abdominal visceral adipose tissue (visceral adipose tissue (VAT)) cross-sectional area (cm2) measurement on the whole-body scan was semiautomated, with the Hologic-developed software locating the outer and inner margins of the abdominal wall on both sides of the dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) image in a 5 cm high region of interest (region of interest (ROI)), the bottom edge, 1 cm above the iliac crest. Total fat mass within the abdominal wall was automatically measured, and the amount of subcutaneous fat between the skin line and the outer abdominal wall was subtracted from the total fat area to obtain the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area.",4a82b425-a767-4580-8a6b-b5981f94dbe3
6,methods6," Estimated visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass (g) was then automatically calculated by the software, based on the area and fat weight [52].  2.5. Blood and Urine Chemistry Full blood count, electrolytes, glucose, insulin, HbA1C, lipid profile (triglycerides, total, HDL and LDL cholesterol), total protein, C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)), plasma creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (blood urea nitrogen (BUN)), alanine transferase (alanine transferase (ALT)), aspartate transaminase (aspartate transaminase (AST)), uric acid and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were determined at baseline and at the end of both dietary steps. The hepatic steatosis index (hepatic steatosis index (HSI)) was calculated according to Lee et al., 2010 [20]. FGF21 serum levels were measured after an overnight fast using a commercial ELISA assay kit (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA).",172e9bea-7e7e-47c0-abc6-0f4dece6f18c
7,methods7," Insulin resistance was determined through HOMA-IR calculation [53]. Semi-quantitative determination of acetoacetic acid was measured in the first morning urine at baseline and every other week until the end of the study (Ketur-Test, Accu-Chek, Roche Diagnostics, Rome, Italy).  2.6. Data Management and Statistical Methods Statistical analysis was carried out with the statistical package SPSS 25.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Variables were tested for normality of distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Data are expressed as mean values ± SD (normally distributed variables) and as median values and range (non-normally distributed variables). Variables were log-transformed when non-normally distributed. Comparisons of different time-points were evaluated using mixed-effect analysis, and Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests were used as appropriate.",d254d933-8537-4947-871e-31dc1141e3f2
8,methods8," Stepwise regression modeling was used to determine predictors of percentile changes of hepatic steatosis index (HSI) at different time points, after checking linear regression assumptions. The R-squared coefficient was used to describe the goodness of fit of the regressions. An α error of 0.05 was considered the threshold for statistical significance. The mean ± SD hepatic steatosis index (HSI) we observed in the population with obesity accessing our clinical center was 43 ± 16. Assuming a power of 0.80 and alpha of 0.05, 55 patients were considered appropriate to highlight a clinically relevant reduction of 15% in the hepatic steatosis index (HSI) value, leading to reach below the cut-off of 36. Foreseeing a dropout rate of approximately 20%, 65 patients were enrolled.  2.7. Ethical Aspects The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Sapienza University of Rome (rif.",e155c376-2f5e-47b5-9a17-a017523f0549

All patients were informed about the possible risks and benefits of the proposed interventions and provided written consent.  3. Results 3.1. Clinical Features 65 participants (23 M, 42 F) were enrolled, with a mean age of 51 ± 11.2 years, whose baseline characteristics, together with changes over time, are reported in Table 1. Briefly, 51 of 65 patients had IR, 14 of 65 patients were diagnosed with T2D and were on stable doses of metformin. Twenty-two patients were taking antihypertensive agents, 11 were dyslipidemic and were being treated with statins, 26 patients were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (MS) according to NCEP ATP III diagnostic criteria [54]. By the end of the study, 8 patients reduced the doses or stopped metformin, 12 reduced or stopped the antihypertensive therapy; 5 discontinued the lipid-lowering therapy.",f239099b-c5f1-4857-b875-a11c27ba095c
10,methods10," Before the end of the study, 20 patients dropped-out: 3 during the Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) phase, and 17 in the subsequent low carbohydrate diet (LCD) phase. No significant adverse event was recorded.  3.2. Change in Body Mass and Composition At the end of the study, body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI) and other anthropometric parameters were improved, with major changes occurring during the Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD)-phase. The average weight loss was −8.6% ± 2.5 after the first step and −12.5% ± 3.7 at the end of the study (Table 1; Figure 1A). Moreover, body composition underwent an overall improvement, with a significant decrease in total fat and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) along the study. A small but statistically significant decrease in lean mass was also observed, consistent with previous studies [29]. However, the percentage of lean body mass relatively increased, together with a reduction in the percentage of fat along the study (Table 1).  3.",8a01b9f8-dbec-4282-9af4-c22ea895282f
11,methods11,"3. Change in Biochemical Parameters Both glucose (fasting insulin and glucose, HOMA IR, HbA1c%) and lipid metabolism profiles (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides) were significantly improved by the end of the study, with the first phase characterized by the greatest change (Table 1, Figure 1B–E). Conversely, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as well as inflammatory parameters, did not undergo any significant change along the study period (Table 1). Urinary acetoacetic acid, reflecting ketosis, increased significantly from baseline to the end of Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD), and returned to zero by the end of the low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-program (data not shown).  Baseline circulating FGF21 was 180.1 ± 89.9 ng/mL, with no difference between M and F, T2D and IR, MS and non-MS, dyslipidemic and non-dyslipidemic, hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients (data not shown). Serum FGF21 was positively correlated with diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.",41c9e65b-869c-42e5-896a-fcc6cdc70d4a
12,methods12,"012), fasting insulin (p = 0.004), HOMA-IR (p = 0.006), and alanine transferase (ALT) (p = 0.02), confirming its association with conditions of metabolic disruption, whereas no correlation was found with anthropometric and adiposity markers (Table 2). FGF21 serum level decreased significantly from baseline to the end of the study (p = 0.0001). Post-hoc analysis confirmed a significant decrease during the Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) step (p = 0.02); a decreasing trend during the low carbohydrate diet (LCD) step was also observed (p = 0.07) (Table 1, Figure 1F).  3.4. Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Improvement and Its Predictors hepatic steatosis index (HSI) significantly decreased throughout the study (p < 0.0001) suggesting a major reduction in liver fat content, with a smaller drop during the Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) phase compared to the following low carbohydrate diet (LCD) ((p = 0.02 and p < 0.0001, respectively) Table 1, Figure 1G)).",2f28d3d6-5824-40aa-ad80-542288c79a33
13,methods13," After the Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) step, hepatic steatosis index (HSI) decreased by −6.4 ± 5.7%, whereas a −24.1 ± 7% decrease was observed at the end of the low carbohydrate diet (LCD) step compared to baseline (Figure 1). Interestingly, liver function tests followed a similar pattern, with both alanine transferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) being significantly reduced only after the low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-phase (p < 0.0001, Figure 1H; p = 0.008, Figure 1I, respectively). At baseline, all patients had an hepatic steatosis index (HSI) over 36, which is strongly suggestive for Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [20]. After the Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) step, 93.5% still had an hepatic steatosis index (HSI) over 36. After the low carbohydrate diet (LCD) step only 20% (9/45) of those completing the study had an hepatic steatosis index (HSI) over 36, with 57.",5c18f264-b176-4db5-adcc-3390407e0d58
14,methods14,"8% (26/45) having one between 30 and 36, and 20% (9/45) having a value below 30, a cut off under which Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is ruled out with a sensitivity of 93.1% [20].  A stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed in order to elucidate the independent predictors of the percentile changes of hepatic steatosis index (HSI) from baseline to the end of the Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) step and from baseline to the end of the study. Following the identification of possible independent predictors based on Pearson correlations (variables showing a significant association with hepatic steatosis index (HSI) percentile change (p value ≤ 0.05), we included baseline HOMA-IR, FGF21, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) as independent variables. HOMA-IR was the only predictor of hepatic steatosis index (HSI) percentage change throughout the Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD), step (p = 0009, R = 0.",b3b06f0c-3a4a-4e1d-bea3-7330e605a27b
15,methods15,"414; Table 3A), whereas baseline serum FGF21 concentration was the only predictor of the hepatic steatosis index (HSI) change recorded at the end of the study (p = 0.04, R = −0.364; Table 3B).  4. Discussion We herein confirm that a multistep Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD)-low carbohydrate diet (LCD) dietary approach characterized by meal replacements is safe and effective in reducing body fat and weight, with an improvement in both Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and IR markers [27,33,55]. Our results are in line with those reporting a correlation between circulating FGF21 and metabolic disruption in human subjects. As expected, the Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) phase induced a more pronounced reduction of the HOMA-IR, total cholesterol and triglycerides, likely driven by a rapid and significant weight and fat loss, compared to the low carbohydrate diet (LCD) phase.",1330a2ca-1324-4eee-ab24-2858c5b9b7d4
16,methods16," In addition, many patients reduced or stopped taking antihypertensives, lipid- and glucose-lowering drugs throughout the study as necessary, further confirming the magnitude of the metabolic improvement obtained. The difference in carbohydrate content could have played a role, but the study design did not allow for further clarification. As reported by Rosenbaum et al. [44], circulating FGF21 decreased upon a ketogenic dietary intervention, confirming its lack of involvement in ketosis effects in humans as opposed to murine models [38].  Interestingly, although liver function tests and hepatic steatosis index (HSI) decreased throughout the entire study, the deepest change was observed in the second, low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-phase, unlike other biochemical and anthropometric outcomes.",d02ece6b-5604-4f96-a99a-99543d30625b
17,methods17," This finding, on the one hand supports the hypothesis that Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD)s exert beneficial effects on Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [25] and, on the other hand confirms the non-linear weight loss-induced improvement of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) previously described [35]. In fact, it has been demonstrated that the greatest benefit of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) obtained from dietary interventions occurs when at least 10% weight reduction is achieved. Although slightly improved after the first phase of the study where the average weight loss was approximately 9%, none of the patients had an hepatic steatosis index (HSI) value ruling out Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). On the contrary, by the end of the low carbohydrate diet (LCD) phase, when the average weight loss was 12%, 80% had an hepatic steatosis index (HSI) incompatible with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",b635f8ac-c655-4bb8-8afd-70415a09ec57
18,methods18," The pathophysiological mechanism underlying the delay in NALFD improvement compared to other metabolic parameters has never been investigated. It seems reasonable to speculate that the resolution of liver injury itself involves a mechanism slower to set up compared to the improvement of other metabolic parameters. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies evaluating the rapidity of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) improvement compared to other biochemical variables after nutritional interventions, although some studies evaluating the effects of multi-step dietary regimens including a ketogenic phase collaterally reported a later improvement of transaminases [30,56].",2b991f4f-222b-42a8-8636-173ab6fefb70
19,methods19,"  When searching for predictors of fatty liver improvement, we found that baseline HOMA-IR was an independent predictor of greater hepatic steatosis index (HSI) reduction during the Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) step, suggesting that subjects with higher insulin resistance may benefit from a Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) intervention in terms of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) improvement, even before a 10% weight loss. This result may be explained by the extremely low carbohydrate content in Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD)s, which in turn decreases both fasting and postprandial insulin levels with a subsequent possible reduction of ectopic fat.  We also showed that baseline circulating FGF21 was a negative predictor of liver fat reduction throughout the entire study length.",c2bf453c-1280-4b30-83ee-0a4f4a31314f
20,methods20," Although FGF21-resistance has only been hypothesized in humans, in analogy with the concept of insulin resistance, we could infer that individuals with lower serum FGF21 might be more sensitive to its hepatoprotective action achieving a more pronounced improvement in liver fat accumulation upon a therapeutic intervention. These considerations suggest that human FGF21 could exert an active role in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) improvement, especially in those individuals whose metabolic disruption is not an “FGF21-resistant state”. Circulating FGF21 may therefore not only represent an index of improved liver metabolic status, but it could also predict the therapeutic success of diets in terms of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) amelioration.  Our study has some limitations that should be acknowledged.",f01df608-3645-4efa-8b7f-5b1c14774d9d
21,methods21," First, this was an observational, exploratory study, and the absence of a control group prevented any comparison with a balanced isocaloric diet, with no definitive conclusion possibly being drawn regarding the impact of the specific macronutrient composition of the Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) on study outcomes. Second, a significant number of patients dropped out before the end of the study, mostly during the low carbohydrate diet (LCD) phase. As no significant adverse event was reported by patients, we attributed the drop-out to poor compliance with the strict dietary program, especially in the low carbohydrate diet (LCD) phase when hunger may increase [57,58]. The observed drop-out led to a disparity in the number of patients in the three time points (n = 65 at T0, n = 63 at T45, n = 45 at T90), with consequent limitations in the statistic test’s power.",0fb307c0-5260-4521-a4a4-3e9bd623b9ee
22,methods22," Third, Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was only assessed through a surrogate, non-invasive marker, that despite being cost-effective, is subject to lower sensitivity and specificity compared to more sophisticated methods. Fourth, FGF21-resistance was only hypothesized, and no specific investigation relative to this was carried out. Of note, no validated method of diagnosis of FGF21-resistance is available to date. Fifth, ketosis was only indirectly assessed through semi-quantitative determination of urinary acetoacetate, and no serum b-OH-butyrate was measured. Sixth, patients’ compliance to the prescribed physical activity was unmonitored, and this may represent a bias for the interpretation of our results. Finally, the sample size was relatively small, although power calculation was performed in order to detect a significant liver fat reduction in the study population.  5.",7349589e-354a-4dde-8156-c14acd46abeb
23,methods23," Conclusions In conclusion, our preliminary findings suggest that individuals with IR derive greater benefit from a Very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) as opposed to those with less IR in terms of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) amelioration, hinting that such dietary intervention should be highly recommended to these patients. We also propose a role of endogenous FGF21 in mediating Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) improvement following a nutritional manipulation. However, further studies evaluating the link between FGF21 and Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are needed to investigate the timing of liver improvement in response to different dietary regimens and the direct role of FGF21 and FGF21-resistance in ensuring this improvement, possibly through the use of more reliable methods of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) diagnosis and monitoring such as histopathology evaluation.
