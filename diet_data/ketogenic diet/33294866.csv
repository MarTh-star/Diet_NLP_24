0,methods0," We reported a Chinese family with three members affected with Gene (GLUT)1-DS and searched for relevant articles up to September 2020 from PubMed, WOS, CNKI, and WanFang databases. A total of 30 Chinese patients diagnosed with Gene (GLUT)1-DS (three newly identified patients in one family and 27 previously reported ones) were included and analyzed in this study.

1,results0," The median age of onset of the 30 patients (male: 18, female: 12) was 8.5 months (range, 33 days to 10 years). Epileptic seizures were found in 25 patients, most with generalized tonic–clonic and focal ones. Movement disorders were found in 20 patients—frequently with ataxia and dystonia, developmental delay in 25 patients, and microcephaly only in six patients. The cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) analysis showed decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose (median: 1.63 mmol/L, range: 1.1–2.6 mmol/L) and glucose ratio of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to blood (median: 0.340; range: 0.215–0.484). The genetic testing performed in 28 patients revealed 27 cases with pathogenic variations of the SLC2A1 gene, including 10 missense, nine frameshift, three nonsense, three large fragment deletions, and two splice-site mutations. Most patients had a good response to the treatment of ketogenic diet or regular diet with increased frequency.",b9358643-e618-4ac7-b582-6e4959867823
2,results1," Although three patients in this Chinese family carried the same pathogenic mutation c.73C > T (p.Q25X) in the SLC2A1 gene, their symptoms and responses to treatment were not exactly the same.  Conclusion: The clinical manifestations of Gene (GLUT)1-DS are heterogeneous, even among family members sharing the same mutation. For children with unexplained epileptic seizures, developmental delay, and complex movement disorders, detection of low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose or SLC2A1 gene mutations is helpful for the diagnosis of Gene (GLUT)1-DS. Early initiation of ketogenic diet treatment significantly improves the symptoms and prognosis of Gene (GLUT)1-DS.",a4b5cb1c-f541-4e21-bb6e-edc349dab3b7
3,results2,"  Gene (GLUT)1 deficiency syndrome epilepsy developmental delay movement disorders SLC2A1 gene ==== Body pmcIntroduction  Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (Gene (GLUT)1-DS) is caused by impaired glucose transport through the blood–brain barrier and inherited in an autosomal dominant trait, which results from mutations of SLC2A1 gene encoding Gene (GLUT)1 . Autosomal recessive transmission has also been described in rare cases, whereas homozygosity showed embryonic lethality in a mouse model (Wang et al., 2006; Klepper et al., 2009; Rotstein et al., 2010). The classic phenotype is characterized by refractory infantile epilepsy, developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, and complex movement disorders, such as ataxia, dystonia, and spasticity, which was first described by De Vivo et al. in 1991 (De Vivo et al., 1991).",e323a575-ffef-4e59-8384-8a48f81e2703
4,results3," Over the past few decades, its clinical spectrum has broadened to include non-classic phenotypes, such as paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia and epilepsy, paroxysmal choreoathetosis with spasticity, atypical childhood absence epilepsy, and myoclonic astatic epilepsy . Additionally, paroxysmal non-epileptic events, including intermittent ataxia, paroxysmal eyeball movements, dysarthria, migraine, alternating hemiplegia, spastic paraparesis, and periodic confusion (De Giorgis and Veggiotti, 2013; Pearson et al., 2013; Nicita et al., 2019), and some extraneurologic features, like hemolytic anemia and cataracts, have also been described (Weber et al., 2008; Flatt et al., 2011; Bawazir et al., 2012). Despite its complex and variable clinical manifestations, Gene (GLUT)1-DS can be diagnosed based on the presence of hypoglycorrhachia and pathogenic variants of SLC2A1 gene.",344d1d71-8df2-443a-9873-6639e98c0553
5,results4," Ketogenic diet (KD) is recognized as the most effective treatment, which can provide ketone bodies to serve as an alternative fuel for the brain, and the earlier it is used, the better the prognosis will be .  In 2008, Bao et al. diagnosed a Chinese Gene (GLUT)1-DS patient for the first time in mainland China and then reported three Chinese Gene (GLUT)1-DS ones in 2012 . However, most (90%) detected SCL2A1 gene mutations are sporadic and de novo, whereas familial cases are rare . Here we reported a Chinese family with three members affected with genetically confirmed Gene (GLUT)1-DS and evaluated the efficacy of KD. Meanwhile, we analyzed and summarized the clinical and genetic characteristics of Gene (GLUT)1-DS in the newly identified and previously reported Chinese Gene (GLUT)1-DS cases.",83d6ff75-a81d-4063-b6db-d5ac64bda27f
6,results5,"  Patients and Methods  Case Presentation  The clinical data and blood and cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) samples of three Gene (GLUT)1-DS patients from one Chinese family were collected at the pediatric neurology clinics of Tongji Hospital. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Informed consent was obtained from the patients and their parents.  Patient 1  The proband was a 6-year-old girl born to non-consanguineous parents. The pregnancy and the delivery were normal. She began to speak and walk independently at the age of 19 months and had a normal head circumference. The seizures occurred at the age of 8 months and 1 year, respectively, presenting with eyes rolling involuntarily and lips cyanosis, but there were no seizures in the next 2 years.",2ea53838-752a-4871-8c50-752e0c75851a
7,results6," Until the age of 4 years, her symptoms evolved into dystonia, majorly with the head backward, stiffness of the right lower limbs, and hallux dorsal flexion. Occasionally, her right arm was rotated inward and could not be flexed, accompanied by crying and shaking of the whole body. At the early stage, these symptoms were mild, with a frequency of three to eight times per month, each lasting about 1 to 2 min. The electroencephalogram (each lasting about 1 to 2 min The electroencephalogram (EEG)) showed sharp waves and sharp slow waves in the right central temporal and left central region with a normal background during wake and sleep. Oral oxcarbazepine was then administered, but the attacks were not controlled completely. Since the age of 5 years, the frequency and duration of the attacks increased, ranging from once every 2 to 3 days to twice to thrice a day and lasting up to half an hour each time.",73ab177b-9db8-4aee-85a3-da5302812b5f
8,results7," Additionally, she experienced frequent paroxysmal hypokinesia with low muscle tone, which were relieved after resting. Nervous system physical examination was performed during the interictal period, and there was no abnormal muscle tension or strength and no positive ataxia signs, while the Assessment of the Child Development Scale indicated that her development was lagging behind mildly. The metabolic screening and other blood examinations were normal. KD was introduced along with oral oxcarbazepine when she was 5 years old, and it was tolerated well during the follow-up. Up to now, she has been free of these symptoms for nearly a year. The each lasting about 1 to 2 min The electroencephalogram (EEG) returned to normal after initiating KD for 2 months.

9,results8," He also had paroxysmal hypokinesia which occurred about once to twice a month and lasted 1–5 min each time. At 3 years old, he had binocular gaze in a daze with clear consciousness, similar to an atypical absence seizure. His physical examination was unremarkable, and the developmental assessment showed that his development was lagging behind mildly as well. His brain magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), video each lasting about 1 to 2 min The electroencephalogram (EEG)s, serum biochemistry values, and metabolic screening results were all normal. Considering the possible diagnosis of paroxysmal events related to epilepsy, sodium valproate (valproate (VPA)) was added. He displayed some responses to valproate (VPA), with the symptoms alleviated only partly. Then, he received cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and gene panel sequencing, which indicated hypoglycorrhachia (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose: 2.",f7808011-5021-4845-bebe-de8693e7b5d8

All these results clarified the final diagnosis of “Gene (GLUT)1-DS,” but his family did not pay attention to it further. His symptoms worsened at the age of 6 years when valproate (VPA) was discontinued by his parents, accompanied with an inability to speak or speaking vaguely—also called dysarthria and attacks of hallux-dorsiflexion, which lasted for a few minutes each time and were relieved spontaneously. Therefore, KD was introduced, and his symptoms remitted within 1 month. Up to now, he could go to school normally.  Patient 3  The father of patients 1 and 2, now at 31 years old, began to experience paroxysmal hypokinesia and could not move or walk for up to 10 min every time since he was 10 years old, without typical epileptic seizures.

Mutation hotspots are represented with an asterisk.  Genetic Analyses and In Silico Analyses  Whole-exome sequencing was performed in the proband (patient 1), and it revealed the pathogenic mutation c.73C > T (p.Q25X) in the SLC2A1 gene, which was identical to that of patient 2. The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in their parents and verified to be inherited from their father (patient 3). The nonsense variant was predicted by PVS1 as pathogenic based on the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.  The heterozygous substitution c.73C > T (p.Q25X) is a novel nonsense mutation in exon 2 that has not been previously reported, which is predicted to cause a premature termination at position 25 and the deletion of 467 amino acids (Figures 1B,C).",e5f1b503-2d69-4fa4-8f9c-0fbe9fc9df9a

A previous study has shown that, when the last 37 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of Gene (GLUT)1 were lost, the truncated proteins would abolish transport activity completely .  Systematic Review  We searched literatures about Chinese case reports of Gene (GLUT)1-DS in PubMed, WOS, CNKI, and WanFang databases (until September 2020). Patients who were described more than once in the literatures were included only one time.

24,discussion0," Glucose, the most essential energy source for brain metabolism, enters into the brain facilitated by Gene (GLUT)1. The cerebral metabolic rate for glucose was low at birth and then increased rapidly to reach adult level by 2 years old. At about 3 to 4 years old, it reaches a peak that exceeds adult level by over two folds, keeps up until 9 years of age, and then gradually decreases to adult rate again by the age of 20 years (Chugani et al., 1987; Chugani, 1998). Consequently, the seizures generally occur at 1–6 months after birth as the most common initial symptom of Gene (GLUT)1-DS and gradually reduce in adolescence, whereas these rarely appear during the neonatal period, but cyanotic or apnea episodes and paroxysmal eyeball movements—named aberrant gaze saccades—may occur before seizures in infancy , which are easily ignored or misdiagnosed as focal seizures. Among the 30 patients in our study, the earliest onset age was 33 days, and the median age was 8.",aec911ee-b5a2-4fc8-b509-7a997728030c

Approximately 90% of Gene (GLUT)1-DS patients have seizures of various types, including generalized tonic–clonic (GTC), absence, focal, myoclonic, atonic, tonic, and spasm seizures, in which generalized tonic–clonic (GTC) and absence seizures are the most common . Although seizures are often resistant to ASMs, some of which even inhibit the Gene (GLUT)1 function in vitro, such as phenobarbital, valproate, chloral hydrate, and diazepam (Klepper et al., 1999; Klepper et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2005), there are still about 8% of patients who respond positively to them . In this study, 83.3% of the 30 patients had epileptic seizures, and the seizure types in some patients evolved with age, with generalized tonic–clonic (GTC) (36.7%) and focal (30%) seizures mostly observed.",76303d1d-cd28-4cd5-ab93-1ed945610b71

Our study showed that one patient without seizures was found to be with epileptiform discharges, while seven cases with seizures had normal each lasting about 1 to 2 min The electroencephalogram (EEG) findings.

27,discussion3,"  Since infancy, the developing brain of Gene (GLUT)1-DS patients is unable to obtain enough energy for its growth, leading to cerebral dysfunction and limited head growth. The majority of patients with Gene (GLUT)1-DS have experienced some degree of cognitive impairment, ranging from mild learning disability to severe intellectual impairment. In this study, developmental delay was observed in 83.3% of the 30 patients, while microcephaly was not a key sign, only observed in 20% of patients. Furthermore, one patient with microcephaly had no developmental delay, indicating that microcephaly was not always accompanied by developmental delay.  The laboratory hallmark for Gene (GLUT)1-DS is low glucose of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (hypoglycorrhachia) when normoglycemic. Generally, fasting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose values are less than 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dl). In the majority (>90%) of cases, the values are less than 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dl).",589e5913-eac1-49ad-bb3b-0b2877e975ce
28,discussion4," Another less reliable biomarker is the glucose ratio of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to blood below 0.45 (De Vivo and Wang, 2008; Yang et al., 2011; Klepper, 2012; Leen et al., 2013), but normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose has also been reported in some patients with milder phenotypes. In addition, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate level from normal to low (<1.4 mmol/L) can help differentiate Gene (GLUT)1-DS from other causes of hypoglycorrhachia, such as meningitis, encephalitis, subarachnoidal haemorrhage, and some metabolic disorders, in which the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate level is elevated (>2.0 mmol/L) (Chow, 2005). Leen et al. (2013) suggested that it was unlikely to diagnose Gene (GLUT)1-DS if the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate was increased. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/blood glucose ratio were low in this study, ranging 1.1–2.6 mmol/L (median 1.63 mmol/L) and 0.215–0.484 (median 0.",9c426742-da89-4eca-959a-6e1d9e0c5349
29,discussion5,"340), respectively, which was consistent with that described above.  To date, SLC2A1 is recognized as the only gene associated with Gene (GLUT)1-DS mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p34.2), with a length of about 35 kb and containing 10 exons . Its coded protein Gene (GLUT)1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein and composed of 492 amino acids. It has 12 transmembrane domains that span the plasma membrane in an α-helical structure, forming a pore for the transport of glucose and other substrates, and is mainly distributed on brain endothelial cells, astrocytes, and erythrocytes . Since the first elucidation of its genetic–pathogenic roles , more than 200 SLC2A1 gene mutations have been described, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, and large fragment deletion mutations.",55c4ee65-c298-45bb-bf9b-d02ee6792040
30,discussion6," Several mutation hotspots within the SLC2A1 gene have been identified, such as Asn34, Gly91, Ser113, Arg126, Arg153, Arg264, Thr295, and Arg333 . However, about 5–10% of Gene (GLUT)1-DS cases were reported with absence of mutations in the SLC2A1 gene (Yang et al., 2011; Klepper, 2013). In our study, there was one case with a negative SLC2A1 gene mutation as well. Therefore, some studies have suggested that Gene (GLUT)1-DS may have undetectable variants in the non-coding regions or downstream of the DNA that could affect posttranscriptional modifications, such as mRNA splicing, protein assembly, folding, transportation, intracellular storage, and activation (Klepper and Leiendecker, 2007).",90ade1c1-66ba-42bb-9898-0a3178f22686
31,discussion7,"  Furthermore, the phenotypes and symptom severity of Gene (GLUT)1 patients with the same mutations were heterogeneous even among affected family members sharing the same mutation, indicating that secondary genes (such as PURA gene) and other modifying proteins might be involved in glucose transport or that DNA variant regulatory elements of the wild-type allele may modulate the expression level of Gene (GLUT)1 . Mayorga et al. (2018) reported a patient with a PURA gene mutation that had marked hypoglycorrhachia, overlapping the clinical findings with Gene (GLUT)1-DS, though no variants were found on the SLC2A1 gene. By western blot assays, they confirmed a significantly reduced expression of Gene (GLUT)1 in the peripheral blood cells of the patient compared to controls.",cf36a1fa-8d45-40e5-8b88-3479e3b5a3db
32,discussion8," Based on the known functions of PURA as a transcriptional and translational regulator, they proposed Gene (GLUT)1 as a new PURA target, and mutations in PURA can decrease Gene (GLUT)1 expression.  Though familial cases were usually correlated with milder manifestations compared to sporadic de novo cases (De Giorgis et al., 2015), attention should be paid to prenatal genetic counseling in familial cases because of phenotypic heterogeneity—even if a patient has very few and mild symptoms, and it is possible that offspring with the same mutation will be severely affected. Herein the familial cases in this study, who carried a nonsense mutation c.73C > T (p.Gln25*) and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, presented mild to moderate clinical phenotypes with overlapping but variable symptoms.",9005df1e-5b5a-419b-8fcb-94e273f7e05e
33,discussion9," The clinical manifestations of the father of the proband were mild, with only episodic hypokinesia but no intelligence or language disorder, which might be related to the late onset of the disease, while the phenotypes of the proband and her brother were moderate, including three main symptoms, and even evolved with age.  KD is the gold standard treatment for Gene (GLUT)1-DS, which should be started as early as possible and maintained at least until adolescence to meet the increased energy demand of the developing brain (Klepper, 2012; Kass et al., 2016). In our study, most patients were free of seizures and movement disorders after initiation of KD, and intelligence development and the head circumference of some patients recovered to normal levels. The other three patients treated with a regular diet of increased frequency also showed an improvement that might be classified as “carbohydrate-responsive” phenotype.",cf9802b6-dec9-4602-adca-82a8625f71c6
34,discussion10,"  In conclusion, the diagnosis of Gene (GLUT)1-DS is challenging due to its clinical heterogeneity. When children presented with unexplained epileptic seizures, developmental delay, and complicated movement disorder, Gene (GLUT)1-DS should be suspected and a fasting lumbar puncture or genetic testing is recommended. Once the diagnosis of Gene (GLUT)1-DS is confirmed, KD should be administered earlier and timely in order to gain a better prognosis.
