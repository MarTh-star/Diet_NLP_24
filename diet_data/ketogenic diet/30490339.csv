0,introduction0,"Infantile Spasms Syndrome (Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS)) is an infantile epileptic encephalopathy. It is characterized by epileptic spasms occurring around 6 months of age and most frequently severe abnormal interictal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, showing hypsarrhythmia or a similar pattern.1, 2   The etiology of Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS) is diverse. The most frequently encountered etiologies are hypoxic‐ischemic encephalopathy, chromosomal abnormalities, monogenic conditions such as tuberous sclerosis complex, and brain malformations. There is substantial genetic heterogeneity in the Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS) population with causative pathogenic variants involving more than 30 different genes,3 as recently illustrated in a study of 92 patients with Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS).4 However, in up to 40% of cases, the cause remains unidentified.",db6d4827-a4f6-42a1-89ae-47a07c1d1856
1,introduction1,"5, 6, 7 Irrespectively of the genetic etiology, converging lines of evidence suggest a pathogenetic role of glutamate‐N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA)) transmission in Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS).8, 9   The incidence of Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS) is 0.16–0.42 per 1000 live births.10 The prevalence is estimated to be 1–9/100,000, fulfilling the criteria for an orphan disease. Nevertheless, Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS) is the single largest epilepsy syndrome in the infantile period.11 Onset of spasms is often associated with developmental arrest or regression. The primary goal of treatment is to stop the spasms early in the course of the disease in order to minimize the developmental delay.12, 13, 14 Up to 20% of patients fail to respond to current standard of care (SoC) with hormonal therapy, vigabatrin, or their combination.",db7d120a-3390-4da6-b5c6-c70ad6fa89f2
2,introduction2,"14, 15   The SoC treatments with proven efficacy include hormonal treatments (al High‐dose corticotropin (ACTH), tetracosactide, or prednisolone) and vigabatrin. Vigabatrin was the first drug approved for the treatment of Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS) by the FDA. Although al High‐dose corticotropin (ACTH) has been used in infantile spasms since the first description of its efficacy in 1958, approval by the FDA was obtained in 2010.16   Infants who fail to respond to SoC represent the drug‐resistant Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS) population for which no established treatment is available. In those infants there is a clear unmet need for an efficacious treatment that will halt spams and related EEG abnormalities. Furthermore, such an efficacious treatment may eventually provide additional benefits to the entire Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS) population as a safer alternative to the current standard of care.",14b44ce6-82f4-43b3-ad86-94a6e0afd76f
3,introduction3,"  The NR2B subunit of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor is a relevant target for early onset epilepsy: rationale for potential therapeutic use of radiprodil N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate is one of the main excitatory glutamate receptors mediating a number of CNS functions including normal brain development and activity‐dependent synaptic plasticity.17 N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor dysfunction is also implicated in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including epilepsy.8, 9 N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists have been shown to have antiepileptic effects including anecdotal reports of memantine use in epileptic encephalopathies.18 Converging lines of evidence suggest the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor is involved in the disrupted electrical activity and generation of seizures observed in Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS).",c1cd94ae-baa9-45d6-b43c-dc1d04c2f08e
4,introduction4," Activation of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) induces spasm‐like seizures in rat pups,17, 19 and systemic administration of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) is used as an Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS) animal model characterized by interictal large amplitude asynchronous EEG abnormalities.20 During the first year of life in human, and during the corresponding age in rat pups, the composition of the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor is prevalently constituted by the NR2B subunit. The increased neural excitability during early development, coinciding with the typical onset time of Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS), may be at least partially mediated by an increased expression of NR2B‐containing N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors.17, 21 Indeed, NR2B‐selective compounds, such as ifenprodil, showed an age‐dependent anticonvulsant effect in rodents, which appears consistent with the increased expression of NR2B containing receptors early in the development.",fb4a6e0d-6b88-4e0c-acdb-df7fb2ef06d8
5,introduction5,"22, 23 More recently, de novo gain of function mutations of the GRIN2B gene, coding for the NR2B subunit, have been reported as a rare cause of Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS).24, 25 It could be then hypothesized that the NR2B subunit is a therapeutic target for Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS), and that compounds inhibiting its activity have the potential to suppress spasms.  Radiprodil is an orally active, negative allosteric modulator of NR2B receptors.26 Interestingly, in vitro electrophysiological studies indicate that radiprodil fully retains its pharmacological profile in human N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors expressing the aforementioned NR2B gain of function mutations associated with Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS), while other nonselective N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists lose their potency.26 Consequently, radiprodil could be a candidate drug with the potential for controlling spasms. Radiprodil was initially developed as a treatment for neuropathic pain.",616f96b4-3c51-4e6c-9031-a30241bc9d9e
6,introduction6," The clinical experience with radiprodil was obtained in 460 adult individuals, including healthy volunteers in the phase 1 program and 332 patients with neuropathic pain. Development in neuropathic pain was terminated due to lack of efficacy, however these studies established a well‐tolerated exposure range in adults which supported the dose selection for the Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS) study. To enable pediatric development, a juvenile toxicology study in rat pups was conducted, and the pediatric oral formulation was developed. Bioequivalence of the pediatric formulation was demonstrated (NCT02647697)27 and a microsampling technique for facilitating PK sampling in infant was validated.",4379f6d0-5143-41e3-9cc3-3ef3d2625d58

Radiprodil: Preclinical Data The anticonvulsant effects of radiprodil were assessed in two standard models of generalized and focal seizures in adult mice. In the audiogenic seizure model, radiprodil displayed very potent, dose‐dependent protective activity against generalized clonic convulsions, which are the key efficacy endpoint in this model. The obtained 50% effective dose (ED50) value was equal to 2.1 mg/kg (Fig. 1A). In contrast, radiprodil (up to 30 mg/kg) did not display any significant activity against focal seizures induced by electrical stimulation with 6 Hz current at 44 mA (data not shown).

Radiprodil: Clinical Results of Phase 1b Testing in Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS) Patients The clinical study was a phase 1b, open label, ascending dose adaptively designed study (NCT02829827).  The first two participants were enrolled as sentinel subjects before the inclusion of any additional infants. The aim was to include 10 participants in the first part of the study until an interim analysis, but the study was stopped earlier because of the challenge in recruiting patients meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria.

11,introduction11,"     Study drug Radiprodil was supplied as granules in bottles for oral suspension. The granules were reconstituted as a suspension prepared extemporaneously by adding 40 mL of diluent. Three dose levels of radiprodil were administered b.i.d.: 0.04 mg/kg (Low), 0.10 mg/kg (Medium), and 0.21 mg/kg (High).  Rationale for dose selection The selection of the first lower dose and the upper dose limit was determined using available data from previous clinical experience with radiprodil and based on a number of considerations on the known NR2B pharmacology. First, safety considerations were based on the observation that 30 mg single or multiple dose were considered safe and well tolerated in adults also after long‐term (14‐week) treatment. The drug exposure associated with 30 mg was expected to achieve a maximum of 80% NR2B occupancy, that is below the uneventful drug concentration achieved in the juvenile toxicology dose (projected to achieve ~95% NR2B occupancy).",096aea0a-b800-4161-aa75-52f9ce13d568

Participants taking hormonal treatments at the time of enrollment had their treatment discontinued in a tapered fashion. Participants taking vigabatrin continued on a stable dose. It was recommended that any other antiepileptic drugs for non‐Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS) seizures should have been given on a stable regimen during the radiprodil treatment period.  The radiprodil treatment period consisted of the titration, maintenance, and tapering periods. Following the baseline evaluation, each study participant entered an individualized dose titration schedule.

Interestingly, radiprodil displayed much stronger anticonvulsant effect in young rat pups than in adult animals.  The age‐dependent anticonvulsant effect of radiprodil was consistent with data obtained with another NR2B‐selective compound, ifenprodil.22, 23 The higher efficacy of radiprodil at that specific developmental age is likely to be explained by the developmental changes in expression of NR2B‐containing N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which predominate in the developing brain and are progressively outnumbered by NR2A‐containing N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors during adulthood.",2143269c-7b43-4ba7-be18-cd0e050d0180

26,discussion2," There are limited data providing evidence for the selection of the third or later lines of treatments. Accumulating prospective and retrospective studies suggest the ketogenic diet is beneficial, while conventional antiepileptic drugs do not provide significant seizure reduction.33 Felbamate is an antiepileptic drug that interferes with N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors by blocking the NR1A and NR2B subunits and also acts by blockage of the voltage‐gated sodium channels, potentiation of GABA receptor currents, and inhibition of voltage‐gated calcium currents.34, 35 In our centre, we recently reported that 28% of patients became spasm‐free with felbamate at a mean daily dose of 34.6 mg/kg after failure of at least three treatments (vigabatrin, steroids and also for most of them the ketogenic diet).29 Until recently very few Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS) patients have been reported as successfully treated by felbamate (n = 15).",23caaab6-e63f-45ed-b1dd-212f7dacfde4
27,discussion3,"36, 37 A 72% median reduction of spasms on felbamate compared to baseline was reported in 11 patients using 2‐h video‐EEG recordings as a primary endpoint.37 These clinical data contribute to the hypothesis that modulation of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and radiprodil can have a therapeutic role for Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS).  The phase 1b clinical study (NCT02829827) reported here, involved several centers in Europe. The study, however, was terminated because of the challenge in recruiting a sufficient number of patients within a reasonable time frame. Among the three infants enrolled to the study, one patient became spasm‐free, and two patients had clinical improvement followed by a worsening after radiprodil discontinuation.

A number of factors contributed to the difficulty in recruiting infants into the study. For safety purposes, the design of the study required that the first two infants treated by radiprodil remained admitted to the in‐patient department for about 2 months. This was a limitation for most of the centres and an extra burden for families. In addition to the low incidence of the syndrome, the more recent use of a combination of vigabatrin and oral steroids therapy has, most likely, further decreased the number of infants meeting the selection criteria.
