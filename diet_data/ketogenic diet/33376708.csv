0,methods0," Participants  We collected 30 patients with KCNT1-related epilepsy treated at our hospital. Detailed clinical data, including age at onset, seizure type, diagnosis, neurologic and cognitive deficits, treatment (ASMs, ketogenic diet therapy (KDT), quinidine), and genotype, were collected from patient records. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Peking University First Hospital (Approval Number: IRB00001052-17030). Written informed consent to participate in this study and for publication of the results was obtained from the guardians of all patients.  We also reviewed all previously published cases in which patients received quinidine (n = 40) (5, 12, 15, 16) or ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) (n = 14) (5, 12) for treatment of KCNT1-related epilepsy, with clear efficacy results. The total number of patients (ours and those in the literature) who received quinidine was 50 (Table 1) and the total number who received ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) was 23 (Table 2).",f9a8b160-fae1-435d-89f5-ac27e9a9c739

2,results0," Data were collected from 30 patients treated for KCNT1-related epilepsy at our hospital [17 boys and 13 girls; age at onset, 1.25 (0.04–36) months]. All patients had features of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, and their epilepsy treatments included ASMs, quinidine, and ketogenic diet therapy (KDT). The ER for all epilepsy treatments was 40%; the ERs for ASMs, quinidine, and ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) were 26.7% (4/15), 30% (3/10), and 44.4% (4/9), respectively. One patient received both ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) and quinidine, which was effective. Clinical data are shown in Table 4.  Table 4 Treatments.

Fifty patients, including those at our hospital and in previous reports, received quinidine, with an overall ER of 26.0% (13/50). The ERs for non-functional vs. functional domain variant-related epilepsy (37.5 vs. 20.6%) were not significantly different, nor were those for transmembrane vs. non-transmembrane domain variant-related epilepsy (36.4 vs. 23.1%). The ERs for RCK1 and non-RCK1 domain variant-related epilepsy were 13.6 and 35.7%, respectively, and this difference was of borderline significance (P = 0.077).",e1f4307c-1e99-41fc-b7a8-f693f36b803a
7,results5,"  Twenty-three patients, including those at our hospital and in previous reports, received ketogenic diet therapy (KDT), with an overall ER of 43.5% (10/23). There was no significant difference in the ERs for non-functional vs. functional (53.8 vs. 30%), RCK1 vs. non-RCK1 (50 vs. 41.2%), or transmembrane vs. non-transmembrane (57.1 vs. and 37.5%) domain variant-related epilepsy.  Finally, we compared the clinical efficacy of quinidine and ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) for treating KCNT1-related epilepsy. The overall ER was higher for ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) than for quinidine (43.5 vs. 26.0%; P = 0.135), as was the ER for RCK1 domain variant-related epilepsy (50 vs. 13.6%; P = 0.091); however, neither difference was significant. The ER for functional domain variant-related epilepsy was significantly higher for ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) than for quinidine (53.8 vs. 20.6%; P = 0.037).",d5c269a8-5a23-4064-8382-9f6ca6629682
8,discussion0," This study compared the efficacy of ASMs, quinidine, and ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) on KCNT1-related epilepsy treatment. Our results suggest that ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) may be a more effective treatment than is quinidine, whereas ASMs are the least effective.  Many studies have shown that quinidine effectively inhibits the electrical activity of Slo2.2 channels by blocking Na+ influx into cells (17–19); however, its clinical efficacy remains controversial (7–12). In this study, the overall ER for quinidine for KCNT1-related epilepsy was ~26.0–30.0%, indicating that not all patients with seizures benefit from quinidine treatment. Because the ER was based on combined quinidine and ASM treatment, we speculate that it may be worse for quinidine alone. Quinidine may indirectly control epilepsy by inhibiting the Na+ ion driving effect of the Slo2.2 channel, which reduces Na+ permeability.",19a9406b-3d74-484e-b965-d1ffd261f3da
9,discussion1," In this study, it was more effective for non-functional than for functional domain variant-related epilepsy, suggesting that mutations in the functional domain directly enhance K+ channel activity, and therefore, that the response to Na+ blockers was indirect and not obvious.  ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) was formally introduced as an epilepsy treatment in the twentieth century. It has become a commonly accepted treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy owing to its safety and few adverse reactions. In this study, the overall ER for ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) for KCNT1-related epilepsy was 43.5–44.4%, which was much higher than that for quinidine and ASMs. According to feedback from the parents of children undergoing ketogenic diet therapy (KDT), feeding difficulties are the most common problems in the treatment process.",8aee8fd5-953f-4995-bf6e-aeeb20d7e708
10,discussion2," Feeding difficulties can directly affect the concentration of ketone bodies in the body; therefore, we believe that the true efficacy of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) may be higher than the current result.  We found that ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) was more effective in patients with functional vs. non-functional domain-variant related epilepsy, but uniformly effective in patients with other types of domain variant-related epilepsy. Unsaturated free fatty acids have been reported to increase the activity of Ca+-activated K+ channels, thereby reducing the excitability of neurons (20). Thus, ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) may inhibit Slo2.2 channel activity via its effects on the levels of unsaturated fatty acids. Owing to their inhibitory effects on Na+ channels, unsaturated fatty acids in ketogenic diets may impede Na+ ion binding and the opening of Slo.2.2 channels, thus helping to manage epilepsy (21, 22).",c21f9ee8-7f72-40a0-a48c-b8762b3f7608
11,discussion3," The biological mechanism of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) is complex, multifaceted, and remains unclear; however, it may involve the combined actions of a variety of mechanisms. Hence, ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) potentially has a higher ER for KCNT1-related epilepsy.  In this study, ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) seems to have a significantly higher efficacy for KCNT1-related epilepsy than did ASMs and quinidine. Compared with quinidine, ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) was equally effective and more effective for non-functional and non-functional domain variant-related epilepsy, respectively. This result suggests that ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) is generally effective for all types of variant-related epilepsy, especially functional domain variant-related epilepsy; therefore, its mechanisms may be diverse. It also supports the use of quinidine for treatment of non-functional domain variant-related epilepsy.  This study had some limitations.",088e2f69-3b23-4b21-bcfb-1ba46b4a77d9
12,discussion4," Because it was retrospective, some clinical data were missing and the efficacy evaluation process was not always sufficiently detailed. We plan to perform a more detailed analysis in the future. In addition, not all results were statistically significant, although a tendency toward significance was noted in some instances. The lack of significance may reflect the limited number of cases; thus, more cases need to be accumulated to test the validity of our results.  Conclusion  We evaluated the efficacy of ASMs, ketogenic diet therapy (KDT), and quinidine for treating KCNT1-related epilepsy. ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) may be more effective than is quinidine and thus the more suitable treatment, whereas the efficacy of ASMs was poor.",53f9ab38-2b37-4456-a627-9149d263136a
13,discussion5," ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) and quinidine confer different therapeutic advantages depending on the KCNT1 variant: ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) was effective regardless of the variant and especially effective in patients with functional domain variant-related epilepsy, whereas quinidine was effective in patients with non-functional domain variant-related epilepsy. Clarifying the relationship between genotype and curative effect will help optimize treatments and improve outcomes in KCNT1-related epilepsy in clinical practice.
