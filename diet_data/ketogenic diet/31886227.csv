0,discussion0," 4.1 Patients In our literature research, we found six patients with POLG mutation and intractable seizures receiving ketogenic diet 2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5  (see Table 1). In five of these six patients, the diet led to substantial reduction of seizure activity, whereas general condition often did not improve. 2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6  Four of these five died shortly after initiation of therapy 2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  6  (see Table 1). One reported patient did not respond, hence therapy was stopped after 2 weeks 4  (see Table 1).  In our patient, ketogenic diet only showed initial improvement of symptoms, with an improvement of EEG, finally leading to a reduction of antiseizure therapy and a stabilization of her general condition over a short time. However, she showed an outstanding rapid deterioration leading to death 3 months after initial presentation.  4.",066f53be-62b1-4121-ace6-ab14125d4597
1,discussion1,"2 Ketogenic diet Ketogenic diet is used in inborn disorders of metabolism 10 ,  11  and is the treatment of choice in some of them; for example, glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome. 12 ,  13 ,  14  Further, ketogenic diet was found to be effective for therapy of intractable seizures. 11 ,  15 ,  16  However, the precise mechanism of action of the diet is not fully understood. As some inborn disorders of metabolism deteriorate with catabolism, ketosis should be reached and maintained without catabolism.  According to data, 1  most patients with POLG mutation presented with first symptoms in their early childhood. Our patient showed a juvenile and rapid progressive form of POLG mutation. The group of Martikainen presented a woman at the age of 26 years.5 Beside the adult patient, all patients died within 1 year after diagnosis. Thus, one might conclude that despite an initial improvement with ketogenic diet outcome is poor once symptoms have started.",8139a1aa-3e77-4d81-8a62-3820579a8107
