0,introduction0,"Ketogenic diets confer a multitude of beneficial effects on health in experimental and clinical settings, including weight loss in obesity and the amelioration of metabolic syndrome [1–5], anticonvulsant activity [6,7], autism [8], neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s [9–11], cardiomyopathy [12], and they show promise as potential adjunctive therapy for cancers [13,14]. However, the mechanisms through which ketogenic diets transduce their pleiotropic effects, and the long-term physiological and metabolic alterations that may occur during adherence to ketogenic diets, are incompletely understood. In particular, it is not clear whether beneficial effects of ketogenic diets are related to the generation and/or metabolism of ketone bodies, or whether the low carbohydrate content itself supports a salutary metabolic and/or endocrine milieu [7]. Rodents have been used extensively to determine the physiological and metabolic responses to ketogenic diets [15–21].",22e985b3-2a79-429a-9b9f-cc86500950b3
1,introduction1," However, because diet-induced ketonemia in rodents requires marked diminution of both carbohydrates and protein content, truly ketogenic diets for rodents consist of a macronutrient balance that humans do not ingest [22]. A widely used [8,12,15,16,18–21,23–25] micronutrient-supplemented ketogenic diet for rodents, Bio-Serv F3666, is very high in fat (93.3% kcal), very low in carbohydrate (1.8%), and relatively depleted of protein (4.7%). This diet provokes ketonemia, weight loss, and induces a hepatic gene expression signature consistent with decreased de novo lipogenesis and increased fatty acid oxidation [15,16]. C57BL/6J mice maintained on this ketogenic diet become lean, euglycemic, ketotic, hypoinsulinemic, and glucose intolerant [15,21]. Additionally, mice fed this ketogenic diet exhibit a distinctive nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) profile including micro- and macrovesicular steatosis with hepatocellular injury and repair.",fbc631d7-bf93-4c6c-9a8f-639784448404
2,introduction2," The macronutrient composition that induces this histological signature is atypical for human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is commonly associated with increased carbohydrate intake and activated de novo lipogenesis [16,26,27]. In fact, low carbohydrate diets in humans may improve nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [26–28].  To establish safe and effective therapeutic nutritional approaches for diseases that may be responsive to low-carbohydrate diets, it will ultimately be important to understand the driver mechanisms responsible for favorable responses, and whether these responses and their underlying mechanisms can be nutritionally dissociated from concomitantly-triggered pathophysiological responses. A potential contributor to the liver fat accumulation and injury that are provoked by Bio-Serv F3666 [16,21], despite its salutary effects in other organ systems [8,12,20], is protein restriction.",bfa98593-6b99-472e-ba5f-9990cd0e02e2
3,introduction3," In fact, Bio-Serv F3666 diet may mimic a subset of the systemic and hepatic sequelae of malnutrition attributable to very low protein ingestion in human patients with kwashiorkor [29]. An additional prospective explanation is the influence of choline restriction [30]. While fully replete rodent diets are supplemented to contain ≥ 2 g/kg choline, Bio-Serv F3666 is not supplemented, and therefore contains only ~300 mg/kg from naturally-derived fat sources. In this study, we examined the roles of dietary protein and choline contents on the systemic and hepatic derangements that occur in the setting of very high fat, very low carbohydrate diets. Using Bio-Serv F3666 as a reference diet, we designed a very low carbohydrate, very low protein, and choline restricted (VLP/C-) diet and three additional diets which differ only in total protein [10% kcal (low protein, LP) vs. 5% kcal (very low protein, VLP)] and choline content [replete (C+) vs.",be5ee87f-0f0e-452f-9d33-d430ddb461cd

6,methods1," Age-matched cohorts of mice were maintained on the standard low-fat, polysaccharide-rich chow pellets (Lab Diet 5053) to serve as controls. Consistent with the historically-used Bio-Serv F3666 diet, the contributing fat sources of all four ketogenic diets are lard and milk fat; casein is the protein source, and sucrose is the minimal carbohydrate source (~1% kcal). All diets were supplemented with vitamin mix AIN-76 and mineral mix AIN-76A. The distribution of fatty acids among all four diets is similar, with 46-52% originating from saturated, 38-41% from monounsaturated, and 7-17% from polyunsaturated fatty acids. Choline replete diets are supplemented with 5.0 g/kg supplied as choline bitartrate. All four diets are soy meal (phytoestrogen) free.

15,results0,"Comparison of choline replete and choline restricted, low- and very low protein diets on body composition and baseline metabolic parameters To determine the effects of choline and protein content on systemic and hepatic metabolism in the setting of very high fat (≥89% kcal), very low carbohydrate (~1% kcal) macronutrient composition, cohorts of 6 week-old C57BL/6J mice, all with mean starting weights between 20.0 and 21.0 g, were fed one of four custom paste diets for 6 weeks, defined as (1) low protein (~10% kcal), choline replete (LP/C+), (2) low protein, choline restricted (LP/C-), (3) very low protein (~5% kcal), choline replete (VLP/C+), and (4) very low protein, choline restricted (VLP/C-), and we compared responses of these groups of mice to a cohort maintained on standard chow (Table 1). The VLP/C- diet was formulated to replicate Bio-Serv F3666, a diet that we and others previously studied because it induces ketosis and weight loss in murine models [8,12,15,16,18–21,23–25].",3b4fe7a7-fb30-43db-b2cb-82fe7a629f9d
16,results1," Bio-Serv F3666 also causes hepatic steatosis, hepatocellular injury, and hepatic macrophage accumulation in C57BL/6J wild-type mice [16].  As previously observed in mice maintained on Bio-Serv F3666, but unlike mice maintained on standard chow or the other three experimental diets, mice maintained on VLP/C- diet for 6 weeks failed to gain weight (Figure 1A). While mice maintained on VLP/C+ gained weight over the 6 week period, the extent of weight gain was ~60% less than that of mice maintained on standard chow, LP/C+, or LP/C-. Differences in weight gain between VLP/C+ and VLP/C- fed cohorts may be partially attributable to diminished caloric consumption by mice fed VLP/C- (Figure 1B), but normalizing caloric consumption to body weight revealed no differences between these two diet cohorts (Figure 1C).",ad5da9b7-c3bc-445c-8565-7671a2d9961b
17,results2," Independent of whether caloric consumption was normalized per animal or to body mass, caloric intake was increased in all cohorts of mice fed these paste diets, compared to chow-fed mice. Together, these observations are consistent with increased energy expenditure of mice maintained on these very high fat diets (compared to standard chow), which was observed in studies of mice maintained on Bio-Serv F3666 [15,21]. Irrespective of choline content, LP diet-ingesting cohorts both gained significantly more weight than mice in the VLP-ingesting cohorts, indicating that increased protein content of these two diets supports weight gain [34]. Percent adiposity, measured by MRI, was commensurate with the chow-fed cohort for mice maintained on LP/C-, VLP/C+, and VLP/C- (Figure 1D), while mice fed LP/C+ displayed a significant increase in adiposity relative to the other cohorts.  10.1371/journal.pone.0074806.",85948df5-d66f-4c9a-8753-ea7574b0eddf

Compared to the chow-fed cohort, whose serum βOHB concentrations were 0.10±0.03 mM, all groups of mice fed the experimental diets for 6 weeks developed statistically significant ketosis (Table 2). Mice maintained on VLP/C- exhibited the highest βOHB mean serum concentration, 1.46±0.34 mM (n=10). Increasing protein content had a modestly stronger suppressive effect on ketosis than replenishing choline: mice maintained on LP/C- exhibited serum βOHB concentrations that were 2.4-fold lower compared to VLP/C--fed mice (0.60+0.08 mM in LP/C- mice; p=0.03 compared to the VLP/C- group, n=10/group), while the addition of choline to VLP/C- (i.e.",ced34e79-9fe3-47f5-bbaa-3363ac85c930

Taken together, the greatest degree of ketosis was observed in mice maintained on VLP/C-, and the addition of choline to this diet did not abrogate ketosis, as mice maintained on VLP/C+ display an 8-fold elevation in serum βOHB concentrations compared to chow-fed mice (p<0.0001, n=8-11/group).  10.1371/journal.pone.0074806.t002Table 2 Serum parameters after 6 weeks on diets.

Only VLP/C--fed mice exhibited markedly diminished serum insulin concentrations compared to those of chow-fed mice, which accounts for the markedly decreased HOMA-IR index in this cohort (2.9±0.5 vs. 8.2±1.1 in VLP/C- and chow-fed mice, respectively, p=0.0003, n=5-10/group). Additionally HOMA-IR indices of VLP/C--fed mice are significantly lower than those of mice fed LP/C- (8.6±1.8, p=0.007, n=10/group).

Effects of dietary choline and protein content on hepatic steatosis and histopathology To determine the effects of dietary protein and choline levels on hepatic structure and function, we quantified hepatic mass and intrahepatic triglyceride content after 6 weeks on each diet. Mice fed either choline restricted diet (VLP/C- or LP/C-) exhibited liver weight to body weight ratios that were ~25% increased compared to mice fed the choline replete diets (LP/C+ and VLP/C+) (Figure 2A). Additionally, normalized liver weights of mice fed either choline replete paste diet were ~13% smaller compared to chow-fed mice.

42,results28," Taken together, these results indicate that choline restriction in the setting of a high fat, very low carbohydrate diet contributes to abnormal hepatic mitochondrial function, potentially impairing terminal oxidation of fatty acids and contributing to hepatic triacylglycerols (TAG) accumulation. It is important to note that the deficiencies of mitochondrial coupling and efficiency exhibited by isolated hepatocyte mitochondria from VLP/C--fed mice likely underestimate in vivo bioenergetic dysfunction, because an enriched population of relatively intact mitochondria is assayed using readily accessible experimental substrates. Therefore integration of the mitochondrial structure and disordered spatial organization with these respiration studies suggests significantly impaired mitochondrial function in hepatocytes of VLP/C--fed mice.

A commonly used rodent high fat, and very low protein, very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet, Bio-Serv F3666, has been employed to measure the effects of the ketogenic nutrient milieu on integrated metabolic homeostasis, and has also been used to mitigate abnormal phenotypes in the nervous and cardiovascular systems in mutant mouse strains. However, this diet also induces hepatic steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury and repair in mice.",7ec8de50-e468-4511-8000-da19187f4331
44,discussion1," To determine the underlying nutritional determinants of these adverse effects, we replicated this formulation by generating the VLP/C- diet, which recapitulated the integrated metabolic and hepatic histopathological responses to Bio-Serv F3666 in C57BL/6J mice, and then tested three additional diets that systematically varied protein and choline content in VLP/C-. We observed that while protein and choline restriction synergistically contribute to the integrated metabolic phenotypes provoked by a high fat, very low carbohydrate diet in mice, choline restriction in this setting stimulated hepatic fat accumulation to a greater extent than protein restriction. Replenishment of choline in the VLP diet (i.e., comparing VLP/C- to VLP/C+), markedly diminished hepatic fat accumulation, while increasing dietary protein content to 10% kcal in the setting of restricted choline (comparing VLP/C- to LP/C-) exhibited a smaller mitigating effect on hepatic steatosis.",08ab407f-93aa-4f70-8f2d-37b2590c96d6
45,discussion2," Adding protein to a choline-replete diet (comparing VLP/C+ to LP/C+) exerted marginal additional effect on hepatic histopathology. While subtle variations were evident in histopathological inflammation and in serological evidence of hepatocellular injury (elevated aminotransferase (ALT)) among mice maintained on the four paste diets, significant differences in the hepatic density of F4/80+ macrophages after 6 weeks on the diets were not observed. We previously demonstrated that mice maintained on Bio-Serv F3666 (most similar to VLP/C-) exhibit an increased density of hepatic F4/80+ macrophages after 12 weeks on the diet [16]. Prolonged exposure to these high fat diets likely exacerbates hepatic inflammation through mechanisms summarized elsewhere [26]. Only VLP/C-, which caused the greatest degree of fat accumulation, induced histopathological evidence of hepatocyte regeneration at the 6 week time point, suggesting that this diet provokes the greatest degree of hepatocellular injury.",8df48fb4-ef4e-4f56-801b-e5ec2e0505e5
46,discussion3," Taken together, these findings suggest that inflammation and hepatocellular injury are likely secondary to the extent and duration of the metabolic abnormalities imposed by the nutrient contents.  Experiments in rodents have revealed molecular underpinnings of liver fat accumulation using methionine and choline deficient (methionine and choline deficient (MCD)) diets [30,41], and diminished choline intake has also been associated with a more aggressive nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) course in humans [42]. The ability of experimental methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diets to trigger steatosis and liver injury is facilitated by abundant mono- or disaccharides in the diet, because replacing these simple carbohydrates with starch markedly ameliorates the adverse histopathological effects of the methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet, a portion of which is hypothesized to occur through increased de novo lipogenesis [31,43].",8c154d96-b64c-471a-9c74-b21f7b874ae4
47,discussion4," Our results indicate that choline restriction also triggers hepatic steatosis and hepatocellular injury during a nutritional state in which the mediators of de novo lipogenesis are transcriptionally silenced due to very high fat content in the diet and diminished circulating insulin concentrations. The metabolism of choline has been mechanistically linked in mice to very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) packaging and secretion through its direct contribution to PC synthesis [35]. Genetic models indicate that metabolic procession of choline through the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) N-methyltransferase pathway, which synthesizes methionine from homocysteine and choline-derived methyl groups, is also an important contributor to very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion [35,44].",50d696fa-5e96-459a-aaf9-0a5e7409f421
48,discussion5," However, in our experiments, while hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion was impaired in mice maintained on all the paste diets, no additive effect of choline restriction was observed in these macronutrient contexts. It is therefore unlikely that an impairment of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion explains the marked fatty liver phenotype of VLP/C--fed mice.  Mitochondrial dysfunction is a known contributor to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis [26,45]. Thus, we assessed hepatic mitochondrial structure and function in mice fed these very high fat diets. In mice maintained on VLP/C- diet, we observed chaotic mitochondrial ultrastructure, including swollen cristae and many degenerating mitochondria. Choline repletion in the VLP diet was associated with improved mitochondrial ultrastructure and respiratory coupling and capacity in isolated mitochondria.",e8040918-eb68-4e6c-9b84-9167de7e4b18
49,discussion6," However, choline repletion in the VLP diet did not correct the reduction in mitochondrial DNA content. Nonetheless, choline repletion may partially mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction by contributing to PC synthesis. PC is a major constituent of all cellular membranes, including mitochondria [36,37]. Though the exact phospholipid composition of membranes varies among experimental contexts, PC and PE constitute approximately 40% and 30% of the mitochondrial membranes, respectively [46]. Experimental choline deficiency in lower fat diet formulations than those tested here causes a decreased ratio of total hepatic PC/PE [44,47–49] and hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction [38–40]. Furthermore, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients have a reduction of the total hepatic PC/PE ratio and impaired hepatocyte membrane integrity [44,50].",91405443-7c3b-443f-9801-ffa2a3fb3df2
50,discussion7," Maintenance of mitochondrial function requires homeostatic membrane phospholipid composition to coordinate surface charge, stereoelectronic relationships, and membrane dynamics that each effect membrane function and structural integrity, critical determinants of mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation [51–53].  Adaptation to a diet with ~90% kcal derived from fat requires integration of hepatic mitochondrial fatty acyl-CoA transport, esterification and storage in neutral pools, lipoprotein secretion, and lipolysis, with mitochondrial β-oxidation, ketogenesis, tricarboxylic acid (tricarboxylic acid (TCA)) cycle, electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 9), and impairment of hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation contributes to liver fat accumulation [54]. Effective procession of fatty acids through integrated mitochondrial pathways also stimulates gluconeogenesis [55,56].",751c7920-1cbf-4cab-8d95-f33f806810cf
51,discussion8," Of the four paste diets tested, however, only VLP/C--fed mice were not hyperglycemic. Moreover, basal hepatic glucose production of mice maintained on the VLP/C- parent diet Bio-Serv F3666 is normal, despite delivering > 90% kcal as fat, and a poor hepatic suppressive response to exogenous insulin [21]. A likely contributor to relative hypoglycemia in VLP/C- and Bio-Serv F3666-fed mice is hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction that prevents adequately matched fatty acyl-CoA mitochondrial uptake and terminal oxidation. Differences in extrahepatic glucose disposal could also contribute to relative hypoglycemia in VLP/C- mice, but glucose excursions among the four paste diets were not significantly different (data not shown).",3c86988b-eea8-4eae-ad31-6b054f37fa6b
52,discussion9," Hyperglycemia in mice fed LP/C-, despite steatosis and likely hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction, is multifactorial but is most likely attributable to additional dietary glucogenic amino acids that support gluconeogenesis after conversion to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates.  10.1371/journal.pone.0074806.g009Figure 9 Influence of choline restriction in integrated hepatic mitochondrial fatty acyl-CoA metabolism. Red text and red arrows highlight hepatic processes known to be impaired by administration of experimental choline deficient diets. Unlike previous observations using lower fat choline deficient versus replete formulations, in this study, choline repletion in ~90% kcal fat diets did not alter triacylglycerol (triacylglycerols (TAG)) secretion as very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). However, choline restriction in a ~90% kcal fat diet was associated with mitochondrial structural and functional abnormalities, which were linked to liver fat accumulation and injury.",596a0d11-aa79-4f34-930e-8aa562667dea

Choline deficient diets provoke defects in carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT 1) dependent fatty acyl-CoA transport [57], palmitate oxidation [57], electron transport [58], and as a result, gluconeogenesis [59,60] (Figure 9). Conversely, ketogenesis is not directly impaired by choline deficiency: both the fate-committing ketogenic enzyme, mitochondrial hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2), and the enzyme catalyzing the subsequent ketogenic reaction, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase, are soluble mitochondrial matrix enzymes that are influenced only indirectly by dysfunctional mitochondrial membrane structure and function.",6a2e25f2-b2bd-4a7c-8c19-8bd9349947f5
54,discussion11," The results of these experiments strongly suggest that the robust ketosis in VLP/C- mice reports the relative fraction of fatty acyl-CoAs that successfully complete hepatic β-oxidation, and not those that fail to gain entry into mitochondria or those that cannot complete terminal oxidation. Therefore, compared to their choline restricted counterparts, ketosis was less pronounced in mice fed the very high fat, choline replete diets in part because integrated hepatic mitochondrial function supports mitochondrial acyl-CoA uptake and terminal oxidation. Conversely, relative suppression of ketosis in mice fed choline restricted LP/C-, compared to mice fed VLP/C-, is attributable to (i) the sensitivity in rodents to amino acid-mediated insulin secretion [22,61], which in turn suppresses ketogenesis [62], and (ii) the modest ability of amino acid-derived gluconeogenic metabolites to suppress ketogenesis [63].",4cd20811-0887-42fa-a90a-c1db668f3384
55,discussion12,"  The independent contributions of choline and methionine deficiencies to abnormal hepatic metabolism and pathology in mice are incompletely understood because studies performed heretofore suggest macronutrient context-dependent effects of each of these micronutrients. In the context of carbohydrate-enriched diets, selective choline deficiency drives hepatic steatosis, while selective methionine deficiency has been linked to hepatic inflammation, oxidative stress and hepatocellular injury [64]. Conversely, mice fed a high fat (60% kcal), 26% kcal carbohydrate diet are protected against hepatic triacylglycerols (TAG) accumulation, and do not exhibit overt inflammation or hepatocellular injury by methionine restriction [65].",cb16405a-ec80-406e-8803-d74caec83a0a
56,discussion13," Because thresholds for methionine deficiency-induced hepatocellular injury are unknown and are highly dependent on macronutrient distribution, these studies were not designed to definitively segregate the independent roles of methionine and choline restriction in the observed hepatic phenotypes. Nonetheless, this study supports the supplementation of choline in rodent experiments that are targeted to understand the physiological adaptations and responses to diet-induced ketosis. These experiments also demonstrate that nutritional induction of ketosis by a very high fat, very low carbohydrate diet in mice can occur in the context of maintained weight and hyperglycemia. Therefore, experimental use of VLP/C+ diet may allow mechanistic partitioning of the relative roles of glycemia versus ketosis in experimental conditions that are ameliorated by ketogenic diets.",5dc06070-5d96-452c-a867-2576469f2525
57,discussion14,"  An additional limitation of this study is that formal methods of hepatic biometry and stereology were not used for histopathological quantification of hepatocyte and fat droplet sizes [66], and for histopathology, relatively small numbers of animals were analyzed for each group. Nonetheless, hepatic histopathological characteristics were highly uniform among animals within each diet condition, and complementary formal biochemical quantification of hepatic fat was performed in larger numbers of animals. Moreover, effects of each of the five diets studied were determined in at least three separate cohorts of mice that were matched for age, strain, sex, and body weight at the time of initiation of each of the study diets. Analyses of histopathology, serum and hepatic biochemistry, and mitochondrial function were performed among these replicating cohorts to confirm reproducibility of the results.",bff64df2-49b7-4daa-a2ef-019b0469245c
58,discussion15," Future experiments will incorporate formal histopathological quantifications that reveal the mechanistic determinants relating these nutritional states to hepatic lipid droplet size and abundance.  In summary, these experiments demonstrate that the unique signature of hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation, and cellular and mitochondrial injury induced in mice maintained on a very high fat, protein-restricted, very low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet can be linked to the adverse effects of choline deficiency on hepatic mitochondrial structure and function. The findings also underscore the concept that ketosis does not necessarily report effective hepatic fatty acid oxidation when supply overwhelms relative mitochondrial capacity. In setting of the VLP/C- diet, ketogenesis provides a spill-over pathway that only partially compensates for inadequate fatty acid catabolism.",6d6a1a8a-25b7-4fc8-9ddd-87dec6a233fd
59,discussion16," However, it is important to note that while incompletely studied, ketogenic diets in humans are unlikely to cause mitochondrial dysfunction or fatty liver. Nonetheless, attentiveness to choline content, and its downstream effects on membrane phospholipid composition and function are important considerations when designing and measuring the physiological effects of low carbohydrate diets, which ultimately will require integration of biochemical approaches to quantify compartment-specific phospholipidomics with measurements of mitochondrial function, biogenesis, and autophagic turnover.
