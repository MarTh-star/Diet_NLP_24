0,introduction0,"Emerging evidence suggests that ketogenic diet (KD)- and exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS))-evoked ketosis may have a modulatory role in physiological and pathophysiological processes of the central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)). For example, ketone bodies, such as β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc), provide fuel to brain cells for mitochondrial ATP synthesis, modulate functioning of neurotransmitter systems (e.g., glutamatergic, GABAergic, and adenosinergic systems) and ion channels (Newman and Verdin, 2014; Sharma et al., 2015; Achanta and Rae, 2017), and enhance (generate) neuroprotective effects (e.g., decrease the production and release of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β) (Maalouf et al., 2009; Youm et al., 2015; Norwitz et al., 2019).",ed94de50-f16e-4972-8869-1785e8f8c387
1,introduction1," Consequently, it has been demonstrated that ketone bodies may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of several central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease), and psychiatric disorders (e.g., anxiety and depression), likely through ketosis-evoked neuroprotective effects (Hashim and VanItallie, 2014; Ari et al., 2016; Kovács et al., 2019a), and other age-associated diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases and cancer) .  It has also been demonstrated that not only KDs (containing high-fat, adequate protein, and restricted carbohydrate) but also exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)s, such as ketone ester (KE), ketone salt (KS), medium-chain triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) oil, and their mixes (e.g., KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT)), can evoke and maintain ketosis in both animals and humans (Ari et al., 2016; Kesl et al., 2016; Stubbs et al.",ef866a1f-9968-463f-b12f-3ed77e96afb6
2,introduction2,", 2017; Kovács et al., 2019b). Moreover, exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)s are well-tolerated and can generate therapeutic ketosis (ketone levels = 1–7 mM) while maintaining a normal diet (Clarke et al., 2012; Hashim and VanItallie, 2014; Ari et al., 2016; Stubbs et al., 2017). Consequently, exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS) administration-generated therapeutic ketosis may be a safe alternative method (D’Agostino et al., 2013; Ari et al., 2016; Stubbs et al., 2017) to circumvent dietary restrictions and adverse effects by KDs (e.g., nephrolithiasis, growth retardation, constipation, and hyperlipidemia)  and to treat not only several central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as epilepsy, psychiatric diseases (e.g., anxiety), neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease), and cancer (Newport et al., 2015; Kovács et al., 2017, 2019a; Berk et al.",29c12a05-2f4c-439d-8717-a7d1ef6d31ce
3,introduction3,", 2020), but also, among others, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, cardiovascular disease, glucose intolerance, and type 2 diabetes .  After ingestion of exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)s, ketone bodies (e.g., βHB) can enter into several organs, such as the heart and brain, and exert their neuroprotective effects through enhancement of energy metabolism, modulation of signaling systems, activation of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2, and inhibition of histone deacetylases (Sato et al., 1995; Maalouf et al., 2009; Achanta and Rae, 2017; Norwitz et al., 2019). It has been demonstrated that metabolism and utilization of ketone bodies on central nervous system (CNS) processes may be regionally different (Hawkins and Biebuyck, 1979; Hawkins et al., 1986; Bilger and Nehlig, 1992).",d7465598-3c59-41fb-a0c6-451ebd82a5fa
4,introduction4," Moreover, KD- and exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)-generated changes in blood level of ketone bodies and glucose and, as a consequence, their effects on physiological and pathophysiological processes of different organs may be modulated by gender and age (Page et al., 1971; Buc et al., 1986; Nehlig and Pereira de Vasconcelos, 1993; Vannucci, 1994; Cao et al., 2017; Ari et al., 2019, 2020). These results suggest that the alleviating effects (e.g., neuroprotective influences) of KD- and exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)-evoked increase in ketone body levels may be age- and gender-dependent in the treatment of different diseases, such as ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and epilepsy (Freeman et al., 1998a; Rho et al., 1999; Appelberg et al., 2009). Indeed, for example, KD improved motor and cognitive recovery after traumatic brain injury only in 35-day-old rats, but not in 75-day-old rats (Appelberg et al.",7d04969e-6edb-4430-b516-5077d1917d0c
5,introduction5,", 2009), and the antiepileptic effect of KD was better in younger animals and children, which may be in correlation with the more efficient extraction and utilization of ketone bodies from the blood, compared with adults (Freeman et al., 1998b; Bough et al., 1999; Rho et al., 1999). These results lead to the crucial question of whether age and sex can modulate exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)-evoked changes in not only blood βHB but also glucose levels.  It has been demonstrated previously that exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)-evoked ketosis can generate beneficial (modulatory) effects on absence epilepsy (Kovács et al., 2017, 2019b), anxiety , sleep-like effects , and motor performance  in a well-investigated model animal of human absence epilepsy Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats (Coenen and Van Luijtelaar, 2003).",bd984ce9-b2b3-46fc-bd43-eca58c819f31
6,introduction6," Theoretically, these beneficial influences of exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)s, which are likely generated through ketosis (Ari et al., 2016, 2018, 2020; Kovács et al., 2017), can be modulated by age and gender, but systematic investigation of the putative influences of age and gender on exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)-evoked effects through several months was not carried out previously. Therefore, this study extends our previous results on exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)-evoked effects in WAG/Rij rats in order to obtain further understanding of how age and sex regulate exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)-generated changes in blood βHB and glucose levels.",09d2df29-1b3f-464a-86dc-d574b4405b2a
7,introduction7," We investigated the alteration of exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)-evoked changes in these parameters in WAG/Rij rats of both sexes between 1 and 17 months of age, using a previously established effective dose of a ketone supplement mix (KE and medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil in a 1:1 ratio: KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT); 2.5 g/kg, gavage) .

9,methods1," All efforts were made to minimize pain and suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.

(Urbana, IL, United States), whereas medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil (pharmaceutical grade; approximately 60% caprylic triglyceride and 40% capric triglyceride) was purchased from Now Foods (Bloomingdale, IL, United States).

To familiarize the animals to the gavage method, all KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) gavage treatments were preceded by water gavage (2.5 g/kg) for 4 days (adaptation period). Levels of blood βHB and glucose were measured 1 h after gavage (between gavage and βHB/glucose measurements, the animals had free access to food and water). Control βHB and glucose levels were measured on the last (4th) day of the adaptation period. KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) supplementation (2.5 g/kg, gavage), as well as measurements of KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT)-induced changes in blood βHB and glucose levels, was performed on the 5th day. Thus, because of the procedure of gavage, the experiments were started on 1-month-old rats. A similar protocol was repeated once every month for 17 months.

11,methods3,"  Measurement of Blood βHB and Glucose Levels as Well as Body Weight Similar to our previous studies (Kovács et al., 2018, 2020), blood was taken from the tail vein of rats about 60 min after the gavage, and βHB and glucose levels were measured by a commercially available glucose and ketone monitoring system (Precision XtraTM, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, United States). This instrument only measures blood levels of R-βHB. Thus, total blood ketone levels (R-βHB + S-βHB + AcAc + acetone) would be higher than we measured. Body weights of rats were also measured every month 1 day before the adaptation period.

Glucose and R-βHB levels of the 2nd and 17th months were also compared with the levels of the 1st month. Moreover, we also compared blood concentration of glucose and R-βHB of males and females measured on every control day (4th adaptation day) and every KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) gavage day for 17 months.

Moreover, significant differences between control R-βHB levels of female vs. male rats were not identified (Figure 2A and Table 1, third column). After KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) gavage, similar blood R-βHB levels were demonstrated between the 2nd and 17th months, compared with baseline blood R-βHB level (1st month) in female animals (Table 1, fourth column).",5d3f8fd2-6c82-4865-9ae4-e474557d4db7

Mix of KE and medium chain triglyceride (MCT) can be metabolized in the gut and liver. KE hydrolyzes to AcAc and 1,3-butanediol by gut esterases, the component parts of which transport to the systemic bloodstream. AcAc can be transported from the intestinal lumen through intestinal epithelial cells by monocarboxylate transporters to the blood and may be utilized by cells of extrahepatic organs for energy production (Halestrap, 2013; Newman and Verdin, 2014). 1,3-Butanediol molecules further metabolize to ketone bodies, such as βHB, in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenases and aldehyde dehydrogenases.",6bc7e50b-9104-467f-83a3-691a527598aa
27,discussion1," medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil can hydrolyze to medium-chain fatty acids in the gastrointestinal tract by lipases followed by direct absorption through the gut wall, and subsequently, medium-chain fatty acids may metabolize to ketone bodies in the hepatocytes (Tate et al., 1971; Clarke et al., 2012; Schönfeld and Wojtczak, 2016). Indeed, free fatty acids can convert into acyl-CoA in the liver, and acyl-CoA may metabolize to acetyl-CoA via mitochondrial β-oxidation. Acetyl-CoA may enter the Krebs cycle or convert into ketone bodies, such as βHB, by several metabolic enzymes such as acetoacetyl-CoA-thiolase, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA-synthase (Middleton, 1972; Hegardt, 1999), and βHB dehydrogenase (β-OHBD) (Lehninger et al., 1960; Kalapos, 2003). Ketone bodies can exit the liver via monocarboxylate transporters, enter the bloodstream and subsequently to various organs (e.g.",f917c379-3933-4112-a8da-fec09a8dbad5
28,discussion2,", brain, heart, and muscle), and serve for ATP synthesis (Halestrap, 2013; Newman and Verdin, 2014; Achanta and Rae, 2017).  It has been demonstrated that expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 in the blood–brain barrier (Nehlig and Pereira de Vasconcelos, 1993; Gerhart et al., 1997) and cerebral glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and GLUT3 (Vannucci, 1994), as well as the activity of ketone body metabolic enzymes, such as β-OHBD, succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase, and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase , may be age-dependent, not only in the rat brain but also in rat heart and kidney . It has also been demonstrated that ketone body production of hepatocytes was higher in 8–10-week-old male rats, compared with female rats , and ketogenic capacity and β-OHBD activity were higher in male rats than in female rats under fasting condition (Teutsch, 1984), suggesting sex-dependent differences in ketone body metabolism of the liver.",fed9e967-842d-4189-bf3b-077396425ced

Female sex hormones can downregulate the hepatic expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1, whereas hepatic monocarboxylate transporter 4 expression may be modulated by testosterone . However, the levels and generation of ketone bodies increased more markedly in females than in males, not only in mice but also in humans under fasting conditions , likely by the modulatory effects of sex hormones . More rapid and greater decrease in blood glucose level was also demonstrated in women, compared with men during starvation, whereas the basal level of glucose and βHB was similar in both sexes , and higher hepatic glucose output was revealed in male rats during starvation .",abc183e1-6964-4566-b499-b1b676dc50a8
30,discussion4," Expression of hypothalamic GLUTs (e.g., GLUT1) increased by age in male, but not in female rats, and male adolescent rats had lower GLUT1 expression, than female adolescent rats .  Previous studies show that WAG/Rij rats spontaneously develop absence epileptic seizures (spike-wave discharges: SWDs) after about 3 months of their age (Coenen and Van Luijtelaar, 2003). SWD number gradually increases by age, but significant sex differences in changes in SWD number were not demonstrated in WAG/Rij rats (Coenen and Van Luijtelaar, 1987, 2003). It was suggested that glucose metabolism may be higher in absence epileptic animals, such as GAERS rats (Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg), compared with non-epileptic control rats (Depaulis and Van Luijtelaar, 2006), but it may correlate with interictal periods, but not with the occurrence of SWDs . Moreover, glucose release from hepatocytes may increase by age in WAG/Rij rats (Teillet et al.",4362efc4-ed2e-4108-ab13-770ddc27a778
31,discussion5,", 2001). However, we found that the control level of glucose (and its changes) was similar until approximately 14 months of their age in both sexes of WAG/Rij rats, but subsequently, glucose levels were gradually increased and decreased in female and male rats, respectively (Figure 3A). These results suggest that changes in blood glucose levels may be independent from changes in SWD number, and there may be sex-dependent differences in glucose utilization at least in older than 1-year-old WAG/Rij rats. Moreover, body weights of female and male WAG/Rij rats were significantly different (Figure 4 and Table 3), but similar control R-βHB and glucose (except between the 15th and 17th months) levels were demonstrated in both sexes (Figures 2A, 3A).",06bb948f-52d8-4487-8a89-5f9fe270a40a
32,discussion6," These results suggest that likely there is no relationship between differences in body weight of female and male animals and alterations in not only the control but also KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT)-evoked changes in blood R-βHB and glucose levels. However, the influence of body weight differences between sexes on KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT)-generated effects cannot be ruled out entirely.  It has been demonstrated that ketosis and changes in the rates of ketone body utilization do not evoke changes in the relatively high activity and amount of ketone body metabolic enzymes in adults . Moreover, short periods of fasting or KD are not able to change blood–brain barrier permeability to ketone bodies likely because prolonged and high ketone body levels are needed for increased transport processes (Hawkins et al., 1971; Nehlig and Pereira de Vasconcelos, 1993; Morris, 2005).",7046271b-8a49-46d0-a22f-95b20515eb02
33,discussion7," Based on these results, administration of exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)s (such as KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT)) once a month for 17 months likely may not be able to change the activity of ketone body metabolic enzymes and blood–brain barrier permeability to ketone bodies. Thus, theoretically, changes in KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT)-evoked increase in blood R-βHB levels by age and differences between female and male rats (Figures 2B,C and Table 1) may result likely from altered expression and activity of ketone body metabolizing enzymes and/or monocarboxylate transporters in different organs between the 1st and 17th months (but not from direct and acute effects of KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) on ketone body metabolism or transport).",90b0b1d5-fdba-4d36-b5cc-6e773faab5e4
34,discussion8," Theoretically, similar to ketone bodies, changes by age and sex in glucose utilization month by month (but not an acute effect) may result in KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT)-generated decrease in blood glucose concentrations (Figure 3B and Table 2). However, more studies are needed to find the exact links between the KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT)-evoked changes in blood R-βHB and glucose levels and changes in the activity of metabolic enzymes and transporters of different organs during aging (as putative background of KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT)-generated effects) in animals with different ages and in both sexes.  The influence of age- and sex-generated effects on glucose and ketone body metabolic enzymes and transporters under normal physiological and pathophysiological conditions, as well as after exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS) administration through a wide age range of rats (month by month), has not been well studied.",2a777733-0fa5-429f-bac1-231ea8283713
35,discussion9," Moreover, actual βHB and glucose levels and utilization may reflect alterations not only in the liver but also in extrahepatic tissues by age (Page et al., 1971; Edmond, 1974), and the mechanism of digestion and absorption of fat (and, theoretically, exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)s) can be changed in the gut by age (Henning and Kretchmer, 1973). Thus, interpretation of our results and the explanation of the complex background processes leading to modulation of KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT)-evoked changes in blood R-βHB and glucose concentrations by age and sex are difficult. However, our results strengthened the conclusions of previous studies above (Hawkins et al., 1971; Page et al., 1971; Merimee et al., 1978; Gerhart et al., 1997; Buc et al.",17dc4c71-d0cf-4a99-b53e-21b7394f00a2
36,discussion10,", 1986), suggesting that (i) ketone body and glucose production and utilization is maintained during the lifetime in rats, which may be modulated by age and sex; (ii) the level of both ketone bodies (R-βHB) and glucose may decrease by age after weaning; and (iii) basal levels of R-βHB and glucose are similar in females and males (Figure 2A, 3A and Tables 1, 2). In addition, our recent study markedly extends the previous results on exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS) administration-generated effects on blood R-βHB and glucose levels pointing out that (i) KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT)-evoked increase in blood R-βHB levels was significant in both sexes over 17 months, compared with the control (Figures 1A,B); (ii) the rate of increase was sex-dependent (Figures 2B,C and Table 1); iii) KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT)-generated effects on blood R-βHB levels changed by age only in male rats,",75c38d79-a88e-4150-a894-d9c632a6cba5
37,discussion11," compared with the baseline (1st month) (Table 1); (iv) KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT) administration not only significantly increased blood R-βHB levels but also significantly decreased the blood glucose levels in both sexes between the 1st and 17th months, compared with the control (Figures 1C,D), suggesting ketosis-induced hypoglycemia; (v) the rate of decrease in blood glucose levels was also sex-dependent (Figure 3B and Table 2); and (vi) KEmedium chain triglyceride (MCT)-generated influences on blood glucose levels changed by age in both sexes, compared with the baseline (1st month) (Table 2). Based on these results, we speculated that various influences could be generated on physiological and pathophysiological processes by the same doses of exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)s via distinct alteration of ketone body and/or glucose levels in males and females at different ages.",9424f76d-3f4e-409e-ac37-70c4004e5618
38,discussion12," However, blood levels of ketone bodies may not accurately reflect their levels in the brain (or in other organs) and their effect (efficacy) on physiological and pathophysiological processes, because ketone body transport could be saturated ; thus, alleviating effects of ketone bodies (ketosis) on different diseases may not be necessarily increased by a higher level of ketosis, for example, in females compared with males (Figure 2B) and in adult males compared with younger ones (Table 1). In addition, a very low level of exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)-evoked ketosis may be ineffective and an exaggerated level of ketone bodies may not only be inefficacious but also harmful. Indeed, our previous study showed that, for example, to evoke an alleviating effect on impaired motor functions, generation of a certain range of blood ketone body levels is needed .",741546ee-85e8-4775-a5f0-4d83e56ca1ab
39,discussion13," However, these results suggest that different doses of exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)s may be needed for safe and effective treatment of different age groups and in both genders.  Conclusion In conclusion, emerging science on metabolic therapies, such as exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)s, suggests the potential of these compounds to enhance quality of life and for the treatment of different neurometabolic and age-related diseases. The present study suggests that the exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)-evoked effects on blood R-βHB and glucose levels may be modulated by both age and sex. Thus, the age- and gender-dependent modulatory effects of exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)s on blood R-βHB (ketosis) and glucose concentrations should be taken into consideration during the administration of metabolic-based therapies for the treatment of different diseases.",31e2cea7-59d6-4759-ad8a-6bb90d216fc7
40,discussion14," Moreover, monitoring of blood ketone body and glucose levels of exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS) users may be important in order to find safe and effective doses of exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)s for different age groups and in both genders. However, further studies are needed to reveal the exact mechanism(s) of action of ketone body and glucose production (metabolism) and utilization during aging and the potential gender-evoked modulatory processes on exogenous ketone (ketogenic) supplement (EKS)-induced blood βHB and glucose levels not only in animals but also in human subjects.
