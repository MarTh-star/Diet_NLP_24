Ethics Approval  The protocol was accepted by the University Hospital Arnau de Vilanova ethics committee (CEIC-1966L) and previously registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT01865448; last access date: 19 December 2021). The clinical trial was carried out in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration and Spanish legislation regarding the protection of personal information. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before their entry into the study. Reporting has followed the CONSORT guideline for randomized trials [18].  2.2. Study Design and Participants  Randomized, controlled, single-center clinical trial that analyzed changes in adventitial VV density and in the biological markers of endothelial dysfunction in patients with moderate obesity undergoing a multidisciplinary, structured program for weight loss using a very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) over a 6-month period.",d6bcb373-a760-4a5f-8b85-d67b544d496f
1,methods1," The study was performed in the Arnau de Vilanova University Hospital in Lleida, Spain. This hospital is a Center of Obesity Management accredited by the European Association for the Study of Obesity. The study was open for recruitment from May 2019 to December 2019, when the target sample size was reached.  The study flow chart is displayed in Figure 1. Eligible participants included men and women aged 18–65 years, with a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) between 35.0 and 39.9 kg/m2. All patients provided written consent confirming their willingness to participate in the study and had to agree to participate in a designed weight loss program.",243eeafe-d7cb-4d50-aace-8888e28e252b
2,methods2," The following exclusion criteria were applied: (i) previous bariatric surgical procedure; (ii) any type of diabetes mellitus at any phase of the study (using the American Diabetes Association criteria); (iii) drug addiction or psychological disturbances including eating disorders or alcoholism; (iv) chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) or liver cirrhosis; (v) history of CV or cerebrovascular disease; (vi) pregnant or breast-feeding women; and (vii) individuals with a known allergy to sulfur hexafluoride ultrasound contrast.  2.3. Interventions  Using the standard deviation of adventitial VV from a previous study, we determined that the minimum necessary sample size was 30 subjects [19]. Therefore, patients were randomized 2:1 into two groups to receive either a commercially available very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) (n = 20) or a standard-of-care approach based on the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet, n = 10) for weight loss purposes.",59516fa7-1ea3-448e-8403-2a6e9951e230
3,methods3," Random allocation was done by an external company using a computer-generated randomization list. All individuals underwent clinical assessment by a specialist endocrinologist and dietitian each month throughout the course of the study. Aiming for congruency between both groups, adequate dietary habits, and intense physical activity indications (140 to 280 min weekly) were provided by expert support staff.  The very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) group completed a diet according to the PNK® Method, a commercial weight loss program based on a high biological value protein preparation [20]. Each protein preparation contained 15 g protein, 4 g carbohydrates, 3 g fat, and provided 90–100 kcal. The very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) arm was supplemented with 500 mg/day docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) [20]. During the firsts three months of the treatment period patients were kept in ketosis (“active stage”) of the method.",bcbbe45f-9c4d-45a6-aa9d-c2c01c7997c7
4,methods4," This stage consists of a very low carbohydrate (<50 g daily from vegetables with a low glycemic index), very low calorie (600–800 kcal/day), and very low fat (only 10 g of extra virgin olive oil per day) diet. The quantity of high-biological-value proteins was between 0.8 and 1.2 g per kilogram ideal body weight, to cover minimum body requirements and to avoid the loss of fat-free mass. Supplements of vitamins and minerals, including potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (docosahexaenoic acid) were provided according to international recommendations [21]. This active stage was followed by a 2-month very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) in which one of the protein servings was substituted with a natural protein (e.g., meat or fish). Finally, a 1-month controlled diet in which a second serving of low-fat natural protein was substituted for the second serving of biological protein preparation. These timings were personalized for each patient.",167145d3-d608-4286-8889-f4e1a697aa86
5,methods5,"  Participants allocated to the standard hypocaloric diet (estimated reduction of 500 kcal on the usual intake) based on the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) followed the same monthly visits as the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) group. MedDiet consisted of 50% carbohydrates (including whole grains and vegetables), approximately 15% protein, and 35% fat (including extra virgin olive oil and nuts).  Finally, 20 subjects with normal weight or overweight (body mass index (BMI) 24.2 ± 2.0 kg/m2) were used as a baseline control group only for the evaluation of the adventitial VV density. Those individuals were matched for sex and age (±2 years) with the global interventional group.  2.4. Contrast-Enhanced Carotid Ultrasound  Contrast-enhanced carotid ultrasound was performed using the Siemens Sequoia 512 ultrasound system, equipped with a 15L8W linear array probe and with ultrasound contrast software (Cadence contrast Pulse Sequencing technology).",551678ec-0d2e-4ac0-8194-ee45d85d1c79
6,methods6," A phospholipidic shell containing sulfur hexafluoride (Sonovue, Bracco Spa, Milan, Italy) was used as the contrast agent. Full technical details have been described previously [13,22]. Results are displayed for the right and left sides, and the mean VV signal was calculated for the 2 sides. All ultrasound studies were stored digitally for retrospective analysis and were quantified by a blinded investigator. Baseline evaluation was followed by a repeat evaluation 6 months after the nutritional intervention.  2.5. Body Composition, Anthropometric Data, and Quality-of-Life Evaluation  Body composition at baseline and after 6 months of follow-up was analyzed using a segmental body composition device (Tanita MC-580, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Weight and height were estimated in light clothing and without shoes using standard equipment, to the nearest 0.5 kg and 1.0 cm, respectively. body mass index (BMI) was defined as the body weight (kg) divided by the square of the body height (m).",28d370c2-2e59-4923-b03b-8a52237b9664
7,methods7," Waist circumference was measured with the participant in a standing position, using a non-elastic tape with an accuracy of 0.1 cm places in the horizontal plane between the iliac crest and the lowest rib. To avoid inter-observer and inter-device variability, all measurements were taken by a single experienced investigator using the same devices.  The Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQOL-Lite) was administered to quantitatively assess the individual’s perception of how weight affected their day-to-day life [23]. This questionnaire comprises 31 items grouped into 5 dimensions: physical functioning, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress, and work. The measure provides scores for each dimension and a total score.  2.6. Laboratory Assessment  Blood samples were taken by direct puncture of the antecubital vein after an overnight fast of 8 h and just before administration of the contrast agent. Blood samples were separated by centrifugation (2.",299b1b8f-ed6c-4b13-93c5-883eddf51e92

The atherogenic index of plasma (atherogenic index of plasma (AIP)), which is considered a significant predictor of CV risk, was calculated as the logarithmically transformed ratio of molar concentrations of triglycerides to HDL-cholesterol [24]. The triglyceride-glucose index, a novel biomarker that has been associated with morphological characteristics of the atheroma plaque and CV events, was also measured [25]. Finally, serum concentrations of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1) were measured on serum samples. All measurements were made in duplicate using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) kit, following the instructions of manufacturer (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).  2.7.",7563e35a-cfc5-4d19-8608-9205f10a7e7f
9,methods9," Statistical Analysis  A normal distribution of the variables was established using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and data were expressed as the mean ± SD or as percentages. The main clinical data across the three groups were compared using Student’s t-test or the ANOVA test for continuous variables. Pearson’s chi-squared test was used for categorical data. In addition, the relationship between continuous variables was assessed using the Pearson correlation test. Changes in the biomarkers and other parameters were evaluated using a paired t-test. For this exploratory pilot study to prove a concept, we did not perform a power analysis to estimate sample sizes.  All p values were based on a 2-sided test for statistical significance. Significance was accepted as a p value less than 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27, Armonk, NY, USA).  3.",05bca0c8-f9f2-45f0-a0a8-1d316da9206e
10,methods10," Results  At baseline, no significant differences were observed between the intervention groups (very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) and MedDiet) regarding age, sex, anthropometry, clinical and metabolic parameters, and quality of life (Table 1).  Although adventitial VV density was significantly lower in subjects with normal weight or overweight in comparison with participants with moderate obesity, no differences were observed (mean, left and right sides) between the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) and MedDiet groups at baseline (Table 1, Figure 2). Similarly, at baseline, no intergroup differences were observed in the biological markers of endothelial dysfunction (Table 1).  After a follow-up period of 6 months, participants allocated to the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) group, in comparison with the MedDiet group, experienced a significant decrease in their body mass index (BMI) (−5.2 kg/m2 [95% confidence interval (CI) −8.3 to −2.0 kg/m2], p = 0.",397efb0b-a7a1-4981-997c-979bc0b2603c
11,methods12," However, at the end of the follow-up period, participants in the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) group showed a significant fall in the serum concentration of ICAM-1 in comparison with the MedDiet group (−60.9 [95% CI −115.0 to −6.8] ng/mL, p = 0.029). In addition, there was a significant decrease in the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) between baseline and the end of the study in the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) group (Table 4). sVCAM-1 showed no treatment effect in either group.  Finally, two patients in the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) group reported adverse events, mainly affecting gastrointestinal system. Both patients were finally excluded from the study. Furthermore, one patient in the MedDiet group reported a serious adverse event. This event was a non-fatal episode of heart failure that required hospitalization for 3 days, and which resolved after treatment with beta-blockers.  4.",29d5c9cc-39cb-4293-8d2b-fcb320567b70
12,methods13," Discussion  The link between obesity and CV diseases is well recognized and is predominantly related to increased adiposity. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. This study was therefore designed to investigate the morphological changes in the carotid arterial wall induced by different weight-loss interventions in subjects with moderate obesity. Our data support the hypothesis that a short period of 6 months is insufficient to induce morphological changes in the carotid wall, but that such interventions can produce improvements in the serological markers of endothelial dysfunction, such as ICAM-1, and in the lipid-based atherogenic indices. These positive findings may be related to a 5-point reduction in the body mass index (BMI) and an almost 6% reduction in total body fat.",f1fd3678-a49f-4211-9aaa-f49c982a151b
13,methods14," The very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD), as a part of a multicomponent strategy and under strict medical supervision, is an effective plan for the treatment of obesity [15,16] and type 2 diabetes [26,27]. Although some reports suggest that ketogenic diets have been associated with higher CV risk [17], our data do not support this hypothesis and show a positive safety profile with this weight loss approach.  The VV nourish the wall of medium and large arteries [28]. However, their proliferation is seen in the initial stages of atherosclerosis. In pigs fed with a high-fat diet, VV proliferation was detected before the development of intimal thickening and even before the onset of endothelial dysfunction [29]. This discovery suggests that factors other than intimal hypoxia, such as a dysfunctional perivascular adipose tissue, may promote VV proliferation in the atheromatous process [30,31].",98fdd0a3-2766-494e-af4a-0607e6a90248
14,methods15," In obesity, adipocytokines from the perivascular adipose tissue promote adventitial inflammation, neovascularization, and neointima formation, playing a key role in the pathogenesis of atheromatous changes; the VV may transport inflammatory cells between the neointima and the perivascular adipose tissue [32]. Previous research by our group showed that neovascularization, measured by adventitial VV density, was higher in patients with morbid obesity than in normal weight subjects [13]. This increase in VV density was especially high among subjects with sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome, reinforcing the role of nocturnal hypoxia in the genesis of atheromatous disease [33]. It has been also shown that adventitial VV density decreases significantly 6 and 12 months after bariatric surgery [13,22]. However, the present study found no effect on VV density after a 6-month weight-loss intervention with a very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) or MedDiet.",fa8557b9-6cd3-4e6b-94ba-a345896830ef
15,methods16," This lack of effect may be due in part to the short follow-up period, the lower baseline body mass index (BMI), and the smaller reduction in body mass index (BMI) than occurred in the studies with bariatric surgery [13,22].  very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) has been proposed as an effective weight loss method for patients with obesity [15,16], including its use in the preoperative setting for bariatric surgery [34]; it has even been included in the preoperative consensus statement from the Italian Society of Endocrinology [27]. Our results agree with previous studies comparing the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) with a hypocaloric diet based on the MedDiet, showing very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) to be associated with marked reductions not only in body mass index (BMI), but also in total body fat and waist circumference, all of which are related to the incidence of CV disease [35,36,37].",1488ed44-2fc6-4944-b7b5-77a53f26fa02
16,methods17," It has been suggested that nutritional ketosis and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation may be added to the greater weight loss as responsible for these beneficial effects [15,20,38]. Dietary carbohydrate restriction increases the production of the ketone body ß-hydroxybutyrate, shifting tissue cross-talk from a proinflammatory to an anti-atherogenic environment, addressing the residual inflammatory risk and reducing most of the atherosclerotic CV disease biomarkers [39]. The nutraceutical supplementation of very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) with commercially available docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) produces both vaso- and cardioprotective responses that have been widely demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo [40]. In addition, very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD)s have also been associated with reductions in visceral adiposity, at a rate of 505 g/week [41].",0ab05dfb-a528-4279-bd92-a76ec87579a9
17,methods18," It must be highlighted that the loss of weight and fat mass in our study were achieved without changes in fat-free mass, avoiding the risk of sarcopenia-related physical disability, frailty, poor quality of life, and mortality [42,43,44]. In point of fact, a significant improvement in quality of life was reported by participants in the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) group in our study. Similar data have previously been reported in the physical function and self-esteem scores [45]. We also observed improvements in sexual life and public distress.  Finally, we observed a marked fall in the serum concentration of sICAM-1, though not of sVCAM-1, in the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) group in our study, as well as a significant decrease in the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP). These effects are consistent with the findings in other studies [46]. sICAM-1 appears to be an earlier marker of endothelial injury than sVCAM-1 [47].",0d2bfdf2-fbe3-463f-a9cb-2a9ec611b69e
18,methods19," This information has been clearly established by prospective studies with several years of follow-up [48,49]. Consequently, we suggest that 6 months of a very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) in subjects with moderate obesity and without previous CV disease is sufficient to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction associated with obesity. Further studies are needed to determine whether a longer period of time or greater weight loss could provoke positive changes in the adventitial VV density.  This study has certain limitations. The number of participants in each arm of the study was small for which our conclusions need to be replicated in the future in larger studies. Other relevant information that could influence the results, such as menopausal status, was not available in our study [50]. The gold standards for the assessment of body adiposity are dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging [51,52].",5f22ac4b-1fae-4bf6-93c0-b23267e54d74
19,methods20," However, previous studies have reported similar results using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, multifrequency bioelectrical impedance, and air displacement plethysmography [15]. In addition, a longer follow-up period would improve our data. Finally, the two interventions were not compared in an iso-caloric manner.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, a 6-month intervention with a very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) did not impact the density of the adventitial VV in subjects with moderate obesity, though it did produce a reduction in markers of endothelial dysfunction and of atheromatous disease. These results are associated with a marked decrease in body weight and total body fat, without affecting fat-free mass, compared with hypocaloric diets based on the MedDiet. VV measurement is complex and time-consuming. We recommend monitoring sICAM-1 levels in subjects with obesity to achieve a better classification of CV risk. ",02f9df17-173b-4f49-80a6-e099066f986e
