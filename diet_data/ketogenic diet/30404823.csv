1,methods1, The following keywords were used: (“ketogenic” OR “ketosis” OR “keto diet” OR “ketoacid” OR ketogenesis”) AND (“status epilepticus” OR “long adj3 seizure” OR “continuous adj3 seizure” OR “unremitting adj3 seizure” OR “nonconvulsive adj3 seizure” OR “Kojevnikov epileps” OR “Kojevnikov syndrome” OR “Kozhevnikov epileps” OR “Kozhevnikov syndrome” OR “generalized convulsive SE” OR “petit mal status” OR “absence status” OR “subtle SE” OR “nonconvulsive SE” OR “absence SE” OR “complex partial SE” OR “simple partial SE” OR “prolong adj3 seizure”). The keywords used in the study were chosen in conjunction with a library information specialist to ensure a comprehensive search that covered variations in the KD and condition subtypes. The reference lists of the included articles were also searched manually to find additional eligible articles. Search was undertaken by SHM and EH.  2.2 Study selection Studies were selected based on the reported use of the KD in adult patients with SE.,dae399b0-ad3f-48e4-8d31-38c229645944
2,methods2," All study designs and outcomes related to cessation of SE were included. Nonrelevant studies, non–English‐language studies that could not be translated using Google Translate, nonhuman studies, commentaries, opinion articles, editorials, and review articles were excluded after title and abstract screening. The full‐text screening of the remaining articles was conducted to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the systematic review as depicted in Figure 2. Study selection was undertaken by SHM and EH. In case of any discrepancies between the authors, further discussion was done to reach a consensus.

3,methods3," When available, KD ratio (fats: carbohydrate, proteins), etiology, reported side effects, order of initiation, time from SE onset to KD initiation, time to ketosis, and time to SE control in KD responders were also collected. Outcome data collected included KD success in resolving SE, posttreatment information, and adverse reactions attributed to KD use. Individual articles were critically appraised using Joanna Briggs Institute (Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI)) Appraisal Checklists. The appropriate checklist was selected based on the study design.13 The overall level of evidence was graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE)) working group criteria.14 Data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by all authors.  3 ",17c090b8-5dd2-42ba-bbab-d84b9fc7d5d3

19,discussion0," 4.1 Effectiveness of KD in adults with SE KD use in adult patients with superrefractory status epilepticus (superrefractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE))) has been reported in a single prospective multicenter observational study.4 KD was initiated in 15 adult patients with superrefractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)) with varied etiologies (Table 1). The primary outcome measure was the development of ketosis defined as urine acetoacetate ≥40 mg/dL and/or serum β‐hydroxybutyrate ≥2 mmol/L. Other outcomes included resolution of superrefractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)) and Glasgow Coma Scale (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge. One patient was withdrawn from the study following KD initiation. The number of antiepileptic drug (AED)s used before KD initiation ranged from 5 to 12, and the time from SE onset to KD initiation ranged from 2 to 39 days.",fe6db876-8ea7-44d9-b6af-e066fee7e138
20,discussion1," Ketosis was achieved in all patients with median time to ketosis of 2 days (IQR 1). KD was successful in achieving superrefractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)) resolution in 11 Patients (73%). The authors concluded that KD might be a safe and effective option in adult patients with superrefractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)). Francis et al have reported similar rates of effectiveness (73%) in a retrospective study of 11 adult patients with refractory status epilepticus (RSE).15 However, in this study, KD was initiated early throughout the disease course (time from SE onset to KD initiation ranged from 0 to 3 days) suggesting possible effectiveness of KD early on in the disease course. Similarly, Thakur et al have reported a successful use of KD in 10 adult patients with superrefractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)). KD was successful in achieving cessation of SE in all the patients.",d3d19397-ade6-477b-a945-67a207dbd914
21,discussion2,"16 In addition, a retrospective study by Park et al reporting a mixed cohort (adults and pediatrics) of patients treated with KD has reported two adult patients who were successfully treated with KD.17   Taken together, based on the observational studies described above, a total of 38 Patients with refractory status epilepticus (RSE)/superrefractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)) have been reported. KD was successful in achieving cessation of SE in 31 Patients (82%), suggesting a potential role of KD in the management of SE. The rates of KD reported in adults were similar to those reported in pediatric SE. Nine retrospective studies specifically looked at the effectiveness of KD in pediatrics for SE.",f8f1e207-45e9-4945-969e-26f399c4f577
22,discussion3,"5, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 A total of 85 Patients, 36 (42%) were males, were put on the KD for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) and superrefractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)), and it was effective in 64 (75%).  In addition to the above‐mentioned studies, there were 13 case reports and series that reported KD use in a total of 17 adult patients, six of those reported male.6, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 The age of patients ranged from 19 to 58 years. There were four Patients with a reported history of seizures/epilepsy. The number of reported antiepileptic drug (AED)s tried before initiating KD, not including anesthetics and immunomodulators, ranged from 3 to 16. The reported time from SE onset to KD initiation ranged from 3 to 155 days, number of days to achieve ketosis ranged from 3.5 to 37 days, and the time to SE resolution ranged from 4 to 25 days.",dd37a975-878b-4f99-b627-a3999db2afe9
23,discussion4," The KD was successful in 14 Patients for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) and superrefractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)) (82%). It is worth noting that the patient in the case report by Uchida et al achieved resolution of superrefractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)) with both KD and stiripentol.35   Although promising, the results need to be interpreted with caution due to the inherent bias, confounding and small sample size of the included studies. A multicenter randomized controlled trial is recommended to determine the role of KD in the management of SE in adults.  4.2 Safety of KD in adults with SE Safety of KD diet in critically ill patients with SE is another important aspect to consider. In patients with refractory epilepsy, KD is generally well tolerated with reported adverse effects such as gastrointestinal symptoms, metabolic acidosis, nephrolithiasis, and increased propensity to infections.",8bb337e5-d274-4700-bb65-c0c7ef20602c
24,discussion5,"37 Five of the studies used in this review reported adverse effects from KD.4, 15, 16, 17, 34 The most common adverse effects reported in the reviewed studies were metabolic acidosis, hyperlipidemia, and hypoglycemia. Metabolic acidosis in some patients was reported to be persistent despite administration of bicarbonate therapy and resulting in KD discontinuation. This suggests the need for careful monitoring of adverse effects when KD is being utilized. It should be noted that none of the studies which reported adverse effects contained defining parameters for each of the stated adverse effects.  One important additional safety aspect of KD was the possible interaction between KD and propofol. Concomitant administration of KD and propofol might potentially increase the risk of propofol infusion syndrome. A case of fatal propofol infusion syndrome in 10 years old boy has been reported in the literature.",51bc6291-f190-4cb3-b1f3-0259ddafa803
25,discussion6,"38 Although there is no sufficient evidence to support or refute this possible interaction, the cumulative effects of propofol and KD on metabolic derangements (altered fatty acid oxidation) suggest avoiding propofol in patients treated with KD. Propofol therapy was one of the main reasons for the reported delay in KD initiation.  4.3 KD administration protocols in adults with SE KD ratio of 4:1 of fats to nonketogenic proteins and carbohydrates was the most commonly reported regimen in adult patients (Tables 1 and 2). In contrast, pediatric SE studies have reported other regimens in addition to the 4:1 ratio such as 3:118, 20, 21, 24, 39, 5:15, 18, 6:140, 1:1, 2:1, 2.75:1, 3.2:1, 3.5:1, and 4.5:118, 20, 21, 37. In addition, less restrictive forms of the KD have been used to successfully induce ketone body production, such as the modified Atkins diet (modified Atkins diet (MAD)) in Kumada et al and a low‐glycemic index diet (low‐glycemic index diet (LGIT)) in Martikainen et al30, 41.",6220305e-7061-4406-8141-114cb0a785e5
26,discussion7," A challenging aspect of KD therapy is the need to achieve ketosis to produce antiepileptogenic ketone bodies. In the reported studies, it can take up to 37 days to achieve sustained ketosis. The presence of carbohydrates that are commonly found in medications and intravenous fluids can potentially prolong the time for ketone body production. Obtaining a pharmacist consult to limit carbohydrates in fluids and administered medications is essential.  Two studies have reported the detailed standardized KD treatment protocols (Table 4).4, 15 Baseline steps, contraindications, KD regimen administration, and monitoring were very comparable. The median time to ketosis in both studies was 1‐2 days, with ketosis achieved in 25/26 Patients (96%) suggesting the potential success of these standardized protocols as opposed to earlier case reports where time to ketosis was at least 3.5 days.",2ba25ad1-1870-4981-91e5-aa1d4bb00b54

Case reports and case series have a strong bias toward only reporting positive outcomes.",c26ab7b0-2f88-44bb-b9c8-82f75352e462
29,discussion10," Additionally, there is a bias of attributing SE resolution to the last treatment tried when prior administered treatments, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)) or corticosteroids, may have produced a delayed response. Therefore, it is not clear if the reported KD effectiveness is attributed to KD or due to the concomitant management. In addition, there was considerable heterogeneity in patient characteristics, SE etiologies, definition of effectiveness, and time from SE onset to KD initiation. Furthermore, the definition of ketosis varied among studies; however, most of the reports agreed that persistence of urinary ketones is an indication of ketosis. As seen in Tables 1 and 2, SE etiologies have varied, and it seems that there is no sufficient sample size to associate effectiveness of KD in cessation of SE to a certain SE etiology.",61764ac1-f8fa-4a6b-873d-9f5d416d6642
30,discussion11," There were no randomized controlled trials identified that specifically looked at the KD in treating acute SE which greatly decreases the strength of evidence. Based on the critical analysis of the included evidence, the current evidence is not sufficient enough to conduct a metaanalysis and produce a point estimate.  5 ",836d3ea7-52ce-41e6-a2fa-8c6b7bf9567e
31,conclusion0,The current evidence suggests that KD might be considered as an option for adult patients with SE especially in those with superrefractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)). A multicenter randomized controlled trial is recommended to establish role of KD in the management of SE in adults.  DISCLOSURE None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose.
