0,introduction0,"Type two diabetes is considered one of the major contributors to morbidity and mortality in the developed world. It is a serious public health problem with a growing prevalence, where more than 380-million patients will have the disease by 2025 [1]. Patients with type two diabetes have a lower life expectancy, higher risk of developing heart disease, diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy as compared to the general population [2]. It is, therefore, a subject of extensive research to develop medications and adjunctive treatments to reduce the negative impact of the disease on patients [3]. Among the treatment options being investigated is the ketogenic diet.  The word ketogenic is a term for a low carbohydrate and high-fat diet. The idea of a ketogenic diet is to consume more calories from fat and less from carbohydrates in order to shift the basis of energy production from glucose to ketone bodies created from fat breakdown [4].",af0a319b-0650-4ba2-8659-f950f2ffcec3
1,introduction1," Side effects are usually mild and short in duration like headache, diarrhea, frequent urination, sweating, fatigue, hunger, anxiety and/or irritability, tachycardia, lightheadedness, and shakiness [5]. In the past, the use of the diet was for the treatment of refractory seizures in children. Today, the diet is studied for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cancer [6].  The ketogenic diet has a noticeable effect on diabetic patients, in particular, showing decreased bodyweight, improved fasting glucose level, improved fasting insulin level, decreased cholesterol level, and diabetic medication elimination/reduction. This is hypothesized to be due to the reduction in carbohydrate intake, leading to reduced blood glucose and shifting the basic metabolism of energy from glucose to ketone bodies. This decrease in blood glucose leads to improved insulin resistance as well [7].  Many studies showed this effect of the ketogenic diet on weight loss.",f7a2c7ac-0b13-4659-891f-32f2a02afc02
2,introduction2," One such is a review that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)) to compare the effects of a ketogenic diet with a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet. The results demonstrated that weight loss was greater with the low carbohydrate diet as compared to the low-fat diet. Although patients following either dietary method lost significant fat mass, patients who followed the ketogenic diet had more reduction in serum triglyceride levels and greater increases in high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) cholesterol level as compared to the low-fat diet. This result demonstrates that the ketogenic diet can be used as an intervention for obesity and diabetes and illustrated the importance of further research into the effects of the diet [8].  For this, the objective of this review is to search, summarize, and report the effects of the ketogenic diet on glycemic control in patients with type two diabetes.",33025338-ee08-463e-a581-f1c8f173f005
3,introduction3, A secondary objective is to assess the lipid profile on a high-fat diet and to what extent will it be elevated. ,30658571-c0e9-46a7-a255-849fb457bd27
4,methods0," This review looks at the published literature and summarizes the interventional trials that use the ketogenic diet for glycemic control. Emphasis was on pooling the results of selected variables such as weight, glycemic control, and lipid profile. The meta-analysis was conducted by a trained statistician using the Cochrane software review manager (Revman version 5.4; Cochrane, London, UK). Results were reviewed by an independent reviewer adhering to the Cochrane Collaboration's guidelines.  An Ovid database search was performed covering the literature published between January 2000 and July 2020. Studies were included if they met the criteria of being clinical trials, studying an adult sample of patients with type two diabetes. Studies were excluded from the meta-analysis if there was no control group. Studies with samples mixing diabetic patients with non-diabetic patients were included but the analysis was performed on the diabetic patients subgroups only.",ce8bec8f-320d-43ae-906e-161571184b8c

21,discussion0,"The results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that the ketogenic diet is an effective tool to reduce weight, provide glycemic control, and improve the lipid profile as compared to controls. However, heterogeneity is evident in the analysis of the included variables in this review. The extent of heterogeneity is significant and, in some parameters, reached 98%. This is not uncommon in studies with small sample sizes and not uncommon as well in studies with non-uniform control like aggregating the results of slightly differing diets such as the ones included as controls in this review. Therefore, the heterogeneity of the included studies should be taken into consideration, but it is the opinion of this review that this should not influence clinical decision-making since the general results discussed in the individual studies demonstrate the superiority of the ketogenic diet as compared to the individual control comparisons irrespective of the heterogeneity in the pooled effect.",f5326372-e6cd-43a8-9c85-f3494b01ae3b
22,discussion1," The non-uniform controls could be the cause of the significant heterogeneity. Thus the results can be taken into clinical practice with no issues due to the positive trend in individual studies and concurrently in the pooled effect favoring the ketogenic diet.  It is worth noting as well that the published literature lacks studies with long-term follow-up for more than two years [15]. Longer follow-up is essential to ascertain the safety and reliability of the diet to maintain weight control, glucose control, and lipid profile control. More significantly, long-term follow-up is necessary to establish the potential harm of the diet if there is one and to what extent the said harm is present.",5c8dc1a7-e718-436e-a920-5ac2612c26ca
23,discussion2," Although there is a review of the potential therapeutic effects of the diet published in 2013, showing that it is safe in long-term use for the heart and kidneys and other systems [16], this is insufficient to recommend using the diet in the long term given the lack of long-term, large-scale prospective studies to document side-effects and demonstrate the safety profile of this diet. Thus, for the purposes of this review, the diet can safely be used, as per the latest published literature, for two years without the worry of side-effects in diabetic patients. However, a case report published in 2020 showed a serious potential side-effect of the ketogenic diet with induced fatty liver disease and elevated cholesterol and liver enzymes in a 57-year-old patient with binge eating and anxiety disorders [17].",f52b499c-a199-4a4f-86f1-59c7597de838
24,discussion3," Although this finding could be due to the patient's lifestyle prior to starting the two months trial, ruling out the ketogenic diet as a potential cause requires more studies of longer duration to ascertain the safety of the diet long term.  The findings of this review show that the effect on the lipid profile is although profound, counterintuitive given that the diet relies on fat as a source of energy. It was assumed at the beginning of this review that the lipid profile will increase due to the increase in fat consumption. However, this assumption was rejected after the analysis showed the opposite effect taking place. This result is worth further investigation to expand on the knowledge of the mechanisms leading to an elevated lipid profile in diabetic and obese patients.",a40ca73f-38b5-488d-b5f9-e1e60d693d06
25,discussion4," An explanation for the improved lipid profile is necessary and the mechanism needs revision since the status quo is that increasing fat intake has a direct effect in increasing the lipid profile, which is contrary to the findings of this review [18].  Conclusions The ketogenic diet showed a significant improvement in glycemic control in all studies included in this review and demonstrated a significantly improved lipid profile, including an increase in high-density lipoprotein as compared to control. Although the heterogeneity of the studies cannot be ignored, this review shows clearly that the ketogenic diet, although high in fat by definition, showed a significant and important lipid profile control coupled with weight loss and effective glycemic control. This is consistent with the effect seen in individual studies and confirmed in the aggregate effect estimate.",34c26add-8db0-4c86-bbf6-3d925eaca736
