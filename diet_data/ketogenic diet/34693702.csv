0,abstract0," Extracellular vesicles have emerged as a less-invasive nano-tool for discovering biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia. Here, we analysed different neuron-enriched extracellular vesicles from plasma to predict response and molecular mechanisms of ketogenic diet’s efficacy in mild cognitive impairment participants. The study was a randomized crossover design in which cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment participants consumed a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet or American Heart Association diet for 6 weeks, followed by other diet after washout. L1 cell adhesion molecule, synaptophysin and neural cell adhesion molecule surface markers were used to enrich for neuron-secreted small extracellular vesicles (sEVL1CAM, sEVsynaptophysin (SYP) and sEVneural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)).",813f71c7-8272-4ec2-8903-a26681242a52
1,abstract1," For the first time, we have presented multiple evidences, including immunogold labelling/transmission electron microscopy, clusters of differentiation 63-ELISA-based assay, confocal microscopy fluorescent images and flow cytometry data confirming the presence of L1 cell adhesion molecule on the surface of sEVL1CAM, validating purity and relative abundance of sEVL1CAM in the plasma. Cargo analysis of sEVL1CAM showed that modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet intervention reduces amyloid beta 1–42 (50.3%, P = 0.011), p181-tau (34.9%, P = 0.033) and neurofilament light (54.2%, P = 0.020) in mild cognitive impairment participants. Moreover, sEVL1CAMshowed better sensitivity compared with CSF in analysing increased glutamate (6-folds, P < 0.0001) from mild cognitive impairment participants following modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet intervention.",80f11101-7145-4364-96c0-667fda0574ef
2,abstract2," sEVL1CAM characterization also suggested that modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet differentially targets the expression of various glutamate receptors—glutamate receptor ionotropic NMDA1, glutamate receptor ionotropic NMDA2A, glutamate receptor ionotropic NMDA2B and glutamate receptor ionotropic AMPA type subunit 1. Importantly, these sEVL1CAM measures strongly correlated with corresponding clinical CSF biomarkers (neurogranin, amyloid beta 1–42, neurofilament light and tau). Furthermore, sEVL1CAM were loaded with less advanced glycation endproducts and exhibited anti-inflammatory activity following modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet intervention. Most importantly, the expression of monocarboxylate transporter 2 on the surface of sEVL1CAM predicted the amyloid beta 1–42 response to modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet intervention (area under the curve = 0.87, P = 0.0044) and offered a novel screening tool to identify participants responsive to this dietary intervention.",b8d8c96f-5e7d-4e22-90f8-e83896bfac89
3,abstract3," Finally, sEVL1CAM, sEVsynaptophysin (SYP) and sEVneural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) showed significantly high concordance in analysing amyloid beta 1–42 (Pearson correlation coefficient ≥ 0.63, P < 0.01) and neurofilament light (Pearson correlation coefficient ≥ 0.49, P < 0.05). Together, small extracellular vesicles in plasma offers promise in assessing the efficacy of dietary/therapeutic intervention against mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer’s disease.  Kumar et al. analysed the neuronal-enriched small extracellular vesicles (neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE)) from plasma to demonstrate the effect of modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet in reducing Alzheimer’s disease-related biomarkers, altering glutamate and glutamate receptors and reducing inflammatory response. The present study supports the usefulness of neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) in developing novel preventive/therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer’s disease.",822ad0ab-173d-4aee-b743-b7171f3ac5e2
4,abstract6,"2 Though the precise mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of the KD are not fully elucidated, candidates like reduction of neuronal hyperexcitability through glutamatergic and amyloid-beta (Aβ) inhibition and KD-mediated reduction of oxidative stress, advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) and neuroinflammation have been suggested to play a critical role.3–8 For example, in Alzheimer’s disease, Aβ oligomers interfere with glutamate receptors in the synapses and increase the spillover of glutamate, activating glutamate receptors in the extra-synaptic sites, which in turn activate apoptotic and necrotic pathways.9,10 Preclinical studies provide ample evidence that elevating ketone bodies regulate Aβ levels.11–13 The 3xTgAD mice treated with a ketone-inducing intervention showed less amyloid and/or tau pathology and improved memory performance.",a49660c7-b70b-42ab-a5f4-9d2d0f4eed4d
5,abstract7,"11,12 Ketones reduce Aβ neurotoxicity by blocking its entry into neurons and decreasing amyloid aggregation, with associated improvement in memory.13  Monocarboxylate transporters (monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)s) are responsible for the transport of pyruvate, lactate as well as ketone bodies across the blood–brain barrier. An monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) subtype, monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)2, has a higher affinity for ketone substrate compared with monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1 and 4 and is expressed at a higher level in cells where rapid uptake is required at low substrate concentration.14 Several studies have examined the effects of elevating ketones with medium-chain triglyceride supplements in Alzheimer’s disease.",2a87bb64-f933-4880-a385-600905488372
6,abstract8,"3,15,16 Recently, we reported the results of a pilot clinical study where we compared the effect of a high-fat and low-carbohydrate modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD)) and a low-fat American Heart Association diet (American Heart Association diet (AHAD)) on 11 cognitively normal (CN) older adults and 9 adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)).17 Outcomes showed that modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) was well-tolerated and associated with increased CSF Aβ1–42 and decreased tau levels.17 Also, there was increased cerebral perfusion and increased cerebral ketone body uptake accessed by 11C-acetoacetate PET following modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) intervention.17 Several studies have also suggested that KD targets multiple pathways to inhibit inflammation.",cafb6e40-cf3c-4f2b-abc7-32fdf6d9f4de
7,abstract9,"18,19 These studies suggest a potential therapeutic role of the KD in Alzheimer’s disease but are limited in identifying potential molecular targets and mechanisms of action of beneficial effect. Moreover, the molecular effects of the KD diet are not well defined in humans, mainly due to a lack of access to brain tissue. The identification of molecular mechanisms underlying KD diet efficacy would be helpful in establishing this approach as an ‘evidence-based’ intervention against Alzheimer’s disease. Extracellular vesicles (EV) in the peripheral blood could be potentially useful in understanding the molecular and pathophysiological state of neuronal cells.  EV are lipid-bound vesicles secreted by cells into the extracellular space, which play a key role in intercellular communication and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. EV are quite heterogeneous and can be subcategorized based upon their biogenesis and release pathway, size, content and functions.",315abb2f-a45b-40c6-8b09-c968dfdb3c5f
8,abstract10," Exosomes (∼30–150 nm) are small EV (sEV) of endocytic origin, while microvesicles (100 nm ≥ 1 μm) bud directly from the plasma membrane. Isolation of cell type-specific EV from plasma has garnered much attention in accessing the pathophysiological state of the ‘difficult to access’ cells/tissues. Recently, the discovery of neuronal EV in plasma has led to studies examining their role as ‘liquid biopsies’ for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (and related dementias (ADRD)).20–29 For example, Fiandaca et al. reported that a combination of p181-tau, p-S396-tau and Aβ1–42 contained within neuronal EV could predict the development of Alzheimer’s disease up to 10 years before the clinical onset.28 Another study showed that abnormal plasma neuronal EV levels of p-tau, Aβ1–42, neurogranin (Ng) and repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor accurately predicted the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s disease.",15945b81-c084-464d-976d-22a3540d12f2
9,abstract11,"21 Similarly, auto-lysosomal protein levels,27 transcription factors30 and phosphorylated forms of insulin receptor substrate20 in neuronal EV have also correctly distinguished 100% of participants with Alzheimer’s disease from normal controls. Recently, neuronal EV isolated from plasma have also shown the potential of identifying the efficacy of an antidepressant drug on major depressive disorder subjects.31 Though L1CAM has been extensively used for the isolation/enrichment of neuronal EV, the specificity, validity and even its presence on sEV surface have been questioned.32 Other concerns like the amount of surface biomarkers on neuronal EV in plasma, the percentage of neuronal EV in the blood, their CNS origin, and most importantly, the potential of neuronal EV to assess the treatment response of conventional/interventional therapies still need to be addressed.",2b9b6763-a0c3-4ebb-9929-7e060546c372
10,abstract12,"  In the present manuscript, utilizing archived plasma from the above-mentioned pilot clinical study,17 we isolated and characterized neuronal-enriched sEV (neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE)) using different surface markers like L1CAM, synaptophysin (synaptophysin (SYP)) and neural cell adhesion molecule (neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)), denoted as sEVL1CAM, sEVsynaptophysin (SYP) and sEVneural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), respectively. We analysed the levels of various and related dementias (ADRD) markers i.e. Aβ1–42, total-tau, p181-tau and neurofilament light (NfL), in sEVL1CAMbefore and after modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) and American Heart Association diet (AHAD) intervention. To understand the potential molecular effects of these dietary interventions, we also assessed the expression of different glutamate receptors, glutamate, AGEs and pro-inflammatory effect of sEVL1CAM in an ex vivo assay.",67ffee72-d302-4573-b2c9-d5bf3a57ba9e
11,abstract13," Lastly, we validated a few of the results observed in sEVL1CAM (such as Aβ1–42 and NfL expression) in neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) isolated using other surface markers (synaptophysin and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)). Results demonstrate neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) utility in understanding the molecular effects underlying the efficacy of modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) against amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) analyses suggested a pleiotropic molecular mechanism of action of modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) through targeting Aβ-glutamate-glutamate receptor signalling leading to reduced inflammation and neurodegeneration. We also identified surface expression of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)2 on sEVL1CAM useful in potentially distinguishing ‘responders’ versus ‘non-responders’ to modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) intervention.

12,methods0," Plasma and CSF samples  Archived plasma and CSF samples were obtained from a recently published study.17 Briefly, in the completed study (approved by the Wake Forest Institutional Review Board; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02984540), participants were divided into two cognitive subgroups: CN adults with subjective memory complaints diagnosed using Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative criteria; and adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosed by expert physicians and neuropsychologists using the National Institute on Aging at National Institutes of Health and the Alzheimer's Association guidelines. Major inclusion and exclusion criteria for participant’s recruitment have been reported earlier.17 The demographic details of participants are provided in Supplementary Table 1.",d4f4664a-1872-4b41-885b-f62503125bf3
13,methods1," The study consisted of a randomized crossover design in which participants (both CN and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) consumed either modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) or the control American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks, followed by a 6-week washout period in which participants were instructed to resume their pre-study diet, after which the second diet was consumed for 6 weeks. The proportions of carbohydrates and fat were the main variables manipulated between the two diets. The target macronutrient composition (expressed as % of total calories) was 5–10% carbohydrate, 60–65% fat and 30% protein for modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD); and 55–65% carbohydrate, 15–20% fat and 20–30% protein for American Heart Association diet (AHAD). Prior to diet randomization, baseline characterization of cognitive status, lumbar puncture (LP), MRI and metabolic profiles were performed.",8c120a5a-b5e8-4eff-ab46-a3f210736513
14,methods2," Cognitive function, LP, MRI and metabolic parameters were reassessed after each diet. The fasting blood was collected before and after each diet. Blood samples were immediately placed on ice and spun within 30 min at 2200 rpm in a cold centrifuge for 15 min. The plasma was aliquoted into separate storage tubes and flash-frozen at −80°C until analysed. All assays were performed following the one-time thaw of frozen samples. Participants completed LP after a 12 h fast at baseline and after each diet for collection of CSF.  Isolation of total EV (TE) from plasma and neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) isolation from TE  TE and neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) were isolated, as reported by us recently.33 Schematic representation of experimental steps is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1A.",84510f12-6a5e-4bff-87ba-69d0f193e85b
15,methods3," Briefly, plasma samples from CN (n = 11) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 9) from all pre- and post-diet conditions were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min, 2000 g for 10 min followed by 10 000 g for 30 min at 4°C to remove the larger sized vesicles. The collected supernatant was treated with thromboplastin-D, and EV were isolated using the ExoQuick (System Biosciences, CA, USA) as reported earlier.34 For sEVL1CAM isolation, TE were incubated overnight with biotin-tagged L1CAM antibody (Clone eBio5G3 [5G3], ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA). Next, streptavidin-tagged agarose resin (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) was added. Following incubation, EV bound to agarose resins were centrifuged, and the supernatant containing unbound EV were removed. Finally, sEVL1CAM were removed from beads by adding IgG elution buffer (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and pH of the eluate was neutralized by 1 M Tris base (pH = 9).",87f72a31-f247-4148-8bb5-520d25c97988

Human IgG isotype (biotin) was also incubated with TE as a control to repudiate the non-specific isolation of neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE)/EV, following the same protocol and experimental conditions.  Nanoparticle tracking analysis  Quantification of the hydrodynamic diameter distribution and concentration of EV were performed using the Nanosight NS300 (Malvern Instruments, UK) as reported by us recently.33 The instrument was primed with PBS (filtered through a 0.22 μm filter) and maintained at 25°C. Accurate nanoparticle tracking was verified using 100 and 200 nm polystyrene nanoparticle standards (Malvern Instruments) prior to capturing the samples.",16ba04fa-bba5-46bb-b075-0e87f5b69e14
17,methods5," TE and neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) were diluted in 0.22 μm filtered PBS to measure size and concentration. Five measurements (30 s each) were obtained for each sample and their average was plotted.  Immunogold labelling and transmission electron microscopy  For immunogold labelling, sEVL1CAM were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS buffer (pH 7.4), then adsorbed for 1 h to a carbon-coated grid. Clusters of differentiation 63 (CD63) antibody was conjugated with gold particles (20 nm) using a gold conjugation kit as per the manufacturer’s recommendation (Abcam, MA, USA). Samples were first incubated with primary antibody (L1CAM, CD63 and CD9) and then secondary antibody tagged with 10 nm gold particles or directly with anti-CD63–20 nm gold particles. sEVL1CAM were stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 5 min, and images were captured on Tecnai T12 transmission electron microscopy (transmission electron microscopy (TEM)).",c98696e5-61c5-46a0-8f52-edd5e2b317a6

19,methods7," Finally, one step 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine solution was added, and the plate was read at 450 nm (experimental plan presented in Supplementary Fig. 1C).  Confocal microscopy  To confirm the purity of isolated sEVL1CAM and also to confirm the presence of L1CAM on neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) surface (and co-expression with CD63), sEVL1CAM were isolated as described above. Agarose resin bound sEVL1CAM were incubated with L1CAM-PE (BioLegend, CA, USA) antibody for 1 h at RT in dark followed by incubation with 1 × membrane labelling dye CellBrite 488 (Biotium, CA, USA) for 15 min at RT. Agarose resin were washed three times and resuspended in 25 µl of filtered PBS. Agarose resin bound with sEVL1CAM were then transferred on a clean microscopic slide, and coverslip was placed over it. Agarose resin tagged with IgG-biotin antibody was also used following similar experimental conditions and used as control.",04257e6b-fa63-477c-a795-7a0727295ff4
20,methods8," Slides were then imaged on Olympus FV1200 spectral laser scanning confocal microscope with 20 × or 40 × objective lens, with membrane labelling dye on green channel and L1CAM-PE with red pseudo-colour. Similarly, after isolating sEVL1CAM with agarose resin, L1CAM-PE and CD63-APC antibodies were used to label agarose resin-bound sEVL1CAM for 1 h at RT to analyse the co-expression of L1CAM and CD63 on sEVL1CAM surface. After three washes, 25 µl of resin was transferred on a glass slide and imaged using pseudo green colour for PE signal (for L1CAM). Agarose resin tagged with IgG-biotin antibody, incubated with TE, were also labelled with L1CAM-PE and CD63-APC and used as control.",b6754040-20f3-4254-916c-504c831cf2c5
21,methods9,"  Flow cytometry  To analyse the percentage of sEVL1CAM in TE from CN and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants, TE were labelled with membrane labelling dye CellBrite 488 (Biotium, CA, USA) with and without the L1CAM-PE (BioLegend, CA, USA) or synaptophysin-Alexa Fluor 647 (Novus Biologicals, CO, USA) antibody. TE without dye were used as control to set the gate for positively (dye) labelled EV (Supplementary Fig. 2A). TE labelled with dye but without L1CAM-PE/synaptophysin-AF647 antibody were used to set the gate for PE/AF647 positive events (Supplementary Fig. 2B). L1CAM/synaptophysin antibody and dye at the same dilution in PBS (filtered through 0.22 μm filter) were also analysed. A threshold cut of 2000 at violet side scatter was set up to exclude the machine background noise. PE and AF647 labelled isotype control were used to confirm the specificity of the fluorescence signals (Supplementary Fig. 2C).",525b340a-fce6-4248-9273-b3e4a21b29db
22,methods10," Samples were diluted 1:100 in filtered PBS before acquisition to achieve an abort ratio of less than 10%. All samples were acquired on CytoFlex (Beckman Coulter Life Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) for 60 s at a low flow rate. Filtered PBS was run for 60 s in between the samples.  To confirm the dye positive events are EV and to negate the swarm effect, serial dilutions of samples were assessed. The linear reduction in total events with dilution in the gated regions confirmed that the positive events were EV (Supplementary Fig. 2D). L1CAM-PE and synaptophysin-AF647 antibody labelled EV were also serially diluted and measured for change in mean fluorescent intensity (Supplementary Fig. 2E). For further confirmation, 0.25% triton X-100 was added to the EV, and lysed samples were acquired. Gate applied to detect dye positive EV were applied to all the other samples to confirm the capture of EV only.",f6e920dd-f230-4dd9-8a4d-023e6490c72a
23,methods11," Similarly, TE were analysed to identify the percentage of sEVsynaptophysin (SYP) (Supplementary Fig. 2F) using a synaptophysin-AF647 antibody.  A similar experimental set-up was used to characterize the neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) (Supplementary Fig. 3). The purity of isolated neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) was confirmed by three different surface markers; L1CAM, synaptophysin and neuron-specific enolase (ENO2). neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) (sEVL1CAM, sEVsynaptophysin (SYP) and sEVneural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)) were labelled with L1CAM-PE, synaptophysin-AF647 or ENO2-PE antibody at room temperature for 2 h. Thereafter, CellBrite dye at a final 1 × concentration (in filtered PBS) was used to label the neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) for 15 min at RT.",2a79cd48-26b9-4f0a-ad44-0ff8b913c709
24,methods12," neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) without dye were used to separate the neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) from background noise. Also, neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) with dye but without antibodies were used to set the gate for L1CAM-PE, ENO2-PE and synaptophysin-AF647 positive events. neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) samples were acquired for 60 s, with filtered PBS for 60 s in between the samples.  To measure the surface expression of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1 and 2, sEVL1CAM were isolated using a biotin-labelled L1CAM antibody tagged on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads using our previously described method.33 Magnetic beads were washed four times, and sEVL1CAM bound to magnetic beads were labelled with fluorescently tagged (AF647) antibodies for monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1 and 2. Magnetic beads bound sEVL1CAM were analysed by flow cytometry by acquiring total of 10 000 events (beads).",ab96a0ce-5594-4c85-ade8-a1b41ed43b6f

The distributions of the outcome measures were checked to ensure that the conditional normality assumption was satisfied. The comparisons of size, concentration and protein concentration per EV in TE and sEVL1CAM between pre- and post-modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) and American Heart Association diet (AHAD) conditions were performed using the paired t-tests when the sample size was small (e.g. n = 3 to six per group).

The outcome measure was the change in the biomarker and protein concentration.",62ed60e4-ffcb-45f3-842b-6b09909c0f88
28,analysis1," Pre-outcome measure, diet (modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) versus American Heart Association diet (AHAD)), experimental group (CN versus mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), and the interaction between diet and experimental group were included in the model. The least squares mean for changes in biomarkers was calculated for each diet and experimental group. Testing whether the least squares mean was equal to 0 was the same as testing whether adjusted pre- and post-biomarkers were equal. The comparison of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)2 expression on sEVL1CAMbetween responders and non-responders was performed using the two-sample t-tests. Correlations between sEVL1CAM markers and clinical parameters were calculated using Pearson correlation coefficient estimates. Further, we performed logistic regression analyses considering responder status (responders versus non-responders) as the outcome variable and sEVL1CAM as the independent variable.",3c92b958-65fa-40cd-9e74-97d3720e76e7
29,analysis2," The area under the curve was estimated to examine the prediction ability of sEVL1CAM on responder status. The non-parametric method was used to evaluate whether the fitted model (including sEVL1CAM as a covariate) was better than the uninformative model (no covariate, null model).35 The correlations among sEVL1CAM, sEVsynaptophysin (SYP) and sEVneural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) for NfL and Aβ1–42 were computed using Pearson correlation coefficient estimates. Multiple comparisons were not corrected because the study is mainly for descriptive purposes.

Since the expression of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)2 is more on neurons and possesses a higher affinity towards substrate compared with monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1,14 higher expression of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)2 on neurons may be expected to increase transport of ketone bodies and help neurons to make a metabolic transition for the substrate.",6d4b9d2c-f17a-424b-9533-4fb75f063c45
63,discussion2," Thus, assessing the expression of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)2 on plasma neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) may be an important measure in determining the effectiveness of KD and help screen participants that may benefit from such an intervention.  Neuronal EV have shown promise in detecting established Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers such as Aβ1–42.28 Higher Aβ1–42 levels in plasma neuronal EV have been shown to correspond to greater amyloid burden assessed with PET (PiB tracer), and Aβ1–42 levels in neuronal EV directly correlate with Alzheimer’s disease stage and progression.21,28,42 This is in contrast to the well-established finding that Aβ1–42 levels in the CSF are inversely correlated with neuritic plaque burden.43 Furthermore, the findings regarding Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been mixed. CSF Aβ and p-tau levels have been shown to be comparable in CN and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in several studies.",57c40e45-86e8-4d70-941d-5fd5894f876f
64,discussion3,"44,45 We previously reported that modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) treatment increased the Aβ1–42 levels in the CSF of participants, suggesting a reduction in Aβ aggregation and better clearance.17 Here, we observed a significant reduction in sEVL1CAM Aβ1–42 levels in those same mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants following modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) treatment. This is an exciting observation suggesting the sEVL1CAM in plasma could be useful in characterizing Aβ plaques in the brain and could be an additional blood-based parameter to potentially supplement the existing neuroimaging and CSF measures. However, this certainly warrants the need for a further study into the mechanism involved in the loading of Aβ in EV and their secretion. It is plausible that Aβ in EV is mainly the intracellular Aβ that is known to arise from APP processing in the endosomal compartment.",76731160-9ba5-4d2a-a84f-69801b131033
65,discussion4,"46 This speculation is supported by the fact that neuronal EV cargo includes BACE1,23 which plays a critical role in APP processing and the generation of Aβ, both at the cell membrane as well in endosomes.46 sEVL1CAM also showed a significant reduction in p181-tau levels following modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) intervention, as well as a reduction in p181-tau/total tau from most participants (7/9) in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group. Also notable was the observation that sEVL1CAM had significantly decreased NfL levels in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group following modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) intervention, even though prior CSF data was unrevealing.17 These results suggest that sEVL1CAM in plasma could provide valuable information about the changes in the key Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers.  Alterations in cerebral glucose and glutamate levels can lead to the deposition of Aβ plaques.",332495b8-dec2-40d5-a572-3ed7285a0c77
66,discussion5,"47 KD may compensate for glucose hypometabolism and restore mitochondrial bioenergetics; however, its effect on neuronal glutamate levels remains unknown. Importantly, over 40% of neuronal synapses are glutamatergic, and the disturbance in the glutamate levels and glutamate receptors expression and their localization have been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease, influencing memory, cognition and behaviour.47 We observed a significant increase in the glutamate level in sEVL1CAM following modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) intervention in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants, suggesting higher intracellular glutamate in the neurons. However, no change in the CSF glutamate level was observed, highlighting the importance of studying neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE).",1f332d71-bd99-4e36-94d2-0c7747f15faf
67,discussion6," An earlier study has reported that plasma exosomes reflect a similar change in the expression of glutamate receptor with aging as in the brain tissue of transgenic mice.48 Further, modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) targeted the expression of various ionotropic glutamate receptors, consisting of NMDA and AMPA type, suggesting a restoration of glutamate-glutamate receptor signalling, which is critical for long-term potentiation. For example, we observed an increased expression of GRIN1, an obligatory subunit of NMDA type glutamate receptor, while observing a decrease in the GRIN2A and GRIN2B subunits of NMDA receptors and a decrease in AMPA subunit GRIA1. It is not clear, though, whether modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) intervention has an inhibitory effect on the expression of these glutamate receptors subunits in the extrasynaptic region, which is usually associated with higher Aβ production and neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease.",a6572258-c9d1-461a-9648-0fd6e2fdc88d
68,discussion7,"49 Aβ also adversely affects glutamate cycling and glutamate receptor signalling while reducing the uptake of glutamate by astrocytes and promoting higher glutamate levels in the synaptic cleft and activation of extrasynaptic GRIN2B containing NMDA receptors leading to synaptic impairment.47 Thus, a ketogenic intervention may target Aβ expression at multiple levels and possibly its reduction coincides with the restoration of glutamatergic neurons.  AGEs are formed by non-enzymatic glycosylation of macromolecules and increase in response to hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress.50 Higher AGEs could induce toxicity via aberrant cross-linking with proteins and the production of ROS.51,52 AGEs are pro-inflammatory, activate RAGE (receptor for AGE), contribute to Aβ production in the brain, and regulate the influx of circulating Aβ across the blood–brain barrier.53,54 AGE content in neurons (and astrocytes) increases with increasing Braak tangle stage, CERAD tangle score and neuritic plaques.",31c8e9b9-0a92-419a-827c-0a8220daef84
69,discussion8,"50 RAGE also promotes senile plaque formation via tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death.53,55–57 We observed a substantial reduction in AGEs in sEVL1CAM following modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) intervention that correlated well with the significant reduction observed in the sEVL1CAM induced monocyte NF-κB activity.  Although L1CAM has been extensively used to isolate neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) and characterize neuronal biomarkers,21,22,24,25,27,30 several questions have been recently raised regarding its presence on EV surface,32 as well as the neuronal specificity of L1CAM. The present study addresses a few of these critical questions. We have presented immunogold labelling/transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confocal microscopy fluorescence images, modified ELISA-based assay and flow cytometry data to confirm the presence of L1CAM on the surface of sEV.",37122623-737d-4ed1-857a-f359edfac733
70,discussion9," We further isolated neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) from plasma-based upon two more surface biomarkers (synaptophysin and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)) and characterized Aβ1–42 and NfL levels. Using both the markers, we observed quite similar trend in terms of the effect of modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) on the levels of Aβ1–42 and NfL as with L1CAM. Further, we also identified the relative percentage of sEVL1CAMand sEVsynaptophysin (SYP) in plasma. Overall, though high concordance was observed in results between sEVL1CAM, sEVsynaptophysin (SYP) and sEVneural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) but outcomes were not exactly the same, suggesting a possible heterogeneity in the neuronal-derived EV populations, which needs to be further studied.  Despite several advancements, there are a few notable drawbacks of the present study. One of the major limitations is the small sample size and crossover design of the present study.",20ae9ba1-e218-43d6-b5c0-3a174bee8fab
71,discussion10," This could be overcome by adopting a similar approach in other studies with a higher number of participants. Another inherent limitation of the present study could be that the use of above-mentioned neuronal surface biomarkers does not confirm 100% neuronal or CNS origin, though clearly showed enrichment for Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers. This warrants the need for more specific EV biomarkers for neurons and other cell types in the CNS. Besides, our assays did not provide information about the localization of cargo molecules whether present in the core, membrane or sticking on the surface of sEV. Lastly, sample storage and freeze/thaw conditions could potentially affect the samples and studied measures. However, prior to conducting this study, we have performed a pilot study to confirm that plasma storage (at −80°C) does not significantly affect the integrity and cargo of sEVL1CAM compared with fresh samples.",901122dc-102b-4731-852a-8d450573eb23
72,discussion11,"  Overall, results from the present study support the usefulness of plasma neuronal enriched small extracellular vesicles (NEE) as a tool in developing novel preventive and therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer’s disease and potentially related neurodegenerative disorders. The present study additionally sheds light on the beneficial effects of the modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) on previously reported regulation of Alzheimer’s disease pathology17 and associated mechanistic pathways.
