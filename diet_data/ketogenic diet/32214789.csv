0,methods0," 2.1. Searching Processes to Identify Eligible Studies  EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were used to find relevant studies. All studies were published in the English language up to October, 2020. Search terms for this meta-analysis were “athletes” (athletic, sports, players) AND “ketogenic diet” (low carbohydrate and high fat). All possible combinations of the search terms were used to select relevant studies. One researcher (J. L.) and one reviewer (H. L.) independently selected relevant studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Further discussions resolved any disagreements in the selection processes. The citation lists of review studies were screened to find any relevant studies missed. Inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were randomized control trials that reported outcomes of ketogenic diet use in athletes. Athletes must have comprised both experimental and control groups. Descriptions of the ketogenic diet and assessments of ketone status were required.",e90dc7c0-e3ad-434b-a312-99570a253670
1,methods1," Pilot and review studies and studies of non-athlete populations were excluded. The Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess quality and risk of bias [10]. This tool is a seven-domain bias assessment: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcomes, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases. These domains provided an assessment of bias and overall quality of the reports. Cut-off points or scores were not indicated in the assessment. Two researchers (J. L and H. L.) also evaluated the quality and bias independently. Additional discussions resolved any disagreements.  2.2. Statistical Analysis  Effect sizes of ketogenic diet interventions for athletes were calculated by using the standardized mean difference statistic, the difference in both treatment and control groups’ means divided by the pooled standard deviation.",3b441587-a339-469a-85fc-fa43681d23e8
2,methods2," If there were more than two outcomes, the effect size was computed. Effect sizes between 0.2 and 0.5 were considered to be small. A medium effect size was 0.5–0.8 and a large effect size was >0.8. The Q statistic was used to determined heterogeneity (p = 0.1). If I2 was ≤50%, heterogeneity was absent and a fixed-effect model was used. If I2 was >50%, heterogeneity existed and a random-effects model was used. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. All analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 1.25 software (Biostatic Inc., Englewood, NJ, USA).  3. Results  The selection process for the systematic review and meta-analysis is presented in Figure 1. Those search terms were used for initial screening, and 540 studies were retrieved in the initial screening.",e874800f-7d32-4cd3-8279-cfc0f0130589
3,methods3," All titles and abstracts were used to determine the eligibility for inclusion in the meta-analysis; and 453 studies that were review studies, pilot studies, protocol studies, or recreationally trained individual studies, and studies that were not related to ketogenic diets and exercise were excluded. The remaining 87 studies’ full texts were reviewed to determine eligibility. An additional 80 studies were excluded. These did not include pre- or post-ketogenic diet outcome data, were not restricted to professional athlete and control groups, or did not use a standard diet. Therefore, eight studies [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18] were selected for the current meta-analysis. The average ketogenic diet was 3 weeks and ranged from 1 week to 24 weeks. During ketogenic diet use, the athletes participated in their training. Ketone status was monitored. Aerobic athletes were included in four studies, and resistance-trained athletes were included in four studies.",0f736f16-a572-4c11-a229-c54c6e4882e6
4,methods4,"  Basic characteristics of the selected studies, including name of the first author, year of publication, country in which the study was conducted, design of the study, sample size, participants’ ages and sports involved, ketogenic diet processes and ketone assessments, and main outcomes, are presented in Table 1. The quality and bias of risk measured by the Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias Tool is presented in Supplementary Table S1. A high degree of bias was not detected in any of the selected studies. Each common outcome variable was used to calculate the effect size when the outcome variable was reported in at least two studies. All outcomes of the selected studies were included to calculate effect size.  3.1. Influences of Ketogenic Diet on Body Composition  Four trials that tested % body fat were included to calculate effect size (Figure 2).

However, those who consumed ketogenic diets did not have statistically significant changes in body mass (d = 0.05 [95% confidence interval, −0.32–0.42; p = 0.77; k = 4]) compared to those of non-ketogenic diet athletes.  3.2. Influences of Ketogenic Diet on Respiratory Exchange Rate at VO2max, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, and Heart Rate  Those on ketogenic diets in three trials demonstrated statistically significantly reduced respiratory exchange rates (d = −1.92 [95% confidence interval, −2.70–−1.14; p = 0.01; k = 3]) compared to control groups (Figure 2). However, there were no statistical differences in VO2max (d = 0.12 [95% confidence interval, −0.35–0.59; p = 0.62; k = 4]) in four trials and heart rate (d = −0.48 [95% confidence interval, −0.96–0.00; p = 0.44; k = 3]) in three trials between experimental and control groups.  3.3.",8d9788db-971c-41ea-8a5c-7a442518902b
6,methods6," Influences of Ketogenic Diet on Total Cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol, Triglyceride, Glucose Level, and Insulin Level  Total cholesterol in athletes consuming ketogenic diets was statistically significantly reduced (d = 1.32 [95% confidence interval, 0.64–1.99; p = 0.05; k = 2]) in two trials (Figure 2). However, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (d = 1.07 [95% confidence interval, −0.21–2.35; p = 0.10; k = 3]) in three trials, triglyceride (d = −0.49 [95% confidence interval, −2.58–1.61; p = 0.65; k = 3]) in three trials, glucose level (d = −0.13 [95% confidence interval, −0.82–0.56; p = 0.70; k = 2]) in two trials and insulin level (d = −0.19 [95% confidence interval, −0.14–0.76; p = 0.69; k = 2]) in two trials did not statistically significantly change compared to control athletes.  4.",a8bacc3f-1299-448d-b600-a40847d1c8da
7,methods7," Discussion  Professional athletes who consumed ketogenic diets had reduced body fat percentages, increased respiratory exchange rates, and increased total cholesterol levels. All participants exercised, but diet was the only difference between the experimental groups and the control groups. Ketogenic diets were consumed for an average of 10 weeks, and average exercise interventions were moderate to vigorous exercise interventions five times per week. The ketogenic diets may help to reduce body fat percentages when professional athletes need to decrease body mass; however, before starting the ketogenic diet, total cholesterol level should be monitored in those with high cholesterol levels at baseline.  The ketogenic diets were effective in reducing body fat percentages of professional athletes. Additionally, the ketogenic diet groups had increased VO2max that indicated levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, but these measurements did not reach statistical significance.",82d2a8d8-4ae6-4000-811b-67845aace17d
8,methods8," There were no meta-analysis studies that compared those results. A previous pilot study demonstrated reduced body weight, body fat, and well-being, but not exercise performance, in endurance athletes after completing ketogenic diets [19]. Another previous study demonstrated that the VO2max had a negative correlation with body fat percentage in female athletes but it was not statistically significant [20]. While additional studies are needed to support the effects of ketogenic diets, athletes who consumed ketogenic diets had reduced body fat percentages, which may be associated with increased aerobic capacity.  Athletes who consumed ketogenic diets had a statistically significantly decreased respiratory exchange rate on the VO2max test, but cardiorespiratory fitness and heart rate did not change significantly. The reduced respiratory exchange rate after consuming ketogenic diets was consistent with the findings of a previous study [21].",dd27054a-dac6-4918-a8e9-ee33ed95990a
9,methods9," Increased high fat intakes were associated with reduced respiratory exchange rate [22]. Changes in cardiorespiratory fitness findings are controversial, but we did not find statistically significant changes in our meta-analysis. Previous studies demonstrated impairments in high intensity, endurance performance after ketogenic diet adaption [3,10,16] due to reduced glycogenolysis and prorate dehydrogenase activity [23] and increased heart rate [11] that was associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity [24]. Other studies did not demonstrate statistically significant changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and heart rate [15]. Respiratory exchange rate, cardiorespiratory fitness and heart rate were influenced by exercise type in both aerobic athletes and resistance athletes when the athletes consumed the ketogenic diet. The findings on exercise type may need to be confirmed in further studies.",37b991c9-8679-41f4-8adb-dab50df30244
10,methods10,"  When athletes consumed ketogenic diets during exercise training, these athletes had increased total cholesterol compared to control groups. Although total cholesterol has become an irrelevant isolated marker for heart disease risk for any population [25,26], athletes with pre-existing high level of total cholesterol should be monitored while on a ketogenic diet. Dietary macronutrient composition was not statistically significantly different between the two groups, but athletes had significantly higher energy intake and energy expenditure compared to non-athletes [27]. The lipid profiles may be not influenced by training or non-training, but the nutrient composition effects on lipid profile levels included total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.",bb095c03-7af7-41ff-9046-4b64e7210f73
11,methods11," Several studies demonstrated that participating in exercise decreased lipid profiles including total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [28,29], but a study of athletes professionally or recreationally trained had conflicting results after participants completed ketogenic diet use. A previous study reported increased low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but decreased body fat, in recreationally trained CrossFit trainees after participating in ketogenic diet use [30]. Another previous study found no statistically significant changes in athlete lipid profiles [17]. Although additional studies are needed to confirm lipid profile results, the lipid profiles were associated with diverse factors including family history and nutritional habits.",f53298dd-b981-491c-98f8-3e4bb5aa53a1
12,methods12," Additionally, the effect size of lipid profile as measured by low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and ratio of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was not investigated due to limited numbers of studies or missing data. Insulin and glucose levels were decreased in athletes using ketogenic diets, but the results in the current studies were not statistically significant. The restricted source of glucose removed the trigger of insulin release that led to decreased insulin levels [31]. The effects of ketogenic diets in athletes on insulin and glucose levels need further investigation.  There were several limitations in the current meta-analysis. First, while effect size was calculated for two trials, sample sizes were small. Caution needs to be exercised in generalizing these results. Second, professional athletes who performed both endurance and resistance exercise were included.",bf224c6e-a0bc-4c8b-9c6c-7c3d98143205
13,methods13," Depending on the exercise type, the results of this meta-analysis will need recalculation when additional studies regarding the effects of ketogenic diets on athletes are added. Third, the periods of ketogenic diets and exercise interventions were diverse; this may have had an influence on the outcomes. Both short-term and long-term use of ketogenic diet and exercise interventions need to be conducted. Fourth, variables of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose were one-off measures that have the possibility of over- or underestimation of results. The low density lipoprotein (LDL) data that are an important assessment of cardiometabolic risk were not reported in studies that limited current findings to the effects of ketogenic diet on lipid profiles. More studies about the ketogenic diet and lipid profiles are needed.",b8bd4d19-c2de-4bff-a1b0-776769421b7f
14,methods14," Last, all selected studies assessed ketone status, but the levels of ketones and assessment tools for the ketone status were not consistent across all selected studies.  There are potential mechanisms of the ketogenic diet on reducing body fat percentage among athletes. Increased intake of fat in daily meals elevated total fat oxidation during exercise [1,32]. Additionally, a higher level of fat oxidation shifted utilization from carbohydrates and led to concomitant muscle glycogen sparing [33,34]. Increased fat oxidation might be associated with the decreased body fat percentage observed in athletes on a ketogenic diet compared to those on a standard diet.  5. Conclusions  Ketogenic diets reduced body fat percentages and increased respiratory exchange rates and total cholesterol. Additional studies may be needed to confirm these results. The athletes in this current meta-analysis study participated in an average of five weeks of ketogenic diet consumption.",c9b96c3d-8b28-4559-a9fe-b09d96e7c005
15,methods15," Additional studies on the shorter- and longer-term effects of ketogenic diets on athlete body composition, cardiometabolic factors including respiratory exchange, cardiorespiratory fitness and heart rate, and lipid profiles may be required. To further understand the effects of ketogenic diets on athletes, exercise type may also need to be considered in future studies.
