0,methods0," The effectiveness of KD therapy was analyzed retrospectively in a group of 42 pediatric and adolescent patients. All patients were hospitalized in the Department of Developmental Neurology.

2,methods2," During the treatment and subsequent visits to the clinic, the following were evaluated: the number of seizures, the occurrence of side effects, EEG recordings in wakefulness and sleep with hyperventilation and photostimulation, ECG, abdominal ultrasound examinations, blood count, liver tests, electrolytes, selenium, and l-carnitine concentration, the concentration of ketone bodies, thyroid parameters, calcium-phosphate metabolism, calcium-creatinine index, the concentration of antiepileptic drugs in the blood, and pancreatic parameters. In addition, patients were examined neurologically, pediatrically, or internistically (depending on the age of the patients), psychologically, and physiotherapeutically. The above-mentioned tests were performed monthly during the first three months of treatment, then once every three months during the next nine months of treatment, and then once every six months afterward.",1913656d-0a54-41fe-b557-953cf197831a
3,methods3," Between clinic visits, the patients’ parents monitored the concentration of ketone bodies at home. In addition, once a year, the patients were consulted cardiologically and urologically and had a densitometric examination performed. The effectiveness of KD was assessed according to the type of diet, the type of seizures, and the known (KE) or undetermined genetic etiology (undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE)). KE patients constituted 47.62% (20/42) of the study group, while undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) patients constituted 52.38% (22/42). None of the patients was treated with vagus nerve stimulation or eligible for surgical treatment. Detailed data of the cohort are presented in Table 1.  Among the known underlying causes of the observed symptoms, there were CACNA1S, CHD2, DEPDC5, KIF1A, PIGN, SCN1A, SCN8A, SLC2A1, SYNGAP1 pathogenic variants, trisomy 21, and deletion 15q11-13.",6ed3d1e1-b7fb-427d-a0cd-029f4be7ee4b
4,methods4," In the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) group, the following syndromes were diagnosed: Doose syndrome (DS), juvenile epilepsy with absence seizures (juvenile epilepsy with absence seizures (JAE)), Angelman-like syndrome (AS-like), Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS)), Rett-like syndrome (RS–like), febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES)), and epilepsy with focal seizures of unknown etiology (unknown etiology (UNFE)). The patients with AS-like presented clinical symptoms observed in Angelman syndrome, i.e., dysmorphic features, intellectual disability, atactic gait, epileptic seizures, lack of speech, cheerful disposition, sleep disorders, changes in EEG. However, it was impossible to determine the observed symptoms’ molecular or cytogenetic basis. Furthermore, the group of patients with RS-like included girls with clinical symptoms resembling RS, i.e.",ba87ce58-2953-4e45-8771-ba14ee420ff5
5,methods5,", slowing down of the normal psychomotor development observed around six months of age, lack of speech and normal motor development, lack of functional use of hands with movement stereotypes, episodes of hyperventilation and respiratory retention, intellectual disability, and seizures. Again, however, no molecular basis of the observed symptoms was found. Attempts to establish the molecular cause of these syndromes (e.g., array CGH, WES analysis, methylation of the UBE3A locus) were ineffective. The statistical methods used to analyze the obtained data are described for each of the results.  3. Results  Complete resolution of epileptic seizures was observed in 28.6% (12/42) of all patients; 75.00% (9/12) were patients with KE. Considering only the KE group of patients, 45.00% (9/20) achieved total seizure reduction. In the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) group, this percentage was lower—13.63% (3/22). Lack of KD treatment efficacy was defined as a reduction of ≤50%.",f987f7f1-b75f-4348-864c-1a7e29130fed
6,methods6," This was the case in 10.00% (2/20) of patients in the KE group and 50.00% (11/22) in the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) group. Detailed data on the degree of seizure reduction in each group is presented in Table 2.  Key message: The ketogenic diet treatment was more effective in the group of patients with known etiology of epilepsy.  To check whether the known etiology of the disease was associated with greater effectiveness of seizure reduction after the KD treatment, Φ Yule’s correlation analysis was performed. It was found that the known etiology was related to the greater effectiveness of seizure reduction after dietary treatment (Φ = 0.37; p = 0.02).  The mean age of the patients in whom the diet was successful was 7.44 years (SD ± 5.75). In the group with an ineffective treatment, it was 5.04 years (SD ± 3.20). Among patients under two years of age (8/42), the KD proved successful in 62.50% (5/8) cases.",5e64bb83-3037-42f4-be25-a5a3fd963551
7,methods7,"  A point biserial correlation coefficient was performed to check whether the patients’ age impacted the effectiveness of seizure reduction using the KD. The result was statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). A Mann–Whitney U difference test was also performed to check for intergroup differences, the effect was statistically negligible (U = 135.00; p = 0.11).  Furthermore, we assessed whether the treatment duration affected the effectiveness of seizure reduction. A point-biserial correlation result was statistically insignificant.  It was possible to obtain a detailed medical history in both groups and determine the types of epileptic seizures, as shown in Figure 1. Noteworthy was the high percentage of partial seizures in the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) group (68% vs. 30%).  After initiation of KD treatment, generalized tonic-clonic (2/12), atonic (2/8), and partial (3/6) seizures were found to be the most resistant in the KE group.",d21b9302-755f-49c5-be62-93039e3e2cbe
8,methods8," On the other hand, the worst outcome in the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) group was seen for atonic (3/8), myoclonic (4/7), and partial (12/15) seizures.  Key message: Ketogenic diet treatment was most effective in the reduction of non-partial seizures.  Cramer’s V correlation analysis was performed to determine whether the type of symptoms influenced the efficacy of seizure reduction. It was found that the variables were related (V = 0.52; p = 0.01). To check whether there were differences in the effectiveness of the KD in the groups, the Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric equivalent of the one-way analysis of variance was calculated (due to the unequal size of the groups). The differences were statistically significant (chi2 = 11.24; p = 0.01). Thus, the most effective treatment was in the group with non-partial seizures, with moderate effectiveness with the mixed episode group, and least effectiveness for the partial seizures only group.",710dbf03-e1dc-4c16-b207-a5f0c36cf718
9,methods9," The exact seizure reduction by type is presented in Table 3.  To determine whether the type of diet influenced the effectiveness of seizure reduction, Cramer’s V correlation analysis was performed, with no significant relationships between the variables found (V = 0.26; p = 0.90). A Mann–Whitney U test also showed no statistically significant differences in the type of diet and treatment effectiveness (U = 165.00; p = 0.42). Table 4 shows the size and effects for the analyzed diet therapy groups.  In some cases, patients discontinued the KD treatment (5/20 and 11/22, respectively, for KE and undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) groups). The most common reason was the lack of expected effects and difficulty in maintaining the diet (80% vs. 91%). In eleven of these patients, treatment was completed within one year, and in the remaining five patients, treatment lasted more than one year.",7e63b7dc-4f7b-4abe-b8ef-25aa3c0d5d52
10,methods10," Among the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) patients who discontinued treatment, for two, the reason was complete resolution of seizures, and for the remaining nine, seizure reductions of below 50%. In the group of patients with KE, two patients had a reduction of seizures <50%. Despite a decrease in seizures >50% in the remaining three, the parents decided not to continue further therapy. In general, dietary treatment was well tolerated. No serious adverse events were observed. However, if the caregivers reported any side-effects, it was mainly at the beginning of the treatment (i.e., in the first month). The most commonly reported side effects were vomiting and reluctance to eat and drink. Among the symptoms persisting for more than one month after the KD initiation, which were the reason for discontinuation of therapy, weakness with apathy, and a feeling of hunger, were the most frequently mentioned. In addition, during therapy, patients reported somnolence (15% vs.",6ed53baa-a5d9-4f7c-8e10-e927c1e434db
11,methods11," 14%), nausea and vomiting (10% vs. 18%), excessive fatigue (10% vs. 4.5%), and increased symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux (5% vs. 4.5%). Overall incidence of KD therapy side effects was 26.2% (11/42). None of the diets had an increased number of side effects compared to the others. However, the number of reported side effects was greater in the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) group 63.6% (7/11) compared to the KE group 36.4% (4/11).  Key message: Ketogenic diet treatment reduced the overall usage of anti-seizure drugs.  During the KD treatment in the KE group, in 40% (8/20) of cases, previously used medications were discontinued, while 25% (5/20) needed to start another ASD. At the same time, as many as 20% (4/20) of patients in this group used only the KD without any ASDs. In the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) patients group already using ASDs, these were discontinued in 36% of cases (8/22), while 55% of patients (12/22) had to take additional ASDs.",3da23c56-b13f-4f18-96c2-44782a603d19
12,methods12," None of the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) patients used the KD treatment without ASDs. More detailed data is presented in Table 5. To assess whether the effectiveness of the diet was related to the reduction of the number of ASDs used, Φ Yule’s correlation analysis was performed. It was found that higher efficacy was associated with decreased drug use (Φ = −0.34; p = 0.03).  We also asked parents about their views on the effect of the KD on improvement in cognitive functions. Their feelings were divided, as 50% (21/42) noticed progress, while the other half did not see positive effects. However, considering the parents’ responses concerning only a specific group, the improvement was reported in the KE group by 75% (15/20) and in the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) group by 27% (6/22).  4. Discussion  The KD is a recognized method of epilepsy treatment, although its exact mechanism of action remains elusive [36].",89a1c1ee-20ee-47b5-b676-1852c67a9a8c
13,methods13," Interest in the dietary and surgical treatment of epilepsy has increased in recent years. This is because the percentage of drug-resistant patients remains stable despite the introduction of many new ASDs in the therapy process, side effects associated with these drugs, and restrictions on the use of specific ASDs in the youngest patients. With time, the range of indications for the use of the KD has expanded, and at the same time, less restrictive forms of treatment have been introduced. This paper analyzed factors that may be related to the potential effectiveness of the KD in a group of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.  As mentioned, the KD is widely used in drug-resistant epilepsy as an add-on therapy after using two appropriately selected and dosed AEDs [7]. It is also the therapy of choice in patients with GLUT1DS and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD) [37,38].",ce9c80af-6b2a-40c3-b23a-3e34db07ed53
14,methods14," The potential mechanisms are by acting directly or indirectly on ion channels, increasing activation of seizure-reducing adenosine A1 receptors, enhancing mitochondrial function, or lowering of SIRT3-related oxidative stress [39].  Studies have indicated that KD therapy was effective in 35–85% of drug-resistant epilepsy patients [14,25,26,27,28]. Our results showed 69.05% (29/42) effectiveness in the whole cohort, demonstrating the importance of the KD in the treatment of refractory epilepsy.  Many different factors were analyzed to search for the optimal group to whom the KD treatment could be applied as most effective and safe. Some studies showed that a KD could be more effective in children under two years [31]. This may be due to the ineffectiveness of some ASDs on the maturing brain (lack of binding receptors), the multi-directional mechanism of action (including anti-inflammatory effects), and greater ease of dieting in young patients.",e942dc8f-99dc-4b70-896a-172899de0c14
15,methods15," At the same time, more and more data on efficacy in adult patients is emerging [40]. This finding is consistent with our results showing that KD treatment proved successful among patients under two years of age in 62.50% of cases (5/8). However, considering all patients’ data, we did not find a statistically significant correlation of age–effectiveness dependence. Thus, it seems that the etiology underlying the symptoms is more important than the age at which the treatment itself is started.  Another factor in the potential effectiveness of KD treatment is the time of therapy. Some studies observed a reduction in episodes by at least 50% in 75% of patients after three months of treatment, 73% after six months of treatment, and 90% after 12 months of treatment [41]. We found that the mean duration (years) of effective vs. ineffective KD treatment was 2.23 and 2.32. Further statistical investigation did not reveal any time–effectiveness correlation.",8ceaed29-c927-420f-9873-d10ffd1347ee
16,methods16," However, reports suggest that a period of three months KD can be a predictive criterion of seizure remission over six months [42].  Apart from the mutations leading to GLUT1DS and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD), other mutations result in epileptic encephalopathies that respond well to KD treatment, such as KCNQ2, SCN1A, SCN2A, or STXBP1 [43,44]. However, unfortunately, there are also those in which the response to the KD is much lower, e.g., CDKL5 [9].  We found that in the KE group, complete resolution of seizures occurred in 75% of cases (9/12). Our results showed, apart from the apparent KD effectiveness in SLC2A1 patients (5/5), that all (3/3) DEPDC5 and (1/1) SYNGAP1 patients achieved a 100% seizure reduction. In particular, observation of an excellent response to the KD among patients with epilepsy caused by the DEPDC5 mutation may be important. This is because of reported resistance to ASDs and the long-life persistence of seizures despite their use [45,46].",c3abcd62-6ea6-439c-937a-1683f86ac5de
17,methods17," As to SYNGAP1-related epilepsy, there was an identified correlation between the genotype and pharmacoresistance [47]. Pathogenic variants in exons 4 or 5 were more responsive to ASDs than exons 8–15. Nevertheless, SYNGAP1-related epilepsy is refractory to classical ASDs in approximately 50% of cases [48]. Thus, the KD could be a possible treatment choice in such cases.  On the other hand, the KD treatment was unfortunately ineffective in 50% (1/2) of SCN8A and 100% (1/1) of KIF1A patients. The KIF1A-related spectrum is vast, and ASD-resistant epilepsy is common in some known phenotypes [49]. We did not find any reports of KD therapy attempts in the KIF1A-related spectrum with which to compare. As to SCN8A-related epilepsy, a recent study showed that KD therapy was effective in 55.56% (5/9) of patients [50]. Despite poor outcomes reported by other authors and us, there are some cases in which the KD could be of benefit for treatment.",a6cf7cac-9a9e-4c74-b1c8-17c1c9da90d1
18,methods18,"  At the same time, the syndromes with unknown genetic backgrounds, in which a significant improvement is observed after KD treatment, include DS, febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), and super-drug-resistant status epilepticus [51,52]. Indeed, we found that in the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) group, patients with a DS (2/5) and juvenile epilepsy with absence seizures (JAE) (1/1) diagnosis achieved full seizure resolution. Furthermore, a favorable effect (>90% seizure reduction) was also obtained in AS-like (1/2), DS (1/5), Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) (1/3), and RS-like (1/3) patients. However, the KD treatment was ineffective in all (7/7) unknown etiology (UNFE) patients. Unfortunately, this was also the case in some of the DS (1/5), Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) (2/3), and RS-like (1/3) patients.  Overall, we found that the KD treatment was effective in 90% (18/20) of KE and 50% (11/22) of undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) patients.",19d27c7c-e65e-45ce-a091-fe27336bd561
19,methods19," Thus, it was more effective in patients with a known genetic underlying disease cause.  Regarding KD treatment effectiveness, a frequently raised issue is the type of seizures [33]. In agreement with available reports, we found that the partial seizure group had the worst response to treatment [34,53]. Firstly, both in the case of their co-occurrence and independent occurrence, they were the most challenging seizure type to be reduced—71.43% (15/21). Secondly, partial seizures were a statistically significant factor of worse response to the treatment. However, it should be taken into account that these data apply to all patients, and most partial seizures (15/21) occurred in the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) group. If only patients with known etiology are considered, partial seizures occurred in six cases, where the KD proved to be effective in 83.33% (5/6) of them.  Furthermore, partial seizures were the only seizure type in 9.52% (4/42) patients.",66be241c-49f7-4c21-b814-0c71008f6e4d
20,methods20," In the case of the KE group, there was one patient with a complete reduction in seizures, and in the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) group, three patients with a 50% reduction, considered ineffective. Therefore, it seems that partial seizures should not discourage us from choosing the KD treatment, and we should be guided by knowledge of the underlying pathology. It should also be noted that a similar unfavorable correlation was seen with tonic-clonic seizures occurring as the only type. In most such cases (60%, 6/10), the KD was ineffective. Among other KD-resistant seizure types, atonic 41.66% (5/12), and myoclonic 25.32% (5/19) seizures were less often reported.  Due to side effects and the need to maintain a dietary regime, KD therapy is associated with the risk of withdrawal. In the group analyzed by us, the treatment was discontinued by 38.10% (16/42), while other studies have reported 33.5–35% [52,54].",6a3a98f2-d71d-4c3f-bd83-96c0aa76d750
21,methods21," In the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) group, the percentage of withdrawal was 50.0% and correlated precisely with the clinical assessment of KD ineffectiveness. However, in the KE group, it was 25.0% (5/20), while treatment was ineffective only in 10.0% of cases (2/20). This may indicate that the threshold for the effectiveness of KD therapy, being >50% reduction of seizures, adopted in many studies, does not meet parents’ expectations in some cases. In particular, the positive perception of the treatment effect may be influenced by other factors, such as the general improvement in cognitive function. According to the parents’ opinions, there was only a 75.0% improvement in cognitive function in the KE group. At the same time, there was 90.0% effectiveness in seizure reduction.  Our results also indicate that effective KD treatment was accompanied by a reduction in the ASDs used. In both the KE and undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) groups, this percentage was similar, 40.",2826ac6d-8d8f-4d3f-8ec4-68f94a88a3af
22,methods22,"0% vs. 36.4%. However, importantly, there was much less need to add another ASD in the KE group despite KD therapy (25.0% vs. 54.5%). The situation of possible drug reduction was also more favorable in the case of non-partial seizures (42.9%), where, in the case of partial seizures, it was 33.3%. It is worth noting that the KD does not affect the level of ASDs in the blood serum of children and adolescents [55,56]. Hence, the possibility of reducing the number of ASDs is closely related to the effectiveness of the KD. However, one report suggested a decreased efficacy of the KD among patients receiving lamotrigine [57]. In a group analyzed by us, only two patients received lamotrigine, and both achieved effective seizure reduction. Moreover, the Dravet syndrome cohort study showed that even in those without dramatic seizure reduction, there was an improvement in quality of life, and the number of ASDs was lowered to one or two [54].  Another aspect of the KD effectiveness is its type.",8c7e4a1a-60f8-419d-a4fb-220e5f0adf97
23,methods23," Previous studies have not reported any correlation between the diet used and reducing a specific type of seizures [27,58,59]. We have also not found a superiority of a particular KD in terms of overall and type of seizure reduction. Therefore, it is likely that its general tolerance and clinical experience should determine the choice of a specific KD.  As for the tolerance of the KD, we did not find any diet to have significantly more or fewer side effects. Other authors have suggested that the modified Atkins diet (MAD) could have a lower number of side effects than the classical KD [60]. We did not observe such a correlation, and in terms of adverse effects, our data showed 21.4% (3/14) in the classical KD and 30.8% (4/13) in the modified Atkins diet (MAD). Interestingly, we noticed that complaints were higher in the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) group than in the KE group, 63.6% vs. 36.4%.",4baa745b-ecba-4fc5-a0bc-98e96f4cc9b6
24,methods24," Probably responsible for this effect was the greater number of ASDs taken in the undetermined genetic etiology (UNKE) group. Patients in this group used three or more ASDs in 40.9% of the cases, compared to the KE group, 25.0%. However, other causes cannot be excluded.  Lastly, we would like to emphasize the importance of our findings concerning the latest ILAE Classification of the Epilepsies [61]. It suggests a division into three categories: focal epilepsy, generalized epilepsy, or epileptic encephalopathy, and development encephalopathy. It is well-known that patients with encephalopathies can suffer from both focal and generalized seizures. In this respect, we obtained the following KD effectiveness groups: focal seizures only (25.0%), tonic-clonic seizures only (40.0%), simultaneous focal and tonic-clonic seizures (52.9%). This suggests that the identification of focal seizures does not necessarily imply a lower efficacy of KD.",b94b9245-d243-44eb-a174-475a00adde1f
25,methods25," On the contrary, provided it is not the only form of episode, this suggests the possibility of the KD’s higher efficacy. Additionally, these results exemplify the practical usefulness of the new proposed classification in identifying patients who might benefit from KD as a form of treatment.  5. Conclusions  Based on obtained data, it can be concluded that treatment with the KD is a safe and effective form of epilepsy therapy. Because of the KD, the overall usage of ASDs was reduced. The KD was the least effective in reducing focal seizures in both known and unknown etiology groups. The most significant benefit from this form of treatment can be expected in patients who have both focal and generalized seizures, that is, in a group of patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies of known molecular or cytogenetic background. Finding the occurrence of focal seizures in a patient with epilepsy does not exclude this form of anti-seizure treatment.",a7e1852d-d502-4637-9066-c73bc5bdfbff
26,methods26," The new proposed ILAE Classification and Definition of Epilepsy Syndromes can significantly help estimate the potential benefit of dietary treatment and allow earlier use of this form of therapy. Considering the effectiveness and minor side effects of dietary treatment, it seems reasonable to recommend this form of treatment in all patients with epilepsy. The search for the genetic basis of epilepsy seems reasonable in all patients, both in patients with generalized and focal seizures, in the case of epilepsy or epileptic encephalopathy.
