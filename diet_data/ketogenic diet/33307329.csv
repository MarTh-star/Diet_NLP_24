28,results11," To determine whether β-HB affects PES1 regulated SREBP1c activity, acetylation assays both in vitro and in vivo were performed. Additionally, co-IP was used to explore the interaction between p300 and SREBP1c. We found that Pes1 silence in hepatocytes reduced the interaction between p300 and SREBP1c (Fig. 6b). Contrastingly, Pes1 overexpression increased the interaction, which was however impaired under β-HB treatment (Fig. 6c). Subsequently, β-HB treatment in hepatocytes inhibited the acetylation of SREBP1c (Fig. 6d). Next, whether the acetylation of SREBP1c is regulated by PES1 in vivo was also investigated. Our current data indicated that Pes1 knockout in mice significantly reduced the interaction between p300 and SREBP1c (Fig. 6e).

Simultaneously, KD led to much less inflammation responses in mice than did SD, as indicated by decreased pro-inflammatory factor levels (IL-1β and IL-18) in the murine livers (Fig. 7c), similar to the results of β-HB treated hepatocytes (Fig. 7d–f).

34,discussion0," Recently, clinical studies indicated that KD was effective in improving metabolic parameters of weight, glycemia, and lipid profiles in patients with overweight or obesity, especially in those with preexisting diabetes (Choi et al. 2020; Li and Heber 2020). In our current study, although the high glucose level is naturally dropped in KKAy murine model after age of 18 weeks according to the literature (Zhang et al. 2020), we still observed the effects of KD on lowering plasma glucose and improving insulin sensitivity in T2DM mice compared with those of SD, which was consistent with previous publication (Yang et al. 2021). In addition, Guo et al. (2020) also reported that the plasma and hepatic TG levels were evidently dropped in normal and T2DM mice fed by KD, which are exactly resembling to our current study.",bde93f9e-23d5-4d28-9c25-62cdc3da2691
35,discussion1,"  β-HB, as the predominant component of ketone bodies, has been demonstrated to serve as molecular scaffold that regulates cellular function by directly activating hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptors, and to be involved in multiple physiological processes including metabolism and inflammation (Offermanns 2017. In this study, the levels of β-HB in normal mice were higher than those in diabetic mice after KD treatment. This may be because the ketone bodies are produced by fatty acid β-oxidation, which is upregulated by carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) (Puchalska and Crawford 2017). Similarly, 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) is a rate-limiting enzyme that promotes β-HB synthesis as well (Shimazu et al. 2010). In our current work, although the expression of CPT1 and HMGCS2 by KD treatment is higher than that by SD in both C57BL/6J and KKAy mice, the latter ones fed with SD or KD had much less expression of CPT1 and HMGCS2 than the previous ones (Additional file 1: Fig.",3b16e8e7-c228-4cc4-ad27-08a5ad8118dc
36,discussion2," S3). These results suggested that the β-HB levels in KKAy mice may be lower than those in C57BL/6J mice after 16-week treatment with the same KD, as shown in our Fig. 1i. In addition, emerging evidence from long-term KD intervention in humans supports that the ketone level was also attenuated in T2DM patients (Landry et al. 2021). And the initial β-HB value was below ketosis level at the beginning of the KD treatment (0.12 mmol/L), then peaked at 1.1 mmol/L (4 weeks) and decreased to 0.51 mmol/L by week 12 in the end (Landry et al. 2021). Moreover, β-HB levels are significantly different among different mice by KD intervention based on previous reports. For example, the β-HB levels in db/db mice were dramatically higher than those in wild type mice after KD intervention, while the enhanced degree of β-HB levels in ob/ob mice relative to their controls fed with the same KD were much lower than that in db/db mice (Thio et al. 2006; Poplawski et al. 2011; Badman et al. 2009).",dc810b52-105f-4d05-92b8-0fe6baa77857
37,discussion3," Furthermore, our current data indicated that the elevation fold of β-HB level in KKAy mice was even moderately higher than that in C57BL/6J mice comparing KD feeding to SD, but no significant difference between two ratios was observed (Additional file 1: Fig. S4). Additionally, the fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-IR and TG levels were markedly reduced in KD-fed KKAy mice compared with SD-fed controls, suggesting the effective intervention by KD-derived β-HB levels in vivo. Taken together, although the ketogenesis by KD was seemingly mitigated in KKAy mice compared with that in C57BL/6J mice, the ketone level was still legitimate for effectiveness in KKAy mice in our current study based on the preceding findings and present results.  Of note, we discerned that PES1 levels were downregulated by KD feeding in normal and diabetic mice and by β-HB treatment in cells. Previous finding indicated that circANRIL could play an important role in atheroprotection by inhibiting PES1 (Holdt et al.",04f31610-5a09-4ce5-b1d4-4eadd8b2c798
38,discussion4," 2016). Moreover, our current study unveiled that β-HB may reduce CHOP binding to Pes1 promoter, resulting in the downregulation of PES1. The decreased PES1 protein level impaired its binding to p300 and Caspase1 promoters, causing the declined expressions of p300 and Caspase1, thus undermining p300 mediated acetylation of SREBP1c and inflammation response. CHOP, a key apoptosis-promoting factor, tightly controls the gene transcription and has pivotal roles in lipid accumulation, adipogenesis and inflammatory action (Liu et al. 2018; Maris et al. 2012; Allagnat et al. 2012). And one report has indicated that KD intervention in mice could reduce the expression of CHOP (Yu et al. 2020), which is consistent to our current study. In addition, it has also been proposed that SREBP1c binds to its lipogenic target genes, such as fatty acid synthase (fatty acid synthase (FASN)) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), thereby stimulating de novo lipogenesis (Li et al. 2015).",3410f98c-f865-4cdd-87df-a13572fec5f3
39,discussion5," A crucial role of SREBP1c has been shown in vivo by hepatic overexpression of SREBP1c in transgenic mice that led to increased hepatic lipid accumulation (Wang et al. 2015). Accumulating evidence showed that the acetylation of SREBP1c increased its stability and activity, and SREBP1c is acetylated by p300 at Lys-289 and Lys-309 (Ponugoti et al. 2010). In this report, after Pes1 gene was knocked down, the interaction between SREBP1c and p300 was significantly inhibited, consistent with our observation in Pes1-conditional knockout (CKO) mice. Moreover, the interaction between SREBP1c and p300 was obviously strengthened during Pes1 gene overexpression, which was however impeded by β-HB treatment. Furthermore, our current study also suggested that β-HB and KD remarkably reduced the SREBP1c activity via inhibiting the acetylation of SREBP1c.  Compelling evidence based on animal study suggested that KD may block NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β and IL-18 production (Youm et al.",2241d008-0bbd-4c49-956f-69ae4ab92de2
40,discussion6," 2015), which is in concordance with our current observation. In addition, after in vitro knockdown of Pes1 and in vivo ablation of Pes1, the expression of NLRP3, Caspase1 and gasdermin D (GSDMD) was significantly inhibited. This is opposite to that after overexpression of Pes1 in vitro. However, the Pes1 overexpression induced effect was abolished by β-HB treatment. These results suggested that β-HB plays a vital role in regulation of inflammation response by downregulating PES1. Moreover, Caspase1 and NLRP3, as regulatory molecules of lipid metabolism, were reported to promote the release of mature IL-1β and to interfere insulin signaling and production, subsequently leading to the lipogenesis and fat accumulation (Anand 2020). Based on Caspase1 knockdown in hepatocytes, our current data exhibit that medium and cellular TG levels are clearly curbed, which is similar to the protection role in Caspase1 knockout mice fed with high fat diet (Stienstra et al. 2011).",0724c295-2239-4fbe-a8ca-5fde77c101d4
41,discussion7," Collectively, these results suggest that both β-HB treatment in cells and KD feeding in mice greatly reduced lipid production or accumulation via downregulating PES1 modulated acetylation of SREBP1c and inflammation pathways.  The current study explored a novel mechanism of KD intervention in diabetic mice, which may have translational potential and clinical implications by finding a PES1 inhibitor. However, the interpretation of this study so far is still limited due to the lack of human intervention data, and PES1 function and its mediated mechanism by KD intervention in human is needed in future. In addition, the metabolic factors regulating PES1 expression under T2DM condition are not elucidated yet.  Conclusion  In summary, our current findings demonstrate that KD may ameliorate lipid deposition in type 2 diabetic mice by downregulating PES1 modulated acetylation of SREBP1c and inflammation pathways.",c0225851-d740-48a1-b46c-2af239e21768
