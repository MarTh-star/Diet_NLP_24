0,abstract0," Disease-causing variants in STXBP1 are among the most common genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the phenotypic spectrum in STXBP1-related disorders is wide and clear correlations between variant type and clinical features have not been observed so far.  Here, we harmonized clinical data across 534 individuals with STXBP1-related disorders and analysed 19 973 derived phenotypic terms, including phenotypes of 253 individuals previously unreported in the scientific literature. The overall phenotypic landscape in STXBP1-related disorders is characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities in 95% and seizures in 89% of individuals, including focal-onset seizures as the most common seizure type (47%). More than 88% of individuals with STXBP1-related disorders have seizure onset in the first year of life, including neonatal seizure onset in 47%.",4b3b59e3-817c-45dd-882d-6ef25167c976
1,abstract1," Individuals with protein-truncating variants and deletions in STXBP1 (n = 261) were almost twice as likely to present with West syndrome and were more phenotypically similar than expected by chance. Five genetic hotspots with recurrent variants were identified in more than 10 individuals, including p.Arg406Cys/His (n = 40), p.Arg292Cys/His/Leu/Pro (n = 30), p.Arg551Cys/Gly/His/Leu (n = 24), p.Pro139Leu (n = 12), and p.Arg190Trp (n = 11). None of the recurrent variants were significantly associated with distinct electroclinical syndromes, single phenotypic features, or showed overall clinical similarity, indicating that the baseline variability in STXBP1-related disorders is too high for discrete phenotypic subgroups to emerge.",a35d4106-af69-46eb-bcc2-28437d0b33ef
2,abstract2," We then reconstructed the seizure history in 62 individuals with STXBP1-related disorders in detail, retrospectively assigning seizure type and seizure frequency monthly across 4433 time intervals, and retrieved 251 anti-seizure medication prescriptions from the electronic medical records. We demonstrate a dynamic pattern of seizure control and complex interplay with response to specific medications particularly in the first year of life when seizures in STXBP1-related disorders are the most prominent. Adrenocorticotropic hormone and phenobarbital were more likely to initially reduce seizure frequency in infantile spasms and focal seizures compared to other treatment options, while the ketogenic diet was most effective in maintaining seizure freedom.",7dabca62-cbbe-4649-bcf4-ff9f93514b2d

5,abstract6,"1,2 The role of STXBP1 variants in human neurological disorders was initially identified in Ohtahara syndrome,3 but subsequent studies have identified a broader range of other neurological features.2,4,5 However, in contrast to other genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders,6,7STXBP1-related disorders have received relatively little attention to understanding genotype–phenotype correlations.  Knowledge about the function of STXBP1 precedes its discovery as a disease gene. STXBP1 encodes the syntaxin-binding protein 1, Sec1/Munc18-1, a synaptic vesicle protein involved in vesicle release.8 Munc18-1 is a key organizer of the neuronal SNARE complex, the molecular machine driving synaptic vesicle fusion.9,10 Homozygous Munc18 knockout mice have no synaptic transmission, emphasizing the crucial role of Sec1/Munc18 in the presynapse.11 In addition, the role of STXBP1 has been recognized in the Golgi complex and intracellular trafficking.",3bf5c349-9dcf-475e-aabf-7da7434bc8f1
6,abstract7,"12,13 The main disease mechanism in STXBP1-related disorders is haploinsufficiency.14 However, possible dominant-negative effects15 and gain-of-function effects16 have also been suggested.  Since the initial discovery of STXBP1, genetic variants in other genes encoding presynaptic proteins have been found to cause neurodevelopmental disorders, including genes that encode components of the presynaptic fusion machinery such as SNAP25, VAMP2 or STX1B.8,17-19 Synaptic vesicle recycling also represents a prominent disease mechanism, and we have previously identified disease-causing variants in DNM1 and AP2M1 in neurodevelopmental disorders.20,21  There are several reasons why research on STXBP1-related disorders faces obstacles. First, the overall phenotypic spectrum of STXBP1-related disorders is broad, including a wide range of epilepsy presentations and neurological features.3,22–27 Second, no clear genotype–phenotype correlations have been identified to date.",526b8a98-71e0-4eda-9c93-6030390aa072
7,abstract8,"2 Third, as STXBP1 encodes for a synaptic protein, the pathogenic mechanism linking impaired release of synaptic vesicles to neurological features is less clear than, for example, ion channel-related disorders. Only recently have specific strategies targeting the function of Munc18-1 been suggested. Some of these strategies, such as pharmacological chaperones for protein stabilization, are expected to be assessed in clinical trials soon.15  Analysis of clinical features linked to neurodevelopmental disorders has previously been performed in a non-standardized way, using a variety of templates and case-report forms. Methods based on controlled vocabularies and bio-ontologies allow for heterogeneous clinical data to be harmonized across a wide range of sources.28 The Human Phenotype Ontology (Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)) is emerging as the lingua franca in the field and is widely used in clinical laboratory and research settings.",f081ac57-cc7f-4503-b06d-ba1d43fa4f71

We searched PubMed for studies using the search term ‘STXBP1’ and identified variants using the Human Gene Mutation Database Professional 2020.2. A total of 253 additional individuals were included through an international collaborative network on STXBP1-related disorders, including Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, USA (n = 63, Institutional Review Board #12226); University of Genoa, Italy (n = 46); Beijing University First Hospital, China (n = 37); University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany (n = 21); Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, Spain (n = 16); University Medical Center Amsterdam, Netherlands (n = 14); Boston Children’s Hospital (n = 13); University Hospital Antwerp, Belgium (n = 9); Danish Epilepsy Center, Denmark (n = 9); Children’s Hospital Colorado, USA (n = 8); University of Cambridge,",355f7701-519c-4387-9100-e3b385e0c310

Regarding copy number variations, we did not include individuals with deletions/duplications involving other genes in addition to STXBP1.

To compare the frequency of clinical features in specific patient subgroups versus the remainder of the cohort, we used ‘phenograms’ as previously described,31,32 highlighting phenotypic features with a nominal P-value ≤ 0.05.  Phenotypic similarity analysis  We used a standard phenotypic similarity assessment31,34 to determine whether individuals of a certain subgroup were more related than expected by chance.",106af02b-a794-4054-80bc-401d44af6e53
14,methods4," In brief, phenotypic similarity was assessed by comparing shared clinical features between individuals, weighing the contribution of each feature by its frequency in the overall cohort (Supplementary material). Exact P-values were determined by comparing observed versus expected phenotypic similarity based on permutational testing of 100 000 equally sized groups with randomly selected individuals from the larger cohort.  Reconstruction of epilepsy history including seizure types and seizure frequencies in monthly intervals  To reconstruct seizure history in the Epilepsy Genetics Research Project (Epilepsy Genetics Research Project (EGRP)) cohort (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, USA, n = 62), we retrospectively reviewed clinical records, identifying the presence or absence of seizures within monthly time intervals and coding seizure types using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms.",8bd428e2-db5e-4be3-959c-90b22cc6a003

The combined format allowed for the assessment of seizures in three dimensions, including time, seizure type and seizure frequency, and allowed us to determine whether an individual had seizures within each one-month time increment, what type of seizures the individual had and how frequent the seizures were. We then compared seizure frequency as ordinal variables referred to as seizure frequency (SF) scores: multiple daily seizures (>5 per day, SF score = 5), several daily seizures (2–5 per day, SF score = 4), daily seizures (SF score = 3), weekly seizures (SF score = 2), monthly seizures (SF score = 1), no seizures (SF score = 0).",124760a7-6712-4904-9b80-32dbd5fd9485
16,methods6," When assessing seizure frequency on a group level, we used median seizure frequency and displayed the range of values. For individuals who were reported to have seizures but the seizure frequency was not available from chart review, we assigned the median seizure frequency of other individuals who had seizures in the respective time interval during which the seizure frequency was unknown. While this subcohort only accounted for 12% of the overall cohort, we aimed to leverage the maximum amount of information that could be derived where in-depth longitudinal information was available in the medical records.  Reconstruction of anti-seizure medications using a hybrid approach of EMR data extraction and manual review  We extracted prescriptions for the most common anti-seizure medications (anti seizure medications (ASM)) from the electronic medical records (EMRs) at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.",53c4a8d7-b5b2-42b2-a65b-962ba0d7ee23
17,methods7,"34 In several individuals with adrenocorticotropic hormone (adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)) treatment for infantile spasms, the treatment effect was so rapid that binning into monthly seizure severity scores failed to capture the sequence of medication initiation and resolution of spasms. In these cases, we adjusted the time intervals accordingly to reflect the correct sequence of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration and seizure improvement. We defined discrete episodes of anti seizure medications (ASM) use as the time between first and last prescription and assumed that anti seizure medications (ASM) use during this episode was uninterrupted. We reviewed all patient charts for the presence of additional anti seizure medications (ASM) and manually added information on prednisolone use for seizure treatment, performed according to the United Kingdom Infantile Spasms Study (United Kingdom Infantile Spasms Study (UKISS)) at our institution,37 and the ketogenic diet.",3f0add7f-43d4-4709-874f-a46cd9e62c21

Assessment of comparative anti-seizure medication effectiveness  We assessed the comparative effectiveness of the anti seizure medications (ASM) by analysing the frequency of intervals with seizure improvement coinciding with medication use compared to the frequency of intervals with seizure improvement without the use of the medication. For example, we assessed the number of monthly intervals in which levetiracetam was prescribed and the change in seizure frequency during these intervals based on preceding intervals compared to the change in seizure frequency across intervals in which individuals received a medication other than levetiracetam.",b4a97431-d86b-4c1f-94ae-9b05abcc05ab
19,methods9," We defined reduction in seizure frequency as an improvement or decrease in seizure frequency scores within a monthly interval. For example, an individual with multiple daily seizures (>5 per day, SF score = 5) during 2 months of age that evolved to weekly seizures (SF score = 2) by 3 months of age was defined to have a reduction in seizures. We defined seizure freedom as having no seizures (SF score = 0) across consecutive time intervals. Using this information, we derived odds ratios using Fisher’s exact test for three assessments of comparative effectiveness: (i) the odds ratio of seizure frequency reduction; (ii) the odds ratio of seizure frequency reduction or continuing seizure freedom; and (iii) the odds ratio of continuing seizure freedom only. The latter measure was based on the rationale that some anti seizure medications (ASM) may be initially effective in reducing seizure frequency but not able to maintain continuing seizure freedom.

We previously demonstrated that clinically intuitive phenotype recognition can be replicated through computational algorithms, referred to as semantic similarity algorithms.31 These methods are particularly relevant as associations with single phenotypic features may underestimate clinical similarities within specific patient groups, especially when phenotypic features are rare.",e325d07f-6d1d-4458-a521-a24d579548a8

However, when we grouped all variants with known or suspected dominant-negative effects (n = 35) including p.Arg406His, p.Pro335Leu, p.Pro480Leu and p.Gly544Asp/Val, statistical significance was not reached with regards to clinical similarity and discrete phenotypic associations after correction for multiple comparisons (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Data harmonization in a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disease  STXBP1-related disorders pose a challenge in describing the clinical phenotype and outlining the phenotypic spectrum.

In addition, at least 38% of individuals were non-verbal in the age group above 11 years, highlighting the role of communication in STXBP1-related disorders.

48,discussion3," In future studies, prospective assessments using standardized outcome assessments of patient-level developmental features will be paramount, including assessment of non-verbal measures of cognition.  Several age-dependent features in STXBP1-related disorders may be underappreciated in the existing literature given the wide range of ages of individuals reported in the literature and recruited at collaborating clinical centres. For example, tremor and ataxia were identified in up to 40% of individuals above the age of 11 years, emphasizing that features such as movement disorders may be more common in older individuals than previously expected and may require further scrutiny in future studies focusing on the adult phenotypes of STXBP1-related disorders.  Seizure phenotypes in STXBP1-related disorders  We found that 89% of seizures in STXBP1-related disorders start in the first year of life.",3270b3cd-e2a3-43a1-aa44-84ba2411f65f

However, we acknowledge that long-term outcomes for most individuals are not available and that the true risk for seizure recurrence in STXBP1-related disorders remains unknown.  Infantile spasms were found in almost half of all individuals with STXBP1-related disorders who have seizures, a clinical feature that stands out within the context of the wider range of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Genotype–phenotype correlations for STXBP1 recurrent variants  Historically, STXBP1-related disorders are considered to present without clear genotype–phenotype correlations.2 For example, in contrast to ion channel disorders, where both gain-of-function and loss-of-function variants frequently result in vastly different phenotypes with distinct clinical features, medication responses and specific protein domains, STXBP1-related disorders were not observed to present with clear identifiable genomic features and clinical subgroups.  In clinical practice, genotype–phenotype associations in STXBP1-related disorders are subtle and evade the identification of distinct clinical constellations in individuals with shared molecular features.",ee3f0743-c524-46f5-95cf-4f8839fa2285

Given that the emerging phenotypic groups may reinforce different underlying disease mechanisms, further work to outline clinical subgroups in STXBP1-related disorders will be paramount. Surprisingly, none of the major recurrent variants in STXBP1 showed significant phenotypic similarity, in contrast to the main recurrent variants in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as SCN2A-related disorders.32 This lack of phenotypic similarity for recurrent variants indicates that when compared to the phenotypes of STXBP1-disorders as a whole, the baseline variability of phenotypic features is too high for single-phenotype associations to result in overall phenotypic similarity.",2cc747bc-849a-4ab0-aa13-a1f36b8b019a
52,discussion7," This negative result mirrors clinical experience and suggests that phenotypic patterns in STXBP1-related disorders are often not distinct enough to be recognized as subgroups.  However, emerging functional data suggest dominant-negative mechanisms for some of the recurrent STXBP1 variants, including p.Arg406His, p.Pro335Leu, p.Pro480Leu and p.Gly544Asp/Val.15 Accordingly, we assessed whether specific phenotypic features were nominally correlated with hotspot variants in STXBP1. We found that features associated with early onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE) before the typical age of infantile spasms, including EEG with suppression burst, were increased by a factor of two in individuals with p.Arg406Cys/His recurrent variants. Likewise, the frequency of spastic tetraplegia was increased almost 5-fold, while ataxia was less common as in the larger group of individuals with STXBP1-related disorders by more than 7-fold.",26ecd5b1-1a2d-4f42-bc2d-a8562312ca6c

In contrast, the frequency of infantile spasms was reduced more than 3-fold among individuals with p.Arg551Cys/Gly/His/Leu variants. None of the clinical features found to be associated with recurrent variants were exclusive to either carriers of recurrent variants or the larger population of individuals with STXBP1-related disorders. However, grouping all variants with known or suspected dominant-negative mechanisms did not result in statistically significant clinical similarity. This suggests that STXBP1-related disorders with presumed or known dominant-negative effects do not have a joint, recognizable phenotypic signature that sets this group of variants apart in our study.",55b4cbd4-5eec-435d-b064-3710fa68b3c1

While these single genotype–phenotype associations did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing, we found that individuals with PTV/dels were significantly more phenotypically similar than expected by chance. We believe that this information will help delineate strategies to stratify patients for future clinical studies by identifying individuals more likely to have specific variant classes as well as provide valuable information to our patients’ families.

55,discussion10," While seizures are most common between the ages of 4 and 5 months, reconstructing seizure types and seizure frequencies revealed a dynamic and heterogeneous pattern of seizure onset and offset in the first year of life. For example, during each month, only 40% of all individuals with seizures at some point during infancy had seizures, and the remaining 60% either had seizures that had occurred earlier, started later, or were temporarily controlled. This observation emphasizes the need for longitudinal assessments in future studies and clinical trials. STXBP1-related disorders represent a paradigmatic neurodevelopmental condition with heterogeneous phenotypic features that occur and remit over time, and these methods will allow for comparison with other neurodevelopmental disorders.

Our report of all known variants will allow for formal reclassification of these variants for individuals with uncertain diagnoses and highlight hotspots of recurrent variants that require further scrutiny with respect to the disease mechanism. Furthermore, this genetic information coupled with a phenotypic map of clinical phenotypes will allow clinicians to obtain a better understanding of the full range of clinical features to be expected in STXBP1-related disorders, including age-dependent features and phenotypes that are conspicuously absent. For example, status epilepticus, a common feature in many other DEEs, has a very low frequency in STXBP1-related disorders in our study.

The reconstruction of seizures histories in a subset of individuals provides an in-depth overview of the changing picture of STXBP1-related seizures, particularly during the first year of life when individuals are often misdiagnosed, and testing and treatment is frequently delayed.

Even though the number of individuals where information was available was limited, we found significant differences with respect to the effects of various anti-seizure medications that were dependent on seizure type and age. This information may provide clinicians with initial evidence with respect to effective therapies, including the beneficial effect of the ketogenic diet in maintaining seizure freedom.

60,discussion15," In summary, we present a descriptive study, outlining the complex clinical presentations in STXBP1-related disorders based on all available information within the literature and across an international network of collaborating centres.  Accordingly, our work includes three levels of data: a larger cohort with phenotypic information and limited longitudinal data (n = 534), a smaller cohort of individuals from a single centre where longitudinal data were available (n = 62) and a subset of this cohort where anti seizure medications (ASM) could be extracted from the medical records (n = 17). We acknowledge that the smaller number of individuals in these subgroups can limit the conclusions that can be drawn.",cbed8fb9-f4b9-4bde-af42-cb938de39af5

Conclusion  STXBP1-related disorders represent a perplexing group of neurodevelopmental disorders in which the broad range of neurodevelopmental features poses a conceptual difficulty in outlining phenotypic subgroups, genotype–phenotypic correlations and assessing drug response.
