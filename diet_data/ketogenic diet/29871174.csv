0,introduction0,"The relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis (relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis (RRMS)) is an immunologically mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)) [1]. The progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS)), namely primary progressive multiple sclerosis (primary progressive multiple sclerosis (Pprogressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS))) and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (Sprogressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS))), may have a different pathology [1].",8f580184-65a7-4743-8e27-897d6ccf59af
1,introduction1," Therapies used for relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis (RRMS) are unsuccessful for progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS) as neurodegeneration is seen without inflammation, and there is no disease-modifying medication at present, with many relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients transitioning to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (Sprogressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS)) within 15-20 years [2-3]. The ketogenic diet (KD) has beneficial effects in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, and could thus halt and reverse the progressive nature of progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS) [2]. We report here a case of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (Sprogressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS)) wherein the patient improved while on KD, worsened on stopping KD, and improved again upon restarting KD.  Case presentation A 60-year-old man had one episode of right mono-ocular blurring of vision in 1988 at 31 years of age.",3e5a837e-d881-4081-99f1-43f961cf9703
2,introduction2," After two years, he had several acute episodes of right upper limb and right lower limb weakness. Inspite of not taking any treatment, good improvement was seen in several days. MRI scans showed fluid attenuated inversion recovery (fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)) hyper intense demyelinating lesions in various locations within the brainstem, the periventricular cerebral white matter, the infra-tentorial region of cerebellum, the subcortical cerebral white matter, and the spinal cord consistent with relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The somato-sensory evoked potential studies, brainstem auditory evoked responses, and visual evoked responses were abnormal which were consistent with lesions in spinal cord, brain stem, and optic nerve respectively. The cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) analysis showed three oligoclonal bands (OCBs) but none in serum. The immunoglobin (IgG) index was also elevated (0.",28e74ab0-8600-4dd9-9149-97e5f6975692

All of the above parameters confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) as per the revised 2017 Macdonald criteria. There was no other possible etiology other than MS either clinically or on investigations. No further acute episodes were experienced for four to five years. Following this, there was progressive deterioration in his walking and balance with increase in spasticity, urgency of urine, and precipitancy. In 2015, he was put on the KD as a monotherapy. His baseline height was 165 cm and weight was 67.1 kg with an ideal body weight (ideal body weight (IBW)) of 65 kg. KD was started at a ketogenic ratio of 2.2:1 (ratio of fat to carbohydrate plus protein in grams) with 75% recommended dietary calorie allowance of 2600 Kcal and 25% calorie restriction (CR) to achieve ideal body weight (IBW) and later fine-tuned to maintain consistent urine ketones (UK) of 160 mg/dL (4+) and blood ketones on an average of 2.",65ce6547-a773-4bab-87b0-c964cdafe706

On KD, there was weight loss of 2 kg and his body weight was maintained on an average of 65 kg. Compliance and tolerability were good as ascertained by the patient’s diet diary and daily UK levels. He had no side-effects. He was assessed at regular intervals with the 25-foot walk, getting up from a chair, ascending and descending stairs, and expanded disability status scale (expanded disability status scale (EDSS)). Within a month, his balance and weakness improved and he maintained good bladder control. There was some deterioration observed in mid-2017 especially in walking and stairs test which could be attributed to slight irregularities in following KD. His physical evaluation is detailed in Table 1.  Table 1 Physical evaluation follow-up.

6,introduction6,"0 which worsened to 7.5 after stopping KD (Table 1). On restarting KD, in March 2018, there was not much improvement for the first few months due to severe deterioration in physical abilities during the period he was off KD. Therefore the evaluation of April 2018 did not show much improvement in his rating scores. However his expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score (6.0) improved (Table 1). MRI scans done in 2017 and 2019 showed improvement on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) with reduced intensity in lesions and no new lesions. However atrophy was seen on MRI in 2017 which worsened even further by 2019. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in 2017 showed two OCBs with none in serum. His IgG index remained elevated (0.7).

7,discussion0,"This patient had secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (Sprogressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS)) which showed definite improvement in expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores, the 25-foot walk, and other parameters (Table 1). On stopping KD, all scores worsened; upon restarting KD, all scores improved.  Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease with immune cells crossing a compromised blood-brain barrier [1]. However, in some cases of relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis (RRMS), neurodegeneration may be seen without inflammation, or there may be dissociation between the two processes as is also seen in Harding’s syndrome and Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy [1]. This may be caused by an initial neurodegeneration causing an inflammatory reaction due to cellular degenerative material [1].",24610841-80b1-4daa-970b-be9d5eaa687f
8,discussion1," Also, in most primary progressive multiple sclerosis (Pprogressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS)) and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (Sprogressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS)) cases, immunomodulatory, immunosuppressive and autologous stem cell transplant therapies are not as effective, possibly because though they reduce inflammation, they have no effect on neurodegeneration [1-2]. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS) as is evidenced by abnormal mitochondria in damaged axons and cortical neurons and normal mitochondrial function in axons that escape demyelination [2]. Reduction in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) also occurs, a phenomenon common to other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease [2].",7ffc9129-d705-4ca4-9b13-0be526980f8e
9,discussion2," Glucose hypometabolism is due to impaired mitochondrial metabolism and may play a significant role in disease progression in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS) [2, 4]. Thus, providing the brain with an alternative source of fuel like ketones may reduce the rate of neurodegeneration [2]. KD could be beneficial in the treatment of relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS) by various other mechanisms, too. KD suppresses inflammatory cytokines, increases CA1 hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and causes long-term potentiation which results in improved memory, learning, and motor ability in an relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis (RRMS) rat model [5]. KD suppresses inflammatory cytokines by regulating the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway and exerting neuroprotective effect [6].",bdf7763e-4fcc-47b7-8aab-943ce3ff2e91
10,discussion3," The anti-inflammatory effect of a KD might be explained through the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by beta-hydroxybutyrate (by beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB)) in a manner that is independent of starvation-induced mechanisms such as 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, autophagy, or glycolytic inhibition [2]. KD also reduces reactive oxygen species through uncoupling protein (uncoupling protein (UCP)) activity, especially uncoupling protein (UCP)2, uncoupling protein (UCP)4, and uncoupling protein (UCP)5 [2]. Subjects on a KD program had a modulation of microRNA’s targeting of specific genes thereby improving nutrient metabolism, signaling pathways, and neuroprotection [7]. Ketones are neuroprotective as they produce more energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate and reactive oxygen species production is reduced, thereby leading to less overall cellular stress for brain cells [2].",af4daf97-74d5-460d-a3a0-29511e457ae6
11,discussion4," by beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has a direct, dose-dependent inhibitory activity on class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) including HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC4 [2]. KD raises glutathione levels in the hippocampus of rats through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor pathway [2]. Mitochondrial biogenesis within the rat hippocampus and cerebellar vermis is increased by the KD [5]. Although the precise pathway for this is not known, it is thought to involve the PGC-1𝛼 family of transcriptional coactivators, which promote transcription factors including NRF-1, NRF-2, and ERR𝛼 [2]. There has been only one study done by Johns Hopkins School of Medicine on MS where they found that CR was feasible and led to safe weight loss in relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients [8]. However, they did not analyze the efficacy of CR on treating relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis (RRMS) symptoms [8].",237a2292-a421-463e-baf2-26d718a49086
12,discussion5," Our patient improved on KD, his condition deteriorated when he stopped KD, and then improved again on restarting KD. There is a paucity of human studies on the use of KD in neurodegenerative disorders, and none in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (Sprogressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS)).  Conclusions This case raises the possibility that the mode of action of KD could represent a potential therapy for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (Sprogressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS)). However, large multi-center and randomized trials should be undertaken to better elucidate the complex relationship of KD vis-a-vis the etiopathology of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (Sprogressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS)).
