0,introduction0,"The ketogenic diet (KD), a proven treatment for medically intractable epilepsy [1], results in prominent production of ketones (notably, D-β-hydroxybutyrate [BHB] and acetoacetate [ACA]). Increasingly, ketones have been shown to exert neuroprotective actions in models of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), likely by restoration of impaired mitochondrial metabolism and antioxidant capacity [2,3]. A common pathogenic feature of NDs is oxidative stress which correlates closely with progressive tissue injury, and when the hippocampus is affected, results in cognitive and memory deficits. Conversely, a synthetic BHB ester-linked polymer, KTX-0101, and dietary ketosis are shown to mitigate memory deficits in patients of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [4,5] In line with this, ketones attenuate impairment of hippocampal cognitive function in a model of AD [6].",4b2f71c7-4e5b-4b3b-9438-f0ec78bac2fb
1,introduction1," Further, in vitro studies have demonstrated a crucial role for ketones in preserving hippocampal synaptic integrity in the face of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction [3,7]. However, the specific mechanisms underlying their beneficial actions remain unclear.  ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels act as metabolic sensors, coupling cellular metabolism with neuronal activity by enhancing K+ efflux. It is well known that plasmalemmal or surface KATP (sKATP) channels are activated under conditions of metabolic stress [8–10]. KATP channels localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane (i.e., mitoKATP channels) may regulate mitochondrial homeostasis by modulating electron transport and calcium buffering [11]. Both sKATP and mitoKATP channels have been implicated in models of tissue injury, notably in the heart and brain [11–14]. Activation of these channels may inhibit mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT), a critical determinant of cell death [15–18].",707d9940-9759-449f-9c5a-501658e00d54
2,introduction2," Recently, Yellen and colleagues reported that ketones inhibit spontaneous firing of substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons through sKATP channels, likely by increasing their open probability [19,20]. In the present study, we sought to determine whether the functional neuroprotective effects of ketones against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation (long term potentiation (LTP)) are mediated through either sKATP and/or mitoKATP channels.

3,methods0,"Preparation of hippocampal slices and electrophysiology All animal handling protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the Barrow Neurological Institute (Protocol number 405/308) and the University of Calgary (AC11-0047). Transverse hippocampal slices (400-μm thickness) were prepared from brains of 5- to 6-week-old Sprague Dawley rats or Kir6.2KO mice (Kir6.2−/−). Age-matched Kir6.2+/+ mice (wild-type mice; WT) were used as controls. Following decapitation, the whole brain was rapidly isolated and submerged in ice-cold oxygenated physiological saline (composition in mM: 124 NaCl, 1.8 MgSO4, 4 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 2.4 CaCl2, and 10 D-glucose; pH: 7.4).

An input-output curve (i.e., stimulus intensity vs. excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) amplitude) was constructed and the baseline excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) amplitude (over 1 mV) was set to 30–40% of the maximum response. To measure changes in synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (long term potentiation (LTP)) was evoked by theta-burst stimulation (theta burst stimulation (TBS)) consisting of 5 spike trains delivered at 0.2 Hz (each train, five stimuli at 0.1ms, 100 Hz). long term potentiation (LTP) is a form of synaptic plasticity broadly used as an electrophysiological measure of learning and memory. long term potentiation (LTP) was expressed as the percent of mean baseline excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) amplitude.",32753dd0-83b1-4eed-b282-155a86dafb1c

Perfusion of 2 mM H2O2 in hippocampal slices gradually led to a decrease in baseline excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) amplitude, and an eventual failure of theta burst stimulation (TBS) to induce long term potentiation (LTP) (Fig. 1A, D).

Having established the adverse effects of H2O2, we then examined the effects of ketones on oxidative impairment of hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP). Since brain and serum ketone levels have been reported to be in the range of 0.5–5 mM during the suckling period in immature rodents and during treatment with the KD in humans [23–26], we used a similar concentration range (BHB or ACA; each 1 to 3 mM) in this study.",a3a34bba-1422-4380-b425-313bd091b15e

In contrast, long term potentiation (LTP) was sustained following co-application of a ketone cocktail (ACA and BHB, each 1 mM) and 200 μM H2O2; there was no difference between the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) amplitude of ketone-treated hippocampal slices compared to controls (Fig. 1C, D).

Next, we determined whether ketones would preserve normal hippocampal synaptic transmission when challenged with H2O2. Synaptic transmission was progressively depressed during perfusion of 2 mM H2O2; the PS amplitude measured 18 ± 3% of baseline after a 15 min infusion with 2 mM H2O2, and then recovered to 84 ± 5% of baseline following a 30 min washout (Fig. 1E). Despite a clear deficit in long term potentiation (LTP) produced by 200 μM H2O2, changes in PS amplitude were not seen in the presence of 200 μM H2O2 (Fig. 1E).

Additionally, a 30-min washout restored the PS amplitude to 92 ± 5.4% of baseline (Fig. 1E, F). The synaptic protection was potentiated in hippocampal slices with a 10 min pre-incubation with ketones (Fig. 1F). The PS amplitude of the ketone pre-incubated group was significantly different than that seen when a ketone cocktail and H2O2 were co-applied after a 30 min infusion (p< 0.05; Fig. 1F).

18,results8,"  Activation of KATP channels provides synaptic protection against H2O2  Diazoxide (DZ) is an activator of both sKATP and mitoKATP channels, and has been demonstrated to exert cellular protective effects in pre-ischemic preconditioning and against oxidative injury [16,27]. While both types of KATP channels have clearly been shown to mediate neuroprotective actions under various pathological conditions, their effects on synaptic neurotransmission have yet to be fully elucidated. To investigate whether KATP channels affect synaptic transmission, we tested the effects of DZ on the reduction in PS amplitude caused by H2O2. Upon co-application of 300 μM DZ plus 2 mM H2O2, the PS amplitude remained constant and similar to control values (Fig. 2A, B). Further, when DZ was pre-incubated with 300 μM H2O2 for 10 min, no differences in PS amplitude were seen compared to controls (Fig. 2A).",6361cf9c-0e77-48b5-b232-566a62abcba6

However, one-way ANOVA did not find any overall difference amongst the experimental groups. Collectively, these data indicate that the activation of KATP channels in response to DZ can suppress synaptic impairment in oxidative stress, leading to restoration of synaptic integrity.

However, a serial infusion of 200 μM 5HD that included a cocktail of ketones (ACA and BHB, 1 mM each) and 2 mM H2O2 at 10 min intervals resulted in a tendency toward synaptic depression. 5HD exerted a similar blockade when 100 μM DZ was used, but increasing the DZ concentration to 300 μM negated this action of 5HD (Fig. 3A).

Hence, to determine which, or if both, channels are involved in the protective effects of ketones, we utilized Kir6.2 knockout (KO) mice lacking the expression of sKATP channels, but still retain functional mitoKATP channels [30]. theta burst stimulation (TBS) produced robust long term potentiation (LTP) in slices from wild-type (WT or Kir6.2+/+) mice. Hippocampal slices from WT mice exposed to H2O2 showed impairment of long term potentiation (LTP) at 60 min following theta burst stimulation (TBS).",4e8ceb75-f1da-4649-98c1-3b38a607c62e
30,results20," As with rat hippocampal slices, the long term potentiation (LTP) deficit induced by H2O2 in WT mice was reversed by co-application of either ketones or DZ (Fig. 4A, E). In Kir6.2-/- mice, theta burst stimulation (TBS) produced intact hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) (8 slices from 4 mice; Fig. 4B, E), and H2O2 induced a degree of long term potentiation (LTP) impairment similar to that seen in WT slices treated with H2O2 (Fig. 4B, E). Application of either ketones or DZ along with H2O2 did not fully preserve long term potentiation (LTP) formation in hippocampal slices from Kir6.2-/- mice (8 slices from 4 mice; Fig. 4C, E). In agreement with our long term potentiation (LTP) data, working memory deficits in Kir6.2 KO mice were age-dependent manner; disruption was seen at 12 weeks of age but not at 5 weeks [31].  10.1371/journal.pone.0119316.g004Fig 4 Both mitochondrial- and surface- KATP channels are necessary for ketone-mediated synaptic protection.",114fabd1-bc49-4309-ac32-e49873631c40
31,results21," (A) theta burst stimulation (TBS)-evoked intact long term potentiation (LTP) in wild–type slices decayed to baseline levels 60 min after H2O2 application but was maintained in slices incubated with either ketones or DZ (n = 10 slices; 5 WT mice; *** p < 0.001). (B) Loss of functional Kir6.2 channels did not affect theta burst stimulation (TBS)-induced long term potentiation (LTP). However, long term potentiation (LTP) in Kir6.2 KO slices was impaired by H2O2 to a basal level indistinguishable from WT slices exposed to H2O2. (C) Partial blockade of long term potentiation (LTP) in Kir6.2 KO mice. Changes in long term potentiation (LTP) from Kir6.2 KO slices were observed in the presence of either ketones (ACA and BHB, each 1 mM) or DZ (100 μM) with H2O2 (200 μM). In contrast, addition of 5-HD in this condition resulted in the complete blockade of long term potentiation (LTP) formation (n = 8 slices from 4 KO mice).",0faf7983-8513-4f92-a537-7050d47ebc89
32,results22," (D) Pharmacological blockade of sKATP channels with glibenclamide (Glb; 10 μM) did not significantly alter long term potentiation (LTP) formation, although it did produce a slight reduction in the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) amplitude post-theta burst stimulation (TBS). When Glb was bath-applied, long term potentiation (LTP) impairment induced by H2O2 was not fully reversed by ketone application. (E) Bar graph summarizing mean excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) amplitudes (±SEM) at 60 min after theta burst stimulation (TBS) in various treatment groups involving KO mice and WT mice. ANOVA followed by Tukey test; * p < 0.05; ** p <0.01. N.S. = not significant.  An earlier study showed that pharmacological blockade of sKATP channels with glibenclamide (Glb) ameliorated long term potentiation (LTP) formation after high-frequency stimulation [32].",418312ce-f054-4f04-9f9d-afa55ee21e5f
33,results23," We found that Glb has a tendency to slightly reduce long term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices of WT mice, but no differences in excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) amplitude were observed 60 min after theta burst stimulation (TBS) amongst these groups (WT, WT/H2O2/ketones, and WT/H2O2/DZ; Fig. 4D, E). Cotreatment of ketones and H2O2 was unable to fully preserve long term potentiation (LTP) when Glb was bath-applied (Fig. 4D, E), suggesting that the synaptic protection afforded by ketones might partially involve sKATP channels. Additionally, the mitoKATP channel inhibitor, 5HD, completely abolished the partial long term potentiation (LTP) protection induced by either ketones or DZ in Kir6.2 KO mice (Fig. 4C, E). Collectively, these data indicate that both sKATP and mitoKATP channels mediate in part the synaptic protective effects of ketones against oxidative stress. ",467a7df2-030a-4d3f-a08d-fba76526d54b
34,discussion0,"The major finding of the current study is that ketones—at physiologically relevant concentrations—preserve hippocampal synaptic integrity against oxidative stress, likely in part through activation of both sKATP and mitoKATP channels. The protective effects of ketones against an exogenous H2O2 challenge were mirrored by DZ, an activator of sKATP and mitoKATP channels, and genetic ablation of sKATP channels in Kir6.2-/- mice resulted in only partial recovery of hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) by ketones and DZ. While a direct action of ketones on KATP channels could not be demonstrated, similar to earlier studies [19,20,33], our data indicate a key role for both types of ATP-sensitive potassium channels.  It is well known that oxidative stress is a critical factor for the pathogenesis of NDs [34,35]. Oxidative injury induces synaptic impairment, and ultimately cell death, through mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased ATP production, among other actions [3,7,36].",9c053a9a-8647-4b3c-b341-19d024054ca5
35,discussion1," Further, in vitro application of H2O2 results in dose-dependent but site-specific injury (i.e., stratum pyramidale vs. stratum radiatum) [37,38]. Although the reasons behind the differential localization-related effects of oxidative stress remain unclear, a major factor may be the resulting region-specific energy deficits that modulate synaptic plasticity [39]. In this context, we found that hippocampal ATP levels correlated well with both cell viability and synaptic integrity as assessed by an established measure of long term potentiation (LTP). Specifically, the protective effects of ketones may be related to their ability to enhance ATP production, as well as their antioxidant properties as demonstrated earlier [3,40]. Both of these effects help stabilize the resting membrane potential through preserved Na+-K+-ATPase function and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) [41].",bff10c47-1109-41ab-baaf-880a500a1a9c
36,discussion2,"  Importantly, we show in the present study that pharmacological blockade of KATP channels with 5HD results in the elimination of ketone-induced synaptic protection and favorable bioenergetic changes in rat hippocampus. Similarly, we observed that 5HD negated the partial protective effects of both ketones and DZ in Kir6.2 KO mice. Collectively, our data support the notion that ketones, through interactions with both sKATP and mitoKATP channels, promote mitochondrial homeostasis by enhancing ATP generation and antioxidant activity, consistent with previous studies showing that KD treatment—and possibly the resulting ketosis—elevate cellular antioxidant capacity via improvement in mitochondrial redox status [42,43].  Earlier studies have indicated that ketones may exert neuronal inhibitory effects through sKATP channels [19,20], likely by increasing their open probability.",169c3836-103e-466c-a28c-65eb8fad5b62
37,discussion3," However, given our finding that ketones increase ATP levels (both in normal hippocampus as well as that exposed to oxidative stress) and that sKATP channels are known to be inhibited by high ATP/ADP ratios [44], there is an obvious discrepancy that needs to be reconciled. There is abundant evidence in the literature supporting the view that reductions in intracellular ATP/ADP ratios activate sKATP channels, leading to stabilization of the membrane potential, reduced synaptic excitability and enhanced mitochondrial redox status, all of which contribute to resistance against neuronal damage [19,45–48]. Further, it has been hypothesized that there may be compartmental differences in cellular ATP levels, such that the space immediately subjacent to sKATP channels may actually have lower ATP/ADP ratios than elsewhere [19].",58c1a02f-b237-4cca-93b0-a5320b1cb040
38,discussion4," While the underlying basis for this discrepancy remains unclear, it is possible that ketones may directly bind to and activate KATP channels, despite cellular ATP levels remaining in a normal or elevated range [20].  Our findings that ketone application in 10 mM glucose-dissolved physiological saline and culture media containing 5.5 mM glucose conferred neuronal protection and synaptic restoration through KATP channels was somewhat surprising since earlier studies demonstrated that the normal brain glucose detected range of 0.82 to 2.4 mM [49] and the hyperglycemia actually negated the open probability of KATP channels [50]. On the other hand, Lund et al [51] recently reported that neurons cultured in BHB resulted in a strong alleviation of glycolytic intervention, likely by suppressing glucose metabolism seen with ketones [52].",4a005bf2-6fe4-4efb-94f6-df7718414e37
39,discussion5," While there is no direct evidence to elucidate the functional interplay between ATP level and glycolytic activity within ketone application, we cannot exclude the possibility that the decreased ATP supply originating from the glycolysis pathway may be indirectly responsible for enhancing the opening probability of KATP channels. Alternatively, there is compelling data that KATP channels can also be activated by various hormones and neurotransmitters through G-protein coupled interactions, cAMP, and protein kinase A [8,9,53]. In this regard, BHB has been shown as an agonist of the G-protein coupled free fatty acid 3 receptor in rat sympathetic neurons [54].  While KATP channels have been extensively linked to models of NDs and neuroprotective actions, notably as a mechanism for pre-ischemic conditioning [55,56], the functional role of these channels in synaptic neurotransmission remain less clear. However, with respect to cognition, targeted deletion of Kir6.",3c1a2c6f-29a3-4348-8f9f-2093f2567058
40,discussion6,"2 results in age-specific disruption of working memory [31]. In Kir6.2 KO mice aged 5–6 weeks, we found intact long term potentiation (LTP) responses to theta burst stimulation (TBS), but neither ketones nor DZ could rescue long term potentiation (LTP) impairment caused by oxidative stress in these mice. Clearly, the precise relationships between sKATP channels and synaptic plasticity during brain development have yet to be clarified [57].  In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that ketones can protect against oxidative impairment of hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP), likely through activation of both sKATP and mitoKATP channels. These actions subsequently help restore neuronal, synaptic, mitochondrial, and metabolic function.",8da2352c-f7d4-4beb-b75e-a3a7fd940cbe
41,discussion7," Further, our data underscore the therapeutic relevance of KTX-0101 (a highly ketogenic medium chain triglyceride formulation) in the treatment of AD [4], and of DZ in the long-term treatment of 3xTgAD mice which has been shown to improve learning and memory function, and to reduce anxiety [33]. KATP channels represent yet another target mechanism that can potently modulate synaptic function, especially under conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, both of which have been implicated in various NDs.
