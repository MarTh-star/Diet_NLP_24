1,methods0," Patients were recruited from 14 international centers. Participating clinicians completed standardized proformas capturing demographic, clinical, and genetic data. Two pediatric movement disorder experts reviewed available video footage, classifying hyperkinetic movements according to published criteria. ",f54ffaa8-2b69-43d3-9e55-b9b3807a9231
2,results0," Retrospective data analysis was undertaken on 140 patients with complex genetic HMD (Table S1 in Appendix S1). The mean age of HMD onset was 2.8 (range 0–17) years. Mean patient age at last clinical assessment was 13.3 (range 0.5–68) years. Male/female ratio was relatively equal (66:74). A total of 96/140 (68.6%) patients have been previously reported in the literature.  Molecular Genetic Findings  Seventeen different genetic etiologies were identified (Table S1 in Appendix S1). Forty‐two patients had biallelic variants in eight genes, including those causing recessive neurotransmitter defects (DDC, DHPR, PTPS, SLC6A3, SPR, and TH) and PDE10A‐ and MICU1‐related disease. The remaining 98 patients had autosomal dominant variants in nine genes (ADCY5, ATP1A3, FOXG1, GCH1, GNAO1, KMT2B, NKX2.1, SGCE, SLC2A1) that were either inherited or had occurred de novo. Within the cohort, all parents harboring the same ATP1A3, NKX2.1, or SLC2A1 variant as their affected child were also symptomatic.",7f37a65d-4cd1-4f7f-85fc-78d52cf87f48
3,results1," In contrast, incomplete penetrance was observed for ADCY5‐, KMT2B‐, GCH1‐, and SGCE‐related HMDs. Although the majority (126/140) of patients had intragenic variants, microdeletions encompassing the causative gene were identified on aCGH in 14 patients with FOXG1‐, KMT2B‐, NKX2.1‐, and SGCE‐related HMDs.  Variants in a broad range of genes were identified, with key neuronal roles, including regulation of transcription, neuronal differentiation, synaptic transmission, postsynaptic G protein–cAMP signaling, ion flux, dopamine homeostasis, glucose transport, and maintenance of the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (Fig. 1).

The majority of patients (108/140, 77%) had a generalized HMD (Table 1, Fig. 2). Focal or segmental HMD was observed in only 32/140 (23%) patients with SGCE, SLC2A1, ADCY5, and atypical, later‐onset neurotransmitters disorders (GCH1, SLC6A3, DDC, PTPS, and SPR). Patients with focal semiology had significantly later onset of HMD than those with generalized symptoms (4.7 ± 0.7 vs. 2.5 ± 0.3 years, respectively; P = 0.001).  Abnormal Eye Movements  Oculogyric crises were commonly seen in all neurotransmitter defects except autosomal dominant Segawa disease. Eyelid myoclonus and ocular flutter were evident in DTDS(Dopamine Transporter Deficiency Syndrome).",abd73681-e0d9-4fc0-9634-3f3bfb96a816
12,results12," Ptosis (TH and AADC (Aromatic L‐amino acid decarboxylase) deficiency) and oculomotor dyspraxia (TH deficiency) were also observed. Within the wider cohort, strabismus (FOXG1 and ATP1A3) and nystagmus (MICU1) were also reported. Tonic upgaze associated with severe retrocollis was observed in one patient with KMT2B‐dystonia.  Hyperkinetic Facial Movements  Facial hyperkinesia was observed in 80 patients, affecting the upper (n = 31) and/or lower face (n = 66). Forehead wrinkling, excessive blinking, facial grimacing, perioral muscle twitching, lip pursing, jaw opening or clenching, and tongue thrusting, dyskinesia, or impersistence were observed. Facial hyperkinesia was more frequent in children with FOXG1‐, ADCY5‐, NKX2.1‐, and GNAO1‐related HMD, as well as AADC deficiency and DTDS.  Dystonia  Pure dystonia was observed in 25 patients (Fig. 2).",6585866d-eb4a-4e73-8eaa-adb44d58ee36
13,results13," For the remainder, dystonia was always combined with other HMDs, namely, chorea (n = 40), myoclonus (n = 40), tremor (n = 20), and stereotypies (n = 17) (Fig. 2, Table 1). Overall, within the cohort, a number of distinct dystonia phenotypes were evident, including pure dystonia, chorea‐dystonia, myoclonus‐dystonia, and dystonia‐parkinsonism (Video S2).  Dystonia of the lower limbs was observed in 58 ambulant and 27 nonambulant patients. In the nonambulant group, bilateral dystonic postures included fixed/variable leg flexion/extension, striatal toe, toe clawing, and clenched feet. In the ambulant group, patients had gait dystonia with lower‐limb posturing, toe‐walking, striatal toe, toe‐clawing, and gait disturbance. All patients with KMT2B‐HMD had lower‐limb symptoms at disease onset, leading to a purely dystonic gait.",81d08da5-dc56-4b09-a05e-5037c9f9ebc2
14,results14," Lower‐limb dystonia was also observed in 21/61 patients with neurotransmitter defects and in 10/30 SGCE patients, the latter associated with myoclonic jerks in three patients. In the remaining patients, gait dystonia was associated with chorea (ATP1A3, GNAO1, and NKX2.1) and ataxia (ATP1A3, NKX2.1, and SLC2A1).  Upper‐limb dystonia was observed in 98/140 patients, with fixed/variable dystonic posturing of the arms, hand fisting, superimposed coarse dystonic tremor, and action‐induced writer's cramp.  Cervical dystonia was evident in 50 patients (neurotransmitter defects, SGCE, KMT2B, FOXG1, ATP1A3, ADCY5, and SLC2A1).  Chorea  Generalized chorea was observed in 50 patients (Fig. 2). Pure chorea was seen in only five patients with GNAO1‐ and NKX2.1‐related HMD, while in the remainder, chorea was associated with other HMDs (dystonia, n = 36; stereotypies, n = 16; myoclonus, n = 9; ballismus, n = 4; tremor, n = 2; tics, n = 1).",fd8f40d1-5f08-4e2a-8706-1eacdbaf4952
15,results15," Chorea was the predominant HMD in ADCY5‐ (n = 4), ATP1A3‐ (n = 5), FOXG1‐ (n = 16), GNAO1‐ (n = 7), MICU1‐ (n = 2), NKX2.1‐ (n = 8), and PDE10A‐related (n = 2) disease. Chorea was also a prominent HMD in seven children with neurotransmitter defects (DDC, TH, SLC6A3), commonly in tandem with dystonia (n = 5), ballismus (n = 2), myoclonus (n = 1), coarse tremor (n = 3), and stereotypies (n = 1) (Video S3).  Myoclonus  Myoclonus was observed in 45 patients (Fig. 2). Pure myoclonus was observed in only five patients with SGCE‐related HMD, while in the other cases, myoclonus coexisted with dystonia (n = 40), chorea (n = 9), and tremor (n = 1) (Video S4).  Tremor  Tremor was observed in 23 patients, most commonly in those with neurotransmitter diseases, but also in KMT2B‐, MICU1‐, and SLC2A1‐related diseases (Fig. 2). Tremor was observed in combination with dystonia (n = 20), parkinsonism (n = 13), ataxia (n = 3), chorea (n = 2), and myoclonus (n = 2).",f444d9dd-1000-4ec4-942b-655fe4682f68
16,results16," In patients with neurotransmitters defects, a coarse generalized resting tremor was observed in nine infants with parkinsonism‐dystonia (Video S5). Focal neck and upper limb tremor were observed in seven patients with neurotransmitter defects (DHPR, GCH1, PTPS, SLC6A3, and SPR). Prominent head tremor was also identified in one child with Glut1 deficiency and in a patient with KMT2B‐dystonia with retrocollis.  Stereotypies  Fourteen patients with FOXG1‐related HMDs displayed complex motor stereotypies of the upper limbs (repetitive mouthing of hands/objects, midline hand wringing, grasping of clothes), lower limbs (pedalling/pulling), body rocking, bruxism, and nail biting. Three children with GNAO1‐related HMDs also showed self‐injurious stereotypic behavior (lip and nail biting, hair pulling) and repetitive nonpurposeful distal finger movements.",c90e5304-56dc-4c53-8f0d-583247f27645
17,results17,"  Other Neurological and Systemic Features  Developmental delay was evident in 69/140 (49%) patients, being severe in 36 patients with neurotransmitter defects (SLC6A3, TH, DHPR, DDC) and in GNAO1‐, FOXG1‐, and ATP1A3‐related HMDs. Patients with developmental delay had an earlier age of HMD onset than those with normal neurodevelopment (1.5 ± 2.9 vs. 4.7 ± 3.8; P < 0.001). Epileptic seizures were reported in 32/140 (23%) patients and more commonly in those with FOXG1, SLC2A1, GNAO1, ATP1A3, and DHPR variants. Microcephaly was identified in 23/140 (16%) patients with FOXG1, GNAO1, SLC2A1, SGCE, and MICU1 variants and some neurotransmitters disorders (TH, PTPS, DDC, SPR).",efd44037-07f1-4602-9587-f89e14f0bacb
18,results18," Other associated neurological features included psychiatric problems (49/140 patients with anxiety, mood disorders, emotional lability, aggressive behavior, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, panic disorder, specific phobia), hypotonia (37/140), pyramidal signs (17/140), as well as systemic features (46/140 patients, ie, failure to thrive, short stature, dysmorphic features, autonomic dysfunction, gastrointestinal dysfunction, hypothyroidism, respiratory distress) (Table S2 in Appendix S1).  Functional Impairment of HMDs and Impact on DLAs  Ninety‐five of 124 patients (77%) had gait impairment. Forty‐four were either nonambulant or able to walk only supported by another individual or assistive device. Fifty‐one patients were able to walk independently, but their gait was slow and/or frequently associated with balance difficulties and falling.",5aa57de9-efda-4d97-9219-dfa93b238b92
19,results19," Patients with GNAO1, DDC, PDE10A, SLC6A3, and FOXG1 mutations had the highest average scores for gait impairment (2.9, 2.5, 2.5, 2.3, and 2.3, respectively), followed by those with KMT2B and ATP1A3 (1.5), TH and PTPS (1.3), GCH1, MICU1, and NKX2.1 (1), SLC2A1 (0.6), and ADCY5, DHPR, and SPR (0.5) variants. Patients with SGCE mutations had the lowest average gait impairment score (0.36).  Speech impairment was recorded in 73/112 (65%) patients older than 3 years. The most affected groups (>75% of the cases) were those with ATP1A3‐, FOXG1‐, GNAO1‐, KMT2B‐, and PDE10A‐related HMDs and all patients with neurotransmitter defects with the exception of GCH1 deficiency (Table S3 in Appendix S1). Speech difficulties included dysarthria (all HMD genes), language delay (infantile‐onset DDC‐, ATP1A3‐, FOXG1‐, GNAO1‐, PDE10A‐, SLC6A3‐, and TH‐related HMDs), bradylalia (neurotransmitters defects), and dysphonia (KMT2B).",3e876ba6-e35d-49de-954f-1ae0b2f7f86e
20,results20,"  Patients with genetic HMDs also had difficulties with eating/swallowing (n = 54), as well as DLAs requiring fine motor control (n = 67) (Table S3 in Appendix S1).  Paroxysmal Fluctuation  Oculogyric crises, triggered by hunger, illness, and fatigue, were recorded in 25/46 (54%) children with DDC‐, DHPR‐, PTPS‐, SLC6A3‐, SPR‐, and TH‐related HMDs. These children also had periodic dystonic attacks that were often associated with orolingual dyskinesia. Diurnal fluctuation of motor symptoms (associated with sleep benefit) was also described in this group. Gait difficulties, poor balance, and frequent falls triggered by fatigue and prolonged exercise (with partial relief of symptoms after sleep) were seen in five of eight patients with GCH1 defects (Table S4 in Appendix S1).  In ATP1A3 patients, paroxysmal paralysis, dystonia, ataxia, and dysphagia were commonly reported. Identified triggers were extremes of temperature, bathing, emotional stress, or fatigue.",66781ca2-01cd-42ad-a6f7-22c71f000a5d
21,results21," Paroxysmal exacerbation of baseline choreoathetosis was reported in two children with ADCY5 variants, triggered by drowsiness and sleep in one. Episodes of acute ataxia, quadriplegia, and dystonic posturing were described in all four children with Glut1 deficiency after exercise, fatigue, prolonged fasting, and febrile illness. Patients with GNAO1 mutations showed exacerbation of hyperkinetic movements with intercurrent infection, heightened emotion, and purposeful movements. Periods of severe exacerbation were characterized by relentless hyperkinesia, often necessitating admission to the intensive care unit. Dystonic crises were also reported in patients with KMT2B‐related disease (n = 2) and SLC6A3‐related disorders (n = 4), most commonly triggered by intercurrent illness.",de46d376-f478-4db9-98c3-d1b765397ca6
22,results22,"  Treatment and Disease Course  Thirty‐four of 45 patients with neurotransmitters defects showed varying degrees of clinical improvement with dopaminergic agents (levodopa [l‐dopa], dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors). Of the remaining 11 patients, 1 patient with DHPR deficiency developed a pharmacoresistent epileptic encephalopathy with progressive neurological deterioration (despite adequate dopaminergic treatment), and 10 patients with DTDS showed a progressive neurodegenerative disease course with minimal response to drug intervention. Progression of hyperkinetic movements was commonly seen as part of disease evolution in patients with GNAO1 (7/7) and KMT2B (15/17) variants and less frequently in patients with FOXG1‐ (6/17), ATP1A3‐ (2/6), ADCY5‐ (2/4), and SGCE‐related (3/30) disorders. Effective therapies included the ketogenic diet (SLC2A1; n = 4), flunarizine (ATP1A3; n = 4), and tetrabenazine (GNAO1; n = 2).",957008a4-6894-4994-9dc9-4556dc6b7f9e
23,results23," Some patients with HMDs also responded partially or transiently to l‐dopa, benzodiazepines, trihexyphenidyl, carbamazepine, acetazolamide, and topiramate. Deep brain stimulation (Deep brain stimulation (DBS)) of the internal globus pallidus was effective in 13 patients with drug‐resistant SGCE‐, KMT2B‐, and GNAO1‐related HMDs but did not show significant improvement in one 10‐year‐old boy with a severe PDE10A‐related HMD after 2‐year follow‐up (Table 1, Table S2 in Appendix S1).

24,discussion0," Through this multicenter study, we have delineated the genetic landscape of complex HMDs, where diagnostic difficulty is frequently encountered, given the paucity of reliable blood/urine biomarkers, often nonspecific neuroimaging, and broad differential diagnosis. Complex HMD disorders are commonly misdiagnosed, for example, as “dyskinetic” or “dystonic” forms of acquired cerebral palsy. 3 , 4 Accurate clinical diagnosis is essential for prompt instigation of gene‐specific treatments, disease prognostication, and genetic counseling.  Despite the individual rarity of these conditions, we were able to characterize a large cohort of patients with HMDs of broad clinical and genetic heterogeneity. As a result, we provide a comprehensive analysis of motor semiology and associated clinical features in pediatric complex HMDs, together with video recorded material, that will be valuable for both diagnostic and educational purposes.",7d5a6d1d-dcf0-4f75-b4c5-bfcf49ddc912
25,discussion1,"  Our study highlights the increasing diagnostic value of multigene panels and whole‐exome/genome sequencing, which led to a diagnosis in almost one third of the cohort. The identification of several microdeletions encompassing disease‐causing genes (FOXG1, KMT2B, NKX2.1, SGCE) also highlights the diagnostic utility of aCGH for complex HMD. 5 , 6 Variants in a broad range of genes were identified, with different but interconnected cellular functions (Fig. 1). Genes involved in primary neurotransmitter disorders affect dopamine synthesis (DDC, DHPR, PTPS, SPR, and TH) and dopamine transport (SLC6A3). Mutations in GNAO1 and other G protein subunits (G protein subunits (GNAL)), adenylyl cyclase (ADCY5), and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE10A) disrupt the postsynaptic G protein–cAMP pathway axis and may impair neuromodulation or transduction of transmembrane signaling, presynaptic autoinhibitory effects, and altered neuronal excitability.",948b2870-7dcb-4191-b1bb-cd7852903f2d
26,discussion2," Other HMD genes code for neuronal proteins with key biological roles, including Na+/K+‐ATPase transport, osmoregulation, and excitability (ATP1A3), transcriptional repressors involved in the promotion of neurogenesis and cortical neuronal differentiation (FOXG1), transcription factors essential for striatal development (NKX2‐1), dystrophin–glycoprotein complex that links the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (SGCE), regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and synaptic transmission (MICU1), glucose transport (SLC2A1), and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression (KMT2B).  From a clinical perspective, pure HMD phenotypes (defined as those with a single manifesting HMD phenotype) were exceptional in our cohort of patients. We observed a pure dystonic motor semiology in patients with KMT2B‐ and neurotransmitter disorder–related HMDs, leading to gait difficulties in early childhood. 6 , 7 Also, a minority of patients with NKX2‐1 defects showed a pure chorea phenotype.",e019fc26-f9b0-40e2-b4c5-35337d3b5a6e
27,discussion3," In contrast, most patients had a combination of two or more HMDs, or a complex movement disorder with both hyperkinetic and hypokinetic features, commonly known as dystonia‐plus syndromes. In some children with parkinsonism‐dystonia caused by biogenic amine defects, hypokinesia and bradykinesia may be severe and predominate over the HMD phenotype. 3 , 8  Chorea was the second most frequently identified HMD, evident in >50% patients with ADCY5, ATP1A3, FOXG1, NKX2.1, SLC2A1, GNAO1, and PDE10A variants. 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 Chorea was mostly present in combination with dystonia and sometimes myoclonus. Myoclonus was characteristic of SGCE patients, 16 but also observed in ATP1A3 disease, 17 NKX2.1, 13 , 18 FOXG1, 11 GNAO1, 14 KMT2B, 6 SLC2A1, and some neurotransmitters defects, 19 , 20 usually in combination with chorea and dystonia.",64248f22-c894-4e14-bbf7-97253570cdfe
28,discussion4," Myoclonus‐dystonia has also been reported in children with ADCY5 and GCH 21 defects, but this combination was not observed in our cohort of patients. As previously reported, stereotypies were a key disease feature in FOXG1 and GNAO1 patients, always in combination with other HMDs. 11 , 14 Abnormal ocular, facial, and oromandibular movements were also important clues for diagnosis: eyelid myoclonus, ocular flutter, and oculogyric crises were exclusively observed in neurotransmitter diseases. 22 Forehead wrinkling, facial grimacing, perioral muscle twitching, jaw dystonia, and tongue dyskinesias were frequently seen in children with generalized choreodystonia phenotypes because of ADCY5, NKX2.1, GNAO1, and ATP1A3 mutations. 9 , 10 , 12 , 14  In our cohort, the majority had a generalized pattern of HMDs. Only a few patients showed a focal or segmental distribution, predominantly affecting the upper limbs and neck, with significantly later onset of the HMD.",47c6797b-a25b-4d09-a79a-0d926d52cfb7
29,discussion5," Genetic defects presenting in the first year of life were more likely to lead to both a generalized HMD pattern and also developmental delay, as observed in patients with neurotransmitter defects (with the exception of dominant GCH1‐related disease) and those with ATP1A3, FOXG1, GNAO1, SLC2A1, and PDE10A variants. 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 Furthermore, in NKX2.1‐related HMDs, patients had delayed motor development and early hypotonia in infancy. 12 , 18 In addition to developmental delay, many patients in the cohort had other neurological and systemic features. Epilepsy was present in one quarter of our cohort, especially in patients with FOXG1, GNAO1, ATP1A3, and SLC2A1 variants. The co‐occurrence of epilepsy and hyperkinetic phenotypes in genetic syndromes is increasingly recognized. 23 Underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear but may be a consequence of the gene defect, as well as epigenetic phenomena, environmental factors, or the effect of motor evolution in the developing brain.",36f612f5-4f1f-48e4-9976-7ac6533c6df9
30,discussion6," 24  Many complex genetic HMDs are also associated with disease‐specific paroxysmal exacerbations. Oculogyric crises appeared to be exclusive to patients with neurotransmitters defects. 3 , 22 Plegic attacks were identified in patients with ATP1A3 variants and Glut1 deficiency. 13 , 17 More recently, acute hemiplegia has also been reported in patients with ADCY5 variants. 25 Within our series, status dystonicus was seen in patients with GNAO1, KMT2B, and SLC6A3 mutations. 6 , 14 , 26 Some paroxysmal episodes were caused by specific triggers. Exercise‐induced HMDs were seen in Segawa disease 27 and Glut1 deficiency syndrome. 28 Diurnal fluctuation, with improvement after sleep, was recorded in all neurotransmitter defects. 3 , 22 As previously reported, paroxysmal chorea during sleep and on wakening was seen in ADCY5‐related disease.",200d2035-0642-42ed-8b82-e946466af668
31,discussion7," 9 We also identified several other triggers in our cohort, including fever, intercurrent illness, fatigue, emotional stress, temperature, purposeful movements, and fasting.  Complex genetic HMDs also significantly impact on DLAs. More than half of the cohort showed gait and speech impairment, and a significant proportion also showed difficulties in eating, hygiene, and dressing. It is likely that for some conditions (FOXG1, GNAO1), intellectual disability also contributed to functional impairment. 11 , 14 Gait impairment was a common finding in our cohort, with half of the patients (GNAO1, DDC, PDE10A, SLC6A3, and FOXG1 defects) either unable to walk at all or requiring assistance for ambulation. In contrast, a mildly impaired but independent gait pattern was commonly observed in patients with drug‐responsive neurotransmitters defects (GCH1, DHPR, SPR, TH, and PTPS), nonprogressive chorea (NKX2.1, ADCY5), Glut1 syndrome (SLC2A1), and myoclonus‐dystonia (SGCE).",a6c0520e-1f72-4f6e-8b31-5f7c4196ad68
32,discussion8,"  Standard investigations, including blood/urine tests and neuroimaging, are unyielding for the genetic defects included in our study. Rarely, subtle neuroimaging patterns can be present, including corpus callosum abnormalities and brain atrophy in GNAO1 and FOXG1 defects, 11 , 29 and subtle T2 low signal intensity within the globus pallidus in KMT2B‐dystonia. 6 Interestingly, patients with heterozygous mutations in PDE10A show bilateral striatal necrosis, while those included in our study with biallelic variants have normal structural magnetic resonance imaging despite having low levels of PDE10A protein in the striatum. 15 Our study highlights the merit of undertaking cerebrospinal fluid glucose and neurotransmitters, particularly to aid diagnosis of Glut1 deficiency and neurotransmitter defects (Fig. 2).",848e68f9-2a89-41a7-8fcf-4b2b71181663
33,discussion9," In patients with suspected disorders of monoamine metabolism, urine sepiapterin or blood prolactin levels can also be measured; however, they are neither universally available nor sensitive/specific for diagnostic purposes. Although not disease specific, hypothyroidism was evident in NKX2.1 disease 12 and increased creatine kinase levels in patients with MICU1 defects. 30  Genetic characterization of patients with complex HMDs may facilitate selection of appropriate therapies. Many patients with neurotransmitter defects in our series showed a significant and sustained improvement with dopaminergic agents. 22 However, our study confirms that both AADC deficiency and DTDS remain challenging, where novel treatment strategies, such as gene therapy, may have a role. 31 Ketogenic diet improved motor performance and paroxysmal episodes in four of five patients with Glut1 deficiency.",795183bf-1a3d-4e53-9ec9-895040787680
34,discussion10," 28 More recently, triheptanoin has been shown to dramatically reduce paroxysmal motor disorders and epileptic discharges in patients with Glut1 deficiency in open‐label pilot studies, 32 but these results were not confirmed in a randomized, blinded, placebo‐controlled clinical trial, suggesting that triheptanoin is of limited therapeutic use. 33  Recently, the Rare Movement Disorders Study Group of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society designed an online survey to identify worldwide barriers for the genetic diagnosis of movement disorders. They found limited access to genetic testing in all countries compared with Europe and North America. Given these findings, it is important to emphasize that patients with early‐onset dystonia of unknown etiology should receive a trial with l‐dopa to exclude a possible defect in dopamine metabolism, regardless of the availability of genetic testing.",c9c5d978-6bf2-49ec-966d-c8d73307afb2
35,discussion11," 34  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) remains important for patients with medically intractable dystonia, and the contribution of genetic testing to outcome from Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is increasingly recognized. 35 In our cohort, Deep brain stimulation (DBS) was effective for 13 patients with KMT2B‐, SGCE‐, and GNAO1‐related disease. 6 , 36 , 37 Deep brain stimulation (DBS) reduced the risk for life‐threatening hyperkinetic exacerbations in GNAO1 patients. Marked improvement of choreoathetosis (albeit with only mild functional recovery) has also been reported in ADCY5 disease after Deep brain stimulation (DBS). 9  Although we studied a broad patient population from multiple centers, there are a number of study limitations. The lack of standardization of video footage may have affected HMD classification, although researchers were stringent in analyzing only videos where the whole body could be assessed.",1dc2790c-34b8-43ee-9109-caf2a491fc78
36,discussion12," Furthermore, our strict inclusion criteria excluded a number of genetic HMDs, including those with isolated motor semiology (eg, DYT1 dystonia), as well as some metabolic diseases, and disorders where the HMD is a less prominent part of the clinical phenotype (eg, epileptic encephalopathies). This may have led to an overall ascertainment bias when considering complex genetic HMDs, although our deliberate aim was to focus on better delineating complex HMD disorders where the HMD was the main phenotype without highly predictive blood, urine, or radiological biomarkers. Finally, it is important to emphasize that the motor features identified in our cohort are derived from a very small subset of individuals with each genetic defect; therefore, the spectrum of movement disorders analyzed in this study does not fully represent the breath of HMDs that may be associated with a particular gene.",9f4f4e97-f1ac-4291-ac31-af9f1f02332d
37,discussion13,"  In conclusion, detailed clinical assessment and careful classification of the HMD semiology is key to diagnosing complex genetic HMDs. If neuroimaging, blood, and urine neurometabolic testing are unyielding, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and targeted neurogenetic investigations should be promptly undertaken. In the future, better understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms will no doubt facilitate the development of precision treatment strategies for these disorders.
