0,background0,"Despite advances in understanding the basic neurobiology of spinal cord injury (spinal cord injury (SCI)), the development of therapeutic strategies for the acutely injured spinal cord has been agonizingly slow. Thus, spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a significant cause of disability and mortality. spinal cord injury (SCI) in humans not only leads to the well-recognized loss of motor and sensory function, but also the less-studied multiple secondary complications (i.e., bladder and bowel dysfunction, metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease) caused by extreme physical inactivity due to paralysis [1–3]. These secondary complications of spinal cord injury (SCI) contribute to the greatly reduced lifespan of these patients, which is rarely emphasized.",8309ca32-d69c-4c51-88da-3f128a4ae650
1,background1," While the field has made large strides in improving the survival of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the acute 2-year phase after injury (40% reduction in mortality), there have been no gains in lifespan in the chronic situation over the last 20 years [4]. Furthermore, individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) who survive beyond the first 2 years after injury still die on average 13–25 years earlier than able-bodied people, depending on the level and severity of injury [4–6]. The current paradigm holds that better neurological recovery during the acute period will lead to a longer, more active and independent life for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). In addition, individuals with improved neurological recovery are expected to better manage problems such as spasticity, weight gain and chronic pain, and to be less likely to experience feelings of anxiety, loneliness and depression.",9b9c69ce-0856-4854-85fd-ccd62477d872
2,background2,"  After the initial trauma of spinal cord injury (SCI), cell death and tissue loss continue for several weeks [7], a window in which one could effectively intervene with neuroprotective strategies. During this time, an escalating cycle of glutamate excitotoxicity, inflammation and neuronal apoptosis leads to progressive degeneration in the spinal cord [8]. Currently, the only approach taken to restrict secondary damage after spinal cord injury (SCI) is surgical decompression and the administration of methylprednisolone. However, the recommendations to use methylprednisolone have fluctuated from “standard of care” to “optional” to “not recommended” and currently back to “optional” in the US and Canada since it has been shown to offer merely marginal benefit in select patient groups and increase the risk of major complications—in particular, gastrointestinal ulcers/bleeding during the acute stage of spinal cord injury (SCI) [7].",e67d3150-ad60-44cd-adec-c86bfd5eabc6
3,background3," In addition, several trials of neuroprotective treatments given in the acute phase after spinal cord injury (SCI) have failed [9], while other approaches such as therapeutic hypothermia and administration of drugs targeting inflammation or glutamate excitotoxicity, for example, are still under investigation [8] and are not standard of care. This situation highlights the urgent need for new approaches for preventing secondary damage during the acute phase of spinal cord injury (SCI).  Emerging evidence suggests that acute-phase hyperglycemia is a critical indicator of poor functional outcomes of spinal cord injury (SCI) [10, 11]. The presence of hyperglycemia (≥126 mg/dl) on hospital admission (irrespective of past diabetes mellitus history) was found to be strongly associated with a lower probability of improvement in motor and sensory functions. Changes to diet might be the least invasive approach to recovery after neurotrauma.",e9986807-7a24-4c06-bc68-4e1ae93621c1
4,background4," A wide variety of evidence suggests that the ketogenic diet (KD) could have beneficial disease-modifying effects in a broad range of neurological disorders [12–16]. The KD is composed of 80–90% fat, with carbohydrate and protein constituting the remainder of the intake. Energy is largely derived from the utilization of dietary fat. These fats are converted in the liver to ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone, which provide the brain with an alternative energy source to glucose. The ability of a KD to ameliorate the diabetic state and help stabilize hyperglycemia has been repeatedly shown in human studies [17, 18]. In addition, a study by Streijger et al. showed the critical role of ketones in neuroprotection by starting a KD 4 h after cervical hemi-contusion in rats with spinal cord injury (SCI) [19].",9b0abc5f-87e3-41ef-b864-963f73f18c37
5,background5," Consistent with the published effects of a KD in rat models of spinal cord injury (SCI) and in humans with hyperglycemia, our randomized pilot feasibility trial [20] showed that, compared with a standard hospital diet (SD), 5 weeks of KD improved upper extremity motor scores (Fig. 1).

(b) Association impairment scale (AIS) light touch (LT) and pin-prick (PP) sensory scores    Although the exact mechanism by which the KD provides neuroprotection is not fully understood, three main effects on cellular energetics, mitochondria function and inflammation have been suggested to play a key role [21, 22].",b39d4c79-a128-4399-beb0-fc425050e29d
6,background6," Consequently, a KD may be optimal for maintaining a normal glycemic state, promoting inflammation regulation and rescuing mitochondrial function after spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, in this clinical trial, our purposes are to: i) show safety and feasibility to administer a KD in the acute stages of spinal cord injury (SCI); ii) determine if 5 weeks of KD versus SD significantly improves motor and sensory function, functional independence, glycemic control, and microbiome composition in patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI); and iii) quantify serum biomarkers that are linked to improvements in neurological recovery and functional independence via targeted proteomics.",6f0ad0db-89ed-4649-8ace-db0683ce87d6

All of these differences are approximately at the same levels as those that Kramer et al. detected as being statistically significant and clinically meaningful [36]. We believe that these estimates are conservative since we are performing our primary statistical analyses for between-group and within-group comparisons simultaneously using statistical methods that are more sophisticated than those that are assumed here.",9b7157aa-10b1-4174-91c8-458fd12cddea
35,background35," Given our history in spinal cord injury (SCI) patient recruitment and the large spinal cord injury (SCI) patient base at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Spain Rehabilitation Center (SRC), we fully expect to meet our recruitment goal.  Randomization and blinding Randomization is performed using the block randomization method, with a block size of four (study statistician). A randomization list is generated, and the random assignments placed into closed envelopes. Each study participant opens one of these envelopes to learn of their group assignment. Study patients will inevitably know their group assignment as we are limited by the difficulties of inadequate masking of the ketogenic diet, which is very restrictive and requires avoidance of usual foods like bread, pasta, rice, potatoes and a wide variety of fruits.",4b40983b-451a-4d4d-b8c9-d2b038d7933f
36,background36," In order to avoid a potential placebo effect or a participant biasing results due to knowledge of their diet, during the consenting process we simply explain that the study is designed to examine the impact of KD and SD on outcomes. In addition, individuals performing clinical and laboratory tests and the study statistician were blinded to the study interventions.  Data management To protect privacy, each study participant is assigned a unique four-digit identification number that cannot be traced to any protected health information (protected health information (PHI)).

All study data are managed in a central database using REDCap, a secure web-based software system designed for clinical trials which meets both HIPAA and 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. All questionnaires and daily surveys are coded into REDCap and administered electronically. Data from serum assays, resting energy expenditure (REE) measurements, and sensory measures via dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials and EPTs are output from the respective technical equipment in electronic form and then uploaded directly into the REDCap database.",b39830c5-9ec6-4ad6-a257-76fe86268215

40,analysis0,"Statistical analyses for neurological recovery will include comparisons of means of motor and sensory function, functional independence and serum measurements (e.g., glucose, insulin, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase) between the two groups, as well as comparisons within each group of the changes from baseline to rehabilitation to discharge (which should take approximately 5 weeks). Descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency (sample mean, sample median) and dispersion (variance) will be calculated for each group. For safety outcomes, instead of comparing the two groups to the established standard safety values, we will compare circulating levels of proposed outcomes at the various time points among the two groups. If there are no significant group differences in these outcomes, we will conclude that the KD intervention is safe.",035c1a9a-efba-4767-a566-cc2e08f3542d
41,analysis1," We will also calculate 95% confidence intervals for the mean group differences for these outcomes as an additional check on safety and feasibility. The primary method of analysis will be analysis of covariance (analysis will be analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)), regressing the 5-week outcomes (safety, motor and sensory recovery, functional independence, and glycemic state) on the randomly assigned diet, baseline values of the measures, and other covariates such as age and sex. Repeated measures analysis will be analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will also be used. Statistical assumptions will be assessed using box plots, residual plots and normal probability plots. Secondary analyses, accounting for all time points, will be conducted using mixed linear models, including repeated measures models. An appropriate structure for the covariance matrix (e.g., the unstructured covariance matrix) will be selected for these models using the final data.",8ab6aba8-0c47-4eca-bb21-c784e1220e98
42,analysis2," When a model term is statistically significant, the Tukey–Kramer multiple comparisons test will be used to determine which specific pair of means are significantly different. This method will allow us to compare changes over time (within-group changes) and differences between groups simultaneously. Covariates (e.g., length of enteral and solid feeding and length of stay in acute and rehabilitation care) will be accounted for in these analyses. Overall cross-sectional between-group comparisons, such as baseline comparisons used to examine pretest parameters, may be performed using the two-group t test, and overall within-group comparisons may be performed using the paired t test. If assumptions of normality of distribution for the above tests are not tenable, variables may be transformed prior to analysis, or appropriate nonparametric tests, such as the Wilcoxon rank-sum and signed-rank tests, may be used.",bc529d74-d1ec-4cd4-98ce-13792ce11d73
43,analysis3," Statistical tests will be two-sided and will be performed using a 5% significance level. Stratified analyses accounting for different injury levels will also be performed. These analyses will be specific to the distribution of data in each individual subgroup, which will minimize heterogeneity and allow us to analyze subgroups that may be more statistically homogenous and clinically relevant. SAS software, version 9.4 or later, will be used to conduct the statistical analyses. Multiple imputation methods will be used to address missing data for variables with moderate amounts of missing data (≥10%) and after examining whether data are missing completely at random, missing at random, or missing not at random. Missing data analysis will not be performed on variables with <10% missing data to avoid statistical bias larger than that obtained through the use of complete case analysis.",3c079fab-4b60-483c-9ba4-43f0cd31af3b
44,analysis4,"  For microbiome analysis, alpha diversity indices will be analyzed using linear mixed-model with time (pre- and post-) and group (KD and SD) as fixed factors and participant as a random effect. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance testing will be used to assess the effects of time, treatment, and time × treatment on beta diversity indices. The principal coordinate analysis will be performed to visualize the beta diversity distance matrices [18].  For targeted proteomics, three specific analytic approaches will be utilized. First, two-sample t tests, or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests if the normality assumption is questionable, will be used to examine differences in the number of selected peptides and proteins between diet groups at discharge (approximately 5 weeks). Because of the number of proteins to be examined, a false discovery rate of 0.2 will be used to account for multiple hypothesis tests.",76597728-b6c6-4025-b8e6-e4e89b4ca7c4
45,analysis5," The second approach will examine the manner in which levels of selected peptides vary across the longitudinal time points of baseline, rehabilitation and discharge. To examine these patterns, mixed linear models such as repeated measures models using time as a within-person factor and diet as a between-person factor will be constructed. Finally, Pearson’s correlation will be used to measure the strength and direction of linear associations between selected peptide levels and 5-week outcomes of safety, neurological, functional and glycemic status.   Trial monitoring No regular external trial auditing is scheduled. However, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)) includes two external safety monitors and three study personnel including the PI, study physician and a postdoctoral fellow.",e67782a1-ede7-41d6-a9f6-b3ada1b768f6

57,discussion0,"Despite extensive research, no pharmacologic therapy has demonstrated significant improvement on the neurological or functional recovery in people with spinal cord injury (SCI), and the need for innovative therapies remains urgent. The scientific premise of this project rests on accumulating evidence that diet-based therapies, such as the KD, offer effective neuroprotection against secondary injury cascades and improve forelimb motor function in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI) and improve upper extremity motor function in patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI). The KD is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet designed to mimic the metabolic and biochemical changes that occur during calorie restriction, specifically ketosis. Ketone bodies have been shown to exert neuroprotective effects by preventing oxidative damage, attenuating neuroinflammation and glutamate excitotoxicity and inhibiting apoptosis in the brain and spinal cord.",996ccf50-1311-417a-aaf8-4d8b3969097a
58,discussion1," Because glutamate excitotoxicity, inflammation and induction of apoptotic pathways lead to progressive degeneration in the spinal cord shortly after the injury, inhibition of these processes by ketone bodies may enhance neurological recovery after an spinal cord injury (SCI). In support of these hypotheses, we recently showed for the first time that, compared with an SD, 5 weeks of a KD improved upper extremity motor function in patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) (Fig. 1) [20]. In addition, a neuroinflammatory blood protein, fibrinogen, was present at lower levels in the KD serum samples than in the SD serum samples. Taken together, our preliminary results suggest that a KD may induce anti-inflammatory effects in part by reducing fibrinogen, which promotes neuroprotection and improved recovery.",ea057751-e504-41fd-ac93-4ff61dc5695a
59,discussion2,"  On the basis of these preliminary data in patients, we have designed a randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of a novel nutritional intervention, the KD, on improving sensory and motor recovery, functional independence and glycemic control in patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) and on the molecular mechanisms thereof. Our findings may lead to a safe, effective, simple and economical intervention that improves health outcomes for these patients. Changing patients to a more neuroprotective diet during acute care of spinal cord injury (SCI) can be implemented anywhere in the world at low cost and without major regulatory hurdles. Better functional recovery will lead to a better quality of life and long-term health outcomes in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, the risks incurred by participants in the study are minor relative to the benefit of improving the quality of life of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).",394428c0-d33a-4b78-87ac-8516aa171bad
