The patients were recruited according to the following inclusion criteria. First, the patients should meet the diagnostic criteria of Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) following the International Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) Consortium in 2012 and 2018 (23, 24); that is, patients having a pathogenic variant in Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 or Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)2.",61847ed6-44be-4081-a05f-a4e295c126d3
2,methods2," For patients not having genetic test reports, clinical criteria (the presence of two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria) of Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) should be met. Second, the patients should be diagnosed with drug-resistant epilepsy, i.e., failure to achieve sustained seizure freedom after adequate trials of two tolerated, appropriately chosen anti-seizure medications (ASMs) schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) (25). Patients diagnosed with drug-resistant epilepsy may have failed to respond to epilepsy surgery or did not receive surgery evaluation before KD. Besides, Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients with West syndrome or infantile spasms who failed to respond to adrenocorticotropic hormone and another ASM were also recruited. Third, two patients still having an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) discharge or global development delay after administration of two or more kinds of ASM schedules were also included.",7a5c931d-260a-47eb-9586-8c06d9bd1c26

The intelligence quotient (IQ) and developmental quotient (DQ) tests were not commonly conducted, only 14 patients had the tests before KD, and four had the tests after KD. Development delay was diagnosed mainly based on a thorough clinical history and a detailed physical examination by a trained specialist. The 51 patients were diagnosed with psychomotor development delay at KD initiation, and three of them were diagnosed with ASD. At last, the patients were 0.4–14 years of age and had a KD treatment and follow-up time of ≥1 month. To avoid the influence of possible late response, we used the efficacy at 3 months after KD to the analysis of the KD's effect on reducing seizures and improving cognition and behavior.",b289e4ad-946f-4672-b2d1-58b93b148aed

Study Design  Implementation of KD  The patients initiated KD as inpatients. 50 patients initiated the classic KD, of whom 30 patients initiated KD with a ketogenic ratio (the ratio of fat to carbohydrate and protein) of 2:1, 15 with 4:1, 4 with 3:1, and 1 with 2.5:1. While the other 3 patients were treated with a modified Atkins diet (modified Atkins diet (MAD)), of which the lipid-to-nonlipid ratio was not strict, ranging from 1:1 to 1.5:1, but carbohydrates were kept at 10–20 g/day.

Before KD initiation, the dietitians designed the KD meal plans based on the patients' food habits and body weights. During the KD treatment, other diets were stopped, and the original ASMs did not change within 3 months after KD initiation. Meanwhile, potassium citrate, multi-vitamins, essential minerals, and calcic agent without sucrose and lactose were supplemented in the daily diet. For the first week of KD, all patients were inpatients and were closely monitored for any possible adverse effect, and their parents or caregivers were trained on how to calculate the dietary ratio and make ketogenic foods at home. After discharge, the patients were asked to make daily records of seizures, calories, KD foods, and side effects. At 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after KD, the patients revisited the hospitals.",f4f88c4f-a17b-48ad-9988-6c0c20430404
6,methods6," After 6 months of KD, the revisit interval was extended to half a year if the KD was effective. In addition, the dietitians followed up with the patients by telephone or WeChat monthly. In any emergency, patients could go to the nearest hospital or contact doctors and dietitians in the KD group.  Data Collection  A unified information collection form was developed to collect data on clinical manifestations, cognitive and behavioral status, ASMs, and seizure frequency before and after KD. Information on the age of KD initiation, dietary ketogenic ratio, duration, efficacy, and adverse effects of KD therapy was also collected via this form. The seizure types were classified following the 2017 International League against Epilepsy classification criteria (26). At KD initiation, the parents or caregivers received specialized training from neurologists on identifying the seizure type and frequency and assessing psychomotor developmental issues during the hospital stay.",c12ffe73-4146-4b88-b8ff-b4d8e296d6e6

Information of cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) was also collected.  KD Efficacy Analysis  KD efficacy was evaluated in terms of seizure reduction and psychomotor development. For assessment of seizure reduction, baseline (Pre-KD) seizure frequency was recorded by parents or guardians 1 month before initiation of KD, defined as the total seizure frequency during the 1 month before the initiation of KD. Patients with ≥50% reduction in total seizures during a particular month after KD were defined as responders to KD. Seizure freedom after KD was defined as the absence of seizures for at least one month. As the developmental test is relatively scarce, only 14 patients underwent the test before KD, while 4 had the test after KD.",88326908-cd4e-4f37-a063-55a7b802f69b
8,methods8," The psychomotor improvement was assessed based on pediatric neurologists' examination and caregiver' evaluation at 3 months after KD. For development evaluation by family members, the evaluation was made based on language expression, instruction execution, and learning ability. There were three levels of cognitive and behavioral improvement: Grade I for obvious improvement, Grade II for no obvious change, and Grade III for regression in cognition and behavior. Patients with obvious improvement (Grade I) were defined as responders to KD.  KD Safety Analysis  Blood and urine routine examination, liver and kidney function, blood electrolytes, blood lipids, gallbladder, and urinary system color ultrasound examinations were conducted at baseline, and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after KD. In addition, any adverse clinical events presumed to be related to KD were recorded.",b7ef5c40-f669-4800-9920-4fededceb03b

The Chi-square test was used to analyze the effects of sex and cortical tubers on the efficacy of KD. Fisher's exact probability method was used to analyze the effects of seizure type, genotype, and dietary ketogenic ratio on the efficacy of KD. The nonparametric test was used to analyze the effects of the age at epilepsy onset, the age at KD initiation, or the duration of epilepsy before KD. Paired t-test was used to analyze the change of ASMs pre and after KD.

16,discussion0," In our study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of KD in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy and cognitive impairment related to Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in children. The overall response rates in terms of seizure reduction at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after KD were 51.0, 45.1, 47.1, 43.1, and 25.5%, respectively. In addition, 36 of the 51 patients (70.6%) with psychomotor retardation exhibited obvious improvement of cognitive function after KD therapy.  The efficacy of KD for Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated epilepsy has previously been evaluated in single-center or smaller sample-size studies. For example, Kossoff et al., (5) first reported that at 6 months after starting KD, 11 of 12 children with Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (92%) experienced >50% reduction of seizures. Park et al.",b8023548-5c06-4cd1-be4d-0f0b7bcc2a6c
17,discussion1," (27) analyzed 12 children with drug-resistant epilepsy related to Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) who received KD therapy and found that at 3 months of KD treatment, 10 patients (83.3%) had a >50% reduction of seizures. Youn et al. (28) also studied the long-term efficacy of KD for drug-resistant epilepsy in patients with Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and found that at 3 months of KD, 21 of 31 patients (67.7%) had >50% reduction of seizures. All these studies suggest that KD may be effective in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy associated with Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC); however, more studies on the application of KD in this rare disease group are needed.  The findings of cognitive improvement in this multicenter study are similar to the results of a single-center study by Park et al. (27), which showed that in 12 patients with Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-related epilepsy, four patients (33.3%) were “much improved” and five patients (41.",ecadac88-6a49-48bc-8f3c-43b9fa7eba80
18,discussion2,"7%) were “somewhat improved” after 3 months of KD. In particular, there are three patients (3/51, 5.9%) diagnosed with ASD before KD, were reported with an obvious improvement in behavior, after receiving KD therapy for a mean duration of 20.2 (17.37 to 26) weeks. Therefore, KD might be an effective therapy for cognitive impairment and ASD in Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).  During KD therapy, KBs replace glucose to be the main brain fuel. This process benefits the potassium channel, which is sensitive to adenosine triphosphate, adenosine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) energy activity; increases the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor; expands energy reserves; and improves mitochondrial function, ensuring stabilization of neuron action potential (21, 29). Ketone substrates also improve the structural and functional synaptic plasticity and lead to the activation of the signaling pathway that reinforces neural bioenergy and resistance to oxidative stress (30, 31).",2af581d3-97de-484f-a74d-36e41f296e8f
19,discussion3," The benefits of cognition can be translated into improvements in verbal and recognition memory, verbal fluency, executive function, and global cognition (21, 32, 33). Nevertheless, further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which KD improves cognition and behavior function of patients with developmental delay and ASD.  Although patients with psychomotor improvement did not reduce ASMs at 6 and 12 months after KD (P = 0.161 and P = 0.455, respectively), some patients with seizure freedom did have a reduction in the burden of ASMs. In our study, 18 patients (18/51, 35.3%) experienced seizure freedom, and four of the 18 patients (4/51, 7.8%) tried to reduce the use of ASMs; among them, three patients (3/51, 5.9%) still maintained seizure freedom, but one patient (1/51, 2.0%) experienced seizure recurrence. In addition, one patient treated with KD who experienced >90% reduction of seizures maintained the state of >90% reduction of seizures after reducing ASMs.",0fbd18aa-0dc8-4386-bfc5-5393cb2782e0
20,discussion4," Therefore, KD is beneficial in some children with drug-resistant epilepsy related to Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), when the use of ASMs is reduced, which is similar to the conclusion of Youn et al. (28). When KD treatment fails, surgery may be an alternative option, and one patient in our study chose surgery after KD failure.  Consistent with the report by Youn et al. (28), our study showed that there was no direct correlation between KD efficacy and seizure type at KD initiation, Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) gene mutation, or the interval from seizure onset to KD initiation. Meanwhile, the efficacy of KD in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy associated with Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) was not affected by the age of epilepsy onset, age at KD initiation, sex, cortical tubers, or the ketogenic ratio. However, Youn et al.",0ba4dc78-a4f6-43bc-ab47-d2719d7ecb8f
21,discussion5," (28) found that the ages at seizure onset and KD initiation were significantly earlier in patients who experienced a recurrence of seizures after reaching seizure freedom than in patients with sustained seizure freedom (P = 0.005 and P = 0.005, respectively). Furthermore, patients who experienced a recurrence of seizures after seizure freedom were treated with significantly more ASMs than patients with sustained seizure freedom (P = 0.009).  Another issue is the relationship between the ketogenic ratio and KD efficacy. In our study, there was no significant difference in KD efficacy either among groups of different ketogenic ratios at KD initiation (P = 0.133) or among groups of different ketogenic ratios during the maintenance period (P= 0.493). However, a previous report by Seo et al. (34) showed that the 4:1 KD had greater antiepileptic efficacy than the 3:1 KD (P < 0.05) at 3 months after initiating the diet. Bough et al.",bfbabbdb-7ec0-42bf-b7a2-abd3ae78ef27
22,discussion6," (35) also found that the seizure threshold was significantly elevated with increased ketogenic ratios in rats. The discrepancies between our study and the above studies may be due to the following reasons. First, the sample size in each ketogenic ratio group was too small. Second, the lack of association of ketogenic ratio at KD initiation with the efficacy in the first month after KD may be because the time was too short for patients to show response. Third, the lack of effect of ketogenic ratio in the maintenance period on the KD efficacy in the third month after KD maybe because most (26/37, 70.3%) patients using the classical KD had adjusted the ketogenic ratio (1.5–4:1) during the maintenance period, while a few (11/37, 29.7%) patients used a fixed ratio (4:1 or 3:1 or 2:1) during the maintenance period.",80883c31-76b6-4dae-924e-7d4b4f918958
23,discussion7,"  The mTOR signaling pathway plays a crucial role in brain development, and the Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-related neuropsychological abnormalities are related to the over-activation of the mTOR signaling pathway (10, 36). McDaniel et al. have confirmed that KD could inhibit the over-activation of the mTOR signaling pathway in animal models (37). In addition, Warren et al. (20) confirmed that decanoic acid, a vital component of the medium-chain triglyceride KD, could decrease the mTORC1 activity in rat hippocampus ex vivo and Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patient-derived astrocytes. These results provide a biological mechanism of KD efficacy in Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). However, in the case series of five Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients, KD did not induce tumor regression or suppress the growth of Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-related tumors (38). KD did not appear to be able to provide the same level of mTOR inhibition required to cause tumor regression.",d23ca8a4-7bf2-4304-897e-44e3f0840059
24,discussion8," The exact mechanism of KD-mediated improvement of seizures and cognitive behavior in Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients is still not fully understood and needs further study.  There are several limitations to our study. First, this was a retrospective study, so the data was not complete enough. In our study, for the lack of IQ and DQ tests, the evaluation of psychomotor improvement was mainly based on subjective assessment by neurologists and parents. Future studies are needed to compare psychomotor states before and after KD by some objective assessment such as formal IQ and DQ tests, and formal questionnaires of assessment of life quality or even childhood autism rating scale in Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with ASD. Second, since the follow-up time of this study was 12 months, we mainly analyzed the short-term efficacy of KD in the treatment of Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). More studies are needed to explore the long-term outcomes of KD in the future.",533b5c33-2d06-4c4b-a545-a34881cb4b5f
25,discussion9," Third, we did not analyze the relationship between KBs and KD efficacy, although KBs were regularly monitored in children on KD. Fourth, due to the limited medical resources, we did not perform enough EEG recording during the KD. The cycle of EEG reexamination in children with epilepsy is usually 6 to 12 months, so it is difficult to perform follow-up EEG every 1 to 2 months after KD initiation in clinical practice. Therefore, we should continue collecting the relevant data to further explore the long-term outcomes in the future.  Conclusions  KD is an effective and safe treatment for children with Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-related drug-resistant epilepsy and cognitive impairment. KD can reduce seizure frequency and may potentially improve cognition and behavior.
