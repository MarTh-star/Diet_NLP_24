0,introduction0,"Approximately one third of adult epilepsy patients do not achieve seizure freedom with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) [1, 2]. Those who have failed on two AEDs have been found to have a < 5% chance of achieving seizure freedom with a further AED trial [3]. These patients with drug-resistant epilepsy carry a significant disease burden [4, 5]. In addition, many are either not amenable to or decline surgical intervention [6], further underpinning the need for effective, alternative treatment options.  Ketogenic diet therapy, characterised by a high fat and low carbohydrate diet, is widely used for drug-resistant epilepsy in children, for whom there is a strong evidence base for efficacy [7, 8]. Whilst the ‘classic’ ketogenic diet involves a strict 3:1–4:1 ratio of fats to combined carbohydrate and protein, a number of variations have been developed in an attempt to improve tolerability and reduce adverse effects.",820709e0-852d-405e-b8bf-6bc628741ce2
1,introduction1," These include the modified Atkins diet (modified Atkins diet (MAD)), low glycaemic index treatment, and the modified ketogenic diet (modified ketogenic diet (MKD)). Carbohydrate restriction is similar between the modified Atkins diet (MAD) and modified ketogenic diet (MKD), however, in the modified ketogenic diet (MKD), there is a target amount of fat (approximately 80% of calories) to ensure daily calorie intake is controlled. The mechanism behind the putative antiepileptic effects of dietary manipulation remains unclear (for a review, see [9]).  Feasibility studies have endorsed the use of ketogenic diets in adults [10], however, access to appropriate services within the UK remains limited. There is an increased demand for such services [11], and more centres worldwide are prescribing ketogenic diets than before [12]. A recent meta-analysis showed that 53% of patients with intractable epilepsy can achieve a reduction in seizure frequency of > 50% with a ketogenic diet [13].",e8899a82-c1a4-436d-a6e8-b4c6319c6b83
2,introduction2," However, its effectiveness is limited by the availability of suitably trained dietitians [14], poor compliance [15], lack of efficacy in certain circumstances [16], and side effects [16]. Despite the success of ketogenic diets in a controlled environment [7], establishing a ketogenic diet service for adults with favourable ‘real-life’ effectiveness, retention and safety remains a significant challenge [17].  We present outcomes of the first 100 referrals to a dedicated ketogenic diet service for adults with drug-resistant epilepsy at the largest epilepsy centre in the UK. We investigated the real-life feasibility of this service and describe observational data on the effectiveness, retention rate and safety profile of the modified ketogenic diet (MKD).

The follow-up period was 12 months. Data were collected from regular (between twice per week and once per fortnight) telephone consultations with a dietitian, and baseline and follow-up appointments every 3 months with a clinician. Data were collected on the following: number initiating treatment, reasons for not initiating treatment, length of adherence, reasons for discontinuation, side effects, number of previous AEDs, number of current AEDs, seizure types and epilepsy syndrome, coexistent and previous epilepsy treatments (e.g. vagus nerve stimulation or epilepsy surgery), and seizure frequency.

Training on blood ketone and glucose testing was also provided. If patients did not attend their first appointment, they were offered two further opportunities.  Diet prescriptions Patients’ estimated energy requirements and macronutrient targets were calculated according to baseline anthropometric data. modified ketogenic diet (MKD) was prescribed to provide a minimum of 80% of total calories from fat.

General advice was provided to help improve tolerance and maintain compliance. Upon completion of the initial 12 weeks on modified ketogenic diet (MKD), patients were seen every 3 months by a clinician and dietitian to review their progress and determine if continuation on modified ketogenic diet (MKD) was appropriate.

21,discussion0,"This single-centre prospective study investigated the effectiveness, retention and safety profile of a modified ketogenic diet in adults with epilepsy. Overall, modified ketogenic diet (MKD) showed good effectiveness, improving seizure frequency in 60% of patients, with 38% experiencing > 50% reduction in seizure frequency and 13% experiencing a period of seizure freedom. However, 30% described worsening of seizure frequency during the study period and 67% had discontinued modified ketogenic diet (MKD) by 12 months. This study adds much-needed observational data on the outcomes of modified ketogenic diet (MKD) in epilepsy which, like other variations of the ketogenic diet, was employed to optimise the balance between ketosis and palatability. To our knowledge, there is no observational data about the effectiveness of this diet, and outcomes on retention and safety have not yet been reported beyond 3 months [11].",be2a0227-4c0e-41e0-aa76-a5cf99d05e77
22,discussion1," Since adherence to the diet is one of the largest barriers to successfully implementing ketogenic diet therapies [23], more data were needed that describe outcomes of strategies addressing this limitation. This service provided patients with telephone dietetic appointments up to twice per week in addition to regular group education sessions in an attempt to improve adherence.  The proportion achieving a > 50% reduction in seizure frequency in this study is broadly comparable to previous cohort studies of the classic 4:1 [21, 24, 25] or 3:1 ketogenic diet [26]. Compared to studies of modified Atkins diet (MAD), the modified ketogenic diet (MKD) approach used in this study was less effective at reducing seizures than a review of 206 adults on the modified Atkins diet (MAD), where 49% achieved > 50% reduction in seizures [16]. However, diet effectiveness in this study is comparable to a more recent observational study of modified Atkins diet (MAD) in 130 adults [22].",91d20f0a-d9cf-48c0-a148-95b0f3a8f211
23,discussion2," On an ‘as treated’ basis, this includes a similar 3-month responder rate (of 36%) and seizure freedom rate (of 16%), although only one participant (of 40 who commenced modified ketogenic diet (MKD)) remained seizure-free for 1 year in our cohort, compared to 13 (out of 106 who commenced modified Atkins diet (MAD)). Differences between these observational studies likely reflect variations in sample sizes, definition of seizure freedom, epilepsy syndromes [27–29] and dietary differences. Variations in intake of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which may mediate the antiepileptic properties of ketogenic diets might also play a role [30, 31].  Whilst the benefits of modified ketogenic diet (MKD) on seizure frequency described above may support its use as an intervention in refractory epilepsy, it has previously been observed that as many as 17% of patients with refractory epilepsy achieve seizure freedom by continuing their usual medical therapy [32].",acc5e921-561c-4148-a003-2cd30e421cc6
24,discussion3," In addition, we note that the proportion experiencing worsening of seizure frequency was relatively high in this study at 30%, particularly when compared to initiation of new AEDs [33]. This proportion experiencing a worsening in seizure frequency during the study period is consistent with previous dietary studies [16, 22, 34]. Reasons for worsening in seizure frequency may include interactions with AEDs [35], variations in compliance with AEDs, or spontaneous fluctuations in underlying seizure frequency, as has been commonly observed at the initiation of both new AEDs and placebo [36].  Relative to recently described large modified Atkins diet (MAD) cohorts [15, 22], we had a low retention rate of 33% at 1 year. Retention to ketogenic diets is generally poor [37], despite modifications such as the mixed modified Atkins diet (MAD)/classical ketogenic diet [15], owing to various factors including palatability, side effects or lack of benefit [16].",7a32376d-7440-456e-b0e7-dc14fdab355a
25,discussion4," This limits its usefulness in the clinical setting. Lower retention rates in our study most likely reflect the additional challenge of calculating and weighing two variables; both fat and carbohydrate portions, and perhaps the relative palatability of modified ketogenic diet (MKD) compared to modified Atkins diet (MAD), since effectiveness and side effect profiles are similar. For example, the side effects we report are comparable to both the classical KD and modified Atkins diet (MAD), including GI disturbance and weight loss [16, 34]. These data also reflect the first referrals to a new service. Over time, we feel that with gains in clinical experience, there has been an improvement in retention rates, although this has not been formally measured. We aim to repeat this study once the service is further established.  74% of patients in this cohort were female, but we did not find a significant association between gender and retention to modified ketogenic diet (MKD).",453770e7-d17e-4852-83bb-2b3f14592a43
26,discussion5," The high proportion of females in ketogenic diet cohorts is consistent with other studies, such as the Johns Hopkins Adult Epilepsy Diet Center where 71% of diet-naïve participants were female [22]. This group had previously suggested that women may be more likely to want to undergo modified ketogenic diet (MKD) to achieve the secondary goal of weight loss, which was reported by 19% of our participants. In addition to weight loss, our data support the idea that patients may want to initiate modified ketogenic diet (MKD) for other reasons than its putative effect on seizure frequency. For example, 31% of participants in this study reported cognitive benefits of modified ketogenic diet (MKD), including increased mental alertness and improved mood. It has previously been shown that modified ketogenic diet (MKD) increases mental alertness, and that this is associated with both a reduction in seizures and diet itself [38].",4bcc468c-ae5d-4a0b-ad2d-34b0af9c6125
27,discussion6,"  In addition to decreasing body weight and improving mental alertness and mood, we also found that modified ketogenic diet (MKD) caused significant derangement in lipid profiles. This included significant increases in total cholesterol, LDL and HDL, but no change in triglycerides. This is in keeping with a previous report of 37 patients [39]. However, this group reported that LDL and total cholesterol returned to baseline by 12 months, as opposed to this study where levels remained elevated. Nonetheless, due to a relatively greater increase in HDL-cholesterol compared with LDL-cholesterol, the cholesterol:HDL ratio is actually lower at 12 months compared with baseline, potentially mitigating any atherogenic impact. It should also be noted that we describe a small sample, as only 9 of 14 patients who reached 12 months on modified ketogenic diet (MKD) attended to have their lipid profile measured.",15de88c6-a84e-4e88-8491-3bc1b18546ff
28,discussion7," The longer-term effects of lipid derangement in ketogenic diets on cardiovascular health remain unclear [40].  This study has a few limitations. First, the results did not account for changes or adherence to AEDs, which are likely to have affected seizure frequency, although changes in dose or type of AED were not recommended. Second, patients were included irrespective of their baseline seizure frequency allowing small decreases in seizure frequency to be categorised as large effect sizes, e.g. a > 50% reduction. Third, like most ketogenic diet studies, this was an observational study without a control group, precluding any conclusions being drawn about the efficacy of modified ketogenic diet (MKD) in epilepsy compared to placebo or usual treatment alone. Fourth, estimating a true baseline seizure frequency was challenging owing to the large range in reported seizures per day or week for some patients.",b776095f-b01f-4ca3-8761-f3de29c31663
29,discussion8," This study is strengthened by having a low risk of recall bias, since seizure frequency was recorded by patients with dietitians up to twice per week.  In summary, this observational study suggests that modified ketogenic diet (MKD) may be effective as an outpatient treatment option for adults with epilepsy. However, even with intensive dietary support, it remains a challenge for patients to continue the diet long-term, and a significant proportion experience a period of worsening in seizure frequency at some stage. More controlled studies are needed to understand the efficacy of modified ketogenic diet (MKD) in adult epilepsy compared to other dietary interventions and AEDs.
