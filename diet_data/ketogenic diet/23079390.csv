0,introduction0," Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide . Elevated serum cholesterol is a causal risk factor for the development and progression of atherosclerosis . The most widely used treatment for atherosclerosis is statin drugs, which potently inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR)) and dramatically lower cardiovascular mortality . Nevertheless, a substantial fraction of people receiving statin drugs do not tolerate them, with vague muscle aches being the main cause of drug discontinuation (Reinhart and Woods, 2012). Hence, there is considerable interest in identifying alternative strategies for lowering serum cholesterol, including life-style changes, micronutrient supplementation and pharmaceutical development.",5c6a7704-aa2c-477c-ac84-cee4f7ed454d
1,introduction1,"  A greater understanding of the underlying factors regulating lipid metabolism holds the promise of yielding novel therapies. The zebrafish has numerous technical advantages for modeling human diseases (Lieschke and Currie, 2007), and is emerging as a major resource for studying lipid metabolism (Schlegel, 2012; Sadler et al., 2013). First, the zebrafish utilizes a lipid packaging machinery that is conserved among metazoans to transport neutral lipids from their sites of absorption (intestine and yolk) or synthesis (liver) to peripheral organs. The molecular players involved include apolipoproteins  and apolipoprotein processing enzymes (Marza et al., 2005; Schlegel and Stainier, 2006). Following release into the circulation, lipoproteins are modified in zebrafish blood by a machinery that is also highly conserved in evolution. For instance, zebrafish carry an ortholog of the human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)) gene.",d4e11439-2b6b-4d6a-89f8-70016fb74d0c
2,introduction2," A cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) ortholog is frustratingly absent in commonly used rodent models (Haa and Barter, 1982), rendering the study of atherosclerosis difficult: rodents are inherently resistant to atherosclerosis , and background manipulations such as targeted deletion of the Apoe or Ldlr genes are required to drive atherosclerosis. Unlike mice and rats, an ortholog of the human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene is retained in zebrafish, causing the circulating lipoprotein particles to resemble human lipoprotein particles in abundance and composition; this conserved lipoprotein metabolism contributes to the susceptibility of zebrafish to atherosclerosis when placed on a high-cholesterol diet . Furthermore, the deposition of sub-intimal cholesterol can be monitored in real time, in live animals .",286ef13f-2a6f-4bb2-95bd-a7f6e1aa0712
3,introduction3," In addition to their genetic propensity to developing atherosclerosis when placed on high-cholesterol diets, zebrafish develop obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis and characteristic adipocyte gene expression changes when over-fed their normal diet . These effects can be reversed by caloric restriction.  In a forward genetic screen for zebrafish mutants with lipid storage defects, we discovered that the liver has a dedicated β-hydroxybutyrate transporter whose loss causes nutritionally suppressible hepatic steatosis . This transporter normally exports the major ketone bodies produced by the liver under starvation conditions, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, which are partially oxidized short-chain fatty acid catabolites of longer-chain fatty acids and certain amino acids. Together, these ketone bodies are the major fuel of fasting, providing energy to the brain when glucose is depleted (Cahill, 2006).",6fa0ab34-1468-424a-a4c6-e9a7050a2f78
4,introduction4," When administered radiolabeled leucine, a ketogenic amino acid, never-fed zebrafish slc16a6a mutant larvae divert the trapped ketogenic carbon atoms into triacylglycerol exclusively . This selectivity is unanticipated because carbon atoms from mitochondrial leucine catabolism can be funneled to cytoplasmic cholesterol. Specifically, the acetate and acetoacetate generated from leucine breakdown can exit mitochondria and be used to synthesize both fatty acids and cholesterol .  TRANSLATIONAL IMPACT Clinical issue  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Elevated blood cholesterol, which can result in atherosclerotic plaques, is a major risk factor in the development of heart disease; thereby, research has focused on targeting this aspect of disease pathophysiology.",d9086477-92de-4fd4-8f97-9e23a05cb2b8
5,introduction5," Globally, the most widely prescribed drugs are statins, which lower serum cholesterol by inhibiting the rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR)). Although the use of statins has reduced cardiovascular disease mortality rates, many individuals who would benefit from lipid lowering cannot tolerate the drugs because of unpleasant side effects. Notably, the occurrence of muscle aches has been reported in nearly one fifth of people receiving statins. Lowering the dose or switching from one statin to another often fails to alleviate symptoms; therefore, identifying alternative approaches for lowering cholesterol is a priority in cardiovascular disease research.

20,results0," Ketogenic diets cause massive hepatic steatosis in slc16a6a mutants In order to elucidate a molecular mechanism for the selective diversion of ketogenic carbon atoms that we previously observed in zebrafish larvae, we prepared two isocaloric, isoproteic diets that differ in fat content (4% versus 12%, hereafter ‘K4’ and ‘K12’; supplementary material Table S1) and fed them to juvenile animals. Conventional, commercially available adult feeds have relatively high protein and low fat contents (supplementary material Table S2). The diets we prepared have much higher fiber (as opposed to digestible carbohydrates) than commercial diets. We hypothesized that this novel formulation of high protein and low carbohydrate would be ketogenic, and, when fed to slc16a6a mutants, would trigger hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, examining these older, nutritionally sufficient animals would allow us to perform a series of mechanistic experiments that were not feasible in smaller larvae.",e9bf68b2-516c-46d2-b2ef-b215bc3fe4ec
21,results1,"  Consistent with our previous observations, slc16a6a mutants developed massive hepatic steatosis over 45 days on both diets (Fig. 1A). Crucially, this accumulation of cytoplasmic neutral lipid droplets was not accompanied by degenerative changes in hepatocyte architecture (Fig. 1B and supplementary material Fig. S1), unlike what is observed in several other zebrafish mutants with hepatic steatosis (Schlegel, 2012). We were concerned that this short-term ketogenic feeding paradigm might trigger secondary metabolic changes such as hyperglycemia or dyslipidemia that could confound subsequent analysis. More specifically, we wished to avoid triggering an insulin-resistant state that would modify the regulatory apparatus that we wished to uncover in ketogenic states . Thus, the 45-day course of high-protein low-carbohydrate feeding did not cause hyperglycemia or dyslipidemia before proceeding to further analysis (Fig. 1C–F).",a4a5248a-ed25-46e9-bd3e-b7494e7c327f
22,results2," Finally, mutants grew equally well on both diets, and had similar body composition at the conclusion of the feeding period (supplementary material Fig. S2 and Table S3). Taken together, these findings revealed that our experimental design was suitable for establishing a nutrient-sufficient state for exploring selective diversion of ketogenic carbon atoms to triacylglycerol.

Hmgcr is more abundant but less active in slc16a6a mutants To understand why slc16a6a mutants show increased hepatic accumulation of triacylglycerol only, we assessed the abundance and processing into mature, activated N-terminal fragments of the master transcription factors governing triacylglycerol and cholesterol biosynthesis, Srebf1 and Srebf2, respectively (Jeon and Osborne, 2012). In mutant livers from animals fed either diet, both Srebf proteins showed increased maturation into cleaved N-terminal fragments (Fig. 3A). Wild-type (WT) livers showed appropriate suppression of Srebf2 activation in K12-fed animals.",e59c9386-cf10-45e1-926f-228a81dc7428
26,results6," In whole-liver lysates, the degree of Srebf1 processing relative to the total detected was less dramatic than for Srebf2: similar to Srebf1 processing in rat livers, several intermediates of processing and mature fragments of Srebf1 were detected . In purified nuclei, activated Srebf1 was strikingly increased in slc16a6a mutants (Fig. 3A).  Fig. 3. Activation of Srebf pathways in slc16a6a mutant livers.

Next, we measured the steady-state abundance of Srebf-regulated transcripts encoding crucial enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis, de novo fatty acid synthesis, triacylglycerol production and very-low-density lipoprotein (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)) assembly. Mirroring the effect of fasting , slc16a6a mutants on the K4 diet showed increased expression of several transcripts encoding enzymes of these pathways: de novo lipogenesis (acaca, fasn), triacylglycerol synthesis (dgat2) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly (mtp) (Fig. 3B). Likewise, the hmgcra transcript was induced in slc16a6a mutants on the K4 diet.",f646e490-6747-4797-9571-7935e4cc62f1
28,results8," Immunoblot analysis of the rate-limiting enzymes of fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acac), and of Hmgcr showed that the K12 diet suppressed Acac and Hmgcr protein levels in WT animals; however, slc16a6a mutants showed increased abundance of both proteins on both diets (Fig. 3A). These gene expression and protein abundance results indicated that the increase in triacylglycerol in slc16a6a mutant livers might be due, in part, to Acac induction (and of de novo lipogenesis, more generally), but the decrease in cholesterol cannot be explained by a simple decrease in Hmgcr protein. Acac serine phosphorylation on Ser80, a post-translational modification catalyzed by AMP-dependent kinase that serves as a feedback control on enzyme activity, was increased in both slc16a6a mutant groups .",a14f63a2-4184-4cbd-a2bc-21451087bf06
29,results9," Hmgcr is also phosphorylated by AMP-dependent kinase on the conserved Ser868 residue; however, commercial antibodies fail to detect this site because flanking residues are not sufficiently conserved (supplementary material Fig. S3). Hmgcr phosphorylation is an early event in the feedback inhibition of Hmgcr, exerting a maximal inhibition (30% of control) of this enzyme within 20 minutes of gavage of the product mevalonolactone . Over longer periods of time, Hmgcr phosphorylation seems to be a less significant contributor to alterations in rat cholesterol synthesis than Hmgcr protein abundance . Because Hmgcr protein was more abundant in both slc16a6a groups, we were surprised to observe that, in liver homogenates, Hmgcr activity was 40% lower in slc16a6a mutants (Fig. 3C). This reduction in Hmgcr activity was comparable to that seen in WT animals on the K12 diet whose Hmgcr abundance is much lower.",a9d8f356-0d14-4066-aa3c-1cff6d600e70
30,results10," These results suggest that severely decreased Hmgcr activity might explain why liver cholesterol levels are not increased in steatotic slc16a6a mutants.  Decreased Hmgcr activity in the face of increased protein abundance is observed in statin treatment . To assess whether Hmgcr activity is altered in intact animals, we injected them with labeled acetate and mevalonate and monitored tracer incorporation into triacylglycerol and cholesterol. It is important to note that such a labeling approach in higher vertebrates is fraught with technical pitfalls: the mitochondrial pool of acetate can be syphoned into ketone bodies at a rate greater than the cytoplasmic pool can be incorporated into cholesterol, with dose of tracer, duration of labeling and presence of unlabeled acetate greatly influencing the incorporation of label into cholesterol (Dietschy and McGarry, 1974).",62c713f1-2b4c-4559-ac79-6da93368165d
31,results11," Fortunately for us, the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase (Hmgcs2) responsible for this diversion of acetate into ketone bodies is only present in birds and higher vertebrates (Fig. 4A) (Boukaftane et al., 1994; Leblanc and Ballantyne, 2000). Indeed, the absence of Hmgcs2 in zebrafish allowed us to perform leucine labeling in fasting to obtain unambiguous evidence that Slc16a6a is a hepatic ketone body transporter .  Fig. 4. In vivo inhibition of Hmgcr in slc16a6a mutant livers. (A) Ketogenesis involves a series of reactions mostly in the mitochondria of hepatocytes, where fatty-acid-derived and select ketogenic-amino-acid-derived carbon atoms are oxidized to acetoacetate. In this scheme, catabolism of acetate (from fatty acids) and the branched-chain amino acid leucine are shown in detail. The terminal product of this pathway is acetoacetate, which can undergo spontaneous decarboxylation to acetone, or be partially reduced to β-hydroxybutyrate.",ec46fc26-a027-4b4d-a7a7-b6889af397d1
32,results12," When ketone body export is prevented by mutation of zebrafish slc16a6a, the trapped ketone body carbon atoms are diverted to de novo lipogenesis, but not to cholesterol. Cholesterol biosynthesis is prevented by inhibition of Hmgcr by the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)CoAs that accumulate during de novo lipogenesis. The 3H-marked isotopes injected intraperitoneally were used to address whether there was a block in Hmgcr activity in vivo. Note that Hmgcs2 is lacking in zebrafish, eliminating this pathway of acetate consumption. (B,C) Wild-type (WT) and slc16a6a mutant (mutant (MUT)) animals fed ketogenic diets for 45 days were injected intraperitoneally with 3H-labeled acetate and 3H-labeled mevalonate, and the incorporation of radiotracers into cholesterol and triacylglycerol was measured. Results are reported as disintegrations per minute per nanomole of the indicated lipid.

Groups with different letters are statistically different, P≤0.001, two-sided Student’s t-test. All data mean ± s.d. (n=5 per group).  Consistent with the presence of a specific block at the level of Hmgcr, acetate showed greater incorporation into triacylglycerol in mutant livers, whereas mevalonate showed enhanced incorporation into cholesterol (Fig. 4A–C). This latter finding also indicates that the roughly 30 enzymatic steps following Hmgcr in catalyzing cholesterol synthesis are not defective in mutant livers . To address whether Hmgcr inhibition could be achieved outside our ketogenic dietary model, we subjected animals that were maintained on conventional diets to a fast and assessed the incorporation of radiolabeled acetate into cholesterol and triacylglycerol.",eecb3ee0-9e70-4e2a-9b65-5c21257a0be8
34,results14," Consistent with our results in ketogenic-diet-fed animals, slc16a6a mutants showed blunted incorporation of acetate into cholesterol when fasted (Fig. 4D). This result validated our ketogenic dietary paradigm and strongly suggests that Hmgcr activity is inhibited in slc16a6a mutant livers even though the protein is more abundant.  polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-CoAs inhibit Hmgcr To identify an endogenous inhibitor of Hmgcr, we took a candidate approach, focusing on ketone bodies first. We chose these metabolites because CoA thioesters of ketone bodies inhibit carbonic anhydrases in vitro  and β-hydroxybutyrate inhibits histone deacetylases in vivo . These metabolites also share a potential pharmacophore moiety with statin inhibitors of Hmgcr (Fig. 5A).",60d0f903-fcf8-41fe-ad4c-e66f1fa2206d
35,results15," Neither β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA nor acetoacetyl-CoA, however, inhibited human hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) in vitro with a physiologically plausible potency: the inhibition constant (Ki) values for these metabolites were 10-and 14-times greater than the Michaelis-Menten constant (KM) for HMG-CoA, respectively (Fig. 5B). This lack of inhibition also comports with our observation that ketone bodies do not accumulate in slc16a6a livers: the carbon atoms are rerouted to other metabolites (Fig. 2F,G).  Fig. 5. CoA thioesters of ketone bodies are not plausible inhibitors of hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR).

36,results16," (B) Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of human hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) activity with the indicated test inhibitors suggests that neither is physiologically likely: the Ki for both is much higher than the KM for the substrate.  Interestingly, mice have lower serum cholesterol, hepatic cholesterol and hepatic Hmgcr activity when fed a defined diet with very high levels of a single polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) . In addition, intrahepatic fatty acyl-CoAs increase during fasting (Tubbs and Garland, 1964), and Hmgcr is inhibited by select fatty acyl-CoAs in vitro (Kuroda and Endo, 1976; Faas et al., 1977; Faas et al., 1978; Lehrer et al., 1981; Roitelman and Shechter, 1989). Detailed kinetic analyses, however, were not reported in some of these studies and, for short-chain fatty acyl-CoAs, the kinetic parameters do not support physiological inhibition. Fourth, total free fatty acids were increased in slc16a6a mutant livers (Fig. 2D,E).",3013f608-7303-4578-a630-3447b94b0922
37,results17," These observations led to the hypothesis that slc16a6a mutants accumulate fatty acyl chains and their CoA thioesters are inhibitors of Hmgcr.  We found that six FA-CoAs could be reliably detected in wild-type and slc16a6a mutant livers at the conclusion of the feeding study. Palmitoyl-CoA (PA-CoA) was the most abundant species and was increased in both slc16a6a groups. Linolenyl-CoA (LA-CoA) showed a similar increase in slc16a6a groups. The polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-CoAs eicosapentaenyl-CoA (EPA-CoA) and docosahexaenoyl-CoA (DHA-CoA) were not increased in the mutants (Fig. 6A); however, the intermediates of their synthesis, stearidonyl-CoA (SA-CoA) and eicosatetraenyl-CoA (eicosatetraenyl CoA (ETA)), were increased two- to three-fold, although the lack of commercial standards precluded absolute quantification of these two species.

38,results18," (A) The synthetic pathway of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is shown. From plant-derived α-linolenic acid (C18:3), a series of desaturation and elongation reactions generate two species that are the pharmacologically active species in fish oil preparations: eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6). The Δ6-desaturase that catalyzes the conversion of α-linolenic acid to stearidonic acid (C18:4) is strongly expressed in fish species, but not in higher vertebrates. (B) After 45 days on ketogenic diets (K4 or K12), livers were harvested from wild-type (WT) and slc16a6a mutant (mutant (MUT)) livers, and fatty-acyl CoAs were analyzed. Abundance of individual species is normalized to protein mass (left). For stearidonyl-CoA (SA-CoA) and eicosatetraenyl-CoA (eicosatetraenyl CoA (ETA)-CoA) (right), commercial standards are not available, and results are reported as relative abundance (chromatogram area/mg protein).",fa99d3ab-d85b-42dd-a5f8-9f1e68d4df95

(C) Michaelis-Menten analysis of human hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) in the presence of the indicated inhibitors.  Because several fatty acyl-CoA species were more abundant in slc16a6a livers, we tested whether they were inhibitors of human hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) in Michaelis-Menten analysis (Fig. 6B). We included EPA-CoA and DHA-CoA in these studies because they are the active components of pharmaceutical fish oils. We found that LA-CoA, EPA-CoA and DHA-CoA are physiologically plausible competitive hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors (Ki for each was less than the KM for HMG-CoA).",d3277c16-a5d3-4712-88d0-e8d030130a7c
40,results20," Unsaturation seemed to be crucial to this inhibitory activity: Ki of fully saturated PA-CoA is more than double the KM for HMG-CoA, yet its abundance is increased in slc16a6a mutant livers (Fig. 6A).  Although these in vitro findings were promising, the Ki values for polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-CoAs are, nevertheless, higher than those of statin drugs. This suggests that inhibition of Hmgcr by polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-CoAs in vivo requires achieving relatively high intracellular concentrations. We directly tested whether acute administration of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s might decrease Hmgcr activity in vivo by injecting mice intraperitoneally with EPA-ethyl ester (EPA-EE), a pharmacological form of an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) that is limiting in mammals . There was a decrease in hepatic Hmgcr activity observed with the higher dose of EPA-EE (Fig. 7A).",80ab4083-41de-4b44-8a29-52b51907b045
41,results21," Parallel injection of a statin inhibitor of Hmgcr caused a dose-dependent decrease in activity, as well (supplementary material Fig. S4A).

42,results22," There was no difference in Hmgcr protein abundance among the three cohorts.    In this study, the authors exploit the zebrafish model to identify novel strategies for lowering blood cholesterol. They previously identified a zebrafish mutant that fails to release ketone bodies (the major fuel during conditions of starvation) from the liver and develops hepatic steatosis. In this mutant, which lacks a key liver transporter, trapped ketogenic amino acids are selectively diverted to triacylglycerol synthesis instead of cholesterol synthesis. Here, the authors show that, in addition to triacylglycerol, polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulate in the livers of these zebrafish mutants. Furthermore, mutant livers display decreased Hmgcr activity, despite an increase in abundance of this protein.",a779d6e6-6f6e-472a-b357-4022de9a6f84
43,results23," The group demonstrates that coenzyme-A-activated polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-CoAs) inhibit human hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) in vitro, suggesting that these molecules act as an endogenous inhibitor of the enzyme. This conclusion is supported by subsequent in vivo experiments in mice, in which injection of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-CoAs resulted in an acute decrease in Hmgcr activity without affecting protein abundance.  Implications and future directions  This study provides physiological, biochemical and pharmacological evidence that polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-CoAs act as competitive inhibitors of hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and thereby cholesterol synthesis. In addition to revealing a new mechanism by which polyunsaturated fatty acids can regulate lipid biogenesis in vertebrates, the work reveals a new therapeutic candidate for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.",c216cd1b-68ac-4550-88f6-23e4fe9f3e8a
44,results24," Polyunsaturated fatty acids are available in pharmaceutical preparations (fish oil supplements) for lowering serum triglycerides, and future work should focus on testing whether doses of fish oils could be fine-tuned to be used as adjuncts to statins.  Here we identify a molecular mechanism for this selective diversion of carbon atoms to fatty acyl chains and not to cholesterol that has broad implications for the pharmacological suppression of cholesterol synthesis. We trigger severe hepatic steatosis in slc16a6a mutants by feeding them ketogenic diets, and find that, in addition to triacylglycerol, polyunsaturated fatty acid (polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA))-CoAs (activated intermediates of neutral and phospholipid synthesis) accumulate in the mutants’ livers. Furthermore, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-CoAs are competitive inhibitors of Hmgcr in vitro, with physiologically plausible kinetic properties.",230d03b4-b60c-4005-96b0-88b2401aab41
45,results25," Finally, short-term administration of a high dose of a single polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ethyl ester to mice decreases liver Hmgcr activity, without altering Hmgcr protein abundance. Chronic administration of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s to mice disrupts the maturation of sterol-regulatory element binding proteins (SREPBs), the master transcription factors controlling lipid synthesis, and indirectly lowers expression of several genes encoding enzymes involved in fat and cholesterol production (Worgall et al., 1998; Mater et al., 1999; Xu et al., 1999; Yahagi et al., 1999). Furthermore, chronic polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation can ameliorate hepatic steatosis in ob/ob mice through suppressing Srebp1 . Our findings indicate that polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)CoAs (specifically) also have a direct inhibitory effect on Hmgcr activity. These findings elucidate a newly identified beneficial role to high dose fish oil supplementation. ",fd624fbc-a85c-47c7-aa42-fc66c7fcb58a
46,discussion0," Treatment of pandemic atherosclerosis poses a major therapeutic challenge in that the most effective agents – statin hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors – are not uniformly tolerated. Furthermore, large adequately powered trials of statins in combination with a fibrate, niacin or inhibitors of cholesterol absorption have not demonstrated added benefit, despite enhanced lipid lowering (Baigent et al., 2011; Ginsberg et al., 2010; Boden et al., 2011). Furthermore, unanticipated side effects such as renal impairment , and muscle and liver injury are observed in these trials (HPS2-THRIVE Collaborative Group, 2013).  Although our initial goal in this work was to address why blocking ketone body secretion triggers a triacylglycerol-only steatosis, we have uncovered a novel therapeutic possibility for overcoming the therapeutic shortcoming of statin adjuvants.",c69937cd-69fe-47eb-8826-1e0b18e0ca44
47,discussion1," By developing high-protein ketogenic diets, we were able to create experimental conditions for demonstrating that, when export of ketone bodies from the liver is impaired, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-CoAs accumulate. Because zebrafish can synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s from plant-derived dietary unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) , this model organism provided a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s on cholesterol synthesis in a vertebrate. Our findings in this organism indicate that liver-trapped carbon atoms can accumulate into polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s that are not only incorporated into triacylglycerol, but their CoA thioesters inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Metabolite-based modulation of Hmgcr activity seems to occur in parallel to known direct regulators of this enzyme, such as phosphorylation or proteasome-mediated degradation (Burg and Espenshade, 2011).",596cff44-5f65-4873-b6bd-46ba79588958
48,discussion2,"  Chronic polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation also impairs Srebp1c maturation in mice, and thereby limits de novo lipogenesis. polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-mediated Srebp1c inhibition seems to involve two mechanisms. The first involves the altered biophysical properties of endoplasmic reticulum membranes when polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s are incorporated in phospholipid side chains: such incorporation into phospholipids suppresses the unfolded protein response, a potent trigger of Srebp1c activation (Ariyama et al., 2010; Lagace and Ridgway, 2013). The second mechanism of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-mediated Srebp1c inhibition involves antagonism of Liver X receptor (Lxr)-driven induction of Srebp1c expression . These mechanisms governing Srebp1 regulation act in parallel to one another, and with still other known pathways.",bdcefd19-76d3-4db9-81a1-7c82291698c3
49,discussion3," For instance, chronic fish oil supplementation triggers selective repression of mouse nuclear Srebp1c accumulation, and accelerates Srebp1c proteosomal degradation; interestingly, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements seem to have no effect on Srebp2 . Zebrafish seem to have only a single srebf1 transcript variant, unlike higher vertebrates, in whom two major variants encoding Srebp1a and Srebp1c are present. Zebrafish have a single Lxrα ortholog, making this model organism potentially useful for examining Srebp regulation by Lxr in the future .  Thus, our in vitro studies with purified human hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) catalytic domains indicate that acute hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibition by their CoA thioesters is another mode whereby polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s regulate lipid metabolism.",f930c994-893c-4a3e-b9a9-44e0e53f049f
50,discussion4," polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-CoAs seem to be unique in their ability to inhibit hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), in that fully saturated PA-CoA had physiologically implausible kinetic parameters. Likewise, the short course of EPA-EE decreased Hmgcr activity in mouse liver homogenates, without altering Hmgcr abundance. Thus, contrary to initial reports (Taketa and Pogell, 1966; Zahler et al., 1968) but consistent with later observations (Powell et al., 1981; Constantinides and Steim, 1985), fatty acyl-CoAs are not merely detergents that denature a broad range of enzymes.  Although feeding of high-DHA diets lowers serum cholesterol, reduces hepatic cholesterol content and lowers hepatic Hmgcr activity in mice , conventional fish oil doses (rich in DHA and EPA) do not lower serum cholesterol in humans . This contrasts with the low total cholesterol seen in native Greenlanders (Bang et al.",6370495b-95ce-448a-a80d-561e874b819d
51,discussion5,", 1971), a population that consumes diets very high in n-3 fatty acids and has a very low prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis . Moreover, diets high in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s are associated with low levels of serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol in many populations, and with low incidence of atherosclerosis . Promisingly, high-dose supplementation with fish oils rich in DHA has a fairly potent serum-cholesterol-lowering effect even in the setting of statin-treated dyslipidemia, particularly if the total cholesterol remained high following statin initiation . Likewise, trials of high-dose EPA report a similar cholesterol- and triacylglycerol-reducing effect, even when EPA is combined with a statin . Crucially, a lower dose of fish oil supplementation does not confer cardiovascular protection .",23bfa03f-5b8e-40c4-9c78-a20934a336f0
52,discussion6,"  In addition to these dose considerations, the formulation of fish oils affects serum cholesterol parameters. Conventional fish oil preparations (ethyl esters of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) mixtures) cause a striking increase in serum LDL cholesterol, often in proportion to the robust serum triacylglycerol lowering effect . These effects seem to be related to the amount of DHA-EE relative to EPA-EE in the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-EE formulations studied (Jacobson et al., 2012a), although this hypothesis has been challenged (Baum, 2012; Jacobson et al., 2012b). Newer formulations of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s with greater oral bioavailability than polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-EEs have been prepared, and they seem to not raise LDL cholesterol .",9a36d050-70d5-4406-a738-51b4e5ccdd4a
53,discussion7," We found that both DHA-CoA and EPA-CoA inhibited human hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) in vitro with kinetic parameters consistent with in vivo relevance. Because the weight of clinical evidence points to EPA-EE as having LDL-cholesterol-lowering properties, we chose to administer this single species to mice. Recognizing that mice have extensive intestinal first-pass metabolism that differs substantially from humans (Komura and Iwaki, 2008), we administered EPA-EE intraperitoneally, and achieved a dose-dependent decrease in hepatic Hmgcr activity. These pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic concerns will, ultimately, be addressed only by hard outcomes clinical trials: a phase III mortality trial of pure EPA-EE (REDUCE-IT, NCT01492361) should provide these answers.  In summary, we have presented biochemical, physiological and pharmacological evidence that Hmgcr is inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-CoAs.",ec63bb91-6041-4130-81b2-2ccb55cd9d11
54,discussion8, Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for the long-standing epidemiological observations that consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich diets is associated with low serum cholesterol and lower incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. They also support developing and testing new formulations of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements for lowering cholesterol.  ,e630cf6a-6e3b-4811-8d8c-82b093ba092b
