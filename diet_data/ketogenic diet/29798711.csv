0,introduction0,"Medium chain triglyceride-based (Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) ketogenic diets are currently proposed as alternative brain energy substrates in conditions of limited cerebral glucose availability, such as in traumatic brain injury (traumatic brain injury (TBI)) (Prins and Matsumoto, 2014; Bernini et al., 2018), patients with glucose transporter 1 deficiency (Krass et al., 2016) and Alzheimer’s disease (Reger et al., 2004; Castellano et al., 2015; Cunnane et al., 2016; Croteau et al., 2018). Moreover, besides having antioxidant properties (Jarrett et al., 2008), ketogenic diets were reported to be important in seizure control in epileptic patients (Pulford, 1927; Neal et al., 2008). Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)s are glycerolesters usually carrying a mixture of octanoic (C8:0) and decanoic (C10:0) acid. Yet, the rationale behind the selection of C8:0 and C10:0 is unclear.",958ae692-4628-4da8-b41f-30e5c641473f
1,introduction1," Upon supplementation, Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) are hydrolyzed in the gut, which leads to an increase in the plasma concentrations of the medium chain fatty acids (medium chain fatty acids (MCFA)) (i.e., C8:0 and C10:0) (Bernini et al., 2018). In the brain, medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) cross the blood-brain barrier (Wlaź et al., 2015) and are oxidized in cells (Ebert et al., 2003) through β-oxidation for acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) generation and subsequent production of ketone bodies (Auestad et al., 1991), namely β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc). Those produced ketone bodies can further be used as metabolic fuel by the brain (Nugent et al., 2014; Andersen et al., 2017; Evans et al., 2017).  While astrocytes have been restricted to a scaffold-associated function in the brain for decades, new lines of evidence suggest the important role of astrocytic oxidative metabolism for supporting brain function (Sonnay et al.",f1d1cc0f-191b-49f2-803c-a21818227eed
2,introduction2,", 2016, 2017, 2018), as well as the preferential stimulation of astrocytic metabolism by fatty acids, and subsequent ketone bodies production (Edmond et al., 1987; Thevenet et al., 2016).  Based on our initial observations (Thevenet et al., 2016) and although C10:0 and C8:0 differ in length by only two carbons, we hypothesize that they differ in their ability to contribute to ketogenesis. In astrocytes, the metabolic pathways giving rise to ketone bodies remain unclear (Thevenet et al., 2016) and new insights into astrocytic ketogenesis and β-oxidation may help to define the optimal medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) composition of the ketogenic diets. We have recently observed a significant but modest increase in plasma C8:0 and C10:0 in the subset of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients after receiving high level Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) enteral nutrition (Bernini et al., 2018).",ae275c59-0773-4c48-aff5-49e79a732164
3,introduction3," Interestingly, administration of higher Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) concentrations, compared to commonly used formula, did not have significant impact on the level of ketones produced. This further confirms the importance of identifying the optimal formulation to raise brain ketones to therapeutically relevant levels.  Therefore, we investigated β-oxidation of C8:0 and C10:0 to assess the underlying metabolic network, differences in metabolic flux pathways and ketogenesis at the basal level. We aimed to provide insights into the production of ketones in the brain and potential differences in metabolic properties of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA), namely differential secretions of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) intermediates and glutathione formation. Using our established cellular model (Thevenet et al.",a1816757-f879-4ddd-b476-a94ededccd5f
4,introduction4,", 2016), we tracked the metabolism of [U-13C]-C8:0 and [U-13C]-C10:0 in differentiated human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC) astrocytes by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), conducted an integrated analysis in silico to identify and characterize specific reactions leading to the production of βHB, and formulated a reduced (sub-network) astrocyte-specific mathematical model of β-oxidation that was fitted to the experimental data (Figure 1A). The results indicate significant differences in medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) metabolism. In particular, astrocytes incubated with C8:0 release βHB, AcAc and butyrate in larger amounts and at higher rates than with C10:0, with the major fraction coming from unlabeled substrates (irrespectively of the initial medium chain fatty acids (MCFA)).",b2feda44-aeb6-4b92-a75d-f2d408d481a0
5,introduction5," Moreover, flux analysis indicates opposite direction of metabolic flux between the medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) intermediates C8:0 and C6:0, with an important fraction of unlabeled sources contributing to the elongation steps in the case of C10:0, suggesting different β-oxidation pathways. Finally, larger intracellular glutathione concentrations, indicating potential additional antioxidant benefits, as well as higher secretions of 3-OH-C10:0 and C6:0 were measured in C10:0-treated astrocytes. Overall, these findings suggest C8:0- and C10:0-specific ketometabolic traits relevant for further studies on designing optimal ketogenic nutritional interventions using appropriate C8:0/C10:0 ratios to reach specific health benefits.  Figure 1  (A) Overview of the experimental set-up and study design. Human iPSC astrocytes were treated with [U-13C]-C8:0 or [U-13C]-C10:0.

Sample Preparation A 0.1–0.5 μM internal standard solution was prepared by mixing individual stock solutions with mobile phase A. This solution contained heavy labeled compounds, which do not interfere with measured isotopomers and was used to dilute media samples and reconstitute cell extracts.  Cells were prepared as previously described (Thevenet et al., 2016). Briefly, iPSC astrocytes were washed three times and incubated in serum- and glutamine- free DMEM A14430-01 (Thermo Scientific-Life Technologies) containing 1 mM glucose, N2 supplement, and 300 μM [U-13C]-C8:0 or [U-13C]-C10:0 for up to 6 h (1 ml/well).",800aa2d1-4519-4ec6-919c-a08f4fae2d07

12,methods5," Supernatants were dried under vacuum at room temperature and the solid residues were reconstituted in 30 μl of mobile phase A and immediately analyzed. The pellets were stored at −80°C until protein content quantification.  Protein Content Protein content was determined with a bicinchoninic acid-based protein assay (BCA protein assay kit 10678484; Thermo Scientific) with bovine serum albumin as standard.  Biochemical Pathway Analysis The objectives of this analysis were to identify astrocyte-specific metabolic intermediates and metabolic routes of C8:0-C10:0 to βHB transformation including key intermediates (e.g., AcCoA, AcAc and 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl glutarate (HMG)). This consisted of two steps. The first step was the enumeration of paths from compound of interest (i.e., C8:0-C10:0) and target of interest (i.e., βHB). In this regard, we used the KEGG database (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Kanehisa et al., 2016, 2017) and specifically, the PathComp methodology (Goto et al.",96d3220b-58cd-4e88-904b-f191cf3d98ab
13,methods6,", 1997) to identify the human-specific metabolic paths between the compounds of interest. We limited the search of paths to a maximum length of 20 (i.e., 20 biochemical transformations from the starting compound). The second step was the refinement of the transformations identified in step one based on genome scale metabolic models (i.e., astrocyte specificity) (Schultz and Cutub, 2016). In this regard, we used the astrocyte-neuronal metabolic model published by Özcan and Çakır (2016). The model provided curated astrocyte-specific metabolic information for 276 metabolites interacting across 375 reactions. Out of the metabolites and reactions participating in the paths identified in the first step, only those implicated in the astrocyte model were considered for further analysis.  Network analysis and visualization of paths, interconnectivities, and cellular specificities were performed using custom Matlab (Mathwork Inc.) scripts and edited using yEd (yWorks GmbH).",62f0a5eb-4dbc-4ed0-b4be-dd8d54ed9639
14,methods7,"  Modeling of Experimental 13C Curves Chromatogram extraction using a mass tolerance of 5 ppm and calculation of ratios of mass isotopomers to internal standard were performed in Xcalibur Software 2.2 SP1. Absolute concentrations were calculated by multiplying the area ratio by the internal standard amount. Time-course data (cells and media) were subtracted to initial conditions (i.e., cells and media before incubation, respectively) and normalized to protein content. Similar procedure was performed in an unrelated cell line (i.e., HepG2 cells) under similar experimental conditions for astrocytic-specificity measurements validation. Key metabolites are reported in Supplementary Figure S1. Then, correction for substrate purity and natural abundance of the isotope, and calculation of fractional enrichments (FE) were performed with IsoCor Software 1.0 (Millard et al., 2012). Mass isotopomers differ by the number of 13C atoms in the molecule.",2753e054-f20a-4a1a-89ec-71c178cc7c15
15,methods8," C0 represents the fraction of unlabeled molecules in the total molecule pool, C1 the fraction of molecules labeled in one carbon, C2 in two carbons, etc. The sum of all fractions is one.  Isotopic transient 13C-metabolic flux analysis of [U-13C]-C8:0 and [U-13C]-C10:0 through β-oxidation was based on the intracellular and extracellular detection of the derivative metabolites. FE < 1% were not considered in the modeling process, because they were associated with large uncertainty. The metabolic model describing 13C labeling was solved mathematically by a set of linear differential mass isotopomer-balance equations describing the stoichiometry of the system at equilibrium and assuming negligible cellular growth (Supplementary Data).",4caecf94-f8bc-41b5-9eec-69076329a373
16,methods9," Metabolic steady-state and isotopic transient-state were considered during the experiment, as during incubation of the labeled substrate, the total intracellular pools of free acids remained unchanged and the distribution of mass isotopomers changed with time according to the flux network. The model was fitted to the experimental measurements by minimizing the residual sum of squares using least square regression. Variance of the estimated fluxes was calculated with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using artificially generated dataset by adding Gaussian noise with similar variance of the fit residuals to the best fit. Initial values were randomly generated within confidence interval of the obtained fluxes. All numerical procedures were performed in Matlab (Mathwork Inc.).  All pool sizes were determined from the LC-MS measurements, except the pool of AcCoA, whose value was set to 0.027 μmol/mg prot (Amaral et al., 2011).",ed6c62bc-68f8-4183-a59f-5fc1bf3134fd
17,methods10," As extracellular metabolite concentrations increased over time, net specific transmembrane rates were calculated experimentally from the slope of a linear regression to those changes. The resulting values were fixed in the modeling process.  Statistics Data are shown as mean ± SD. For experimental measurements, the SD was determined from three independent experiments, which were run in duplicate. For metabolic fluxes, the SD was determined from fitting a Gamma function to the histograms obtained from at least 500 MC. Flux comparison between C8:0 an C10:0 experiments was performed by permutation analysis with 2000 permutations followed by individual two-tailed student t-test. Experimental measurements comparison between C8:0 and C10:0 experiments was also performed by individual two-tailed student t-test. All reported p’s were corrected for multiple comparisons using Holm-Bonferroni method (Holm, 1979). All calculations include error propagation. ",ffe57b96-6f0c-4f77-aaef-98da102d50cd
18,results0,"Ketone Bodies Secretion To determine the contribution of C8:0 and C10:0 to the release of ketone bodies, butyrate, and HMG in the medium, mass isotopomers, namely βHB (C0, C2, C4), AcAc (C0, C2, C4), HMG (C0, C1, C2), and butyrate (C2, C3, C4), were quantified over time. The release rates were calculated by linear fitting of these extracellular concentration profiles (total = labeled + unlabeled) and the areas under the curve (areas under the curve (AUC)) of the total concentrations were determined (Figure 1B). In particular, a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in secretion rates and areas under the curve (AUC) of total βHB, total AcAc, and total butyrate was observed in the C10:0 experiment as compared to the C8:0. Noticeably, there was a different time delay of ketone secretion between the C8:0 and C10:0 condition.",154373ea-dac4-42c5-9cf1-62d1e52ac821
19,results1," In the C8:0 experiment, secretion of βHB, AcAc, and butyrate was detected at time 30, 120, and 30 min, respectively, while in the C10:0 condition, it was detected at time 60, 240, and 120 min, respectively (Figure 1C). These results indicate that both the rates of secretion and the total amounts of produced ketone bodies and butyrate are higher when astrocytes metabolize C8:0 compared to C10:0. No difference in total HMG secretion rate and areas under the curve (AUC) were measured.  Separation of the data into concentrations of mass isotopomers is shown in Figures 1C,D. In particular, in the case of AcAc a decrease (p < 0.001) in both areas under the curve (AUC) and secretion rates were measured in the unlabeled and fully labeled fractions of the C10:0 as compared to the C8:0 experiment. The secretion rate of AcAc C2 was also significantly lower (p < 0.001) in the C10:0 condition as compared to the C8:0.",2a6b0355-0b0d-4999-8151-f02080cb91ba
20,results2," The secretion rates and areas under the curve (AUC) of βHB C2 and βHB C4 were also significantly different according to the medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) under investigation. A significant decrease of βHB C4 secretion rate (p < 0.001) and areas under the curve (AUC) (p < 0.001) was detected in the C10:0 condition as compared to the C8:0. The opposite was found for βHB C2 secretion rate (p < 0.001) and areas under the curve (AUC) (p < 0.01). No significant difference was measured in the areas under the curve (AUC) of the different mass isotopomers of HMG. However, the secretion rate of HMG C2 was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the C10:0 condition as compared to C8:0. Regarding butyrate, larger (p < 0.001) secretion rates and areas under the curve (AUC) were identified in C3 and C4 in the C8:0 condition as compared to the C10:0.

In the case of the C8:0 to βHB transformation space, we identified 73 paths (minimum length 10, maximum length 20), involving 84 unique metabolites interconnected by 91 unique reactions (Figure 2A), considering the overall human metabolism. Similarly, in the case of the C10:0 to βHB transformation space, we identified 67 paths (minimum length 10, maximum length 20), involving 82 unique metabolites interconnected by 89 unique reactions (Figure 2B).",5a7bc57b-8580-4a9d-9a04-75e1246c0367

These filtered paths were used as the biochemical transformation space for analysis of C8:0 and C10:0 metabolism, and formulation of flux models (sub-networks). On one hand, these paths showed complete paths from C8:0-C10:0 to βHB, highlighting key intermediates (e.g., AcCoA, AcAc, and HMG). On the other hand, they also highlighted astrocyte-specific metabolic intermediates of C8:0-C10:0 degradation, wherein carbon introduced as C8:0-C10:0 could accumulate without being transformed to target compound formation (e.g., βHB and butyrate) (Figures 2A,B).",77c84136-bbd9-45b7-bb56-79427f1fdabd

Modeling of the Experimental 13C-Labeled Curves The mathematical model of β-oxidation to the production of βHB (Figure 3) used to fit the 13C isotopomer FE curves was based on Figure 2 and restricted to the detection of the mass isotopomers of the medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) intermediates by LC-MS. In particular, only the fully labeled and fully unlabeled parts of the medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) intermediates could be detected in both intracellular and extracellular space. Only unlabeled hexanoic acid (C6:0) was detected intracellularly, while both fully labeled and fully unlabeled fractions could be measured extracellularly. None of the mass isotopomer of butyrate could be detected intracellularly (presumably because the volatile butyric acid evaporated during extraction (solvent removal) under vacuum), while butyrate C2, C3, and C4 were present in the medium.",05fc450f-1129-41d3-9d53-a0819eca83af

The network applied to the C8:0 data is shown in grey in Figure 3. It was extended (in red) to the C10:0 data. Although labeled 3-OH-C10:0 and C10:0 was detected in the medium (Figure 4), this extended model was not applied to the C8:0 data, because no labeled 3-OH-C10:0 could be detected intracellularly and FE of intracellular C10:0 was associated with large SD (FE < 1%). A dilution flux at the level of AcCoA (F13) was added to take into account potential utilization of unlabeled substrates present in the medium, namely glucose (Zwingmann and Leibfritz, 2003) and amino acids (i.e., isoleucine and leucine) (Bixel and Hamprecht, 1995; Dienel and Cruz, 2009).",67644a77-2e37-4db5-a4f2-ede9dfdcbe07

31,discussion0,"Although Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-based ketogenic diets have received growing interest during the past few years, metabolism of C8:0 and C10:0 remains unclear. Thus, understanding the kinetics of βHB production and β-oxidation from medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) would allow us to better define the rationale for optimal ketogenic composition to not only better provide ketones in the brain but also take advantage of other metabolic properties to reach specific health benefits. Based on the differences observed on the redox ratio produced by the oxidation of C8:0 and C10:0 (Thevenet et al., 2016), and on the fact that administration of higher level Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) did not have a significant impact on the concentration of ketone bodies in the brain of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, as compared to a standard formula (Bernini et al.",31dad9e5-9792-43d3-aa85-40fa844ff71f
32,discussion1,", 2018), we aimed at tracking the basal production of βHB from C8:0 and C10:0 at the cellular level using metabolic flux analysis with13C-labeled substrates. In this regard, we conducted an integrative analysis in silico of ketometabolism in astrocytes, as well as experimental analysis using [U-13C]-C8:0 and [U-13C]-C10:0. Overall, this study demonstrates that the metabolic pathways underlying the β-oxidation of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) of different lengths, namely C8:0 and C10:0, to the production of ketone bodies differ in human iPSC astrocytes. This differences stand not only in the total amount and mass isotopomers of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) intermediates and ketone bodies that are secreted, but also in the intracellular fluxes.  We observed that astrocytes incubated with C8:0 secreted more ketone bodies, namely βHB and AcAc, as well as butyrate, both in terms of production rates and total concentrations, compared to C10:0.",b86795df-0c25-4d43-b186-877a1807e638
33,discussion2," Interestingly, most of the ketone bodies production arose from unlabeled sources present in the medium, suggesting that iPSC astrocytes do not exclusively require medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) to produce βHB. This observation could in part explain the lack of increase in ketone bodies recently measured in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients (Bernini et al., 2018). The larger extracellular concentration of βHB found in the case of C8:0 is in line with our previous report, in which unlabeled C8:0 stimulated ketogenesis, as compared to unlabeled C10:0 and control (Thevenet et al., 2016). Furthermore, in the same study, extracellular βHB levels were similar in C10:0 and control experiments, indicating that iPSC astrocytes have the ability to produce βHB in the absence of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) (Thevenet et al., 2016). In addition, more fully labeled βHB (βHB C4) was produced under C8:0, while more partially labeled βHB (βHB C2) was secreted under C10:0.",9ee472f7-00ae-43e3-a50b-89288d9ae520
34,discussion3," As the concentration of unlabeled βHB was similar between the two conditions (Figure 1D), the larger production of βHB in the case of C8:0 came from βHB C4 (Figures 1B–D). The secretion profile of AcAc, the precursor of βHB (Figure 6B) (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Kanehisa et al., 2016, 2017), was different to the one of βHB. In particular, while C8:0 produced more AcAc C4 than C10:0, data also suggested that C8:0 increased the production of unlabeled AcAc from other unlabeled sources (Figures 1B–D). Additionally, the total amount (areas under the curve (AUC)) of AcAc C2 produced by the end of the experiment was the same for C8:0 and C10:0 experiments. To understand the relationship between AcAc and βHB, it may be relevant to take HMG into consideration. HMG arises from the combination of a two-carbon molecule (AcCoA) and a four-carbon molecule (AcAc).",d14af338-1eea-41c9-8988-adf56687555c
35,discussion4," Yet, no HMG C4 was detected in the medium and no difference in total and unlabeled production of HMG between C8:0 and C10:0 could be measured. Under the assumption that an enzyme should catalyze a reaction (in terms of rate) unreceptively of the labeling counterparts, these results indicate possible cellular compartmentalization of ketone bodies production.  Butyrate is downstream of 3-OH-C6:0, and in terms of carbon flow from C8:0-C10:0 to βHB in astrocytes, it can be considered as a “carbon sink” (Figure 2). While significant labeled amount was measured in the medium, unlabeled butyrate was not present, suggesting that the production of butyrate is specific to the labeled substrates. Astrocytes treated with C8:0 secreted more butyrate C4 as compared to C10:0, in line with larger release and intracellular FE of fully labeled 3-OH-C6:0.",e55ebe05-20b2-4c65-a9d2-c8acc3d10a62
36,discussion5," The production of butyrate C2 was, on the other hand, larger in the case of C10:0 than C8:0, and could arise from scrambling of AcCoA C2 with unlabeled 3-OH-C6:0. The fact that no C2-labeled medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) and no unlabeled butyrate was detected indicate different production rate and possible cellular compartmentalization. While it is recognized that medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) undergo β-oxidation in mitochondria, very long chain fatty acids (of length of 24 or higher) are oxidized in peroxisomes with hexanoyl as a final product (Wanders et al., 2001). It was moreover reported that medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) can be synthetize both in the cytosol by the fatty acid synthase complex (Volpe and Kishimoto, 1972; Angeles and Hudkins, 2016) (KEGG database) and in mitochondria (reversal of β-oxidation) (KEGG database) (Hinsch et al., 1976; Murad and Kishimoto, 1978).",ced6449a-b5ec-4034-9557-624a954fece9
37,discussion6,"  In the description of the FE curves, we included a dilution flux at the level of AcCoA, which not only reflects the production of unlabeled ketone bodies, but is also necessary to explain the important contribution of unlabeled carbons in the FE curves of the medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) intermediates. The elongation fluxes (from AcCoA to medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) production) were included based on the mass isotopomer contribution of unlabeled carbons and on the detection of labeled C10:0 and 3-OH-C10:0 in the medium of C8:0-incubated astrocytes (Figure 4). However, the latter was not included in the C8:0 experiment, because intracellular 3-OH-C10:0 and C10:0 were not detectable and associated with high uncertainty, respectively, and therefore could not be fitted by the model.  Analysis of the fluxes obtained with the mathematical model indicated opposite direction of metabolic flux at specific steps (i.e.",216a727c-3187-4e3f-8f5c-2bf69734c165
38,discussion7,", F6-F6inv and F8-F8inv), suggesting different C8:0 and C10:0 β-oxidation pathways. In particular in the C8:0 experiment, F6-F6inv and F8-F8inv are directed toward the production of βHB consistent with larger production of βHB C4 and AcAc C4. In the case of C10:0, unlike C8:0, the fraction of labeled carbons drastically decreased at the level of C8:0 (about 5% at 360 min) and stayed stable thereafter (i.e., in 3-OH-C8:0 and 3-OH-C6:0), suggesting that an important carbon flow from unlabeled sources (F13) at the level of AcCoA must occur and contribute to the upstream pools (notably through F8inv and F6inv). As a result, even if both C8:0- and C10:0-treated astrocytes rely on significant contribution of unlabeled substrates, a larger dilution occurs in the case of C10:0. Amaral et al. calculated that the consumption rate of isoleucine and leucine are about 10 times smaller than for glucose (Amaral et al.",d2b99c58-3bfe-4087-a866-df3a2fafbb5e
39,discussion8,", 2011), in line with the general observation that glucose is the main energy substrate for the brain cells including astrocytes (Zwingmann and Leibfritz, 2003; Thevenet et al., 2016). Therefore, it seems reasonable to attribute the dilution at the level of AcCoA (F13) to glucose. In fact, as reported in our previous study (Thevenet et al., 2016), the large lactate/βHB ratio secretion rate and the unchanged ATP levels when inhibiting mitochondrial ATP synthesis indicate that glucose remains the main energy substrate in our experimental conditions even in the presence of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA). Interestingly, reduced glycolysis and decrease phosphofructokinase activity in the case of C8:0 was reported by Tan et al. (2017), and larger lactate release upon C10:0 as compared to C8:0 was measured by Thevenet et al. (2016). F13 was estimated to be 0.187 ± 0.017 μmol/g prot/min and 0.490 ± 0.",c75172b9-9244-49ca-8ee0-5c206186681b
40,discussion9,"045 μmol/g prot/min in the C8:0 and C10:0 experiment, respectively, which is in line with these previous reports (Thevenet et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2017).  While the secretion of ketone bodies comprised mostly of the unlabeled fractions, larger amounts of labeled than unlabeled medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) intermediates were secreted (Figure 4). Moreover, the extracellular secretion profile of the medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) intermediates was different in the C8:0 and C10:0 experiments. In the case of C8:0, labels were mostly secreted as hydroxy-(3-OH) molecules, except for 3-OH-C10:0 that was secreted in a larger extent in the C10:0 condition. The opposite direction of metabolic flux estimated in the present study suggests different C8:0 and C10:0 β-oxidation pathways, and potential modulation when both medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are simultaneously provided (Khabbush et al., 2017).",39036b39-7a5a-4c32-9339-b98743113488
41,discussion10," These observations support our hypothesis that C8:0 and C10:0 could exhibit different biological functions due to their different metabolism, and that their beneficial effects may not be limited to production of ketones. Interestingly, 3-OH-C10:0 was shown to depolarize the squid giant axon in inhibiting the sodium channels (Takenaka et al., 1981) and C10:0 was reported to be more anticonvulsant than C8:0 (Chang et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2017). In addition to the direct inhibition of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (amino 3 hydroxy 5 methyl 4 isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)) receptors (Chang et al., 2016), we speculate that this additional anti-seizure effect could be due to production of 3-OH-C10:0; however, this requires further investigation. We, moreover, observed that secretion of C6:0 was higher in C10:0 as compared to C8:0.",821b6b61-c2ea-4a2d-a95d-b046db5ea7f2
42,discussion11," Although the function of C6:0 is unclear, it is worth mentioning that C6:0 was shown to contribute to energy metabolism (Ishiwata et al., 1996), as well as to induce neurite growth (Kamata et al., 2007). All together, these results point to different metabolic network activation and biological functions depending on the carbon length of the substrate. This suggests that the underlying enzymes are substrate-specific, preferentially catalyzing molecules of specific chain lengths and/or adapting to the requirements of specific cellular states, potentially impacting differently the cellular environment.  Finally, an increase in intracellular unlabeled glutathione concentration was observed over time. This increase was significantly higher by the end of the experiment in the C10:0 condition, indicating potential benefits of C10:0 as compared to C8:0 in terms of antioxidant properties.",2bfd5849-8d89-46ae-aa39-b52ce95c2da4
43,discussion12," This observation is consistent with the earlier findings of increased brain reduced glutathione levels in rats given C10:0-enriched oil (Sengupa and Ghosh, 2012) and higher expression of genes regulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes in the hippocampus of mice fed with C10:0 as compared to C8:0 (Tan et al., 2017), suggesting therefore potential beneficial effects related to C10:0. Although further experiments are needed to further assess the link between glutathione and C10:0, it is noteworthy that C10:0 is an agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)) α (Malapaka et al., 2012) involved in glutathione level modulation (Abdelmegeed et al., 2009).  In conclusion, while C8:0 and C10:0 appear structurally similar, as they differ in length by only two carbons, the metabolic pathways underlying their metabolism are different in human iPSC astrocytes.",2ca7ab99-a734-430e-807f-e4295e11ce4b
44,discussion13," In particular, flux analysis indicate opposite direction of metabolic flux at specific steps, with an important fraction of unlabeled sources contributing to the elongation steps in the case of C10:0, suggesting different C8:0 and C10:0 β-oxidation pathways. The total extracellular concentrations and secretion rates of βHB, AcAc and butyrate are higher and faster, respectively, in the case of C8:0, while intracellular glutathione formation and secretions of 3-OH-C10:0 and C6:0 were larger with C10:0. Overall, the findings suggest medium chain fatty acids (MCFA)-specific ketometabolic traits, which could be of interest for personalized nutritional intervention and the design of optimal ketogenic diet supplementation. Further studies involving different ratios of C8:0/C10:0 in appropriate models of glucose metabolism impairment are required to investigate sustainable and targeted ketone production, with optimal antioxidant and anticonvulsant impacts.",7056f1c6-c723-40bb-b295-d729a4baf52d
