0,introduction0,"Epilepsy is characterized by the occurrence of unprovoked seizures, which result from excessive, synchronous, abnormal electrical firing patterns of a population of neurons1, 2. Normal brain function is dependent upon the balance between inhibition and excitation in neuronal circuits. Disruption of this balance, by increasing excitatory processes3–5 or by decreasing or losing inhibitory mechanisms6–8, leads to uncontrolled neuronal activity or epileptiform activity, producing augmented glutamate release, which in turn is sensed by astrocytes via metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), resulting in changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels9, 10.  Epilepsy affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide, of which more than ¼ of patients remain pharmacoresistant. Ketogenic diet (KD) is a treatment employed in patients with refractory epilepsy, particularly children. KD is a high-fat diet with adequate protein and low carbohydrates.",645e4061-8932-4ce0-9589-6153a76bf38e
1,introduction1," It was developed to mimic the physiological effects of fasting without starvation, a treatment reported to control seizure activity11–13. While it is known that KD reduces the incidence of seizures, the mechanisms of action are not completely understood14, 15. KD forces the body to metabolize fat rather than carbohydrates. The oxidation of fatty acids produces acetyl-CoA, which cannot be entirely used in the Krebs cycle, and is shunted into the ketogenesis pathway to produce the ketone bodies (KB) acetoacetate (ACA) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which are released into the blood stream, from where they can enter the brain tissue and brain cells via monocarboxylate transporter 1 (monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1). monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)s transport high energy metabolites like lactate and pyruvate, but also ACA and BHB together with H+ in a stoichiometry of 1:1.",124717a6-589c-4721-98f9-5c11f9d541db
2,introduction2," In neurons transport is mediated through monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)216–18, in astrocytes through monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)419, 20. Recent studies reported a decrease or even loss of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2 expression in the micro vessels of patients and animal models with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)21–23. These changes in the cellular distribution of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)s suggest that clearance of brain lactate, as well as the uptake and release of KB, may be impaired in TLE. Contrary, it has been shown that KD can lead to an increase in monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 expression level in rat brain24, 25.  In the present study, we investigated the influence of KD on monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) transport activity using H+-imaging, and its influence on epileptiform activity using Ca2+-imaging.",4cb01388-0718-4bac-9c3d-7c4088bf53cb
3,introduction3," The experiments were performed in cortical astrocytes from mice fed either control or ketogenic diets (CD and KD). We observed that KD led to a robust increase in KB and lactate flux, mediated by increased monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 expression levels. Epileptiform activity was dramatically decreased in slices from mice following KD, but this effect was reversed by inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2. In contrast, inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2 in slices from mice following CD led to a decrease in epileptiform activity. Our results suggest that monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2 not only play an important role in the transport of KB under ketogenic conditions, but also in the modulation of lactate movement between astrocytes and neurons under normal and ketogenic conditions.

All cells considered for analysis responded to both stimuli (0 Mg2+/BIC and ATP or L-Glutamate). Ca2+ variations recorded were expressed as the relative fluorescence intensity (R.F.I (%) = (F/F0)*100). F is the intensity of the fluorescence emission recorded along the experiment, and F0 is the fluorescence intensity during the first 60 sec of the experiment. The noise was calculated over the first 60 sec of each measurement and the threshold was defined as two times the noise. Astrocytes were considered to respond to stimulations when the amplitude of the exhibited transients was higher than the threshold (indicated with * in the results). The frequency was calculated as the number of peaks during the time of stimulation (# of peaks/min).",08a00f2c-2769-4b24-aefb-6c5344cf559a

H+-imaging recordings were performed in CO2/HCO3 −-containing standard buffer. For preparation solutions containing KB or lactate, NaCl was replaced by an equivalent amount of sodium-L-lactate, DL-β-hydroxybutyric acid sodium salt and lithium acetoacetate, respectively. At the end of each measurement a pulse of CO2/HCO3 −-free standard buffer was applied. In this solution NaHCO3 was replaced by an equivalent amount of NaCl and aeration of CO2/O2 was stopped. The ratio of SNARF emissions (F < 590 nm/F > 590 nm) was calibrated using nigericin/30 mM K+ and converted into proton concentration (Fig. S5).

17,methods13," Statistical values are presented as means ± standard error of the average (S.E.M). For calculation of significance in differences, student’s t-test or, if possible, a paired t-test was used. Gaussian distribution of the data was assumed, since the number of cells considered in each experiment was always higher than 30, which is big enough to assume Gaussian distribution46. In the particular cases where the number of cells is unknown (like it was the case for western blot and mass spectrometry experiments) samples from at least three different animals were measured for each condition. In that case a Jarque-Bera test was performed to confirm normality of the data, which again allows assumption of normal distribution46.

19,results0,"Ketogenic diet decreases induced neuronal epileptiform activity in cortical slices Our main objective was to study the influence of KD on monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) transport activity during epileptiform activity. We considered two groups of mice and fed one group with a CD and the other one with a KD. The animals body weight and food intake were measured to ensure that both groups had the same conditions before brain cortex extraction.  For the first three weeks mice on KD had a significantly lower gain in body weight as mice on CD. However, after that time period both groups gained weight equally well and no significant differences in body weight could be observed during the time period where experiments were carried out (Fig. S1a). Food intake (F.I.) was also significantly less in mice on KD as compared to the group on CD during the first 1.5 weeks. However, the caloric consumption in both groups was comparable from that point on (Fig. S1b).",045ee1a0-3c3f-4105-82fa-8d3ad27c4f13
20,results1," Due to the initial differences in body weight and food intake, preparation of acute cortical slices was performed in mice at the age between 60 and 85 days (4 weeks in treatment).  To investigate the impact of epileptiform activity on slices from both dietary groups, we monitored intracellular Ca2+ changes in astrocytes in acute cortical slices from mice that followed CD and KD, by exposing the samples to Mg2+-free standard buffer, supplemented with 20 µM bicuculline (0 Mg2+/BIC) for 12 min (Fig. 1a,b). We used the frequency of Ca2+ transients in astrocytes as measure for neuronal activity. The frequency of the Ca2+ transients induced by 0 Mg2+/BIC in slices from mice following KD was significantly reduced compared to slices from animals fed with CD (Fig. 1c). This confirms that KD led to a reduction in epileptiform activity in cortical slices of adult mice.",07fbc26e-dd56-4ac7-81a6-67c5a070169f
21,results2," Furthermore, the frequency of Ca2+ transients evoked spontaneously were significantly smaller than the frequency of Ca2+ transients elicited by 0 Mg2+/BIC in slices from mice following CD and KD, which indicates that the Ca2+ transients evoked during 0 Mg2+/BIC application were indeed a result of induced epileptiform activity. There was no significant difference in the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ transients before application of 0 Mg2+/BIC between slices from mice following CD and KD.Figure 1 Epileptiform activity is reduced by the action of the ketogenic diet in cortical slices.

Indeed application of 0 Mg2+/BIC in the presence of The inhibitor AR C155858 tetrodotoxin citrate (TTX) did not result in a significant increase in astrocytic Ca2+ transients (Fig. 1e), which confirmed that the protocol used in the present study induced epileptiform activity by direct and exclusive action on neurons, which was further confirmed using the same protocol in pure astrocyte cultures, which showed no change in the frequency of Ca2+ transients (Fig. S2).

These concentrations were relatively close to the amount of BHB added to the medium during slices preparation (2 mM or 3.47 µg BHB/mg of tissue). These measurements indicate that BHB was almost entirely washed out of the slices from mice following KD after three hours of incubation in BHB-free saline.",2a56b0ac-7095-4e6a-a0bb-6f9c7ae354c4

Taken together the results indicate that KD dramatically decreases chemically-induced epileptiform activity in acute cortical slices. Additionally, acute removal of BHB from the medium does decrease, but not abolish, the dampening effect, induced by several weeks of KD, while short term exposure to BHB in slices from mice that followed CD did not reduce epileptiform activity.

29,results10," However, the observation that acute withdrawal of BHB reduces the dampening effect under KD, but acute application of BHB does not induce neuroprotection under CD, indicates that neuroprotection by KD is based on at least two mechanisms, one depending on the acute presence of BHB and one long-term effect that could not be induced by acute application of BHB.

44,discussion0,"KD has been largely used as an effective treatment for intractable epilepsy. However, the molecular mechanisms under which KD diminishes the incidence of seizures are still poorly understood. Nevertheless, some mechanisms of action have been suggested14, 15, including a potential role of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)s in the reduction of epileptiform activity during KD, as shown in the present study. Here, we unravel the influence of KD on monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) transport activity, and the role of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) in the decrease of epileptiform activity. Neuronal activity was assessed by measuring the frequency of astrocytic Ca2+ transients as previously shown31–34. We report that a KD dampens neuronal activity in brain cortex of adult mice during induced epileptiform activity. The frequency of Ca2+ transients during epileptiform activity is significantly reduced in cortical astrocytes from animals fed on KD.",bc7168ac-5ca1-4459-9d9b-875a8f76e456
45,discussion1," Contrary, removal of BHB from the medium several hours before the experiment partially reduced the neuroprotective effect induced with KD, but did not affect the frequency of Ca2+ transients in cortical astrocytes from mice on CD. This correlates with a reversion of the neuroprotective effect that has been observed in clinical models when KD is discontinued13, 29. BHB is one of the KB produced after fatty acids oxidation during KD, and it has been shown that BHB can directly interact with the Cl− binding site of VGLUT and thereby reduce synaptic glutamate release. Our mass spectrometry measurements showed that slices prepared in the absence of BHB contain almost no residual BHB. This suggests that the increase in epileptiform activity observed in the absence of BHB might be attributable to a reactivation of VGLUT after removal of BHB from the medium.",06848e99-8f45-4c91-855c-ca41bba0873f

47,discussion3," These results suggest that monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and/or monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2 are important in the uptake of KB, and indirectly in the reduction of epileptiform activity during KD, while the disruption of the astrocyte to neuron lactate shuttle (astrocyte to neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS)) by inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1/monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2 reduces epileptiform activity in control conditions. KD also increases proton-coupled transport of lactate and KB by an increase in the monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 expression level. monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 is the major isoform in cortical astrocytes in control and ketogenic conditions, as shown by the inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) transport activity with AR-C155858.

48,discussion4," Although monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)4 is reported to be expressed in the brain cortex of rats18, 35, the results presented here suggest very low or no expression of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)4 in the brain cortex of adult mice on CD or KD, since neither monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)4 protein nor physiological activity of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)4 were detected. This variation in monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)4 expression may be attributable to the difference in species and age of the animals36.  Based in the results obtained in the present study and considering that (1) glutamate release via VGLUT in neurons is reduced by action of KB37, (2) astrocytic glucose consumption is strongly inhibited by BHB38, (3) inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) suppresses seizures39, we propose a hypothetical model of the role of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)s during epileptiform activity in CD and KD (Fig. 8).",a1ebaebf-d784-4af3-a634-be605cb4e06f
49,discussion5," Under normal conditions, glucose supplies energy to neurons and astrocytes, which is transported through GLUT3 and GLUT1, respectively. In the astrocytes, glucose is converted to lactate via glycolysis, which is then extruded via monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and taken up by the neurons through monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2. Both fuels meet the increased neuronal energy demand, induced by epileptiform activity under normal conditions. Thus, ATP production is maintained and consequently hyperexcitability is prolonged, leading to an increased vesicular glutamate release, which is fuelled by VGLUTs. Glutamate in turn is sensed by mGluR in the astrocytes, triggering an increase in its cytosolic [Ca2+] (Fig. 8A1).",5d13ba72-55ac-4e9d-a3e0-e10571970bc9
50,discussion6," Under normal conditions, inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2 leads to a decrease in the epileptiform activity, mediated by a disruption of the astrocyte to neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS), which may lead to a reduction in the ATP production and consequently reduced glutamate release (Fig. 8A2). This idea agrees with a recent study39, in which the authors linked the inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to the suppression of seizures. Inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reduces ATP production, which activates KATP channels and in turn leads to a decrease in neuronal excitability40.Figure 8 Schematic model of the mechanism of action for monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)s during epileptiform activity in CD and KD.

51,discussion7," During epileptiform activity, neurons increase their energetic demand, which leads to an increase in the ATP production and glutamate release (A 1). When monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2 transport activity are inhibited by AR-C155858 (AR C155858 (ARC)), the astrocyte to neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) is disrupted, leading to a decrease in the ATP production, and consequently to a decrease in epileptiform activity (A 2). Under ketogenic conditions, KB concentration increases, leading to a reduction in the glycolytic rate in the astrocytes, which in turn reduces lactate and ATP production, in astrocytes and neurons, respectively. Neurons also take up KB, and now the availability of glucose increases for them. KB enter to the mitochondria and activate the TCA cycle, in addition, they modulate the glutamate release from VGLUTs, which leads to a dampening in the epileptiform activity (B 1).",c154628f-0d28-4f9c-80bf-f92fcd5a88c4
52,discussion8," Inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2 with AR-C155858 inhibits the uptake of KB and lactate via monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) in astrocytes and neurons. Epileptiform activity increases because KB cannot longer modulate VGLUTs, and due the conversion of the remaining lactate into pyruvate in the neurons (B 2). See more details in the text.     During ketogenic conditions, glucose and KB are available in the blood stream. Under these conditions monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 is up-regulated, which improves KB uptake into astrocytes and likely also in neurons. KB are efficiently metabolized in the astrocytic mitochondria, leading to a reduction in glucose uptake38 and consequently decreased production and export of lactate. For neurons, this results in decreased availability of lactate but increased availability of glucose, which is imported and metabolized in the glycolysis.",159f219d-0c61-4f50-a162-7a35ca484f42
53,discussion9," In addition, KB are taken up via monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2 into the neurons, where they directly activate the TCA cycle and suppress VGLUT activity by occupying the chloride-binding site37, leading to vesicles with less neurotransmitter and reduction of glutamate release (Fig. 8B1). Inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2 under ketogenic conditions leads to an increase in the epileptiform activity, which is primarily mediated by the blockage of KB uptake into neurons. In addition to this, we presume that a conversion of the remaining lactate to pyruvate in neurons might also contribute to the increase of epileptiform activity (Fig. 8B2).",943188c9-c96c-4cab-be39-aa449eaae458
54,discussion10,"  Taken together, our results indicate that inhibition of lactate uptake via monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1/monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2 into neurons leads to a substantial attenuation in seizures in the cortex from mice fed on CD, when lactate is the major fuel for neurons. This suggests that monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and/or monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2 in cortical neurons and astrocytes may be potential therapeutic targets for treatment of epilepsy. However, under ketogenic conditions, when glucose and KB are the primary energy sources of neurons, inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)2 leads to an increase in the epileptiform activity. This indicates that monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)s play different roles in neuroprotection under ketosis and under conventional diet. ",dccf0cb7-3a29-417d-93ed-187b8cd1165b
