2,methods2," Test Meals  The dietary interventions in this study used the following two diets and as well as the following two supplements. The subjects in the KD + placebo and KD + KF groups were provided a ketogenic diet based on a menu prepared by a registered dietitian. In addition, with each meal, the KD + KF group was provided a ketogenic formula (KF; Meiji Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and the KD + placebo group was provided a placebo formula. The ketogenic formula was a special infant formula with a high-fat, low-carbohydrate composition, which was formulated with medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and had a ketogenic ratio of 3:1, which has long been used in Japan for ketogenic dietary therapy for infants with congenital metabolic disorders and refractory epilepsy.

For medium-chain fatty acid concentrations (octanoic acid (C8), decanoic acid (C10), and dodecanoic acid (C12)), plasma samples were methyl esterificated using a Fatty Acid Methylation Kit (Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Methylated medium-chain fatty acids were quantified using GC-MS (SHIMADZU, Kyoto, Japan).  2.5.3. Other Measurement  For expiratory acetone measurement, a breath acetone-measuring device (NTT docomo, Tokyo, Japan) was used. Urinalysis tests included urinary protein, glucose, and urobilinogen.

14,methods14," Statistical Analyses  The main analysis was as follows: two-way analysis of variance (as follows two way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) was performed with the area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)) of plasma ketone body concentration per day on Day 1 and Day 4 as the objective variable, and groups (KD + KF and KD + placebo) and test days (Day 1, Day 4) were the explanatory variable. The secondary analysis was a two-way analysis of variance that was performed to evaluate the difference between groups and the difference between test days. This was done with area under the curve (AUC) and maximum values (Cmax) of plasma TKB, AcAc, BHB, medium-chain fatty acid, and BrAce concentrations per day as the objective variables. When a significant difference was observed by as follows two way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey–Kramer’s test was performed as a post hoc analysis.

15,methods15," Results  3.1. Participants  Twenty subjects were enrolled in this study. To calculate the sample size, the area under the curve (AUC) of plasma ketone body concentration after a single administration of the ketogenic formula was estimated, based on a previous study [14]. In this study, the required number of subjects was 6 in the placebo and ketogenic groups, assuming that the difference between the two observed groups in the single-dose study was maintained for 12.5 h and that there was no accumulation of ketone bodies due to continuous administration. Of the 20 subjects who participated in the screening, 16 subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to the 3 groups (Figure 2). In the baseline data, only albumin showed differences between groups, but there were no significant differences in the other background factors, such as height, weight, muscle mass, medical history, and blood data (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).",a60b7a60-715d-4e3f-b31c-f6a1c4830ed6
16,methods16," One subject in the KD + KF group had a dietary intake rate of 50% or less on two days, so he was excluded from analyses. In addition, the amount of activity during the test days showed a significant difference between the groups in terms of mean METs on Day 2; however, this was considered to be negligible because the mean difference was about 0.02 METs (Supplementary Table S3).  3.2. Primary Outcome  The daily area under the curve (AUC) of plasma TKB concentration was significantly increased from Day 1 to Day 4 in both the KD + KF and KD + placebo groups (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively) (Figure 3, Table 2). However, there was no significant difference between groups, and no interaction was detected between the group and the test day (data not shown).",320627b0-3b5c-44b6-9aae-043ca91e73c7
17,methods17,"  On the other hand, the diurnal variations in TKB concentration in the KD + KF group was larger than that in the KD + placebo group, and there was a statistically significant difference between the KD + KF and KD + placebo groups in terms of TKB concentrations after lunch and after dinner on Day 4 (Figure 4; p = 0.014 and p = 0.009, respectively).  3.3. Secondary Outcome  No significant changes due to dietary intervention were observed in the control group. In the KD + placebo and the KD + KF groups, the daily area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax of plasma AcAc, plasma BHB, and BreAce concentrations showed a significant increase from Day 1 to Day 4 (Table 3, Figure 5A–F). In comparison with the control group, the KD + placebo and KD + KF groups were significantly different in terms of daily area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax of plasma AcAc, plasma BHB, and BreAce concentrations at Day 4.",3f559140-3dec-4b23-83cf-cd805e2f9cce
18,methods18," However, there were no significant differences between the KD + placebo and the KD + KF groups for all secondary endpoints, except in the Cmax of BrAce (Figure 5; p = 0.007). The diurnal variation of plasma BHB concentration and BrAce showed similar tendencies in the KD + KF group and the KD + placebo group (Supplementary Figure S1).  The daily area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax of plasma octanoic and decanoic acid levels were already high at Day 1 and did not increase significantly from Day 1 to Day 4 in the KD + KF group (Table 3 and Figure 6A–F). In addition, significant differences between the KD + KF group and the other two groups were observed in the daily area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax of octanoic and decanoic acid in plasma (p < 0.01). The Cmax of dodecanoic acid in the KD + placebo group was significantly higher than that in the other two groups at Day 4.",3ec0153c-1bfb-4ac2-9e9f-aface3857355
19,methods19," There were no significant differences in the daily area under the curve (AUC) of plasma dodecanoic acid concentrations between groups, and no interactions were detected between the group and the test day (Supplementary Table S6).  The plasma octanoic and decanoic acid concentrations in the KD + KF group and the plasma dodecanoic acid concentration in the KD + placebo group remained significantly high (Figure 6). The main components of medium-chain triglycerides that were abundant in KF are octanoic and decanoic acids. On the other hand, the placebo formula did not contain medium chain triglycerides (MCT), but the triglycerides blended in the placebo formula contained a tiny amount of dodecanoic acid. These data were due to the dietary administration.  3.4. Safety Analysis  No adverse events were observed in the control group (Table 4). In the KD + KF group, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, and upper abdominal pain were observed in three, one, and one subjects, respectively (Table 4).",10b118b6-0f22-4ea8-b815-45ef6e082ea8
20,methods20," In the KD + placebo group, hyperuricemia was observed in three subjects. While a causal association with the test meal could not be ruled out, all were mild cases and recovered without treatment (Table 4). There was no significant difference in the number of adverse events between the KD + KF group and the KD + placebo group. Therefore, there were no safety problems, at least for short-term KF intake.  3.5. Physical Measurement and Vital Signs  In the KD + placebo group, body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat mass, right leg muscle mass, and left leg muscle mass decreased significantly from Day 1 to Day 5 (Supplementary Table S4). In the KD + KF group, body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat mass, muscle mass, left arm muscle mass, trunk muscle mass, and right leg muscle mass were significantly reduced. In the control group, body weight and body mass index (BMI) were significantly reduced. However, no differences were observed between the physical parameters of the groups.",9eb70924-8ff3-4daf-a6f4-25ca1113fc32
21,methods21," Therefore, the loss of muscle mass and body weight were likely due to confinement for a certain period of time and the decrease in food intake. Although a significant decrease in muscle mass was observed in the KD + placebo and KD + KF groups, the average decrease was about 3%, suggesting that safety concerns were minimal. However, periodic monitoring of body composition, including muscle mass is required for long-term intake of KF. On the other hand, the average body fat mass of the KD + placebo group and the KD + KF group decreased by about 5% or more, so the ketogenic diet has the potential to lead to weight loss (Supplementary Table S4).  There were no significant differences in the vital signs among the three groups, and vital signs varied within the normal range during the test days for all groups (Supplementary Table S5). In other words, these changes were likely due to captured physiological diurnal variations, and it was considered that there was no particular safety problem.",c9eab41d-22ae-4d1a-97b2-d5c424fab7a4
22,methods22,"  3.6. Muscle Strength  From the screening day to Day 5, knee strength was significantly increased in the KD + placebo group, and right toe strength was significantly increased in the KD + KF group. However, no differences were observed between the groups in terms of muscle strength. Therefore, there was no particular safety problem regarding muscle strength. It seems contradictory that muscle strength increased even though muscle mass decreased; however, subjects were likely to apply greater strength during the measurement on Day 5 because of the learning effect on the measurement of the muscle strength (Supplementary Table S6).  3.7. Blood Parameters  In the KD + placebo group, PLT (p = 0.029), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (p = 0.014), triglycerides (TG) HDL cholesterol LDL cholesterol albumin (ALB) transthyretin (TTR) (p = 0.002), blood glucose (p = 0.005), and IRI (p = 0.008) decreased significantly, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (p = 0.022), UA (p < 0.001), and IRG (p = 0.",2c54b4d2-35ff-4518-aa25-457ee0c1b1bf

In the KD + KF group, triglycerides (TG) HDL cholesterol LDL cholesterol albumin (ALB) transthyretin (TTR) (p = 0.007), blood glucose (p = 0.006), and IRI (p = 0.011) were significantly decreased, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (p < 0.001) and UA (p = 0.002) were significantly increased. In the control group, only IRI (p = 0.046) was significantly increased. On Day 5, UA (p < 0.001), TG (p = 0.004), triglycerides (TG) HDL cholesterol LDL cholesterol albumin (ALB) transthyretin (TTR) (p = 0.007), blood glucose (p < 0.001), and IRI (p < 0.001) showed significant differences between the groups. From these results, it was determined that a ketogenic diet increases UA and TG, decreases triglycerides (TG) HDL cholesterol LDL cholesterol albumin (ALB) transthyretin (TTR), which is an indicator for albumin (ALB) synthesis, and decreases blood glucose and IRI levels.  3.8.",2a5b5e59-d7c2-423e-b680-a3fa868cdab9
24,methods24," Urinalysis  No remarkable changes were observed for urine protein, urobilinogen, and other urinalyses during the test days. Therefore, no safety problems due to the ingestion of the test meals were detected regarding urinalysis.  3.9. Metabolic Parameters  There was a significant difference between the groups in the mean blood glucose levels determined using continuous blood glucose monitoring (p = 0.009). However, the time ratio below the reference value (70 mg/dL) showed no differences between groups (p = 0.799). The average blood glucose levels of the KD + placebo and KD + KF groups were lower than those of the control group because they ingested ketogenic diets, but this did not lead to an increase in hypoglycemic time. Moreover, the proportion of hypoglycemia in the KD + KF group was the lowest among the groups. Therefore, a ketogenic diet using KF was shown to decrease, but not to significantly fluctuate, blood glucose levels (Table 6).  3.10.",c86f3196-deb7-4e80-8b4e-baf623f70a38
25,methods25," Gut Microbiota  As a result of comparing the amount of change in the gut microbiota, six genera showed significant differences between groups (Lactococcus, Clostridiaceae 02d06, Clostridium, Veillonella, Eubacterium, Fusobacterium) (p < 0.05, Figure 7).  The similarity in the composition of gut microbiota was calculated as the Aitchison distance. The day of fecal sampling did not significantly affect the Aitchison distance in any groups (KD + placebo: R2 = 0.069, p = 0.788, KD + KF: R2 = 0.059, p = 0.908, control: R2 = 0.072, p = 1.000). These results indicated that the dissimilarity in gut microbiota was influenced by the individual differences at the same time points, which were greater than the differences between the time points within the same individual. The effect of the ketogenic diet on microbiota was shown to be not be large enough to change bacterial composition across the differences among the individuals or groups (Supplementary Figure S2).",146b157c-eafe-447e-9158-7baeed4139b0
26,methods26," Diversity (Shannon index) tended to increase in the KD + placebo and KD + KF groups (Supplementary Figure S3). In addition, the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (FB) ratio, which has been suggested to be associated with obesity [15,16], tended to show a decrease in the phylum Firmicutes, though only in the KD + KF group (Supplementary Figure S4).  4. Discussion  The ketogenic diet requires a rigorous limitation of carbohydrates while allowing a liberal ingestion of fats (including saturated fats) and has generated intense medical debate. Clinical studies on ketogenic diets show promise for a variety of clinical indications; however, they often do not utilize consistent and standardized diets or compliance measures in order to enable the reproducibility and generalizability of study outcomes [17,18].",8f66103e-32a8-4e36-b683-17e2369caca2
27,methods27," The current consensus is that the ketogenic diet is a potentially safe and powerful therapeutic intervention; however, it should be assessed on an individual basis, keeping in mind safety recommendations [18,19]. In overweight/obese individuals, it is a promising option to achieve a significant weight loss in a short period of time [20]. There is no clear evidence for advantages of ketogenic diets regarding cardiometabolic risk markers, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [19,21]. There is currently conflicting evidence of the utility of a ketogenic diet in cancer therapy. It might be argued that the ketogenic diet, in combination with standard therapies, has the potential to enhance the antitumor effects of classic chemo- and radiotherapy, with an overall good safety and tolerability, as well as an increase in quality of life [22].",93d59b09-1b11-454c-917c-3ac9211a7c9f
28,methods28," However, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials revealed inadequate evidence to support the beneficial effects of a ketogenic diet in antitumor therapy [23]. Moreover, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, and upper abdominal pain have been observed in previous studies with cancer patients [11,22,23]. Therefore, this was likely an adverse event that occurs when a ketogenic diet is administered. On the other hand, a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet could be beneficial to increase the quality of life, physical performance, body composition, and metabolic health of breast cancer patients [24], and it is well tolerated by glioblastoma patients [25]. To further elucidate the mechanisms of the ketogenic diet as a therapy, and to evaluate its application in clinical practice, more studies, as well as uniformly controlled clinical trials, are strongly needed.",be2331c4-57c2-440b-acf6-40b2bf71e337
29,methods29,"  In our double-blinded, randomized, parallel-group comparative study, the usefulness of standardized multiple doses of KF in ketone-body induction was examined. Compared with the KD + placebo group, the diurnal variation of total ketone bodies was significantly increased in the KD + KF group after lunch and after dinner on the 4th day. Although the sample size was limited, these results show that it might be necessary to focus on diurnal variation rather than daily area under the curve (AUC) in order to evaluate the effects of KF on plasma TKB concentrations. Similar results were obtained for plasma AcAc and BHB concentrations. AcAc and BHB are robust readouts of KF administration, and supply of these exogenous ketone bodies and ketone sources can even be considered a complement to, or an alternative to, the ketogenic diet itself [26].",d3470591-81c9-4cbe-a6f1-7e8a21ce8062
30,methods30," It has been previously shown that ketonuria in subjects with stable ketosis is highest and can be most reliably detected in urine at certain times of the day, such as post-dinner [27], which is consistent with our findings. This can provide recommendations regarding the precise time of the day for measuring ketone bodies. We suggest that KF may be useful for inducing the peak of ketone bodies. Since it has been reported that induction of ketone bodies affects clock genes [28], it is possible that the difference between the peak value and the trough value of ketone bodies may affect the long-term prognosis of cancer patients. In the KD + KF group, the maximum value of BrAce was significantly higher than that in the KD + placebo group. This may indicate that the induction of ketone bodies by medium-chain fatty acids (octanoic and decanoic) is different from the induction of ketone bodies by long-chain fatty acids, or even by another medium-chain fatty acid (dodecanoic).",9679a61e-f184-464b-9872-a95ac30e97c2
31,methods31,"  In addition, triglycerides (TG) HDL cholesterol LDL cholesterol albumin (ALB) transthyretin (TTR) decreased and blood glucose and IRI levels decreased in both the KD + KF and the KD + placebo groups; however, IRG did not show a significant increase in the KD + KF group, and, even in continuous blood glucose monitoring, the proportion of hypoglycemia in the KD + KF group was the lowest among the three groups. Hence, the effect of KF on glucose metabolism may be different from that of the placebo. These questions will need to be examined through further metabolomic analyses. Considering energy metabolism, a study on the effects of 20 days of ketogenic diet on metabolic and respiratory parameters in healthy subjects uncovered that a ketogenic diet, overall, decreased rest energy expenditure, decreased carbon dioxide body stores, and there was a higher percentage of fat loss versus a standard Mediterranean diet [29].",7187f5fc-569f-45b1-9db4-80553fca5567
32,methods32," We observed that the KD + KF group displayed a paradoxical increase in muscle strength, although muscle mass was decreased, which might be dependent on the type of muscle analyzed [30].  In the KD + KF group, three subjects experienced mild hyperuricemia, one subject showed hyperlipidemia, and one subject presented with upper abdominal pain. However, all cases recovered without treatment according to subsequent follow up. These are possible adverse events when a ketogenic diet is ingested, which we previously observed in past clinical trials [11,14]. In addition, there was no major difference in the number of adverse events for which a causal association cannot be ruled out in the KD + KF and KD + placebo groups. These results suggest there are no safety issues related to KF intake.  Ketogenic diets can have a dramatic impact on human microbiota in a very distinct manner compared to a high-fat diet.",2f66243c-4b39-498d-982d-df7402662439
33,methods33," In vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that ketone bodies selectively inhibited bifidobacterial growth [31]. Moreover, ketogenic diet-associated gut microbiota reduced the levels of intestinal pro-inflammatory Th17 cells [31]. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota could be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, which can be relieved by a ketogenic diet [32]. Other human and animal studies have shown controversial effects in reshaping bacterial architecture and gut biological functions, such as a lowered diversity and an increased amount of pro-inflammatory bacteria [33]. Although further analysis is needed to investigate a correlation between certain bacterial species and blood parameters, such as that done in a previous study [34], KF did not significantly influence gut microbiota composition, suggesting a neutral and safe effect.",da419c3d-fa0f-49bf-b870-e35d5bc7e931
34,methods34,"  The main limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size and the short term of the study period, which might not have clearly revealed the effects of KF on several metabolic pathways and on gut microbiota composition. Moreover, another limitation is that the subjects in this study were not elderly people. In clinical practice, it is very important to reveal the effects of a ketogenic diet on geriatric syndromes. A larger amount of baseline data from elderly subjects is needed to accumulate information about the effects of the ketogenic diet and the formulations of ketogenic diet regimens. In our pilot human study, we reported that multiple doses of a ketogenic diet incorporating KF displays metabolic and biochemical safety and tolerability. This information might be useful to standardize and to safely practice ketogenic diets in clinical applications, such as for cancer therapy. ",b56b88fc-2092-41b6-b519-3d64b589630e
