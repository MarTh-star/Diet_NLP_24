0,background0,"Periods of intentional fasting are practised worldwide, usually for traditional, cultural, or religious reasons. Fasting is defined as the partial or total cessation of food intake for a specific period. There is ample empirical and observational evidence that medically supervised modified fasting lasting one to 3 weeks is effective in the treatment of several chronic and acute diseases, eg, rheumatism, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome [1]. Recent animal experiments revealed that short-term fasting (short term fasting (STF)) prior to high-dose chemotherapy decreases chemotherapy-induced toxicities dramatically without weakening the therapeutic effect [2]. Acute chemotherapy-induced toxicities can trigger to premature discontinuation and dose reductions in chemotherapy, and both are risk factors for poorer therapeutic outcome.",2ddcde5e-59e3-4248-b4da-36928bc279bc
1,background1," Adjuvant metabolic nutritional therapies during cancer treatment such as short term fasting (STF) or a ketogenic diet (KD) have recently been discussed and promoted in major newspapers, telecasts, and online, making it a popular topic.  In 2012, Safdie et al. [3] demonstrated that fasting for 48 h sensitised murine, rat, and human glioma cells, but not primary mixed glia cells, to chemotherapy. In the same year, Lee et al. [4] demonstrated that treatment under fasting conditions sensitised 15 of 17 mammalian cancer cell lines to chemotherapeutic agents and was as effective as chemotherapeutic agents in delaying the progression of different tumours. In neuroblastoma mouse models, fasting cycles plus chemotherapy drugs - but not either treatment alone - resulted in long-term cancer-free survival [3]. A recent article by Brandhorst et al.",8c54edd0-eee0-49bf-b144-df5c23182eca
2,background2," [2] described stress resistance in mice fed either an ad libitum standard diet or macronutrient-defined dietary restriction for 3 days or 60 h fasting prior to high-dose doxorubicin treatment. In contrast to the ad libitum-fed mice, the great majority of fasting (60 h) mice survived to day 25 after chemotherapy (16% vs. 89%) and exhibited no visible signs of stress or pain, like reduced mobility, ruffled hair, and hunched-back posture. Raffaghello et al. [5] showed similar results, namely that fasting for 48–60 h before etoposide treatment enhance resistance in mice.  Fasting induces wide-ranging changes in metabolic pathways and cellular processes, including decreases in circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and glucose. This affects different oncogenes including RAS and the AKT-signalling pathway, and leads to downregulation of proliferation and cell growth [6].",947eb0cb-7a28-4265-8244-d7a39e4874e1
3,background3," Cell culture experiments showed that healthy cells are protected from treatment toxicity, while tumour cells become more vulnerable to chemotherapy during short-term fasting. This phenomenon is described as differential stress resistance. Normal cells enter an alternate state characterised by reduced or a lack of cell division and resistance to multiple stresses, upregulation of DNA repair and induced autophagy. Tumour cells are unable to activate a protective response, and growth pathways remain persistently overactivated. Tumour cells are thus more sensitive to chemotherapy [4–7].  In a case series report published in 2012 [8], patients who fasted voluntarily during chemotherapy proved the feasibility and safety of various fasting regimens and reported significantly fewer chemotherapy-induced side effects, including asthenia, fatigue and gastrointestinal problems such as vomiting and diarrhoea.",ccef342f-7c78-408b-8be4-63d285918603
4,background4," In the patients whose cancer progression could be followed, there was no evidence that fasting protected tumours or interfered with chemotherapeutic potency. De Groot et al. [9] published the first randomised controlled pilot trial evaluating short term fasting (STF)’s feasibility and effects on tolerance of adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients (N = 13), demonstrating that a 48 h fasting period during chemotherapy was well tolerated and reduced both bone marrow toxicity and chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononucleated cells. Bauersfeld et al. [10] found that short term fasting (STF) during chemotherapy was safe and well tolerated, and seemed to improve quality of life and fatigue in a pilot trial with 34 gynaecological cancer patients. Dorff et al.",5ced6763-ad7c-47dd-a75e-afe813342063
5,background5," [11] published their results of a dose-escalation fasting-study in 2016 where 20 patients with advanced cancer undergoing platinum-based combination chemotherapy fasted for 24, 48 and 72 h during chemotherapy administration, and found that fasting for 72 h was safe and feasible for cancer patients and that fasting-related toxicities were limited to ≤grade 2. Subjects who fasted for 48 h or longer revealed less DNA damage in leukocytes and IGF-1 levels decreased in all fasting cohorts.  Michalsen et al. [12] demonstrated in a non-randomised trial with 209 patients suffering from chronic pain, that short term fasting (STF) has no serious side effects.. Typical complaints reported in the initial fasting period at a level that did not interfere with daily activities include hunger, tiredness, irritability, headache, and light-headedness [8, 12, 13]. Fasting-related discomfort occurred especially on fasting days 2 and 3, when metabolism moves to physiological ketosis [13].",a5c6cd7e-8f65-4ed7-a3ab-5aef4acf4e02
6,background6," Fasting leads to strong neuroendocrine adaptations that resemble the metabolic responses to a KD [14]. A KD involves the intake of a high-fat, adequate-protein and very low- carbohydrate regimen (< 30–40 g/day), and induces a metabolic condition called “physiological ketosis”, namely the state of elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood [15]. Previous studies revealed that ketosis exerts a hunger-suppression effect, although its mechanisms of action on reducing appetite are not yet completely understood [16–18]. We conducted this pilot study to evaluate the influence of 96 h-fasting on chemotherapy-induced toxicities in patients with gynaecological cancer. Furthermore, quality of life, fatigue, fasting-related discomfort, compliance, nutritional status and laboratory values are assessed.",99568008-21c1-432c-9550-45c74e99e6a8
7,background7, We are the first to have investigated whether a KD as a fasting supportive diet can reduce fasting-related discomfort during the first days and increase patient’scompliance with our fasting regimen. ,03c575e2-e1e6-4d7b-a224-55cbcbc67e08

Study design and intervention This pilot study had an interventional, open-label cross-over design entailing a dietary intervention. Its primary objective was to evaluate the influence of modified short-term fasting (mshort term fasting (STF)) on chemotherapy-induced toxicities in gynaecologic cancer patients on the basis of the probability of adverse events grade III and higher. The dietary intervention consisted of an mshort term fasting (STF) or a 6-day normocaloric KD prior to each mshort term fasting (STF). Patients were selectively assigned to one of the four study groups: A, B, C, D (Fig. 1). All study groups included 2–3 periods of mshort term fasting (STF) or mshort term fasting (STF) combined with KD and normocaloric diet (NC), respectively.",c25bc274-a5e6-4890-b4e4-d339cc687361
10,methods2," Patients in study groups A und C started with mshort term fasting (STF) or KD prior to mshort term fasting (STF) for the first half of chemotherapy cycles, whereas groups B and D began with NC. For statistical analysis we mainly compared NC cycles to mshort term fasting (STF) cycles. Furthermore, we compared cycles of mshort term fasting (STF) versus cycles of mshort term fasting (STF) combined with KD. All patients entered the preparation period after randomisation, which consisted of individually teaching units and the development of an individual diet plan for the 4 day- mshort term fasting (STF) period by a skilled nutritional scientist. One day before each dietary intervention period, patients received a reminder by phone or email. In periods between the dietary interventions close to the chemotherapy cycles, patients were on their usual NC. Fig.",b0378faa-76db-4c84-9ca6-a1f6c61a6986
11,methods3," 1 Crossover study design to test the effect of modified short-term fasting (mshort term fasting (STF)) during 2 or 3 cycles of chemotherapy (chemotherapy (CTX)) depending on chemotherapy (CTX) regimen on chemotherapy (CTX)-induced toxicities compared to a normocaloric diet (NC) during 2 or 3 cycles of chemotherapy (CTX) as control and to test the effect of a normocaloric ketogenic diet (KD) followed by mshort term fasting (STF) on fasting realated discomfort compared to mshort term fasting (STF) alone    During mshort term fasting (STF), the level of caloric restriction was limited to 25% of each patient’s daily calorie requirement, consisting of the resting energy expenditure multiplied by a factor that corresponds to the individual overall physical activity level. The resting energy expenditure was estimated with the improved Harris-Benedict equation [19]. The energy content of the mshort term fasting (STF) for most patients was between 400 and 600 kcal/day.",b091563c-e660-478b-b545-53c776b1e07d
12,methods4," The mshort term fasting (STF) was an individually adapted, very low-calorie diet whose macronutrients revealed to a ketogenic composition (75% fat, 15% protein and 10% carbohydrates) aiming to support the metabolic changes in fasting and to minimise the burden of water-only fasting. The patients were instructed to drink a daily minimum of 2.5 L of any calorie-free liquids, including water, herbal tea, and diet drinks without stimulants such as caffeine and alcohol. The fasting period took place on 5 consecutive days lasting a total of just 4 days (96 h). According to the hypothesis of the differential stress resistance, the greatest protecting effects of fasting are expected when patients are in a state of ketosis. Usually, patients enter the phase of ketosis after 2 or 3 days of fasting. A fasting duration of 96 h was chosen to ensure that the metabolism of all patients has adjusted to fasting and that patients are in the state of ketosis at the time of chemotherapy administration.",c9bcfa1a-8dd2-4e78-a448-3ac484f62b66
13,methods5," Mshort term fasting (STF) started 3 days prior to chemotherapy in the evening at 6 pm. The fasting period ended 1 day after chemotherapy at 6 pm, approximately 24 h after the end of drug administration to extend beyond the half-life of most toxic drugs [20].  While patients in study groups A and B received only a mshort term fasting (STF), patients in study groups C and D additionally obtained a 6-day normocaloric KD prior to each mshort term fasting (STF) period. Both fasting and normocaloric KD lead to similar metabolic changes [21] including a state of ketosis which can suppress hunger [16–18]. Accordingly, fasting metabolism was induced via a KD before each 4-day mshort term fasting (STF) period. The patients in study groups C and D received advice and recipes to follow a KD ad libitum according to their own food preferences. The patients were encouraged to limit their carbohydrate intake to a maximum of 20–40 g/day and to derive at least 75% of total consumed energy from fat.",6b034db8-d5be-4058-b4d3-67bf71d0489d
14,methods6," The macronutrient content during KD was the same as during the mshort term fasting (STF) period except for the energy content.  Outcome assessment Our outcome measures were determined at baseline, at each chemotherapy cycle and as follow-up 3 weeks after the 4th or 6th cycle depending on the chemotherapy regimen. To determine the main endpoint, we assessed the percentage of patients with grade III or higher chemotherapy-induced toxicities. Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0) [22]. This comprehensive toxicity grading scale is well established and used in clinical practice. Toxicities were reported by grade (level of severity) on a scale of I to V, whereby grade V (death) is inappropriate for some adverse events.",56758143-64d3-41f1-8327-87250c3ed709
15,methods7," Further outcome measures included chemotherapy-induced toxicities grade I/II (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0), nutritional status, body composition via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA, Body Impedance Analyser Nutriguard-MS™, Data Input GmbH, Germany), and validated questionnaires issued by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)) and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)) focussing on quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 [23]), chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-CIPN20 [24]) and fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue v4.0 [25]).",4f9259b9-ac10-43e8-84db-f93c1dc4a87e
16,methods8," In addition to the chemotherapy-induced toxicities (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0), a self-reporting questionnaire was developed especially for this trial to evaluate the chemotherapy-induced side effects in the week following chemotherapy. The patients rated their toxicities daily on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Venous blood sample were drawn before each chemotherapy administration and analysed at the Institute for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Medical Centre Freiburg. The fasting effect was determined by recording hematologic parameters (differential blood count), inflammatory response [C Reaktive Protein (CRP)], metabolic parameters [insulin, IGF-1] and endocrine parameters [thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4)].",0693fd49-9320-4adc-99b1-a9ae02e411b1
17,methods9,"  Our safety measures relied on recommendations published 2013 by the Expert Panel Update of the 2002 Consensus Guidelines for Fasting Therapy [26]; they include laboratory values of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium), renal (creatinine, urea nitrogen, uric acid) and liver function (bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], and gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT]). To document compliance with the mshort term fasting (STF) regimen and verify that the control group was not fasting, patients were obliged to record their daily food intake and to monitor their ketosis state by documenting daily measures of urinary ketones via self-testing strips (Ketostix®, Bayer AG, Switzerland) during each fasting cycle. Blood ketone levels were also checked at each chemotherapy via a testing device called FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System with blood β-ketone test strips (Abbott GmbH & Co.",7218c316-23df-4689-9162-57672031e369

At the follow-up visit, a specially developed questionnaire was distributed to evaluate the patients’ subjective feelings and the feasibility of this pilot study.  Sample size calculation and statistics As this is a pilot trial, no precise sample size calculation could be made. However, the following considerations regarding its usefulness may justify the choice of 40 patients in a cross-over design with 2 groups (NC vs. mshort term fasting (STF) or mshort term fasting (STF) + KD) and a binary outcome: probability of adverse events grade III or higher. We assume a probability for grade 3 or higher adverse events of 0.60 (data source: GOIM 9902 study [27]) with NC and of 0.30 with fasting, i.e. a difference in proportions of 0.30.",aae74618-799f-425e-b95a-29e3987277a1
19,methods11," We further assume that the proportion of patients with differing results between NC and mshort term fasting (STF) or mshort term fasting (STF) + KD would be 0.40 (discordant pairs). A sample size of 30 pairs would have 80% power to detect a difference in proportions of 0.30 when the proportion of discordant pairs is expected to be 0.40 and the method of analysis is a McNemar’s test of equality of paired proportions with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. Taking into account the possibility of dropouts, we would have needed 40 patients to ensure sufficient power.  All variables were tested for normal distribution (Kolmogorow-Smirnow test). Normally distributed variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation and compared using two sample t-test for differences between intervention groups or paired t-tests for differences between baseline (T0) and follow-up (FU).

20,methods12," The Mann-Whitney test was used for independent groups, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for paired groups.  Our primary objective was to evaluate the influence of modified short-term fasting (mshort term fasting (STF)) on chemotherapy-induced toxicities based on the probability of adverse events grade III and higher. Unexpectedly, we observed only a very low incidence of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade ≥ III during the study period, thus we decided to analyse the probability of toxicities grade I or II as binary variable. Additionally, we analysed the probability of self-reported adverse events as continuous variable on the basis of a point scoring system.

Only one patient declared mshort term fasting (STF) to be “difficult”, while 11 rated it as “quite difficult”. Mshort term fasting (STF) was evaluated as “quite easy” or “easy” by 9 patients, respectively. In total, more than half the patients would fast again during chemotherapy (n = 24).

34,discussion0,"The primary objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of a 4-day mshort term fasting (STF) with a ketogenic macronutrient composition on chemotherapy-induced toxicities Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade III and higher in patients with gynaecological cancers. Secondary objectives were the assessment of toxicities Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) I/II, self-reported toxicities, body composition, blood parameters and subjective well-being (QoL, CIPN and fatigue). This is the first clinical trial to explore the effects of a 6-day normocaloric KD prior mshort term fasting (STF) as a fasting supportive diet on fasting-related discomfort and compliance.  We were surprised to have observed only a very low incidence of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade ≥ III during the study period, which meant we were unable to assess our primary endpoint.",1bead7c4-e664-4deb-92e0-64f95c7a9f01
35,discussion1," We did, however, find that mshort term fasting (STF) improved patient’s tolerability of chemotherapy thanks to fewer chemotherapy-induced toxicities such as less stomatitis, fewer headaches, less weakness and overall toxicities. In agreement with previous studies, these outcomes confirm that mshort term fasting (STF) during chemotherapy is safe and well tolerated [8, 11]. Our findings differed between Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and self-reported toxicities, which may be attributable to the different time points of the queries. Coolbrandt et al. [28] demonstrated that delayed self-assessments of chemotherapy-induced toxicities from retrospective queries as in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), provide a distorted, less accurate overview of patient’s actual symptoms and experienced symptom severity than immediate self-reports.",3df23d42-a9e2-46bc-8212-8587b4e28dcc
36,discussion2," Hence, we assume that prospective self-reported toxicities reflect the genuine side effects better than the retrospective Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Considering previous human fasting studies during chemotherapy, note that there are major differences among study populations, designs, types, and durations of fasting interventions. It is thus not surprising that findings on chemotherapy-induced toxicities vary from trial to trial. While Safdie et al. [8] and Dorff et al. [11] detected fewer gastrointestinal toxicities, including less nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after short term fasting (STF), we observed no differences in these symptoms. This can probably be explained by the fact that our patients tended to report very few cases of gastrointestinal toxicity during both mshort term fasting (STF) and NC cycles, due to each patient’s individually-adapted preventive concomitant medication against nausea and vomiting. Safdie et al. [8] and Bauersfeld et al.",f5878521-5c39-4608-ab8c-0855e63b4b51
37,discussion3," [10] reported significant reduced fatigue after short term fasting (STF).. However, in line with Safdie et al. [8], our trial patients reported significant less weakness in the week after mshort term fasting (STF), indicating that mshort term fasting (STF) could promote regeneration after chemotherapy. Unexpectedly, patients experienced significant fewer headaches during mshort term fasting (STF), even though fasting and irregular meals are among the frequent triggers for migraine [29]. However, there is some evidence that ketones reduce the frequency and severity of migraine and headaches presumably via improved mitochondrial function and less oxidative stress [30–32]. It is well known that many serious chemotherapy-induced side effects compromise the continuation of therapy, leading to its postponement or interruption.",ec946792-0985-4c15-bbc6-d32871976a1d
38,discussion4," Overall, the reduced toxicities due to mshort term fasting (STF) in this trial probably resulted in faster physical regeneration after chemotherapy and demonstrably fewer chemotherapy postponements.  Animal studies investigating short term fasting (STF) during chemotherapy have demonstrated that short term fasting (STF) leads to less damages and faster regeneration in bone marrow cells and resulting cells, especially leukocytes [33]. Safdie et al. [8] confirmed these observations in their first case series report, indicating that especially leukocytes, thrombocytes and neutrophils reveal faster regeneration due to short term fasting (STF) during chemotherapy. De Groot et al. [9] observed significantly increased erythrocytes and thrombocytes, and Dorff et al. [11] detected less neutropenia and thrombocytopenia,concluding that short term fasting (STF) protects against depletion and DNA damage to leukocytes.",5e5f6e68-400f-4e3f-98cf-fc446b92e5a0
39,discussion5," Contrary to previous studies, we identified no significant changes in any of the above-mentioned blood parameters, which is probably attributable to our small study population. However, we observed significant reductions in MCH and MCV during mshort term fasting (STF). These blood parameters are considered to be independent prediction parameters of survival in various cancers prior to surgery [34]. In case of breast cancer patients, higher MCH levels suggest adverse effects on disease-free survival [35]. Although reduced MCH and MCV values can be considered positive results, the clinical relevance of these findings remain unclear, particularly in view of this pilot trial’s small patient cohort.  We measured significantly increased ketone body concentrations during mshort term fasting (STF), which proves that patients were fasting-compliant. This finding is consistent with the result of Dorff et al. [11]. While both de Groot et al. [9] and Dorff et al.",67986eef-0956-4ccb-bd9a-3e0f8d4e43e4
40,discussion6," [11] observed only a slight trend towardlower insulin levels during short term fasting (STF) cycles, we detected a significant insulin reduction. Similarly to de Groot et al. [9], we detected a significant reduction in IGF-1 during mshort term fasting (STF). This reduced IGF-1 seems to be one of the key mediators of differential stress resistance in response to nutrient restriction [36]. Previous experimental data indicate that it is mainly low IGF-1 levels that induce differential stress resistance, leading healthy cells to be protected from chemotherapy’s toxicity, and mediated by the downregulation of cell growth and proliferation, while tumour cells are unable to activate a protective response [4, 5, 37]. Since we observed both reductions in IGF-1 and chemotherapy-induced toxicities, our results support the hypothesis that reducing IGF-1 promotes differential stress resistance.",6dff4421-e267-4a28-a657-2897923241b0
41,discussion7," Blood glucose levels should be measured in future trials to obtain deeperunderstanding how ketones, insulin, and IGF-1 fluctuate. The increase in endocrine parameter fT4we observed is in line with the results of the human-fasting intervention trial by de Groot et al. [9], and our earlier clinical trial that, investigated the effect of a normocaloric six-week KD on biochemical parameters in healthy adults [38]. While de Groot et al. [9] revealed no change in fT3, we identified a significant reduction in fT3 during KD in the aforementioned trial in healthy subjects [38]. We observed comparable changes in thyroid hormones in a clinical trial with a normocaloric KD and in this trial with mshort term fasting (STF). This can probably be attributed to the state of physiological ketosis, which appears in both mshort term fasting (STF) and KD due to carbohydrate restriction.",e92af070-340b-4fcd-8d55-d4c949d248df
42,discussion8," The change in the fasting safety parameters sodium and uric acid during mshort term fasting (STF) has been demonstrated in fasting studies with healthy adults [13, 39]. Fasting is known to provoke dehydrating effects, including the enhanced excretion of minerals, especially sodium. Enhanced natriuresis during initial fasting days is accompanied by the excretion of ketones via urine, which is always accompanied by cations, namely initially by sodium, followed by ammonium [40, 41]. The increased uric-acid concentration during fasting is due to reduced renal uric acid clearance via impaired tubular uric acid secretion because ketone bodies compete with uric acid for shared tubular secretion [41, 42].  Consistent with previous fasting studies in healthy adults, we observed a mild weight loss (< 5%) during mshort term fasting (STF), which remained until the end of our examination [13, 39].",5c5cd6f2-16d2-4683-963a-e25bdce93aa9
43,discussion9," In contrast, previous animal and human trials investigating fasting during chemotherapy showed that animals and humans regained their usual weight after an initial weight loss [3–5, 8, 10, 11, 43]. In this respect, note in particular that the documented weight loss in our trial is primarily attributable to lost fat mass, whereas lean body mass remained stable. Compared to water-only fasting, mshort term fasting (STF) allowed a slight caloric intake per each fasting day to minimise protein catabolism, including the loss of lean body mass [44]. Given that lost lean body mass is associated with impaired nutritional status and poor general condition, it should be avoided by all means [45, 46]. Although weight loss proved ultimately harmless in our trial, fasting accompanying chemotherapy may only be implemented if the risk of malnutrition can be excluded.  Indeed, this is the first human fasting intervention study to have assessed body composition during fasting via BIA measurements.",3fd5d3d3-1871-4976-8dc0-e7ef530d41ec
44,discussion10," We thereby observed significant reductions in body cell mass and phase angle over the trial’s course. Generally speaking, phase angle is an independent prognostic factor for impaired functional and nutritional status and overall survival [47, 48]. Reductions in the phase angle during cancer treatment can frequently be explained by chemotherapy-induced damages, because cytostatic drugs reduce total cell amount and membrane integrity [47, 49]. Notably, phase angles were already below reference values for healthy women stratified by age and body mass index (BMI) at the beginning of our study [50]. An adjusted reference value (more precisely, the fifth percentile of the phase angle reference value) is commonly used especially for oncological patients [48, 51]. Nevertheless, the phase angle was slightly below the adjusted reference value at the end of our trial. No published clinical trial to date has investigated fasting’s impact on the phase angle.",7a6f740e-9704-48cd-9631-82abf71a8aea
45,discussion11," Moreover, it remains unclear whether fasting affects body composition,, especially the phase angle.  Similarly to Bauersfeld et al. [10], we collected data on QoL, fatigue and additionally CIPN. While Bauersfeld et al. [10] observed significant improvements in fatigue and QoL due to short term fasting (STF) during chemotherapy, our results fail to confirm their findings. However, note, that the informative value of the three afore mentioned questionnaires is limited due to an unfavourable point in time for collecting data on the day of chemotherapy, reflecting QoL, CIPN and fatigue in the week before chemotherapy. No valid conclusions can be drawn from our results concerning the impact of fasting on QoL, CIPN, and fatigue in the week following chemotherapy.",f799002c-ada6-4df9-bf6e-1744ca4d0521
46,discussion12,"  Since both mshort term fasting (STF) and KD trigger similar metabolic changes, including a state of ketosis that can suppress hunger [16–18], we hypothesized that a KD as a fasting supportive diet prior to mshort term fasting (STF) would improve compliance with the fasting regimen and reduce initial fasting-related discomfort. However, we detected no beneficial effects in conjunction with a 6-day normocaloric KD prior to mshort term fasting (STF) compared to mshort term fasting (STF) alone by relying on compliance, fasting-related discomfort, chemotherapy-induced toxicities and other outcome parameters in this trial. On the contrary, patients consuming a KD prior to mshort term fasting (STF) found the feasibility of this intervention to be harder than did patients consuming an mshort term fasting (STF) alone. Therefore, a KD prior to mshort term fasting (STF) seemed to be an additional burden to patients undergoing chemotherapy, providing neither benefit nor advantage.",d46e8a52-9fb2-400e-bf0c-8f06222d0cd4
47,discussion13,"  Our study had some limitations. The most obvious is our small sample size within the scope of the pilot trial, which limits our study’s power and precludes firm statistical conclusions. The high dropout rate in our pilot trial limits the power of the conclusion. Several patients dropped out because of an additional and excessive burden of the study intervention or without giving reasons before the beginning of the intervention. Not all cancer patients are sufficiently motivated and resilient to rise to the challenge of fasting during chemotherapy. Thus, further fasting studies have to pay great attention to the recruitment and better informing of study participants. Although cross-over models are restricted by carry-over effects, we chose this design for our pilot trial because of the low influence of confounding variables in control and intervention groups and the high statistical efficiency associated with small sample sizes.",84f1163e-4c58-4092-9302-4c74cc7c84ae
48,discussion14," In our pilot trial, carry-over effects can be neglected because with the end of fasting and return to normocaloric diet the metabolism changes very quickly from hunger metabolism to food intake metabolism. Therefore, washout period of 3 weeks is sufficient. Another limitation is due to missing randomisation. The randomisation was initially planned but due to the outpatient chemotherapy ward’s strictly-set daily routine, it was impossible for us to conduct the randomisation as planned. Consequently, patients were not randomly but selectively assigned to our four study groups. Additionally, we failed to document concomitant medication during chemotherapy in our pilot trial. Finally, it is possible that patients subjectively overestimated fasting’s positive effects due to their knowledge of the allocated interventions and the generally positive attitude toward fasting cures in Germany.",b1f8f770-7caa-43bc-9015-bf028c8c678d
49,discussion15," This limitation can only be resolved by a double-blinded randomised study design, which is not possible with natural nutrition.  Conclusion In summary, our results reveal that mshort term fasting (STF) is safe and feasible for gynaecologic cancer patients, however, this intervention requires high motivation. Moreover, mshort term fasting (STF) during chemotherapy has the potential to reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicities and improve the tolerance of chemotherapy. Different blood parameters and metabolic parameters, particularly IGF-1 and insulin, were positively influenced by mshort term fasting (STF). A 6-day normocaloric KD prior to mshort term fasting (STF) revealed no beneficial effects on either chemotherapy-induced toxicities or fasting-related discomfort and compliance. Clearly, there is a need for larger randomised controlled trials focussing on confirming the efficacy of mshort term fasting (STF) accompanying chemotherapy as an innovative, supportive approach.",e864addb-4522-42d7-b912-6fbddd8da027
