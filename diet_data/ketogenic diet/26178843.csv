0,introduction0," Cancer metabolism is an attractive target in tumors, especially those that are largely resistant against radio- and chemotherapy. As tumor cells rely more on anaerobic glycolysis compared with non-tumor cells, which is called the Warburg effect, glycolysis inhibitors were tested in cancer therapy [1]. Unfortunately, although this strategy has been pursued for many years and many different compounds are available now, there is only a very limited amount of clinical trials testing glycolysis inhibitors and, to our knowledge, no inhibitor has been approved for cancer therapy yet [2].  Similarly, life style factors which could influence cancer metabolism have for many years been the focus of epidemiologic studies [3–6], and indeed the influence of eating habits and physical exercise (PE) on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is well known.",b89cbdbf-ec3e-437b-9006-a296fd15da5f
1,introduction1," Interest is growing in deciphering the impact of these factors on both the prevalence of different cancer types, as well as their significance in cancer therapy. PE has been shown to have beneficial effects in primary and secondary prevention of breast and colon cancer [7–11] and may also reduce cancer-related fatigue [12, 13].  Life style factors – such as caloric restriction and PE - may influence cancer therapy by several mechanisms, including changing the levels of growth factors (such as insulin-like growth factors), sex hormone profiles, reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), and inflammatory responses [14–18]. Pedersen et al. recently demonstrated that PE in mice on its own reduced tumor growth through epinephrine- and IL6 dependent NK cell redistribution into tumor tissue [19].  Interestingly, Rafaghello et al.",c61794c1-5405-4d7c-8c02-63867923c24d
2,introduction2," showed that low-glucose or low-serum media protected primary glial cells, but not glioma and neuroblastoma cell lines against toxic levels of oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide or cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. They translated their in vitro work into an in vivo model demonstrating that a starvation period of 48 h reduced toxicity of cyclophosphamide- and etoposide-chemotherapy in starved mice allowing the use of higher dosages of chemotherapy, which resulted in longer survival of neuroblastoma bearing mice. This process was named differential stress response (differential stress response (DSR)), which they suggest occurs due to the lower resistance of tumor cells to altering levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with healthy cells [20]. Woolf et al.",3086478e-4030-40cc-a77e-1097fe74cccc
3,introduction3," give an interesting overview about the metabolic changes induced by ketogenic diet which improve survival in animal models of malignant gliomas and can potentiate the anti-tumor effect of chemotherapies and radiation treatment [21]. Although, the ketogenic diet on its own did not show anti-glioma activity in a small clinical trial [22].  Here, we focused on the beneficial effects of PE as an isolated and adjuvant treatment strategy in glioblastoma (GB) therapy. GB has an average overall survival of less than 2 years despite maximal safe resection, concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (temozolomide (TMZ)) followed by adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ)-therapy [23].  We were interested to test whether PE is suitable to induce a differential stress response (DSR) protecting non-tumor cells from temozolomide (TMZ) induced toxicity and would thus allow applying higher doses of temozolomide (TMZ).",50b6f89d-eb20-4f57-bb88-e236df3a88f3
4,introduction4," We chose a forced exercise model with treadmill (TM) training over voluntary free-wheel activity. It has been demonstrated that this approach was more effective in inducing the molecular correlates of physical exercise, both in the muscle but also in the brain, where elevated levels of the mitochondrial complexes I and V as well as the anti-oxidative enzyme Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) were detected [24, 25].  Given that PE's mode of action might include induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we sought to model this in vitro using the anti-malarial drug dihydroartemisinin (dihydroartemisinin (DHA)), which has been shown to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) in leukemia cells and thereby induce anti-oxidative enzymes [26]. Artesunate which is metabolized to dihydroartemisinin (DHA) was suggested to be used in the treatment for recurrent glioma in a cocktail with eight other drugs [27, 28].",63ed9668-b8c0-44cf-8a7e-1224d7eae1cf
5,introduction5,"  Given the limited preclinical data about dihydroartemisinin (DHA), this approved anti-malarial drug might be a potentially interesting agent when combined with temozolomide (TMZ) or radiotherapy in glioma therapy. It was demonstrated that dihydroartemisinin (DHA) increased temozolomide (TMZ)-toxicity in C6 rat glioma cells in vitro in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism [29]. Moreover, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is supposed to induce autophagy, to reduce invasivity of glioma cells and to target glioma stem cells [30–32]. dihydroartemisinin (DHA) could therefore be an interesting agent in the treatment of GB sharing in part the mechanism of action with PE by inducing oxidative stress pharmacologically.

6,methods0," Cell culture The primary GB cell line T269 was established from freshly dissected GB tissue from adult patients after informed consent and cultured as described before [42, 53]. Cells were seeded in neural sphere cell medium (neural sphere cell medium (NSCM)) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium: F12 medium enriched with B27 supplement, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (20 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (epidermal growth factor (EGF)) (20 ng/mL), and leukemia inhibitory factor (20 ng/ml). To propagate cells in culture they were split mechanically. The human glioma cell lines LN-Z308, T98G and LN-229 (ATCC, Manassas, USA) were kept in complete medium composed of Dulbecco‘s modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, High glucose, 4,5 g/l, PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.",4e1eadce-f593-442c-ab52-5b374c1df011

Concentrations are detailed in the figures.  Clonogenicity Clonogenic capacity was assessed by limiting dilution assay (limiting dilution assay (LDA)) [54]. Shortly, cells were dissociated with accutase. Afterwards, 96-well microwell plates were plated with 300, 50, 8, and 1 cells in 0.2 mL of neural sphere cell medium (NSCM) or complete medium. After 3 weeks, microwell plates were analyzed for wells showing clones and clonal frequency as well as the level of significance were calculated with L-Calc free online software (STEMCELL Technologies, Cologne, Germany). Stem cell frequency was expressed by 1 divided by the minimum amount of cells necessary to form a colony.",f601a08a-a127-4781-a2d4-dcc3a9c6b400
8,methods2," To evaluate temozolomide (TMZ) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) effects limiting dilution assay (LDA) was also performed during treatment with these drugs in the indicated doses. temozolomide (TMZ) and n-acetyl cysteine were administered once at the day of plating, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) was given three times, at the day of plating as well as after 24 and 48 hours.  Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) Total RNA was extracted using a RNA purification system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and treated with RNase-free DNase I to remove genomic DNA (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). cDNA was prepared from 5 μg of total RNA using the Superscript RNase H–Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and random hexamers (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). For qRT-PCR, gene expression was measured in an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with SYBR Green Master Mix (Eurogentec, Cologne, Germany) and primers at optimized concentrations [42].",e55032f8-49d0-4a71-970c-4e0033e2e08f

13,methods7,"  Flow cytometry Cells were analyzed in a BD-FACS Canto II flow cytometer, final data were processed with the help of FlowJo flow cytometry analysis software (Treestar) [42]. To access reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels cells were stained with H2DCFDA (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA) after a 72 h treatment course with dihydroartemisinin (DHA) 5 μM or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as control.  Proliferation LN-Z308 and LN-229 cells at 2500 cells/well and T269 at 5000 cells/well were dissociated and plated in quadruplicates in 96- well plates in 200 μl volumes of medium. temozolomide (TMZ) and n-acetyl cysteine were administered once at the day of plating, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) was given three times, at the day of plating as well as after 24 and 48 hours. After 72 h, cells were pulsed for 24 h with [methyl-3H]thymidine (0.5 lCi), harvested (Tomtec, Hamden, CT, USA), and incorporated radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland) [55].",968c4a7f-1f79-46f6-a719-0b9be3f4bbec
14,methods8,"  Animal experiments All animal work was performed in accordance with the German animal protection law (Approving institution: Regierungspraesidium; Karlsruhe; animal proposal: 35-9185.81/G-99/08 G). Tumors were induced injecting 1×105 T269 or LN-Z308 cells suspended in phosphate buffered saline (phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) orthotopically into the right striatum of 6–12 weeks old athymic female mice (CD1 nu/nu, Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) by a stereotactic procedure. In the first experiment with T269 cells 8 animals were implanted per group. Six were used for Kaplan-Meier analysis, 2 animals for histological examinations. In the second experiment with LN-Z308 cells, 4 animals were implanted per group, of which 3 were used for analysis of tumor size by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  To reduce pain, animals were anesthetized with xylazine and ketamine. Neurological symptoms were assessed daily.",e61e39f1-257c-4080-bcba-2c6450e4fe49
15,methods9," Symptomatic animals were rapidly sacrificed and brains were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. Cryostat transverse brain sections (8 μm) were stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) or with anti-human Nestin antibody (Chemicon International, Billerica, USA) on a Ventana Benchmark Immunostainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, USA) and analyzed by AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).  To evaluate the influence of PE and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) alone and in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) in vivo, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) (0,9 mg/kg bodyweight) was administered subcutaneously after preparation of a dihydroartemisinin (DHA) stock solution containing 2.25 mg dihydroartemisinin (DHA), 10 μl TWEEN 80, 1g NaCO3 and 20 ml distillated water for four days of every chemotherapy cycle as established for malaria therapy in rodents [56]. temozolomide (TMZ) was administered in a 0.5% methylcellulose solution in 0.9% NaCl by oral gavage.",3635ba20-1b87-40d2-81b1-c7bbf42332f4
16,methods10," PE was performed for 45 min on 5 days per week with a moderate intensity of up to 18 m/min with an incline of the treadmill of 5°. The first week of exercises speed was continuously increased until the animals were used to it. If animals were too exhausted due to therapy or tumor growth to keep up with the speed of 18 m/min it was lowered. The slowest speed mice ran was 16 m/min for 40 min. The details of the first mouse experiment with T269 cells are provided in Figure 2a. In the second experiment with LN-Z308 cells all temozolomide (TMZ) cycles were administered at 21 mg/kg bodyweight. This dose was systematically established as shown in Supplementary Figure S1.  Blood samples for the measurement of chemotherapy toxicity were taken from the submandibular vein, a maximum of 140 μl/25g bodyweight were collected. Tumor volumes were determined via T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) after intraperitoneal injection of gadolinium-DTPA.",143358f0-b9f0-4860-b721-dcf3e8063e12

21,results0," PE slows down tumor growth but does not induce a differential stress response To test the effects of PE in the context of GB chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ), mice were habituated to daily moderate endurance training on a treadmill. Mice were trained at a speed of 18 meters per minute for 45 minutes at 5 of 7 days per week reflecting a moderate intensity which corresponds to 50-75% of the maximum oxygen consumption as shown before in a mastocytoma mouse model in vivo [33]. The treadmill and the incline as well as the detailed study protocol are illustrated in Figure 1a. temozolomide (TMZ) was administered in a dose-intensified scheme of 7 days on and 7 days off for 2.5 cycles 10 days after the primary GB cell line T269 had been orthotopically implanted in nude mice.",2d2b1bb6-f9f9-4d12-aaee-aded445d211f
22,results1," To address whether PE can induce a differential stress response with a higher resistance of the hematopoietic cells against temozolomide (TMZ)-toxicity, the temozolomide (TMZ) concentration was doubled in the second week of chemotherapy to 84 mg/kg.

Only animals treated with PE combined with temozolomide (TMZ) showed a significant benefit when compared with untreated animals (* p<0.05).  dihydroartemisinin (DHA), known to induce oxidative stress, which could be one possible mechanism PE might act through, was given four days per week to imitate regular endurance training.",c8deff78-06da-45b6-a6a2-0a275c00a21e
23,results2,"  Blood counts and body weight were monitored to address hematopoietic toxicity and tolerance to treatment. Dose escalation of temozolomide (TMZ) to 84 mg/kg showed toxic effects on the hematopoietic system with a severe reduction of the platelet and leucocyte counts in the temozolomide (TMZ)-treated groups. PE and the administration of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) did not induce a differential stress response with a reduced hematotoxicity. This was also true for body weight as a more general critical parameter for well-being. All animals treated at 84 mg/kg temozolomide (TMZ) in the second week of chemotherapy suffered from loss of body weight, which did not occur in the untreated or PE-only-treated animals (Figure 1b).  Only PE combined with temozolomide (TMZ) showed a significant survival benefit when compared with untreated animals in a pairwise analysis.",bcfece94-c2ed-47cb-a71b-9172c1e19967
24,results3," The combined analysis of all the treatment subgroups did not show a significant treatment benefit in any subgroup with a p-value of 0.06 in the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test. As T269 primary glioma cells form very invasive tumors (Figure 2 upper raw), we were interested to see whether infiltration was reduced by the combination of temozolomide (TMZ) and PE or dihydroartemisinin (DHA) compared with single temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. Untreated or only PE treated animals showed the largest tumors at the end of the treatment period which invaded into the contralateral hemisphere passing the corpus callosum (Figure 2 upper raw). After temozolomide (TMZ)-monotherapy, invasion of T269 tumor cells was massively reduced without detectable tumor cells in the corpus callosum and the contralateral hemisphere which impeded the detection of a further anti-invasive effect in the combined treated mice (Figure 2 middle and lower raw).",dde3e13d-11e9-4a74-81b8-52924b83db18

To further evaluate the effects of PE on tumor growth, a second mouse experiment was conducted with the GB cell line LN-Z308, which allows monitoring of tumor growth with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because this cell line forms more bulky, non-invasive tumors.",cfbafc91-ac30-4510-98d7-629ace47925f
26,results5," The temozolomide (TMZ) dose was reduced to 21 mg/kg as LN-Z308 cells proved to be more sensitive in vitro compared with T269 cells (Supplementary Figure S1). Although T269 cells have an unmethylated MGMT-promoter status [34] suggesting that they might have a higher resistance against temozolomide (TMZ)-treatment [35], they do not express MGMT protein and show an intermediate temozolomide (TMZ)-sensitivity in vitro compared with the highly resistant MGMT-unmethylated T98G and the sensitive methylated LN-Z308 cells (Supplementary Figure S1).  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which was performed during the last chemotherapy week with temozolomide (TMZ), demonstrated that the addition of PE or dihydroartemisinin (DHA) to temozolomide (TMZ) resulted in smaller tumors compared with untreated or temozolomide (TMZ)-only-treated animals.",63fb0885-e16b-49a6-b744-d7c86f49abbf
27,results6," temozolomide (TMZ) alone reduced tumor size to ~ 55% while the additional use of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) or PE resulted in a tumor size of less than 20% compared with untreated animals (Figure 3).  Figure 3 Combination therapy of either PE or dihydroartemisinin (DHA) administered with temozolomide (TMZ) is more effective than temozolomide (TMZ)-monotherapy against LN-Z308 derived tumors in mice MR images and the statistical evaluation thereof demonstrate that in vivo the combined treatment of temozolomide (TMZ) and either dihydroartemisinin (DHA) or PE is more effective than temozolomide (TMZ) alone in treating a LN-Z308 derived orthotopically xenotransplanted GB.  Effects of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) on human glioma cells in vitro PE may act in many different ways on tumor tissue such as e.g. altering levels of blood glucose, ketone bodies, sex hormones and insulin, as well as stimulating the immune system [14–19].",699690b4-3cec-43ea-bf7f-10188f37952e

In LN-Z308 cells, N acetyl cysteine (NAC) at 5 mM could partly antagonize the anti-clonogenic effect of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) used at the higher 9μM-dose illustrating that dihydroartemisinin (DHA) acts in part via the induction of oxidative stress. A single treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) at 10 mM was less anti-clonogenic than even the lower dose of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) monotherapy.  The combination of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) at 9μM and temozolomide (TMZ) 10μM was more anti-clonogenic in LN-229 and T269 cells compared with the monotherapies (Figure 4b) arguing for a synergistic therapeutic effect.",9d7f5faa-c067-4c11-8e02-5aa48aab30e4
33,results12,"  As the rescue-experiments with N acetyl cysteine (NAC) could only give a hint that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in the mode of action of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) we evaluated the mRNA-levels of enzymes antagonizing products of oxidative stress. The mRNA-expression of catalase (catalase (CAT)), superoxide dismutase (superoxide dismutase (SOD)) 1 and 2, glutathione peroxidase (glutathione peroxidase (GPX)) 1 and 4 as well as pyridoxine reductase 2 (pyridoxine reductase 2 (PRX)) were measured by qPCR in LN-229 cells, human astrocytes and T269. As a general marker of cellular stress we measured C/EBP homologous protein (C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)) mRNA in qPCR and performed flow cytometric analysis with the fluorescent oxidative stress marker H2DCFDA in LN-229 cells after treatment with 5μM dihydroartemisinin (DHA).  H2DCFDA showed an increased fluorescence after treatment with dihydroartemisinin (DHA) at 5 μM (Figure 4c).",f203a938-30f2-4914-bdf7-02c96a25bde3
34,results13," dihydroartemisinin (DHA) at 9 μM induced cellular stress measured by a ~6-30x induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in the tested cells.  Anti-oxidative enzymes were up-regulated on the mRNA-level for more than twofold exclusively in T269 primary glioma cells but not in human astrocytes or LN-229 cells. In detail, T269 cells showed upregulation of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX)1+4 and superoxide dismutase (SOD)2 (Figure 4c) after treatment with dihydroartemisinin (DHA) at 9 μM.  Moreover, as dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is supposed to act via autophagy [37], we addressed if it could induce autophagy in LN-229, T269 and LN-Z308 cells by measuring the protein levels of the early marker of autophagy, LC3 BII, in western blot (Figure 4d). Here, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) was able to induce autophagy in all the cell lines tested as assessed by the higher levels of LC3 BII.",e2fd1edb-6aea-4234-8c10-ec5e067b4a3f
35,results14,"  We further addressed phospho-p90RSK, phospho-Akt, phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) and phospho-S6 ribosomal protein levels in temozolomide (TMZ) only or in temozolomide (TMZ) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) treated cells to analyze whether these oncogenic pathways, which are in part responsible for resistance against temozolomide (TMZ) therapy [38], are differentially induced by the combined versus the single agent treatment. dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and temozolomide (TMZ) did not reduce any of the above-mentioned phospho-protein levels compared with temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy. On the contrary, at least one phospho-protein was more activated in the different cell lines tested when comparing the combined therapy with the temozolomide (TMZ)-monotherapy. temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy did not show an activation of the examined pathways compared with control treatment in these short lasting 72 hour in vitro experiments (Supplementary Figure S2).",99eabc87-1d15-488c-987b-1ad5a0e31e3b
36,results15,"  Interestingly, the protein level of phospho-NDRG1, another gene responsible for temozolomide (TMZ)-resistance [39], which was upregulated in all the cell lines tested after a single course of temozolomide (TMZ)-chemotherapy, showed a reduction in the combined dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and temozolomide (TMZ) treatment compared with temozolomide (TMZ)-monotherapy (Figure 4e).  Finally, we examined the protein levels of the stem cell markers sox2 and nestin in the primary glioblastoma cell line T269 after dihydroartemisinin (DHA) treatment to assess whether dihydroartemisinin (DHA) can induce differentiation. Both markers were clearly reduced after dihydroartemisinin (DHA) treatment (Figure 4f).  ",19b8b0b1-046b-4efc-a156-00fbb1c2b056
37,discussion0," It has been observed that PE has positive effects in the primary and secondary prevention of breast and colon cancer, and that exercise is a strong independent predictor of survival in malignant recurrent glioma [5]. Clinical trials demonstrate that PE is feasible for heavily treated cancer patients and the adherence to PE e.g. in cancer patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation was with 66% (inpatients) to nearly 80% (outpatients) high [40, 41]. We therefore set out to assess whether the addition of PE to standard temozolomide (TMZ) treatment regime prolongs survival of glioblastoma bearing mice. We chose an orthotopic xenotransplanted tumor model of GB derived from the primary glioma-initiating cell-line (glioma initiating cell line (GIC)) T269 [42].",29cb6369-e144-454a-b93d-30430f101569
38,discussion1," glioma initiating cell line (GIC)-lines have two significant advantages when modelling tumors: they better reflect the invasive growth pattern of human gliomas than do tumors derived from GB cell lines cultured in serum containing medium [43], and they may also be enriched in cancer stem cells which are thought to be responsible for therapy resistance and recurrence [44].  We found that while moderate PE by itself did not influence the survival of tumor-bearing CD1 nu/nu mice, in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) it appeared to prolong the survival of mice. Although this only reached statistical significance when comparing temozolomide (TMZ)+PE mice to untreated animals, we feel this is a particularly robust result given the small group sizes in this experiment (exacerbated by drop outs during repeated oral gavage and training).",b8f160c1-7d57-4e3c-8d87-f0ac8be00ff9
39,discussion2," This is reinforced by the observation that the temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy group (the current standard therapy for GB) was itself not significantly different from the untreated group. Furthermore, differences between the treatment groups might have been masked by a very strong temozolomide (TMZ) effect in some animals, which required the termination of the experiment after 220 days (Figure 1b).  This strong effect of temozolomide (TMZ) might be explained by the dosing strategy, in that we utilized the dosing scheme established before in other mouse experiments [45, 46], in a dose-dense regimen (7 days on/7 days off) resulting in a cumulative temozolomide (TMZ) dose of ~ 1g/kg over 3 weeks. During the escalated dose phase this was sufficient to test whether PE might induce a differential stress response (DSR), as mice clearly demonstrated signs of toxicity (Figure 1).",85c71eec-bb6b-4c92-b094-646977a6c46b
40,discussion3," However, the 1g/kg total dose would, in an average person weighing 75 kg and 180 cm tall, equate to a total dose of 75 g – far above the ~18 g a patient would receive over a standard 6 month therapy (6 cycles over 6 months with a daily temozolomide (TMZ) dose of 200 mg/m2 body surface on 5 of 28 days per cycle, including the concomitant treatment during irradiation). Although one must demonstrate caution when making inferences between data from mouse models and the human situation, given that we utilized human GB cells, the amount temozolomide (TMZ) might have been too high to detect any additional benefits of its combination with PE or dihydroartemisinin (DHA) (in addition to the limitations of group size discussed above).",48f3baaa-273c-4cd0-8d71-6a94b667fb4b
41,discussion4," This would also hold true when analyzing invasiveness of T269 derived tumors, where again the efficacy of the temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy in causing a massive decline of invasiveness (Figure 2) precluded the identification of any additional anti-invasive effects of PE and/or dihydroartemisinin (DHA).  We sought to determine if PE might induce an acute differential stress response (DSR), in much the same way as has been demonstrated for starvation [20], where non-tumor cells become resistant to otherwise toxic doses of chemotherapy. Such a mechanism would allow the use of higher doses of chemotherapy. However we found that all groups receiving temozolomide (TMZ) at the escalated dose of 84 mg/kg bodyweight clearly demonstrated severe signs of intoxication with a loss of bodyweight and marked pancytopenia.",c02c8109-5cdb-4235-8fcf-ef890a20f02f
42,discussion5," This was by itself an unexpected result given previous publications suggesting that nude mice can tolerate up to 300 mg/m2 of temozolomide (TMZ), which corresponds to 100 mg/kg [47]. Intriguingly, the drop in body weight following temozolomide (TMZ) therapy was less pronounced in the group with PE (Figure 1).  Given the difficulties of resolving any combinatorial effects of temozolomide (TMZ) and PE or dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in the first mouse experiment, we performed a further experiment utilizing LN-Z308 cells, which form non-invasive bulky tumors which can be analyzed using contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare treatment efficacy.",f702468e-e1de-407b-9946-d3026490a694
43,discussion6," We first performed a preliminary experiment (Supplementary Figure S1) to determine the relative sensitivity of LN-Z308 cells towards temozolomide (TMZ) compared with T269 cells; although neither line expresses MGMT at the protein level (a key resistance factor to temozolomide (TMZ) treatment) [35], LN-Z308 are about 4 times as sensitive as T269 (as shown by comparing temozolomide (TMZ) dosages required to induce a similar effect on G2-arrest). We therefore lowered the dosage of temozolomide (TMZ) to 21 mg/kg to maintain a similar effective toxicity for the tumor cells.  Encouragingly, this model did show significantly smaller tumors after a combination treatment of temozolomide (TMZ) and PE or dihydroartemisinin (DHA) when compared with temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (Figure 3).",d847f0e9-c579-4692-be7a-8be1b1bb18a8
44,discussion7," For this second experiment we did not perform the temozolomide (TMZ)+dihydroartemisinin (DHA)+PE regimen as this proved to be less effective than temozolomide (TMZ) combined with PE or dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in the Kaplan-Meier analysis of the first animal experiment, probably due to accumulated toxicity.  We hypothesized that PE might mediate its effects in part through the induction of oxidative stress. As PE cannot be reproduced in vitro, we mimicked its potential effects pharmacologically using dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a known inducer of oxidative stress [29, 48, 49]. We confirmed that dihydroartemisinin (DHA) treatment resulted in up-regulation of the mRNA-levels of anti-oxidative enzymes, especially in the primary T269 glioma initiating cell line (GIC)s (Figure 4b).",331b7648-3f07-48e4-98bc-993bc873128c
45,discussion8," Furthermore, preclinical in vitro data exist demonstrating various anti-glioma effects of dihydroartemisinin (DHA), with evidence suggesting that dihydroartemisinin (DHA) treatment can also induce autophagy, exert an anti-invasive effect, and target stem cells in glioma [30–32]. Xu et al. showed that more than 80 proteins linked to the cytotoxicity of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in prostate cancer cells are differentially expressed in proteomic analysis including aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and metabolic pathways as well as heat shock protein HSP70 underlining the complex mode of action of this agent.  Using clinically relevant doses of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) we confirmed a dose dependent induction of the early autophagy marker LC3 BII (Figure 4d) in both the glioma lines LN-229 and LN-Z308, as well as the on primary glioma line T269.",1595a5ed-0eef-42f9-b197-156fa6b681f3
46,discussion9,"  We then tested the anti-glioma properties of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in our cell models, and observed a dose dependent anti-clonogenic and anti-proliferative effect in all three lines. These effects were in part reversible by the administration of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenger compound N acetyl cysteine (NAC), implying dihydroartemisinin (DHA) might act through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism. The combination of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) with temozolomide (TMZ) showed synergistic anti-clonogenic and anti-proliferative action, confirming similar observations obtained using C6-rat glioma cells in vitro [29]. Many conflicting data exist on the induction of authophagy to sensitize glioma cells to temozolomide (TMZ) showing that probably mild autophagy will enhance resistance while a stronger induction will lead to a higher sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) [50, 51].",6ca202a7-b5e0-475f-b6fa-3ffb24e40d6e
47,discussion10," As our data showed a very robust induction of autophagy in the combined treatment of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and temozolomide (TMZ) as well as synergistic anti-glioma activity, we believe that autophagy induced by dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is beneficial in the treatment of GB. However, the definite role of autophagy in the combined treatment of temozolomide (TMZ) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) would only be deciphered by blocking autophagy e.g. by silencing components of the autophagy pathway.  As recent studies suggest that temozolomide (TMZ) can significantly increase driver mutations in recurrent glioma, particularly in the retinoblastoma and Akt-mTOR pathways [38], we examined the activity of these pathways by measuring the phospho-protein levels of p90RSK, Akt, p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) and S6 ribosomal protein.",c7710d6e-d9b7-4a6b-b0d3-4353b3bf746f
48,discussion11," As the combined treatment of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and temozolomide (TMZ) did not reduce the activity of the afore mentioned pathways in 72 hour in vitro experiments, this is unlikely to represent dihydroartemisinin (DHA)'s therapeutic mechanism in our in vitro experiments (Supplementary Figure S2).  Instead, we observed that protein levels of phospho-NDRG1, which rise after temozolomide (TMZ) treatment and predict resistance against temozolomide (TMZ) [39], were decreased by combining dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and temozolomide (TMZ) treatment (Figure 4e). To conclude, the inhibition of p-NDRG1 by dihydroartemisinin (DHA) as well as dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) represent two possible mechansims how dihydroartemisinin (DHA) might overcome therapy-induced resistance in gliomas [52].",0f407648-9f0b-4434-9a88-543b28263251
49,discussion12," Moreover, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) exerted a differentiating effect on T269 cells leading to a down-regulation of the stem cell markers Sox2 and nestin which argues again for its use in the combination with temozolomide (TMZ) to better target glioma stem cells.  To summarize, we could show that PE has an additive effect when combined with temozolomide (TMZ) in the treatment of GB-bearing mice. Our escalating dosing scheme showed that PE does not mediate a differential stress response (DSR) as shown before for starvation.  Given that many patients have difficulty in performing PE during treatment, we focused our efforts on mimicking the PE mediated induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [24, 25] using the anti-malarial drug dihydroartemisinin (DHA). dihydroartemisinin (DHA) showed anti-glioma effects in vivo in mice.",4f89c075-4bdd-4dfe-acb8-fdfcf7392def
50,discussion13," We were able to confirm previously reported anti-proliferative, anti-clonogenic and stem cell targeting effects of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in in vitro models (including two different glioma cell lines and primary T269 glioma initiating cell line (GIC)).  As dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is an approved drug which additionally suppresses temozolomide (TMZ)–induced activation of phospho-NDRG1, a known mechanism of resistance, our data builds on previous results to warrant initiating clinical trials combining temozolomide (TMZ) with dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in the treatment of glioma patients.  Finally, for those patients able to perform PE, we believe various PE training paradigms should be evaluated in mice to develop an ideal protocol (balancing high versus low intensity training, or endurance versus resistance training), possibly including a specialized diet.",b8be7fa3-cbf9-48ea-8d9b-f190080e9791
51,discussion14, Such a protocol could be translated into clinical trials to improve the treatment of glioma patients with a minimum risk of negative side effects.  ,c5d67b52-7c73-451c-81bd-d599d849831a
