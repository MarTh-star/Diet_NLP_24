Energy deficits can lead to disruption of ion gradients, which can trigger neuronal depolarization and generation of seizures. Thus, perturbed metabolic processing of glucose in epileptogenic brain areas indicates a specific nutritional need for people and animals with epilepsy, as they are likely to benefit from auxiliary brain fuels other than glucose. Ketogenic diets provide the ketone bodies acetoacetate and β‐hydroxybutyrate, which can be used as auxiliary fuel by the brain.

This means there is inadequate seizure control despite being treated with two or more appropriately chosen ASDs.1, 2 In addition, many ASDs have side effects. Thus, there is an urgent need for new treatments.  Here, we review the existing knowledge about impairments in energy metabolism in epileptogenic brain areas in animal models, and dogs and humans with epilepsy. We summarize the anticonvulsant effects of medium chain triglycerides (Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s) and medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) in rodents, dogs, and humans and then discuss proposed anticonvulsant mechanisms.  2 ENERGY METABOLISM IN EPILEPSY  2.1 Glucose transport and cytosolic metabolism  Normally, in a fed state, glucose is the primary energy source of the brain.

5,abstract5,"3, 4 In the cytosol, glucose is broken down by glycolysis to generate two pyruvate, two adenosine triphosphate (adenosine triphosphate (ATP)), and two nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)) molecules. When pyruvate enters mitochondria and subsequently the tricarboxylic acid (tricarboxylic acid (TCA)) cycle, it can produce a net total of one adenosine triphosphate (ATP), one FADH2, and four nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) molecules. A maximum of two adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules can be produced from FADH2 and three adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) via the electron transport chain. Thus, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle generates the majority of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during oxidative metabolism in mitochondria, whereas little adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is produced from glycolysis in the cytosol.",0a269839-a5b3-4e2e-a8a1-9e8e09c14c96
6,abstract6,"  The most common technique to quantify local cerebral glucose utilization (cerebral metabolic rate of glucose) is positron emission tomography with the radioactive glucose analogue 18fluoro‐2‐deoxyglucose (FDG).5, 6 Like glucose, FDG is taken up by the brain via facilitative glucose transporters and is phosphorylated by hexokinase. Thereafter, due to the lack of one hydroxyl moiety, FDG‐6‐phosphate gets largely trapped, as it is not further metabolized by glycolysis (Figure 1). The level of radiation emitted from FDG and its metabolites is thought to indicate the rate of glycolysis, because hexokinase is the rate‐limiting enzyme for glycolysis. Thus, low signals seen when using FDG positron emission tomography (positron emission tomography (PET)) are interpreted as low glucose utilization and/or “hypometabolism,” which typically correlate with morphological abnormalities in epileptogenic brain areas.

7,abstract7," Similar to glucose, FDG is moved from plasma into tissue and cells by glucose transporters found on endothelial as well as neuronal and glial cells. Once inside the cells, again like glucose, FDG is phosphorylated by hexokinase to FDG‐6‐phosphate. However, subsequent processing of FDG‐6‐phosphate does not proceed along the lines of glucose‐6‐phosphate (G‐6‐phosphate) in the glycolytic pathway due to the lack of one hydroxyl moiety. Thus, FDG‐6‐phosphate remains mostly trapped inside the cells  Similar results with FDG‐positron emission tomography (PET) and related methods have been found in the brains of people with epilepsy,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 rodent epilepsy models,13, 14, 15 and the canine epileptic brain.16 Typically, in the interictal period, FDG‐positron emission tomography (PET) signals from epileptogenic brain areas are lower than from healthy counterparts even if there is no damage in these areas,17 which suggests that impairments in brain glucose metabolism are possible.",bb914d64-25e8-43e9-b2d8-a8a0d6518bbb

These precursors are important for healthy turnover of proteins and lipids contributing to structural components of the brain and repair of damage after seizures or other detrimental impacts. In addition, most of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produced during aerobic metabolism is produced via oxidative phosphorylation of glucose‐derived carbons involving the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the electron transport chain, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthetase, also called Complex IV.",7950d6fc-e379-441e-a9e7-e2c65b0abf71

Overall, the available data suggest that brain energy metabolism is impaired in epileptogenic foci. This includes (1) impairments in glycolysis from plasma‐derived glucose; (2) decreased activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with reduced entry of glucose‐derived carbons, which at least in part appears to be due to decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH); and (3) decreased production of biosynthetic precursors of amino acids and lipids, which may affect structural integrity and repair in brain tissue.",4b0d2d53-303d-4295-9e1a-7f7962d76020
14,abstract14," More details of additional studies have been summarized by McDonald et al.20  2.3 Proposed mechanism of seizure generation via energy shortage  The lower signals seen with the glucose analogues, FDG, and related molecules in epileptogenic brain areas indicate that there is lower glucose transport and phosphorylation of plasma‐derived glucose by hexokinase . However, areas with epileptic activity require a large amount of energy, as there is high electrical activity, which can be recorded as “interictal spikes”—extra high neuronal activity between seizures. Thus, based on reduced use of plasma glucose, it is likely that there will be an energy deficit. Most of the energy in the brain is required to maintain ion and neurotransmitter balance during synaptic signaling, and also nonsignaling states of the brain, largely involving the energy‐dependent sodium potassium pump (also called sodium potassium adenosine triphosphate (ATP)ase) and glutamate transporters.",062be7c8-1120-47ce-a9f7-1d00c8cb829d
15,abstract15,"3, 39, 40, 41 This is crucial to keep neuronal membrane potentials stable and synaptic activity under control. Thus, it is likely that energy deficits will reduce the activity of the sodium potassium pump and/or other important homeostatic transporters, such as glutamate transporters, which can contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability and subsequent seizure generation. This is corroborated by the finding that chronic inhibition of brain glycolysis (“chronic hypometabolism”) using 2‐desoxyglucose induced epileptiform activity in rats.42 Also, many genetic metabolic disorders are associated with epileptic seizures,43 including in people with deficiency of the main glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), the transporter responsible for glucose uptake into the brain.",7f19ecb5-26b7-4905-a1a3-8b4728a0b468

Taken together and as pointed out by a recent review with our collaborators, glucose hypometabolism found in epileptogenic brain areas provides the rationale for use of auxiliary fuels to provide energy for the brain to maintain normal neuronal signaling and to prevent the generation of seizures.20 Ideally, these fuels would enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle directly and bypass the enzymatic reactions of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) that seem to be impaired. Thus, ketone bodies or MCFAs are good options (Figure 3), as their metabolism is independent of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and they can be supplied via the diet (see Sections 4 and 5).",51df05c9-a13c-4708-8e02-54cccb4e387c
17,abstract17,"20 Consistent with this notion, the current standard treatment for GLUT1 deficiency in people is ketogenic diet,44 which provides ketone bodies that are used as fuel by the brain (e.g., Courchesne‐Loyer et al.45). Please note that lactate can also be used as an auxiliary fuel by the brain,46 but the generation of energy from lactate requires pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. Also, to our knowledge, there is no suitable dietary way to provide lactate in high amounts, as the body cannot be overloaded with sodium or acid.

Ketogenic diets used for the management of epilepsy are typically very high in fat (originally four parts of weight), but very low in protein and carbohydrates (one part in weight together) and are often calorically restricted. In response, blood glucose levels remain in the lower normal range and the liver uses fatty and amino acids to produce the C4 ketone acetoacetic acid and β‐hydroxybutyric acid. Under these conditions, rodent and human brains use these ketone bodies as fuel and less glucose.45, 57, 58 The canine brain can also use ketone bodies as fuel, as shown during hypoxia and infusion of β‐hydroxybutyrate.",80bab5b0-13cb-4a93-bb93-04079bb21679

Especially Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s enriched in octanoate are well known to increase ketone body production (e.g., see Pierre et al.61).

Small or no effects of these MCFAs and Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s were seen in the maximal electroshock test and the models using the GABAA receptor channel blockers pentylenetetrazol and flurothyl. This indicates that the anticonvulsant effects and mechanisms of MCFAs are at least partially distinct, with different carbon chain lengths and Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT) versus MCFA administration.

To our knowledge, there are no studies in chronic epilepsy models in rodents, which are now required before new pharmaceutical treatments enter clinical trials. Unlike the mostly pure octanoic or decanoic acid formulations employed in these published rodent studies, for people and dogs, Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s that contain mixtures of octanoate and decanoate are used. Mixed Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s are better tolerated than pure trioctanoin (Stephen Cunnane, personal communication), and unlike tridecanoin, they remain in oil form at room temperature. Oils are more easily measured and mixed into food than solids, and production of powders and shakes is more straightforward.  4.",05e29d80-07bb-4781-9a40-81fa6a1fcbd5

Thus, auxiliary brain fuels such as MCFAs and/or ketones are indicated to improve adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Taking the studies discussed above together, there is evidence that dietary inclusion of Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s provides MCFAs as well as C4 ketone bodies for direct metabolism in the brain without the need of carbohydrate restriction. Also, several studies showed that Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s improved mitochondrial function and antioxidant defense, and were effective against seizures in rodent models and dogs as well as adults and children with epilepsy. Direct effects of MCFAs potentially together with ketone production are likely to underlie the symptomatic changes in epilepsy, but more studies are needed to confirm these mechanisms.",9f907566-9f1a-4955-b43e-d2cb9e54638f
64,abstract64," Based on the available studies, it is still unclear which Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT) formulations are ideal to prevent seizure generation in people and in dogs. However, decanoic acid and Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s containing this MCFA seem to play an important role and were more efficacious in in vitro and in vivo rodent models. On the other hand, some people with epilepsy had tolerability issues with add‐on Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s, so it will be important to develop Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT) formulations with higher tolerability.  People with epilepsy and owners of dogs with epilepsy are looking for new epilepsy management options with novel mechanisms of actions without the cognitive side effects often associated with ASDs. Dietary add‐on Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s are safe and tolerated when emulsified in food and titrated up slowly.",4e3ea8d0-5fe3-4626-8284-ada9e82a4747
65,abstract65," To date, neither central nervous system and cardiovascular side effects nor teratogenicity have been observed in rodents, dogs, and humans. Because Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s have few serious side effects compared to antiseizure medication, use of Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s may be managed more easily via phone or Skype consultations. This is different from many current ASDs that require closer supervision and sometimes drug monitoring.  In summary, there is now new evidence across species for the efficacy of Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s for epilepsy management. Direct and indirect as well as metabolic and antioxidant effects of MCFAs possibly together with those of C4 ketone bodies are likely to underlie the anticonvulsant mechanisms of Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s. For now, more and larger clinical trials are needed especially in humans to find out whether the effects seen in the small trials conducted so far can be replicated in larger cohorts.",2373c7d5-e0c5-42b5-8012-be41c38728e5
66,abstract66," Randomized controlled studies with sufficient numbers of human patients based on power calculations including the evaluation of confounding factors, such as consumed food, are needed. It will be important to determine the ideal compositions and doses of Medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT)s as well as the types of epilepsy in children, adults, and dogs that respond best.
