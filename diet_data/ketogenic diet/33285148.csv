0,methods0," Experimental procedures  Mice were subjected to mTraumatic brain injury (TBI), and a ketogenic diet (KD) was initiated immediately for the following three timelines: 3 days, 7 days, and 30 days. Ketone bodies in the blood were measured 0, 3, 7, and 30 days post-injury. Behavioral tests were performed at 7 or 30 days following mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) in separate groups of animals. Western blot analysis was carried out on brain tissue collected from 7 and 30 days post mTraumatic brain injury (TBI). Immunohistochemical staining assessments were performed on brains that were collected 30 days post-injury. The timeline of the experimental procedures following exposure to mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is shown in Fig. 6.Figure 6 Study timeline. Animals were exposed to mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) or sham and checked for ketone bodies in the blood at days 0, 3, 7 and 30. Mice were then fed KD/SD for 3, 7, or 30 days.",8e5be7c6-6069-40dc-9235-be51680d2c34
1,methods1," Behavioral tests to assess behavior and cognitive abilities were carried out at 7 and 30 days following mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) in separate cohorts. Western blot analysis to assess changes in SIRT1 levels following mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) and diets management was performed at 7 and 30 days post-mTraumatic brain injury (TBI). Immunohistochemical staining to evaluate neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation was performed at 30 days following the mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) challenge.  Animals  The Sackler Commission on Animal Experimentation ethical committee approved the study and animal protocol 01-19-058 according to the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation of the National Institutes of Health (DHEW publication 23-85, revised, 1995). The study complies with ARRIVE guidelines.  Male ICR mice, aged 6–7 weeks, 30–40 g body weight, were acquired from Envigo RMS Israel.",e928d2d1-f862-442d-9389-3de4465f32a5
2,methods2," Mice were housed at 4–5 per home cage under a constant 12 h light/dark cycle, at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C) in a standard plastic cage (32 × 21.5 × 12 cm3). Water and food was provided ad libitum, and the cages bedding, sterile sawdust, was replaced once per week. All mice were acclimatized to the facility for three days following transport and then moved into the experimental testing room for three days prior to experimentation. Animals were utilized only once throughout the study in either behavioral, biochemistry, or immunocytochemistry tests. Each animal in a given group was tested only once in order to avoid the possible confounding effect of behavioral testing. The number of animals evaluated in each assessment group and the measurement times performed was based on analysis of variance in our previous studies.",3f56b3c0-1c8d-4a1e-b7f5-a906b36beb14
3,methods3,"  Mouse closed-head mild traumatic brain injury  Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTraumatic brain injury (TBI)) was induced according to the closed-head weight-drop model, as employed in our previous studies53,54. The device consisted of an aluminum tube (80 cm in length and 13 mm in diameter). In the pre-injury stage, mice were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane and placed under the device on a sponge, the sponge supported the head of the mouse allowing some anterior–posterior motion, but no rotational head movement at the moment of impact. A metal weight (50 g) was dropped from the top of the tube to strike the head on the right temporal side between the ear and corner of the eye. Sham mice received anesthesia and were placed on the sponge for an equivalent length of time, but no weight was dropped. This model was chosen because it simulates traumatic head injuries such as road accidents or falls, as it imposes a diffuse and non-specific injury.",ddef8360-ab7f-4fa2-94d6-02730de67ec4
4,methods4," Our model, while subject to a certain amount of variability due to the natural anatomic variation, still maintains a high degree of Traumatic brain injury (TBI) injury similarity among all mice as seen in previous neuronal loss models53–56.  Ketogenic Diet  The macronutrient composition of the Ketogenic Diet (TD.96355; Harlan Teklad Laboratories, Madison, WI) was 9.2% protein, 0.3% carbohydrate, and 90.5% fat (% kcal) (Table 1)57–59. The corresponding components of the standard diet (SD) (TD.00606; Harlan Teklad Laboratories, Madison, WI) were 10.1% protein, 77.4% carbohydrate, and 12.5% fat (% kcal)57. The diets and water were provided ad libitum for 3, 7, and 30 days after the injury. Both diets were stored at 4 °C, KD, which had a solid, butter-like texture, was changed every day, and SD pellets were changed twice per week.Table 1 Macronutrient information of each diet.  % Kcal from	Standard diet	Ketogenic diet	 Fat	12.5	90.5	 Carbohydrate	77.4	0.3	 Protein	10.1	9.",5e74ce52-252b-45c4-be30-65fd0b26c4d8
5,methods5,"2	  Measurement of Ketone Bodies  Ketone bodies in the blood were measured using the Precision Xtra Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System (Abbott, Columbus, OH)60. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and tails were cut approximately 0.2 mm from the end, a drop of blood was squeezed directly into a testing strip attached to the measuring instrument. Group sizes were as follows: control (n = 8), mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) (n = 6), KD (n = 6), and mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) + KD (n = 5).  Elevated plus maze  The elevated plus maze (elevated plus maze (EPM)) was used to evaluate anxiety-like behavior61. This assessment relies on the natural anxiety-like behavior exhibited by rodents when placed in brightly lit, open environments. The maze is plus-shaped (+), with arms extending from the center at 90° angles from each other. Opposite arms in the plus formation are identical, with two open arms and two closed (walled) arms measuring 30 × 5 × 1 cm each.",5109c41b-8793-4b48-8d16-a11446058613
6,methods6," During testing, each mouse was placed at the maze's center, facing one of the open arms, and was allowed to explore the maze for 5 min. The amount of time the mice spent in the open arms and the number of entries to the closed and open arms was counted. A longer duration of time spent within the open arms has been associated with lower anxiety levels61,62. Group sizes were as follows: control (n = 19), mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) (n = 18), KD (n = 23), and mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) + KD (n = 24).  Novel object recognition  The novel object recognition (novel object recognition (NOR)) task assesses recognition and visual memory63. This paradigm relies on rodents' natural tendency to investigate novel objects within their environment rather than known ones. novel object recognition (NOR) evaluates whether a mouse is able to discriminate between a familiar and a novel object. The testing arena is a square surface (60 cm × 60 cm) with high walls (20 cm).",e1b55238-bbfc-4881-bfae-6b501b85c28b
7,methods7," The test consists of three 5 min sessions, separated by 24 h. On the first day, mice were individually put in the empty arena for habituation for 5 min. On the second day, the mice were exposed to 2 identical objects within the arena for 5 min. On the third (experimental) day, one of the familiar objects was replaced with a novel object, and mice were allowed to explore the arena again for 5 min, during which time spent near familiar and novel object was measured. The arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol between subjects. An Aggelton index was calculated as follows: (time near new novel object − time near familiar object)/(time near new novel object + time near familiar object)64. A higher Aggelton index indicates advancement in recognition memory. Animals near the objects less than 10% of the total test time (i.e.",801b431d-d486-46b6-a662-87c0624f8bb3
8,methods8,", less than 30 s next to the two objects together) were excluded from statistical calculations, as exploration under this amount of time does not allow estimation of subjects' visual memory. Group sizes were as follows: control (n = 19), mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) (n = 18), KD (n = 23), and mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) + KD (n = 24).  Y-maze  The Y-maze paradigm was used to evaluate spontaneous exploration, responsiveness to novel environments, and spatial memory function, as previously described65. This test relies on the preference of rodents to explore new environments rather than familiar ones. The Y-maze consists of a three-armed black plexiglass maze with arms separated by 120°. Each arm was identical (8 × 30 × 15 cm); however, different spatial cues were placed in each arm (i.e., a triangle, a square, or a circle).",bfc5de8f-9f63-4160-956f-683c89f2e05f
9,methods9," In the first session of the test, the mouse was put in the arena's start arm (chosen randomly) and allowed to explore another arm while the third arm was blocked for 5 min. The mouse was then returned to its home cage for 2 min. In the second session, all arms were open for exploration for 2 min and time spent in each arm was recorded. The arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol between subjects. The time the mouse spent in the familiar arm and the new arm was measured. An Aggelton index was calculated as follows: (time in the new arm − time in the familiar arm)/(time in new arm + time in the familiar arm)64. A higher Aggelton index indicates improved spatial memory. Group sizes were as follows: control (n = 20), mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) (n = 19), KD (n = 24), and mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) + KD (n = 26).",0bfb1570-9743-482c-abf3-d206eab581ee
10,methods10,"  Immunohistochemistry  Immunohistochemistry studies were performed hippocampal (dentate gyrus) and temporal cortex tissue sections obtained from animals euthanized on day 30 post-injury. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and underwent transcardial perfusion with 10 ml phosphate-buffered saline (phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) followed by 20 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (paraformaldehyde (PFA)) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Brains were removed, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and then placed in 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Neuroscience Associates (Knoxville, TN) oriented the brains into a multiblock, collected 35 μm sections sequentially through the brains, and performed the floating section staining and mounting (antibodies detailed in Table 2). Microscopy was performed with a Fluoview 3000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Waltham, MA).",ceb90da6-76c1-4be8-8769-19862140dd03
11,methods11," Target locations were determined on a stitched map with only Hoechst 33342 staining captured. For all analyses, regions of interest were selected on the map depicting only the nuclear staining and blinded with respect to groupings. These regions were then collected by multi area time lapse in sequence with the Fluoview 3000 software without intervention. Images, centered on coronal sections at approximately − 2.9 mm from Bregma, were collected as Z stacks and maximum Z projections with constant illumination (405, 488, 561, and 640 nm diode lasers) and detection parameters. Automated analysis for morphology, intensities, and numbers of cells was conducted using cellSens (Olympus, Waltham, MA, USA) and ImageJ66,67.Table 2 Immunohistochemistry reagents.",bd59fd78-aea3-46bc-811b-829432bec8c2

All of the following steps were iteratively executed for each micrograph in a single macro. Each image was analyzed for the channel containing GFAP staining. Background was subtracted with ImageJ’s built-in rolling ball process, automated thresholding was accomplished with the built in RenyiEntropy algorithm, and noise was removed using the ImageJ despeckle routine.",d75ba0fb-ae94-4eff-a247-68f254e367ab
13,methods13," The image was then skeletonized with the ImageJ plugin andfeatures that were too small to be relevant were removed by the particle remover plugin. The analyze skeleton plugin generated the process lengths per cell. These routines have previously been shown to identify reactive morphology66,67.  Frames included in figures are correct concerning orientation, i.e., dorsal at the top, left, and right. Confocal scanning was rotated 30° to optimize the framing of regions of interest. Group sizes were as follows: control (n = 5), mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) (n = 5), KD (n = 5), and mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) + KD (n = 5).  Western blotting  To assess the cortical and hippocampal SIRT1 levels, brains were dissected following cervical dislocation at 7 and 30 days post-injury. The cortex and hippocampus were separated and frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored in − 80 °C.",e380fcf0-4e4f-444c-90b0-39ca4568326b
14,methods14," Prior to analysis, brains were homogenized in lysis buffer (Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent, Pierce, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) using a Teflon pestle homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C 14,000 r/min, supernatant liquids were separated from the precipitates and stored at − 80 °C.

30,discussion0," Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability in the developed world, with more than 10 million people suffering worldwide every year37. The majority of these Traumatic brain injury (TBI)s (80–95%) are mild in nature7,8. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) symptoms can occasionally resolve within the first year after injury, but up to 70–90% of patients continue to manifest prolonged and often permanent neurocognitive dysfunction. In light of the growing reports suggesting beneficial effects of KD in many neurological disorders13–15, the primary goal of this study was to assess the benefits of KD in mTraumatic brain injury (TBI). Our results suggest that KD may be a vital treatment modality, mitigating Traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced cognitive impairments, neuronal loss, and neuroinflammation in the closed-head mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) mouse model.  We delivered a mild Traumatic brain injury (TBI) to mice followed by up to 30 days of KD or SD.",9fec2506-a81a-4961-bac0-0c24b5d61012
31,discussion1," We were able to confirm that mice who received KD (with or without mTraumatic brain injury (TBI)) demonstrated a prominent increase in ketone bodies compared to mice fed SD at 3, 7, and 30 days after the diet. Previous studies have demonstrated that mice challenged with mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) show cognitive impairments in visual and spatial memory10,38. Our previous published studies as well as the present study, ruled out the possible involvement of anxiety (as assessed by elevated plus maze (EPM)) in the cognitive performance of the injured mice. This study's results replicated the previous findings regarding both visual and spatial memory while demonstrating that KD significantly ameliorated these cognitive deficits.",dd86be25-afdf-42a0-9898-597312e5431a
32,discussion2," These results support previous studies on the benefits of KD on brain injury in the short-term (7 days); rats who were fed KD exhibited evidence of neuroprotection after head trauma in the cortex and hippocampus39 and improvement in motor performance in Beam balance and Beam walk tests18, KD administration has also been shown to reduce brain edema and cellular apoptosis 72 h after Traumatic brain injury (TBI)40 and has demonstrated anti-tumor effects within the brain in rodent models41.  To better understand the molecular effects of Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and KD, we evaluated SIRT1 levels in two brain regions, cortex and hippocampus, which play crucial roles in memory formation. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) reduced the levels of SIRT1 in cortex and in the hippocampus 30 days post-injury which was ameliorated by KD, suggesting a potential mechanism contributing to cognitive impairment and improvement in cognitive symptoms when given KD42.",49148bf9-fc33-43c4-a052-f1a1da045b9a
33,discussion3," In contrast, at 7 days post-injury SIRT1 levels were not reduced in the cortex and hippocampus. This supports past findings showing an elevation in SIRT1 levels 1 day prior to ischemia that gradually decreased over a period of 7 days36. Our study's results align with prior studies of intermittent fasting and caloric restriction for 30 days post-injury28 and with research involving KD and SIRT1 in health-enhancing, aging, longevity, and neurodegeneration in animal models43,44.  We have previously reported that our mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) model decreases the neuronal survival 3 weeks post injury45. Similarly, in the present study, we have shown a significant increase in neuronal cell death that persists 30 days following injury in both cortex and hippocampus. KD prevented this neuronal cell death. These results are consistent with an in vitro study that found the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate reduced axonal degeneration in diffuse axonal injury46.",c2379466-3bda-49cb-b9e4-0cabf484b687
34,discussion4," Additionally, we saw a marked increase in reactive astrocytes in hippocampus 30 days following injury, which was ameliorated by KD. We have previously reported that our mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) model induces fundamental neuroinflammatory changes, including elevations in astrocyte reactivity, pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α levels, and expression of genes involved in inflammatory processes in several regions of the brain44,47–50. We can conclude that KD prevented the injury-induced neuro-inflammation, which is in agreement with previous studies that reported KD inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thus exerting neuroprotective effects17.  Our closed head injury mouse model of mild Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was able to recapitulate the cognitive deficits observed in human Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients51,52 and showed that ketogenic diet beginning following injury could protect against injury-induced memory loss.",cd011c18-f5f0-495d-8e7e-d9f1f1587dd7
35,discussion5," At the cellular level, we have demonstrated that mTraumatic brain injury (TBI) induced neuronal cell death, astrocyte and microglial activation (neuro-inflammation), which were prevented in injured mice treated with KD. Our analysis of changes in SIRT1 suggests a viable molecular mechanism by which KD may be improving cognitive outcomes. Our results support accumulating evidence that KD may represent an important non-pharmaceutical treatment against the long-term molecular and cellular impacts of mTraumatic brain injury (TBI), which may ultimately improve cognitive symptoms and quality of life for Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients.
