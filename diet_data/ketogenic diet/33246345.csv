0,discussion0," Controversies and Adverse Effects of the KD  The mechanisms of neuroprotection described above have often been studied in a single animal model and the generalizability to other sources of neuronal injury and different neuronal tissues are unknown. Notably, the effect of ketone bodies on antioxidants has been shown to differ across brain regions (56) and exhibit age-specific effects (15), which may underly variations in outcomes of the KD among different studies. As noted above, high concentrations of bodies are beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) were found to induce pro-inflammatory signaling which is the opposite effect of lower concentrations (51); because of this dose-dependent bodies are beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) effect on inflammation, it is important to measure serum and/or tissue bodies are beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels to properly assess the effect of the KD.",dbd77fa9-c056-4e1f-b725-9311a3036117
1,discussion1," Additionally, beneficial effects of the KD in animals have been shown to not always translate to a benefit in humans, for example, motor improvements were shown in rat models of PD but not patients with PD. Therefore, extrapolating the results of studies from animals to humans must always been done cautiously. Furthermore, it is important to consider that molecular mechanisms that lead to reduced inflammation and lower oxidative stress may change with longer durations of the diet, and the reported short-term mechanisms of neuroprotection may not necessarily contribute to its long-term effects.  Adopting the KD would appear to contradict current dietary guidelines that recommend reduced intake of total fat. However, potential negative effects of elevated dietary fat intake appear to be balanced by the beneficial effects of reduced carbohydrates and elevated ketones. The KD is popular with the general public for weight loss and side effects generally are minor.",9aa99d77-75ff-4ee8-a100-69a5eb58b105
2,discussion2," However, long-term strict adherence to the diet is associated with adverse effects, and gastrointestinal issues (such as diarrhea, abdominal distention, reflux), cardiac problems (arrhythmia) and poor growth have been noted in pediatric epilepsy patients on the KD (67–69), although a confounding variable is that these patients often have underlying metabolic and other health issues. Less common but more severe side effects include specific nutrient deficiencies, kidney stones, bone fractures and increased infections, which can be treated with standard therapies and appropriate vitamin and nutrient supplementation while maintaining the diet (70). For example, several case reports indicate that complications of the KD included protein–losing enteropathy, edema and hypoalbuminemia; in a recent case report these issues were resolved by reducing the fat to carbohydrate ratio in the diet (71).",62a56123-86c6-4c7d-8215-11e4f330c116
3,discussion3," Another report demonstrated that most gastrointestinal and nutrient deficiencies occurring early (< 4 weeks on the diet) and complications such as anemia and cardiomyopathy occurring late (> 4 weeks) were transient and successfully managed (69).  The effect of the KD on growth and skeletal health was reviewed by Merlotti et al. (72). Multiple studies in rats on the KD and modified KD combined with other treatments indicated reduced biomechanical function, reduced bone mineral density and increased osteoporosis. In contrast, most studies with patients on the KD showed no or minimal negative effects on growth, bone mass or molecular markers of bone health over 24 months (72). In a long-term retrospective study of pediatric patients on the diet for 8 years, a low but significant frequency of individuals with reduced bone mineral density was observed (73).",7fd9bec9-acb6-4a31-8b90-b8753e8967a8
4,discussion4," This observation may be explained by a potential relationship between the genetic cause of epilepsy and skeletal damage, for example GLUT1 gene mutations (72). Additionally, in a study on children who had followed the KD for a median of 6 years and then discontinued the diet at least 6 months prior to the study, no long-term effects were observed on physical growth, lipid levels and other measurements (74). Therefore, current evidence does not indicate significant effects on bone metabolism, although most studies may not be long enough duration to determine increased risk of fractures or altered bone health.  Future Research Directions  There are several key gaps in knowledge about the KD that require further investigation. First, determining whether the KD reduces pathology and alleviates neurological symptoms of the diseases discussed above should be clarified with randomized clinical trials using blinded clinical assessments whenever possible and appropriate control diets.",e8938eb9-3e45-4d2e-afcc-aab247516b0f
5,discussion5," Second, due to potential side effects and potential non-compliance with the diet, it is important to consider whether exogenous ketones can be used to achieve therapeutic levels of circulating ketone bodies, as suggested from studies in animal models of disease. Third, multiple cell types react to and metabolize ketone bodies, and further investigation into whether inflammatory cells, glia and neurons respond differently to ketone bodies should be explored. Fourth, understanding mechanisms of brain region-specific and age-dependent neuroprotection of the KD may reveal new insights into the regulation of neuronal survival pathways and the influence of bioenergetic pathways. Fifth, identification of potential mechanisms of neuroprotection may be used to develop biomarkers or indicators of the effectiveness of the diet, such as changes in specific plasma cytokines.",5dca7892-0901-404e-9463-98d46a259a85
6,discussion6," Sixth, further detailed characterization of the mechanisms that modify the effect of KD-induced neuroprotection is needed, including the role of expression levels of relevant transcription factors, bodies are beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) receptors and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) transporters, local ketone body concentration, gut microbiome species and mitochondrial density and function, all of which could contribute to variation in the response to KD. Finally, additional studies should determine whether modified KDs, which are less restrictive and may be easier to adopt, would also have beneficial effects for the conditions described above including investigation of improving quality of life in the aging population.  Conclusions  As described above, the KD has been used for many years to reduce seizures in treatment-intractable pediatric epilepsy and was confirmed to be effective in a randomized control clinical trial (11).",1a1d2a17-ded7-439d-801b-e59d3f538ddc
7,discussion7," Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated neuroprotection from the KD or direct administration of ketone bodies in numerous animal models of neurological disease, including stroke, glaucoma and spinal cord injury, which raises the possibility that the KD may reduce symptoms in patients with these conditions. However, the existing literature on the effectiveness of the KD in several neurological disorders shows that it reduces symptoms and improves quality of life in several diseases when tested in small pilot studies, such as MS and Alzheimer's disease, but results from larger randomized clinical trials have not yet been reported. Furthermore, the duration of the beneficial effects is unknown because all studies have been short-term, except for analysis of side effects in epilepsy patients.",f30ed9ee-06b8-43a7-8c3e-99211f8e2509
8,discussion8," Finally, variations in the composition of the diet, duration of treatments, and frequently small sample sizes in the study groups, make it difficult to compare and draw conclusions across studies. Therefore, although adverse effects of the KD are minimal, evidence does not yet indicate adopting the KD for reducing neurodegeneration in common neurological diseases.
