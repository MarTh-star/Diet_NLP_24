The highest cited reference was published in PLoS ONE, and authored by Abdelwahab Mohammed G with 161 citations, which reported that KD enhanced the anti-tumor effect of radiotherapy in malignant gliomas by elevating the level of β-hydroxybutyrate (18). Furthermore, “malignant glioma” was the most common type of cancer in this field, which may be closely related to the first use of KD in the treatment of brain glioma.  Hotspots and development trends  The hotspots and frontiers in this field could be revealed by the highest cited references, analysis of keyword burst and co-occurrence clusters.",0722f8cd-d51b-432f-8dfa-745d359159e0
22,discussion3," By generalizing the analysis, we can draw the following points in this field. First, the hotspots and trends of KD in cancer types. The keywords “hippocampus,” “glioblastoma” and “temozolomide” from the clusters of keywords and co-cited references indicated that the research of KD on cancer was mainly focused on glioma. As well-known, KD was first used in epilepsy treatment for effective symptoms control (20). Meanwhile, one in four patients undergoing epilepsy surgery has brain tumors, indicating a strong connection was existed between the brain tumors and epilepsy (21). In addition, keywords analysis demonstrated that KD has high attention on the research of breast cancer and prostate cancer. A recent clinical study demonstrated that KD therapy played a beneficial role by reducing TNF- α, and insulin, and increasing IL-10 in breast cancer patients (22). Besides, Kaiser et al.",9c5fec35-21ca-4b92-97af-53b4fa9c6a8b
23,discussion4," concluded that KD could inhibit the growth of prostate cancer through regulation of the insulin resistance signaling pathways (23). Notably, the burst keywords of “hepatocellular carcinoma” and “pancreatic cancer” indicated that the treatment of KD in the two types of cancer were the new hotspots. Wang et al. reported that KD could inhibit the progression of HCC by increasing the expression of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 in hepatocytes and regulating lipid metabolism (24). Meanwhile, KD exerted anti-HCC effects and increased serum β-hydroxybutyrate levels by inducing histone hyperacetylation (25). Summarily, liver is the glucose and lipid metabolic center that produces ketone bodies, KD has a broad application prospect in the treatment of HCC (26). In addition, several recent studies have demonstrated that KD effectively inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic by reprogramming cell metabolism, epigenome, and the gut microbiome (27, 28).",2cacf8b8-7d15-4d77-a8cb-e44f98b35e3f
24,discussion5," These results suggested that glioma and breast cancer were the most studied cancer types in this field, while hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer were the new hotspots and trends.  Second, the hotspots and trends of the anti-tumor mechanism of KD. Through the analysis of keywords and cited-references, we found that the anti-tumor mechanism of KD mainly focused on regulation of metabolism, decanoic acid, fatty acid oxidation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Robust evidence showed that KD executed anti-tumor effect by regulating metabolism, which is manifested by a decrease in glucose concentration and an increase in the concentration of ketone body and 3-hydroxybutyric acid (29, 30). Ketone body and 3-hydroxybutyric acid were confirmed to play an important role in promoting tumor immunity by inhibiting the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome (31).",86ef56c4-3d0d-467c-8dc4-376cee0b1be7
25,discussion6," Cancer cells were mainly metabolized using aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), nevertheless KD as a carbohydrate-restricted dietary pattern, can effectively inhibit glucose/insulin signaling, mitochondrial metabolism and inflammation reaction, thereby hindering the development and deterioration of cancers (32, 33). Notably, the latest study found that KD could promote the production of decanoic acid, and inhibit the AMPA receptor, given that to inhibit the growth of cancer (34). Unfortunately, oxidative stress may aggravate both the damage of tissue and the progression of cancer via promoting the formation of reactive lipid fragments (35). Nevertheless, oxidative stress was significantly inhibited by KD therapy to contribute the effects of anti-inflammation and anti-tumor properties (36).",3dab6522-0820-44fc-b6c4-d17b51989d09
26,discussion7," Meanwhile, the metabolism regulation of KD to exert anti-tumor effects has been widely researched, while elucidating the anti-tumor effects of KD from the perspective of decanoic acid and fatty acid oxidation is a current hotspot.  Third, the hotspots and trends of KD synergy with anti-tumor. Based on the analysis of keywords, several keywords related to anti-tumor treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and temozolomide were identified, indicating that KD combined with anti-tumor therapy is a hotspot in this field. Further study confirmed that breast cancer patients in the KD combined with chemotherapy group had a higher quality of life and physical activity scores at 6 weeks compared to the chemotherapy group, while lower levels of lactate and ALP in serum, suggesting that KD may significant beneficial for the patients with breast cancer (37).",83f23266-301a-418a-a2d9-b49ec531bd47
27,discussion8," Simultaneously, accumulating evidence suggested that KD therapy can improve chemotherapy sensitivity and reduce target lesions in different cancers, such as lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer (38–41). In addition, radiotherapy is the mainstay of anti-tumor treatment, which can significantly improve the survival rate of cancer patients. Study had reported that KD preserved fat free and skeletal muscle mass and effectively improved global quality of life in breast cancer patients undergoing curative radiotherapy (13); it also partially counteracted the adverse effects of radiotherapy on body composition in head and neck cancer patients (42). Importantly, the cluster of keywords showed that immunotherapy is the new hotspot in this field recently. Ferrere G confirmed that KD enhanced the anti-neoplastic effects of PD-1 blockade (43).",988cb532-df3e-4fa6-ae54-c5813f92dcb1
28,discussion9," Further, the latest experiment reinforced theory that KD partly stimulated anti-tumor immunity and strengthened checkpoint blockade immune-therapy via AMPK mediated decreasing PD-L1 protein abundance (14). To the best of our knowledge, most of studies had focused on animal experiments in this field, whereas the robust clinical evidence was still inadequacy. Hence, more high-quality randomized clinical trials to evaluate the combined effects of KD and anti-neoplastic therapy, especially the combination of KD and immunotherapy, are urgently warranted, which is the current research trend in this field. Notably, although KD was regarded as a tolerable method during the clinical management of cancers, some adverse effects have also been reported, such as causing constipation, fatigue, and micronutrient deficiencies in the patients with cancers (44, 45).",80710007-1579-4bd9-bdbb-cdd7fe3fd810
29,discussion10," Therefore, more attention should be paid to the potential adverse reactions of KD in the treatment of anti-tumor in the future clinical researches.  Strengths and limitations  This is the first bibliometric and visual analysis in the field of KD on Cancer, and this study identified the latest research trends and hotspots in this field. Hence, a perspective to the developing trend of KD on cancer was presented, which may help researchers to explore new directions for future research. However, some limitations should be illustrated. First, the data were only extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC), and no other databases (such as PubMed and Embase) were used, which may lead to under-extraction of publications. However, Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) has collected more than 20,000 authoritative and influential academic journals. Therefore, the results and findings of this study were robust.",daf7d61f-7401-4afb-afdb-f3700ed31923
30,discussion11," Second, only studies published in English were retrieved from the database, which may lead to source bias. In addition, although we have clearly defined the research topic during the search, it is still not guaranteed that every document is completely relevant to the topic, which leads to the results of incomplete inclusion of core keywords. However, incorrect extraction and omission of publications could be prevented by topic searches. Therefore, this study can still highlight the general situation and research trends in this field.  Conclusions  This study provided a general overview of the main research hotspots and frontiers of KD on cancer research. Summarially, glioma and breast cancer were the most studied cancer types in this field, while hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer gained more attention recently. In addition, KD may exert anti-tumor effects by regulating metabolism, oxidative stress, and fatty acid oxidation.",11208c09-a81f-49ad-817b-6004ab0b7e4a
31,discussion12," Meanwhile, current clinical studies mainly focused on KD combined with chemoradiotherapy for glioma and breast cancer, and the findings demonstrated that KD could effectively improve the anti-tumor effects, reduce adverse effects, and enhance the quality of life. However, more molecular studies and corresponding large-sample RCTs are urgently needed to assess the clinical application of KD as a metabolic therapy, and the potential adverse effects of KD in cancer treatment should be closely concerned. Meanwhile, the development of diversified ketogenic products to improve patient compliance is also a hotspot for future research due to the difficulty of long-term adherence to KD in cancer patients.
