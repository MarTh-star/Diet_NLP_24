0,introduction0,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disease causing weakness in skeletal muscles of the limbs, respiration and swallowing. It is invariably fatal and is caused by the death of neurons responsible for voluntary muscle control in the spinal cord and brain [1]. Currently, there is no effective treatment for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and existing pharmacological therapy is limited to one agent, riluzole, causing modest slowing of disease progression. Furthermore, since the causes of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are likely multi-factorial and have been demonstrated to involve both genetic and environmental factors, targets for treatment are not easily identifiable [2], [3].",a420dd51-f211-444f-892e-527bba4deaf0
1,introduction1," A large portion of familial forms of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (FAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) have been linked to a mutation in the superoxide dismutase (SOD)1 gene [4], [5], and several mouse models that express disease-related mutant SOD1 develop motor neuron degeneration similar to that in humans [6], [7], [8]. Despite the limitations of the transgenic SOD1 animal models, they remain the best tools to investigate potential new human therapies [9].  Mitochondrial abnormalities in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can be seen in the spinal motor neurons of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients [10], [11] and in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice [12], [13], [14].",557b633c-6856-42dc-8f3e-0a459e703e19
2,introduction2," Decreased activity of electron transport chain complex IV has been observed in the spinal cords [15], [16] and muscle of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients [17], [18], in the spinal cords of SOD1-G93A transgenic mice [19], [20], [21], and in a motor neuron cell line expressing SOD1 mutant proteins [22]. Lower mitochondrial respiration with complex I substrates has also been found in sporadic Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (substrates has also been found in sporadic Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (SAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS))) muscle [18], [23]. Chronic mitochondrial inhibition induces selective motor neuron death in vitro, recapitulating some of the pathological aspects of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [24].",fcfc3ca7-229f-42c0-a7c7-e17547a142a8
3,introduction3," It is noteworthy that mitochondrial dysfunction has been observed in both FAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and substrates has also been found in sporadic Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (SAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) patients, the latter group constituting the vast majority of patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction mechanism posited for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the protective effect of energy metabolism substrates, such as coenzyme Q [25] and creatine [26], against neuronal damage induced by excitotoxicity and mitochondrial inhibition has been reported both in vitro and in vivo. In recent clinical trials, the mitochondrial modulator dexpramipexole [27] is emerging as a promising candidate for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) therapy [28].",9a69f9e9-b4cd-4a44-8b1f-2c08893f8866
4,introduction4,"  Ketones (or ketonic bodies), consisting essentially of D-β-3 hydroxybutyrate (D β 3 hydroxybutyrate (DBH)) and acetoacetate are derived from fat catabolism in liver mitochondria and are inversely proportional to the levels of glucose in the blood [29]. Circulating D β 3 hydroxybutyrate (DBH) crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters mitochondria where it is metabolized to acetoacetate and converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters into the Krebs cycle [30]. Ketogenic diets are high fat, low carbohydrate diets that increase levels of circulating ketones. Protective effects of ketogenic diets have been demonstrated in several neurological disorders notably in epilepsy [31], [32], and in rodent models of Parkinson’s disease [33], pain and inflammation [34] and juvenile traumatic brain injury [35], [36], [37]. We have previously reported the beneficial role of a ketogenic diet in improving motor function and survival of SOD1-G93A transgenic mice [38].",846c00bd-e04a-415c-aff5-da6bf3f699af
5,introduction5,"  Medium chain triglyceride diets were developed as a more palatable modification of the ketogenic diet [39]. Medium chain triglycerides are six to twelve carbon fatty acid esters of glycerol. They are highly ketogenic and due to their small size, they are hydrolyzed into free fatty acids in the intestine and rapidly absorbed (reviewed in [40]). Caprylic triglyceride is an eight carbon medium chain triglyceride, which is metabolized into ketone bodies that can serve as an alternate energy substrate for neuronal metabolism. Caprylic acid is the main constituent of the medium-chain triglyceride diet advocated for seizure therapy [41] and it has been demonstrated to cross the blood-brain barrier [42], to exert antiepileptic effects [43] and to increase the effectiveness of the anticonvulsant drug, valproic acid [44], in mouse models of seizure. Also known as fractionated coconut oil, caprylic triglyceride is widely used in many skin products due to its rapid penetration ability.",63f4ffb7-433c-4981-ac37-55e7c73e8abb
6,introduction6," It has been previously developed as a medical food to promote mitochondrial metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease [45].  In this study, we treated SOD1-G93A transgenic mice with caprylic triglyceride to test whether this medium chain triglyceride may alter the progression of the motor impairment through modulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism.

7,methods0,"Ethics Statement All procedures were approved by the Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)).  Experimental Animals and Diets Male SOD1-G93A mutant transgenic mice (stock #002297) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Only males were used because of the background and gender effects on survival in this mouse model of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [21]. Caprylic triglyceride in its liquid form was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and used for both in vitro and in vivo studies. At 50 days of age, SOD1-G93A animals or their wild type littermates were placed on solid diets containing 10% (w/w) caprylic triglyceride (caloric composition: fat 34%, carbohydrate 46%, protein 20%) or a control isocaloric diet (Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). Mice had access to food and water ad libitum. Body weight, food intake and motor function assessment were monitored weekly.",f7553b64-bf07-419a-8a2e-954d22edbc76
8,methods1," The survival study endpoint was defined as meeting any one of the following conditions: no spontaneous breathing or movement for 60 seconds with no response to pain; the animal was unable to roll over to the normal position within 10 s following a push over; or complete hind limb paralysis.  Assessment of Motor Function Mice were tested on an accelerating rotarod (7650 Ugo Basile Biological Research Apparatus, Comerio, Italy) as previously described. In brief, mice are placed onto a grooved cylinder (facing away from the experimenter) rotating at a predetermined speed that incrementally increases to a maximal rotation at 300 s; the time maintained on the rod by each mouse (latency) is then recorded (300 s max). A diminishing latency indicates declining performance and at values of 0 s is suggestive of severe muscular weakness and impaired coordination. Mice were tested weekly, beginning at 60 days of age, until they could no longer perform the test.",f3cb9202-1fb1-4e85-a3d1-97e0d240c259
9,methods2," Before testing, mice underwent a 1 week training period wherein they were introduced to the apparatus and handled by the experimenter daily. Testing was conducted during the last 4 h of the day portion of the light cycle in an environment with minimal stimuli such as noise, movement, or changes in light or temperature.  Glucose Tolerance Test (Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT)) Mice were fasted overnight in clean cages with free access to water in new clean bottles. The next morning each mouse was weighed, and a baseline fasted blood glucose measurement was taken by applying tail blood to a Contour Blood Glucose Monitoring System (Bayer). Each mouse was injected intraperitoneally with a filter-sterilized solution of 20% (w/v) D-glucose, with the size of the bolus determined by animal weight (2 mg glucose/g body weight). Blood glucose measurements were taken as described above for each animal at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min.",1c09344f-642b-4c9e-b1d4-2c63b8d822b2
10,methods3," The data were plotted as blood glucose concentration (mg/dL) over time (minutes).  Blood Ketone, Corticosterone and Triglyceride Level Assessment Blood ketone level was obtained at pre-symptomatic stage (9 weeks) and post-symptomatic stage (17 weeks) by applying tail blood to a Precision Xtra® Blood Ketone Monitoring System (Abbott Laboratories) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma corticosterone level was determined using Corticosterone ELISA (Enzo Life Sciences).

The spinal cords were dissected out and immediately processed for isolation of mitochondria. Mitochondria were prepared by differential centrifugation and mitochondrial respiratory function was measured using the Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA) as previously published [48], with the modification that 40 µg mitochondrial protein per well was used for complex I OCR and 20 µg for complex II OCR measurements. Spare respiratory capacity was calculated as the difference between the maximal and basal OCRs. ",2fd3ae90-9ab2-4c92-95a3-4c88f3781038
15,results0,"Caprylic Triglyceride Significantly Attenuated Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-type Motor Impairment in SOD1-G93A Transgenic Mice Caprylic triglyceride did not result in any change in body weight (Fig. 1A) or motor performance (Fig. 1B) in wild type animals as compared to control group, suggesting that caprylic triglyceride is very well tolerated.  Important behavioral and physiological characteristics of SOD1-G93A transgenic mice include impaired motor performance, weight loss and reduced survival. SOD1-G93A mice fed caprylic acid showed no significant difference in weight as compared to those on control diet (Fig. 1C). There was no difference between the two groups in the amount of food consumed (Fig. 2A). In the caprylic triglyceride fed animals, motor function was significantly improved relative to controls (two way ANOVA analysis, F = 6.56, p = 0.01) (Fig. 1D), especially at week 14, 15 and 16 (Bonferroni post-test, *p<0.05).",2008e9d0-7792-48fb-9e20-f8a64861fa9d
16,results1,"  We also monitored the survival of the experimental animals (Fig. 2B). SOD1-G93A animals on caprylic triglyceride diet had a median survival of 135 days. Although it was longer than the median survival of SOD1-G93A animals on control diet (129 days), it did not reach statistical significance (Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.165).  10.1371/journal.pone.0049191.g003Figure 3 Glucose tolerance, ketone, triglyceride and corticosterone levels following caprylic triglyceride treatment.

Data are mean ± SEM, n = 3–4 per group, *p<0.05 by two-tailed t-test.  Effect of Caprylic Triglyceride on Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance has been reported in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients [49]. To test whether caprylic triglyceride could beneficially affect the regulation of blood glucose levels, we performed a glucose tolerance test in the experimental animals. We first compared the fasting blood glucose levels between the two groups (Fig. 3A) and found that caprylic triglyceride treatment did not change the fasting glucose level in SOD1-G93A animals. We also recorded their glucose levels at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose injection (2 mg/g body weight). Although two way ANOVA analysis did not reveal any major difference between the caprylic triglyceride treatment group and control group (Fig.",22ea08c0-9df1-4360-a159-067c031e0beb
18,results3," 3B), a significantly lower glucose level at 60 min post-injection was observed in the animals fed with caprylic triglyceride (Bonferroni post-test, *p<0.05).  10.1371/journal.pone.0049191.g005Figure 5 Mitochondrial bioenergetic profile in the spinal cord of WT and SOD1 G93A mice on control or caprylic triglyceride diet.

Caprylic Triglyceride Safely Increased Blood Ketone Level Caprylic triglyceride is metabolized into ketone bodies in the liver. To determine whether caprylic triglyceride treatment could result in increased concentrations of ketone in the SOD1-G93A animals, we measured the blood ketone level in mice fed caprylic triglyceride or control isocaloric diet. The caprylic triglyceride fed mice showed about a 2.5 fold increase in the blood concentration of circulating ketones compared to animals on control diet (0.54±0.10 vs 0.22±0.06 mmol/L, p = 0.027 by two-tailed t-test) at post-symptomatic stage (Figure 3C).",cbd9bcea-ce3c-4e40-a80e-7f0155e6efb5
20,results5," We also measured the lipid profile (Figure 3D) in the plasma and no difference was detected. Higher corticosterone levels have been demonstrated to significantly correlate with an earlier onset of paralysis in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients [50]. We measured cortisosterone levels in the plasma (Figure 3E) and no difference was found following caprylic triglyceride administration.  Caprylic Triglyceride Protected Against Motor Neuron Loss To determine whether caprylic triglyceride can protect against the motor neuron loss that accompanies the clinical symptoms of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we counted the number of motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord in mice on the caprylic triglyceride diet compared to those on control isocaloric diet at the post-symptomatic stage (day 110) (Figure 4A). There were significantly higher numbers of motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord of mice on a caprylic triglyceride diet than those on control diet (23.96±4.38 vs. 14.61±2.",38143c6d-f923-4112-974b-8949125a8b06
21,results6,"31, p = 0.02 by two-tailed t-test) (Figure 4B) and the treatment returned the motor neuron count to that found in WT mice of the same age (20.4±0.5; from our previously published data [51]).  Caprylic Triglyceride Promoted Oxygen Consumption in Spinal Cord Mitochondria of SOD1-G93A Mice To evaluate the effect of caprylic triglyceride in the mitochondrial bioenergetic profile, we isolated the spinal cord mitochondria of WT and SOD1-G93A animals fed 10% caprylic triglyceride or control isocaloric diet at post-symptomatic stage (day 110) and measured oxygen consumption rate using the Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer. WT mice on control and caprylic triglyceride diets had comparable OCRs (Fig. 5D). We found that basal and FCCP-induced maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates in the presence of the complex I substrates pyruvate and malate were increased in the spinal cord of caprylic triglyceride treated SOD1-G93A mice relative to mice fed control isocaloric diet (Fig.",2b7dc272-5625-476c-b2c4-4ee2d93e2155
22,results7," 5A and 5B; p<0.05 by two-tailed t test). Following caprylic triglyceride treatment, spare respiratory capacity remained unchanged in WT mice and showed a trend for increase in SOD1-G93A mice which did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 5C). Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-stimulated state 3 respiration and OCR with complex IV electron donors showed a trend for increase, which did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 5B). Oligomycin inhibited state 4o OCR remained unchanged (data not shown). There was no significant difference in OCR with the complex II substrate succinate in spinal cord mitochondria of WT as compared to SOD1 G93A mice or of the control and caprylic triglyceride SOD1 G93A mice (data not shown). This evidence suggested that long term treatment of caprylic triglyceride changed the metabolic response, possibly through alterations of the checkpoints for control of mitochondrial respiration.

23,discussion0,Our study demonstrated that SOD1-G93A transgenic animals fed caprylic triglyceride showed significant improvement in the clinical signs of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in motor neuron survival in the spinal cord. The improvement of motor performance in caprylic triglyceride-treated animals (Fig. 1D) was accompanied by significantly more motor neurons preserved in the spinal cord at the end stage of disease (Fig. 4). These findings are similar to our previously reported findings in G93A transgenic mice fed a ketogenic diet [38] as well as the R6/2 1J Huntington’s disease model [52].  It has been reported that Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with elevated triglyceride and cholesterol serum levels have a prolonged survival [53].,1237f9c3-d34d-420d-a9f8-8b9c9b7f76c2
24,discussion1," Our data showed that animals treated with caprylic triglyceride did not have a prolonged life span as compared to the control group, possibly due to the fact that the treatment did not result in increased serum triglyceride/cholesterol level (Fig. 3D). Future studies will address the effect, if any, of caprylic triglyceride on denervation in the neuromuscular junction, which may be a contributory factor to the lack of effect on survival following treatment. It should be noted that the transgenic mouse and the treatment used in this study were quite stringent–a severe genetic model and a highly restrictive diet formulation. It will also be necessary to assess the efficacy of caprylic triglyceride diet in other models of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) such as the TDP-43 or FUS/TLS mice to determine whether the benefits we have observed are due to specific to the SOD1 mutant.",0f0ca978-da33-465b-8b6c-68ddaffe0aac
25,discussion2,"  Caprylic triglyceride can be metabolized into ketone bodies, and serve as an alternate energy substrate for neuronal metabolism. Our results showed increased basal and maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates in the spinal cord together with elevated ketone levels in the blood of caprylic triglyceride-treated Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) transgenic animals, suggesting that the additional ketones provided by caprylic triglyceride might be used as an alternate substrate for energy metabolism in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) animals. The increased maximal respiration (Fig. 5C) may represent improved mitochondrial respiratory capacity in the disease model. Further studies are required to determine whether the trend for increase in mitochondrial respiratory capacity is due to changes in the neuronal or glial mitochondrial content and/or regulation of metabolic activities.",41c36f8d-3114-4074-9e38-09160a8ca9aa
26,discussion3," It is noteworthy that the decrease in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity observed by histochemical methods in the spinal cord of SOD1-G93A mice as compared to WT [51] is not detectable by the assay used in this study (Fig. 5B and 5D). This could be due to the fact that the current assay using mitochondrial preparations from the whole spinal cord cannot detect the area-specific decrease in mitochondrial activity in the ventral horn of the lumbar spinal cord. Another drawback of our study is that the mice were sacrificed by carbon dioxide inhalation and exposure to hypercapnic/hypoxic conditions are known to alter mitochondrial function [54]. We have taken maximum care to ensure that the different groups of mice were treated identically during euthanasia but the effects of hypoxia cannot be completely discounted.  It has been reported that caprylic triglyceride, when used as a medical food, attenuates cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease [55].",1289cf84-d0a4-4af3-b5f3-4500794bcb16
27,discussion4," Although further research is needed to better understand the mechanism and magnitude of the clinical impact that caprylic acid has on transgenic mouse models, there is now a basis to move this treatment into human studies. The ability to objectively measure pharmacologic effects (ketone bodies and lipids, Fig. 3C and 3D) will easily translate into phase I safety and tolerability, accelerating the decision whether or not to proceed with efficacy studies.  Microscopy was performed at the MSSM-Microscopy Shared Resource Facility. =",86b1cfc8-2e01-426a-a7db-bae936089d34
