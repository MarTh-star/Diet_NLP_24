0,methods0," 4.1. Mice  Male C57BL/6 mice (7–8 weeks of age) were purchased from Taiwan National Laboratory Animal Center. Mice were fed with a standard chow diet (No. 5001, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO, USA) or a ketogenic diet (5TJQ, TestDiet, composed of 15.6% calories from protein, 82.3% calories from fat, and 2.1% calories from carbohydrates). The fibrosis model was generated using intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)(2 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or thioacetamide (thioacetamide (TAA))(20 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) 2 times weekly for 6 or 10 weeks. The ketone bodies, including DL-β-hydroxybutyric acid (bHB)(300 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and acetoacetate (AcAc)(200 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), were intraperitoneally injected into mice 6 times weekly for 6 weeks. Each group’s liver tissues and serum were collected at the end of the experiments.",3cede89f-2e07-4663-9a4c-ec5337aff1d6
1,methods1," All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taipei Medical University (LAC-2020-0115, approved May 2020).  4.2. Immunohistochemistry Staining and Blood Biochemical Parameters  Liver tissues were fixed with 10% formalin and the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathological examination. To assess the extent of fibrosis, Sirius red staining (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and Masson’s Trichrome staining (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) were carried out following the manufacturer’s instructions. For immunohistochemistry staining of F4/80, liver sections were incubated with antibodies against F4/80 (1:200; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) and detected by using the Universal LSABTM2 kit (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA, USA). All sections were investigated by a light microscope (Olympus CKX41, Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan).",3ef8027c-d03e-4dc9-a57f-743972851654

8,methods8," The Mann–Whitney U-test was used to compare 2 independent groups. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.  5. Conclusions  Our study provides experimental evidence to support that a high-fat ketogenic diet increased the cholesterol quantity in the liver which further promoted CCl4- and thioacetamide (TAA)- induced fibrotic marker expression, liver inflammation, and the loss of antioxidant and detoxification ability (Figure 7). Furthermore, ketone body (bHB and AcAc) treatment did not influence hepatic stellate cell activation and the severity of liver fibrosis in vivo. Taken together, these results indicate that a high-fat ketogenic diet augments the severity of liver fibrosis in mice.
