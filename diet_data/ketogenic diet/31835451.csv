0,introduction0,"Glioblastoma (Glioblastoma (GBM)) is a very poor prognosis brain tumor, with a median survival of 16 months after treatment with temozolomide (temozolomide (TMZ)), bevacizumab (Bev), a vascular endothelial growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) inhibitor, and radiation1. Several new treatments have been developed, but the prognosis of Glioblastoma (GBM) remains poor2,3. Therefore, developing new treatment methods is urgent. Tumor cells take in a large amount of glucose and synthesize not only ATPs but also nucleic acids and fatty acids for cell maintenance4. Different from normal cells, the glycolytic pathway develops in an aerobic state and takes a metabolic form that is suppressed to the TCA cycle and electron transport system4. This is called the Warburg effect5. Among the treatments that take into account the Warburg effect, ketogenic diet (KD) therapy is emerging as a viable complementary therapeutic strategy for Glioblastoma (GBM)s.",c396214e-3c14-41b9-a634-0e091c729d69
1,introduction1,"  KD is a high fat and low carbohydrate diet that produces ketone bodies through imitation of starvation. In 1921, KD was developed to treat epilepsy6. KD induces ketone bodies that are transported to many organs including brain, metabolized in the mitochondria, and used as an energy source instead of glucose. Especially for the brain, it is the only energy source when glucose is depleted. However, since tumor cells depend on glucose as an energy source, it is thought that ketone bodies cannot be used. Glioma cells are reported to be incapable of compensating for glucose restriction by metabolizing ketone bodies7,8. Due to the ""metabolic inflexibility"" of glioma, KD is attracting attention as an adjuvant treatment for glioma.  There are reports on the anti-tumor effect of KD on tumor cells, but its efficacy has not yet been clarified. Zhou and Seyfried reported that an intracerebral glioma mouse model had longer survival under a calorie-restricted KD9,10. And Poff et al.",d61165fe-53df-4707-bc3f-b9489cf24d0f
2,introduction2," reported KD decreased blood glucose, slowed tumor growth, and increased mean survival time in mice with systemic metastatic cancer11. Feyter et al. found no anti-tumor effect of KD on an RG2 and 9L glioma mouse model with the increase of transport and oxidation of ketone bodies12.  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly vascularized brain tumor and an attractive target for anti-angiogenic therapies13. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as a critical regulator of angiogenesis, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors are used in the treatment of newly or recurrent Glioblastoma (GBM)s. Administration of bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, significantly decreases global cerebral blood flow (cerebral blood flow (CBF)) with a potentially preferential decrease in tumor perfusion compared with normal brain tissue14. Keunen et al.",8e91f899-e049-4097-9864-a2fdd0d1f827
3,introduction3," reported that anti-angiogenic treatment leads to major vessel remodeling, resulting in reduced perfusion and an increase in hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment15. Since vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors reduce the blood flow of tumors and promote ischemic conditions, using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors in combination with a low-glucose KD further deprives glucose supply. Therefore, we analyzed the anti-tumor effect of combination therapy of KD and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor. ",642aae0d-4d89-4a4b-9e76-e7d2186dae95

13,results0,"Survival benefit by the combination of ketogenic diet and bevacizumab First, we examined the expression of the enzymes related to ketone metabolism in the brain and glioma (Fig. 1A). mRNA expression of OXCT1 and BDH1 was significantly lower in gliomas compared to normal brain (Fig. 1B). Immunostaining revealed a very low expression in Glioblastoma (GBM) (Supplementary Fig. S1A). These results were consistent with previous results8. Next, U87 cells were transplanted into the brains of mice and the effects of ketogenic diet were examined. Mice treated with the ketogenic diet did not significantly prolong survival compared to mice treated with the normal diet (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor is known to reduce tumor blood supply15, therefore, we examined whether the combination of ketogenic diet and Bev therapy had an antitumor effect. The U87 cell implanted mice were divided into four treatment groups (Fig. 1C).",38c117b8-4404-4081-8fe5-268f1bd28c90
14,results1," In total, experiments were performed on 20 mice in each group. There was no significant difference in body weight and blood glucose levels between them (Supplementary Fig. S1C). However, the blood ketone level was markedly elevated in the KD and KD + Bev group, confirming that ketone was produced in the body (Supplementary Fig. S1C right). In the tumor growth, the KD alone did not show an anti-tumor effect compared to the control, however, the KD + Bev showed a significant decrease compared to the KD alone and a tendency to decrease compared to the control and Bev alone (Fig. 1D). In addition, the survival time of KD + Bev was significantly prolonged compared to all other groups (vs control, KD: p < 0.01, vs Bev: p = 0.025) (Fig. 1E). These results show that the combination of KD and Bev have significant anti-tumor effect and survival benefit.Figure 1 (A) Metabolic pathway of glucose, ketone body, and amino acid.",0b8e262d-155e-4b72-9f64-3163eba5c8bf

18,results5," In particular, the change in aspartic acid is most significant (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and Tukey–Kramer test).    Metabolic changes in the amino acids by ketogenic diet and bevacizumab In tumor tissues, several amino acids increased in KD and decreased in KD + Bev (Fig. 2E). Aspartic acid increased markedly in the KD group compared to the control, and decreased significantly in the Bev and KD + Bev groups. The KD + Bev group had significantly lower glutamic acid, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, and tryptophan than the KD group (Fig. 2E). Surprisingly, there were no amino acids that were significantly different between the Bev group and the KD + Bev group. In the normal brain, the pattern of changes for most amino acids are similar between tumor and brain tissues. For example, the KD increased the levels of tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine and proline in tumor tissues as well as brain tissues and so on (Supplementary Fig.",fff4b5a8-88e9-4843-9c01-0f6932f51366

On the other hand, cysteine, glycine, isoleucine, lysine, proline, and tyrosine of the brain were almost the same changes as the tumor. These results suggest that aspartic acid and glutamic acid may be important metabolites of the tumor under the KD.  Changes of metabolites and mRNA expression of the TCA cycle and glycolysis In the tumor tissue, the lactic acid of KD + Bev was significantly increased and fumaric acid and malic acid of KD + Bev were significantly decreases compared with KD (Fig. 3A) In addition, 2-ketoglutartic acid tended to increase in the KD + Bev group. On the other hand, in the normal brain, there was no significant difference in lactic acid between the groups (Fig. 3B).

We examined the mRNA expression levels of the TCA cycle and glycolysis-related enzymes in tumor using the microarray analysis (Supple. Table S3). However, there was no difference in TCA cycle between the treatment groups (Fig. 3C).

24,discussion0,"The effects of KD on Glioblastoma (GBM) are controversial12. However, many reports demonstrated the effect of calorie restricted KD therapy9, suggesting that stronger starvation is necessary. Therefore, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors that render tumors ischemic may be useful in promoting the anti-tumor effects of KD. In this study, we showed the utility of a combination of KD and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in a mouse model. Bevacizumab is a drug used for the standard treatment of Glioblastoma (GBM). It suppresses angiogenesis and blood flow in tumors and normalizes tumor blood vessels14–16. Bevacizumab had no effect on survival with radiation-temozolomide therapy, the basic Glioblastoma (GBM) treatment. The reason for this is unknown, but it appears that bevacizumab has no cytotoxic effect.",be98df06-6afd-4fbf-9eb2-1b2150ca8deb
25,discussion1," However, when bevacizumab is administered, contrast enhancement in the tumor is reduced and calcification is often caused, so dynamic changes occur in the tumor. Rieger et al. conducted a pilot study of KD in patients with recurrent glioblastoma, and the tumor shrinkage was good with the concomitant use of bevacizumab17.  To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of metabolome analysis in the brain and tumors following KD plus Bev therapy. Artzi et al. showed in proton magnetic-resonance-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of patients with low-grade glioma, the levels glutamine and glutamate in tumor were increased after treatment with KD alone18. In our metabolome analysis, we observed reduction of threonine, valine, isoleucine, leucine levels in glioma tissue of the groups Bev and KD + Bev. Similarly, Aminzadeh-Gohari et al.",0286873e-e5be-492b-95c0-0dd2849c6350
26,discussion2," also reported decreased level of most essential amino acids (essential amino acid (EAA)s) in plasma and neuroblastoma tumor tissues upon the treatment of the KD in combination with chemotherapy19. Furthermore, the combination of the KD and chemotherapy also reduced tumor blood-vessel density and intratumoral hemorrhage in neuroblastoma xenografts19. There are a total of nine amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine) that are essential in human bodies. Compared with their normal tissues, tumor cells frequently exhibit an increased demand for essential amino acid (EAA)s. Yue et al. showed oncogenic MYC promotes SLC7A5/SLC43A1-mediated essential amino acid (essential amino acid (EAA)) uptake20.  On the other hand, KD showed a significant increase in the levels of tryptophan, phenylalanine, pyruvate + oxaloacetate and malic acid in normal brain tissue compared to the control diet.",fe0f5c31-98cd-4ff1-8a3e-e603a9afb9e5
27,discussion3," These showed similar changes in glioma tissue. Interestingly, however, aspartic acid was significantly elevated by KD in glioma tissue, but not in normal brain tissue at all. In addition, aspartic acid, which is significantly increased by KD in glioma tissues, was not increased by KD + Bev. Aspartic acid, one of the non-essential amino acid (EAA)s, plays an important role in the TCA cycle, ornithine cycle, and biosynthesis of nucleic acids21. Aspartic acid is a precursor for asparagine, isoleucine, methionine, lysine, threonine, pyrimidines, NAD, and pantothenate; a nitrogen donor for arginine and purine synthesis; and an important metabolic effector22. Aspartic acid is easily converted into oxaloacetate and is used for gluconeogenesis. In addition, aspartic acid is not only important as a component of the urea cycle, but also involved in the entry and exit of substances from mitochondria (malic acid-aspartate shuttle).",5a910900-c452-41f5-8bea-ee5a063b9e11
28,discussion4," Mitochondrial aspartate export is essential for de novo nucleotide synthesis23.  There are few studies of metabolome analysis of tumors after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. The study conducted by Fack et al. showed metabolites associated with the TCA cycle were significantly reduced in both the tumor and brain when bevacizumab was administered24. However, in our experiments, treatment with bevacizumab alone did not show a significant reduction in TCA cycle-related metabolites. These differences may have been due to variations in the transplanted cells.  There are several reports of other treatments used in combination with KD in glioma therapy. In a study of the combination of KD and radiation therapy, the combination therapy significantly increased the survival time of mice25. There are also reports that anti-tumor effects have been observed with the combined use of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) and hyperbaric oxygen therapy11,26.",1ae5ffec-7b81-4a33-b342-ede280cea536
29,discussion5," It was recently reported that a combination of calorie-restricted KD and glutamine-targeted therapy was effective27. There are several human clinical studies in KD, but high-quality evidence on the effect of KD on tumor and QoL is currently lacking in glioma patients. Martin-McGill et al. conducted a randomized pilot study to investigate the use of KD as an adjuvant therapy for patients with Glioblastoma (GBM) (NCT03075514). Woodhouse et al. showed that modified Atkins diet, less stringent version of KD, was feasible and safe for glioma patients during radiation and chemotherapy treatment. Several clinical studies of KD in combination with radiation and temozolomide (NCT03278249, NCT03451799) are ongoing. however, there is no study of KD in combination with Bev. From our result, clinical study of KD plus Bev is necessary to evaluate the effect of glioblastoma patients.  There are several limitations to this study. Only one type of U87 cell was analyzed.",f21842fe-1dc7-48b8-a7e8-f47774bad1e5
30,discussion6," Although U87 cells are widely used in glioblastoma research, the metabolism of tumors varies. Research using other glioblastoma cells may be necessary in the future. Second, the metabolome analysis used the GC–MS only and the number of metabolites that was identified was limited. A combination of metabolome analysis, such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS), may elucidate in more detail the metabolic changes in KD + Bev therapy.  In conclusion, the KD enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of Bev in a glioblastoma intracranial implantation mouse model, based on lowest levels of cellular proliferation markers (Ki67 and CCND1) in Beb + KD-tumors compared to the other groups. Since both anti-angiogenic therapy and KD are used in clinical settings and their safety has been confirmed, combination therapy is feasible. Clinical trials using this combination should be conducted in the future. ",53041ece-a9aa-4905-a9bc-d92a4a4e2f5a
