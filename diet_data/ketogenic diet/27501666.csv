0,introduction0,"Metabolomic profiling is a semi-quantitative, unbiased analysis that looks at perturbations in metabolism. Metabolomics can be used for the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) enabling the simultaneous analysis of ~800 metabolites (amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids, neurotransmitters, nucleotides, cofactors and vitamins, bile acids, and other molecules <1,000 Da in molecular weight) within a single analysis [1]. Moreover, it is emerging as a powerful tool to understand small molecule perturbations occurring because of an enzyme defect and the relationship to the disease pathogenesis [2,3].  GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-DS) is an autosomal dominant, treatable neurological disorder due to a deficiency of glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) with an estimated frequency at approximately 1: 83,000 [4]. The GLUT1 transporter is encoded by the solute carrier family 2 member 1 (SLC2A1) gene and SLC2A1 heterozygous pathogenic mutations cause GLUT1-DS.",71a325f5-a26b-403b-aad0-ec14da1d2588
1,introduction1," GLUT1 specifically transports glucose across the blood-brain barrier; only five percent of glucose is transported across the blood-brain barrier by passive diffusion [5]. Deficiency of GLUT1 results in hypoglycorrhachia and impairment of cerebral metabolism. Neurons in the superficial layers of cerebral cortex and hippocampus followed by neurons in basal ganglia and thalamus are primarily affected by lack of glucose. Hypoglycemia-induced neuronal death is not a direct result of energy failure but involves additional mechanisms such as glutamate neurotoxicity or toxic levels of aspartate and/or adenosine [5–7].  Untreated GLUT1-DS has a broad clinical presentation comprising intellectual disability, movement disorder, acquired microcephaly and seizures. Recently, dominant SLC2A1 mutations were found in various forms of epilepsy, including genetic generalized epilepsy (genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE)).",271c83fe-666a-4d12-8713-255e5bd47046
2,introduction2," In clinical practice, the clinically available distinctive biomarker for GLUT1-DS is a low concentration of glucose in cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) (<50 mg/dl or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-to-blood glucose ratio <0.60). Early diagnosis is critical for an effective etiological therapy.  Among IEMs, GLUT1-DS is unique because it is treatable and earlier treatment results in a better prognosis. However, it is not routinely tested by newborn screening. GLUT1-DS treatment is based on ketogenic diet (KD), an isocaloric, high fat, low-carbohydrate diet inducing production of ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) mimicking the biochemical changes occurring in periods of fasting. KD is also used as adjuvant therapy in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy [6, 7]. The diet consists of 3–4 g of fat to every 1 g of carbohydrate and protein combined (classic 3:1 or 4:1 KD).",5b3bee50-709a-468e-9e4d-d5c94ed330b8
3,introduction3," Although KD is the first choice of treatment for GLUT1-DS, in about 20% of patients, this diet can lose its effectiveness over time [7]. Further studies on pathophysiological mechanisms of KD are needed to develop novel therapeutic strategies.  In this study, we describe the identification of biomarkers associated with GLUT1-DS plus KD. We initially performed ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on a single cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample from a subject diagnosed with GLUT1-DS and performed subsequent analyses on subjects diagnosed with GLUT1-DS and using KD intervention. Due to timing of metabolomics platform advancements, two different configurations were used, but consistent biochemical alterations were identified between the methods that aligned with the changes in phenotype and clinical appearance of the patients. To our knowledge, this is the first application of metabolomics in patients diagnosed with GLUT1-DS.",55783910-9f18-4b54-91a7-0fe276a6fa2f

Global metabolomic profiling Metabolomic profiling was performed by Baylor Genetics Laboratories (Houston, TX) and Metabolon, Inc (Durham, NC) as described previously [1,9,10] for plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using two different platform configurations. For the both configurations, small molecules were extracted from 100 of ul of sample in an 80% methanol solution.  The first platform configuration consisted of four chromatographic analyses: GC-MS, LC-MS/MS in positive mode (LCMS Pos), LC-MS/MS in negative mode (LCMS Neg), and a LC-MS/MS Polar method (LCMS Pol).",23f98420-6c8e-468e-a020-32c9a98bbf12
8,introduction9," GC-MS was performed on bistrimethyl-silyl-trifluoroacetamide derivatized analytes using a Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo-Finnigan). For LC/MS Neg and LCMS Pos methods, chromatographic separation was completed using an ACQUITY UPLC (Waters) equipped with a Waters BEH C18 column followed by analysis with an Orbitrap Elite high resolution mass spectrometer (Thermo-Finnigan).  The second configuration utilized the same mass spectrometry methods but utilized the following chromatographic methods: LCMS Neg (same as the previous configuration), LCMS Pol (same as previous configuration), and LCMS positive ion method focusing on lipophilic compounds (LCMS Pos Lipid) and LCMS positive ion method focusing on polar compounds (LCMS Pos Polar).",a98a6555-3f2e-46d3-8d90-5e6f62e47677
9,introduction10," In both configurations, metabolites were identified with known chemical structure by matching the ions’ chromatographic retention index, accurate mass, and mass spectral fragmentation signatures with reference library entries created from authentic standard metabolites under the identical analytical procedure as the experimental samples [11]. Currently, the reference library contains entries for ~2500 unique human metabolites.  Semi-quantitative analysis was achieved by comparing patient samples to a set of invariant anchor specimen included in each batch. Raw spectral intensity values were normalized to the anchor samples log transformed and compared to a normal reference population to generate z-score values. The reference population was a pediatric, randomly sampled population that was matched for age, diet and gender for this comparison. Rare compounds are those analytes detected in the patient specimen but only rarely seen in the reference population (<5% of all patients tested).",a3db85ac-7a56-4cb6-8c7b-fb125af2edba
10,introduction11," Median raw intensity values were calculated for all analytes identified in ≥2/3 of the anchor specimen and these median values were then used to normalize corresponding analyte raw intensity values in patient specimen. Analytes not identified in 2/3 or more of the anchor specimens were excluded from analysis. Anchor adjusted analyte values were scaled to the median anchor adjusted analyte values of all previous specimens analyzed to date, missing values were imputed using the minimum detected value and the data were log-transformed. Data collected from samples were normalized to creatinine. Z-scores were calculated using the mean and standard deviation of the entire median-scaled log-transformed dataset.

21,discussion0,"Reduced brain glucose transport associated with GLUT1 lowered activity or deficiency is the hallmark of GLUT1-DS. Metabolomic profiling, the systematic study of small-molecule products of biochemical pathways has been used to predict diagnosis and monitor different metabolic disorders [1,3,12–15]. We applied an untargeted metabolomics profiling approach on both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from GLUT1-DS patients toward unraveling metabolic mechanisms and biomarkers implicated in this disorder.  Currently, the routine diagnostic tools in clinical use for GLUT1-DS are low glucose in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose to blood glucose ratio. Glucose values can vary depending on age [16–18], and screening for glucose levels versus a pediatric-matched population can identify perturbations in metabolites, such as carbohydrate metabolism, to identify signatures of disease (Table 2).",e358deb1-5be6-4fe7-8a2c-c8479c984a6b
22,discussion1," The metabolomics approach in three cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of GLUT1-DS not on ketogenic diet patients was applied to achieve a more comprehensive mirror of glucose-dependent pathways in the brain. In the analysis of the initial sample, we identified significantly decreased levels of glucose, fructose, and mannose with elevated levels of inosine and glutamine (Fig 1). The analysis of two subsequent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples revealed decreased levels of most tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, elevated isocitrate, and decreased glycerol-3-phosphate (Table 2). The differences in biochemicals detected on the two platforms can be attributed to the different chromatography components of each platform; version 1 contained one LC/MS pos method and version 2 contained two LC/MS pos methods. Increased isocitrate levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may reflect low enzyme activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase, a NADP+-consuming enzyme.",f18a8c1f-9eef-4cc3-a56b-9c1343b471d2
23,discussion2," Glycerol-3-phosphate has a role in intermediary metabolism in the regulation of glucose lipid and energy metabolism [19–22] and a work in a GLUT1-DS mouse model revealed diminished cerebral lipid synthesis in these mice [23,24]. Isocitrate and glycerol-3-phosphate are known to play roles in cellular energetics and their biochemicals, or a ratio of them given they change in opposite directions, may be biomarkers of disease.  Energy failure has been proved in GLUT1-DS astrocytes [24]. tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolites are globally reduced in GLUT1-DS patients and succinylcarnitine (C4) which arises from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA [25] was significantly lower in our cohort (Table 7). Energy impairment is also supported by the recently proved clinical therapeutic efficacy in GLUT1-DS of triheptanoin which is a dietary supplement that replenishes key substrates to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the brain [26].",52214563-15f5-4745-a70a-1428439d3dd5
24,discussion3," We detected 2-aminoheptanoate at significantly higher levels in GLUT1-DS patients (average z-score = 1.4411, p<0.01). Heptanoate, a direct product of triheptanoin metabolism, can easily cross the blood-brain barrier via monocarboxylate transporters and enhance the effect of ketones as fuel to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the brain [27, 28]. Specifically, 2-aminoheptanoate can be metabolized to two molecules of acetyl-CoA and one molecule of propionyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA then can be metabolized to succinyl-CoA, an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. We speculate that high 2-aminoheptanoate in GLUT1-DS patients might be a compensatory neurochemical mechanism for recovering energy homeostasis induced by ketone bodies.  The KD induced differences in plasma biochemical profiles in lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid related compounds (Tables 3 and 4).",6fb07424-e602-477b-937d-87ee2e7f3479
25,discussion4," The type of KD can differ in fatty acid content and composition, thereby affecting the levels of free fatty acids in the bloodstream [29]. Within the lipid superfamily, long-chain fatty acids, phospholipids, acylcarnitines, and sphingolipids showed significant perturbations. Medium-chain fatty acids such as octanoic acid and decanoic acid acids have been found to be elevated in the plasma of GLUT1-DS patients on KD [30]. Decanoate showed no changes in our subjects diagnosed with GLUT1-DS, and octanoate showed reduced levels in subjects diagnosed with GLUT1-DS (S2 Table). This profile suggests the KD consumed by these subjects did not contain medium chain triglycerides. Klepper et al. analyzed essential fatty acid levels in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 18 GLUT1-deficient patients consuming a ketogenic diet and revealed their respective levels versus control patients could be maintained over the course of several months [31].",121bd1bc-dd68-49ea-b018-d7234712a831
26,discussion5,"  Low to normal blood glucose levels in GLUT1-DS have been reported [32]. In our cohort, all GLUT1-DS patients showed significantly lower levels of different carbohydrate compounds; the most significant were those of maltose, sucrose, lactose, glucose, and mannitol/sorbitol (Table 4). Previous reports have suggested that a KD may decrease blood glucose level [33,34].  The brain can utilize ketones as a source of energy in the presence of low levels or absence of glucose. Ketones can be ingested through diet and produced through the metabolism of lipids. Because of this, ketone levels vary according to the dietary regimen, energy balance, physical activities and long-term side effects (e.g. elevated blood lipids, growth retardation) [7].",02a88f31-c03e-47e7-b390-e90543ea57ce
27,discussion6," The neuroprotective effects of ketone bodies rely on alternative brain energy fuel recovery in lipid biosynthesis and influence on neuronal excitability [35,36], although the exact mechanism(s) of action of KD along with biochemical changes that are KD-related are still unknown, and KD is not fully effective in all GLUT1-DS patients [7]. Marin-Valencia et al. showed GLUT1-DS mice had elevated plasma fatty acids and ketone bodies [23]. Although glucose is the main energy source for neurons, cells can also utilize ketones, lactate, pyruvate, glycerol and some amino acids as alternative substrates [37]. Brain amino acids such as glutamate, glutamine, GABA, adenosine, pyruvate and aspartate were preserved in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of GLUT1-DS in line with other reports [23]. Specific KD metabolites include BHBA and 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine, as reflected in the plasma from 6 patients with GLUT1-DS on KD.",3798034d-2a1b-4763-a288-6dd335c2648a
28,discussion7," Other potential KD-associated metabolites may include: N-acetylglycine, 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, nonadecanoate, alpha-ketobutyrate, 3-hydroxylaurate, 10-nonadecenoate, margarate, 15-methylpalmitate and 2-aminoheptanoate since they showed significant high values in our KD patients. In addition to dietary intervention with a ketogenic diet, plasma from subjects in a fasted state will have elevated ketone bodies and elevated free fatty acids, but the patients in this study were randomly samples and thus, did not have blood taken during a fasted state. Margarate influences the fatty acid network involving nonadecanoate, palmitate and heptadecenoate [38]. 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine can be used as plasma biomarkers for personalized monitoring of individuals and for optimization of their diet.  L-carnitine regulates the flux substrate and energy balance across cell membranes by modulating the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria [39,40].",1f2aa1d0-ac1c-4dfa-a3a7-e9ab73a29697
29,discussion8," Free carnitine levels were significantly lower in GLUT1-DS patients on KD (p = 0.01) (Table 6, Fig 2A and 2B) consistent with those results obtained by other who have examined gradual carnitine depletion with long-term KD treatment [39]. The overall profiles in Table 3 and Table 7 are indicative of the consumption of carnitine and the metabolism of fatty acids through β-oxidation. Ketosis induces chronic formation of acyl-carnitine derivatives causing a dip of free carnitine [39,41,42]. Carnitine deficiency will impair oxidation of fatty acids and ketone production [39]. However, the need for carnitine supplementation in patients on KD remains controversial [39,41]. Based on our results and the low risk associated with L-carnitine supplementation, we suggest oral supplementation with carnitine for GLUT1-DS patients on KD for dietary intervention with a starting dose of 10–50 mg/kg per day [41].",a4d8b3ce-2884-4e1c-ae14-7f77214ff905
30,discussion9,"  The present study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate metabolomics perturbation in GLUT1-DS patients. The emerging application of metabolomics in clinical practice could contribute to an informative diagnosis and may provide insights into the pathomechanisms of IEMs, potentially broadening therapeutic choices, as those identified in the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from subjects diagnosed with GLUT1-DS. Overall, metabolomics has revealed multiple dysregulated metabolites in several pathways in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of patients diagnosed with GLUT1-DS.
