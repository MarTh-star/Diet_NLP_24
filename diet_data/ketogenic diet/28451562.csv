0,background0,"Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers and affects about one in eight women during their lifetime [1]. In general, modern BC therapy includes different therapeutic approaches, such as surgical removal of the tumor, chemotherapy, radiation, and hormone therapy [2]. In addition to these conventional therapies, a large number of patients seek supportive therapies like specific diets to improve their outcome. The correlation between different types of diet and the incidence and progression of cancer is increasingly becoming the focus of research [3–7]. In this respect, avoiding carbohydrates to specifically “starve cancer cells” is the most popular trend amongst “cancer diets.” The rationale for this dietary regime is often based on the “Warburg effect,” which describes the preferential fermentation of glucose to lactate even under availability of sufficient oxygen [8, 9].",404e385b-04bb-4b77-8c6d-44bbb2771cf5
1,background1," Therefore, reducing carbohydrate intake and thus lowering blood glucose seems to be a promising strategy for cutting cancer off from glucose supply [10–12].  Besides fasting, the strictest form of such a “very low carb” diet is called the ketogenic diet (KD). The KD is characterized by consuming the predominant proportion of calories from fat, balancing those derived from protein and thus consuming very few calories from glucose or other carbohydrates. Different KD regimens were shown to be safe and well tolerated in a variety of malignancies [13–19] and lead to the metabolic state of a physiological ketosis [20]. During ketosis, the “ketone bodies” acetoacetate (AcAc) and D-β-hydroxybutyrate (R-3-hydroxybutyrate: 3-OHB) are predominantly produced in the liver and can be detected in the peripheral blood and urine above normal levels [21]. 3-OHB is found at similar or higher concentrations than AcAc and therefore, considered the principal “ketone body.",d5bab5d6-8a74-4680-8a57-963d502a9372
2,background2,"” In humans, the median concentration of 3-OHB in plasma reaches approximately 3 mM under short-term fasting conditions [22], up to 6 mM during long-term starvation [23] and regularly at least 2 mM under a ketogenic diet [24].  3-OHB is transported into cells via monocarboxylic acid transporters (monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)). The isoforms monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)1, monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)2, and monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)4 can transport lactate and ketone bodies across the cell membrane [25, 26]. Here, monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)2 has the highest affinity for 3-OHB, whereas monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)1 and 4 have a higher affinity for lactate [27, 28]. In mitochondria, 3-OHB is degraded via ketolysis into acetyl-CoA, which then is metabolized within the Krebs cycle and the respiratory chain to generate energy [29–32].",be10dc32-9605-4238-93f4-e6614783e795
3,background3," Since the oxidation of 3-OHB generates more energy per mol oxygen used compared to glucose, it is sometimes labeled a “superfuel” [33]. However, cells need functioning mitochondria as well as sufficient oxygen supply to generate energy from 3-OHB. The latter is hampered in the hypoxic microenvironment of larger tumors, which has already been shown in vivo for breast cancer tissue in patients [34].  There are somewhat contradicting results regarding the effect of 3-OHB on growth and biology of tumor cells cultured in vitro and in experimental tumors in mice. In some studies, ketone bodies seem to be associated with cancer progression, metastasis, and poor clinical outcome [35, 36]. In contrast, it was shown that a ketogenic diet significantly reduces tumor growth in mice [37, 38]. Further, an antiproliferative effect of 3-OHB was already shown for different cancer cells, such as glioblastoma and tumor stem cells [37], melanoma, cervical carcinoma, or neuroblastoma [39–41].",cd84abce-6073-4c51-b771-a19bcd1923bf
4,background4," Several studies also described a significant delay of tumor growth in mice and humans in a systemic ketosis [16, 18, 37, 38, 40, 42–49]. In this respect, Rodrigues and coworkers reported evidence for a “β-hydroxybutyrate paradox” [50]. They postulated that the effect of 3-OHB on cancer growth would depend on the tumor’s energetic phenotype. Thus, “oxidative cells” would use 3-OHB as an additional energy source so that tumors with predominantly “oxidative cells” increase their growth when this metabolite is available. Other cells with a more “glycolytic, Warburg-like phenotype” would be unable to metabolize 3-OHB in which case it could accumulate intracellularly and inhibit tumor growth via signaling and epigenetic mechanisms [50].  In view of this preclinical pro- and contra evidence and the fact that increasing numbers of patients are adopting a ketogenic diet or short-term fasting during oncological therapy, we studied the impact of 3-OHB on seven different BC cell lines in vitro.",4d6b9472-8394-49bb-99b2-20d547dc8015
5,background5," Here, we initially analyzed the energetic profile of these cells and correlated this to the effect of 3-OHB on cell proliferation. Further, we investigated the possibility of synergism between ketosis and radio- or chemotherapy [51]. To mimic a physiological state of metabolites found in the circulation of patients performing a KD, we performed experiments with 3 mM 3-OHB, representing pronounced ketosis, and 5 mM glucose, typical for the blood glucose level found in persons on a KD (range 4.9–5.2 mM) [19, 52–57]. Furthermore, we investigated cells at both an oxygen supply of 5% oxygen (= 5 kPA), a typical mean concentration between well-vascularized benign breast tissue (6.5 kPA) and non-hypoxic tumor regions (3.2–4.7 kPA) in vivo [58] and 21% oxygen (21 kPA), as a common condition used in cell culture.

Thus in general, no direct correlation between the metabolic reaction to 3-OHB and the basal energetic phenotype of the cell lines was seen.

We observed an overall decrease in expression of all three enzymes in MCF7 and MDA-MB 231 cells with further decrease (MCF7) or a moderate increase of BDH1 and acetyl CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT) in the presence of 3-OHB. All enzymes were downregulated in HBL100 and MCF7 cells, but and only BDH1 and acetyl CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT) in MDA-MB 231 cells in response to low oxygen (5% oxygen). This regulation was not observed in BT20, BT474, MDA-MB 468, and T47D. In summary, the data show no strong correlation between mRNA overexpression and consumption of 3-OHB or oxygen concentration.Fig. 3 a The columns show the amount of 3-OHB (in mM) consumed by the cells normalized to their cell number as given by optical density (OD) measured with the crystal violet assay.",ecdfc67b-fc07-4085-848f-954b511f151e

There was also no significant difference in the concentration of 3-OHB remaining in the medium after incubation with cells at 5 or 21% oxygen (Fig. 3a). By Western blot analysis (Fig. 3c), we showed that monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)2, the key transporter for 3-OHB into cells [27], was expressed highly by all seven cell lines. In particular, monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)2 expression was higher at mild hypoxia in the majority of cell lines. Therefore, the transport of 3-OHB across the plasma membrane seems not to be a limiting factor for 3-OHB consumption by BC cells.",407519d4-a210-42a3-bdc6-d0f07d8defec
30,results9," glucose transporter (GLUT)1 as a key transporter for glucose into tumor cells was detected in all cell lines, and its expression was not influenced by 3-OHB (Fig. 3c). Together, our results demonstrate that 3-OHB does not significantly change the expression of ketolytic enzymes or of the transporter molecules monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)2 and glucose transporter (GLUT)1. Nevertheless, BC cell lines show marked differences in their ability to deplete 3-OHB from the medium indicating that mRNA expression patterns of ketolytic enzymes were not associated with consumption rate of 3-OHB.  Short-term and long-term cell proliferation of breast cancer cells is not affected by incubation with 3-OHB To analyze whether 3-OHB can affect cancer cell proliferation independent of their metabolic phenotype, we incubated the BC cell lines with 5 mM glucose, with and without addition of 3 mM 3-OHB in the presence of 5 or 21% oxygen, respectively.",86aed330-80b1-4bc4-a3f5-007d48d56e47

Since AcAc, the second ketone body which rises in circulation upon a ketogenic diet, was described to increase proliferation in BRAF V600E melanoma cells [73], we performed cell proliferation assays in the presence of this metabolite over 5 days in parallel to the 3-OHB experiments. As shown in the Additional file 1, there was no significant effect of AcAc on the proliferation rate of the BC cell lines tested. A slight increase in proliferation of BT20 cells at 5% oxygen concentration did not reach statistical significance.

We therefore exposed the BC cell lines to epirubicin, paclitaxel, or carboplatin, three chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in breast cancer treatment. Here, we did not find any significant influence of 3-OHB on the effect of these drugs on cancer cell viability at either 5 or 21% oxygen (Fig. 5a and Additional file 2).

38,discussion0,"In this study, we have shown that beta-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB), the main ketone body found in the circulation after fasting or ketogenic diets (KDs), was able to change the energetic phenotype of BT20 breast cancer cells when applied at physiological concentrations of 3 mM. However, this effect of 3-OHB on energy metabolism was not observed in any of the other BC cell lines investigated herein. Moreover, 3-OHB did not interfere with turnover of glucose and lactate and neither significantly affected short- and long-term cancer cell proliferation, or their sensitivity to chemotherapy or ionizing radiation in any of the cell lines tested. This implies that 3-OHB at a physiological concentration of 3 mM seems to be inert in affecting energetic processes essential for proliferation or cell survival in the tested BC cell lines in vitro.",043c08b4-f6fe-42f6-9c82-fcbd6de56db8
39,discussion1," In addition, we found that AcAc, the second ketone body elevated under a KD, also did not significantly influence proliferation of any BC cell line measured over 5 days. While preclinical data have shown that AcAc promotes proliferation of BRAF-V600-positive melanoma cells [73], it is interesting that in a pilot study [13] it was a patient with BRAF V600E-positive/BRAF-inhibitor-resistant melanoma who responded favorably to a KD; this highlights the limitations of translating preclinical study results to humans.  This research was performed, since a possible influence of 3-OHB on cancer growth has gained substantial interest over the past years. In particular, different regimes for KDs are currently investigated in several clinical trials to improve the outcome for cancer patients [74].",281b6001-77c2-4527-a3d0-4d26af603a91
40,discussion2," Several reports indicate a significant benefit of ketosis and especially 3-OHB on slowing cancer progression in different preclinical cancer models and patients [13, 37, 42, 44, 49, 75–77], amongst them one recent case study successfully applying a KD as part of a multimodal pro-oxidative therapy in a stage IV triple-negative breast cancer patient [78]. On the other hand, there are other publications describing a negative impact of ketosis/3-OHB on tumor cell growth in vitro and in mouse models [35, 36, 79, 80].  Therefore, we initially analyzed the energetic profile of seven different BC cell lines using substrate turnover quantification and energetic flux analysis.",2a9a1bc4-642e-44f5-abf0-c05d30e8417c
41,discussion3," The basic energetic phenotypes differed somewhat from the results reported by Pelicano and coworkers [81], who found that triple-negative breast cancer (triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)) cell lines were in general characterized by a higher extracellular acidification rate (extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)) and lower oxygen consumption rate (oxygen consumption rate (OCR)) compared to hormone receptor positive cell lines [81]. For the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line BT20, we found an energetic profile that was low in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and was comparable to the hormone receptor positive T47D cell line. Furthermore, the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines MDA-MB 231 and MDA-MB 468 showed very similar energetic profiles in our experiments and those of Pelicano and colleagues.",c9f646b0-8ad4-4608-b8b8-bf31a299e277
42,discussion4," However, in the study of Pelicano and colleagues, both MDA-MB cell lines were very similar to the energetic phenotype of BT20 cells. In contrast, in our study, the BT20 cells showed a relatively low basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) compared to other triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines in our experiments. This more oxidative basal phenotype of the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB 468 was recently also shown by Lanning and colleagues, even at high glucose conditions of 10 mM [82]. However, this study also described a low oxidative phenotype for the MDA-MB 231 cell line which was remarkably lower than that of MDA-MB 468, while in our investigation, both cell lines showed comparable values of oxygen consumption rate (OCR). It is likely that these discrepancies between metabolic profiling data can arise from small differences in the culture conditions, for example different metabolite concentrations in fetal calf serum.",313c9395-9fb7-42d9-a0bf-2baf006a4337
43,discussion5," Nevertheless, we can conclude that under the experimental conditions used here, only BT20 cells shifted their metabolic profile upon exposure to reduced oxygen concentration. Those discrepancies between our and other metabolic profiling data could also be due to different expression profiles of the cell lines in different laboratories based on different subclones [83, 84].  Of note, our quotient of oxygen consumption rate (OCR)/extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) for BT20 had a range from 0.9–2.4 (not shown), which is closer to the original findings of Warburg, who found that the quotient of respiration to aerobic glycolysis was 0.3–0.9 in tumor tissue sections [8, 9]. Apart from BT20, the other BC cell lines remained relatively stable with respect to the oxygen consumption rate (OCR)/extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) ratio in the presence of 3-OHB.",565cd3a7-6507-450c-80ff-1b04b36ca064
44,discussion6,"  We found that 3-OHB increases both basic oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) after inhibition of ATP synthesis by oligomycin and in the presence of the uncoupling agent FCCP in BT20 cells. This indicates that 3-OHB alters mitochondrial capacity, for example, by increasing the expression/activity of respiratory complexes or by inducing mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, glycolysis was also increased after 3-OHB exposure, indicating an overall increase in metabolic activity of these cells (as displayed in Fig. 2a). However, this phenotype was not observed in the other breast cancer cell lines used in our study. One reason for this difference could be that BT20 is the only triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line that is mutant for BRCA2 (Table 1).",b4b65969-ba55-42e4-b41d-f2c5899ee974
45,discussion7," Indeed, a large-scale metabolomics study recently found that BT20 cells differ in their metabolic profile compared to other triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, based on unsupervised hierarchical clustering [85]. While further experimentation is required to identify the underlying mechanisms for the overall increase in metabolic activity caused by 3-OHB exposure in these cells, our data clearly show that 3-OHB does not affect the viability of BT20 cells or their response to chemotherapy or radiation, despite this metabolic effect. Notably, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) is not only dependent on medium acidification via lactic acid but can also be affected by the production of carbonic acid (H2CO3) as an end product of the oxidative degradation of metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid (tricarboxylic acid (TCA)) cycle [86, 87].",d24dec6b-45d5-4b52-bc75-b88f49149511
46,discussion8," Here, a very important aspect is the observation that breast cancer cell lines, and especially the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines, often use glutamine as a relevant nutrient to support their metabolic demands [88, 89]. Moreover, glutamine can also be converted to pyruvate and lactate by malic enzyme [90]. Since glutamine is not a limiting factor in our cell culture medium, we cannot exclude that the observed increase in extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) is due to glutamine metabolism in the cell lines investigated. Therefore, the increase in extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in parallel to elevated oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in BT20 cells is likely to correspond to a generally more “energetic phenotype” of enhanced respiration and CO2 or lactate-induced acidification [86, 87].",f9d93900-b2e5-4e28-bffa-6ae6ebd2f7cd
47,discussion9," Another possible interpretation would be mitochondrial uncoupling via overexpression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) that, although not evaluated in our study, has been shown to occur in BC cell lines [91]. UCP2 overexpression has a metabolic action by supporting glucose and glutamine fermentation at the expense of mitochondrial oxidation [92]. If mitochondrial uncoupling increased, then oxygen consumption would not strictly be linked to respiratory capacity.  Anyway, the shift to a more energetic phenotype seems not to correlate with the metabolism of 3-OHB as an energy source. As proven by RT-qPCR, the BT20 cells express very low levels of mRNA for BDH1, the key entry enzyme of ketolysis, and in line with this, consume only small amounts of 3-OHB. Of note, BT20 cells also displayed the highest basal rate of glucose consumption and lactic acid production of all cell lines tested and this rate was not influenced by 3-OHB at physiological concentrations.",9bb51a41-7e66-476a-bcd7-d61a6ac9f982
48,discussion10," Further, the proliferation rate of BT20 cells was unaffected by 3-OHB, similar to the other six cell lines tested.  Here, we found no evidence that 3-OHB fuels the metabolism of BC cells in vitro. This is in accordance to an in vivo study, which showed that 3-OHB did not influence growth of melanoma cells either when injected intraperitoneally or when elevated by a high-fat diet [73]. However, at the same time, it is in contrast to a previous study that has shown an increased growth of breast cancer xenografts derived from MDA-MB 231 cells when mice were injected with 3-OHB intraperitoneally [36]. In our in vitro experiments, the MDA-MB 231 cell line showed no increased proliferation in the presence of 3-OHB. Moreover, no notable inhibition of proliferation by 3-OHB could be seen in our short-term (5 days) and long-term (at least 14 days) experiments, as described for other cell lines [39–41].",c62fc492-170b-4531-8082-d3a366def190
49,discussion11," In this context, it should be noted that the growth inhibitory effects for 3-OHB previously reported were predominantly seen with very high and non-physiological concentrations of 3-OHB (5–40 mM), an observation we have seen in our cell lines as well (not shown). In detail, the first description of an antiproliferative effect of 3-OHB on different cancer cell lines was published by Magee et al. in 1979. The authors tested concentrations of 3-OHB between 10 and 40 mM [39]. In 2009, Skinner et al. described an effect of 3-OHB on the viability of human neuroblastoma cells. Again, the authors used very high concentrations of 3-OHB between 24 and 43 mM [41]. Interestingly, an antiproliferative effect of 3-OHB was also described for a physiological concentration of 5 mM 3-OHB in brain tumor cells, but at a very high glucose concentration of 25 mM that represents a more pathophysiological ketoacidotic situation [40].",1ea98ef4-8827-4664-9c23-a24f8aff7381
50,discussion12," Our intent was to investigate the effect of 3-OHB in vitro under conditions more likely to be found in cancer patients on KDs. That is why we used physiological concentration of 3-OHB (3 mM) and glucose (5 mM) [22–24]. Using cell culture conditions comparable to our experiments, Martuscelli described an antiproliferative effect of 3-OHB in glioblastoma cell lines and tumor stem cells with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2 mM 3-OHB in the presence of low (4 mM) and physiological (5–6 mM) glucose concentrations [37]. These contrary results described for the effect of 3-OHB on BC cells and glioma cells may reflect differences in their ability to consume 3-OHB.  Previous studies have shown variable gene expression levels of key enzymes involved in ketolytic metabolism in cancer cell lines of different entities [41, 93–97]. In line with these data, we found different mRNA expression patterns of ketolytic enzymes in BC cell lines.",af3f4fe6-b3da-4dc3-9feb-493374b0ec3b
51,discussion13," In BT474 and HBL100, mRNA transcripts for all ketolytic enzymes were detectable. This was associated with the highest relative consumption rate of 3-OHB by these cells. In contrast, the other BC cell lines failed to express increased levels of at least one of these key enzymes. This mRNA expression pattern was independent from the subtype of BC [59–61] (Table 1) and not influenced by 3-OHB. In accordance to the results of Antalis and colleagues [98], we found very low mRNA transcripts for acetyl CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT)1 for BDH1 in MCF-7 cells, which was linked to their inability to consume 3-OHB. Altogether, the expression of ketolytic enzymes on mRNA level seems not to be associated with the rate of 3-OHB consumption and unrelated to levels of glucose consumption and lactate production; however, we are aware, that mRNA expression did not allow to judge about enzymatic activity.",49adc407-38cb-4312-aa06-0fe5e53071ec
52,discussion14,"  Cells take up ketone bodies by monocarboxylate transporters (monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)s), a family of proton-linked plasma membrane transporters that carry ketone bodies across biological membranes. The most important transporter for 3-OHB into cancer cells is monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)2 [25, 99–101], and previous studies describe an overexpression of monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)2 in BC cells [102]. Here, we found a strong expression of monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)2 in all seven BC cell lines, so that the absence of 3-OHB effects in the cells cannot be explained by defective monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT) expression. Since the expression of glucose transporter (GLUT)1 was found to be related to poor prognosis in breast cancer [103, 104], we analyzed if its expression could be reduced by 3-OHB.",7a7eb7ea-03d8-48dc-b86d-692806a95758
53,discussion15," However, as for monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)2, we could not detect any modulation of the glucose transporter (GLUT)1 receptor expression in dependency of 3-OHB, an observation also described in cardiomyocytes [105].  The KD is increasing in popularity, and an increasing number of cancer patients are trying the KD simultaneously with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Recent clinical trials, e.g., NCT01419483, investigate safety and tolerance of a KD during combined chemotherapy and radiation. We analyzed the response of 3-OHB-treated BC cells to chemotherapy and radiation in vitro. No significant changes in the dose-response to three chemotherapeutical drugs most commonly used in BC treatment [106–110] were observed. Thus, the sensitizing effect of a ketogenic diet on radiochemotherapy in vivo [111] might be mediated by effects other than direct influences on cancer cells. In this context, the clinical study published by Klement and Sweeney [112] is of interest.",b167d6e8-a618-45e2-ae19-b8d68f1cab64
54,discussion16," The authors described an adequate tumor regression for a small cohort of cancer patients undergoing a KD and radiation therapy. Further, two mouse studies with glioma and lung cancer confirm the radio-sensitizing effect of a ketogenic diet [111, 113]. To date, no information is available on a possible radio-sensitizing effect of 3-OHB. Our in vitro results with 3 mM 3-OHB indicate a non-significant tendency of this ketone body to sensitize most BC cells to ionizing radiation.  Conclusions The intent of the study was to investigate the effect of 3-OHB on seven BC cell lines in vitro under conditions likely to be found in patients on a KD or short-term starvation. We have found strong evidence that a physiological concentration of 3 mM 3-OHB and AcAc did not impact cell proliferation and the response to standard BC chemotherapy and ionizing radiation is not changed by 3-OHB.",47a0456e-d2f7-4ddd-ba0f-c3115eb6a266
55,discussion17," These findings were independent from the diverse genetic background of the cell lines and differences in mRNA expression of ketolytic enzymes and 3-OHB uptake. Taken together, we found that 3-OHB at physiological concentrations has no major impact on BC cell proliferative behavior and the metabolic activity in vitro and especially does not fuel tumor cell growth. These results support clinical observations that physiologically increased 3-OHB serum concentrations induced either by a ketogenic diet or by short-term starvation do neither support nor inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation. Thus, a ketogenic diet should be safe for breast cancer patients as already described for patients with diverse cancer types (for review, see [114]).
