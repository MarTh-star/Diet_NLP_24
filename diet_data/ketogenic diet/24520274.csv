0,introduction0,"Hunger and satiety are two important mechanisms involved in body weight regulation. Even though humans can regulate food intake by will, there are systems within the central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)) that regulate food intake and energy expenditure. This complex network, whose control center is spread over different brain areas, receives information from adipose tissue, the gastrointestinal tract (gastrointestinal tract (GIT)), and from blood and peripheral sensory receptors. The actions of the brain's hunger/satiety centers are influenced by nutrients, hormones and other signaling molecules. Ketone bodies are the major source of energy in the periods of fasting and/or carbohydrate shortage and might play a role in food intake control.  Hypothalamic control of feeding/appetite/hunger Role of nutrients in food intake control The hypothalamus is the brain's main center responsible for hunger/satiety (H/S) control.",f20c4726-d1f7-4708-8644-517b2e01bf8e
1,introduction1," In the theory that Mayer proposed more than 60 years ago, he assigned a central role to glucose levels in the H/S control: the so-called “glucostatic theory” (Mayer, 1955). Mayer suggested that depletion of carbohydrate availability leads to hunger, and the hypothalamic centers with receptors sensitive to glucose levels might be involved in the short-term regulation of energy intake (Mayer, 1955). The “feeding center” in the lateral hypothalamic area (lateral hypothalamic area (LHA)), according to the glucostatic theory, reacts to the between-meal fall of blood glucose and stimulates food intake. The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) contains glucose-inhibited neurons that are stimulated by hypoglycemia, a process crucial to mediating the hyperphagia normally induced by hypoglycemia.",feedcb67-8d07-4460-8f32-98e65f9971b9
2,introduction2," The subsequent post-prandial hyperglycemia activates the “satiety center” in the ventromedial hypothalamus (ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH)), which contains glucose-excited neurons and inhibits both “feeding center” and food intake.  In 1953, Kennedy proposed the lipostatic hypothesis suggesting that lipid metabolites could also be involved in food regulation (Kennedy, 1953), and in 1956, Mellinkoff studied the effects of protein metabolism suggesting an aminostatic hypothesis .  Glucose-sensitive neurons have been identified in a number of central nervous system (CNS) regions including the metabolic control centers of the hypothalamus. Medeiros et. al. have used patch-clamp electrophysiology to examine whether neurons in a specific specialized region known as the subfornical organ (subfornical organ (SFO)), an area where the blood-brain barrier is not present, are also glucose sensitive or not.",397d0fa4-68e4-4f50-964b-21f0f28f55d5
3,introduction3," These experiments demonstrated that subfornical organ (SFO) neurons are glucose-responsive and that subfornical organ (SFO) is an important sensor and integrative center of circulating signals of energy status .  But comprehensive transcriptional profiling of glucose-sensing neurons is challenging, as glucokinase (Gck) and other key proteins that transduce glucose signals are expressed at low levels. Glucose also exerts a hormonal-like action on neurons; electrophysiological recordings demonstrated, for example, that hypoglycemia activates growth hormone-releasing hormone (growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH)) neurons, suggesting a mechanistic link between low blood glucose levels and growth hormone release .  Nutrient-sensitive neurons reacting to glucose but also to fatty acids (FAs) concentrations are present at many sites throughout the brain and may play a key role in the neural control of energy and glucose homoeostasis.",791922eb-9e0c-460b-8811-7940cba8095d
4,introduction4," Central administration of oleate, for example, inhibits food intake and glucose production in rats. This suggests that daily variations in plasma FA concentrations could be detected by the central nervous system (CNS) as a signal that contributes to the regulation of energy balance .  Even though intracellular metabolism and activation of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels appear to be necessary for some signaling effects of FAs, a great amount of the FA responses in the ventromedial hypothalamic neurons are mediated by interactions with fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36. Translocase is a FA transporter/receptor that activates downstream signaling even in the absence of intracellular metabolism .",f9d6c05a-dfcb-4c07-8121-e2716a85baae
5,introduction5,"  The classical unified model is based on the role of the three metabolic substrates: lipids, glucose and protein/amino acids in maintaining the nutritional status throughout the corresponding loci in the central nervous system (CNS), but there are many other signals and brain targets .  Role of the neuroendocrine system in food intake control More recently, other hypothalamic appetite control regions have been identified, including those in the arcuate nucleus (arcuate nucleus (ARC)), the periventricular nucleus (periventricular nucleus (PVN)) and the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH)) . These are sites of convergence and integration of many central and peripheral signals, not just macronutrients, that are involved in food intake and energy expenditure mechanisms, e.g.",62ba04ac-aa98-43e3-b517-f3ed1e5ac72d
6,introduction6,", a group of neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) stimulating food intake via neuropeptide Y (neuropeptide Y (NPY)) and agouti gene-related protein (agouti gene related protein (AGRP)). These neurons interact with those producing the anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (pro opiomelanocortin (POMC)) and the cocaine/amphetamine-regulated transcript (cocaine/amphetamine regulated transcript (CART)) . Thus, a more comprehensive, unified model should include macronutrients as well as many single amino acids and other signaling molecules.  There are two distinguished types of food intake regulation: a) the short-term (satiety signals, SS) occurring at the beginning and end of a single meal; it also includes the length between meals and b) the long-term regulation (adiposity signal, AS) that is influenced by such factors as body fat deposition.",0bf7633f-63c0-4a2a-9387-18e02d9fb354
7,introduction7,"  The SS providing information to the brain mainly send information to the nucleus of the solitary tract (nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS)). These signals are generated in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and abdominal viscera, as well as in the oral cavity and provide information about mechanical and chemical properties of food. The information is transmitted via vagal and spinal nerve to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). The ASs arrive to the median eminence through arcuate nucleus (ARC) or through the blood-brain barrier (blood brain barrier (BBB)). All these afferents are integrated in a complex and not fully understood network.  Hormones like leptin and insulin, both secreted into the blood, reflect the stored body fat. These hormones can pass the blood brain barrier (BBB) and stimulate specific receptors.",05324663-c301-4377-ba50-b66b0621f38f
8,introduction8," Hypothalamic areas are richly supplied by axons from arcuate nucleus (ARC), which has greater concentrations of leptin and insulin receptors than any other hypothalamic site .  The arcuate nucleus (ARC) exerts opposing actions on food intake responding not only to leptin and insulin, but also to gut hormones (the most studied are ghrelin and, recently, peptide YY (PYY)). The neurophysiological pathways suggest that feeding is regulated by a feedback loop, where the hypothalamus provides the long-term regulatory input to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), which acts as a setpoint .  It has recently been proposed that the arcuate nucleus (ARC) is required for the coordination of homeostatic circadian systems including temperature and activity. Authors tested this hypothesis by injecting saporin toxin conjugated to leptin into the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of rats. Wiater et al.",635e40ab-d16c-426f-abb0-52c64923b4f5
9,introduction9," showed that the leptin-sensitive network is required for entrainment of activity by photic cues and entrainment of temperature by food but is not required for entrainment of activity by food or temperature by photic cues .  Another player: the gastrointestinal tract and gut microbiota The gastrointestinal tract (gastrointestinal tract (GIT)) plays a central role in the control of energy balance. Many molecules produced by the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) exert hunger or satiety effects on the brain. Ghrelin is a peptide produced mainly by the stomach's oxyntic cells that stimulates ghrelin secretion in the hypophysis and has some neuroendocrine activities. However, its orexigenic properties are the most relevant to us and ghrelin is the only known peripheral orexigenic hormone (Date, 2012). Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide produced mainly in the duodenum and jejunum that acts on the vagus nerve and directly on the hypothalamic nuclei.",b998ef41-07a0-4407-b458-bd79208a3476
10,introduction10," CCK is an anorexigenic factor and it reduces food intake, meal size and duration . Three other related hormones are pancreatic polypeptide (PP), amylin, and peptide YY (peptide YY (PYY)). PP is a peptide produced by the endocrine pancreas in relation to the caloric content of meals, and it reduces food intake both in rodents and humans. Amylin is a peptide co-secreted with insulin; its main effect on food control is a reduction of meal sizes and food intake . Peptide YY (peptide YY (PYY)) is produced in the gut and is similar to PP. peptide YY (PYY) is stored in intestinal cells and released into the circulation as peptide YY (PYY)3−36, a truncated form of peptide YY (PYY). The release of peptide YY (PYY)3−36 is dependent on a meal's caloric and fat content . The glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is produced by the cleavage of pro-glucagon gene in the intestine.",68960ccc-9807-4789-a724-47ca5c202ce6
11,introduction11," It acts as incretin at a pancreatic level, promoting insulin secretion and as neuro hormone on hypothalamic nuclei, inducing satiety .  The gut-brain link is important not only for the hormones produced by the gut, but also for the long-term body weight regulation. Studies in mice indicate that the gut microbiome influences both sides of the energy balance by contributing to nutrient absorption and regulating host genes that affect adiposity [however there are conflicting reports ]. However, it remains uncertain just how important gut microbiota are for nutrient absorption in humans. A cohort study has demonstrated that the nutrient load is a key variable that can influence the gut/fecal bacterial content over short time frames.",9c33f138-77dd-48b8-871f-79dad59635fe
12,introduction12," Furthermore, the observed associations between gut microbes and nutrient absorption indicates a possible role of the human gut microbiota in the regulation of the nutrient intake and utilization .  Moreover, according to recent evidence, meal onset appears to be biochemically induced only in the case of serious energy deprivation, while usually it is controlled by social, cultural and environmental factors strictly related to the lifestyle .  Systemic ketosis in KD therapy Ketogenic diets have become popular in recent decades for their demonstrated positive effects on weight loss , though the precise mechanism of action is not fully understood (Paoli, 2014). In fact there is contradictory data about KD in mice and rats. In fact, there are contradictory data about KD in mice and rats.",5bd7ced4-c405-4b8f-b983-7d9afa45d93a
13,introduction13," For example whilst a huge amount of data confirm that KD in humans is effective in weight reduction, improving lipidemia and glucose tolerance , it has been recently demonstrated that a long-term KD (22 weeks) caused dyslipidemia, a pro-inflammatory state, hepatic steatosis, glucose intolerance and a reduction in beta and alpha cell mass, all without weight loss in mice . Two considerations should be made: (1) the induction of ketosis and the response to ketosis in humans and mice are quite different and (2) mice and humans have different life spans, and results obtained in mice after several weeks on the diet can correspond to months on the diet in humans (Demetrius, 2005, 2006).  Regardless of its efficacy for weight loss, the medium-long diet duration  is over-cautiously received by the physicians, perhaps due to the lack of attention to the topic in specialized medical education courses.",7f7ea7e6-5539-478e-805f-6e458cb75ca6
14,introduction14," As a result, most physicians associate the term “ketosis” only in the context of diabetic ketoacidosis.  Meanwhile, the KD induces a ketosis that is not a pathological but physiological condition occurring on a daily basis. Hans Krebs was the first to use the term “physiological ketosis” despite the common view of it as oxymoron (Krebs, 1966); this physiological condition, i.e., ketosis, can be reached through fasting or through a drastically reduced carbohydrate diet (below 20 g per day). In these conditions, glucose reserves become insufficient both for normal fat oxidation via the supply of oxaloacetate in the Krebs cycle and for the supply of glucose to the central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS))  (Figure 1). It is well-known that the central nervous system (CNS) cannot use FAs as an energy source because free FAs cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (blood brain barrier (BBB)). This is why the brain normally uses only glucose.",35fb8e5a-5335-4607-84a5-47a65c961bb0
15,introduction15," After 3–4 days without carbohydrate intake (KD or fasting) the central nervous system (CNS) must find alternative energy sources as demonstrated by Cahill et al. (Owen et al., 1967, 1969; Felig et al., 1969; Cahill, 2006). These alternative energy sources are the ketones bodies (KBs): acetoacetate (AcAc), β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) and acetone and the process of their formation occurring principally in the mitochondrial matrix in the liver is called ketogenesis . Usually the concentration of KB is very low (<0.3 mmol/L) compared to glucose (≅ 4 mmol) (Veech, 2004; Paoli et al., 2010). Since glucose and KB have a similar KM for glucose transport to the brain the KB begin to be utilized as an energy source by the central nervous system (CNS) when they reach a concentration of about 4 mmol/L (Veech, 2004), which is close to the KM for the monocarboxylate transporter .",feaa3d9c-f32e-4f58-9e6b-3d17373ee20f
16,introduction16,"  Figure 1 Concentrations of KB: acetone, BHB and acetoacetic acid (AcAc), and plasma free FAs (free FAs (FFA)) from the post-absorptive state to 40 days of starvation in human subjects. Y axis was expanded to better describe the great change in BHB concentration. Modified from Fukao et al. (2004), Owen (2005).  KBs can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) but not in a homogenous manner. For example, past experiments have demonstrated that BHB utilization is different in various brain areas (Hawkins and Biebuyck, 1979). Areas without blood brain barrier (BBB), hypothalamic regions and the lower cortical layers have a higher BHB metabolism compared to the lower one of the basal ganglia (Hawkins and Biebuyck, 1979). Also the metabolic meaning of the three KBs is different: while the main KB produced in the liver is AcAc, the primary circulating ketone is BHB. The third one, acetone, is produced by spontaneous decarboxylation of AcAc, and it is the cause of the classic “fruity breath.",a0ebc876-f17e-4faa-a996-5562fbc7d9a8
17,introduction17,"” Acetone does not have any metabolic functions, but it can be used as a clinical diagnostic marker. BHB acid is not, strictly speaking, a KB because the ketone moiety has been reduced to a hydroxyl group. Under normal conditions the production of free AcAc is negligible and this compound, transported via the blood stream, is easily metabolized by various tissues including skeletal muscles and the heart. In conditions of overproduction, AcAc accumulates above normal levels and a part is converted to the other two KBs. The presence of KBs in the blood and their elimination via urine causes ketonemia and ketonuria. Apart from being the fundamental energy supply for central nervous system (CNS), glucose is necessary for the replenishment of the quota of oxaloacetate, since this intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)) is labile at body temperature and cannot be accumulated in the mitochondrial matrix.",547452d3-81d0-4dd2-b191-05628dd4c8fc
18,introduction18," Hence it is necessary to refurnish the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) with oxaloacetate via the anaplerotic cycle that derives it from glucose through ATP dependent carboxylation of pyruvic acid by pyruvate carboxylase . This pathway is the only way to create oxaloacetate in mammals. Once produced by the liver, KBs are used by tissues as a source of energy (Fukao et al., 2004; Veech, 2004; McCue, 2010): initially BHB is converted back to AcAc that is subsequently transformed into Acetoacetyl-CoA that undergoes a reaction producing two molecules of Acetyl-CoA to be used in the Krebs cycle (Figure 2).  Figure 2 A reduced availability of dietary carbohydrates leads to an increased liver production of KBs. The liver cannot utilize KBs because it lacks the mitochondrial enzyme succinyl-CoA: 3-ketoacid (oxoacid) CoA transferase (succinyl CoA 3 ketoacid (oxoacid) CoA transferase (SCOT)) necessary for activation of acetoacetate to acetoacetyl CoA.",6095997c-eb98-45b0-9a88-84b7bf1645b3
19,introduction19," KBs are utilized by tissues, in particularly by brain. KBs enter the citric acid cycle after being converted to acetyl CoA by hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBD)), succinyl-CoA: 3–CoA transferase (succinyl CoA 3 ketoacid (oxoacid) CoA transferase (SCOT)), and methylacetoacetyl CoA thiolase (methylacetoacetyl CoA thiolase (MAT)). Modified from Owen (2005), Paoli et al. (2014).  It is interesting to note that the KB are capable of producing more energy than glucose due to the changes in mitochondrial ATP production induced by KB (Kashiwaya et al., 1994; Sato et al., 1995; Veech, 2004). During fasting or KD glycaemia, though reduced, remains within physiological levels (Seyfried and Mukherjee, 2005; Paoli et al., 2011). This euglycemic response to extreme conditions comes from two main sources: glucogenic amino acids and glycerol liberated via lysis from triglycerides (Vazquez and Kazi, 1994; Veldhorst et al., 2009).",9c52b5ea-a485-4efd-bdd4-41d2e6ddfef3
20,introduction20," Glucogenic amino acids (neoglucogenesis from amino acids) are more important during the earlier phases of KD, while the glycerol becomes fundamental as the days go by. Thus, the glucose derived from glycerol (released from triglyceride hydrolysis) rises from 16% during a KD to 60% after a few days of complete fasting (Vazquez and Kazi, 1994). According to Bortz (1972) 38% of the new glucose formed from protein and glycerol is derived from glycerol in the lean while 79% in the obese . It is important to note that during physiological ketosis (fast or very low calorie ketogenic diets) ketonemia reaches maximum levels of 7–8 mmol/L with no change in blood pH, while in uncontrolled diabetic ketoacidosis blood concentration of KBs can exceed 20 mmol/L with a consequent lowering of blood pH (Robinson and Williamson, 1980; Cahill, 2006) (Table 1).  Table 1 Blood levels during a normal diet, ketogenic diet, and diabetic ketoacidosis .",1900687a-17c7-46e2-86c3-50a9d321b9de
21,introduction21,"  Blood levels	Normal diet	Ketogenic diet	Diabetic ketoacidosis	 Glucose (mg/dL)	80–120	65–80	>300	 Insulin (μU/L)	6–23	6.6–9.4	≅ 0	 KB conc (mmol/L)	0.1	7–8	>25	 pH	7.4	7.4	<7.3	 We can say that no species, including humans, could have survived for millions of years without the ability to withstand brief periods of hunger or starvation (Amen-Ra, 2006). These periods of fasting are themselves ketogenic (McCue, 2010) during which the concentrations of insulin and glucose decrease while that of glucagon increases in the attempt to maintain normal blood glucose levels. When the body passes from a condition of food abundance to one of deprivation (or else via VLCKD simulated deprivation), there is, with a slight delay, an increase in the concentration of free FAs as well as KB in the blood. Thus, from this point of view KD could be compared to caloric restriction for fasting.",6f64808f-dea0-4d04-af3a-b87d7359bafd
22,introduction22," These manipulations of nutrients, both in quantity and quality, seem to not only act on blood glucose/KB level but also to promote changes in metabolic pathways and cellular signaling. How this kind of metabolic condition (ketosis) can affect satiety and hunger mechanisms is still a matter of debate.  Effects of ketosis on hunger and satiety Although convincing, the bulk of evidence in relation to the inhibitory effects of ketosis on appetite is still anecdotal. Preliminary scientific reports seem to support this phenomenon, and the evidence shows that KD is more effective, at least in the short/medium-term, on fat loss (Paoli, 2014). It was demonstrated that diet-induced weight loss leads to changes in energy expenditure and in appetite-regulating hormones that facilitate weight regain and the return to initial energy homeostasis . This response to alteration of energy balance nullifies the success of many dietary approaches.",3dfe9a45-5c13-4a23-8c39-74b466e4da29
23,introduction23," It is well-known that the long-term success of a nutritional approach is defined by the amount of weight regain and is the main problem regarding the so-called weight cycling or “yo-yo” effect (Jeffery, 1996). A recent study by our group has demonstrated that a brief ketogenic period, if followed by a longer period of correct Mediterranean diet could avoid this yo-yo effect . During the ketogenic period subjects reported less hunger, confirming previous studies (Nickols-Richardson et al., 2005; Johnston et al., 2006; Johnstone et al., 2008) on hunger-suppression effect of ketogenic diet. Despite these clinical findings, the mechanisms of action of ketosis on appetite reduction are still not completely understood. Clinical results are suggestive of both direct and indirect (via modifications of hunger-related hormones concentration) actions of KBs on appetite .",ec2e2a51-a643-46aa-aae1-fcfb85305a58
24,introduction24,"  Role of ketosis in nutrient-specific control of hungers and satiety The findings of a stable  or slightly increased response  of post-prandial free FAs (FFA) after KD can be viewed in the nutrient-static context. Elevated circulating free FAs (FFA) may actually reduce food intake and glucose production through actions on specific hypothalamic neurons . It has been suggested that this effect could be mediated by the increase of cellular concentration of long-chain FAs-CoA in the arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus .  Brain glucose and KB uptake was investigated in rats subjected to mild experimental ketonemia induced by 2 weeks on the KD or by 48 h fasting. To test this, researchers developed a carbon-11 labeled AcAc (11)C-AcAc for PET use.",48c7b631-1b39-408d-bc30-920abe525c7d
25,introduction25," They found in rats that after 10 days of KD (11)C-AcAc brain uptake increased up to 8-fold, an increase comparable to those measured after 48 h of fasting .  The blood brain barrier (BBB), largely formed by the brain capillary endothelial cells, provides a protective barrier between the systemic blood and the extracellular environment of the central nervous system (CNS). Passage of FAs from the blood to the brain may occur either by diffusion or by proteins that facilitate their transport. Studies indicate that FATP-1 and FATP-4 are the predominant FA transport proteins expressed in the blood brain barrier (BBB) based on human and mouse expression studies .  As a matter of fact, in animal models intracerebroventricular injections of long-chain FA reduced hypothalamic expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY). neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an important orexogenic neuropeptide that is a downstream target of leptin and insulin in the hypothalamus.",0256c397-f754-4993-87b4-0f8ca2e136ba
26,introduction26," In some forms of hyperphagic obesity, characterized by elevated plasma leptin and insulin levels, the lack of action of insulin on neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression could explain the pathological condition. Central administration of oleic acid, fatty-acid synthase, or CPT-1 inhibitors prevents the rise in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA induced by fasting . But glucose level is also involved in KD's food control mechanisms. According to glucostatic theory (Mayer, 1955) data indicates that ketosis did not influence FA glucose but instead stimulated the elevation of post-prandial glucose (Sumithran and Proietto, 2013) in non-diabetic subjects, while in diabetics there was a reduction of fasting glucose . It is important to note that carbohydrate availability may increase cellular levels of long-chain FA-CoA through an increase of malonyl-CoA, which inhibits oxidation of FAs.",912c6108-1180-4ee0-9361-41683b51893a
27,introduction27,"  Another product of elevated levels of free FA is polyunsaturated FA (polyunsaturated FA (PUFA)). The potential ability of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) to block seizure activity in the brain is speculated to be associated with KD. Some mechanisms are thought to be a direct inhibition of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, modulation of a lipid-sensitive potassium channel, the activity of the sodium pump to limit neuronal excitability, or the induction of expression and activity of proteins in the mitochondria, thereby inducing a neuroprotective effect by partially inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) (Bough and Rho, 2007; Paoli et al., 2014).  Role of ketosis on neuroendocrine control of hungers and satiety The discovery of many appetite-related hormones provided molecular basis for appetite control, decreasing the relevance of the metabolites hypothesis . Recently, Sumithran et al.",0e7a30b4-a5c5-47d1-b4e1-acb595cb2af2
28,introduction28," demonstrated that there is a long-term persistence of changes in some peripheral hormones involved in food control . In this study, they found a significant difference in mean levels of many food intake-related hormones 1 year after the cessation of weight loss via the hypocaloric diet. There was a long lasting decrease of anorexigenic compounds: leptin, peptide YY (PYY), cholecystokinin, insulin, and pancreatic peptide and an increase of the orexigenic molecule ghrelin. Moreover, they found that hunger remained elevated 1 year after diet cessation. In a successive study the same group investigated hunger-related hormones after 8 weeks of KD, demonstrating that during ketosis the increase of ghrelin (a strong stimulator of appetite) was suppressed . These results are consistent with those of Ratliff et al , who found no significant change in fasting plasma ghrelin after 12 weeks of VLCD.",88212b0a-12e9-4dee-9167-df00bf43773f
29,introduction29,"  Moreover, in the above study of Sumithran et al. (2013), ketosis maintains post-prandial secretion of CCK as previously demonstrated by other researchers . Note that the orexigenic effect of BHB is blocked by transection of the common hepatic branch of the vagus nerve . The hepatic branch contains fibers from the proximal small intestine, stomach and pancreas, and is sensitive to CCK (Horn and Friedman, 2004); ghrelin signals to brain are also transmitted via vagus nerve . Thus, the effects of ketosis on these two appetite-related hormones could be one of the many factors related to the effects of such nutritional regimen on food control.  Many questions about the role of such an important intermediate of lipid metabolism remains unanswered, e.g., the role of BHB in food control.",d3bcdb3d-5908-4b78-84e9-2afd57efff41
30,introduction30," For example, whether or not BHB could act as a satiety signal in the brain, considering its role in energy supply to central nervous system (CNS). We have to consider that the effects of KBs on hunger reduction can only be seen after many days following fasting or KD initiation ; this is consistent with the abovementioned threshold of brain utilization of KB as an energy source, i.e., 4 mmol/L (Veech, 2004), which is close to the Km for the monocarboxylate transporter . During the first days of fasting or KD there is a rise of BHB and adiponectin concentrations . One of the putative causes of hunger in starved humans may be due—together with other causes—to adiponectin. When adiponectin binds to its receptor AdipoR1, AMP-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) is phosphorylated in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus .",eedce897-b079-403e-ba94-6844ce9e3ed1
31,introduction31," The increase of activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in the hypothalamus may increase food intake and hepatic glucose output in mice while the decrease seems to reduce food intake . KDs can also act similarly to a caloric restriction on activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Newman and Verdin, 2014). Interestingly, activated protein kinase (AMPK) seems to have opposing actions on the liver, muscle tissues and the brain: in liver and muscle activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation increases FA oxidation by decreasing malonyl-CoA concentrations (Malonyl-CoA is the first intermediate in the lipogenic pathway and is also an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1). CPT-1 activity can be limiting for FA oxidation), through the inactivation of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1). activated protein kinase (AMPK) can also increase the activity of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (malonyl CoA decarboxylase (MCD)), which enhances the decrease of malonyl-CoA levels.",c0485231-a663-4e44-9645-5f50e17cfd1c
32,introduction32,"  On the contrary, in the brain, as mentioned above, the increase of activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity leads to higher food intakes. But the effect of activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the brain is more complicated; mice lacking activated protein kinase (AMPK)a2 in pro-opiomelanocortin neurons develop obesity, while the deficiency of activated protein kinase (AMPK)a2 in agouti-related protein neurons results in an age-dependent phenotype. Thus, the conclusion is that even while activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a regulator of hypothalamic functions, it does not act as a signal for energy deficit or excess . However, the picture is more complex than this (Figure 3); BHB induces AgRP expression while increasing ATP and inhibiting activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation .",78423f4e-2924-4447-8ad1-e8aa20b47a60
33,introduction33," Moreover, Laeger and colleagues have recently demonstrated that under physiological conditions BHB decreases activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and AgRP mRNA expression in GT1-7 hypothalamic cells .  Figure 3 Effects of ketone bodies on AMP-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) actions in different tissues.  Another mechanism that could be involved in food-regulation during KD is the gamma aminobutyric acid (gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)) and glutamate regulation. Wu et al. demonstrated that gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic signaling from the neuropeptide Y (NPY)/AgRP neurons to the parabrachial nucleus (located in the dorsolateral part of the pons) is involved in many regulatory sensory stimuli including taste and gastric distension, regulate feeding behavior. gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling seems to prevent animals from anorexia when AgRP neurons were destroyed .",22171533-5350-4a3b-bf47-1fbd9309be22
34,introduction34," These findings are yet another contradictory aspect of KDs and food behavior; ketosis should increase the availability of glutamate (via diminution of transamination of glutamate to aspartate) and therefore increase gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamine levels; moreover, in ketosis, the brain imports a huge amount of acetate and converts it through glia into glutamine (an important precursor of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)) . The result of these mechanisms, together with the increased mitochondrial metabolism and flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle, is an increased synthesis of glutamine and a “buffering” of glutamate. These results are not consistent with the well-documented anorexigenic effect of KDs, and therefore the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) hypothesis cannot be taken into account despite the mild euphoria often reported during a KD that is probably due to the action of BHB (Brown, 2007) and can help to reduce appetite.",19bc28cf-3195-4eb5-b448-f0d2f77a9c8e
35,introduction35,"  Other possible mechanisms Gut microbiota It is known that different dietary components exert some effects on gut microbiome composition, mainly in relation to obesity and inflammatory states. In general, a Mediterranean diet has a positive effect while a high-protein diet seems to have detrimental effects due to putrefaction phenomena (Lopez-Legarrea et al., 2014; Flint et al., 2015). Few data are available at this time about the effects of KD on gut microbiota. For example, a study by Crawford et al. (2009) investigated the regulation of myocardial ketone body metabolism by the gut microbiota and demonstrated that, during fasting, the presence of gut microbiota improved the supply of ketone bodies to the heart where KBs were oxidized. In the absence of a microbiota, low levels of KB was associated with a related increase in glucose utilization, but heart weight was still significantly reduced.",f28b6b3c-2b1a-47d8-a531-e37ae579a665
36,introduction36," The myocardial-mass reduction was completely reversed in germ-free mice feeded with a ketogenic diet. Regarding food control we can hypothesize that the particular metabolic state of ketosis could provide some benefit to weight and food control via synergic actions between butyrate production by gut bacteria and circulating high blood ketones .  Reactive oxygen species As is in the case of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the intracellular reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) hypothesis works against the hunger-suppressive role of KD: it has been demonstrated that the hypothalamic reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase through NADPH oxidase is required for the eating-inhibitory effect of insulin (Jaillard et al.",dabe2737-4b57-440d-a756-7a07b01a3f4a
37,introduction37,", 2009); moreover it has been demonstrated that there is a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent signaling pathway within the hypothalamus that regulates the energy homeostasis, and that activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive mechanisms could be sufficient to promote satiety . On the other side, KBs decreases mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by increasing NADH oxidation in the mitochondrial respiratory chain .  Conclusions Although the hunger-reducing effect of KD is well-documented, its main mechanisms of action are still elusive. The global picture is complicated by the contradictory role of ketosis on anorexigenic and orexigenic signals (summarized in Figure 4). Ketones (mainly BHB) can act both orexigenically or anorexigenically.",caec2c79-90be-4bd4-8b58-d35b5aa681f5
38,introduction38," In the orexigenic mechanism, it increases the circulating level of adiponectin, increasing brain gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and decreasing brain reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The anorexigenic mechanism triggers a main normal glucose meal response, increasing circulating post-meal free FAs (FFA) (thus reducing cerebral neuropeptide Y (NPY)), maintaining CCK meal response and decreasing circulating ghrelin. It can be postulated that the net balance of the contrasting stimuli results in a general reduction of perceived hunger and food intake. More studies are needed to explore the mechanism of potential beneficial effects of KD on food control.  Figure 4 Scheme of orexigenic and anorexigenic effects of ketosis.
