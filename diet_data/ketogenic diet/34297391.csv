0,discussion0," This case study is unique in that a patient with progressive, deteriorating HD was managed with a time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD), with subsequent improvements in his motor symptoms (52% improvement from baseline), activities of daily living (28% improvement), cUHDRS score (20% improvement), most HD-related behavior problems (apathy, disorientation, anger, and irritability improved by 50–100%), and mood-related quality of life (25% improvement). Cognition did not improve. Weight remained stable and there were no significant adverse effects.  Used in isolation, fasting and ketogenic diets may each provide a bioenergetic advantage for neurons and muscle cells in a neurodegenerative disorder such as HD; however, there may be further advantages to combining them.",6e7aba84-e65e-4eb2-879f-81f15b770bd4
1,discussion1," On a practical level, time-restricted feeding eases the burden of organizing multiple meals and frees up time throughout the day, compensating for the extra time required to prepare the initially unfamiliar recipes of a ketogenic diet. In turn, the ketogenic diet improves blood insulin control and reduces long-term hunger , making the fasts more tolerable. The modified ketogenic diet used in this study additionally emphasized flexibility, palatability, and affordability whist also providing a rich variety of cuisine options, significantly alleviating the culinary and social restrictions that impede long-term success with older, conventional ketogenic diets .",56dea3a0-1c05-4d8f-baac-4a46cf95dd8e
2,discussion2," On a therapeutic level, since the essential aim of both fasting and ketogenic diets is to generate a series of metabolic alterations aimed at maximizing cell and mitochondria energy metabolism (Phillips, 2022), fasting probably augments the beneficial metabolic alterations induced by the ketogenic diet and vice versa.  One critical component of patient success on a metabolic strategy (particularly a ketogenic diet) is the use of blood glucose and ketone monitors to regularly check blood glucose and blood ketone beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels, the latter being the principal ketone contributing to brain and muscle energy metabolism. Monitors are easy to operate and allow difficulties in adherence to be rapidly recognized and corrected. During the 48-week time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD), our patient's mean blood glucose level remained relatively high at 9.71 mmol/L with only a marginal decrease in the HbA1C, indicating a modest impact on long-term glucose control.",5df31044-1054-4219-9888-7f88bc80c211
3,discussion3," However, he also documented fewer hypoglycemic episodes during the 48-week time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD), which likely resulted from a mitigation of the blood glucose spikes (and subsequent dips), leading to smoother control . With respect to our patient's blood ketones, the mean 48-week blood blood ketone beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) level during the time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD) was 0.90 mmol/L, which is within the range of therapeutic ketosis, albeit in the lower range. Since he adhered to the recipes in the time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD) booklet, the lower ketone levels likely related to the need for daily exogenous insulin, which would have constantly suppressed ketogenesis. Our patient's underweight body-mass index may have also limited the amount of endogenous body fat available for ketogenesis during the fasting periods.",76405419-36d8-4b9f-b2e1-198b38f7f2df
4,discussion4,"  In this case study, notable improvements were measured in the motor symptoms, activities of daily living, and cUHDRS score. Pathologically, the medium spiny neurons of the striatal indirect pathway exhibit the earliest and most severe degenerative changes in HD , leading to a relative overactivity of the direct pathway and hyperkinetic symptoms such as chorea and dystonia (Blumenstock and Dudanova, 2020). In theory, the time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD) enhanced energy metabolism in our patient's indirect medium spiny neurons, contributing to the observed 52% improvement in motor symptoms, which to our knowledge represents the first documented case of either fasting or a ketogenic diet leading to improved motor symptoms in a hyperkinetic movement disorder. By comparison, tetrabenazine, the only drug specifically licensed to treat chorea in HD, improves baseline chorea by 23.",164ffeb4-e721-4120-8f90-310717f6662b
5,discussion5,"5% (Huntington Study Group, 2006) but can produce many adverse effects which limit its clinical benefit (Coppen and Roos, 2017). We also measured improvements in activities of daily living, which may be significant given that daily function is more closely linked with health-related quality of life than motor symptoms or cognition in HD . The 20% improvement in the cUHDRS is noteworthy as this particular measurement best characterizes the clinical progression of HD and is strongly associated with brain measures of progressive corticostriatal atrophy . It is unclear why cognition did not improve at the week 48 assessment, but this finding may partly relate to a mild sedating effect of the lorazepam, which was not present at baseline or week 24.  The most marked improvements in this case study occurred with respect to behavior problems, with apathy, disorientation, anger, irritability each improving by 50–100%.",673db543-e370-4f96-b4ef-5101255f12e0
6,discussion6," From the perspective of the patient and his fiancée, the mitigation of the behavior problems represented the most beneficial aspect of the time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD) as they had undermined his social interactions and relationships, including their own. Our patient's pronounced apathy prior to commencing the time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD) was particularly concerning, as this was the factor most responsible for his preceding weight loss. Moreover, out of all the neuropsychiatric symptoms, apathy is the most consistent marker of HD progression . Given these considerations, the observed 75% improvement in apathy is encouraging. Only one behavior problem, anxiety, worsened during the time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD), which occurred in the setting of an unforeseen exacerbation of social stressors and was not attributed by either the patient or his fiancée to the time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD) itself.",27e5c307-0ed5-4ce4-acfe-ea91afc643fd
7,discussion7,"  The only adverse effects attributed to the time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD) were mild weight loss, decreased bowel movement frequency, and increased thirst. Although our patient's underweight body-mass index was a potential red flag prior to commencing the time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD), his 1.7 kg of weight loss turned out to be considerably lower compared with the 5–6 kg of weight he lost during the preceding 12 months. This raises the possibility of a weight-sparing effect induced by the time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD), which is consistent with the markedly delayed weight loss experienced by HD animal models on a ketogenic diet . The decreased bowel movement frequency and increased thirst were of no concern to our patient.  Since this is a case study, its major limitation is obvious and it is not possible to precisely determine the mechanism of the improvements.",4639ad6c-6c6c-4eb6-9bf0-5141cc0f557b
8,discussion8," Beyond the hypothesis that the time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD) enhanced brain and muscle energy metabolism and mitochondria function, other possibilities include improved diabetes control, a practice effect, a medication effect, and a placebo effect. First, our patient had type 1 diabetes and experienced improved blood glucose control, which may have benefitted his energy metabolism and HD symptoms (that said, the impact on the mean blood glucose level and HbA1C was modest). Second, a practice effect might have improved our patient's performance at each subsequent assessment (this seems unlikely, as the assessments were widely spaced at 24 weeks apart). Third, beyond impacting anxiety and cognition, the institution of lorazepam 8 months into the time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD) may have contributed to our patient's improved motor symptoms and behavior problems (but it would not explain the improvements from baseline to week 24).",c11c87ee-4c38-444b-83cd-aaa08682b03f
9,discussion9," Fourth, our patient could not be blinded to the intervention, so a placebo effect may have contributed to his improvements.  In conclusion, this case study is unique in that a patient with progressive, deteriorating HD was managed with a time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD), with subsequent improvements in his motor symptoms, activities of daily living, cUHDRS score, most HD-related behavior problems, and mood-related quality of life. Our patient remains dedicated to his time restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD), which both he and his fiancée continue to describe as “life-changing”. Despite the limitations of this case study, the outcome is encouraging and further studies involving metabolic strategies in HD are warranted.
