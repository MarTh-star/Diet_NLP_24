0,background0,"In 2013, the estimated incidence of primary brain cancers in the United States was 23,130, with 14,080 people dying from this malignancy [1]. Current treatment of primary brain cancers utilizes a multidisciplinary coordinated approach usually involving neurosurgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy [2,3]. The median survival period for the most aggressive primary brain malignancy, glioblastoma multiforme (glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)) remains dismal, ranging from 8 to 15 months [4,5]. Combining radiation therapy with temozolomide increases median survival by just 2.5 months [4]. This poor response to current treatments with its associated limited prognosis is the driving force for new and novel therapeutic approaches.  It has been proposed that energy-restricted ketogenic diets (energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD)) might serve as a metabolic treatment to improve survival of primary brain cancer patients [6-9].",0755002f-eb87-442a-a766-acbc53909f81
1,background1," The rationale underlying this therapy is based upon the differences between the ability of normal brain cells and tumors to utilize ketones as a metabolic fuel [10,11]. Under normal physiologic conditions, brain cells can obtain energy from either glucose or ketones. In contrast, many tumors become more dependent on glucose for energy support because they have decreased expression of critical ketolytic enzymes [12,13]. In theory, energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) is predicted to improve survival of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients simply by restricting tumors of glucose, while providing necessary metabolic fuel in the form of ketones to support vital organs including the brain. It is noteworthy that hyperglycemia is associated with adverse prognosis and post-operative function loss in patients with glioblastoma [14,15].",fccd84ae-02e1-4410-a90f-c539ab85edd9
2,background2,"  Detailed reports describing the treatment of advanced primary brain malignancies with energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) have been limited to just five patients [13,16-19]. One recent retrospective study reported the outcomes from six patients who implemented a ketogenic diet as adjunctive or complementary therapy with chemo radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy [6]. An additional 19 patients treated with a registered clinical trial using a ketogenic protocol were recently reported [20]. These limited reports suggest that the energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) may have antitumor activity in aggressive primary brain cancers. To address the question of whether energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) as a single modality can either halt disease progression or decrease the size of the tumor mass and improve the patients’ health, we have developed an energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) protocol (Figure 1).",73d0fdb7-1dd8-4e75-aa22-8e6a830db032

Initiation of ketonemia was accomplished by an initial supervised fast of approximately 48 h. The subjects were trained by an experienced registered dietitian (RD) to assure competency for adherence to the energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) protocol. The energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) protocol was to be administered for 12 weeks as medically appropriate. The diet protocol ideally was to consist of a commercial formula (Ketocal®; Nutricia North America, Gaithersburg, MD) to provide a 3:1 ratio of fat grams to the grams supplied by protein and carbohydrate. Protein adequacy was to be met by ensuring that subjects consumed approximately 0.6 grams protein per kilogram (kg) body weight.",13e1e23e-8d73-44f3-b175-9b931a2739fb

Estimated caloric intake of each subject is expected to be 20 to 25 Kcal per kg body weight per day with an estimated 20% restriction of calories per day. Training of the subjects to ensure adequate hydration was carried out during the inpatient phase of the study. The subjects were assigned to one of the RDs experienced with administration of energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) therapy working on the study team.

The first two patients after signing informed consent were treated with this protocol and are described below.  Patient no. 1, a 55-year-old white male, presented with complete left-sided visual blindness, decreased analytical mental skills, a slow methodical wide-based gait, and a right posterior brain mass with a histological diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

He was hospitalized to induce a decrease in glucose and an increase in ketones using Ketocal® (Nutricia North America, Gaithersburg, MD) to achieve 20 to 25 Kcal/kg body weight. Diet adherence and efficacy were monitored using AM and PM measurements of blood glucose and ketones. After an initial weight loss of 6% (188 to 176 lbs), the patient’s weight stabilized (Figure 3). Initial treatment with Ketocal® decreased his blood glucose, so that his AM and PM glucoses were <80 mg/dl and increased his AM and PM ketones to >3 mM, meeting the target concentrations stipulated in our study protocol (Figure 3).",59eae50a-5834-46ef-a7af-7584d76b24c5
13,methods9," Because of the low palatability of the Ketocal® formula, the patient was switched 6 days after beginning the energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) protocol to a ketogenic regular food diet pattern with a 3:1 ratio of fat to combined grams from proteins and carbohydrates. After hospital discharge on this diet, his PM ketones remained >3 mM and his AM >2 mM (Figure 3), but his AM and PM blood glucose increased to >80 mg/dl most of the time (61% of time) (Figure 3). After 4 weeks of treatment with the energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD), patient 1 withdrew from the study due to further impairment of vision, mobility and cognition, and magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI))-demonstrated tumor growth (Figure 4A,B).Figure 3  Blood glucose, ketones, and daily weights.

Fourteen months after initial diagnosis and treatment with surgery, radiation therapy, and temozolomide, the patient had documented tumor progression. After signing informed consent, he was treated with energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD). Initial hospitalization induced ketosis, and during the 12-week study, he remained ketotic. His blood glucose levels could not be maintained below the target value of 80 mg/dl but with a few exceptions remained below 100 mg/dl (Figure 3). Six weeks after starting the diet both his clinical exam and his PET scan demonstrated stable disease. After 12 weeks of energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD), he had both clinical and radiological evidence of tumor progression.",706b749d-0b8a-4416-b3f3-bca85ff50e34
16,methods12," He reported that his vision at times had decreased to the point that he appeared to be seeing through a tunnel. This symptom would wax and wane and usually improved with sleep. In addition, his word-finding skills had decreased. Neurological exam showed an increase in his deep tendon reflexes to 4+ bilaterally accompanied by ankle clonus. Both repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)s and PET scans demonstrated a new medial left frontal mass and an increase in midline deviation to the right from 5 to 13 mm. Blood studies showed that the serum cholesterol increased from 206 at initiation to 281 at 6 weeks and 252 after 12 weeks. His LDL cholesterol also increased from an initial value of 145 to 197 after 6 weeks and 182 at 12 weeks. The patient and his wife reported no significant adverse effects from treatment with the energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD), except for headaches that occurred between weeks 6 and 8 that were relieved by rest and over the counter headache medication.",351b06ef-0e06-4580-b30c-fc27b568f3ac
17,methods13,"  Both of these patients (no. 1 and no. 2) who were treated with an energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) protocol (Figure 1) had progression of their disease. Patient no. 1 progressed after 4 weeks of treatment with the energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD), and patient no. 2 had stable disease after 6 weeks but had progressed after 12 weeks of diet therapy. One explanation for the failure of the energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) to control these patients’ tumor progression may be the failure to keep the patient’s glucose in the target range of 50 to 70 mg/dl. Other possibilities include heterogenous expression of the mitochondrial ketolytic enzymes in their tumors. Immunohistochemical evaluation of mitochondrial ketolytic enzymes showed diminished expression of BDH-1 and OXCT-1 in patient no. 1’s original tumor. However, evaluation of his subsequent biopsy showed positive expression of BDH-1 (Figure 2C). The tumor of patient no.",95d57369-7ea5-4c70-ad0f-7b25ba15d49e
18,methods14," 2 was positive for both BDH-1 and OXCT-1 (Figure 2E,F). These data suggest that at least some of the malignant cells in these patients’ cancers could metabolize ketones and derive energy for subsequent growth.  Our experience suggests that it is critical to have at least weekly contact with a knowledgeable registered dietitian, so that the diet can be altered when necessary to maintain target blood levels of glucose and ketones and to have responsible family caregivers assist in all aspects of the diet and blood monitoring. Aside from the inconvenience of altering a patients’ customary diet, side effects attributable to the energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) were minimal.  Review of five previously published patient reports Five patients with advanced brain tumors and favorable responses to energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) have been reported (patients no. 3 to 7) (Table 1).",2c780fc9-feb5-454d-b335-d55d9033681a

27,methods23," Body mass index, reported in six patients, did not decrease more than 20%. Patient 5 was treated part of the time with 600 Kcal/day, and her BMI decreased from 25 to 20 (20%). Initially, patient no. 1 was treated with Ketocal® which maintained his glucose and ketones within the desired range. Because of the poor palatability of the Ketocal®, he elected to be changed to an energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) using ketogenic food pattern. This change in type of ketogenic diet modality resulted in his blood glucose increasing above the target range for our study while his serum ketones remained above 2 mm. Patients 3, 4, and 5 used medium chain triglycerides (MCT; as MCT oil) as a source of fat and patient no. 6 was initially started on a classical Atkins Diet and changed to an energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) with a ratio of 3.5:1 grams of fat to combined grams of protein and carbohydrates.

28,methods24," However, a target serum glucose ranging between 50 and 70 mg/dl was not always achieved and did not appear to be absolutely required in patients 3, 4, and 5 who achieved long-term disease free survival. Perhaps, the inability to decrease blood glucose into the target range was because of standard of care treatments and/or because the prescribed calorie decrease was limited. In the two new patients reported, the prescribed calorie restriction was limited to 20%.  The duration of response of the five previously published patients ranged from 4 months to more than five years (Table 4). Four patients were simultaneously treated with another treatment modality such as radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy in addition to treatment with the energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD).

Maintenance of blood glucose at <60 mg/dl was only accomplished in patient no. 5 who limited her daily calorie intake to 600 Kcal/day. Serum ketones reported in four patients varied from 1 to 4 mm. Serial PET scans obtained on two patients showed a 21% decrease in tumor glucose uptake during treatment with energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD). Because these patients were treated without a common treatment protocol and without periodic clinical, laboratory, and imaging evaluations, efficacy of the energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) as single modality therapy cannot be assessed.",322f4b71-6b9d-46ce-8ea8-10f0438e0325

They observed no serious adverse effects directly related to the diet and showed that the study was feasible which was their primary endpoint. Their study was not designed to test antitumor effects of the KD. Prescribed measurements of blood glucose and ketones were not performed. Patients tested their urine for ketones and 12 of the 13 evaluable patients had at least one urine positive for ketones.

Of the 19 patients, three discontinued the treatment because of poor tolerability. Of the 16 remaining patients, two had stable disease and one had a minor response. A trend towards an increase in progression-free survival was reported in patients with stable ketosis.  A retrospective review of 53 patients with high-grade glioma treated with concurrent chemo radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy was carried out to determine the association between ketogenic diet, adherence and survival, serum glucose and ketone levels, and dexamethasone dose [6]. Blood glucose levels were compared between patients on an unspecified/standard diet and a KD. Of the 53 patients, six underwent a KD during treatment.",63b1d1f8-0aba-4275-af36-93ae74d02018

One episode of grade II fatigue was reported. Four of six patients were alive at a median follow-up of 14 months. At the time of the report, two of the four living patients had recurrence and one was without evidence of disease 12 months after starting treatment. Investigators reported that the mean blood glucose of patients on a regular, non-controlled diet was 122 versus 84 mg/dl for those reporting adherence to a KD. Based on this retrospective study, a KD appears safe and well tolerated during the standard treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). It was noted that the retrospective design did not allow for determination of whether dietary restriction of carbohydrates or KD adherence was associated with the observed reduction in serum glucose levels.",e0c651c0-c608-4301-aaa0-91087ba8ff9c
33,methods29, It is significant that reductions in blood glucose were observed with KD adherence even in conjunction with high dose steroid treatment. ,0f2d2ec3-abd3-4f4f-8930-0702754dbdb5
34,discussion0,"This review of the two patients treated by the described protocol, the previous detailed case reports, and the case series reported by Rieger and by Champ suggests that energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) has minimal side effects and may be helpful in controlling some primary brain cancers. These studies serve to generate critical questions that, if addressed in rigorous clinical protocol studies, may have application to patient care.  Some of the critical questions are as follows:Is an energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) effective as a single modality treatment in patients with aggressive brain cancer?  If the energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) is effective in some patients, can outcomes be enhanced by limiting treatment to patients with decreased expression of the mitochondrial ketolytic enzymes BDH-1 and OXCT-1,",7b63edd9-3f04-4e91-82d2-3125f89ade13
35,discussion1," or other metabolic enzymes?  What is the optimal diet and calorie consumption per day that will maximize the antitumor effect?  What range of blood concentrations for increased serum ketones and decreased blood glucose are associated with maximal antitumor effect?    Conclusions Studies to answer these questions require a common protocol, with individual patient supervision by an experienced dietitian to adjust the patient’s diet after evaluating twice daily measurements of blood glucose and ketones and daily weights. Only with this kind of clinical study will the efficacy of the energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) in treatment of aggressive primary brain cancers be adequately evaluated.",c2b0b6c8-6968-4e9c-b1eb-5156d34e4d43
36,discussion2," The use of the energy restricted ketogenic diet (ERKD) as an adjunctive therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is promising; assessing the clinical utility of this therapy in larger prospective studies is dependent upon consensus regarding safety, validation of potential biomarkers of efficacy, and a standardized protocol for patient diet monitoring and evaluation.
