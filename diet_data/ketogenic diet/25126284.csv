1,methods1,"  Study design The present study comprised of a 6-month prospective, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over dietary trial comparing the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D to a standardised placebo diet for canine epilepsy. Dogs were fed either the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D or the placebo diet for 3 months (day 1 to day 90±2 d) followed directly by a subsequent respective switch of diet for a further 3 months (day 90 to day 180±2 d). Relevant data were collected on the following variables at visit 1 (day 2), visit 2 (day 90 (sd 2) d) and visit 3 (day 180 (sd 2) d): seizure frequency (generalised seizures); body weight; measurements of serum phenobarbital (PB) and/or potassium bromide (KBr) concentrations as appropriate; dynamic bile acids; complete blood cell count; standard clinical serum chemistry; adverse events; and visual analogue score (visual analogue score (VAS)) for ataxia, sedation and QoL.",f6613382-35ec-4789-bf3e-ef7bffd429b0

Owners of dogs meeting all the above-mentioned criteria received further information, both verbally and in writing, on all aspects of the study, including information about the protocol and explanations about the seizure frequency diary that was to be completed at home. Dogs were enroled as an individual experimental unit and independent of other dogs. A unique study case number, consisting of a two-digit number, ascending in a chronological order of enrolment, was allocated and used to identify each dog on all documents and samples throughout the study.",ac79ed0d-d213-45da-a857-e6c1dbda25c1
4,methods4," Twenty-one dogs were included in the analysis and all of them completed the study.  Visual analogue score visual analogue score (VAS) was recorded for ataxia, sedation and QoL using a line ranging from 0 to 100 mm. The observer was asked to draw a secondary intersecting line perpendicular to the line of measurement that best represented the subjective severity. A perpendicular line at 0 mm represented ‘asymptomatic/normal’ and at 100 mm represented either ‘ataxia so severe dog is unable to walk’ or ‘sedation to the extent dog only sleeps’ or ‘QoL is so poor euthanasia is requested’, respectively.  Experimental food The experimental placebo and test formulae were dry extruded kibble (Nestle Purina PetCare) formulated to meet or exceed the nutritional guidelines established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO)).",1d6e5157-4035-4298-a91e-a279245ea00e
5,methods5," Both formulae were of the same ingredient composition, and formulated to contain <10 % moisture, at least 28 % crude protein, at least 15 % crude fat and 50 % carbohydrates with <2 % as crude fibre. The only compositional exception was that zero Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) were added to the placebo formula, and lard was used as fat substitute to ensure that the formulae were isoenergetic (1560·6 kJ/100g (373 kcal/100 g)), whereas the test formula contained 5·5 % Medium chain triglyceride (MCT). Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) content was about 10 % of the total formula calories (based on fat as 35·6 kJ/g (8·5 kcal/g) and Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) as 28·5 kJ/g (6·8 kcal/g)). Proximate analysis of both formulae indicated that they were of similar composition, with the exception of Medium chain triglyceride (MCT), as the placebo diet was void of C12, C10 and C8 fatty acids (each <0·100 % of placebo formula).",2b3d6069-3bc6-46bd-9db0-bc1051aa6774

The dogs were housed and fed mainly once or twice daily at home with no restrictions on water consumption. The owners were educated to keep the diet consistent throughout the study period. The amount of food given per day was calculated according to the weight of each dog in order to provide sufficient food to fulfil their nutritional requirements. A deviation of ±10 % food consumption (kg) was allowed to account for the individual needs of each dog, taking into consideration differences in activity level and physical condition. Dogs were restricted to consumption of the study diet, and thus treats or snacks were replaced by the respective placebo or Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D food.",0134425a-6d66-4025-8617-ef3c9a485fed

Blood samples were collected 2 h after consumption of the respective diets and routine concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AED)s. Blood samples were collected and stored using clotting activator dipotassium EDTA-containing (with serum-separation gel) polypropylene blood-collection tubes and plain polypropylene blood-collection tubes (International Scientific Supplies Ltd). Blood samples were allowed to clot and serum was stored at −80°C.

9,methods9," Any concomitant treatments including routine antiepileptic drugs (AED) administered during the study period were recorded, detailing indication of treatments, products used and length of treatments (online Supplementary Table S2). To avoid confounding influences, concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AED) medication and dosages were unchanged throughout the study. Eighteen of the twenty-one dogs were drug-resistant. All twenty-one dogs received PB. Most dogs were treated additionally with KBr (n 18). Some dogs were chronically treated with a third antiepileptic drugs (AED), imepitoin (n 1) or levetiracetam (n 4).

Six dogs showed no response to the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D with an overall increase in seizure frequency. Seizure day frequency was also shown to be significantly lower when dogs were on the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D in comparison with the placebo diet (P=0·022), with over 80 % of the trial population achieving reduction in seizure day frequency (Fig. 1(b)) (online Supplementary Table S4).",b7ca253d-fefb-4186-84de-1b11d126f6a7

On the other hand, during the standardised placebo diet phase, the distribution was more varied with higher number of dogs with seizure occurrences per day. It is interesting to note that the results suggest a rapid onset of antiseizure efficacy. The total number of seizures (Fig. 3) and the number of dogs with seizure occurrences (Fig. 4) did not seem to gradually reduce throughout the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D phase, but instead showed improvements as early as day 1 and persisted throughout the diet period.

23,discussion0,"The primary focus of this study was to evaluate the antiepileptic efficacy and tolerability of a low Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-containing diet to dogs with idiopathic epilepsy chronically treated with standard antiepileptic drugs (AED)s. To achieve this objective, twenty-one dogs with epilepsy were enroled into a 6-month prospective study, in which they were separately fed the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D containing low concentrations of Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) (5·5 % as fed) for 3 months and an isoenergetic placebo diet containing the same levels of fat, protein and carbohydrate for 3 months. The results show that, for the first time, the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D – a diet with low Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) inclusion rate – had positive effects on reduction of both seizure frequency and seizure day frequency per month.",f78e5410-3d3d-4caa-90c6-a7282907c0df
24,discussion1," This KD was well tolerated and had no significant effect on weight or serum concentrations of glucose, PB or KBr in the dogs, and resulted in significantly higher serum concentrations of BHB, which was in accordance with the results reported by Patterson et al. (  36  ) and Pan et al. (  33  ). Collectively, the results support the use of the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D for difficult-to-manage canine epilepsy.  The KD diet is a therapeutic option commonly utilised in people with drug-resistant epilepsy, especially in children(  25  ). The anticonvulsant effectiveness of a KD, where most pharmacological treatments have failed, suggests a fundamental mechanistic difference between these treatment modalities.",a69d93ff-3c67-4d5f-99ef-f2c9fd73fff0
25,discussion2," Although the exact mechanisms resulting in the antiepileptic effects of the KD remain elusive, proposed mechanisms include involvement and/or alterations in brain energy metabolism, neurotransmitters, ketone bodies, antiepileptic drugs (AED), fatty acids and neuroactive peptides(  37  –  40  ). In human clinical practice, during a KD treatment, it has been shown that serum antiepileptic drugs (AED) concentrations may increase despite no changes in the dosage administered. In such cases, serum concentrations of PB have been shown to increase by up to 100 %(  41  ). It is, thus, reasonable to hypothesise an association between the antiepileptic effects of KD and the ability of the diet to influence serum concentrations of antiepileptic drugs (AED)s. This was investigated in an open clinical study of fifty-one children on a KD, which showed no significant changes in PB serum concentrations, along with other commonly administered antiepileptic drugs (AED)(  42  ).",37bda42d-82e1-493a-a03d-e30156997656
26,discussion3," The results presented in this study also show no significant changes in both the PB and the KBr plasma concentrations during the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D phase, suggesting alternative mechanisms of anticonvulsant properties.  The Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D utilised in this study has previously been shown to improve the brain function of aged dogs, and was hypothesised to exert these cognitive enhancements by providing the brain with an alternative energy source(  33  ). Ageing is commonly associated with declined efficiency of glucose metabolism in the brain, and has been demonstrated in both animals and humans. The Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D is able to increase ketone concentrations in the blood, and thus provides an alternative metabolic pathway(  33  ).",76147983-5134-4ec1-9758-370f1b5e24be
27,discussion4," Secondary to providing an alternative energy source, Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) may contribute to the maintenance of the neuronal structure via increasing concentrations of PUFA in the brain, which have also been shown to decrease as a consequence of ageing(  33  ). The Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D described in this study shows positive effects in both cognitive enhancement and seizure control, where pathological mechanisms or pathways involved may be similar or may act in a synergistic manner.  KD have often been associated with increases in BHB and other ketone bodies such as acetone and acetoacetate, which is in accordance with this study where administration of the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D resulted in significant increases in serum concentrations of BHB(  33  ,  43  ,  44  ). It has, thus, been hypothesised that the ketone bodies play a crucial role in the antiepileptic properties seen in KD.",6a504833-0dcc-4dd4-a6cd-7ece030afedd
28,discussion5," Studies involving administration of acetone and acetoacetate in animal models including rabbits, mice and rats have shown protection against induced seizures to varying degrees(  45  –  48  ). In our study, we showed Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D-related antiepileptic effects that were poorly correlated with relative changes in serum BHB concentrations. As serum concentrations of ketone bodies have not been consistently correlated with antiepileptic efficacy, others have suggested the importance of relative glucose reductions along with elevation of ketone bodies(  49  ). However, we showed reductions in seizure frequency with no significant changes in serum glucose concentrations between the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D and placebo diets. The Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D in this study resulted in seizure control, manifesting as seizure frequency and seizure day frequency reductions, which were not correlated with age or weight.",7006c5b6-a969-446e-b245-8ec8b60f6e82
29,discussion6," The mechanisms resulting in antiepileptic effects upon consumption of the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D seem to be irrespective of the age-related reduced efficiency of glucose metabolism or increases in relative serum BHB concentrations.  The results of this study suggest a rapid onset of antiepileptic properties associated with consumption of the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D. It is, therefore, likely that the mechanisms of action leading to the antiepileptic effects possessed by the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D also involve rapid biological processes. Studies have highlighted the potential involvement of individual constituents of the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)KD in the antiepileptic properties associated with the effectiveness of a KD. The main constituents of the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)KD consist of the 8-carbon caprylic acid along with other Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) including the 10-carbon capric acid and 12-carbon lauric acid(  50  –  52  ).",dbbc3a09-936a-4113-8834-3ad3ca81db4a
30,discussion7," Caprylic acid has been shown to significantly and dose-dependently increase the dosage of pentylenetetrazol required to induce myoclonic twitch and clonic convulsions(  50  ). Capric acid has also been shown to significantly and dose-dependently increase the seizure thresholds in the 6Hz and maximal electroshock seizure threshold tests(  51  ). It was, thus, suggested that other TAG may possess similar antiepileptic properties as those seen in caprylic and capric acids. Interestingly valporic acid (VPA, 2-propulpentanoic acid), the most common and widely used broad-spectrum epilepsy drug in humans worldwide, is also a TAG(  52  ). Unfortunately, VPA is commonly associated with unfavourable side-effects such as teratogenicity and hepatotoxicity. This highlights the need to search for novel agents such as fatty acid compounds with improved potency against seizures and a better side-effects profile compared with the drugs currently available.",7a25bef5-5970-447c-b186-ff05bc209627
31,discussion8," Recently, it has been shown that seizure activity correlates with phosphoinositide depletion and that VPA acts by restoring phosphoinositide levels(  53  ,  54  ). Other Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) such as 4-methyloctanoic acid (hircinoic acid) and nonanoic acid (pelargonic acid) were shown to exhibit similar effects with evidence of enhanced seizure control and an improved side-effects profile in comparison with VPA(  52  –  55  ). It has been shown that a Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)KD causes not only increases in ketone body production but also accumulation of Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) in the blood plasma; therefore, it is possible that specific Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) or downstream metabolites are acting directly to exert antiepileptic effects(  52  ).",9392ec54-2c81-43b2-92cb-2d06152915f4
32,discussion9," Furthermore, the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D implemented in this study contains much higher proportions of carbohydrates in comparison with traditional KD used in humans, which contain ratios of about 4:1 or 3:1 fats to proteins and carbohydrates. Despite this difference, the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D diet still shows antiepileptic effects, highlighting a disassociation between antiepileptic effectiveness and specific diet ratios, but instead potentially suggesting involvement of specific metabolite agents or constituents, such as fatty acid compounds with antiepileptic properties. However, canine and human metabolism of fats and carbohydrates differ, as dogs rely more significantly on fat metabolism compared with humans. More research is necessary to elucidate the mechanistic differences in fat metabolism and the relationship of energitic proportions contributed by Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) in KD.",b4453dbf-4cf5-46af-8723-48b69fd4a6cd
33,discussion10,"  The placebo effect is a well-known phenomenon and has been demonstrated, manifesting as a decrease in seizure frequency, in dogs with epilepsy. It was shown that the placebo effect accounted for 26–46 % of seizure reductions during placebo administration in comparison with baseline values(  56  ). The placebo response is thought to originate from bias in the owners’ observations and data collection, which is influenced by the positive attitudes of owners towards respective intervention treatment. This study comprised of a triple-blinded, randomised cross-over diet trial design, where the placebo effect was not relevant as dogs were fed both the test diet and the placebo diet. Another factor besides the placebo effect is the regression to the mean effect, highlighting the fact that most diseases wax and wane and that recruitment peaks at the time when the clinical signs are more severe(  56  ).",f65624ba-af76-4108-85a0-c07fd592f5d8
34,discussion11," We, therefore, have disregarded the analysis of the baseline data, which was only used as an inclusion criterion for the prospective trial.  In conclusion, the data shown are in accordance with evidence in the literature showing antiepileptic properties of the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)KD and KD, manifesting as reductions in seizure activities. By maintaining clinically effective levels of ketosis and anticonvulsant efficacy, this research indicates that more carbohydrates, although still a KD, can be utilised with the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)KD to increase palatability, nutrient balance, compliance and acceptability of the diet. This study provides evidence for the therapeutic management of canine epilepsy using the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D with further potential implications in dietary management for both human and canine drug-resistant epilepsy.",67202130-8bc3-4b27-ab35-8e77e48db36e
35,discussion12," Further investigations into the effectiveness and efficacy of the Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)D on epilepsy should involve a pragmatic approach with larger randomised controlled trials and inclusion of an intention-to-treat analysis.
