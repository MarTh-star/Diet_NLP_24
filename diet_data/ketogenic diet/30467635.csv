0,introduction0,"Glioblastoma (glioblastoma (GBM)) is the commonest malignant primary brain tumor in adults, affecting 2–3 per 100,000 per year [1]. Even with maximal safe resection, radiotherapy and temozolomide [2, 3], the prognosis remains poor [4]. In the last 10 years, a series of large-scale clinical trials testing targeted therapies have all reported negative results [4–6] with no change in the current standard of care. Patients and caregivers often explore other alternative treatment options, including dietary changes such as the ketogenic diet (KD). Indeed, the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership identified that ‘the effect of lifestyle factors, including diet, on tumor growth’ to be a top 10 research priority for the neuro-oncology community [5].  KD is an ‘umbrella term’ used to describe high fat, low carbohydrate, adequate protein diets which promote the utilization of fat for energy, in the form of ketones.",e5e4191e-9d76-4322-a99e-ffb0bfa3ceae
1,introduction1," Initially hypothesized to work by exploiting the ‘Warburg effect’ [6–9], newer theories have proposed other mechanisms of action, with ketone bodies and medium chain triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) fats playing a role in tumor metabolism, rather than or in addition to a reduction in glucose [10–13]. Animal models of glioma have shown that KD potentiates the effects of radiotherapy [14], reduce peri-tumoral edema [15] and reduce tumor angiogenesis [7]. In patients with gliomas, the evidence for KD is limited to case studies and single case reports [16–22]; all utilizing different KDs at different time points in the treatment pathway. No studies have been powered to assess efficacy.  Prior to designing and undertaking an adequately powered randomized control trial (randomized control trial (RCT)) investigating the efficacy of KDs in the therapeutic management of glioblastoma (GBM), feasibility must be demonstrated [23–25].",41a00f08-c5e8-426b-8c92-215acae0c0b6
2,introduction2," We conducted the Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) study to i) investigate protocol feasibility; ii) explore the potential impact of the study on patients’ quality of life and health; iii) explore patients’ perspectives of their decision-making when invited to participate in the study; and iv) optimize future phase III clinical trial design, whilst comparing two different KDs in an NHS setting.

3,methods0,"Study design Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) consisted of two parts; a pilot study and a qualitative study. To investigate the feasibility of KDs as an adjuvant therapy for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) undergoing chemoradiotherapy a prospective, non-blinded, single-center, randomized pilot study was undertaken. Twelve patients were randomized in a 1:1 ration to either medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)KD)) or modified ketogenic diet (modified ketogenic diet (MKD)). A three-month dietary intervention was planned (primary end point), following which patients could choose to continue with the diet for a total of 12 months (secondary end point).",3f77ed8f-88d6-46af-8db8-286832b5768f
4,methods1," To explore the decision-making of patients’ invited to participate in Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) a qualitative study was embedded, interviewing patients who participated and declined, along with their caregivers. Ethical approval was granted by North West-Greater Manchester West Research Ethics Committee (17/NW/0013). Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) was registered with the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry (reference number 71665562) and ClinicalTrials.gov (reference number NCT03075514). The Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) pilot study protocol has been published previously [26] (substantial amendments are detailed in the online resources).  Participants Patients were recruited from a single adult neuroscience center.",c05a8df4-5678-4cf2-9995-435714e8786b

Patients were not eligible if they had any prior use of a KD, kidney, liver or gallbladder dysfunction, Metabolic or eating disorder, Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) ≤ 18.5 kg/m2, were taking weight loss medications, pregnant or breastfeeding, or had Medical conditions that may increase risks associated with KD.  Randomization Patients were randomized to either medium chain triglyceride (MCT) KD or modified ketogenic diet (MKD) using 'sealedenvelope'™ randomization system and a permuted block randomization method, ensuring similar numbers in each group, at a ratio of 1:1.",dc5ffb7b-c48c-450d-8087-6bae36653f55
6,methods3," This was constructed and administered by the study statistician (constructed and administered by the study statistician (CTS)), who was not involved with recruiting patients, thus concealing the sequence of allocation. Patients were then informed of their dietary intervention group by telephone and initiated diet within five working days of consent.  Dietary intervention and procedures Two KDs were included in Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING); medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)KD) and modified ketogenic diet (MKD). A comparison of the macronutrient content, example meal plan and monitoring requirements for each diet can be found in Online Resource 1, Table A. Patients and their caregiver (if present) received dietary education from the dietician and were provided with a bespoke seven-day meal plan, recipes, dietary information sheets and food diaries.",590ef6f0-92a1-4348-8b76-bf5b64ee8456
7,methods4," medium chain triglyceride (MCT) was provided as Betaquik® (Vitaflo International Ltd), a nutritional product available by prescription. Patients were reviewed by telephone at weeks one, three and nine, and in an outpatient’s clinic at weeks six and twelve. Patients who wished to continue with the diet were then reviewed at six, nine and 12 months. Urinary ketones were monitored twice daily for the first six weeks, then weekly thereafter using Ketostix® (Bayer, Germany). Blood ketones and glucose levels were monitored once weekly using GlucoMen Aero 2 K® home monitoring kit (Abbott Laboratories, UK). All surgical and oncological interventions were undertaken as per current standard of care [28].  Outcomes The primary outcome for Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) was to estimate retention rate at three months to inform sample size calculations for future definitive trials.",540e558a-c709-4a9b-b6f5-34f960660d0c

All outcomes were assessed at three months and twelve months.",bc09893d-bbad-463c-bab0-3a2c74efe8f3
9,methods6,"  Pilot success for Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) was graded using a predetermined traffic light system (≥ 75% to proceed, ≥ 50% required review and < 50% study closure), which considered recruitment success, retention rates, dietary acceptability, the commencement of diet pre chemoradiotherapy and extent of missing data [29]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)) was used to interpret tumor progression. Progression free survival (Progression free survival (PFS)) was defined as the time from date of surgery randomization to date of recurrence on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Recurrence was defined by a Neuroradiologist using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (Response Assessment in Neuro Oncology (RANO)) criteria [30]. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from date of surgery to date of death from any cause.",544badd7-8bc7-434b-872a-edbbd18c8948

11,analysis0,"Previous feasibility work estimated recruitment targets of one patient per month [32], in keeping with National Institute for Health Research (National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)) funded trials [33]. Twelve patients were to be recruited over 12 months. Descriptive statistical methods were used and Progression free survival (PFS) and OS were Progression free survival (PFS) and OS were assessed Kaplan–Meier survival curves. During the course of the pilot study it was clear that retention on diet was an issue and with agreement from the Trial Steering Committee, a sub analyses was introduced at week six, with a view to providing further information which would inform the design of later trials. This was not included in the original study protocol (for amendments see Online Resource 2).",c1a7fab2-4790-4a85-a915-a242dd841101
12,analysis1,"  Qualitative study Due to poor recruitment in the early stages of the Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) study, we proceeded to amend the protocol to embed a qualitative component to explore patients’ decision-making about Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING). Participants for the qualitative study were a purposively sampled sub-set of patients and their caregivers, who had been approached to participate in Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) [34, 35]. Sampling was informed by the review of screening logs maintained as part of Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) and aimed to include both those who consented and declined, those randomized to medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)KD) and those to modified ketogenic diet (MKD).",c08787cf-0818-460a-bac7-77a8a11cb370
13,analysis2," Patients were interviewed retrospectively, up to three months after being approached about Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING). Adequate sample size was determined using the ‘information power’ concept [36, 37]. The interviews were conversational, patient-centered, topic guided (see Online Resource 3, Table A) and iterative. The topic guide was devised by two members of the research team (KM, GC). The researcher conducting the interviews had a dual role (dietician and qualitative researcher), therefore, interviews were reflexive and conducted in a gentle, sensitive and non-judging manner, to make the experience as comfortable as possible for patients. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Analysis drew on the Braun and Clarke thematic approach to identify patterns of meaning within the data [38]. KM lead a process of iterating between the developing analysis and new data (familiarization).",5e03abc6-0e9e-4e7b-a4fb-d722713f578a

Role of caregivers	No data	The caregivers of those patients who participated in Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) also described their decision as instantaneous, “I’d take anything with open arms because anything that would help cure [the tumor], you know… I’d jump at it” (T47/R), with caregivers attributing a kind of selfishness to their motives: “I wanted her to have a go… I suppose it’s a bit selfish really but you know you, there’s a selfish element in it because you want her to be here sort of thing” (T39/R)	Silence in Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING),",427a85a6-cbd1-4c01-8988-1d953e1115d3

Those who participated in Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) required support both practically and emotionally, with caregivers emphasizing the diet to be “a new normal for us” (T45/R). Whilst those who withdrew sought their relative opinion and support in their decision to withdraw: “it’s too long on the diet” (T47/R)	 4.",b3db55d2-df4b-4d8c-ba86-303d3ea18a2a

41,discussion0,"This randomized, pilot study with an embedded qualitative design was designed to explore the feasibility of KD trials for patients with glioblastoma, with a view to recommending improvements to optimize the design of future phase III trials.  Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) recruited to time and target, despite an initial slow start. The recruitment rate (28.6% of the eligible population) was much lower than National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) HTA funded oncology clinical trials (50 to 89%) [33], but in keeping with recent survey data from the National Brain Tumour Society, with 21% of patients with brain tumors participating in clinical trials [40, 41]. Screening log data at the start of Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) revealed that patients were declining to participate due to (i) not wanting to participate in research; (ii) the burden of dietitian visits; and (iii) the burden of KD.",952aec3f-3945-4da5-a944-d28f7fce8c9a
42,discussion1," During the qualitative study those patients who declined to participate in Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) identified their quality of life as an important factor in decision-making, and this aspect was not detected in the screening log data or in previous surveys regarding participation barriers [40]. These patients also spoke of the role of caregivers in influencing their decision to participate or not in Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING), an aspect highlighted in trials elsewhere [41]. In contrast, patients who consented to Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) made an intuitive and emotional decision, later reflecting that this decision was based upon quantity rather than quality of life. This optimism surrounding longevity of life is often used as a coping strategy by patients and may not invalidate their informed consent.",a9eec1d9-d30d-4058-a1bd-8e6f4bf939bc
43,discussion2," There is currently little guidance offered by the Health Research Authority (Health Research Authority (HRA)) Good Clinical Practice guidelines [42] regarding this matter, thus clinicians should continue to use their clinical judgement when assessing patients’ informed consent to participate in trials. Our findings are in keeping with recent publications highlighting the need for improved recruitment strategies and decisional support in neuro-oncology populations [40, 41].  The retention rate in Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) was lower than anticipated. Out of the 12 patients randomized, 10 commenced KD and only four met the primary endpoint of three-month dietary intervention (1 KD, 3 modified ketogenic diet (MKD)).",3884e8b4-7020-4f72-8371-a6aa4e39dd40
44,discussion3," Cancer trials in general report median retention rates of 89% (IQR 79–97% with valid primary outcome data at follow up) [33] and previous KD studies for patients with glioblastoma (GBM) report retention rates of 50 to 100%, with retention determined at eight weeks [19], three months [18, 32] and the point of tumor progression [17]. However, patients in these previous KD studies self-selected to try the diet, mainly at recurrence or post-treatment, creating an optimistic bias in retention, when compared to the general unselected glioblastoma (GBM) population approached for Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING).",f4fe8dfa-0a40-4ef2-aa44-bc1795461c81
45,discussion4," Those who withdrew from Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) did so either after randomization but prior to commencing the diet (n = 2) or after following the KD for approximately six weeks (medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)KD) median 38 days [36 to 40 days], n = 2); modified ketogenic diet (MKD) 39.5 days [32 to 49 days], n = 4), during which time patients were undergoing radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy. Patients reported their reasons for withdrawal to be related to dietary burden and side effects, in particular nausea, which could have been related to the chemotherapy. Those continued on their assigned KD were generally younger patients with more favorable prognostic features (MGMT methylated; IDH-1 mutant) and this may also have influenced their ability to stay on the study and implement the diet.  The reasons for poor retention on diet were explored in our qualitative study.",4f1a3aec-78f4-473d-8697-2b4a6a5d8f93
46,discussion5," Those who withdrew spoke of finding their low urinary and blood ketones to be ‘demoralizing’, feeling that the diet was not working, and withdrawing due to the negative effect this feeling had on their quality of life. This was confirmed in the quality of life data as patients who withdrew reported their global health status (Global Health Status (GHS)) to be below the brain cancer reference value at week six of the study. We appreciate multiple factors can affect the quality of life for these patients and whilst ketones are used to monitor the diet, urinary ketones not always robust markers of compliance and can be effected by hydration levels and the use of dexamethasone. Therefore low ketones may demoralize patients, even when they appear to be following the diet robustly.",6636d063-e7ad-4fcc-b967-3317d805bdd7
47,discussion6,"  For those patients who continued to participate in the trial to 12 months, Global Health Status (GHS) reduced within the medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)KD) group and improved in the modified ketogenic diet (MKD) group. However, during the qualitative interviews, both groups reported to experiencing a ‘fantastic quality of life’ describing the diet as offering a sense of ‘control’ whilst receiving their tumor treatment. Although the EORTC QLQC30 and BN20 questionnaires are validated for patients with glioblastoma, they are time consuming to complete and some questions are not relevant for patients following KDs. It may be beneficial for future KD trials to reduce the length of the questionnaire and therefore patient burden, focusing particularly on Global Health Status (GHS), as these questions provided the most insight in Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING).",bb33dce2-99eb-4197-8940-2fe9cbdd48e2
48,discussion7,"  During interviews, patients reported several motivational factors for continuing with the diet, including through online blogs of long term glioblastoma survivors, positive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) results and high ketone levels, using these as a means of validating their decision to stay on diet. This corroborates the findings from Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) since high ketones indicted compliance with KD. Patients with higher ketones stayed in the study, whilst those with lower ketones withdrew early, at around week six. Furthermore, a pilot study for KD in patients with other advanced cancers (breast, ovarian, lung, gastrointestinal), also experienced similar retention rates to Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) (retention rate 31%, n = 5 of 16), in a trial which permitted a more liberal KD (70 g of carbohydrates per day) and where all food provision was provided [43].",2e802d9d-ce13-4376-ac45-f71137cb5bf9
49,discussion8," Thus, a more flexible dietary approach may not be the simple solution.  The high withdrawal rates in Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) suggest that a three-month KD intervention may be too long for most patients. Our qualitative study also highlighted that those who withdrew considered the three-month intervention to be undesirable, an opinion also reflected by those who declined, further corroborating findings from Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING). A shorter, six-week intervention, is likely to be more tolerable and acceptable to patients. This could be offered alongside radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy, which coincides with the proposed optimal time for the diet derived from animal model data [14]. Offering the diet at the same hospital site as the radiotherapy would aid a timely start of the diet.",5f441705-23b7-4694-ab98-4a74ea6c236e
50,discussion9," Whilst patients reported ‘feeling free again’ once the diet was discontinued, it is important to note, that this may not necessarily equate to dietary acceptability outside of a clinical trial. In a future post-trial environment, information regarding the efficacy of the diet may be available, which could alter patients’ willingness to engage.  The qualitative study also highlighted caregivers to be key in supporting patients to implement the diet. The role of caregivers, both in the decision-making of patients and the ongoing support offered, were aspects that were underappreciated in Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING). A recent KD study for patients with Alzheimer’s disease, also highlighted dietary and caregiver burden to be influential over patient withdrawal [44].  Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING) had several limitations.",db3b74bc-638d-4432-bd30-546c7b6a5e3b
51,discussion10," The return rate of food and ketone diaries was low at 12 months, subsequently affecting the analysis. This is a common problem in dietary intervention trials, given the time commitment required to return diaries. All accounts of dietary intake were also self-reported and at risk of reporter bias. The sample size for the qualitative was small and we cannot be certain that saturation was achieved. Nevertheless, drawing on the concept of ‘information power’ in qualitative research [36], this study had a well specified aim, and it has provided insights that will be valuable in informing a future phase III trial. Some patients were also interviewed up to three months after their decision about Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING).",61ba3c2f-af07-4638-8437-415fd89bbd2e
52,discussion11," They may have found it difficult to accurately recall their decision-making process, particularly given the nature of their condition and the numerous other decisions they will likely have had to make regarding their care and treatment.  In order to optimize protocol feasibility and patient experience future trials should consider the following suggestions:To assess effectiveness in a phase III trial a six–week diet intervention period would be deliverable.  To optimize recruitment and retention a longitudinal, prospective, qualitative study, which focuses on patient and caregivers understanding and decision-making in the context of trial participation should be embedded within KD trials.",824388be-abea-494d-9cde-6f496b5d9576
53,discussion12,"  Future phase III trials would benefit from an internal pilot to further test the recommendations derived from Ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (KEATING), focusing on stop/ go criteria for staged recruitment, retention at 6-weeks and commencement of diet prior to chemoradiotherapy.    In conclusion, recruitment of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) to a KD trial is possible. To assess efficacy in a phase III clinical trial, a six-week intervention period is proposed. The role of caregivers in the patients’ decision-making process and in supporting patients to implement KDs should not be underestimated.
