Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines and Eip75B mutant fly lines were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center (Indiana University).  Diets  Solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) contains 30 g Difco granulated agar (Becton-Dickinson, Sparks, MD), 44 g YSC-1 yeast (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 328 g cornmeal (Lab Scientific, Highlands, NJ), 400 ml unsulfured Grandma’s molasses (Lab Scientific), 3.6 L water, 40 ml propionic acid (Sigma), and tegosept (8 g Methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate in 75 ml of 95% ethanol) (Sigma). YD contains YSC-1 yeast (Sigma) in water.

MI24 and lifespan assays  Flies were injured using a High Impact Trauma (HIT) device as described by Katzenberger et al. [26, 27]. Vials containing 60 flies at 0–7 days old were injured by 4 strikes at 5 min intervals with the spring deflected to 90°. Vials with mixed sex flies had approximately 30 males and 30 females. The Mortality Index at 24 h (MI24) was calculated by subtracting the percent of uninjured flies that died from the percent of injured flies that died during the 24 h following Traumatic brain injury (TBI). The lifespan of adult flies that survived 24 h following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) flies was determined using vials with 20 flies each. The number of surviving flies was counted daily until all flies had died. Flies were transferred to new vials approximately every 3 days. Flies were considered dead if they did not show obvious locomotor activity.",b5fa04f7-a9de-48a4-98e6-809a4afae7b8

4,results0," Ketogenic diet following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) reduces the incidence of early mortality  We previously found that the diet consumed directly after Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Drosophila substantially affects the incidence of early mortality [28, 29]. Flies fed cornmeal-molasses-yeast diet (a standard laboratory fly diet) or simple carbohydrates (i.e., sucrose, glucose, and fructose) during the 24 h following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) have a significantly higher MI24 than flies fed water. To further explore the effect of diet on the MI24, we examined different concentrations of cornmeal-molasses-yeast diet (cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD)), yeast diet (YD, S. cerevisiae), and ketogenic diet (KD, a commercial mouse ketogenic diet). Based on caloric content, cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) is high in carbohydrate and low in protein and fat, YD is high in carbohydrate and protein and low in fat, and KD is high in fat and low in carbohydrate and protein (Table 1).",f46f233a-c789-45eb-b5aa-55fc802dd19d
5,results1," Diets were dissolved in water at 0.5 g/ml, serially diluted by 2-fold increments in water down to 0.0625 g/ml, and 200 μl was absorbed onto a filter paper disc that was placed at the bottom of a vial. 0–7 day old, mixed sex w1118 flies cultured on solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) (i.e., undiluted cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD)), were subjected to four strikes from the High Impact Trauma (HIT) device with 5 min between strikes and transferred to vials with diets at different concentrations.  We found that the MI24 increased to a similar extent with increasing concentrations of cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) and YD (Fig 1A). In contrast, the MI24 was not affected by increasing concentrations of KD. We also examined the effect of cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD), YD, and KD as well as glucose and sucrose at approximately the same caloric content (0.3 cal/200 μl) (Table 1).",5ef2a8bb-bbea-4a04-82db-2ef705529241
6,results2," MI24 values were similar for flies fed cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD), YD, glucose, or sucrose and they were significantly higher than the MI24 of flies fed water (Fig 1B). In contrast, the MI24 of flies fed KD was the same as that of flies fed water. These data support our prior finding that ingestion of carbohydrate after Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases the MI24 and demonstrate that ingestion of fat after Traumatic brain injury (TBI) does not increase the MI24 compared with water.  10.1371/journal.pone.0258873.g001 Fig 1 Analysis of the effect of cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD), YD, and KD on the MI24.

An alternative interpretation of the data in Fig 1A and 1B is that flies did not consume KD, suggesting that starvation and water have equivalent effects on the MI24.",12ff297b-df54-45ab-b04f-72afbc607122
9,results5," To test this possibility, we determined the MI24 of 0–7 day old, mixed sex w1118 flies that were starved by placing them in vials with a dry filter paper disc following Traumatic brain injury (TBI). In contrast with flies fed KD, the MI24 of starved flies was substantially higher than that of flies fed water (Fig 1C), demonstrating that consuming KD rather than starvation was beneficial. As an additional approach to test if flies consumed KD, we examined the lifespan of uninjured, mixed sex w1118 flies cultured on solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) to 0–7 days old and thereafter on water or 0.3 cal/200 μl cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) or KD. The median and maximum lifespans of flies cultured on KD (14.7 ± 1.1 days and 37 days, respectively) were longer than those of flies cultured on water (10.6 ± 0.1 days and 13 days, respectively) and shorter than those of flies cultured on cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) (23.4 ± 0.",59e59d76-8805-4103-a321-29700cfac002
10,results6,"6 days and 74 days, respectively), indicating that flies examined in Fig 1A and 1B consumed KD (Fig 1D). Further support for this conclusion is provided in Fig 4B.  Ketogenic diet is similarly beneficial following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in females versus males and in different genetic backgrounds  To investigate whether KD has sex-specific effects on Traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes, we compared effects of KD, water, and solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) on the MI24 of 0–7 day old female, male, and mixed sex w1118 flies. In each case, solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) resulted in a significantly higher MI24 than both water and KD, and water and KD had equivalent MI24 values (Fig 2A). Moreover, comparisons of male, female, and mixed sex flies, revealed that KD as well as solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) and water had similar effects on the MI24.",735bc0e3-4fb8-4cc1-bd7d-5c4a925d219d
11,results7," Therefore, sex does not alter the effects of KD, water, and solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) on secondary injury mechanisms that cause early mortality following Traumatic brain injury (TBI).  10.1371/journal.pone.0258873.g002 Fig 2 The beneficial effect of KD on early mortality after Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is equivalent in females and males and is conserved in different genetic backgrounds.  (A) MI24 values were determined for 0–7 day old female, male, and mix sex w1118 flies fed solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD), water, or 0.3 cal/200 μl KD.

We previously found that the MI24 of flies fed solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) varied significantly among fly lines with different genetic backgrounds, including inbred fly lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP)) [26, 28, 29, 34]. To determine the extent to which genetic background affects the MI24 of flies fed KD following Traumatic brain injury (TBI), we examined three lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) that have different MI24 values when fed solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) [28, 29]. We fed 0–7 day old, mixed sex flies 0.",ded0360c-983b-4001-9ca0-d1d9ba04952e
13,results9,"3 cal/200 μl KD or cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) for 24 h following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and determined the MI24 of each line. For all three Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines, the MI24 of flies fed KD was lower than the MI24 of flies fed cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) (Fig 2B). Moreover, the w1118 line and the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines fed KD had comparable MI24 values, whereas these values varied among the same fly lines when fed cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) (Figs 1B and 2B). These results indicate that the beneficial effect of KD on the MI24 does not depend on the starting value of the MI24 (on cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD)) in different fly lines, leading to uniformly low MI24 values for flies fed KD.",7876d9cd-fbca-4a07-a0fb-8746dfd38c10
14,results10," However, it does appear that the beneficial effect of KD has a limiting threshold beyond which it cannot act further, resulting in a proportionally greater rescuing effect for lines with higher MI24 values on cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD).  Ketogenic diet following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has beneficial long-term effects on lifespan  For both humans and flies, individuals that survive Traumatic brain injury (TBI) manifest a variety of long-term consequences, including reduced lifespan, as a result of secondary injuries triggered by primary injuries to the brain. The exact connection between primary injuries and secondary injuries is complex, and the details are still poorly understood. The fact that the MI24 is reduced in flies fed KD immediately after Traumatic brain injury (TBI), raises the question of whether the beneficial effects of KD extend to longer-term pathological consequences of Traumatic brain injury (TBI).",9e4edd27-29b6-4ec8-ad3b-5b0aeecd66d8
15,results11," We examined this possibility using lifespan as a readout. Lifespan was determined for 0–7 day old, mixed sex w1118 flies fed 0.3 cal/200 μl KD or cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) for 24 h following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) with surviving flies subsequently cultured on solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD). As we reported previously, flies fed cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) for 24 h after injury had a reduced lifespan relative to uninjured controls (Kaplan-Meier Fisher’s Exact Test, p = 4.1X10-9 at 50%) (Fig 3) [26, 29]. The same was true for flies fed KD (Kaplan-Meier Fisher’s Exact Test, p = 1.7X10-7 at 50%). However, notably, injured flies fed KD rather than cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) for 24 h after injury had a significantly longer median lifespan (40.3 ± 0.2 days vs. 37.8 ± 0.28 days, Kaplan-Meier Fisher’s Exact Test, p = 1.0X10-4 at 50%).",268a1c58-f345-4bc4-a1bc-d125d558a149
16,results12," Moreover, the difference in median lifespan between injured flies and uninjured controls was much narrower for KD-fed than for cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD)-fed flies (40.3 ± 0.2 days vs. 44.2 ± 0.8 days for KD; 37.8 ± 0.28 days vs. 48.2 ± 1.0 days for cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD)). Thus, flies that avoid early mortality following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) because of the beneficial effects of KD during a 24 h window after primary injuries continue to manifest long-term benefits of this diet weeks later.  10.1371/journal.pone.0258873.g003 Fig 3 KD has a long-term beneficial effect on lifespan following Traumatic brain injury (TBI).  Percent survival was determined for uninjured and injured 0–7 day old, mixed sex w1118 flies fed 0.3 cal/200 μl cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) or KD for 24 h following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) thereafter, that is, flies in the experiment that survived 24 h feeding on 0.",7ca97002-f52a-4e3c-9f3d-56559ff95ace
17,results13,"3 cal/200 μl cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) or KD were fed solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) throughout the rest of their lifespan. At least 230 flies were examined for each condition. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean (SEM), and the horizontal line at 50% indicates the median lifespan.  Beneficial effects of KD on early mortality are mediated by the PPARγ ortholog Eip75B  In mammals, the mechanism of action of KD is mediated by the transcription factor PPARγ, which has neuroprotective effects in a number of progressive neurological disorders, including Traumatic brain injury (TBI) [19, 20]. Because KD exerts a protective effect following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in flies as well as mammals, we hypothesized that the underlying mechanism is conserved as well. If so, the protective effect in flies should depend on the transcription factor Eip75B (ecdysone-induced protein 75B), the Drosophila ortholog of PPARγ.",6f65b1cc-563a-4061-a5f3-15696efdbbd3
18,results14," The orthologous relationship is inferred both from amino acid sequence identity (i.e., Eip75B is the most significant match to human PPARγ in a BLAST search of the Drosophila proteome) and from common activation by the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone [37–39]. Under this hypothesis, mutational loss of Eip75B should result in loss of the beneficial effect of KD. Thus, we examined the effect of water and 0.3 cal/200 μl KD on the MI24 of 0–7 day old, mixed sex Eip75B mutant flies. Three hypomorphic alleles of Eip75B (Eip75BMI04895, Eip75BKG04491, and Eip75BBG02576) containing transposon insertions within the transcribed region were examined (Fig 4A). As in Fig 1, the MI24 was comparably low in control w1118 flies fed either water or KD (ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison test, p = 0.835) (Fig 4B).",1b4a3c62-46ae-4d80-9696-0cce6b271120
19,results15," In contrast, although water-fed Eip75BKG04491, Eip75BBG02576, and Eip75B MI04895/Eip75BBG02576 flies still had low MI24 values comparable to that of water-fed w1118 controls, MI24 values were higher in KD-fed Eip75B mutants (ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison test, p = 0.078, p = 0.033, and p = 0.006, respectively), indicating that the beneficial effect of KD was impaired in these mutants. Furthermore, higher MI24 values in KD-fed versus water-fed mutants provides further evidence that flies consumed KD. The beneficial effect of KD was, however, retained in Eip75BMI04895 homozygotes (ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison test, p = 0.999), which we attribute to a presumptive weaker loss of function of Eip75B caused by this mutation. Eip75BMI04895 only disrupts three of the seven Eip75B pre-mRNA isoforms, whereas Eip75BKG04491 and Eip75BBG02576 disrupt four and five isoforms, respectively (Fig 4A).",9ad9f833-0606-441d-a1ce-3517fef7025f
20,results16," Thus, while it remains possible that differences in genetic background underlie differences in MI24 values for Eip75B mutant flies fed water versus KD, the data support the conclusion that activation of Eip75B/PPARγ by KD triggers mechanisms that reduce early mortality following Traumatic brain injury (TBI).  10.1371/journal.pone.0258873.g004 Fig 4 The beneficial effect of KD on early mortality following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) requires Eip75B.

One minor point is to make clear along the y-axes that MI24 is a percentage. It is unlabelled and not clarified in the legends.  Also in the text on page on page 4, ""varies from 7 to 58"" should be ""7% to 58% among 179....""  We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. To increase clarity, we added the following sentence to the legends for Figures 1, 2, and 4. “The MI24 represents the percent mortality of injured flies minus the percent mortality of uninjured flies 24 h following Traumatic brain injury (TBI).",171710ef-95df-4b75-8684-aa99ed1dc333
33,discussion11,"”  Adding percent or % to the y-axis label is problematic because the MI24 is defined as a percent. So, MI24 percent and MI24% are redundant and percent mortality and % mortality are incorrect. Furthermore, I would like the graphs to be consistent with our prior publications. We have published graphs in nine papers with y-axes labeled MI24, and other labs have also used this nomenclature.  Reviewer #2: It is surprising that the authors were unwilling to accommodate minor changes to the text that would have helped emphasize the importance of this work to a broader audience. While my recommendation is to accept the paper based on its technical soundness and its improvement from the review process, I would encourage the authors to be more flexible in the future.

38,discussion16," Here, we discovered that an interaction between the genetic factor Eip75B/PPARγ and the environmental factor KD affects early mortality in a fly Traumatic brain injury (TBI) model. In particular, whereas flies fed high-carbohydrate cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) or YD exhibited a dose-dependent increase in early mortality compared with flies fed water, flies fed high-fat KD showed no increase in early mortality (Fig 1A and 1B). The beneficial effect of KD on early mortality was equivalent in males and females, conserved in different genetic backgrounds, and had long-term beneficial effects on lifespan as well (Figs 2 and 3). However, the beneficial effect of KD on early mortality was diminished in flies mutant for Eip75B, a transcription factor orthologous to mammalian PPARγ, suggesting that KD exerts its effect through Eip75B (Fig 4B).",78d56a7c-3954-4eaf-8d0b-e3a2515b2d49
39,discussion17," These data provide a mechanistic link between KD and PPARγ in modifying Traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes and demonstrate the utility of the fly Traumatic brain injury (TBI) model for dissecting interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect Traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes.  The KD-Eip75B/PPARγ pathway may reduce early mortality following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) by inhibiting Relish/NF-κB  Our data suggest that KD reduces early mortality following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) by activating Eip75B/PPARγ. However, it remains to be determined what occurs downstream of Eip75B/PPARγ to exert this effect. One possibility is that Eip75B/PPARγ controls expression of genes involved in inflammation.",3a0fb42b-cde5-4fd0-9e53-a9a045a593f9
40,discussion18," In mammals, activation of PPARγ by dietary fatty acids mitigates neuroinflammation by inhibiting NF-κB, a transcriptional activator of cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion genes downstream of Toll-like receptor (TLR)/Interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) and Tumor necrosis factor-α receptor (Tumor necrosis factor α receptor (TNFR)) innate immune response signaling pathways [19]. PPARγ inhibits NF-κB by a variety of mechanisms, including ubiquitination and degradation, export from the nucleus, competition for cofactors, and steric inhibition of DNA binding [40]. In mammalian Traumatic brain injury (TBI) models, reduced NF-κB activity resulting from treatment with the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone or other pharmacological agents improves outcomes [22–25, 41–46]. Reducing NF-κB activity also improves Traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes in flies [33].",1ea17576-d45e-448d-96e5-a5e45cbe8fbc
41,discussion19," Heterozygosity for a null mutation of Relish, one of three NF-κB genes in Drosophila, reduces early mortality and increases lifespan following Traumatic brain injury (TBI). Relish functions in the Immune-deficiency (Imd) pathway that is homologous to the Tumor necrosis factor α receptor (TNFR) pathway in mammals and controls transcription of numerous antimicrobial peptide genes (AMPs) that produce resistance to infection [47, 48]. A confirmed transcriptional target of Relish in Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the AMP gene Metchnikowin (Mtk), which when mutated reduces early mortality and increases lifespan following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) [32]. Thus, KD-mediated activation of Eip75B/PPARγ may reduce early mortality following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) by inhibiting Relish/NF-κB.",8d4031ac-60e1-4cae-8880-24805b2f9224
42,discussion20," This could be tested in the fly Traumatic brain injury (TBI) model by examining effects of KD and pioglitazone on the MI24, lifespan, and expression of AMP genes in wild type as well as Relish and Mtk mutant flies.  KD and water appear to reduce early mortality following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) by different mechanisms  Genetically diverse fly lines fed KD or water following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) consistently had a lower incidence of early mortality relative to flies fed high-carbohydrate diets (Figs 1A and 1B and 2) [29]. These data suggest that KD and water might activate the same protective pathways. Water is a fasting condition where the amount of available carbohydrate is decreased, forcing a switch to the use of fatty acids as a nutrient supply through beta-oxidation and ketogenesis [49]. Ketogenesis converts acetyl-CoA to ketone bodies (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate, acetone, and acetoacetate) that are used by the brain and other tissues to produce energy.",08bd9da0-686b-4284-a229-efdb2206d1ca
43,discussion21," Flies with impaired mitochondrial ATP synthase activity produce elevated amounts of β-hydroxybutyrate, indicating that ketogenesis operates in flies [50]. Additionally, aggressive behaviors and early mortality induced by Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in flies are reduced when flies are raised on high-carbohydrate diet supplemented with β-hydroxybutyrate relative to high-carbohydrate diet alone, indicating that β-hydroxybutyrate operates in the fly Traumatic brain injury (TBI) model [35]. Nonetheless, several lines of evidence argue that KD and water act by distinct mechanisms to reduce early mortality following Traumatic brain injury (TBI). First, the MI24 of Eip75B mutants differed depending on whether they were fed KD or water, indicating that water acts independently of Eip75B/PPARγ (Fig 4B).",67eb0221-41cb-48ab-8340-21d410000e07
44,discussion22," Second, we previously found that flies fed water versus cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) exhibited increased expression of AMP genes following Traumatic brain injury (TBI), suggesting that the beneficial effects of water are not mediated by inhibition of Relish, which activates the transcription of AMP genes [29]. Third, while heterozygosity for a mutation of Relish reduced the incidence of early mortality for flies fed cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) following Traumatic brain injury (TBI), it did not affect the incidence of early mortality for flies fed water following Traumatic brain injury (TBI), suggesting that water functions either downstream or independently of Relish [33].  In conclusion, our observations indicate that KD signals through PPARγ to improve Traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes in flies.",f4513ef1-d49a-4f6e-9889-a4cb2d00bb15
45,discussion23," Thus, the fly Traumatic brain injury (TBI) model offers considerable potential for understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects of KD and may ultimately facilitate development of therapeutic intervention for Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)  Reviewer #1: In this manuscript the authors test the impact of feeding flies a ketogenic (KD) vs high carbohydrate diet (cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD)) in the 24 hrs after Traumatic brain injury (TBI).",bde33cdc-0fd7-4fd8-b9db-c23d2ed2a122
54,discussion32," The system they use is the so-called High Impact Trauma (HIT) device to administer Traumatic brain injury (TBI). They find that animals on a the cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) diet or a yeast diet have standard high mortality after 24 hrs, whereas animals on a KD have low mortality similar to feeding animals water. They provide evidence that the animals are eating because starved animals have a high mortality. They show that the protective effect of a KD is conferred upon a range of genetic backgrounds, and then provide molecular insight by showing that the effect is dependent on Eip75B gene function, which is the homolog of PPAR-gamma. These findings suggest that KD, by activating Eip75B activity, mitigates the deleterious outcomes of Traumatic brain injury (TBI). These data are consistent with some mammalian findings.  Overall this is an interesting and appropriate manuscript. There are just a few points that need to be addressed..",d1b12e1b-b782-43e4-a109-4e22d5ce5c8a
55,discussion33,"  In Figure 2, are the lifespans of the different strains on KD significantly different? The RAL441 and RAL391 look like they might be. Thus, whereas on a cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) diet, the mortality is marked different, on a KD diet it may still be different but overall dramatically better.  In figure 3, at first it is rather confusing why these lifespans are so dramatically different from those in figure 1. They could clarify this by making the point more clearly that the flies are cultured differently. That is…  ”Lifespan was determined…for 24 h following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) but then surviving flies were cultured on solid cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD).”  Also, some of their arguments about lifespan (median lifespan between injured and uninjured animals; Fig 3) seem sketchy because the uninjured cornmeal molasses yeast diet (CMYD) animals have a better median lifespan than KD animals.",d91bcf99-4ad8-4b77-985d-bb7c9d9428e7
56,discussion34," So the animals survive better after Traumatic brain injury (TBI) if on a KD for 24 hrs, but after that, the KD lifespan is compromised. So it seems like there are pros and cons. How do they explain or interpret this.  Since only 1 of two Eip75B alleles showed loss of the KD benefit, the significance of Eip75B function seems questionable also. Maybe those results are due to genetic background. Can they show somehow that the alleles are of a strength consistent with their interpretation that the MI04895 allele is less severe? This needs another allele, and/or controls for background, or some other way of validating the findings to be properly interpreted. Perhaps they could measure activation of PPAR-gamma to at least show correlation. In any case, this point needs to be strengthened.  Reviewer #2: This is an interesting paper by Blommer et al that provides novel experimental data indicating that a ketogenic diet can mediate beneficial effects in a fly model of traumatic brain injury.",bafcae2b-1008-417f-a544-42f67ba9fdac
57,discussion35," My comments are as followed:  1. Please make sure that gene names are consistently italicized.  2. According to the Alliance of Genome Resources, Eip75B is an ortholog of the following human genes: NR1D2, PPARA, PPARG, NR1D1, and PPARD. It may be worthwhile to mention that PPARG is not the sole ortholog of this fly gene.  3. In the Introduction, I would mention that traumatic brain injury is a known risk factor dementia. This will help highlight the broader importance of your research. There are multiple papers one could cite for this, such as this recent systematic review and meta-analysis (PMID: 33044182).  4. In the Introduction, it may be useful to mention that there is a growing interest in the interplay between lipid metabolism and aging. Dr. Anne Brunet has published excellent reviews on this topic.  5. It would be helpful if the authors can explicitly list the increase in median and mean lifespan in response to a ketogenic diet.",2c870de8-07ca-4b33-b526-10a6a56109f2
58,discussion36," For those looking to do systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses in the future, this information could be useful. It may be simplest to do this in the form of a table that summarizes all of the lifespan results (i.e., p-value, median increase, mean increase).  6. While there is evidence that a ketogenic diet may be beneficial in specific circumstances, it may not be as impactful as other dietary interventions (e.g., caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet). In the Discussion, can the authors comment on where a ketogenic diet will be specifically beneficial vs. other dietary alterations and why they think this is the case?  7. Major sections vs. sub-sections need to be demarcated more clearly. I recommend making major sections entirely capitalized (e.g., ",62cb9183-41da-4050-bdfe-4174881942ac
