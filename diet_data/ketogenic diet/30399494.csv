KDs are the treatment of choice for neurometabolic disorders such as glucose transport type 1 deficiency syndrome1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency2 and are effective in reducing seizure frequency in approximately one third of patients with epilepsy.",823ff1ab-46de-441b-8dcd-5c4d16b21727
15,results13,"3   Ketogenic diets are inappropriate for some individuals, for example, with primary carnitine deficiencies and β‐oxidation defects, and thus, screening biochemical tests to rule out such disorders are a crucial part of pre‐diet assessment. KDs cause the body's metabolism to adjust, utilizing ketone bodies rather than glucose as its primary energy source. Due to stringent dietary restriction, individuals following a KD are often at risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies,4, 5 and therefore, close biochemical monitoring is required to ensure nutritional adequacy and safety.  International consensus guidelines regarding optimal care of pediatric patients on KD therapies have been recently updated, including which biochemical tests (blood and urine) should be completed prior to diet initiation and during the treatment period.6 These follow on from KD care guidelines for resource‐limited countries published in 2015, including required and desired biochemical monitoring.",f2e841a8-8968-4cdb-b37e-e327d86d9e64
16,results14,"7   Over the past two decades, the number of KD services in the UK and Ireland has increased from 22 to 39, with a concomitant surge in the number of patients on diet (from 101 in 20008 to 754 in 2017).9 Centers in the UK and Ireland have local guidance for biochemical assessment and monitoring for KD patients but, to date, there has been no comparison nor consolidation of existing practices. Many of the biochemical tests required during KD treatment must be sent to specialist centers, further inflating costs and delays to treatment, conflicting with the current climate of the National Health Service (National Health Service (NHS)), where services aim to be clinically and cost‐effective. The 2018 international recommendations involved a high proportion of non‐UK healthcare professionals from countries where costs are paid by insurance or by the patient privately, which could lead to disparities in practice.",fdbdd0bb-6eb1-49b5-97e7-d58ca9fec8b6
17,results15,"  We aimed to (a) explore current practice of biochemical testing in KD patients across the UK and Ireland in comparison with international guidelines, (b) determine approximate costs of biochemical testing in KD patients across the UK and Ireland, and (c) promote greater consistency in KD services nationally. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of its kind. It is hoped that this work will help determine adherence to guidelines with regards biochemical monitoring of patients with epilepsy following a KD in the UK and Ireland, and whether action needs to be taken to streamline practice while ensuring patient safety and financial benefit.  2 ",3bbf32ff-5da6-403a-a608-ae42c92a79cb
18,discussion0," Our study illustrates that biochemical assessment and monitoring of KD patients with epilepsy vary widely across the UK and Ireland and do not fully correspond to international best practice guidelines.6 This variability is reflected in the associated costs of biochemistry testing. To our knowledge, there are no other previously published works outlining which biochemical tests are requested in KD patients in the UK and Ireland and their financial impact.  Variability of practice is inevitable, due to differing patient populations in each center and the acute needs of individuals, particularly in the complex cohort that commence dietary therapy for refractory epilepsy. However, the level of variability among our participating centers seems striking. This may be partially explained by the fact that the expansion of KD services in the UK and Ireland is a recent and somewhat sporadic phenomenon.",2044686f-6144-4662-9b55-8d7d07d41cc1
19,discussion1,"9, 10 Only in recent years have technological advances and the creation of national groups, such as Ketogenic Dietitians Research Network (KDRN), facilitated liaison across participatory centers, promoting communication, and sharing of resources. Research study protocols, such as those from the original randomized controlled trial at Great Ormond Street11 and Ketogenic Diet in Infants with Epilepsy (Ketogenic Diet in Infants with Epilepsy (KIWE)),12 may also influence what tests are requested at participating centers.  Our costing results, although approximate, indicate that biochemical testing for KD patients can have a substantial financial impact on services, as well as highlighting the variability between centers. The final cost to an individual center will vary, as large teaching hospitals can often benefit from lower costings due to higher workload and are more likely to have specialist tests available on site. Between hospital laboratories, the items included in a profile vary.",2aad6c09-0d2a-4483-b6bd-494d602da922
20,discussion2," In addition, the type of technology used (eg high‐throughput minimal intervention automated analyzers versus mass spectrometry for 25‐hydroxy vitamin D3) and, in some cases, the interpretation of the laboratory price list can also impact the final cost: Some centers may ask for the cost to measure a set of electrolytes, liver function tests, and a bone profile, whereas asking for a “full profile” should cost slightly less due to the overlap in tests. Notwithstanding these caveats, a difference of £334.39 between minimum and maximum requested baseline tests and £430.89 for 3‐month review tests in our participating centers is noteworthy.  Any “lesser” costs in KD laboratory monitoring need to be balanced against the possible increased risk of complications, with associated costs.",876b4a9f-5b56-474f-a627-15ccff75278e
21,discussion3," Even the cost of “complete” KD monitoring may be less than treatment with a new antiepileptic drug, which can cost up to approximately £100/month,13 as well as the costs implicated in seizure‐related complications. On the other hand, it may not be appropriate to test for each recommended parameter at every review, such as vitamin D, due to the time taken for changes to take effect.14, 15   Magnesium and zinc were requested by all our participating centers at baseline, despite not being included in international best practice guidelines for pre‐diet evaluation. This may represent a cost saving if unnecessary in most patients. No report of zinc deficiencies in individuals following a KD has been identified, although classical KDs with a 2:1 ratio or higher fail to meet the dietary reference intake for zinc, despite “selection of nutrient dense foods”.",7adcd9a1-ea93-46a6-b44f-e8d7bf9ed0d3
22,discussion4,"16 One may argue that if mentioned as “optional” to measure at review, as in international guidelines, baseline assessment of zinc would also be appropriate. Mean plasma magnesium levels have been found to decrease in children on the classical KD,4 and the diet has been shown to provide suboptimal magnesium levels.16 Intakes of zinc and magnesium may be suboptimal even prior to KD initiation: 3%‐27% and 0%‐50% of the UK population surveyed in the latest National Diet and Nutrition Survey (including males and females across all age groups above 1.5 years) do not meet the lower reference nutrient intake (reference nutrient intake (RNI)) for zinc and magnesium, respectively.",14df6aa3-1c45-4c9d-8d8a-904c7f85bf88
23,discussion5,"17   The discrepancies between which tests were requested at all review appointments in our centers compared to international recommendations may be predominantly cost‐driven, particularly considering that the 2018 guidelines involved a high proportion of non‐UK healthcare professionals from countries where costs are paid by insurance or by the patient privately, compared to the government‐funded UK National Health Service, which could potentially be considered “resource‐limited.” Furthermore, while NICE recommends KDs for pediatric refractory epilepsy,18 it does not suggest recommendations for monitoring and so there is no UK cost‐effective reference guidelines. In previous guidelines issued for resource‐limited regions, bicarbonate was deemed mandatory at baseline and review, and urinalysis and lipid profile were mandatory at review.",2899e5cb-b836-4c9c-ab46-7ca07b0db3eb
24,discussion6,"7   Published reports of abnormalities in individuals following KDs may provide guidance as to whether it is necessary to request the “missing” parameters at each review in UK and Ireland centers. Besides dyslipidemia, which is one of the most well‐cited (although often transient) biochemical side effects of KDs, occurring in approximately 12% of children studied prospectively on a KD,19 reports of abnormalities of other parameters are uncommon. Individuals following a KD have been shown to have reduced serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D concentration (as were individuals solely on antiepileptic drugs) and reduced bone mass (to a greater extent than in individuals solely on drug therapy)20; another study found 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels (which were mostly low at diet initiation) to improve initially on commencement of a KD, including supplementation, but to decline after three months.",ff70015a-6cfa-434c-a8de-75f721071448
25,discussion7,"21 Selenium deficiency has been reported in 66 individuals on KD treatment,22, 23, 24, 25 associated with cardiomyopathy in two of these patients23, 25 and sudden cardiac death in another two.24 A trend of decreasing plasma selenium was noted in participants of the original randomized controlled trial at GOSH, with a significant decrease between baseline and six months in children on the classical KD, although mean plasma selenium was maintained within the GOSH reference ranges.4   In view of the possible association of selenium with cardiac abnormalities, monitoring of selenium seems significant, although prolonged QT interval has also been reported in three cases following a KD in the absence of selenium deficiency.26 The frequency of testing at review, particularly in the 12‐ to 24‐month follow‐up period, may need revisiting specifically for the UK and Ireland in order to balance clinical safety with the potential financial/logistical constraints of 6‐monthly testing.",e3d2c01b-d9e0-4476-9f2d-c26502ee43ae
26,discussion8,"  This study has several limitations. Only 16 of the 39 centers that (to our knowledge) practice KDs within the UK and Ireland volunteered to answer the survey; practice in the other centers remains unknown. The survey was not validated and could be subject to reporter error. Our cost estimations would also improve in accuracy with greater center participation. A follow‐up study to assess whether rate of complications is correlated with frequency and “completeness” of laboratory monitoring would be pertinent.  Biochemical monitoring of KD patients varies widely across the UK and Ireland and does not fully correspond to international best practice guidelines.
