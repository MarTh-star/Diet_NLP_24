0,conclusion0,"Initially thought to be unique to cancer cells, the Warburg effect, characterized by upregulated glycolysis with preferential fermentation of glucose to lactate even in the presence of oxygen, is observed in a wide range of inflammatory immune cells. Myeloid and lymphoid cells of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, ranging from lymphocytes and NK cells to DCs and macrophages, undergo Warburg‐like metabolic reprogramming in response to inflammatory stimuli. Blocking this upregulation of aerobic glycolysis dampens inflammatory responses, impairing the differentiation and function of pro‐inflammatory cell types while favoring anti‐inflammatory and regulatory immune phenotypes. The mechanisms underlying the requirement for glycolytic reprogramming remain incompletely understood. Common assumptions about the connection between aerobic glycolysis and anabolic biomass production or the kinetics of ATP production have not been definitively demonstrated.",89391697-78b2-4f28-8748-77385a7d9096
1,conclusion1," Several key mechanistic insights have been made, such as the role of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in regulating translation of cytokine mRNA and the importance of glycolytic enzymes and metabolites in regulating inflammatory transcriptional programs. Nonetheless, much work remains to fully understand why aerobic glycolysis is required for inflammatory immune functions.  There has been much interest in targeting aerobic glycolysis as a means of fine‐tuning the immune response to treat autoimmune diseases. Treatments targeting aerobic glycolysis take the form of both pharmacologic agents, such as inhibitors of glycolytic enzymes, and dietary interventions, including glucose‐restricted diets such as the ketogenic diet.",f05b03d5-9e3e-4197-b6b5-00863c5fb43d
2,conclusion2," A variety of pharmacologic inhibitors of glycolysis have shown promise in animal models of autoimmune disease, including 2‐deoxyglucose, inhibitors of the glucose transporter GLUT1, and dichloroacetate, which is an inhibitor of the enzyme PDHK1. dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an incompletely understood immunomodulatory drug used to treat psoriasis and MS, was recently shown to produce anti‐inflammatory effects through inhibition of glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and aerobic glycolysis, providing proof of concept that targeting glycolysis is a viable strategy for treating human disease. glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) appears to play a unique regulatory role in Warburg glycolysis, making it an attractive target for selective modulation of glycolysis in activated immune cells without broad metabolic toxicity.",540ee350-56ca-4b3f-bca7-0852371e620a
3,conclusion3," Dietary strategies, including the ketogenic diet as well as restricted‐feeding diets such as CR and IF, have also shown benefit in animal models of autoimmunity and may have a role as adjunct therapy in humans. Although such diets have become highly popular among patients and the healthy lay public alike, evidence for the safety and efficacy of these diets in humans is lacking. Larger and longer studies are required before any of these diets should be recommended to patients.
