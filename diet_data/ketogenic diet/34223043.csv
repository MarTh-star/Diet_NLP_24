0,background0," Growing evidence supports the use of low-carbohydrate/high-fat ketogenic diets as an adjunctive cancer therapy. However, it is unclear which genetic, metabolic, or immunological factors contribute to the beneficial effect of ketogenic diets. Therefore, we investigated the effect of ketogenic diets on the progression and metabolism of genetically and metabolically heterogeneous melanoma xenografts, as well as on the development of melanoma metastases in mice with a functional immune system.

WM47 (BRAFV600E/NRASwt) and WM3311 (BRAF/NRAS/NF1 wild-type) were provided by Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, USA). WM3000 (BRAFwt/NRASQ61R) cells were obtained from Rockland. Super-metastatic B16-M4b cells were produced by several rounds of in vivo selection from B16F10 melanoma cells (ATCC) as previously described [18]. A375, WM47, WM3311, and WM3000 cells were cultured as described previously [14]. B16-M4b cells were cultured in DMEM GLUTAMAX high glucose (61965026, Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% FBS (F7524, Sigma-Aldrich). All cells were tested as mycoplasma free and kept at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.  Proliferation assay  Human melanoma cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2 × 103 cells/well for A375 cells and 4 × 103 cells/well for WM47, WM3311 and WM3000 cells).

3,methods2,"  Melanoma xenografts  Mouse xenograft studies were performed in accordance with the Salzburg Animal Care and Use Committee (Study approval no. 20901-TVG/122/6-2018). Animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and care conformed to the Austria Act on Animal Experimentation. Mice had ad libitum access to water and chow. For the establishment of melanoma xenografts, the human melanoma cell lines A375, WM47, WM3311 and WM3000 were used. 1 × 107 cells in 200 μl of a 1:1 mixture of Matrigel (Corning) and serum-free medium were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of 5- to 7-week-old female CD-1 nude mice (Charles River). Tumor volume was measured every 3–4 days using a caliper and calculated according to the formula: width × height × length/2. In addition, body weight was recorded.",c248d421-c539-48c0-b473-311fbd74346e
4,methods3," Once the tumor volume reached 100 mm3, mice were equally assigned to control (CTRL), long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT) or long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT)-MCT diets (Table S1) (n = 10–13 per group). Blood glucose and BHB levels were monitored at least once per week using the enzyme-based Precision Xceed System (Abbott). WM47 and WM3311 melanoma-bearing mice were euthanized once the tumor volume reached ~ 1000 mm3. A375 and WM3000 melanoma-bearing mice were euthanized once the tumor volume reached 10% of net body weight (2000–2500 mm3). Mice which approached > 20% net body weight loss were euthanized immediately regardless of tumor size. Blood was taken by cardiac puncture, collected in Lithium Heparin tubes and centrifuged for 3 min at 2000×g. Plasma samples were stored at − 80 °C until metabolomics analysis.",f04fc46b-5efa-425b-916d-a567b3c37f3f
5,methods4," Tumors were harvested and divided in two parts of which one half was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80 °C for metabolomics analysis while the other half was formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded for histological analysis.  B16-M4b allografts  B16-M4b allograft studies were conducted under approval of the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) authorities (Comité d’Ethique Facultaire pour l’Expérimentation Animale) according to national animal care regulations (Study approval no. 2016/UCL/MD/018). B16-M4b melanoma allografts were established as described previously [18]. In brief, 100 μl of a 10% Matrigel (Corning)/90% serum free medium cell suspension containing 1 × 106 cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of 8-week-old male C57BL/6j mice (Janvier) (day 0). The size of the primary tumor was measured using an electronic caliper, and the tumor volume was calculated using the formula of a prolate ellipsoid.",da81721d-d537-4f24-a1b0-3972bfad8c05
6,methods5," Once the primary tumor reached a diameter of ~ 10 mm (day 11 ± 1), the tumor was surgically removed. One day after the surgery, mice were equally assigned to the control (CTRL), long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT) or long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT)-MCT diet groups (Table S1) (n = 8–9 per group). Tumor recurrence was monitored after surgery. The size of secondary tumors was measured as described above. In addition, body weight was monitored over time. After 8 days of dietary intervention, blood glucose and BHB levels were measured using the enzyme-based Precision Xceed System (Abbott). Once the secondary tumor of one mouse reached a diameter of ~ 17 mm (day 25 ± 1), all mice were terminally euthanized. Afterwards, lung metastases were counted under a stereoscopic microscope.  Haematoxylin and eosin staining  Formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (4 μm) sections of the xenografts were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE).",80e9e604-010d-4bf7-b01b-71f063211eaa
7,methods6," In brief, after deparaffination, rehydrated tissue sections were incubated for 6 min in Mayer’s haemalum solution (Merck). Counterstaining was performed using a 0.25% Eosin Y (Merck) solution in 70% ethanol. Slides were mounted with Histokitt (Karl Hecht). The percentage of the necrotic area in the tumor sections was scored from 0 to 100% by a pathologist.  Immunohistochemistry  Immunohistochemical staining was performed as described previously [20] using 4-μm deparaffinized tumor sections of A375, WM47, WM3311, and WM3000 xenografts from mice fed a control (CTRL) diet to evaluate differences in mitochondrial respiratory complexes and glycolytic markers. The following antibodies and dilutions were used: anti-NDUFS4 (1:1000, ab137064 Abcam), anti-SDHA (1:2000, ab14715 Abcam), anti-MTCO1 (1:1000, ab14705 Abcam), anti-HK2 (1:200, 2867 Cell Signaling), and anti-GLUT1 (1:600, 21829-1-AP Proteintech).",34fcbe81-70ca-40c7-9f52-c6d695a9d583
8,methods7," For detection, an EnVision kit (Dako) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Scoring of immunohistochemical staining was performed by a pathologist as described previously [13]. For CI, complex II (CII), complex IV (CIV), and HK2 (mitochondrial and cytoplasmic proteins) staining, the staining intensity was scored on a scale of 0–3 (0: no staining; 1: weak staining; 2: moderate staining; 3: strong staining) and multiplied by the percentage of cells stained with the respective intensity to obtain overall score values for statistical analysis as follows: score value = [(0 × Percentage intensity 0) + (1 × Percentage intensity 1) + (2 × Percentage intensity 2) + (3 × Percentage intensity 3)]/100. For GLUT1 (membrane protein) staining, the percentage of positive cells was scored from 0 to 100%.",3ee9386c-751b-4183-9775-cda9c469401f
9,methods8,"  Metabolomics  Targeted metabolic profiling of mouse plasma and xenograft samples was performed using the MxP® Quant 500 kit combined with the UHPLC-MS/MS-based acylcarnitine assay (Biocrates Life Sciences) as described previously [17]. In brief, xenograft tissues were homogenized in 85:15 ethanol:0.01 M phosphate lysis buffer at 4 °C. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000×g for 2 min at 2–4 °C, supernatants were collected and stored at – 80 °C until analysis.  For the MxP® Quant 500 kit, plasma samples and tissue homogenate supernatants were derivatized using a 5% phenyl-isothiocyanate solution prior to metabolite extraction using 5 mM ammonium acetate in methanol. Extracts were analyzed using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC coupled with a Waters TQ-S MS, using electrospray ionization and multiple reaction mode. Amino acids, biogenic amines, and other small molecules were analyzed by liquid chromatography in 2 different injections and lipids were analyzed by flow injection.",3bff6e1f-7024-49cd-8f48-c748357bb06d
10,methods9,"  For the acylcarnitine assay, acylcarnitines were extracted using methanol and extracts were analyzed using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 UPLC system coupled to a TSQTM Vantage MS. All measurements were carried out in positive ion multiple reaction mode.  Data of the MxP® Quant 500 assay were exported and quantified using MetIDQTM software (Biocrates Life Sciences). Raw data files of the acylcarnitine assay were generated by using XcaliburTM software (Thermo Fisher) and exported to MetIDQTM for further analysis, including peak integration, retention time correction, area calculation, calibration curve preparation, and concentration calculation.  Data for tumor tissue were normalized using the tissue factor in MetIDQTM. Quality control samples-based data normalization was performed to minimize the variation of analyses.",7d22ff80-85f8-4875-bb79-2ca3593cd5f2
11,methods10," Initial data cleaning was performed by excluding metabolites with > 20% missing values or values below the limit of detection (limit of detection (LOD)) in all experimental groups. Thus, all metabolites with > 80% of the concentration values above the limit of detection (LOD) in at least one of the experimental groups were included for statistical analysis. Remaining missing values were replaced by 1/5 of the minimum positive value of each variable once data were analyzed using the web-based tool MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca).  Data analysis  Univariate and multivariate analyses of normalized and log-transformed metabolomics data were carried out using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca) [21].

12,methods11,"  For metabolomics data, significant changes in metabolite levels were identified by one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher´s LSD post hoc test. To minimize false positives, false discovery rates (FDRs) were calculated based on the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [22]. FDR-corrected p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Unsupervised principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) was performed whenever necessary to determine group separation. To increase the robustness of our analyses, we filtered plasma as well as tumor metabolites and lipids based on FDR-corrected p values < 0.05 for control (CTRL) vs. long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT) and control (CTRL) vs. long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT)-MCT and focused on those metabolites that were significantly altered by both KDs in all four melanoma models (A375, WM47, WM3311, and WM3000).",0f24cf4f-c56e-44e3-8f57-cc93ea73f93d
13,methods12," For metabolic pathway analysis (MetPA) of differential metabolites, we only considered metabolites that were significantly altered by both KDs and grouped long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT) and long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT)-MCT samples together. The Mus musculus and Homo sapiens KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway library was used as a reference for MetPA of mouse plasma metabolites and human melanoma cell xenograft tissue metabolites, respectively. Heatmaps were created using MetaboAnalyst 5.0, and Venn diagrams were generated by using the http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn website. To identify metabolites (biomarkers) which are increased in melanoma-bearing mice compared to non-tumor mice (non tumor mice (NTM)) and normalized by KDs, correlation analysis using the Pattern Search tool of MetaboAnalyst was performed [23].",a6b10464-9cbc-4160-8607-b01cd49f11b3
14,methods13," The predefined pattern “1–2–1–1” used for the Pattern Search corresponds to concentrations of metabolites of the different groups in the following order: “non tumor mice (NTM) control (CTRL) (1)–melanoma control (CTRL) (2)–melanoma long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT) (1)–melanoma long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT)-MCT (1)”, while “2” indicates higher metabolite concentrations than “1”.

15,results0," Ketogenic diets slow the growth of melanoma xenografts independently of oncogenic driver and metabolic signature  To examine the effect of KDs on melanoma growth, we established BRAF mutant (A375 and WM47), BRAF/NRAS/NF1 wild-type (WM3311), and NRAS mutant (WM3000) xenografts in CD-1 nude mice. As previously reported, A375, WM47, WM3311, and WM3000 cells differ in their glycolytic and respiratory activities [14] and have distinct metabolic profiles [17]. Moreover, the expression levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)) complexes CI, complex II (CII), and complex IV (CIV), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and hexokinase 2 (HK2) varied substantially across xenografts (Fig. S1).",03b0c389-c378-4d7b-8789-d85eba5675f9
16,results1," Since the fat content of KDs can influence their antitumor efficacy [24], we investigated the effect of two KDs (long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT) and long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT)-MCT, ratio of fat to the sum of carbohydrate and protein of 8:1, Table S1) on melanoma growth. Compared to the control (CTRL) diet, the long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT)-based KD slowed the growth of A375, WM3311, and WM3000 xenografts (Fig. 1A, C–E, G, 1H and Fig. S2), and also tended to reduce the growth rate of WM47 xenografts (0.05 < p ≤ 0.10) (Fig. 1B, F and Fig. S2). The long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT)-MCT-based KD slowed the growth of A375 and WM3311 xenografts and tended to lower the growth rate of WM3000 xenografts (Fig. 1A, C–E, G, H and Fig. S2). Both KDs increased the level of necrosis in A375 and WM3000 tumors compared to control (CTRL) (Fig. S3).",266ac690-aa0e-4631-809e-1194f578dad3
17,results2," Overall, the KDs exerted antiproliferative effects irrespective of the underlying melanoma driver mutations and metabolic plasticity. The influence of the KDs on body weight was quite heterogeneous among melanoma-bearing mice (Fig. 1I–L and Fig. S4). For instance, the body weight of A375- and WM3000-bearing mice was stable or increased in all groups throughout the dietary intervention, whereas WM47- and WM3311-bearing mice lost weight over time, and the weight loss was more pronounced in the KD groups. However, we observed no significant correlation between tumor volume and body weight of WM47- and WM3311-bearing mice (Fig. 1N, O). Thus, the observed antitumor effects of the KDs occurred independently of body weight changes. Since weight reduction > 20% led to the removal of the respective animals, survival analysis based on tumor growth was not possible for the WM47 and WM3311 xenografts.",da267f10-8561-4646-b09a-66d3705f3ba8
18,results3," Nevertheless, the long chain triglyceride based KD (LCT)-based KD prolonged the survival of weight-stable A375- and WM3000-bearing mice (Fig. 1M, P).Fig. 1 Ketogenic diets slow the growth of melanoma xenografts independently of oncogenic driver and metabolic signature.

Both KDs reduced blood glucose levels by an average of 31% (range 24–48%) (Fig. 2A–D). However, a significant correlation between plasma glucose level and xenograft size was observed only for WM3000-bearing mice (Fig. 2E–H). The ketone body BHB was increased by both KDs by an average of 525% (range 441–651%) in melanoma-bearing mice (Fig. 2I–L).",0a9956e9-e60e-419c-8b02-4c763579cc31
21,results6," Whereas MCT-supplementation of KDs has been reported to enhance ketone body levels in humans [27], we did not observe this effect in the present study. Furthermore, we did not find a negative correlation between plasma BHB level and xenograft size in KD-fed mice (Fig. 2M–P). Treatment of A375, WM47, WM3311, and WM3000 cells with 2.5, 5, and 10 mM BHB in vitro did not impact their proliferation (Fig. S5). Acetoacetic acid (AcAc), the metabolic precursor of BHB was recently reported to confer tumor-accelerating effects of a KD in BRAF mutant melanoma-bearing mice [4]. We also treated the melanoma cell lines with the lithium salt form of AcAc (LiAcAc), which is more stable than the acid form, as well as the control salt (LiCl) in vitro.",006cc97e-2be4-44a9-9fe2-841fad4843ae

To evaluate how KDs influence the tumor metabolome, we also profiled polar metabolites in melanoma xenografts.  In xenografts, we were able to quantify 62 polar metabolites (Table S7), of which 18, 21, 16, and 26 were found to be significantly different in at least 2 dietary intervention groups in the A375, WM47, WM3311, and WM3000 xenografts, respectively (Table S8).

49,discussion0," Metabolic reprogramming in melanoma cells is strongly linked to the constitutive activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K signaling induced by driver mutations such as BRAF and NRAS mutants, leading to various metabolic phenotypes [9, 11, 12, 17]. The four melanoma xenografts used in the present study vary in their metabolome [17] and in their expression levels of respiratory and glycolytic markers. However, despite this genetic and phenotypic variation, our present findings suggest that KDs could be an effective antitumor therapy against melanomas generally.  In contrast to our data, Xia et al. reported a growth-accelerating effect of a KD on BRAF mutant xenografts (including A375), whereas NRAS and wild-type melanomas were unaffected [4].",8d057bab-7558-46d2-a28d-43141eccf9e5
50,discussion1," The authors attributed the tumor-promoting effect to the ketone body AcAc, which was increased by the KD and enhanced the binding of mutant BRAF (but not wild-type BRAF) to MEK1 to promote MEK-ERK signaling and tumor growth [4]. Two major differences distinguish our work from that of Xia et al. First, the authors in that study observed a significant increase in AcAc but not BHB in KD-fed mice (ketogenic ratio 6:1) [4]. Since BHB is the most abundant ketone body in the blood during ketosis, it seems their xenograft-bearing mice did not reach a high level of diet-induced ketosis. In our study, the level of plasma BHB increased by an average of 6.2-fold in KD-fed melanoma-bearing mice (ketogenic ratio 8:1). In previous studies, CD-1 nude mice fed a KD with a ketogenic ratio of 2:1 also exhibited increased BHB [29, 30]. Thus, the 6:1 ketogenic ratio used by Xia and colleagues does not explain the lack of BHB elevation.",7d975680-ef81-4a16-aede-275d266e6a37
51,discussion2," Second, our study design aimed to mimic a therapeutic setting to test the effect of KDs on melanoma growth in vivo. We started the KD intervention once the xenografts had reached a measurable size, approximately 1 week after tumor cell injection. In contrast, Xia et al. randomized mice to dietary intervention groups 1 week before tumor initiation [4]. Consistent with our data, de Groot et al. demonstrated reduced tumor growth of BRAF-inhibitor-sensitive and BRAF-inhibitor-resistant A375 melanoma xenografts in mice fed with KD [6]. Interestingly, the authors used exactly the same KD as Xia et al. but started KD intervention after tumor cell injection as we did. Thus, the timing of KD administration may significantly influence the response, which needs to be addressed in further studies [31].  Ferrere et al. showed that plasma BHB levels negatively correlated with the size of transgenically induced melanomas in mice treated with a KD (ketogenic ratio 4:1) [5].",9e885389-cc37-4569-aa1b-ae028529f468
52,discussion3," The authors confirmed the mode of action by replacing the KD with BHB administration, which slowed tumor growth to the same extent as the KD. Consequently, BHB was concluded to be the bioactive metabolite of the KD, exerting its antiproliferative effect by influencing the tumor-associated T cell activity [5]. In contrast, we observed no correlation between plasma BHB levels of melanoma-bearing mice and tumor size. Our data suggest that neither BHB nor AcAc has a direct effect on melanoma cell proliferation. Moreover, in our xenograft model, the antiproliferative effects of KDs cannot be attributed to a T cell response because the CD-1 immune-compromised mice that we used lack T cells. Treatment of immunocompetent syngeneic B16-M4b-bearing mice with KDs after primary tumor removal only tended to reduce recurrent tumor growth, even though plasma BHB levels were elevated. Thus, a BHB-mediated immune response does not explain how KDs reduce tumor growth.",152ce2be-936f-4f28-978e-618b5ca7f071
53,discussion4," One reason for the insignificant effect of KDs on the secondary growth of B16-M4b-allografts could be the aggressiveness of the model or because the KDs were applied as a monotherapy, as opposed to an adjunct therapy. However, fewer B16-M4b-bearing KD- than control (CTRL)-fed mice developed lung metastases, indicating that KDs not only affect primary tumor growth but can also reduce metastasis. This is consistent with findings in mice injected with B16 melanoma cells via the tail vein and subsequently fed either sucrose or pure vegetable oil, in which mice provided vegetable oil displayed a ~ 66% reduction in lung metastases [32].  Our KDs reduced the plasma levels of several EAAs, which is in agreement with previous studies showing that KDs have a profound effect on amino acid metabolism [24, 33, 34]. One common feature of cancers, including melanomas, is the upregulation of EAA transporters to meet the high EAA demand necessary for proliferation [35, 36].",e3ffbf4a-ba8e-41a9-aba7-fd9da3dd36a4
54,discussion5," The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) valine, leucine and isoleucine can serve as alternative carbon fuels for the TCA cycle, and mediate lipogenesis through acetyl-CoA [37, 38]. Elevated levels of circulating BCAAs and increased expression of BCAA-metabolizing enzymes in tumors were found in patients with various cancers, indicating an increased requirement for BCAAs as anaplerotic substrates [39]. Accordingly, leucine deprivation triggers apoptotic death in melanoma cells [40]. Thus, reduced availability of EAAs, including BCAAs in the blood induced by KDs might directly impair tumor survival [41, 42]. One plausible explanation for why KDs reduce EAA levels could be their lower protein content compared to control (CTRL) diets (Table S1).",1cb0c78e-7981-4d17-a934-3a416bed8641
55,discussion6," However, in a previous study we found neither a reduction of plasma EAA levels nor a reduction in tumor growth rate in neuroblastoma-bearing mice fed a control diet containing the same low amount and the same source of protein as used in the KD in the present study [24]. Thus, KDs used in the present and previous study have a potent effect on EAA metabolism irrespective of their low protein content.  MetPA revealed that KDs altered lysine degradation both in plasma and in xenografts. Lysine is a pivotal EAA, since lysine-rich proteins include ones indispensable for cellular structure and function (e.g., ribosome assembly) [41]. Since lysine is required to synthesize homoarginine from arginine [43], the reduced availability of lysine could probably explain the reduction in homoarginine levels observed in plasma and tumors. In addition, the level of alpha-amino adipic acid, a product of lysine metabolism, was reduced by the KDs in both plasma and xenografts.",b2e41d84-90a6-45db-bbd1-f0f7c55f2442
56,discussion7," Compared to tumor-free mice, melanoma-bearing mice showed increased levels of alpha-amino adipic acid in plasma which got reversed by the KDs. Alpha-amino adipic acid served as a biomarker to distinguish mouse embryonic fibroblasts with and without deficiency in the oncogene KLF4 [44]. Moreover, alpha-amino adipic acid has been reported as a prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer [45]. Furthermore, high levels of alpha-amino adipic acid correlated with poor survival of patients with glioblastoma [46]. However, whether the antiproliferative effects of KDs on melanoma cells relate to reductions in lysine and its related metabolites homoarginine and alpha-amino adipic acid remains to be elucidated.  Numerous alterations of the lipid metabolic network are known to contribute to sustained cell proliferation and melanoma metastasis [47].",c274e002-d1e7-4fd3-8876-ef9e51fc4941
57,discussion8," We observed major differences among the melanoma xenografts in terms of sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid species, which are bioactive molecules important for plasma membrane homeostasis [17]. Even though melanoma subtypes present heterogeneous lipid profiles, our KDs consistently upregulated the levels of lipids of different classes in the plasma of melanoma-bearing mice. Notably, the plasma concentrations of the majority of sphingomyelins were increased by the KDs. Enriched sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolites were also observed in the plasma of patients who consumed a KD for 2 weeks [48]. sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), the enzyme which produces sphingomyelins from ceramides and phosphatidylcholines, is often downregulated in melanoma and this is associated with worse outcomes [49]. KDs increased the ratio of plasma sphingomyelins to ceramides as well as to phosphatidylcholines, potentially indicating increased sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) activity.",1426cae0-3484-4926-9e26-08465606b4f4
58,discussion9," In the xenografts, the ratio of hydroxylated to non-hydroxylated sphingomyelins as well as acylcarnitines was elevated by our KDs. Reduced expression of fatty acid 2-hydroxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes hydroxylation of free fatty acids prior to their incorporation into 2-hydroxylated sphingolipids [50], was detected in tumor tissue from colorectal and gastric cancer patients [51, 52]. Fatty acid 2-hydroxylation suppressed colorectal tumorigenesis and metastasis in vitro and inhibited gastric cancer growth by increasing sensitivity to cisplatin in mice [51, 52]. Thus, the present data suggest that KDs could exert antitumor effects via significant alterations in sphingomyelin metabolism and hydroxylation of certain lipid species.  Conclusions  Taken together, our data indicate that KDs induce antitumor effects toward melanoma and affect different metabolic pathways concomitantly, creating an unfavorable metabolic environment for cancer cell proliferation.",6dd3fe1d-a8fd-40bf-b3cf-576a7bf81d45
59,discussion10," The effects of our KDs on the body weight of melanoma-bearing mice appear to depend more on the cell lines injected than on the diet itself. Several clinical studies reported weight reduction in cancer patients adhering to a KD; however, the KDs were sufficient to preserve lean mass while reducing total fat mass in these patients [53–55]. Importantly, KDs induced weight gain and maintenance of a positive nitrogen balance in cachectic cancer patients [56]. A clear benefit of KDs is their reported potential to sensitize tumor cells to chemo- and radiotherapy [2]. Thus, combining KDs with BRAF/MEK or PI3K inhibitors may synergize with the tumor-reductive effect exerted by KDs as a monotherapy in our study. Compared to anticancer drugs and standard treatments, KDs are inexpensive, fairly easy to implement when monitored appropriately, and well tolerated, which leads us to propose KDs as part of a multimodal therapy to improve the outcomes of classic cancer therapy [57–59].",42c5b11d-7adc-4b36-a252-29dfa27a0320
