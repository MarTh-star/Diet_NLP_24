0,introduction0,"In high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (LCKDs), glucose intake is limited, and fat is preferentially utilized by the body as the main energy source. This is associated with favorable effects with respect to lifestyle-related diseases, resulting in improvement of hyperglycemia and suppression of excessive insulin secretion1,2. Research using animal models has revealed that the underlying molecular mechanism of LCKDs involves changes in the metabolism of amino acids3, carbohydrates4, and lipids2,4–8 in the liver. Using hyperphagic obese (B6.Cg-Lepob/J) mice, we established a LCKD feeding model suitable for evaluating the effects of the diet and reported that the LCKD alters the expression of various liver proteins2,4 and lipids2,8.  Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids containing sialic acids in the oligosaccharide (Fig. 1). Mammalian cells produce a wide variety of gangliosides that are characterized by their oligosaccharide structure and vary by cell species9.",e556ca9a-89e5-48e3-bb96-a3a737ed850d
1,introduction1," Monosialoganglioside GM3 is a major component of the mammalian ganglioside backbone, and a recent study revealed that humans harboring a mutation in St3gal5 gene encoding α2,3-sialyltransferase 5/GM3 synthase, a key enzyme in GM3 synthesis, develop autosomal recessive infantile-onset symptomatic epilepsy syndrome10. Hereditary spastic paraplegia is known to be associated with mutations in the B4galnt1 gene encoding β1,4-N-acetylgalactosyltransferase 1/GM2 synthase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of gangliosides with long oligosaccharides (complex gangliosides) that are abundant in central nervous system tissues11. These findings indicate that deficiencies in complex gangliosides synthesized by GM3 synthase and GM2 synthase can trigger the onset of epileptic seizure disorder. In addition, abnormal insulin signaling has been observed in mutant mice with GM3 synthase and ganglioside deficiencies12–14, indicating that gangliosides modulate insulin signaling in vivo.",6a50ae86-e4b9-430c-9961-1b93abb82e85
2,introduction2,"Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the mammalian ganglioside synthesis pathway. Genes encoding ganglioside metabolism-related proteins analyzed in this study are shown in italics.    In the present study, we examined the underlying molecular basis of LCKDs by profiling gene expression in the liver using our established LCKD (F3666, a particular LCKD for rodents)-fed mice. We found that the LCKD affected the expression of ganglioside metabolism-related genes. The LCKD promoted the expression of ganglioside glycosyltransferase genes, including St3gal5 and B4galnt1, and suppressed the expression of Gm2a, which encodes the GM2 ganglioside activator protein (GM2AP), a lysosomal protein necessary for the degradation of complex gangliosides15–17. These changes in gene expression were correlated with ganglioside content in the liver and serum and resulted in an increase in ganglioside levels.",9ca06cb2-3e8b-40ba-84d4-a0cdb6031bdf
3,introduction3," We also analyzed the effects of the LCKD on gene expression in the cerebral cortex, a major tissue expressing gangliosides, and found a significant decrease in Gm2a expression. Although the change was not associated with ganglioside levels in cerebral cortex, this result raised a possibility that the diet altered ganglioside metabolism in a limited area of central nervous system tissues.

14,results0,"Overall effects of the LCKD on expression of hepatic genes B6.Cg-Lepob/J mice fed a LCKD2 were used in this study. Our initial purpose was to analyze the effect of LCKD on improvement of the hyperglycemic phenotype of this mice at molecular levels2. As this mouse is known to apparently exhibit hyperglycemia in around 10 weeks old under being fed a diet of regular chow18, we used this duration (5–12 weeks) for the dietary experiment. We found that LCKD feeding efficiently improved hyperglycemic phenotype of female B6.Cg-Lepob/J mouse during this duration2, thus we determined these as the experimental condition for this study. The primary phenotype in this model was improvement in the hyperglycemic phenotype in the B6.Cg-Lepob/J mice and production of ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate), whereas dietary intake and body weight gain were unchanged between chow-fed and LCKD-fed mice2.",9ab13363-87c4-46ac-8c06-e1b26fcc253e
15,results1," Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 detail the phenotypes of the mice used in this study, and all mice were confirmed as exhibiting these phenotypes. Hepatomegaly due to the accumulation of neutral fats, as observed in chow-fed mice, was suppressed in LCKD-fed mice as reported previously2,8. Compared to chow-fed mice, the liver weight and total amount of triglycerides decreased by less than 25% in LCKD-fed mice.  The liver was collected after 7 continuous weeks on the LCKD, and the expression levels of hepatic genes were comprehensively analyzed using an Agilent Expression Microarray. The data for all genes detected as certain signals were compared with data for mice fed regular chow (n = 3) and deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession number GSE115342.

16,results2," Genes exhibiting a marked change in expression (log2 ratio > 4 and <−4, P < 0.01) are listed in Table 1. Changes in the expression of these extracted genes were verified using real-time PCR with a greater number of samples (n = 6), and genes for which expression was strongly affected by the LCKD were identified (Fig. 2). The genes most strongly affected were those encoding de novo lipogenic enzymes for triglyceride synthesis, which previous research showed to be suppressed by LCKDs5,7,19. Among these genes, the expression of Scd1 and Scd3, which encode fatty acid desaturases, and Elovl6, which encodes a fatty acid elongase, was strongly suppressed by the LCKD. In addition to the genes extracted from the microarray results, real-time PCR analyses also confirmed a significant suppression of expression of the Acaca gene, which encodes the rate-determining enzyme in the fatty acid synthesis pathway, and a tendency toward suppression of expression of Fasn, which encodes fatty acid synthase.",7a36e769-47e6-4d24-ae2d-4cad5ab2cf5b
17,results3," Decreased levels of posttranslational products for these genes have been reported in this LCKD model2,8. As these lipogenic genes are targets of insulin20 and the LCKD decreases blood insulin levels, the down-regulation of these genes is primarily due to the LCKD-induced decrease in insulin levels. Expression levels of the Nnmt and Asns genes are also known to be affected by the LCKD3,21, and this was also observed in this analysis. The LCKD down-regulates the expression of Nnmt, which encodes nicotinamide methyltransferase, and up-regulates Asns, which encodes asparagine synthetase. Blood levels of liver-secreted hormone encoded by Fgf21 also increase in animals fed a LCKD5–7,22, and a tendency toward up-regulation in LCKD-fed mice was indicated in the present study by real-time PCR analysis.Table 1 Results of Agilent Expression Microarray analysis of hepatic gene expression in LCKD-fed mice.",94c1341a-d20e-4544-89d9-527be9c9ab8a

19,results6," By contrast, expression of Psat1, which encodes serine aminotransferase, and Fut1, which encodes fucosyltransferase 1 involved in synthesis of the blood group H (O) antigen25, was strongly enhanced by the LCKD. The Tmprss4, Dct, and Psat1 genes are thought to regulate cellular levels of the glycogenic amino acids serine and tyrosine and contribute to gluconeogenesis in the liver of LCKD-fed mice. Fucosyltransferase 1 catalyzes the α1,2-fucosylation of the oligosaccharides of glycosphingolipids and glycoproteins and generates the blood group H (O) antigen25,26. As fucosylated glycosphingolipids were not detected in the present study, Fut1 might be involved in the synthesis of fucosylated glycoproteins in the liver.  Effects of the LCKD on expression of ganglioside metabolism-related genes in the liver We noted that among the genes extracted by the microarray analysis, LCKD affected the expression levels of various ganglioside metabolism-related genes, including St3gal5 and B4galnt1.",6492ee66-c25d-4ffc-b290-b0a622b122b3
20,results7," Mutations in St3gal5 and B4galnt1 are associated with inherited epileptic seizure disorders in humans10,11, suggesting that these genes play roles in the LCKD-associated suppression of epilepsy1. We therefore focused on changes in the expression of ganglioside metabolism-related genes in this study. Microarray analyses showed that the LCKD significantly up-regulated the expression of the ganglioside glycosyltransferase genes Ugcg, St3gal5, B4galnt1, and St3gal2, which encode ceramide glucosyltransferase27, GM3 synthase28–30, GM2 synthase31, and α2,3-sialyltransferase 2/GD1a synthase32, respectively (Table 1). By contrast, LCKD suppressed the expression of Gm2a, which encodes GM2AP15,16, a lysosomal protein indispensable for complex ganglioside degradation. GM2AP degrades complex gangliosides in lysosomes in cooperation with β-hexosaminidase A, a product of the Hexa and Hexb genes17.

22,results9,"    Effect of the LCKD on ganglioside content in the liver and serum Changes in the expression levels of St3gal5, St3gal2 and Gm2a were suggestive of increased expression of liver gangliosides. Our previous results obtained by thin-layer chromatography of hepatic lipids in this model mouse showed LCKD effect on the expression of the liver gangliosides8, which supported this idea. However, ganglioside has diversity in its oligosaccharide structure, and a number of genes regulate the structural diversity of gangliosides. Previously, we used crude preparations of liver gangliosides for analysis8. Thus, we couldn’t verify the relationship between expression change of each genes and corresponding ganglioside synthesis in liver. In the current study, in order to clarify the relationship, we performed HPLC analysis to show more detail alteration of each molecular species of liver gangliosides.",43dbc02c-44e1-4a45-b9f1-b8a3938be323
23,results10," Thus, we analyzed hepatic gangliosides using a semi-quantitative HPLC approach with an oligosaccharide fluorescent labeling method (Fig. 4). In this analysis, the ceramide portion of the gangliosides was removed using Rhodococcus triatomea endoglycoceramidase I (EGCase I)33, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the β-glycosidic linkage between oligosaccharides and ceramides in various glycosphingolipids. The released oligosaccharides were then sequentially labeled with anthranilic acid (2-AA). The 2-AA-labeled oligosaccharides were analyzed by HPLC, with the fluorescence intensity of the 2-AA serving as a measure of the amount of each ganglioside. These analyses indicated that the gangliosides contained GM2 as the primary component and GM3, GM1, and GD1 as minor components. The gangliosides primarily contained Neu5Gc as the sialic acid (shown as GM2-Gc, GM3-Gc, and GM1-Gc), but Neu5Ac was also detected.",81ae9cfa-25a4-4143-9270-071fb4e73196
24,results11," Collectively, these analyses indicated that the LCKD induced an increase of >3-fold in the expression of all hepatic gangliosides except GD1a. As gangliosides produced in the liver are secreted into the blood, we also analyzed the serum ganglioside content by HPLC. GM2-Gc, GM1-Gc, and GD1a were detected in the serum, and levels of GM1-Gc and GD1a were significantly increased in mice fed the LCKD. These results indicate that up-regulation of St3gal5 and St3gal2 by LCKD promotes synthesis of GM3 and GD1a respectively, and down-regulation of Gm2a promotes increase of GM2 and its derivatives in liver.Figure 4 HPLC analysis of ganglioside levels in liver and serum of LCKD-fed mice.

29,discussion0,"This study revealed that a LCKD promotes the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of liver gangliosides and suppress the expression of Gm2a, which is involved in the degradation of GM2 and complex gangliosides. These changes are correlated with an increase in ganglioside content in the liver, indicating that LCKDs promote ganglioside synthesis in tissues via the transcriptional regulation of ganglioside metabolism-related genes. Our previous data8 had been suggested that LCKD effect on the synthesis of liver gangliosides, and this study using gene expression profiling and HPLC ganglioside analysis revealed that details of mechanism of LCKD effect on the synthesis of liver gangliosides. In particular, the finding that ganglioside synthesis can be regulated by the gene expression level of its degradation factor, is conceptually new in tissue ganglioside metabolism.",9d9710d8-a78c-40da-b129-5fbd90919e0b
30,discussion1,"  We previously showed that the expression of gangliosides is promoted by treating cells with a glucose starvation mimetic37. This suggests that the decreased carbohydrate intake associated with LCKDs induces an increase in hepatic ganglioside expression. Although we analyzed the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by this mimetic37–40, no clear answer was obtained. It will therefore be necessary to employ a new approach based on the results of the present study. The LCKD-fed mice model using this study was designed for analysis of effect of low glucose supply to tissues by LCKD2. Thus, the further analysis using this model is a valid approach to the mechanism. Although we did observe changes in the expression levels of insulin target genes in this LCKD model, a number of previous studies have not found an effect of insulin on the transcription of ganglioside synthase genes.",4c4f3974-9908-4e24-aadd-b17b35e79a03
31,discussion2,"  Gangliosides are known to modulate the function of membrane proteins9, and deficiency or excessive accumulation of gangliosides can lead to several pathologic conditions, including oncogenic transformation41, insulin resistance42, obesity43, and neurologic diseases17,44. An appropriate amount of ganglioside is necessary for maintaining the integrity of cellular membranes43; thus, a modest increase in levels of tissue gangliosides induced by a LCKD could contribute to cell and tissue soundness.  Increased levels of liver gangliosides GD1a and GM1-Gc were also detected in the serum of mice fed the LCKD. As no significant increase in GD1a level was detected in the liver, highly hydrophilic gangliosides with long oligosaccharides could be secreted into the plasma from the liver. By contrast, the level of GM2-Gc, the major ganglioside, was increased in the liver of LCKD-fed mice but not significantly increased in the serum, indicating that GM2-Gc tends to remain in the liver.",25ab39e4-37c0-4109-a195-38328ddcfcfd
32,discussion3," We therefore believe that the plasma ganglioside content can be utilized as an index of the effect of LCKDs on tissue ganglioside metabolism.  We previously found a unique phenotype in LCKD-fed mice: hepatomegaly due to the accumulation of neutral fats, as observed in chow-fed mice, was suppressed in LCKD-fed mice2. In chow-fed mice, the weight of the liver increased more than 3-fold as compared with the liver of LCKD-fed mice2,8, but both groups exhibited similar gains in body weight (Supplementary Fig. S2). This phenotype is unique in that feeding of LCKD promotes obesity whereas only steatosis is prevented in in the mice. Levels of gangliosides, which are thought to regulate insulin signaling12–14, were increased in LCKD-fed mice (Fig. 4), in contrast to triglyceride and cholesterol levels, which decreased2,8.",746d1ab8-2520-40e4-9a64-c69eb0e4125f
33,discussion4," One of the causes of triglyceride accumulation in the liver of chow-fed mice is hyper-activation of the de novo lipogenic pathway mediated by insulin signaling2, and this is also associated with abnormal modifications of insulin signaling modulators4. As these abnormalities do not occur in mice fed a LCKD2,4, the LCKD-induced increase in ganglioside levels likely acts to normalize insulin signaling and thus suppress the development of fatty liver.  The LCKD had no effect on the expression levels of gangliosides in the cerebral cortex, but down-regulation of Gm2a expression was detected, as in the liver. In mice with a Gm2a gene disruption, neuronal storage of gangliosides occurs only in restricted regions of the brain, such as the piriform, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamic nuclei, and cerebellum15. This observation suggests that the LCKD-induced down-regulation of Gm2a observed in the present study should lead to increases in the ganglioside content in these areas.",18e7ae68-10d7-43db-9f04-838d7ca1566e
34,discussion5," To examine this hypothesis, we preliminary investigated ganglioside levels in cerebellum of LCKD-fed mice by HPLC (Supplementary Fig. S4). The result showed a tendency toward higher levels of GD1a and its derivatives in the cerebellum of LCKD-fed mice, which supported our hypothesis. However, GD2 in the same sample showed a decreasing tendency that could not be explained by down-regulation of Gm2a. Further investigation will thus be required to fully elucidate the effect of LCKDs on central nervous system tissues.  In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that LCKDs induce increased expression of tissue gangliosides via transcriptional regulation of ganglioside metabolism-related genes. The effects of the diet are reflected in the ganglioside content in liver, serum, and may involve in the limited area of central nervous system tissues susceptible to Gm2a.
