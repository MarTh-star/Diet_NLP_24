0,introduction0,"Mitochondrial disorders are among the most common inherited metabolic diseases affecting approximately 1 in 2,000–5,000 individuals (Skladal et al, 2003; Thorburn, 2004). These disorders are most often caused by dysfunction of the oxidative phosphorylation (of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)) system, which comprises the enzymes of the respiratory chain (RC) and the ATP synthase embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These molecular micromachines transform the nutrient energy to ATP, the common energy currency of cells. RC deficiency can be caused by mutations in nuclear genes, encoding proteins involved in RC synthesis, assembly, structure, or maintenance, or by primary mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).",33955fa4-587e-412f-9d96-96e702a2fcc8
1,introduction1," Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO)) is a common manifestation of adult‐onset mitochondrial myopathy (MM), often caused by sporadic heteroplasmic single deletions, point mutations of mtDNA, or multiple mtDNA deletions caused secondarily by mutation of nuclear genes involved in mtDNA maintenance (Ylikallio & Suomalainen, 2012). MM manifests typically in the early adulthood, with progressive ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and exercise intolerance (Zeviani et al, 1989). Many patients benefit from palliative care, including surgical blepharoplasty, but no curative treatments exist.  Low‐carbohydrate ketogenic diet has been utilized to treat refractory epilepsies in children and has also been shown to reduce seizures in individuals with mitochondrial disease (Kang et al, 2007; Joshi et al, 2009).",5ec0e36d-3262-458d-949e-713f55ad9f37
2,introduction2," It also has been evaluated as a therapy for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, while a form of ketogenic diet, Atkins diet, is used widely for weight loss (for a review, see Paoli et al, 2013). The diet reduces blood glucose and improves insulin responses and lipid profiles in healthy adults (Westman et al, 2002) as well as in diabetic individuals (Gumbiner et al, 1996; Boden et al, 2005) and has been considered relatively safe.  We have previously shown that in MM mice, ketogenic diet can slow down progression of the disease and improve metabolic and lipidomic parameters (Ahola‐Erkkila et al, 2010). Encouraged by the beneficial effects in mice, we performed a pilot study in progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO)/MM patients, as well as for age‐ and gender‐matched voluntary controls with ketogenic “modified Atkins diet” (mAD).",80a3503c-f083-481d-bf2e-dd3b737ccef9
3,introduction3," We demonstrate that mAD can dramatically modify the disease course of adult‐onset MM by inducing muscle damage, especially targeting respiratory chain‐deficient fibers. The patients recovered well and showed a moderate long‐term increase in muscle strength. ",8db9a722-6d9d-40ec-8e69-36a9f865698f

5,methods1,"  Muscle strength and performance analyses Muscle strength of the patients was analyzed before and after mAD by Medical Research Council score (Hahn et al, 1996), grip strength by Martin Vigorimeter, and isometric muscle strength with “Good strength” analyzer (Metitur Oy, Finland) (Era et al, 1992), including elbow flexion and extension, lower leg extension, and grip strength on both sides. In addition, the patients were tested for balance (standing with one foot), walking for 6 min, static strength of back muscles, and repetitive strength of stomach and upper limb muscles. In addition, a “muscle symptom score” was determined by questionnaire, designed to assess the main symptoms of progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) patients, and RAND‐36 questionnaire was utilized to assess their general quality of life (Hays et al, 1993).",036a4aa2-b819-4b3c-8713-f63ffb259f97
6,methods2," In “muscle symptom score” questionnaire, patients were asked to score their muscle pain in scores of “not at all, mild, moderate, greatly, very greatly” in “rest, activity, numbness, muscle tiredness, muscle weakness, muscle cramps”. Patients were also asked to use the same scoring to identify the muscles that have symptoms “calf and leg, thigh, upper limbs, back and body, neck, head, eyelids and muscles moving of the eyes”.  Laboratory examinations Laboratory examinations were taken after overnight fasting: blood count, alanine aminotransferase, asparate aminotransferase, glutamyl transferase, cholesterol, high‐density lipoprotein, low‐density lipoprotein, triglycerides, creatine kinase (CK), lactate, pyruvate, creatinine, urea, FGF‐21, glucose, insulin, ketones, and blood gases. FGF‐21 was analyzed using BioVendor human FGF21 ELISA kit.

9,methods5,"  Muscle sampling and histological analysis A Bergström needle biopsy from vastus lateralis muscle was taken before and after mAD (Fig 1A). The muscle samples for DNA, RNA, and protein analyses were snap‐frozen in liquid nitrogen, and samples for histology were snap‐frozen in liquid nitrogen‐cooled isopentane. All samples were stored at −80°C. Muscle samples for electron microscopy (EM) were fixed in glutaraldehyde. Eight‐micrometer‐thick frozen muscle sections were tested for cytochrome c oxidase (COX)/succinate dehydrogenase (sections were tested for cytochrome c oxidase (COX)/succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)) activities by standard histochemical activity assay.

Peroxidase stainings were done with VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit (Vector Laboratories) for caspase and LC3 and with Multimer kit Ultraview Universal DAB detection system (Ventana Medical Systems). Transmission electron microscopy sample preparation and analysis was done as previously described (Ahola‐Erkkila et al, 2010). A total of 70–190 cells per patient were counted from ultrathin sections, stained with toluidine blue, to determine the proportion of muscle fibers showing signs of cell death.  RNA analysis Total muscle RNA was extracted with standard TRIzol and chloroform method and purified with RNA purification kit (RNeasy; Qiagen).",8089756c-6177-48dc-bb8e-06c77ec65f3f
11,methods7," A total of 250 ng of total RNA from four progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) patients and eight controls was used for global gene expression analysis on the HumanHT‐12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina) with TotalPrep RNA Labeling Kit (Ambion). Chipster v2.1.0 software was used for quantile normalization (http://chipster.github.io/chipster/). Data were further filtered by coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean; 50% of all present genes were filtered out). To determine the differently expressed genes between progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) or controls on ND and after mAD, paired empirical Bayes statistical test was applied together with the Benjamini–Hochberg P‐value adjustment method.

All genes with log2 fold change > 0.26 and < −0.26 regardless of adjusted P‐value between controls on standard diet and controls on Atkins diet were used for IPA.  DNA analysis DNA was extracted from the muscle samples using standard phenol–chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and mtDNA copy number was analyzed by qPCR, with primers from the mtDNA gene for 12S rRNA and nuclear gene for amyloid‐beta precursor protein (amyloid‐beta precursor protein (APP)), as previously described (Tyynismaa et al, 2012). mtDNA deletion analysis was done using a quantitative PCR method and the primers described in He et al (2002) with iQ™ Custom SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio‐Rad).",9ec90757-dbbb-4db3-90d6-665c8a5a00aa

Beta‐tubulin antibody (dilution 1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology®, #2128) was used as a loading control, and membranes were imaged using Bio‐Rad ChemiDoc™ XRS+ with Image Lab software.  Metabolomic analysis Plasma was separated immediately after sampling and stored at −140°C. Metabolites were analyzed with ACQUITY UPLC‐MS/MS system (Waters Corporation) as in Khan et al (2014). The column was 2.1 × 100 mm Acquity 1.7um BEH amide HILIC column and the detection system Xevo® TQ‐S tandem triple‐quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation). In order to analyze differences among groups, univariate analysis T‐test2 was performed on autoscaled data.",a2b2cf2e-feb2-48ef-8cb8-d6c16606820e
14,methods10," In order to explain the separation among groups, unsupervised multivariate analysis, principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)), was performed. Non‐transformed data were mean‐centered and autoscaled. Five components were used in all the principal component analysis (PCA) models.

16,results0,"Five adult patients with mitochondrial myopathy followed a high‐fat, low‐carbohydrate “modified Atkins” diet, which resulted in progressive muscle pain and signs of muscle damage in all patients within 2 weeks. This diet especially caused lysis of the ragged‐red fibers (RRFs), the hallmarks of mitochondrial myopathy. Such changes were independent of patient genotype. The changes were accompanied by subtle improvement of muscle strength in a 2.5‐year follow‐up. Healthy subjects did not show such changes.  Clinical impact mAD can induce muscle damage in mitochondrial disease patients. The specific targeting of RRFs indicates a potential to decrease RRF number by short dietary intervention. Evidence suggests that an Atkins diet could provoke muscle damage in a population subgroup, that is, people with subclinical mitochondrial disease.

18,discussion0,"Mitochondria are the cellular hub for nutrient oxidation and contribute also to cellular biosynthetic reactions, linking nutrient intake to cellular energy metabolism and growth (Nikkanen et al, 2016). However, the effects of different diets for mitochondrial disease progression are unexplored. We report here a pilot study enrolling progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) patients and healthy control subjects on a high‐fat, low‐carbohydrate modified Atkins diet. mAD resulted in a uniform response with subacute progressive damage of muscle fibers, especially RRFs, in all of our MM patients, regardless of their genotype or age.",55e66ebe-0701-4679-b009-11074cdad9a9
19,discussion1," The finding is important, as it (i) indicates directly that a diet can modify mitochondrial disease progression; (ii) suggests that a short mAD could decrease RRF number in a wide range of skeletal muscles; and (iii) shows that Atkins diet—a common weight‐loss method—may cause acute muscle damage in a specific population subgroup, raising the question whether an extreme dietary scheme could contribute to manifestation of subclinical MM.  Our patients reached mAD‐induced ketosis similarly as the controls and showed increased serum BCAAs and other alternative energy transducing pathways, indicating partially normal metabolic response to low‐carbohydrate diet of progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) patients. An increase in plasma BCAA levels has been reported as a response to high‐protein diet in a study with human subjects with isocaloric diet design (Chiu et al, 2014).",da2361bc-43b9-435a-a238-f6bc0405eb1c
20,discussion2," However, the subacute degenerative response of RRFs, “selective rhabdomyolysis”, and widespread down‐regulation of the whole mitochondrial oxidative pathway expression indicated that RRFs are especially dependent of carbohydrates and are not able to oxidize ketones, amino acids, or lipids for ATP production. Indeed, MM patients accumulate lipids, especially inside RRFs, which is a typical diagnostic finding for the disease. Our Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data verified a significant accumulation of fat in the patients' muscle and liver. Lipid oxidation is strictly controlled by redox status, especially NADP/NADPH ratio, and reduced availability of NAD+, demonstrated in MM mice (Khan et al, 2014), could underlie the metabolic block.  Iatrogenic induction of muscle degeneration has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy for MM patients carrying primary heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations (Clark et al, 1997).",ce62f988-1142-4c3c-a530-72e48a30cbc3
21,discussion3," The rationale of this idea is based on the finding that muscle satellite cells do not carry mtDNA deletions, and their activation by damage would induce their fusion to existing muscle fibers, replenishing them with wild‐type mtDNA. To purposefully induce muscle damage, previous reports utilized bupivacaine hydrochloride injections to patient muscle (Clark et al, 1997) or strenuous exercise (Taivassalo et al, 1999; Murphy et al, 2008). Our short dietary intervention of 1–1.5 weeks turned out to be an efficient way to stress the metabolism of the whole‐body musculature of MM patients, especially targeting the damage to the most affected RRFs. This raised the question whether such an induction could actually be beneficial by inducing satellite cell fusion. We did not find signs of satellite cell activation in the acute lytic phase, but the improving muscle strength in all patients after 2.",1be933a8-cd96-4225-b55e-1ecc6acd70eb
22,discussion4,"5 years, especially in the youngest patients, suggests that satellite cell induction could occur in the recovery phase.  Our patients with either single or multiple mtDNA deletions, that is, sporadic or secondary mtDNA mutations, responded strikingly uniformly to mAD, both qualitatively and chronologically. The symptom progression, ascending from lower extremities to back muscles, arms, and neck muscles, was similar in all, as was the timing of the lytic response, based on increase of serum CK and myoglobin. The remarkable similarity of the responses despite their different genetic backgrounds suggests a uniform molecular pathophysiology leading to manifestation of MM/progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). Mitochondrial disorders typically manifest with variable phenotypes, even in patients with the same genetic lesion.",ae8e5aed-a793-4318-8ec8-637cf120f346
23,discussion5," Our findings emphasize the importance of phenotypic uniformity of mitochondrial disease patient groups in therapy trials in general—a factor perhaps more important than uniformity of genotypes.  No knowledge of mAD effects in muscle exists, despite it being a popular weight‐loss scheme in the normal population and also used in treatment of severe childhood epilepsies and mitochondrial encephalopathies (for a review, see Sharma & Jain, 2014) (Panetta et al, 2004; Kang et al, 2007; Joshi et al, 2009). These case reports have shown a decreased epileptic attack frequency during ketogenic diet, but the diseases have progressed typically with a fatal course, rendering the results of the true effects inconclusive. Typically, mAD effects on muscle enzymes were not reported, even when used in childhood mitochondrial disease. Our results suggest that CK should be followed up when utilizing high‐fat, low‐carbohydrate diet in treatment of mitochondrial disorders.",d0558cb2-440b-4618-9675-0ea1daae8fac
24,discussion6,"  Our previous study on Deletor mice with MM demonstrated that long‐term high‐fat, low‐carbohydrate diet strongly induced mitochondrial biogenesis and cured the ultrastructural changes of MM (Ahola‐Erkkila et al, 2010). The Deletors mimic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) patients in having COX‐negative, sections were tested for cytochrome c oxidase (COX)/succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)‐positive muscle fibers, although their RRFs do not carry paracrystalline inclusions (Tyynismaa et al, 2005). Therefore, the acute response of our progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) patients in a similar study was unexpected. We here performed a short‐term ketogenic diet for Deletor mice, to ask whether the mice had a similar acute response that had remained undetected. However, no signs of muscle degeneration or CK elevation were found in Deletors.",fbb1288a-c564-44ad-bb21-2044857004da
25,discussion7," These findings indicate that the flexibility of mouse muscle to adapt to different diets is greater than in humans, even when suffering from mitochondrial myopathy. Furthermore, the results emphasize the importance of small pilot trials to follow promising treatment results in mouse models.  mAD has been suggested as a treatment for obesity and T2D (for a review, see Paoli et al, 2013). Our study did not indicate negative side effects in healthy subjects. The transcriptome assay indicted mitochondrial biogenesis induction and boosted oxidative phosphorylation. Control subjects showed a rapid metabolic shift to ketosis, induction of oxidative metabolism in the muscle, and secretion of alternative energy sources in the blood. However, a long‐term significant increase in plasma BCAA levels could be a risk factor for developing insulin resistance and T2D (Newgard et al, 2009; Wang et al, 2011; Newgard, 2012).",fd269941-2ccd-41cf-a36f-1e5e065936ca
26,discussion8," The healthy subjects also showed slightly reduced plasma triglyceride levels, but cholesterol, insulin, or glucose levels remained unchanged. These findings are in agreement with previous reports of low‐carbohydrate diets in human subjects (for a review, see Naude et al, 2014).  In conclusion, our results indicate that nutrition can drastically modify progression of MM and that RRFs are dependent on carbohydrate supply. Furthermore, our results show that mAD may induce muscle cell damage in a small population group with subclinical mitochondrial disease. Based on our results, muscle symptoms and CK values should be closely monitored if low‐carbohydrate diet is used as treatment for mitochondrial disease patient. The uniform response of our progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) patients to mAD indicates existence of a yet‐unknown metabolic block in adult‐onset MM.",f84e0d4b-748e-4312-a9fa-fc75c81af63f
27,discussion9," The exciting potential of dietary intervention as a treatment of MM/progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), aiming to target and reduce the number of RRFs, requires further investigation.  ",39113c82-fd95-41ac-be14-8e0f5855c78d
