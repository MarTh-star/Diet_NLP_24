Patients typically present with developmental delay, seizures, abnormal movements, and delayed myelination. We hereby expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of the disease with the report of the first two Greek siblings that were found compound heterozygous for one known FOLR1 gene mutation (p.Cys65Trp) and a mutation (p.Trp143Arg) that has not yet been reported in the literature (class 3 variant according to ASHG classification). A distinguishing feature of the older sibling is the manifestation of drug‐resistant epileptic spasms beyond infancy. These had a relatively good response to a ketogenic diet, as an additional treatment to topiramate and valproate.",cb32ac62-b66a-435a-9971-15e9369fee7f
1,abstract1," A further clinical improvement was observed when folinic acid was combined with the above treatment. While a response to folinic acid is well established in the disorder, the efficacy of its combination with the ketogenic diet needs further evaluation, but we suggest considering it early in the course of drug resistant epilepsy in the setting of cerebral folate deficiency (CFD). The younger sibling was diagnosed and treated with folinic acid at an early‐symptomatic stage. Both patients had moderately low age‐related CSF 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate levels at diagnosis with the older sibling (that was already treated at base line collection) averaging 19 nmol/L (normal range: 44‐122 nmol/L) and the younger one 49 nmol/L (normal range 63‐122 nmol/L).

JIMD Reports. 2021;60 :3–9. 10.1002/jmd2.12206  Communicating Editor: Brian Fowler ==== Body SYNOPSIS  Ketogenic diet could be considered in cases of drug resistant epilepsy related to cerebral folate deficiency (CFD)‐FOLR1 disorder as an add‐on treatment to antiepileptic medication and/or to folinic acid. Early folinic acid administration represents a disease‐modifying treatment. Lowering of MTHF in CSF is age‐specific and may be mild to moderate, especially in younger patients and at early stages of the disease.",c6021449-1f66-46a6-877a-b4c1b97ffe06
3,abstract3,"  1 INTRODUCTION  Folic acid is a water soluble B‐complex vitamin that is reduced to several metabolites (dihydrofolate, tetrahydrofolate, folinic acid, 10‐formyl‐tetrahydrofolate, 5,10‐methylene‐tetrahydrofolate, 5‐methyl‐tetrahydrofolate, etc) in the human body. All of these play a key role as cofactors or coenzymes in various metabolic processes involving DNA repair, gene expression, amino‐acid/neurotransmitter metabolism, pyrine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and choline formation, that are essential for normal myelination. 1 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate (5‐MTHF) is the main transport folate form, mediated by several transport systems, such as the reduced folate carrier (reduced folate carrier (RFC)) and the proton‐coupled folate transporter (proton‐coupled folate transporter (PCFT)).",5edf4c2d-5e8c-485e-bfa6-86b43f0d343d
4,abstract4," 5‐MTHF also crosses the blood‐CSF‐barrier through binding with the high 5‐MTHF affinity folate receptors a (FRa) of the choroid epithelial cells and serves as the main folate source of the central nervous system. 2 Cerebral folate deficiency (cerebral folate deficiency (CFD)) was first described less than 20 years ago as a neurometabolic condition with low CSF 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate (5‐MTHF) in the setting of normal systemic folate levels. 3 cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) is a potentially reversible condition as symptoms are described to be responsive to folinic acid administration. 4  cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) differential diagnosis includes several primary and secondary conditions that could interfere with transport, metabolism, and recycling of 5‐MTHF in the central nervous system.",7d5d477f-51af-49df-9461-ac804f226741
5,abstract5," 5 Primary conditions include rare inborn errors of folate transport and metabolism, such as deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, dihydrofolate reductase, methenyl‐tetrahydrofolate synthase, and folate receptor alpha. Among the most frequent secondary cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) causes are Kearnes‐Sayre syndrome and other mitochondrial disorders, serine deficiency, pyridoxine‐dependent epilepsy and folate receptor‐a (FRa) antibodies. 1 , 5 Primary causes are related to more severe cerebral folate deficiency (CFD), while mild to moderate cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) has been reported in >30 neurological and genetic conditions, including Rett syndrome, Aicardi‐Goutières syndrome, CNS hypoxia, epileptic syndromes, but also antiepileptic and other drug administration. 6  2 CASE PRESENTATION  A 19 months old female patient was referred to our department because of developmental delay, hypotonia and mild ataxia.",ec6e4703-5c4f-4c9e-b1bd-2b4c5161159b

No acute adverse effects were reported during IV administration but mild leucopenia (~3.500‐4.500 leukocytes, neutrophils 900‐1100) was probably linked to the treatment, after a negative extended etiological work‐up.

15,discussion0,"  Mutations in the FOLR1 gene (OMIM #613068) encoding for the folate alpha receptor represent a rare cause of cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) with only 23 cases described to date. 5 This autosomal recessive disorder was first described by Steinfeld et al 8 in 2009, who reported two German siblings with compound heterozygosity for two nonsense mutations and one Italian patient with a homozygous duplication in FOLR1. Impaired transcription and severely diminished FRa expression was biochemically proven for all three patients that shared clinical and neuroimaging features; all three showed some improvement under per os folinic acid administration. 8  We report the first two siblings in Greece with compound heterozygous missense mutations in FOLR1, inherited from their healthy, nonconsanguineous, parents of Greek origin. The paternal mutation c.195C > G (p. Cys65Trp) had previously been described in a homozygous Azerbaijani patient, 9 but the maternal missense c.427 T > A (p.",2854cd12-2112-4b31-97a6-2b1db4364beb
16,discussion1,"Trp143Arg) mutation is novel. According to the ASHG classification 10 the c.427 T > A (p.Trp143Arg) variant has been interpreted as a class 3 variant, a variant of uncertain significance; it should thus be interpreted with caution. However, its pathogenicity is supported by the in silico predictive tools, the phenotype, the low age‐related 5‐MTHF levels in patients' CSF, the compound heterozygosity and the cosegregation in the family. The FOLR1 gene has been sequenced as part of WES in full (100% coverage for this gene) in all involved individuals and no further mutation has been identified. In addition, this variant is not present in international databases (ClinVar, HGMD, 1000GP, etc).  Grapp et al further studied the effect of p.Cys65Trp mutation and other homozygous or compound heterozygous missense mutations in FOLR1 of 7 patients.",358f4ced-b113-4946-a15d-e298203ab31f
17,discussion2," They report that the impairment in folate binding was due to loss of FRa cell surface localization and mistargeting to intracellular compartments, even in cases of a very small decrease in protein expression. 9 The spectrum of FRa deficiency is still expanding but patients described so far have some common clinical and neuroimaging features. 11 A symptom‐free period that ranges from 4 months to 4.5 years is probably linked to the intrauterine expression of folate receptor beta (FRβ) that assures brain folate transport during early life. 12 Symptoms are initially motor anomalies (hypotonia, tremor, ataxia, etc) and speech delay with subsequent developmental regression and seizures. Other clinical features include irritability, spasticity, autistic behavior, acquired (only 1 patient with congenital) microcephaly and polyneuropathy.",f979b706-ed11-4b0a-97d9-e17320eac767
18,discussion3,"5, 9  Seizure onset is usually after 18 months of age and several seizure types including astatic, tonic, tonic‐clonic and atypical absences have been described, along with recurrent episodes of status epilepticus. 5 Epilepsy onset with epileptic spasms and hypsarrhythmic‐like pattern is a distinguishing feature of the older sister. This unique clinical presentation, led to the induction of a ketogenic diet. Data on EEG ictal and interictal activity is very limited (slow background activity, multifocal discharges, etc) in existing literature, followed by a lot of uncertainties on whether any drug other than folinic acid is efficient on FRa related seizures. 13 Ketogenic diet as an add‐on treatment was beneficial for the drug resistant epilepsy of the older sibling, with approximately 50% of seizure reduction, possibly linked to its established benefit in mitochondrial function.",47b69e5b-df6c-42b6-8a36-d1e2c9dd84fa
19,discussion4," Further significant clinical improvement was achieved after a combination of per os and IV calcium folinate was added to the treatment (Supplementary file 1).  Disturbed myelination becomes apparent early in the course of the disease; other usual neuroimaging findings include cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, T2 hyperintensities and low choline/inositol metabolites in MR spectroscopy. 5 , 9 Severe delay in myelination was apparent even in the younger, affected brother, just after the appearance of mild symptoms. On the other hand, none of the siblings presented brain atrophy. Although there is evidence that brain atrophy progresses with time in untreated patients, 13 further investigations are needed to correlate this feature to either early diagnosis and treatment or interindividual differences.  Surprisingly, the untreated younger brother at the age of 12 months had relatively high‐for‐age 5‐MTHF CSF levels in comparison to the levels of his sister at the age of 32 months.",eb743051-892e-45a9-9977-50247c8daaf3
20,discussion5," The CSF collection and analysis were identical between siblings; the older sister was under treatment with per os calcium folinate at diagnosis. 5‐MTHF levels of younger sibling were also higher compared to previous patients with FOLR1 deficiency (usually <5 nmol/L). Differences in analytical methods across countries/groups are largely eliminated by compliance to internationally standardized procedures.  Previous reports have proven gradual diminution of 5‐MTHF levels in untreated patients with cerebral folate deficiency (CFD). 3 , 14 Measurement of plasma and CSF 5‐MTHF levels in a cohort of 538 patients illustrated, that profound MTHF deficiency in CSF is more likely associated with monogenic disorders such as FOLR1 deficiency, while mild to moderate cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) in infancy may be associated with a variety of neurological conditions and may represent a secondary phenomenon.",3004b771-c03b-447f-9aba-844c96c2a930
21,discussion6," 14 The moderate decrease of CSF 5‐MTHF of the siblings in our report indicates that the absolute levels of CSF 5‐MTHF per se do not allow discrimination between genetic defects primarily affecting folate metabolism and secondary cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) related to other CNS diseases, especially when the CSF collection is performed at young age and/or an early symptomatic state.  In fact, a clear correlation between genetic‐clinical‐neuroimaging and biochemical findings in FOLR1 deficiency has not been established and management can be very challenging. Several different regimens of folinic acid supplementation have been proposed. When oral supplementation with 2‐10 mg/kg of folinic acid is not sufficient to achieve clinical improvement, additional intravenous injections of folinic acid weekly may be necessary (we used an adjusted‐upon‐response regimen of IV ~10 mg/kg calcium folinate twice weekly).",60bb0090-9db9-4081-88c1-d8fb9b3b4aaf
22,discussion7," Other experts also propose IV 50‐100 mg folinic acid once per week and intrathecal administration of folinic acid in selected patients. 15 Response to folinic acid administration varies significantly between individuals, but folinic acid has been proven beneficial even in adult patients. 16 The benefit of folinic acid supplementation reported in the case of the older sibling is difficult to be interpreted, as it was administered in combination with ketogenic diet and antiepileptic treatment. Several challenges arise with regards to administration type/dosage/folate form/adverse effects of treatment. Early diagnosis and folinic acid administration remains the management gold standard that can possibly alter the course of the disease, as suggested by familial cases with early and late treatment initiation.
