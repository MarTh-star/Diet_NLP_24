0,background0,"Obesity is characterised by excessive fat accumulation, and it is well established that the percentage of the population that is either obese or overweight is rising over time [1]. Obesity is also associated with several health issues, including the development of metabolic syndrome, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and various cancers [2]. The causes of obesity are not simply the consumption of a greater amount of energy than is utilised; instead, obesity is a complex disorder, with many biological, psychological, and sociological factors combining in its development [3].  A considerable number of health interventions have been trialled to reduce obesity [2]. In terms of dietary interventions, the efficacy of these trials is mixed, with a sizeable proportion of dieters regaining more weight than they initially lose [4].",2f41120a-4d8e-4744-8f58-6c5a075b860f
1,background1," Emerging research suggests that the ability to place obese subjects on a personalised nutrition regime using genetic information may increase both adherence to that diet and subsequent post-diet nutrition, enhancing health outcomes [5–8]. This has been demonstrated in recent years in studies on gene-diet interactions and the emergence of nutrigenetics, a goal of which is to add a level of personalization to standard nutrition by adjusting it according to genetic variation. Prior studies suggest that specific genetic variants may increase susceptibility to certain disease states, but that this increased risk can be reduced or completely mitigated with dietary modification [9–12]. As an example, variation in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotype leads to alterations in plasma folate status [13], which can increase the risk of hyperhomocysteinemia, potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease [14].",7dbdc39e-48bb-452c-9e22-802dc55057c3
2,background2," However, in those with the risk (TT) genotype, intakes of greater than the recommended daily allowance (recommended daily allowance (RDA)) of folate are associated with a lowering of homocysteine to reference values [9]. This indicates that a “one-size fits all” approach to nutrition is perhaps insufficient, and that individualised nutrient guidelines may improve population health.  Whilst obesity itself increases all-cause mortality [15], it is also associated with other issues that may negatively affect health, including elevated total cholesterol (TC) [16], lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL)) [17] and raised fasting blood glucose (fasting blood glucose (FBG)) [18]. Management of these markers is important in optimising individual health and reducing mortality risk.",ec5fe803-54b3-42af-8409-f5ac80383303
3,background3,"  A key observation, made by many, is the unsurprising conclusion that hypocaloric dietary adherence, regardless of the diet macronutrient composition, is the most critical aspect of weight loss success [19–21]. Furthermore, ongoing adherence to healthy nutrition after the initial caloric restriction phase is equally critical to achieving long-term weight loss. A weight management study by Arkadianos et al. [5] utilised a nutrigenetic test which was not specifically targeted at weight loss. Participants were allocated into either a nutrigenetic or control group, similar in calories and macronutrient composition. Within the nutrigenetic group, diet was modified by the addition of certain micronutrients based on the genetic results, and small changes in macronutrients (e.g. a reduction in refined carbohydrate from a maximum of 10% calories to max 8% calories; reduction of glycaemic load (GL) (from a maximum of 100 to 70). Adherence was determined by clinic visits and questionnaires.",abf7ac53-35b8-42f1-81fb-ea9288c8d7e2
4,background4," Weight loss during the 24-week diet was similar in both groups, but during follow-up over a 1-year period, the nutrigenetic group maintained weight loss while the non-genetic group regained weight [5].  The aim of the present study was to observe weight loss 2-stage process: A 24-week dietary intervention comparing two diets: The well-known, and generally the most effective in the short-term ketogenic diet [22] vs. A lowGI/Nutrigenetic diet.  A second phase, lasting 18 months, utilising standard guidelines for the ketogenic group vs standard guidelines modified by nutrigenetic advice for the lowGI/NG group.    The study protocol was similar to Arkadianos et al. [5] and used a nutrigenetic test which had been further developed in the European Union (EU) funded consortium project EUROGENE [23].",9d97cdc4-edb6-49be-931c-6cdd0f53f46b
5,background5," The addition of nutrigenetic advice was not designed nor proposed to patients as a weight loss diet, nor to predict either disease risk or obesity risk; the aim was to optimize the nutrient content of an individual’s daily food intake, based on current understanding of an individual’s genetic profile. Whilst an individual is achieving weight loss, food consumption is generally reduced and some nutrients in the diet may not be in adequate supply; nutrigenetics may be a tool to help achieve optimum nutrient content on an individual basis. Furthermore, the use of nutrigenetics in designing personalized diet and lifestyle programs has the potential to increase motivation and compliance with long-term lifestyle changes.  The primary objective was measurement of weight loss in the two groups after the 24-week diet and at 18-months of follow up.",e6b83dec-3338-4385-8a8a-0700921e793b

7,methods0,"One hundred fourteen subjects (1 overweight; 113 obese) subjects (M = 55, F = 59, age 24-56y, all of Romanian heritage and similar socio-economic status), who were patients at a weight management clinic (Bucharest, Romania), gave written informed consent for their weight loss data to be prospectively analysed for this study. All patient data were handled according to the Romanian Code of Medical Deontology and in accordance with the Helsinki Agreement. Approval was given by the Ethics Committee of the University and Pharmacy, Cluj Napoca, Romania (registration number 444). Upon enrolment at the weight management clinic, the subjects self-selected either a ketogenic diet or a low-GI nutrigenetic diet. A ketogenic diet was utilised as the comparison diet due to its reported efficacy in the treatment of obesity [24]. Fifty-three subjects (25 female; age 43.0 ± 7.2y) selected the ketogenic diet plan, and 61 subjects (34 female; age 42.0 ± 6.7y) selected the low-GI nutrigenetic diet plan.",0445d466-6c41-4228-9007-0bceb36bb363

10,methods5," Here, the ketogenic group followed population based nutrition and exercise guidelines, whilst the low-GI nutrigenetic group followed population based guidelines, slightly modified based on the genetic results of each patient. Other than the modifications to the standard diet and exercise program, the patients in both groups were treated in an identical manner.  Ketogenic diet The ketogenic diet group were instructed to consume ≤35 g of carbohydrates per day, and ≤ 10% of total calories were from saturated fats. Daily protein intake was set at 1.2 g/kg bodyweight for females, and 1.5 g/kg bodyweight for males. A sample day’s menu is available in the supplementary materials (S1).  Low-GI Nutrigenetic diet The low-GI nutrigenetic diet group had individualised dietary instructions based on their genetic results; examples of the advice given are found in Table 2.",9a3b6bfb-62e7-40a0-9001-9d63fc99a802
11,methods6," The gene variants were selected based on previous evidence of gene-diet interactions, in which a nutrition or exercise intervention was demonstrated to modify the effect of the variation, and which fulfilled the criteria described in [54]. The genetic results of each individual were then analysed for sensitivity to carbohydrates (utilising SNPs in ACE, PPARG, TCF7L2, ADRB2 and FABP2) and saturated fats (ADRB2, ADRB3, APOA2, FABP2, FTO, PPARG). A score for both carbohydrate and saturated fat sensitivity was determined by utilising a point system, with the aggregate result being utilised. The base diet for each person was similar and was modified by refined carbohydrate content (maximum 10, 8%, or 6% total calories) and saturated fat content (maximum 10, 8%, or 6% total calories) according to the relevant sensitivity scores.

12,methods7," All subjects were advised to focus on whole-grain complex carbohydrates, as well as fruits and vegetables, as their primary sources of carbohydrates. Subject diets were also modified for some micronutrients and other macronutrients where the evidence is sufficient to deviate from the standard guidelines [54]. For example, individuals with a deletion allele for either GSTM1 or GSTT1 were recommended to increase their cruciferous vegetable intake [39], whilst those with a C allele for CYP1A2 were recommended to limit their caffeine intake to < 200 mg/d [10].",4e6edc1e-b432-475a-88e9-f426869b8638

In both groups the exercise protocol for each person was carefully planned to avoid over-exertion in this overweight and generally sedentary cohort. The low-GI nutrigenetic group were given additional exercise advice, based on their results of six SNPs; ACE, ADRB2, ADRB3, FTO, PPARG and TCF7L2. As per the diet scoring, the results of each of these SNPs was combined, to give subjects guidance as to the volume of high, medium or low-intensity exercise recommended, total exercise duration was matched between the groups.

Detailed diaries were maintained throughout the 24-week period, including the weighing of foods. All subjects received a menu plan with recipes. In addition, in the ketogenetic group, patients were taught how to test ketosis using Ketostix® (Ascensia Diabetes Care Holdings AG, Basel, Switzerland), measuring ketone bodies in the urine, which they did daily. Ketostix strips determine the presence of AA (acetoacetate). The end of the strip is passed through the urine stream and the colour then compared to the colour chart provided with the product.

After re-adjusting the diet, these patients regained their ketosis state. Within the first year of follow up, 17 patients in the ketogenic group reported having deviated at least 3 times a month from the nutrition plan, consuming foods other than those prescribed. In the second year of follow-up, 24 patients were found to have diverged frequently from the nutrition plan due to special family events, social events, holidays, prolonged weekends and in some cases lack of motivation.",868d1d91-a1eb-458b-a2bb-0cddea26a09a

25,discussion0,"The main findings of this study are (1) after 6 months diet the ketogenic group lost more weight compared to the LowGI/nutrigenetic group (26.2 kg vs 23.5 kg; p = 0.0061) (2). After 18-month follow-up the ketogenic group had regained some of the weight lost but the LowGI/nutrigenetics group continued to lose weight, at a slower rate (19.4 kg vs 27.5 kg; p < 0.0001). The LowGI/nutrigenetic group, after 18-month follow-up, also reported better results for total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and glucose. Also, though a few individuals of the LowGI/nutrigenetic group had regained some weight at 18-month follow-up (Fig. 1) all 61 were below the pre-diabetes blood glucose level of 100 mg/dl while only 16 of 53 of the keto group were below that level (Fig. 2).  These results mirror previous those of previous studies, such as those by Arkadianos et al. [5].",104be5be-3097-4324-a0de-de8486c799a7
26,discussion1," In the current study, these differences became more apparent over time; during the 18-month post-diet timeframe, particularly regarding changes in body weight. Indeed, up to the 24-week time point, there were significant differences between the diet groups in terms of body weight change and biomarker improvement in favour of the ketogenic group.  Long term maintenance of weight loss requires permanent lifestyle changes in exercise and eating habits. These changes need to be significant but not necessarily radical or unachievable if planned over several years of gradual but sustainable weight loss. Nutrigenetic modifications, as part of personalized nutrition (PN) add a small part to the overall diet, with an obvious question being whether it improves adherence to healthy nutrition. Nutrigenetics includes advice dependent on genetic results and following the straight-forward gene-diet advice the aim is that the overall eating pattern will improve.",c8fe3f0f-df97-4bb6-bc00-711c4867b355
27,discussion2," Nutrigenetic PN does not create complex personalized diets, merely slight differences between diet types.  One possibility for this enhanced long-term weight loss, combined with improvements in markers of metabolic health, is that healthy eating compliance is greater when nutrigenetics is used to modify the standard nutrition guidelines at the end of the dieting phase. The dietary adherence data in this study agrees with this possibility, as does previous research in personalized nutrition. Nielsen and El-Sohemy [57] reported that participants tend to find genetically tailored nutritional advice useful. A subsequent study by the same authors [8] reported that personalized dietary advice based on a person’s genetic makeup improves eating habits compared to current ‘one-size-fits-all’ dietary recommendations.",9fd0799c-79ae-47f8-9e49-b5ca24798adf
28,discussion3," The authors reported that subjects who received DNA-based dietary advice started to show improvements to their diets after 3 months, with the changes becoming more apparent after 12 months. A recent randomised controlled trial of nutrigenomics-guided lifestyle intervention reported “Weight management interventions guided by nutrigenomics can motivate long-term improvements in dietary fat intake above and beyond gold-standard population-based interventions.” [6].  Some studies exploring the genetic risk of common diseases have found varying results, with some reporting that knowledge of genetic risk score has little impact on behaviour [58]. Key differences with personalized nutrigenetics studies, compared to genetic risk studies, include that (a) genetic information is linked only to nutrient/lifestyles requirements and is not explicitly linked to disease risk and (b) the information given to individuals includes precise advice on increasing or decreasing specific food groups.",c879a5b2-1384-462d-a46b-00965dd05885
29,discussion4," Thus, adherence to a dietary/lifestyle intervention appears to be more successful in nutrigenetics compared to a genetic disease risk score, which often do not come with personalised nutrition guidelines to mitigate any increased risk. As a result, there is increasing evidence that one of the main benefits with nutrition and genetics is that of behavioural change [59].  It is important to note some potential limitations to this current study. The mechanisms underpinning the enhanced weight loss and health improvements in the low-GI nutrigenetic group are unclear; it may be potentially due to dietary adherence, or specific biological mechanisms, which were not tested. It is also possible that the effects were placebo or expectancy mediated in nature. Additionally, the lead study author was not blinded to the results of each individual’s genotype results, which may have affected the study outcome.",6824762a-80b4-4226-99c3-502be2d2b553
30,discussion5,"  Another limitation is that in this study the associations observed with the low GI/nutrigenetic diet were only in comparison to a ketogenic diet, it would have been ideal to have other groups including lowGI only, without nutrigenetics – but that wasn’t feasible with the resources available and we had showed previously that a lowGI/nutrigenetics diet gave better long-term results to lowGI only [5].  The choice of a ketogenic diet as the control diet has the potential to alter the results; a ketogenic diet can be difficult to adhere to for certain individuals [60]. A ketogenic diet may also disturb basal metabolic processes leading to adverse reactions when returning to standard nutrition. Additionally, fasting blood glucose was significantly lower at baseline in the low-GI nutrigenetic group when compared to the ketogenic diet.",c110cec4-d354-45ce-b4c5-ab4389b39fec
31,discussion6," The low-GI nutrigenetic group lowered their fasting blood glucose to a greater extent in this study, and the baseline differences may have contributed to this variation between groups. It is not clear why these baseline differences were present, but they overlapped.  An additional limitation is that the population used in this study were almost exclusively obese; it is not clear whether such a lifestyle modification would be effective in non-obese, but overweight, individuals – although other studies demonstrated an improved healthy-eating index in such people [61]. However, despite these issues, the study addressed an important unmet need to generate real world data; a common issue with clinical trials is that participant behaviour may be altered simply by being part of a study [62]. It has been increasingly recognized that such data in real world settings is needed to improve health outcomes [63].",412d325e-ec1f-46d5-bb4f-44b6587bdefe
32,discussion7," Thus, we believe that the present study does accurately represent the real-world, in which high-risk individuals were given a dietary intervention in order to improve health. Study subjects were European Caucasians; ethnicity is a known potential modifier of gene-diet interactions, so it’s not clear whether the findings of this study would hold true for other populations, although the majority of the variants utilised here are functional—i.e. they directly affect the protein—and so their effect should be the similar regardless of ethnicity. Further research in this area should examine the use of a low-GI nutrigenetic personalized nutrition to reduce the risk of developing obesity or metabolic syndromes in healthy, non-obese subjects, as well as replicating the results of this study in populations of non-European ethnicity. Finally, this study utilised a low-GI, nutrigenetic diet, and compared the outcomes of this diet to a ketogenic diet.",37820793-f0e1-486a-9ce2-3c18d4f4aca5
33,discussion8," As the ketogenic diet group did not undergo genetic testing, and have their nutritional intervention tailored to their genetic results, a next study should look at the addition of nutrigenetic advice after the 24-week ketogenic diet, to see if the benefits of the ketogenic diet are maintained in the long term, especially as after the 24-week diet and benefits were mostly greater in the ketogenic group.  Conclusions The results of this study suggest that a 24-week, ketogenic diet was superior to a low-GI nutrigenetic diet at improving weight loss and health markers compared to baseline upon completion of the dietary intervention, but at 18-month follow up the low-GI nutrigenetic group fared better.",42e49f99-e807-4845-af4f-bb3b3d8394d7
34,discussion9," These findings suggest that despite the better results in the ketogenic group following a 24-week dietary intervention, over longer periods the low-GI nutrigenetic diet may be useful in the treatment of both obesity and altered blood markers of metabolic health, and that these benefits appear to be maintained following the completion of a dietary intervention, an effective aid in long term lifestyle changes leading to sustained weight loss and health improvements.
