0,methods0," 2.1. Subjects  A total of 20 young (5 months) and 13 aged (21 months) male Fisher 344 x Brown Norway hybrid F1 rats were used in this study. Rats were split across 3 diet groups: one group (ad lib; 6 young and 4 aged) was given ad libitum access to standard rodent chow (18% fat, 24% protein, 58% carbohydrate; Envigo, Teklad 2918), a second group (time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto; 7 young and 4 aged) was given a ketogenic diet (75.85% fat, 20.12% protein, 3.85% carbohydrate; Lab Supply; 5722, Fort Worth, TX, USA; see [3,41] for additional diet details) fed to them once daily (time-restricted feeding; time restricted feeding (TRF)) and the third group (time restricted feeding (TRF) Control; 7 young and 5 aged) was given a diet similar in macronutrient ratio to the control diet, but also fed to them once daily (16.35% fat, 18.76% protein, 64.89% carbohydrate; Lab Supply; 1810727, Fort Worth, TX, USA; see [3,41] for additional diet details).",142f3352-83c9-46a5-8a26-75aad870b011
1,methods1," Rats in both time restricted feeding (TRF) groups were fed approximately 7 h after the onset of their dark (active) phase, which may be considered comparable to late-time restricted feeding (TRF) [42]. Each group remained on their respective diets for 7 months (28 weeks).  2.2. Tissue Collection  At the time of euthanasia, rats were placed in a bell jar containing isoflurane-saturated cotton (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA) until righting reflex was lost. Rats were immediately decapitated and tissue was immediately extracted. Trunk blood was collected, allowed to sit at room temperature for at least 20 min and then spun at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C until use. Fecal samples were collected directly from the distal colon, placed in Para-Pak (Meridian Bioscience Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA) and immediately stored at −80 °C until use.  2.3.",dd3e23bf-ce0c-4f7f-be33-781606585178
2,methods2," Nutritional Ketosis  Nutritional ketosis was determined via circulating glucose (mg/dL) and ketone body (β-hydroxybutyrate; BHB; mmol/L)) concentration using the Precision Xtra blood monitoring system (Abbott Diabetes Care, Inc, Alameda, CA, USA). These values were utilized to calculate a glucose ketone index (glucose ketone index (GKI)), in which lower values indicate a higher level of nutritional ketosis, using the formula: glucose (mgdL)18.016BHB (mmolL).  2.4. Cytokine Analysis  Circulating concentration of the cytokines TNFα, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukins (ILs) 4, 6 and 10 were quantified from blood samples utilizing a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD; Rockville, MD, USA) Rat Proinflammatory Panel 2 and a Quick Plex SQ 120 imager (MSD, Rockville, MD) using electrochemiluminescence technology.  2.5. Fecal Microbiome Taxonomy  Analysis of fecal microbiome was performed via 16S rRNA gene sequencing as previously described [43,44].",6632b463-3359-4a12-a083-bb7046d50ab7
3,methods3," Briefly, a Zymo Research Fecal DNA isolation kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA; catalog # D6010) was used for DNA isolation. Isolated DNA was then quantitated and barcoded via polymerase chain reaction (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) amplification of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene [45] using degenerate primers with slight modifications as described [46] from the original Capaoraso primer sequences [47]. As previously described [46,48], polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were resolved on agarose gels; DNA was isolated and purified using Qiagen kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany); and then quantitated. The products were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), a single-flow cell, single-lane instrument.",469fe69f-df33-4995-9a9b-039239a352f9
4,methods4,"  Following quality control, exact amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were resolved and taxonomy was assigned using the SILVA small subunit ribosomal RNA database version 132 (Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology and Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany) [49]. Alpha diversity, or the diversity within samples, was quantified for age, diet group and feeding paradigm utilizing the microbiome package in R [50] with the following measures: Richness was evaluated utilizing the Chao1 index [51], which estimates the number or species in a community. Diversity was evaluated using the inverse Simpson index, which measures the dominances of a multispecies community [52]. Evenness was then determined utilizing Simpson’s index, which accounts for the number of species present as well as relative abundance of each of those species. Dominance was also found using Shannon’s index, as the dominance index gives the abundance of the most abundant species transformation [53].",7472a15f-d19a-4b27-8bf7-5f264faa1738
5,methods5," The rarity index characterizes the concentration of species at low abundance, using the skewness of the frequency distribution of arithmetic abundance classes [54] and using the log-modulo transformation [53]. Beta diversity was determined via permutational multivariate analysis of variance (permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)) on Bray–Curtis, weighted Unifrac [55], and unweighted Unifrac distance matrices using the Phyloseq package [56] in R [57]. Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes (Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes (ANCOM)) with Bias Correction was used to test for differential abundance at several levels across diet and feeding paradigm treatment groups using modified versions of previously published Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes (ANCOM) scripts [58,59]. Briefly, raw counts were filtered for any sequence present in at least 30% of all samples.",6ca8cddc-4d9c-42c8-9902-24a0b09348f2
6,methods6," The Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes (ANCOM) detection limit was set to the default value of 0.7 and was run on centered log ratio transformed (centered log ratio transformed (CLR)) count data using a Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected significance level of 0.05 and adjusting for cohort grouping as a covariant.  2.6. Metagenomics  Metagenome libraries were generated by using the Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) on 4 aged samples per diet group. Quality control was performed using the MG-RAST v4.0.3 pipeline quality control filter [60], which resulted in an average of 24,425,398 reads to be included in further analysis. Of those, ~55% of the proteins were annotated to an assigned function or specific gene by the MG-RAST v4.0.3 pipeline.  2.7. Statistical Analysis  Cytokine, glucose ketone index (GKI), and alpha diversity data were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs, with the between-subjects factors of age and diet.",e7c24340-4661-4c17-acc4-4f47fd5c8ce0
7,methods7," Post hoc analyses were conducted via Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, when appropriate. T-tests were utilized for post hoc analyses when statistically indicated via main effect of any between-subjects variable. See microbiome and metagenomics methods above for related statistical analysis. All analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism v9.2.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA USA), R v4.1.1, or IBM SPSS v25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical significance was considered at p values less than 0.05, unless the Benjamini–Hochberg method [61] of correcting for false discovery rate was applied as stated within the text.  3. Results  3.1. Confirmation of Nutritional Ketosis  At the time of euthanasia, circulating glucose and ketone body levels were quantified to calculate a glucose ketone index (glucose ketone index (GKI)), in which lower values indicate a higher level of nutritional ketosis (Figure 1). While there were no effects of age on glucose ketone index (GKI) (F(1,27) = 0.",29ba4398-36b0-4bb4-bce5-893697ca2a08
8,methods8,"66; p = 0.42), there was a significant effect of diet (F(2,27) = 44.24; p < 0.0001), as both the ad libitum (T(27) = 7.12; p < 0.0001), and time restricted feeding (TRF) Control-fed (T(27) = 8.92; p < 0.0001) rats had significantly higher glucose ketone index (GKI) levels than time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto-fed rats. Ad libitum and time restricted feeding (TRF) Control-fed rats did not have significantly different glucose ketone index (GKI) levels (T(27) = 1.43; p = 0.42).  3.2. Cytokine Analysis  Circulating cytokine concentrations were quantified in serum collected at the time of sacrifice. For all five cytokines assessed, there were no significant effects of age, though there was a strong trend for an increase with age in TNFα (F(1,27) = 4.05, p = 0.05; p > 0.24 for all others). Moreover, there were no effects of diet on any of the cytokines aside from TNFα (F(2,27) = 3.63, p = 0.04; p > 0.40 for all others).",2ada8ef1-ffac-4ee7-b7db-6219e624cc09
9,methods9," Post hoc analysis for TNFα revealed that while aged rats fed ad libitum had significantly higher cytokine levels than young rats (t(29) = 2.52, p = 0.03), this was not the case for time restricted feeding (TRF)-fed rats (t(29) = 0.69, p > 0.99) regardless of macronutrient profile. There were no significant interactions between age and diet for any cytokines (p > 0.26 for all comparisons).  3.3. 16S Microbiome Analysis  3.3.1. Diversity  Alpha diversity was calculated through several common measures, as described above. The results of two-way ANOVAs with the between-subjects factors of age and diet group, with post hoc assessment of age within each diet group are displayed in Table 1. Moreover, this table also includes the results of two-way ANOVAs with the between-subjects factors of age and feeding paradigm (with both time restricted feeding (TRF) groups combined), with post hoc assessment of feeding paradigm within each age group.",ee77c52e-76c6-4021-883f-f81dae6e267b
10,methods10," The Inverse Simpson measure of diversity was the only measure indicating significant differences across feeding paradigm (F(1,29) = 26.28; p < 0.0001; Figure 2).  Beta diversity was calculated using the Bray–Curtis (BC) Dissimilarity, unweighted Unifrac (unweighted Unifrac (UWU)) and weighted Unifrac (WU) analyses (Figure 3). For each of these methods, a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) comparing all three diet groups indicated a significant effect of diet (BC: F(2,30) = 5.94; p = 0.001; unweighted Unifrac (UWU): F(2,30) = 4.96; p = 0.001; WU: F(2,30) = 8.24; p = 0.001). Similarly, a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) comparing the ad libitum to time restricted feeding (TRF) feeding paradigms also revealed a significant effect of feeding paradigm on beta diversity (BC: F(1,31) = 5.23; p = 0.001; unweighted Unifrac (UWU)F(1,31) = 5.53; p = 0.001; WU: F(1,31) = 5.55; p = 0.001).  3.3.2.",1025a023-f670-48e0-ae9b-3e56db5ca4c7
11,methods11," Differential Abundance  Analysis of composition of microbiomes (Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes (ANCOM)) was utilized to examine taxa that had statistically different abundance between dietary (Figure 4A) and feeding paradigm groups (Figure 4B), each adjusted for age. At the phylum level, five phyla (Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Deferribacteres, Patscibacteria and Verrucomicrobia) are significantly influenced by diet (Figure 4C) and three phyla (Actinobacteria, Patscibacteria and Verrucomicrobia) are significantly influenced by feeding paradigm (Figure 4D).  Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes (ANCOM) was also repeated at the genus level, which demonstrated that 22 genera were significantly altered by diet group, and 9 genera were significantly altered by feeding paradigm (Figure 5). Interestingly, all genera significantly affected by feeding paradigm were also significantly altered by diet group.",11882fae-26a1-49ff-b690-25bcb70ea891
12,methods12," The difference in centered log ratio (centered log ratio transformed (CLR))-transformed counts utilized in the Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes (ANCOM) analysis between each time restricted feeding (TRF) group and the ad libitum group were plotted against the W statistic, which represents the number of times the ratio between the given taxon and each of the other taxa in the community was significantly different between the two treatment groups (Figure 5B,C).  3.3.3. Metagenomics  In addition to taxonomical differences, metagenomic analyses were used to identify functional differences (Figure 6). Community-wide functional representation was assessed by mapping metagenomic reads to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)) Orthology (KO) database via MG-RAST. Within each level 2 subgroup, level 3 groupings were investigated via two-way ANOVA with diet group and level 3 classification as between-subjects factors.",8877a6be-dd4c-4f4d-a22e-0c7968bbb776
13,methods13," Based on our a priori hypothesis that metagenomic data would significantly differ based on feeding paradigm regardless of macronutrient composition, post hoc analysis was performed for each time restricted feeding (TRF) diet group relative to ad libitum rats using Dunnett’s Multiple Comparisons. Significant differences at level 3 were then further investigated at the functional level in pertinent pathways.  Several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways involved in metabolic processes were altered by both dietary interventions. Firstly, within the carbohydrate metabolism level, components of the tricarboxylic acid (tricarboxylic acid (TCA)) cycle were significantly upregulated by time restricted feeding (TRF) relative to ad libitum, including citrate synthase (CS), pyruvate carboxylase subunit B (pycB), 2-oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase subunits alpha and beta (korA and korB), and malate dehydrogenase (mdh).",3c6f69f7-7f01-4711-b836-dcf03f986e35
14,methods14," Secondly, amino acid metabolic pathways were also altered by time restricted feeding (TRF), including glycine, serine and threonine metabolism and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. Within alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, several pathways were specifically upregulated by time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto, but not time restricted feeding (TRF) Control, including asparagine synthase (asnB), carbamoyl-phosphate synthase large subunit (carB), glutamate dehydrogenase (NADP+; gdhA), amidophosphoribosyltransferase (purF) and glutamate synthase (NADPH/NADH) large and small chains (gltB and gltD). Only one pathway was significantly upregulated by time restricted feeding (TRF) Control but not time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto, alanine dehydrogenase (ald).",cc5ae67a-c5dd-49ba-a1e4-0ba370d13f9f
15,methods15," Within the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism level, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD)), glycine dehydrogenase (glycine dehydrogenase (GLDC)) and glycine C-acetyltransferase (Gcatalase (CAT)) were all upregulated by both time restricted feeding (TRF) diets. However, ilvA, tdcB; threonine dehydratase (ilvA), 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM)), tryptophan synthase beta chain (trpB) and phosphoserine aminotransferase (serC) were significantly upregulated by time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto alone. Moreover, aminomethyltransferase (gcvT) and bifunctional aspartokinase/homoserine dehydrogenase 1 (thrA) associated pathways were significantly upregulated by time restricted feeding (TRF) Control alone and glycine hydroxymethyltransferase (glyA) was significantly downregulated by time restricted feeding (TRF) Control alone.",b2c80587-0207-4890-b71e-43542d5bfa70
16,methods16," Thirdly, within the energy metabolism level, oxidative phosphorylation was significantly upregulated by the time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto, but not time restricted feeding (TRF) Control, demonstrating that not all effects are due to feeding paradigm alone.  Relatedly, within the environmental information processing level, signal transduction along the PI3K–Akt pathway was significantly upregulated by time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto, but not time restricted feeding (TRF) Control. This pathway is vital to cellular and organismal function, as it is involved in cell proliferation and survival by phosphorylating (and thereby modulating) a variety of substrates. This includes, but is not limited to, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), GLUT4 (resulting in translocation to the membrane), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, P21/Waf1/Cip1 and P27/Kip2 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [62].",63c7efbd-8d12-47d0-9942-f48e30ff5ebc
17,methods17," Conversely, several neuroactive ligand–receptor interactions were significantly downregulated in both time restricted feeding (TRF)-fed diets relative to ad libitum. Both time restricted feeding (TRF) diets significantly downregulated several receptors and receptor subunits, including formyl peptide receptor-like (formyl peptide receptor like (FPRL)), gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit epsilon (gamma aminobutyric acid receptor subunit epsilon (GABRE)), metabotropic glutamate receptor 6/7/8 (GRM_6_7_8), 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1 (HTR1), trypsin (PRSS), neuropeptide Y receptor type 1/4/6 (NPY1R_4R_6R) and trace amine associated receptor (trace amine associated receptor (TAAR)).",843964bd-aede-4ee7-8b38-55ec14ca4154
18,methods18," Two additional receptors, the benzodiazepine receptor (benzodiazepine receptor (BZRP)) and glutamate [NMDA] receptor subunit epsilon-2 (GRIN2B), were significantly lowered by time restricted feeding (TRF) Control only; and one, prostaglandin D2 receptor (prostaglandin D2 receptor (PTGDR)), by time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto only.  Within the human diseases level, pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer’s disease, were significantly downregulated following time restricted feeding (TRF). Interestingly, the pathway associated with amyloid beta A4 protein (A4 protein (APP)) was downregulated by time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto only, as was F-type H+-transporting ATPase subunit alpha (ATPeF1a) and NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex 4 (NDUFB4), though NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex 3 (NDUFB3) was significantly affected by both time restricted feeding (TRF) groups.",623d1974-a8f7-4a7e-9009-45f99d3bfcc6
19,methods19," Both time restricted feeding (TRF) groups also significantly reduced pathways associated with F-type H+-transporting ATPase subunit a (ATPeF0A), insulin-degrading enzyme (insulin degrading enzyme (IDE)), and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (C oxidase (COX)1), though cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 (C oxidase (COX)3) was influenced by time restricted feeding (TRF) Control only.  At the systemic level, protein digestion and absorption were significantly influenced by the diets. Specifically, the pathway associated with dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) was upregulated by both time restricted feeding (TRF) diets. Two main areas of transport and catabolism within the cellular processes level were significantly upregulated by both time restricted feeding (TRF) diets: the peroxisome and lysosomes.",00d95de0-893f-47b1-9067-73af62e1db73
20,methods20," Long-chain acyl-CoA (acyl CoA (ACSL)) and catalase (catalase (CAT)), both associated with the peroxisome, and glucosylceramidase (glucosylceramidase (GBA)), hexosaminidase (HEXA_B) and sialidase-1 (NEU1), associated with the lysosome, were all significantly upregulated by both time restricted feeding (TRF) diets.  4. Discussion  In this cohort of male Fisher344 x Brown Norway (FBN) rats, it appears that feeding paradigm (time restricted feeding (TRF) vs. ad libitum) had a significant effect on gut microbiome composition, in addition to macronutrient composition. While others have observed differences in gut microbiome composition following ketogenic diets (KD; reviewed in [63]), we aimed to both replicate this finding as well as expand upon the dearth of information regarding time restricted feeding (TRF) and gut microbiota composition (gut microbiota composition (GMC)).",cc72fba2-6636-49f6-aba2-60a6fa7e4363
21,methods21,"  Our data indicate that while the level of most cytokines remained stable throughout adulthood, aged rats randomized to consume chow ad libitum demonstrated excessive TNFα levels in circulation. This effect was prevented in the rats consuming either the KD or CD with time restricted feeding (TRF). However, significant differences were observed in microbial diversity across both diet groups (i.e., differing macronutrient ratio) and feeding paradigm groups (i.e., time restricted feeding (TRF) vs. ad libitum consumption).  Both diet group and feeding paradigm yielded significantly different gut microbiota composition (GMC). Moreover, differential abundance analysis revealed 22 genera were significantly altered by diet group, and 9 genera were significantly altered by feeding paradigm.",fcf875ab-4824-44bf-beec-a612a1255bb3
22,methods22," Gut microbiome (Gut microbiome (GMB)) diversity assessed by Simpson’s inverse index, which quantifies biodiversity by taking into account richness and evenness, was increased by time restricted feeding (TRF) compared to ad libitum feeding. Consumption of either the time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto or time restricted feeding (TRF) Control diets prevented elevated TNFα levels in circulation that occurred in aged rats consuming the ad libitum diet. This indicates that these changes in Gut microbiome (GMB) diversity and composition documented with time restricted feeding (TRF) feeding paradigm may alter the proinflammatory status in older animals. While it is not surprising that diet macronutrient composition altered the composition and function of the GCM, it is interesting that a time restricted feeding (TRF) feeding paradigm had strong effects on GCM diversity and composition.",503c467b-724a-44f8-a5ef-329337c9efec
23,methods23,"  Our microbiome analysis supports the efficacy of time restricted feeding (TRF) to significantly alter metabolite production and utilization. Specifically, altering food consumption pattern in this study resulted in changes in gut microbes associated with short-chain fatty acid (short chain fatty acid (SCFA)) production. These changes are interesting in light of recent work demonstrating that over-production of gut microbiota-produced acetate (gut microbiota produced acetate (GMPA)) leads to insulin over-secretion and obesity symptoms [64]. This accumulation of acetate, which occurs following consumption of a high-fat diet, results in parasympathetic nervous system activation and over-secretion of insulin and ghrelin.",59e2496a-6960-43d4-ad13-ceef89ea7480
24,methods24," Conversely, the accumulation of gut microbiota-produced butyrate (gut microbiota produced butyrate (GMPB)), but not gut microbiota produced acetate (GMPA), enhances AMPK signaling, reducing expression of lipogenesis-associated genes and triggering insulin sensitivity [65]. Thus, a shift from acetate-producing to butyrate-producing bacteria may improve obesity-related gut dysbiosis and metabolic health.  Akkermansia muciniphila has recently been described as “a next-generation beneficial microbe” [66]. Our data indicate that time restricted feeding (TRF) enriches for the genus Akkermansia, though increases in abundance only reached significance for rats also consuming a time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto, and not the time restricted feeding (TRF) Control, relative to ad libitum-fed rats. Akkermansia influences many aspects of metabolic health, including glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and intestinal immunity.",25dfdf71-5e47-4f6a-969b-d9212c03b107
25,methods25," The anti-diabetes drug Metformin enhances Akkermansia levels [67], which is one possible mechanism by which Metformin appears to be protective against cognitive decline in aged subjects with type II diabetes [68]. Moreover, Akkermansia muciniphila is necessary for the anti-seizure effects of the KD [11], strongly demonstrating the link between neurobiological function and gut microbiome composition.  In addition to Akkermansia muciniphila, there are many ways by which the gut microbiota influence cognitive function. Our metagenomic analysis revealed that in addition to metabolic and other cellular processes, several neurobiological pathways were affected by the diets utilized herein. Firstly, pathways involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases were significantly different across groups.",aac67714-be7c-4373-989b-987b857e243c
26,methods26," The pathway associated with amyloid beta A4 protein (A4 protein (APP)) production was significantly reduced in time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto-fed rats relative to ad libitum-fed rats, but not time restricted feeding (TRF) Control-fed rats. While the full range of functions of A4 protein (APP) remains unknown, cleavage of A4 protein (APP) generates neurotoxic β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), which accumulates within the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [69]. KDs have been suggested to be efficacious in the treatment of AD by numerous groups [70,71,72,73] and recently reviewed in [68] and our data indicate that a potential mechanism by which it is influencing brain pathology may be altered gut microbiome composition. Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly defects in cytochrome C oxidase (C oxidase (COX)), is widely reported within AD [74,75].",50286900-a8bd-4c41-b5de-d0cc4628cadb
27,methods27," Our metagenomic analysis indicates significant alterations in C oxidase (COX) subunits 1 and 3 with both time restricted feeding (TRF) diets and time restricted feeding (TRF) Control only, respectively. Moreover, time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto significantly altered ATPase activity through subunit a, which would also affect a cell’s ability to function normally. Insulin-degrading enzyme (insulin degrading enzyme (IDE)) strongly links metabolic function with AD, as it not only degrades insulin but also Aβ [76], and was significantly decreased following time restricted feeding (TRF) in our dataset.  Secondly, many pathways related to neuroactive ligand signaling were significantly decreased following time restricted feeding (TRF).",65b2e422-96cc-4c15-a905-a043194ba1b5
28,methods28," This includes pathways related to gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit pi (gamma aminobutyric acid receptor subunit pi (GABRP)), melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R), nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gamma (CHRNG), glycine receptor beta (glycine receptor beta (GLRB)) and prostaglandin E receptor 2 (PTGER2). However, whether these changes are limited to localized effects or influence neurotransmitter signaling processes within the brain remains to be determined.  Thirdly, several key pathways involved in the tricarboxylic acid (tricarboxylic acid (TCA)) cycle were significantly upregulated following the time restricted feeding (TRF) diets.",cbb95a36-8552-4e7d-b668-87fc6081ec57
29,methods29," Specifically, malate dehydrogenase (mdh) and 2-oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase subunits alpha and beta (korA and korB) were significantly upregulated by both time restricted feeding (TRF) diets, fumarate hydratase class I (fumA and fumB) and citrate synthase (CS) were upregulated by time restricted feeding (TRF) Keto only and pyruvate carboxylase subunit B (pycB) was upregulated by time restricted feeding (TRF) Control only. Relatedly, other pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism were significantly altered following dietary intervention, which can influence tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function. Several aspects of both the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolic pathway and the glycine, serine and threonine metabolic pathway were significantly altered by one or more of the time restricted feeding (TRF) diets.",b2fcffc1-b50a-492a-aa43-6dd75a29d872
30,methods30," Some of these aforementioned changes in the Gut microbiome (GMB) following time restricted feeding (TRF) may begin to provide mechanistic explanation for the plethora of mental health changes (including depression, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, dementia and AD) following time restricted feeding (TRF), as reviewed in [77].  One caveat to this study, which likely prevented any age-related differences in microbial composition, is that the ‘young’ rats were fully developed adults at the onset of this study, and the chronic nature of the dietary paradigm resulted in rats being closer to middle aged (13 months of age) at the time of sample collection. Future studies initiating diet interventions at earlier time points are needed to resolve age-related differences in the efficacy of time restricted feeding (TRF) paradigms versus macronutrient composition.",1fe8607d-ca5a-4189-b1d5-e7c676393240
31,methods31," Moreover, chronic dietary interventions such as this one may have lower translational potential and the utility of other paradigms, such as cycling on and off the ketogenic diet, may be better targets for future studies [78,79].  There are several possible mechanisms by which time restricted feeding (TRF) would change Gut microbiome (GMB) composition. Firstly, time restricted feeding (TRF) elicits some amount of ketone body production in the liver as soon as 8 h after beginning a fast [80], providing different nutrient sources than typical eating paradigms. Altered nutrient sources for gut microbes significantly influence production of many metabolites, including neurotransmitters and other key enzymes [81,82]. The degree to which ketones directly influence health outcomes via the gut microbiota remains largely unknown, but likely correlates with the abundance of ketotic- vs. glucose-related fuel sources in the gut.",2818955f-3ffd-439a-92a7-bec52d64b970
32,methods32," In fact, recent work demonstrated that ketone production by KD and time restricted feeding (TRF) affected the gut microbiota and disease progression differently in a rat model of AD [83]. Secondly, the timing of food consumption modulates circadian rhythms, which then modulates a host of other physiological functions [84]. This includes the gut microbiota, which undergoes significant restructuring throughout the day [85]. Moreover, this leads to fluctuations in the concentration of key bacterial metabolites, including acetate, propionate and butyrate [86]. Thirdly, time restricted feeding (TRF) is often, though not always, accompanied by weight loss. Obese individuals have significantly altered gut microbiota [87], thus restoration of a more lean phenotype may restore obesity-related gut dysbiosis.",432052bc-9d4e-453f-9e79-13228e776f8a
33,methods33," Moreover, time restricted feeding (TRF) promotes browning of adipose tissue, which may further decrease obesity and/or alter GCM composition [88], though a combination of time restricted feeding (TRF) and Keto reduces brown adipose tissue volume [41].  5. Conclusions  Both macronutrient composition and feeding paradigm result in significant alteration in gut microbiome composition. These changes may mediate improved physiological and cognitive outcomes following dietary implementation, both in healthy individuals and in disease. Moreover, our data indicate that this could be equally effective in older populations, who experience greater cognitive decline and higher incidence of metabolic and neurological disorders.",475b0957-d6c2-482a-89d5-3fe97a8e4341
34,methods34," Given the lack of evidence using pharmaceutical interventions to prevent aging and age-related disease, this new concept of manipulating the gut peripherally to target distal organ health and function may serve as both a first line of evidence-based, low-risk intervention for health care providers seeking to increase patients’ health span, as well as an adjuvant to clinical therapies, through relatively simple dietary intervention. Our data indicate that both types of dietary interventions are capable of altering the gut microbiome in different ways, and selection of dietary interventions may rely on both physiological outcomes and patient preference.
