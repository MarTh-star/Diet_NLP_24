The animal room was maintained at 23 ± 1 °C with 50 ± 5% humidity and illumination from 09:00 to 21:00. All animals were treated in accordance with national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals (Notification of the Prime Minister’s Office of Japan). The Animal Experimental Committee of The University of Tokyo approved all experimental protocols (approval no. 29–10).  During a 7-day acclimation period, the rats were allowed free access to water and a diet based on AIN-93 M formula. All animals were acclimated to the swimming exercise for 10 min per day for 4 days before being divided into the following three groups, matched for body weight and food efficiency.",fc8d497f-2bac-4b73-94c6-d3580cf802ca
1,methods1," One group was continued on the AIN-93 M diet (CON group; n = 7), and the second and third groups were fed ketogenic diets containing LCTs (long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD); n = 7) or MCTs (MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD); n = 7), respectively. Table 1 and Table 2 show the compositions and fatty acid compositions, respectively, of each diet. Half the rats in each group performed a 2-h swimming exercise, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks (EX-CON; n = 7, EX-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD); n = 7, EX-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD); n = 7). Seven rats swam simultaneously in a barrel filled to a depth of 45 cm and with an average surface area of 230 cm2/rat. The temperature of the water was kept at 35 ± 1 °C during the swimming exercise.  All the rats were allowed ad libitum access to the experimental diets, and their food intake and body weight were recorded every second day.",6d55358d-25da-45e8-810c-d1c4bdcce2b4
2,methods2," During the 8-week intervention, approximately 50-µL blood samples were collected from the tail vein using a heparinized microhematocrit capillary tube (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to measure plasma β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) and free fatty acid (free fatty acid (FFA)) levels at weeks 3, 4, 6, and 8. Collected blood samples were immediately separated into plasma and hematocrit by centrifugation (5 min at 10,000 rpm). Plasma samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis.  In a preliminary experiment, we confirmed that MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) elevated plasma βHB concentrations in sedentary rats to a level similar to that induced by long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) intake.",d86f2ac7-1383-4eb0-80f9-d9032d13382c
3,methods3," Additionally, the group fed a large amount of MCTs was excluded from the present study because we found that intake of MCTs at levels equivalent to the intake of LCTs prescribed by the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) treatment induced a remarkable reduction in food intake together with weight loss.  2.2. Tissue Sampling Following the last training session (>20 h after the last bout of exercise), rats were sacrificed under anesthesia with isoflurane. The epitrochlearis and triceps muscles, which are mainly recruited during rat swimming exercises [26], and liver were quickly dissected out, promptly frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Intra-abdominal fat (the epididymal, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal fat pads combined) was removed and weighed.   2.3. Analytical Procedure 2.3.1.",078a702a-e1ca-4da3-b69c-15153ae6b085

The area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)) values for plasma βHB and free fatty acid concentrations above the baseline during the 8-week intervention were determined using the trapezoidal rule.  2.3.2. Muscle and Liver Glycogen Concentration For the measurements of the muscle and liver glycogen concentration, triceps muscle and liver were homogenized with 0.3 M perchloric acid. The glycogen concentrations were determined by the enzymatic methods described by Lowry and Passonneau [27] after acid hydrolysis.  2.3.3. Muscle and Liver Homogenization Frozen epitrochlearis muscle and liver tissues were homogenized in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (EMD Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.",e4a81a61-77ef-4a9f-b770-a1f3d44312c1

The homogenates were frozen and thawed three times to disrupt intracellular organelles and rotated end-over-end at 4 °C for 90 min to solubilize the proteins. Homogenized samples were then centrifuged at 700× g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were harvested.  2.3.4. Western Blotting Protein concentrations of the supernatants were measured with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Samples were prepared in Leammli sample buffer (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) and heated 5 min in a heating block at 95 °C. Equal amounts of sample proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (with 10% or 12.5% resolving gels) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 200 mA for 90 min.",b6e61f84-97ca-4c23-9edb-8cabc3a73c04

After incubation with primary antibodies, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) diluted 1:5000 in Tris buffered saline (TBS)-T containing 1% nonfat powdered milk.",6b170123-1e69-47a4-b5fe-b9ad5b586d6e
7,methods7," Bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare Life Science, Piscataway, NE, USA) and quantified by Image Studio Digits (Ver. 5.2; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). The membranes were stained with Ponceau (Sigma-Aldrich) to verify equal protein loading across lanes. The intensities of immunobands were normalized to the total protein determined by quantifying all Ponceau red-stained bands in the relevant sample lane. We presented the date for protein contents as a fold expression relative to the mean values observed in the SED-CON group.  2.3.5. Stripping and Reproving Membranes The removal of primary and secondary antibodies from the membranes was achieved by incubating the membranes in stripping buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 15 min. Then, membranes were washed for 10 min in Tris buffered saline (TBS)-T and blocked, as indicated above, for 1 h at room temperature.

8,methods8,"6. Statistical Analysis Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (standard error of the mean (SEM)). Statistical analyses were performed using two-way analysis of variance (analyses were performed using two way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) to examine the effects of diet and endurance exercise training. If significant interactions or main effects of diet or endurance exercise training were observed, the Tukey–Kramer multiple-comparison test was performed to examine the differences among groups.   3. Results 3.1. Final Body Weight, Total Energy Intake, Intra-Abdominal Fat Weight and Food Efficiency The EX group had significantly lower final body weight compared with the SED group. Moreover, a significant main effect of diet on the final body weight was observed and was associated with significantly lower body weight in the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) and MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) groups compared with the CON group.",a6632821-d5ab-44df-ae05-3d8c5b30cd31
9,methods9," However, there was no significant difference in the final body weight between the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) and MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) groups (Table 3).   The total energy intake was significantly lower in the EX group than in the SED group. A significant main effect of diet on total energy intake was observed, with the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group having significantly lower total energy intake than the CON and long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) groups (Table 3).  The total intra-abdominal fat weight in the EX group was significantly lower than that observed in the SED group. There was also a significant main effect of diet on total intra-abdominal fat weight. Total intra-abdominal fat weight was significantly lower in the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group compared with the CON and long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) groups (Table 3).",f7d089f7-7bf8-4b73-83b0-801f027719fc
10,methods10,"  A significant interaction between diet and endurance exercise training for food efficiency was observed. Subsequent post hoc tests revealed that in both the SED and EX groups, the food efficiencies in the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) and MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) groups were significantly lower than that observed in the CON group (Table 3).  3.2. Plasma β-Hydroxybutyrate and Free Fatty Acid Concentrations As shown in Figure 1A, dietary intakes of long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) and MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) increased plasma βHB concentrations. A significant interaction between diet and training was observed for plasma βHB area under the curve (AUC) during the 8-week intervention.",487590b5-f248-4037-8435-97c059c168f5
11,methods11," Despite the lower lipid content of the diet, plasma βHB concentration in the SED-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group increased to a level similar to that attained in the SED-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group, and plasma βHB area under the curve (AUC)s were significantly higher in the SED-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) and long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) groups than the SED-CON group. Both the EX-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) and EX-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) groups also had significantly higher plasma βHB area under the curve (AUC)s compared with the EX-CON group and all SED groups. However, the plasma βHB area under the curve (AUC) in the EX-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group was significantly lower than that observed in the EX-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group (Figure 1B).",61b6a5ef-ab50-4386-b845-d55b72310507
12,methods12,"   A main effect of diet or endurance training on plasma free fatty acid (FFA) area under the curve (AUC) during the 8-week intervention was observed. In addition, a significant interaction between diet and endurance exercise training was also observed for plasma free fatty acid (FFA) area under the curve (AUC). The long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) induced substantial increases in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) level (Figure 1C), and plasma free fatty acid (FFA) area under the curve (AUC)s in both the SED- and EX-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) groups were significantly higher than those observed in the respective CON and MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) groups. Moreover, plasma free fatty acid (FFA) area under the curve (AUC) in the EX-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group was significantly higher than that in the SED-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group.",4d1fb656-5c53-494b-a377-0b323451ee7d
13,methods13," In contrast, plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels in both the CON and MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) groups were maintained at the pre-intervention basal level, whereas in both the SED- and EX-groups, there was no significant difference in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) area under the curve (AUC) between the CON and MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) groups (Figure 1D).  3.3. HMGCS2 Protein Content in the Liver Because the rate-limiting step of ketone body synthesis in the liver is the condensation of acetyl-CoA into HMG-CoA by mitochondrial HMGCS2 [28], we evaluated the hepatic HMGCS2 content as a marker of ketone body synthesis capacity (Figure 2). A significant main effect of diet on HMGCS2 protein content was observed and resulted in significantly higher HMGCS2 protein levels in the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group compared with the CON group.",fca8460e-d815-4f21-84b3-24281d56ddf5
14,methods14," Moreover, HMGCS2 protein content tended to be higher in the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group than the CON group (p = 0.08). On the other hand, no significant difference in HMGCS2 protein level was observed between the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) and MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) groups.  3.4. OXCT Protein Content in Epitrochlearis Muscle As a small, polar molecule, βHB is utilized in extrahepatic tissues such as skeletal muscle, heart, and brain tissues. Once taken up by those tissues, βHB is converted to acetoacetyl-CoA for use as an energy substrate in mitochondria by OXCT, whose expression level is thought to reflect the ketolytic capacity of tissues [29].   A main effect of endurance training on OXCT protein expression in epitrochlearis muscle tissue was observed, with the EX group having significantly higher expression compared with the SED group (Figure 3).",c2aa1640-65e4-4b34-b390-bac942fa09c6
15,methods15," Moreover, a significant main effect of diet on muscle OXCT expression was observed. The long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group had significantly higher OXCT protein content in epitrochlearis muscle tissue than did the CON group. A further significant increase in muscle OXCT expression was observed in the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group, resulting in significantly higher OXCT content compared with the CON and long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) groups.  3.5. βHAD Protein Content in Epitrochlearis Muscle Tissue To evaluate fatty acid oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle, we measured protein content of βHAD, which is a key enzyme in fatty acid β-oxidation and has been shown to be significantly associated with fatty acid oxidation rate during exercise [30].  While a positive main effect of diet or endurance training on muscle βHAD protein content was observed, their interaction was also statistically significant (Figure 4).",27dd3889-fbfa-4f59-ac01-1e8e0aeec201
16,methods16," A subsequent post hoc test revealed that the protein expression level of βHAD in epitrochlearis muscle tissue of the EX-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group was significantly higher than those in the other groups.  3.6. PDK4 Protein Content in Epitrochlearis Muscle Tissue Previous studies have demonstrated that extremely low-carbohydrate, very high-fat ketogenic diets reduce the capacity for glucose oxidation in skeletal muscle via upregulation of PDK4 content, which phosphorylates and inactivates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex [18]. Therefore, we evaluated PDK4 protein content as a marker of negative regulation of glycolytic flux.  A main effect of diet or endurance training on muscle PDK4 protein content was observed (Figure 5). Moreover, a significant interaction between diet and endurance exercise training was also observed for PDK4 protein content in epitrochlearis muscle tissue.",08f77759-2129-4b4c-95bf-d3c1b316f193
17,methods17," In both the SED and EX groups, long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) intakes induced a substantial increase in PDK4 protein expression in epitrochlearis muscle tissue. Moreover, muscle PDK4 protein level in the EX-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group was significantly higher than that in the SED-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group. On the other hand, such an increase in PDK4 protein content was not observed in either the SED-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) or EX-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) groups.  3.7. Glycogen Concentrations in Triceps Muscle and Liver Tissues A significant interaction between diet and endurance exercise training on muscle glycogen concentration was observed (Figure 6). Muscle glycogen concentration in the SED-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group was significantly lower than those observed in the SED-CON and -MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) groups.",dfcbbd6e-ac1c-466b-8182-e4d3c8ee92a2
18,methods18," Although the differences did not reach statistical significance, the tissues from the EX-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group tended to have lower muscle glycogen concentrations compared with those from the EX-CON and -MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) groups. In contrast, although muscle glycogen concentration was significantly lower in the SED-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group than the SED-CON group, there was no significant difference between the EX-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) and the EX-CON groups.  A significant interaction between diet and endurance exercise training was observed for liver glycogen concentration. In both the SED and EX groups, liver glycogen concentrations in the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) and MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) groups were significantly lower than those in the CON group.",d80fd5b7-e2fa-4be1-aa3b-96a58e334c12
19,methods19," However, liver glycogen concentration was significantly higher in the EX-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group than the EX-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group.  4. Discussion Ketogenic diets are widely used as a weight loss strategy because they can potently suppress appetite and reduce energy intake [31,32]. Although, in the present investigation, the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD)-fed rats had similar total energy intake relative to the CON group rats, they showed significantly lower body weight and total intra-abdominal fat mass. As shown in Table 3, the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group had lower food efficiency, suggesting that long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) intake may prevent weight gain possibly through an increase in energy expenditure but not a decrease in energy intake.",fb1e60e8-5d6c-4ccb-9c4c-7cd8f8bc44d9
20,methods20," In the present investigation, we observed a further significant decrease in total intra-abdominal fat mass in the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group, especially in the EX-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group (the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) intake and endurance training additively decreased total intra-abdominal fat mass) (Table 3). It has been well documented that MCT intake has body fat–lowering effects because it stimulates diet-induced thermogenesis and energy expenditure [33,34]. In addition, Ooyama et al. reported that MCT ingestion suppresses subsequent food intake in rats, possibly owing to an increase in hepatic ATP content [35].",01b35124-4508-409e-9727-2a0748476f95
21,methods21," Our results showing that the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group exhibited significantly lower total energy intake as well as lower food efficiency confirmed the findings of previous studies and provided additional evidence that the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) is a more effective dietary strategy to control body weight and body fat.  In the SED group, long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) intake elevated plasma βHB concentration by up to ~1.5 mmol/L (Figure 1A). The long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD)-induced ketosis might be mediated, at least in part, by higher expression of hepatic HMGCS2 (Figure 2), which is a rate-limiting factor in the synthesis of ketone bodies [28].",0c5244a6-e7f0-4a56-ab45-1f0372055c9c
22,methods22," In contrast, plasma βHB concentration in the SED-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group increased to a level similar to that attained in the SED-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group without a significant increase in hepatic HMGCS2 expression (Figure 2). MCTs are absorbed via the portal vein and transported directly to the liver, where they are rapidly oxidized and converted to ketone bodies [23,24]. These unique properties made the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) treatment more ketogenic, even though it was composed of more carbohydrates (18% of total energy vs. 1% in the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) treatment) and did not upregulate hepatic HMGCS2 content.",3ad57c30-3daf-4773-a137-a68f251dba10
23,methods23,"  Although both ketogenic diets in combination with endurance training induced further increases in plasma βHB concentration, the EX-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group showed significantly lower plasma βHB concentration compared with the EX-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group (Figure 1A). The lower plasma βHB concentration in the EX-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group might be caused by either diminished ketogenesis in the liver or enhanced ketolysis in other organs such as skeletal muscle. As shown in Figure 3, the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) and endurance training treatments additively increased content of a key ketolytic enzyme, OXCT, in epitrochlearis muscle, resulting in the highest expression in the EX-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group. A previous study demonstrated a significant positive correlation between muscle OXCT content and ketone body utilization [29].",b15e831c-9432-4032-890f-2fea29b57baf
24,methods24," It is therefore more likely that the EX-MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) group could utilize more ketone bodies during training, accounting for their lower plasma βHB concentration compared with the EX-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group.   Oxidation of ketone bodies (βHB) yields more ATP per mole of substrate compared with oxidation of the end-glycolytic substrate pyruvate [36]. In addition, ketone bodies increase the free energy released from ATP hydrolysis by reducing the mitochondrial NAD couple and oxidizing the coenzyme Q couple, thereby increasing the redox span between complex I and complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain [37]. These energetic characteristics of ketone bodies enabled a working, perfused rat heart to increase the efficiency of hydraulic work by ~30% compared with pyruvate [12]. Based on these findings, ketone bodies are therefore thought to be the most energy-efficient fuel.",cba4d67d-d7e1-47cf-b20a-fd22bebdb9dd
25,methods25," The MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) treatment, which additively enhanced the endurance training–induced increase in muscle ketolytic capacity, may therefore be a beneficial dietary intervention to improve endurance exercise performance. Previous studies demonstrated the lower adherence to a conventional ketogenic diet, because it consists exclusively of fat with an extremely limited carbohydrate content [38]. In contrast, the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) treatment employed in this study could induce beneficial metabolic adaptations, as mentioned above, despite there being a relatively higher carbohydrate content (~18% energy from carbohydrates) and therefore might be a more feasible dietary intervention compared with conventional ketogenic diets containing LCTs.   Endurance exercise training and a high-fat diet intake independently and additively increased the protein content of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzymes and fat oxidation capacity in skeletal muscle [39,40].",b1c757fc-c7e7-46fc-bab9-f6dbc2b8bd84
26,methods26," The high-fat diet-induced upregulation of muscle fatty acid oxidation enzymes is thought to be a result of the activation of a nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)) β, by elevated blood free fatty acid (FFA) [41]. In accordance with the previous findings [42,43], the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) treatment substantially elevated plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels with concomitant increases in muscle βHAD protein content, with the EX-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group having the highest values (Figure 1D and Figure 4). In contrast, the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) groups did not show such increases in muscle βHAD protein content, suggesting that the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) treatment enhanced utilization capacity only for ketone bodies, but not fatty acids.",2d2f6df4-b140-46d3-a96d-02444216a581
27,methods27," Consistent with a previous study showing that even larger amounts of MCT failed to produce detectable increases in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) [44], the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD)-fed groups had lower plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels, which led to lower muscle βHAD protein content. Because βHAD is a key enzyme in fatty acid β-oxidation and its activity has been shown to be significantly corelated with fatty acid oxidation rate during exercise [30], the long-term intake of long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD), but not MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD), in combination with endurance training might be a sufficiently strong stimulus to enhance muscle fatty acid utilization capacity.",04839375-9108-4101-b544-04d30b4d2037
28,methods28," However, although fatty acids are important substrates during endurance exercise, metabolism of fatty acids leads to a reduction in mitochondrial NAD and mitochondrial coenzyme Q, thus causing a decrease in the free energy released from ATP hydrolysis and thereby requiring more oxygen [45]. Actually, Burke et al. demonstrated that adaptation to a conventional low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet impaired exercise economy (causing higher oxygen consumption at the same exercise intensity) and negated the performance benefit of intensified training in elite race walkers [7]. Thus, athletes may derive little benefit from conventional ketogenic diets consisting of LCTs.   A major concern associated with ketogenic diet intake in athletes is its effects on carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle [22].",4a5c179c-de20-454e-9a17-24c040d5473c
29,methods29," Numerous studies have shown that very low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diets reduce glycolytic enzyme activity and thus diminish carbohydrate oxidation in humans and animals [7,16,18,46], suggesting that ketogenic diets may impair high-intensity exercise performance, during which carbohydrates are utilized as major energy substrates. Potential mechanisms by which ketogenic diets induced inhibition of glycolytic flux is postulated to be upregulation of PDK4 expression in skeletal muscle [47]. Consistent with previous finding [18], we observed a huge increase in PDK4 protein content in epitrochlearis muscle tissue of the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD)-fed rats, in particular in the EX-long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) group (Figure 5). This result supports the notion that this type of ketogenic diet exerts deteriorating effects on muscle carbohydrate utilization and high-intensity exercise capacity.",7faa4d72-9e97-4d64-9d36-8844dc3cad3d
30,methods30," Because expression of PDK4 as well as βHAD are mediated by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)β [48], the higher plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels in the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) groups might be responsible for the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD)-induced muscle PDK4 expression via activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)β. In contrast, as shown in Figure 5, the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) treatment completely prevented such an increase in muscle PDK4 protein content concomitant with lower plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels, although it contained relatively higher amounts of fat and induced ketosis.",8f7443f6-9ff2-451c-a2a0-34473995df9a
31,methods31," Our results therefore suggest that long-term intake of ketogenic diets containing MCTs and relatively more carbohydrate may enhance the utilization capacity of ketone bodies, which are particularly energy-efficient substrates, in skeletal muscle tissue without exerting inhibitory effects on muscle carbohydrate metabolism.  Previous studies have reported that muscle and liver glycogen concentrations were lower following consumption of a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet [49,50], which may be another contributing factor to the ketogenic diet-induced impairment in high-intensity endurance exercise performance. In this study, as a consequence of their lower carbohydrate intake, both ketogenic diet groups had significantly lower muscle and liver glycogen levels (Figure 6). However, the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD)-fed rats had less reduction in muscle and liver glycogen concentration than did the long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD)-fed rats (Figure 6).",5ceb8bcd-0b1b-4f54-9e6e-50adaa31dba6
32,methods32," These unique characteristics of the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) treatment, which have reduced inhibitory effects on glycogen content as well as glycolytic enzyme levels, make this diet suitable for athletes who need the ability to perform prolonged high-intensity exercise that relies heavily on energy coming from glycolytic pathways.  This study has several limitations. First, we unfortunately could not measure other blood energy substrates such as plasma glucose and evaluate exercise capacity in humans or in rats. Thus, it remains unclear whether MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) treatments have athletic performance–enhancing effects or not, especially in prolonged high-intensity exercise. Second, this study was performed on only male rats. The results obtained in this study may not be directly extrapolated to female rats as well.",f14d0063-8e54-4271-8d18-2ffe981a4f6e
33,methods33," Finally, we did not evaluate the effect of intake of long chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (LKD) containing more carbohydrate at levels equivalent to the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD) in this study. We therefore could not rule out the possibility that consumption of relatively more carbohydrate rather than MCTs intake was responsible for the MCT containing ketogenic diet (MKD)-induced adaptations. Future extensive studies are required to solve these issues.  5. Conclusions Long-term intake of a ketogenic diet containing MCTs and relatively more carbohydrate may reduce body weight and intra-abdominal fat mass and additively enhance endurance training-induced ketolytic capacity in skeletal muscle of male rats without exerting inhibitory effects on carbohydrate metabolism.
