0,introduction0," Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)) affects over 300 million patients worldwide and is currently the third ranked cause of death globally (1). Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by slowly progressive airflow limitation as a result of peripheral airway obstruction (chronic bronchiolitis) and lung parenchymal destruction (emphysema), which lead to increasing shortness of breath on exertion (2). Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is further associated with inflammation of the lung, including the recruitment of macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes and the secretion of multiple inflammatory mediators, including cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF (3). This pulmonary inflammation is not reduced by the mainstay of current therapy, inhaled long-acting bronchodilators, and is also largely resistant to corticosteroids (4).",cc966685-16c6-40e0-93d5-484573075d1f
1,introduction1," Targeting of individual cytokines has been unsuccessful, reflecting the fact that many mediators are involved in pathogenesis of the disease (5). Importantly, there are no current therapies that significantly improve disease progression. Therefore, there is a pressing need to find broader spectrum anti-inflammatory treatments for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) that will improve symptoms, disease progression, and patient quality of life (6).  Ketogenic diets (KD) have a near century long history of being used to treat pediatric epilepsy (7), and newer research is beginning to explore their therapeutic potential in other chronic disease, such as type II diabetes (8, 9), polycystic ovarian syndrome (10), Alzheimer's disease (11), Parkinson's disease (12), cardiovascular risk (13), metabolic syndrome (14), and various mental illnesses (15).",762923ce-aa40-46ff-a2cb-60246cef7453
2,introduction2," Many of these disease have an inflammatory component and, correspondingly, well-formulated ketogenic diets have been shown to improve a broad spectrum of inflammatory markers (16).  The anti-inflammatory effects of KD may be mediated, in part, by the ability of the ketone molecule, β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome (17, 18). NLRP3 is a protein complex that positively regulates the inflammatory response, and inhibition of NLRP3 is a mechanism whereby βHB is thought to mitigate inflammatory conditions such as gout (19). NLRP3 is also elevated in active Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), as measured by circulating and local levels of NLRP3, Asc, and caspase-1 mRNAs (20). These mechanistic data, along with the clinical data mentioned above, suggest that a KD could have a beneficial effect in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients, possibly by inhibiting NLRP3.",76715708-b5db-4fde-8388-f8016bd42d12
3,introduction3,"  With respect to pulmonary diseases, KD improve symptoms in asthma (21) and trials are ongoing to determine whether KD may protect against severe COVID-19 disease, including lung disease (22). Importantly, a 3-week controlled trial including 60 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients demonstrated a small but significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) with a lower carbohydrate group (47% calories from carbohydrates) compared to a higher carbohydrate group (65% calories from carbohydrates) (23). In this study 10% of calories in the lower carbohydrate group were obtained from medium chain triglycerides to induce mild ketosis.  While Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an inflammatory disease and KD are known to be anti-inflammatory, there are no reports of KD being used to treat Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) existing in the medical literature.",b71055ce-b55e-4953-9d4b-b086a178eb7e
4,introduction4," Herein we report on such a case in which an individual with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) adopted a KD and subsequently observed improvements in inflammatory markers and lung function.  Case Description  The subject of this study (C.A.) is a 54-year-old male in whom Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) was diagnosed in 2011, at age 45 years. Early in childhood, at age 10, C.A. was diagnosed with asthma. He also smoked cigarettes from age 17 and to 37 (~15 pack-years) and his grandfather died of lung cancer at age 67. C.A.'s only co-morbidity was and remains asthma, and he is free of other common comorbidities of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), including diabetes, pre-diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, sleep or mood disorders, metabolic syndrome, or obesity.  In year prior to diagnosis, C.A.'s chief complaints were worsening shortness of breath and more frequent chest infections. In 2011, spirometry showed an FEV1 of 0.",674b5776-3741-44a3-9edc-521072cb796a
5,introduction5,"79L (22% predicted normal) with an FEV1/FVC ratio of 40%. There was an increase in lung volume measured by body plethysmography, with an increase in air trapping, but there was no reduction in gas transfer. There was no significant bronchodilator response to inhaled salbutamol, nor any response to a trial of oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 40 mg od for 4 weeks). A computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of emphysema, indicating that the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is due to small airway disease. C.A. was diagnosed with very severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 4) and was treated with inhaled tiotropium bromide once daily and budesonide-formoterol combination twice daily, which he has continued. He has also taken zinc and vitamin C supplements daily since his diagnosis in 2011.  Over the ensuring 4 years C.A.",d4fc8d11-15c0-41f1-b623-07f3c7ef628f
6,introduction6," undertook an aerobic exercise program consisting of daily running, cycling or swimming and ate a “balanced diet” consisting of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, including fruits, vegetables and whole grains. In association with his daily activity and diet, his BMI decreased (from 29.4 kg/m2 at time of diagnosis in 2011 to 23.8 kg/m2 in 2017), his exercise maximal peak capacity increased from 165 to a peak of 193 watts, as measured by cycle ergometer, and his FEV1 improved only marginally to 0.91L (25% predicted normal).  In 2017, he began a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet KD. The macronutrient composition of the diet comprised calories from 70% fat, 20% protein, and 10% carbohydrates and C.A. confirmed nutritional ketosis of >0.5 mmol/L daily by fingerstick using an Abbott Optium Neo device that measured blood D-βHB. While on the KD, he lost no more weight, remaining at a BMI of 23.8 kg/m2 at the time of the 2019 and 2020 measurements listed below.",4f1d61f1-152b-41af-8ffc-2e22c66ac842
7,introduction7,"  Prior to starting the KD, baseline plasma TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF, concentrations were 16, 4.9, 13.9, 499, and 193.5 pg/mL, respectively, and CRP was 7 mg/L. All measurements were above the upper threshold of normal. In 2019, 2 years into his KD, blood concentrations decreased to 3.4 (TNF-α), 0.6 (IL-1β), 4.2 (IL-6), 2.7 (IL-8), and 21.6 pg/mL (GM-CSF), and CRP was 1 – 2 mg/L (Figure 1). These measurements were repeated in 2020, with maintenance of the KD, and results were similar. On both occasions all post-KD inflammatory markers were within the normal range with the singular exception of the 2020 IL-8 (62 pg/mL), although this measure still represented an 8-fold decrease from its pre-KD level. All three cytokine panels were ordered direct to consumer (NutriPath) by C.A. The 2017 baseline test was ordered for interest following his self-study on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). At this time, there was no thought of a case report; however, C.A.",d8fc3d3e-9b0e-4b78-ab6b-3fc7c3c1dc09
8,introduction8,"'s response to dietary change was—in his perspective (below)—so remarkable that, in 2019, he decided he wanted to collect follow-up data to correlate with his improved symptoms and quality of life out of interest. He also ordered the 2020 tests as a replicate.  Figure 1 Inflammatory biomarkers. Data represent C.A.'s inflammatory biomarkers prior to starting a ketogenic diet and at two time points, 2019 and 2020, after commencing the diet. Green dotted line represent the threshold of normal range for each biomarker. All markers improved on a ketogenic diet.  In conjunction with the improvement in inflammatory blood biomarkers (Figure 1), C.A.'s FEV1 improved to 1.24 (35% predicted) and 1.25L in 2019 and in 2020, respectively, representing an improvement in FEV1 of 38% relative to pre-KD measurements (Figure 2). All lung function tests, including the baseline test, were administered 24 h after stopping bronchodilators.",23eb241c-6c09-459f-a0fb-aa6c5766172b
9,introduction9," Prior to the diet he suffered from 1 to 2 acute exacerbations/year but reported no exacerbations since taking the KD. He also reported improvement in symptoms and quality of life, with reduced use of rescue salbutamol inhaler from 3 to 4 puffs daily before the KD to only one or less puffs on the diet. His exercise tolerance also improved markedly to the extent that he was able to complete marathons.  Figure 2 Forced expiratory volume in 1 s. Data represent C.A.'s FEV1 at four time points prior to starting a ketogenic diet and at two time points, 2019 and 2020, after commencing the diet. ",0ae190a1-212e-41db-b61c-bd2be14198cf
10,discussion0," C.A. suffers from severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), predominantly due to small airway disease and showed only modest improvement in symptoms and lung function with maximal inhaler therapy (inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting muscarinic antagonist and long-acting β2-agonist), as recommended by current management strategies (24). After switching to a KD, he had reduced symptoms and improved exercise tolerance, used less rescue inhaler and had no further acute exacerbations. His FEV1 improved by over 35%, relative to baseline, whereas there had previously been no significant improvement with a bronchodilator or a systemic corticosteroid. Furthermore, between 2011 and 2017, his self-prescribed exercise program increased his FEV1 from 0.79L (22% predicted normal) to FEV1 from 0.91L (25% predicted normal), in conjunction with a BMI decrease from 29.4 to 23.8 kg/m2. By comparison, the addition of a KD was associated with a much larger improvement in FEV1 to 1.24 and 1.",dafc41b0-2270-4d47-97e2-1218f78fa150
11,discussion1,"25, in 2019 and 2020, respectively (~35% predicted), without any change in weight. As the KD improved C.A.'s exercise tolerance, it's possible that there was a synergy between the KD and exercise, i.e., that the KD acted as a therapeutic adjunct. It is also possible, and perhaps more likely, that the KD had an independent effect.  The clinical improvements C.A. experienced after adopting the KD were accompanied by a marked fall in plasma concentrations of several inflammatory cytokines known to be increased in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL6, IL-8, GM-CSF, and CRP) that were elevated prior to the diet. While the data on hand do not permit us to draw a causal conclusion that the KD improved C.A.",c9e77953-fd7b-4719-bd49-fa7639326032
12,discussion2,"'s Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the coincident drop in serum cytokines and improvements in FEV1, along with prior clinical and non-clinical literature demonstrating anti-inflammatory and therapeutic beneficial effects of a KD in inflammatory disorders, suggest that a KD could have potential for the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This is an area that deserves more structured investigation.  Several dietary interventions have been evaluated in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), mainly with a view to increasing skeletal muscle mass as well as addition of nutraceuticals, such as antioxidant vitamins and vitamin D, but so far there is no convincing evidence for the efficacy of these diets, and they are not recommended in the routine management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients (25). Since diagnosis in 2011, C.A.",9ad48610-b330-45fa-a5a9-13242ac03dac
13,discussion3," only ever reported consuming a zinc and vitamin C supplement and their dosing did not change upon starting a KD. Dietary interventions may theoretically benefit the lung disease, but also the comorbidities that are commonly seen in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients (26), including diabetes, pre-diabetes, obesity, ad metabolic syndrome, although C.A. presented with none of these conditions nor did the KD cause C.A. to lose weight. Furthermore, dietary interventions may be more acceptable to patients than long-term drug therapies, which have poor adherence in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (27). Conversely, despite the common conception that KD are not sustainable for patients, trials show that patients given adequate education and support adhere to and enjoy KD as much as other diets and standard of care (8, 28).",6739986c-c80b-4818-9b61-cab13d288fdd
14,discussion4,"  Although a KD has been shown to improve asthma, there are no previous reports of its use in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients. Given the parallel decrease in cytokines and improvement in FEV1, it is possible, if not likely, that the direct anti-inflammatory effect of the KD mediate part of the therapeutic benefit of the lifestyle in this case. βHB is known to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome (17, 18), which plays a pathological role in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (20). Ketogenic diets have also been shown to lower a wide range of inflammatory cytokines and have been shown to outperform isocaloric low-fat diets in their ability to lower TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 (16) and reverse insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (14), which are common inflammatory comorbidities associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (29, 30).",ea4613ad-594f-4a94-8845-2ebda391a2c7
15,discussion5,"  Another possible mechanism for the clinical improvement in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) may be a change in the gut or lung microbiome. Lung microbiome is abnormal in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and patients with severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) commonly have colonization of the lower respiratory tract with bacteria such as Haemphilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella cattarhalis (31, 32). These colonizing bacteria may be important in inducing a chronic inflammatory response, with increases in cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. Correspondingly, mouse data suggest that changes in the microbiome mediate some of the therapeutic effects of ketogenic diet against epilepsy (33) and that KDs can alter the microbiome to protect against activation of Th17 cells and other inflammatory mediators (34).",82d02db8-65ac-4dc0-a338-029956b97938
16,discussion6,"  An obvious limitation of this case study is that the data do not allow us to draw conclusions about the mechanism of action by which a KD improved inflammation and respiratory function in the patient, C.A. We can only note the striking association among the onset and maintenance of KD and concomitant improvements in all measured inflammatory markers and FEV1. Nevertheless, C.A.'s improvements make mechanistic sense in the context of the broader literature on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) as an inflammatory disorder and KD as an anti-inflammatory intervention. Future animal model research should focus on exploring the mechanisms of action of KD on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and related respiratory conditions with a mind toward providing patients with a lifestyle option to treat disease and improve quality of life.",a81a1af2-0d08-4beb-9d59-ed52fcc30f03
17,discussion7,"  Patient Perspective  After my Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) diagnosis, I made a commitment to myself that I would do anything I could to improve my health so took up running, swimming, and cycling. Even though, I wasn't very good, I especially loved distance running. I started listening to podcasts and reading about how nutrition could improve my breathing and endurance running performance. The information I gathered suggested a low-carb ketogenic diet could help burn fat as fuel more efficiently, I thought I'd give it a go. I was surprised to find my breathlessness diminished as soon as I was in ketosis and, 4 months later, I ran my personal best marathon time of 5½ h, which for me was astonishing. I started to notice when I adhered to my diet my breathing was less labored. Encouraged, I started to read more including a paper that showed ketones inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome. I had also read about the NLRP3 and its role in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).",bf22f7bc-c6f1-4298-8796-6abafd929d56
18,discussion8," I asked a respiratory professional whom I met at a conference, “what if we had a medication to inhibit NLRP3?” He said, “that could represent a remarkable step forward in the treatment and patient care.” That sealed it for me. I've been on a ketogenic diet ever since and, combined with my exercise, my respiration appears to be ever improving. It's unlikely I'll ever have completely normal breathing, but I'm so grateful to being trending upward, not downward. I hope my experience will encourage others to try a lifestyle that significantly improved my quality of life.  Limitations  As with any retrospective n = 1 patient case, this report contains limitations that must be acknowledged. (i) First, the duration of time between the initiation of the KD and subsequent FEV1 and cytokine tests was ~2 years. It is plausible that other changes in the patient's lifestyle during this time contributed to his symptomatic and inflammatory improvements.",bcec77a5-3b45-49bb-aae9-7e9e4e26870b
19,discussion9," While the patient attests that “I was surprised to find my breathlessness diminished as soon as I was in ketosis,” and that “when I adhered to my diet my breathing was less labored,” and that he ran his personal best marathon time 4 months after the initiation of his diet, these data are self-reported and/or subjective and should be taken as such. (ii) Second, and building on the above, there is the possibility of a placebo interaction. As the patient was encouraged about the possibility that a ketogenic diet could improve his athletic performance and symptoms, it is feasible that this optimism changed his exercise confidence, or other aspects of lifestyle, contributing to his improvements. It is also possible that his enthusiasm and optimism led him to order the direct-to-consumer cytokine panels at symptomatically favorable moments when inflammation might have been in a trough.",293fcc2a-ba75-49f8-aac6-0ff18793938a
20,discussion10," Although he denies this was the case, and it seems unlikely that a placebo interaction could explain the full effect and its consistency (assuming the effect is genuine and due to the diet), it is an important caveat, nonetheless. (iii) Third, the patient represents a highly particular case of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), as most patients are not marathon runners and do not engage in intensive physical activities. It would therefore be premature to generalize the findings of this report to a wider Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) population. (iv) Finally, it would have been ideal to not only have more data timepoints but also more functional measures of lung function. Unfortunately, as this is a retrospective case, the data are limited to that which the patients and treating physician had available to us.",a3f1cae8-ac82-4414-b6a2-972f09369e64
21,discussion11,"  Summary  We report on a case in which initiation and continuation of a ketogenic diet was associated with improvements in the lung function and inflammatory markers of a patient with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). As ketogenic diets have the potential to be anti-inflammatory diets, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an inflammatory disorder, and ketogenic diets are being explored for an increasing array of inflammatory conditions, this case suggests ketogenic diets could have therapeutic potential in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and that more research is needed.
