0,background0,"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (autism spectrum disorder (ASD)) have a 3 to 22-fold increase in the risk of developing epilepsy as compared to typically developing individuals and up to 25% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will experience a clinical seizures at some point in their life [1,2]. However, the relationship between epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is complex [3]. For example, a significant number of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) manifest epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalograph (epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalograph (EEG)) despite a lack of clinical seizures, and many of these epileptiform abnormalities do not meet criteria for electrographic seizures [4].",ccbd83a0-b6b8-4113-9679-d2bd615ba703
1,background1,"  Despite the high prevalence of seizure, epilepsy and abnormal epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalograph (EEG)s in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), there is little information regarding the relative effectiveness of treatments for epilepsy, seizure or subclinical epileptiform discharges in this population. There is good reason to believe that specific antiepileptic drugs (antiepileptic drug (AED)s) might be effective for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). For example, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with cortical hyperexcitability, potentially due to deficits in cortical inhibitory circuits [5]. This suggests that antiepileptic drug (AED)s that enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid pathways might be relatively better treatments for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",4bb647b2-c8cb-4ba9-ab85-17d5483aca08
2,background2," Additionally, the non-seizure effects of antiepileptic drug (AED)s, such as mood regulation, could be particularly helpful in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [6]. Finally, older antiepileptic drug (AED)s tend to have higher rates of adverse effects, particularly with respect to attention, mood and cognition [7,8]. Since individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) already have problems with attention, mood and cognition, prescribing an antiepileptic drug (AED) with such adverse effects might result in poor overall function even if seizures are controlled. Thus, the first purpose of this study was to determine whether there are specific antiepileptic drug (AED)s that are more appropriate to use in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) use non-traditional treatments, such as special diets and nutritional supplements [9,10].",74e90880-d47f-41e8-bd35-0fbe7d1bb4e9
3,background3," Some non-traditional treatments may help with the frequency and severity of seizures since many of these treatments target inflammation and oxidative stress [9,11,12], two pathological processes believed to be involved in the pathogenesis and propagation of seizures [13-15]. Thus, a second purpose of this study was to determine whether there are any non-traditional treatments that may be effective for treating seizures in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  To shed light on the ability of treatments used in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to affect seizures and other important clinical characteristics associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we developed an on-line seizure survey to investigate parental perceptions about the effect of treatments for their children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on seizures.",6598e94e-6ac0-4979-8a7b-25486d62d2e4
4,background4," This survey included questions on seizure characteristics, comorbid medical conditions, the effect of traditional antiepileptic drug (AED) and non-antiepileptic drug (AED) seizure treatments and non-traditional autism spectrum disorder (ASD) treatments on seizures, behavior and cognition, and adverse effects of treatments. The survey was designed to keep the completion time to less than 30 minutes. Although parental reports have their limitations, seizure treatment is often an individualized trial-and-error process, thus, it was the third purpose of this study to provide data that may help clinicians select treatments which are more likely to reduce seizures with minimal side-effects, and to help increase the awareness of treatment side-effects.

5,methods0,"Institutional Review Board Approval This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Institutional Review Board. Since the survey was anonymous and did not contain any unique indentifying information or protected health information, the study qualified for category 2 exempt status according to 45 CFR 46.101(b). Information regarding Institutional Review Board approval and contact information was provided on the first page of the survey.  Survey Development The first and last authors drafted an invitation letter and survey. The survey was designed using the principles outlined by Keenan [16] as implemented with the SurveyMethods, Inc. website software (http://www.SurveyMethods.com). Straightforward unambiguous non-open-ended questions were used when possible. The survey was designed to be comprehensive in the variety of possible responses so as to eliminate the need for free text entry.",66b5a4d9-0fad-45e3-9bbe-9224de6872cf
6,methods1," In order to reduce perceived bias of the survey for a specific type of treatment, the survey was designed to include a wide range to treatments commonly used in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), both traditional treatments for seizures as well as non-traditional treatments.  The first page of the survey provided the responder with basic information regarding the purpose of the survey, a statement regarding the host institution and regulatory approval from the institution and an approximate completion time. The second page of the survey provided the responder with more specific information regarding the structure of the survey, the correct manner in which to respond to specific questions and contact information for the principal investigator if the responder wanted more information or had any questions. The survey did not record any identifying information of the responder nor did it ask for any protected health information identifiers.",a80549ed-6d1a-4d7e-8524-a053a99acf1f
7,methods2," The survey was designed to be easy to answer with validation checks for each response and used skipping logic to make the survey easy and efficient to answer. Except where noted, answers were providing by multiple checkbox, rating scales, yes/no questions or specific fill in the blank questions. Very few open-ended questions or questions that required free text entry were used.  Some basic information was collected about each child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) including current age, gender, spectrum diagnosis and developmental profile, commonly associated medical conditions (a text box was provided for entering other medical conditions not listed), and the practitioners that manage the child's medical and developmental disorders.  Specific information regarding seizures was also queried. Responders indicated practitioners that managed or rule-out the seizure disorder and the type of test used to diagnose or rule out seizures.",7a5c3a7a-3ae9-4d9e-bfe4-96a60cdaf837
8,methods3," Responders indicated whether the individual with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had any of the following seizure types: generalized, partial complex, absence, typical or atypical Landau-Kleffner syndrome, subclinical epileptiform discharges, Lenox-Gastaut syndrome and/or infantile spasms. These choices were provided in a checkbox fashion so that multiple seizure types could be indicated. Next to each common seizure type was a detailed description of the seizure type to help the responder select the correct seizure type. There was also a checkbox for the responder to place other seizure types if the seizure types listed were not sufficient. Other information regarding seizures (including age of onset and age of resolution of seizures if the seizures resolved) was also collected.  Following collection of this basic descriptive information, the respondents were asked to indicate if their child had been treated with a wide range of treatments.",a5c7dcda-7421-449d-98d3-56a54392ed73
9,methods4," Information for each treatment was collected in a sequential manner. For each treatment, a page would appear with a yes/no question asking the respondent whether a specific treatment had been used. Both generic and brand names, inclusive of all known brand names, were included in the question. If the respondent answered 'yes' they were directed to a page where they could rate the perceived effect of the treatment and list the adverse effects. If they answered 'no' the respondent was questioned about the next treatment. This skip logic in the software eliminated the need for the respondent to understand which questions needed to be answered and which needed to be skipped, thereby eliminating potential confusion that can occur with conditional questions in surveys. Additional pages asked the respondent if their child was treated for seizures with a treatment that was not mentioned.",e7eb62cb-f547-48cf-9e2f-378bd3670127
10,methods5," If the respondent answered 'yes', a page appeared which included a text box to enter the information regarding the treatment along with a page to rate the perceived effect of the treatment and any adverse effects.  For each treatment, the respondent was asked to rate the perceived effect of the treatment on seizures, sleep, receptive and expressive language, verbal and non-verbal communication, stereotyped/repetitive movements, rigidity, hyperactivity, attention and mood. A seven point scale was used that ranged from a substantial negative effect, a moderate negative effect, to a mild negative effect to no effect to a mild positive effect, a moderate positive effect, to a substantial positive effect. All ratings for this complex multi-dimensional construct of the perceived treatment effect were included on the same page to facilitate the respondent's use of the same psychometric scale. The rating scale was designed to be symmetric (i.e.",88366700-15ab-4691-a44e-4fa200cc6b82
11,methods6,", same number of positive and negative ratings) in order to minimize response bias. Three sets of text boxes were provided to enter any adverse effect, the severity of the adverse effect and the frequency of the adverse effect. This allowed the respondent to enter up to three adverse effects.  Survey Validation The survey and participant invitation letter were developed with the advice of a wide variety of experts with experience in the treatment of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A copy of the invitation letter and a link to the initial survey were sent to participants of the Elias Tembenis Seizures Think Tank (which took place at the AutismOne Meeting in Chicago in May of 2009) approximately one month before the think tank. The participants of this think talk represented a wide variety of practitioners who treat autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (See See Additional file 1, Appendix A).",7b0d3f1d-e102-4687-95f0-ca19c61aed06
12,methods7," Participants were asked to complete the survey as many times as necessary to get familiar with the survey. During the day-long think tank the first and last authors led a discussion querying the participants on their opinion regarding the specific information about the children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and seizures, the treatments that should be surveyed and the specific effect of each treatment that should be asked as well as the wording of the survey. Over the weeks following the survey, changes were made to the initial survey and invitation letter as a result of the suggestions of the members of the think tank. Participants were again asked to complete the survey and provide additional comments by email. The survey was again modified and the participants were again asked to review the survey.",a212bc1d-f007-4c66-aad0-f1987759e43a
13,methods8," After no further suggestions were made, the first and last authors recruited volunteer parents with children affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and seizures to review the survey and invitation letter. The survey and invitation letter were sent to these volunteers and their suggestions were integrated into the survey and letter and the modified survey and letter were again sent out for review to these volunteers. After no more significant comments were received, the final survey and invitation letter were prepared.  Treatments Surveyed The expert group decided on including the following treatments for the survey.",c61ecd7e-623b-4f90-a566-e23778315dbb
14,methods9," Traditional seizure treatments included valproic acid, phenytoin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, caramazapine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, pyridoxine, clonazepam, phenobarbitol, zonisamide, gabapentin, felbamate, ethosuximide, tigabine, primidone, vigabatrin, neurofeedback, ketogenic diet, Atkin's or modified Atkin's diet, steroids, vagus nerve stimulation, surgery, intravenous immunoglobulin, transcranial magnetic stimulation/direct current stimulation. Non-traditional treatments included gluten free casein free diet, specific carbohydrate diet, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, 5-Hydroxytryptophan, gamma-aminobutyric acid, dimethylglycine, taurine, chelation therapy, co-enzyme Q10, B6, gluatathione, magnesium, B12, L-carnitine/Acetyl-L-carnitine, L-carnosine, minocycline, bacopa, actos, and spironolactone.  Although children were likely provided multiple treatments at the same time, information regarding response to specific treatment was queried individually for each treatment.",519f5716-611e-4075-833d-538b72ac5029
15,methods10," This assumes that each treatment is having an influence independent of the other treatments. The authors and the expert group believe this was a necessary limitation since asking about each combination of treatments would create a questionnaire that would be prohibitively long and complex. In addition, it is likely that the number of respondents with experience with specific treatment combinations would be prohibitively small for a valid analysis. From a practical point of view, most practitioners usually start and/or stop treatments independent each other so that the clinical effect (and adverse effect) can be determined for the specific treatment.  Questions Included in the Survey But Not Addressed In This Study In addition to questions regarding seizures, the survey contained a small section in the beginning that asked about the effect of allergies and season on seizures and behavior.",6d0120ca-d144-4f76-bc1b-98b66346c76d
16,methods11," Additional questions within the survey also asked about over- or under-reactivity to external stimuli and the effect of treatments on such reactivity. These aspects of the survey are not addressed in this manuscript.  Control Survey In order to determine a baseline for the data collected on children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and seizures, a control survey was developed to gather information regarding children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) without seizures (henceforth described as the control survey). This control survey contained all of the questions that the seizure survey contained except for specific questions about seizures (e.g., ""What type of seizures has your child been diagnosed with?""). All treatments in the seizure survey were included in the control survey but a rating for the effect of the treatment on seizures was not included.",d6c86fc9-d214-4d98-a3e3-364f96da463d
17,methods12," Questions were included regarding whether the child had been evaluated for seizure, what type of practitioner evaluated the child and what test, if any, had been done to rule-out seizures.  Recruitment An invitation letter (See See Additional file 1, Appendix B) for the on-line survey was posted on the website and in email newsletters of the Autism Research Institute (Autism Research Institute (ARI)) and approximately 30 local and national autism spectrum disorder (ASD) support groups for parents of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The non-Autism Research Institute (ARI) support groups included Autism Speaks, several local chapters of the Autism Society of America and ARC and other local support groups for families of autism.",5736db3d-6f1d-4dde-8f69-9f86435f9a25
18,methods13," The letter specifically asked parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) both with and without seizures to follow one of two web links depending on whether or not their child had clinical seizures, subclinical epileptiform discharges or seizure-like activity. These web links activated different surveys located on the SurveyMethods, Inc. website (http://www.SurveyMethods.com). Identical letters were used for Autism Research Institute (ARI) and non-Autism Research Institute (ARI) websites except that the links referred to surveys that stored responses in different databases. This allowed responses to exact same seizure or control survey questions to be stored in different databases depending on whether the respondent had followed the link from the Autism Research Institute (ARI) or non-Autism Research Institute (ARI) webpage.",210e1381-c1bd-49e3-ab6b-23f0d90a5ac4
19,methods14,"  Survey Response Reduction The frequencies of specific genetic conditions were very low so all responses for specific genetic disease were included as a general genetic condition response. Treatments with less than 20 total responses were excluded from all analyses. These included surgery, transcranial magnetic stimulation/direct current stimulation, tigabine, primidone, vigabatrin, neurofeedback, minocycline, bacopa, actos, and spironolactone. Treatments with less than 20 responses for the subclinical seizure group were excluded from the subclinical seizure treatment analysis. These included ethosuximide, phenytoin, clonazepam, gabapentin, zonisamide, felbamate, phenobarbitol, vagus nerve stimulator, intravenous immunoglobulin, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, dimethylglycine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and specific carbohydrate diet.",63ee7040-0fd2-453c-9a42-627345f2e2f4
20,methods15," For the subclinical seizure treatment analysis, responses for the ketogenic diet and Atkin's or modified Atkin's diet were combined because of their similarity in order to prevent elimination due to too few responses.  Statistical Analysis Chi-squares were used to analyze bivariate variables. To mitigate the effect of multiple comparisons, for each set of comparisons made, the Bonferroni correction was calculated to correct the alpha cutoff. The caption of each table explains the appropriate Bonferroni correction.  Ratings were converted into an ordinal scale ranging from 1 to 7 for analysis: substantial negative effect (1), a moderate negative effect (2), a mild negative effect (3), no effect (4), a mild positive effect (5), a moderate positive effect (6), and a substantial positive effect (7). Although the response scale was ordinal, the response distribution was found to be normally distributed allowing the use of parametric analyses for treatment ratings.",ff4307e4-37d7-4afd-8667-66cb538e8568
21,methods16,"  Comparing every treatment to every other treatment would result in a very large number of comparisons (>500), thereby considerably increasing the probability of a type I error. To reduce the number of comparisons we investigated whether multiple treatments could be clustered together into treatments that showed the same pattern of ratings for seizures and other clinical factors (i.e., sleep, communication, behavior, attention, mood) and then compared the ratings from each treatment cluster to other treatment clusters.  For the cluster analysis, seizure types were divided into two broad categories: clinical (generalized, partial complex, absence) and subclinical (typical and atypical Landau-Kleffner syndrome, subclinical epileptiform discharges). Lenox-Gastaut syndrome and infantile spasms were not considered in this manuscript.",4a8103a7-288a-4c6a-8ee6-8b448644fc02
22,methods17," For the cluster analysis, two summary scales were calculated to reduce the number of rating scales: receptive and expressive language and verbal and non-verbal communication ratings were averaged to create a rating called communication and stereotyped/repetitive movements, rigidity and hyperactivity ratings were averaged to create a rating called behavior. For subclinical seizures we did not include the seizure ratings in the cluster analysis as the primary manifestations of subclinical seizures are other clinical factors and seizures are not reliably detected in individuals with subclinical seizures.  Cluster analysis was conducted using Ward's technique [17]. The Ward's technique defines the distance between treatments in terms of the between cluster variability to the within cluster variability. The Ward's technique is a hierarchical analysis that starts with n clusters, one for each treatment, and then at each step groups the most similar treatments into clusters.",dece9702-1301-4309-941c-27f74046070a
23,methods18," This procedure continues until there is one cluster containing all respondents. By examining the dendogram and several statistics (pseudo F and t), a judgment is made about the number of clusters [18].  The ratings of treatments within each cluster were compared to the rating from other clusters using a mixed-model analysis-of-variance (a mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA)) with two fixed-effects: cluster and seizure type (generalized, partial complex, absence for clinical seizures and Landau-Kleffner syndrome, atypical Landau-Kleffner syndrome, subclinical epileptiform discharges for subclinical seizures), and the interaction between these factors. The a mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was calculated using the 'glimmix' procedure of SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with respondent and seizure type as a random variable. Seizure type and the interaction were not significant in any analysis.",0e392e18-b605-4e94-8647-b6fbeb09c2e2
24,methods19," Statistical values for the analysis of variables are presented in supplementary tables (See Additional file 2) along with the calculation for the Bonferroni correction. The statistical values for the seizure type and the interaction effects were not included in the tables since they were not significant. For selected clusters, individual treatments were compared using a similar a mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA).  Planned contrasts were used to compare ratings. Planned contrasts were calculated using the 'estimate' command in SAS for the 'glimmix' procedure. The procedure uses both the fixed-effects and random-effects matrices to construct a matrix with an approximate t distribution. The unadjusted t-values and p-values are presented and the Bonferroni correction was used to calculate the appropriate alpha levels for each set of comparisons.",1d157568-82c8-4d98-aa1f-b4ea9c74c851

26,results0,"Characteristics of seizure and control groups Overall, 1023 responders completed the surveys, with 733 responses concerning children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and clinical seizures, subclinical epileptiform discharges or seizure-like activity and 290 control responses. Seven invalid responses were deleted.  In both the seizures and control surveys, 77% of the children were male. This proportion was not significantly different across control and seizure survey groups. Children in the control survey were significantly younger [9y 5m (SD 5y 11m)] than the children in the seizure survey [13y 4m (SD 6y 8m); t = 9.0, p < 0.0001]; this may relate to some individuals only developing seizures later in life.

Fifty-three respondents reported that the child had both clinical and subclinical seizures. These responses were included in both the clinical and subclinical seizure groups. This resulted in 548 responses about children with clinical seizures and 144 responses about children with subclinical seizures. Males made up 76% and 78% of the clinical seizures and subclinical seizure groups, respectively, with no significant difference in these proportions across groups. The average age of the child at the time the survey was 13y 5m (SD 7y 1m) and 12y 1m (SD 6y 6m) for children with clinical and subclinical seizures, respectively.

Subclinical seizure type and the interaction between seizure type and cluster were not significant. The effect of cluster was significant for all ratings, including the more specific ratings for communication and behavior (See Additional file 2, Table S6).

A survey that gathered information about children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) without seizures was also used to gather control data. The surveys were advertized on autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related websites. Both traditional treatments for seizures and non-traditional autism spectrum disorder (ASD) treatments were considered and the perceived effectiveness of these treatments on seizures, sleep, communication, behavior, attention and mood was queried. The perceived effectiveness of treatments was analyzed for individuals with clinical and subclinical seizures separately.",c6b72d7f-e016-43f4-958c-27ca30ed0565
75,discussion1," One of the most important findings of this study was that certain antiepileptic drug (AED) and non-antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments were perceived as improving seizures while also improving, or at least not worsening, other clinical factors that are important in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We will address specific aspects of this study's findings in separate sections below.  Characteristics of Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Seizures The proportion of male children in both the seizures and control survey was exactly the same, 77%, and consistent with other reports of the portion of males in the general autism spectrum disorder (ASD) population [19]. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and both clinical and subclinical seizures were more likely to have a diagnosis of Autism Disorder, and less likely to have a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, than the control children.",d31e9859-09e8-4086-a97a-2519480f3e4d
76,discussion2," Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and clinical seizures, but not subclinical seizures, were more likely to have mental retardation than control children but other medical conditions were not different between the seizure and control groups. This suggests that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and clinical seizures have more severe cognitive difficulties as compared to children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) without seizure, consistent with previous studies [20-22]. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and both clinical and subclinical seizures are more likely to have regression as compared to control children, consistent with previous studies [23]. It is important to point out that despite the higher rate of regression in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and either clinical or subclinical seizures, the majority of such children in these groups did not have regression.",d88059ad-ab9c-4382-a0c8-9f60d80476d9
77,discussion3," Thus, it is important to approach children with both regressive and non-regressive autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with a similar index of suspicion when considering a workup for seizures.  Management and Diagnosis of Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Seizures Overall, for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in general, pediatricians managed medical and developmental issues. A child neurologist managed the medical and developmental issues of the majority of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and either clinical and/or subclinical seizures. The medical and developmental aspects of the child were managed, in part, by a doctor affiliated with Defeat Autism Now! in approximately one-third of children overall. It is clear from this data that multiple practitioners, in general, manage children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), presumably due to the complexity of this disorder.  The great majority of children (i.e.",80d68647-be9c-4efe-a990-14eea81ea331
78,discussion4,", > 88%) with clinical and subclinical seizures were diagnosed and managed, at least in part, by a child or adult neurologist. This is an encouraging finding, but it is important for all children with any type of seizure activity to be managed by an expert in seizures such as a neurologist or epileptologist. Over half of the control children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were never evaluated for seizures. Our recent study on subclinical discharges demonstrated that many of the children with such discharges have no specific symptoms except for delays in language development and features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention deficit [24]. Thus, it is important to keep a high index of suspicion for seizures, especially subclinical seizures, in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) since the symptoms of subclinical seizures can be subtle [24].",401abec0-830b-4e84-8d82-fcb64ae0ba05
79,discussion5," In addition, partial complex seizures, especially that originate in the temporal or frontal lobes can present as complex behaviors and automatisms that may be difficult to differentiate autism spectrum disorder (ASD) behaviors [25-30]. This may be true especially in non-verbal and/or non-communicative children who cannot express symptoms and in whom paradoxical symptoms, such as speech arrest, cannot be easily observed.  The majority of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and seizures underwent a routine epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalograph (EEG) as a diagnostic test for their clinical and/or subclinical seizure disorder while significantly fewer children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and clinical seizures had an overnight and ambulatory epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalograph (EEG) as compared to children with subclinical seizures.",a6a9600b-d867-4f6c-a88b-6cd45b6e918d
80,discussion6," Of course, many of the subclinical seizure disorders require an overnight epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalograph (EEG) to diagnose, so this is not unexpected. Of the children with clinical and subclinical seizures, 17% and 10% of them did not have any diagnostic test for diagnosis, respectively. This is concerning, especially for subclinical seizures, since autism spectrum disorder (ASD) behaviors, especially staring, can be mistaken for subtle seizure activity.  Treatments for Clinical Seizures One of the most important findings of this study was that antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments, as compared to non-antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments, were perceived by parents as improving seizures but, as a group, they were perceived as worsening other clinical factor (i.e., sleep, communication, behavior, attention and mood) for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and clinical seizures.",60661714-5293-4da7-bcb7-e715110ec2ec
81,discussion7," However, four antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments (valproic acid, lamotrigine, levetiracetam and ethosuximide) were perceived by parents to improve seizures and not worsen other clinical factors. Clearly antiepileptic drug (AED)s are important for treating clinical seizures in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but do not appear to be rated as helpful for treating other comorbid clinical factors associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) such as communication, behavior and mood. It is somewhat surprising that antiepileptic drug (AED)s such as valproic acid and lamotrigine were not perceived to have a more positive effect on mood as both of these medications are considered mood stabilizers [6].  Interestingly, most antiepileptic drug (AED) and non-antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments examined were perceived to improve seizures or other clinical factors, but not both.",3ea724b9-5bfb-4f5e-bbe4-7fdc8a111a00
82,discussion8," The exception were four non-antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments (ketogenic diet, Atkin's or modified Atkin's diet, gluten free casein free diet and hyperbaric oxygen therapy), which were perceived to improve both seizures and other clinical factors. autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been suggested to be associated with cortical hyperexcitability [5]. antiepileptic drug (AED)s exert their effect by reducing cortical excitability [31]. The fact that some of the key symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (i.e., communication and behavior) are perceived to be improved by reducing cortical hyperexcitability suggests that the cortical hyperexcitability associated with seizures is not a major part of the neuropathology leading to the cognitive features associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), at least in the subgroup of children with clinical seizures.",2232a307-7fa3-4980-8c5c-e8ffd90e2c5f
83,discussion9," Interestingly, although the cortical hyperexcitability associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been attributed to an inhibitory deficit [5], many of the antiepileptic drug (AED)s thought to target inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid mechanisms were not the ones perceived to be most effective in this population.  Many parents reported using non-antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments for their children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and seizures. Interestingly, several non-antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments were perceived as efficacious in treating both seizures and other clinical factors. One treatment, the ketogenic diet, was perceived as very effective for improving seizures as compared to other antiepileptic drug (AED) and non-antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments and was perceived as having favorable effects on sleep, communication, behavior, attention and mood.",9b884b58-f87b-4aa2-ba7c-f38185f5fc5e
84,discussion10," The ketogenic diet is well known to be effective in drug resistant epilepsy [32] and has been reported to be effective in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [33]. The effectiveness of the ketogenic diet for the treatment of both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and seizures could be through several mechanisms. The ketogenic diet has been shown to be effective for improving mitochondrial function [34] and oxidative stress [35], two biological mechanisms believed to underlie the neuropathology associated with both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [11,36,37] and seizures [13]. The rate of adverse effects, especially for multiple adverse effects, was lower for ketogenic diet as compared to the antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments and the specific adverse effect profile was different with lower rates of adverse behavior or mood as compared to antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments.",4fbeb89f-ab6f-4900-8614-96a045a527c7
85,discussion11," The Atkin's or modified Atkin's diet which, like the ketogenic diet, promotes ketosis and limits carbohydrate metabolism, was also perceived as effective at improving seizures with a favorable adverse effect profile and has been reported to have similar effectiveness at treating epilepsy as the ketogenic diet [32]. Of course the ketogenic diet, as well as any dietary treatment, can result in adverse effects, such as severe acidosis, which might dangerous in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), particularly those with metabolic conditions such as mitochondrial disorders. Thus, the ketogenic diet as well as other therapies should be managed by a practitioner with considerable experience with such therapies. Clearly these treatments require further study in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and seizures.",0b9db745-e92c-47f1-8bbd-42ef0b544218
86,discussion12,"  Treatments for Subclinical Seizures For the subclinical seizure group, antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments were not perceived to significantly improve cognitive and behavioral factors related to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This was somewhat of a surprise as some of the antiepileptic drug (AED)s reported to be used in this group have been associated with improvement in language, attention and behavior in some children with subclinical seizures, particularly those with Landau-Kleffner syndrome [38] and subclinical epileptiform discharges [24]. The ketogenic diet and steroids were in the non-antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment cluster that was rated as showing improvement in communication and behavior, thereby verifying previous studies [38,39].",de823502-94ff-4cd3-8cfa-2345431b4cef
87,discussion13," Overall, the ketogenic diet and steroids were perceived as having a similar benefit as compared to several other non-antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments (see Table 8 and Figure 3), but the perceived improvement attributed to treatments within this cluster, on average, was not particularly high. This is consistent with the very variable effectiveness of treatments for subclinical epileptiform discharges [38]. Most likely, a more detailed approach to analyzing this group of patients by, perhaps, examining individual patient-to-patient variability, will provide more information regarding which patients respond to treatment. A larger number of respondents would also assist in providing more accurate information.  Limitations This study was designed to obtain general parental impressions regarding the effectiveness of seizure specific treatments and general alternative autism spectrum disorder (ASD) treatments on seizures and other clinical factors.",7c8cce0b-0fcf-460b-bec0-3702fb8579e5
88,discussion14," In this study we consider each treatment in isolation as if it was given in a controlled manner and any resulting effects could be directly related to the treatment. However, many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are prescribed multiple treatments and many families initiate and/or discontinue treatments without advice from the practitioner that is managing their child. Despite this limitation, some clear perceived differences between treatments were evident in this survey.  It should be mentioned that the relation to the individual being reported was not queried, so it is possible that other caretakers of a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could have completed the survey instead of the parents. The information obtained was only the perception of the parents and was not documented by trained professionals. This may have limited the validity of the information in several ways.",aff7f4ea-3ae7-4379-b291-2e5606714546
89,discussion15," First, instruments used to diagnose autism spectrum disorder (ASD) vary from clinic-to-clinic and it is possible that the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis was not made using any standardized tool since we did not verify the diagnosis. However, the overwhelming majority of parents reported that either a child or adult neurologist managed their autism spectrum disorder (ASD) child if they had clinical seizures, subclinical epileptiform discharges or seizure-like activity and the majority of the parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who completed the control survey reported that the a pediatrician or psychiatrist managed their child's health and development. Thus, the parents who responded to this survey had adequate professional advice on which to base their report.  This study is subject several other limitations including potential bias of the responders.",efdc8861-ae1e-4dd1-a1ff-3fc823cc1448
90,discussion16," Most concerning is that individuals who tend to use non-traditional therapies may be critical of traditional drug treatments due to adverse effects [10]. So, relative rankings of one antiepileptic drug (AED) vs. another may be reasonable, but the effectiveness of antiepileptic drug (AED)s may be somewhat under-reported relative to non-antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments. In addition, since medical information was obtained from parents, not medical records, this information could contain inaccuracies. Furthermore, the diagnosis of the subclinical seizures types can be very variable from practitioner-to-practitioner and some individuals may be told that an epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalograph (EEG) is normal if it contains paroxysmal discharges that are considered to be not clinically significant by the practitioner.",f381a8c3-7a10-49ae-a47b-188059e360e4
91,discussion17," Despite these limitations, the information gained from this survey provides important insight into which treatments should be further evaluated for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and clinical seizures.  Only 6% of children, overall, were reported to have genetic conditions, which is at the lower end of some estimates of the number of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who have genetic conditions [40]. This suggests that we may have under sampled this subgroup of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  Conclusions Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) report that antiepileptic drug (AED)s improve seizure control but worsen other clinical factors in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and clinical seizures.",6d43710d-757b-425f-a77c-a65d4a1e2775
92,discussion18," Particular antiepileptic drug (AED)s, including valproic acid, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, are reported to provide the best seizure control and worsen sleep, communication, behavior, attention and mood the least out of all of the antiepileptic drug (AED)s in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and clinical seizures. In individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and clinical seizures, non-antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments, in general, were reported to improve sleep, communication, behavior, attention and mood but improve seizures significantly less than antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments. Particular non-antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments, such as the ketogenic diet, were perceived to improve both seizures and other cognitive and behavioral factors in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and clinical seizures.",e0a15266-0889-4445-8d03-a645bb202630
