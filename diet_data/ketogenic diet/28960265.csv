0,introduction0,"Obesity has become one of the major public health concerns of the past decades, being a key risk factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and certain types of cancer, thereby leading to an increased mortality. Whereas the treatment for obesity and the prevention of obesity-related diseases are not always successful, a subgroup of obese individuals is at low risk for metabolic complications. “Metabolically healthy obesity (MHO)” represents such a subgroup of obese individuals who exhibit excessive accumulation of adipose tissue without adverse metabolic effects, including insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia1.",d3779f08-21d6-4ccc-9b07-9a98a054151e
1,introduction1," MHO individuals are characterized by increased fat storage capacity of adipose tissue with anti-inflammatory phenotype, and decreased ectopic fat deposition in the liver and skeletal muscle; these morphological and functional changes in adipose tissue consequently inhibit the development of insulin resistance and cardiometabolic diseases.  Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are oral antidiabetic drugs that promote the urinary excretion of glucose by blocking its reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules. We previously reported that the SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin (Ipra) promotes the expansion of epididymal adipose tissue (Epi) without deteriorating systemic glucose/lipid metabolism and adipose inflammation in obese mice2,3. This state of increased fat mass with a preserved metabolic fitness has been referred to as “healthy adipose tissue expansion”, which is similar to the adipose tissue found in MHO individuals.",640f5ea1-16a7-44e3-8603-ea2de1c66845
2,introduction2,"  A couple of studies with adipocyte-specific transgenic mouse models propose adipocyte-autonomous mechanisms to be responsible for healthy adipose tissue expansion; overexpression of adiponectin4 or the mitochondrial protein mitoNEET5, and ablation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)6 exhibit severe adiposity without detrimental effects of high-fat diet (high fat diet (HFD)) or ob/ob mutation on glucose and lipid metabolism. Besides mature adipocytes, the adipose tissue is composed of various stromal cells, such as preadipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells, which change dramatically in number and cell type during the course of obesity7,8. Particularly among stromal cells, macrophage infiltration in obese adipose tissue is reported to precede the development of adipocyte hypertrophy9, suggesting that adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) could regulate adipose expansion, inflammation, and systemic metabolism.",4512125a-9628-4562-9176-0b8401ab91f6
3,introduction3," ATMs are composed of at least two different phenotypes: classically activated M1-like macrophages and alternatively activated M2-like macrophages. M1-like ATMs produce proinflammatory cytokines, thus contributing to the induction of insulin resistance. In contrast, M2-like ATMs, which are the major phenotypes of ATMs in lean adipose tissue, mediate anti-inflammatory responses. Although these ATMs reportedly play several roles in the maintenance or improvement of systemic insulin sensitivity through inflammation of adipose tissue10–12, the stromal cell-mediated regulation of adipose expansion has not yet been fully understood.  In this study, we demonstrated that Ipra promoted the healthy adipose tissue expansion associated with a reduced M1-like/M2-like ratio of ATMs.",1404d8d8-e247-4627-914b-3b71c80d41e7
4,introduction4," Our observation implied that the change of M1-like/M2-like ratio of ATMs could cause adipocytes to induce healthy adipose tissue expansion during SGLT2 inhibition, and more broadly, it may offer new insights into the mechanisms of adipose expansion that could be therapeutic targets for obesity-associated metabolic comorbidities.

28,results12,"    Ketone body attenuates Il15 upregulation in M1-polarized macrophages We explored the molecular mechanism of ATM-mediated healthy adipose tissue expansion during SGLT2 inhibition, in terms of the functional interaction between ATMs and adipocytes. Based on microarray data in Epi from Ipra-treated mice (Supplementary Table 1), we focused on IL-15 (Il15) as a potential negative regulator of healthy adipose tissue expansion. Quantitative real-time RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis confirmed that Ipra significantly decreased Il15 expression in Epi of high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice (Fig. 4a). To narrow down the cellular source of IL-15 in adipose tissue, we separated Epi into adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Although Ipra did not affect Il15 expression in the adipocyte fraction (Supplementary Figure 5a), it significantly decreased Il15 expression in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) (Fig. 4b).",77fc327c-5fda-4586-8c9c-05a4565abdea

The localization of IL-15-positive cells appears to be similar to crown like structures (CLS), suggesting that the main cellular source of IL-15 in adipose tissue can be macrophages. In primary cultures of peritoneal macrophages from WT mice, LPS-induced M1 polarization significantly induced Il15 expression along with other inflammatory genes (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Figure 5c). In contrast, IL-4- or IL-13-induced M2 polarization significantly inhibited Il15 expression (Supplementary Figure 5d).Figure 4 Effects of IL-15 on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells.",b1c320cd-bce4-4e1f-be3b-47968979a542

With regard to a possible factor that inhibits Il15 expression in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells during Ipra treatment, we focused on ketone body BHB, whose serum concentration is increased in Ipra-treated mice2. BHB significantly attenuated Il15 induction in M1-polarized peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 4d), without affecting Il1b, Il6, or Tnfa induction in M1-polarized peritoneal macrophages (Supplementary Figure 5c).

32,results16,"  IL-15 inhibits lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells with Pck1 downregulation Consistent with a previous report14, recombinant IL-15 dose-dependently inhibited lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 4f), in association with a reduced expression of lipogenic genes, such as Pck1, Fasn, and Scd1 (Fig. 4g). Among these lipogenic genes, Pck1, which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1 which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)), has been reported to mediate glyceroneogenesis in adipocytes, thus promoting TG accumulation by fatty acid re-esterification. Increased fatty acid re-esterification by Pck1 which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) overexpression in adipose tissue has been reported to lead to adipose expansion without insulin resistance20, suggesting that Pck1 which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)-dependent TG accumulation could contribute to healthy adipose expansion.",d2708cd8-2e22-4a2b-8780-c34845e97453
33,results17," In adipocytes from Epi of Ipra-treated mice, Pck1 expression was significantly increased relative to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4h). A similar result was obtained in Epi from the CCR2 KO mice treated by Ipra (Supplementary Figure 5e). In contrast, Pck1 expression was decreased in Epi of high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice compared with SD-fed mice (Supplementary Figure 5f).  Ipra alters ceramide and sphingomyelin subspecies in adipose tissue of high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice We performed lipidomics profiling of Epi to assess whether the healthy adipose expansion accompanied altered lipid profiles including individual lipid classes. Ipra treatment decreased ceramide (ceramide (CER)) [FA24:1] and sphingomyelin (SM) [FA24:1], and increased SM [FA18:0] in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice (Supplementary Figure 6a). CCR2 deficiency in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice during Ipra treatment also had similar effects on ceramide (CER) and SM subspecies in Epi (Supplementary Figure 6b).",95c6a495-a420-48e5-91ae-01b63a9f87af
34,results18," Ipra had little effect on di- and triacylglycerol, or free-fatty acid subspecies in Epi of high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice (data not shown).  Ketogenic diet phenocopies adipose tissue expansion in Ipra-treated mice We finally examined whether ketone bodies could cause adipose expansion without deteriorating systemic glucose metabolism in vivo, and whether it accompanies a decreased Il15 as observed in cultured M1-polarized peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 4d). Eight-week-old male WT mice were fed a ketogenic diet for 4 weeks; after 2 weeks of the ketogenic diet, serum BHB levels were significantly increased as compared with the control diet (Fig. 5a). The ketogenic diet did not change the body weight in WT mice as compared to those fed the control diet (Fig. 5b).

36,discussion0,"The healthy adipose tissue expansion of Ipra-treated high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice reported in our previous2 and the present studies are partly explained by a cell-autonomous mechanism demonstrated in a previous report; adipocyte-specific PTEN-knockout mice, which exhibit enhanced insulin signaling in adipocytes, gained more weight and adiposity during high fat diet (HFD) feeding6. The mice showed enhanced insulin sensitivity, improved hepatic steatosis, and reduced adipose tissue inflammation, which were consistent with this study. Therefore, we consider that the enhanced adipocyte insulin signaling by Ipra, probably via improving hyperinsulinemia, results in increased lipid-storage capacity in adipocytes. Since it has been reported that hyperglycemia also causes insulin resistance and inflammation in adipocyte with oxidative stress-dependent manner21, reducing hyperglycemia by Ipra could additionally contribute to improve insulin resistance and inflammation in adipocytes.",94c12a34-3498-489c-bd2c-5219ded806ac
37,discussion1," In addition to such an adipocyte-autonomous mechanism, the data of this study indicate a novel ATM-mediated mechanism for healthy adipose tissue expansion during SGLT2 inhibition, and this study may also reveal the role of ATMs in the regulation of energy storage through fat accumulation. Clinically, the involvement of ATMs in the development of adipose tissue may be possibly observed in MHO subjects. Similarly, their potential as a therapeutic target of obesity-associated metabolic comorbidities through the induction of healthy adipose tissue expansion can be explored.  Considered from previous papers reporting the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on body weight and adiposity vary across the studies; treatment with tofogliflozin suppressed high fat diet (HFD)-induced body weight gain as well as the progression of hepatic steatosis, when it is administered for 20 weeks beginning at the start of high fat diet (HFD) feeding22.",8f46f72c-3f37-4516-be60-a01bb507ea3e
38,discussion2," In contrast, 4-week treatment with remogliflozin following 11-week of high fat diet (HFD) feeding attenuated hepatic steatosis without changing body weight gain23. Other report has shown that luseogliflozin decreased liver weight and serum aminotransferase (ALT) levels in STZ-treated mice fed a high fat diet (HFD), without affecting body weight gain24. Taken together, although the precise mechanisms remain unknown, these observations suggest that the study protocol, especially in the timing of administration of SGLT2 inhibitors during high fat diet (HFD) feeding and a mouse model, could affect body weight gain in mice.  As well as rodent, a human study has demonstrated that the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin elicited an adaptive increase of energy intake in patients with type 2 diabetes, which caused substantially less weight loss than that expected from the energy dissipated because of glycosuria25.",f181c812-27ab-4e6a-a917-14e99b5cb46f
39,discussion3," It suggests that inhibition of SGLT2 basically causes similar biological responses of appetite and energy intake in human and mice. Although previous human studies26–28 have consistently shown that treatment of SGLT2 inhibitors reduces body weight as average, our previous data has demonstrated that approximately 20% of patients treated with Ipra did not achieve more than 1% of body weight reduction2. While studies in humans predominantly describe weight loss with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on body weight and adiposity in murine studies has been variable.  Other anti-diabetic agents, such as thiazolidinedione10, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor29, and metformin30 have been reported to have direct effects on ATMs by the induction of an M2-dominant shift.",f872b049-1380-4ce6-bf7f-6c9605373272
40,discussion4," However, considering the low expression levels of Slc5a2 in macrophages, adipocytes, stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells and adipose tissue, Ipra is unlikely to have the direct effects on such cells or on a tissue. In the context of obesity-associated metabolic comorbidities, hyperglycemia has been shown to interfere with IL-4 action to M2-like polarization in macrophages as assessed by the decreased expression of M2-related genes and the reduced functional activity of arginase31. Therefore, the improvement of hyperglycemia could be considered as one of the mechanisms for changing M1-like/M2-like ratio of ATMs in Ipra-treated mice.  The pharmacological blockade of CSF-1 receptor signaling by GW2580 decreased M2-related genes in Epi of Ipra-treated mice; however, it did not affect adipose mass or glucose metabolism.",7890b488-e7f8-44de-818c-d3123286ba50
41,discussion5," In contrast, decrease of both M1- and M2-like ATMs in Epi of Ipra-treated CCR2 KO mice more strongly enhanced adipose tissue expansion without deteriorating glucose intolerance, than those of only Ipra-treated WT mice. Some previous reports have shown that M2-like macrophages promote adipose tissue expansion in mice; deficiency of Trib1, an adaptor protein involved in protein degradation by interacting with an ubiquitin ligase, diminishes adipose tissue mass accompanied with a reduction of M2-like ATMs32. A recent report has shown that CD206-positive cells are primarily M2-like macrophages, and that ablation of CD206-positive M2-like macrophages improves systemic insulin sensitivity with an increased number of smaller adipocytes33. Although the exact reason of the discrepancies of phenotypes between these previous studies and ours remains unclear, we assume that it might be due to the methodology for reduction of M2-like ATMs.",7aa93ff7-716c-47d8-b659-d40d6b0f24b5
42,discussion6," In the present study, we used CSF-1 receptor kinase inhibitor GW2580 to reduce M2-like ATMs. Although the phenotypes of GW2580-treated mice were inconsistent with those of Trib1-defecient and CD206-positive cells-depleted mice, they were consistent with phenotypes of op/+ mice, which carry an inactivating heterozygous mutation in the CSF-1 gene34; high fat diet (HFD)-fed op/+ mice showed no change in adiposity, glucose tolerance, or adipose inflammation compared to high fat diet (HFD)-fed wild-type mice. Although these genetic or pharmacological approaches successfully reduced M2-like ATMs assessed as representative marker genes and/or surface antigens, the reduced cell population might not be identical, possibly leading to the differential effects on adiposity.  Among M1-related genes in adipose tissue altered by Ipra treatment, Il15 is significantly downregulated in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of Ipra-treated mice.",a8059efe-84c8-4433-95c5-2dd7d5196a16
43,discussion7," Consistent with a previous report35, immunostaining for IL-15 in Epi suggests that ATMs are assumed to be the cellular source of IL-15 in stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Il15 ablation in mice has been reported to result in a significant increased weight gain independent of appetite; notably, the mice do not display obesity-associated inflammation, characterized as an increase of serum IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α concentrations36. In addition, consistent with our observation, treatment of differentiated human adipocytes with recombinant IL-15 resulted in decreased lipid deposition, indicating its direct inhibitory effect on adipogenesis14. Although the pathological relevance of IL-15 in the healthy adipose tissue expansion requires further studies, the Ipra-induced downregulation of Il15 in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells, possibly in ATMs, seems to promote adipocyte expansion in a paracrine manner.",04bd384c-5639-4cae-938e-b10c7430e623
44,discussion8,"  In addition to the reduced M1-like/M2-like ratio of ATMs, we consider that ketone bodies contribute to Il15 downregulation in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells of adipose tissue from Ipra-treated mice. We previously showed that 4 weeks of Ipra treatment significantly increased serum BHB concentrations in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice2. As well as the high fat diet (HFD)-fed WT mice2, BHB concentrations and the adipose tissue expansion during SGLT2 inhibition were changed in parallel also in GW2580-treated and CCR2 KO mice; both BHB concentration and adipocyte size were increased in CCR2 KO mice, but neither of them were increased in GW2580-treated mice. BHB has been shown to increase global histone acetylation by inhibiting class I histone deacetylases (histone deacetylases (HDAC)) in mouse tissues37.",f922367b-9ab3-47d1-a7b4-442f140ef9dc
45,discussion9," Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDAC) by BHB was correlated with global changes in transcription of the genes encoding oxidative stress resistance factors; BHB treatment consequently protected mice from oxidative stress. Furthermore, BHB is also demonstrated to abolish inflammatory responses in human macrophages by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome38. Taken together, it is conceivable that the BHB-induced inhibition of Il15 in M1 macrophages may be mediated at least partly by attenuation of oxidative stress and/or NLRP3 inflammasome. Given that BHB did not suppress the elevation of Tnfa and Il6 in M1-skewed macrophages, the inhibitory effect of BHB on the induction of M1-related genes seems to be gene-selective. The precise molecular mechanisms by which BHB modulates inflammatory responses in macrophages need further studies.",fe7fbaca-5149-45e7-af1b-a718ceb8cd6e
46,discussion10,"  Since adipose tissue conditioned medium from Ipra-treated high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice increased Mrc1 and Mgl2 expression in peritoneal macrophages compared with vehicle-treated high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, adipose tissue-derived substances, as well as ketone body, are considered as possible distinct and unique factors to induce Ipra-induced functional modulation of ATMs. Various signaling molecules released from dying cells are known to act as chemoattractants and affect immune responses39–41. In adipose tissues, we previously showed that macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle), a pathogen sensor for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is localized to ATMs constituting crown like structures (CLS) and activated by an endogenous ligand released from dying adipocytes42.",e368b4a7-2883-478c-b4ba-7c6bd17d3718
47,discussion11," Mincle activation induces inflammatory responses and extracellular matrix production in macrophages, which may deteriorate adipose tissue inflammation and limit high fat diet (HFD)-induced hypertrophy of adipocytes to inhibit ectopic lipid accumulation. Therefore, substances from dying and/or dead adipocytes have been also proposed to locally affect ATMs’ characters, and reduced adipocyte death induced by Ipra may affect the phenotypes of ATMs.  Because Pck1 upregulation in adipose tissue and adipocytes is commonly observed in high fat diet (HFD)-fed WT mice treated with Ipra, CCR2 KO mice and ketogenic diet-fed mice, adipose Pck1 may play a key role in the induction of healthy adipose expansion. In addition, IL-15 inhibited lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells with downregulation of Pck1, suggesting IL-15 to be an exogenous factor, possibly produced from ATMs in vivo, to suppress lipogenesis.",57ee45f6-cd8a-41e0-959d-ba7858eb11c2
48,discussion12," Adipocyte Pck1 which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is known to mediate glyceroneogenesis, which synthesizes glycerol-3-phosphate or TG from precursors other than glucose. Some reports proposed that Pck1 which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)-mediated glyceroneogenesis plays a critical role in the development of healthy adipose tissue expansion; aP2-driven Pck1 which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) overexpression increases adipose mass with enhanced fatty acid re-esterification and without worsening systemic glucose metabolism20. Mice carrying the mutated binding site of PPARγ in the promoter region of a cytosolic Pck1 which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (Pck1 which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)-C) gene, which consequently abolishes Pck1 which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)-C gene expression in adipose tissue, exhibit reduced TG deposition in Epi43.",dcfe99ed-37bf-4373-9c28-c37faeda5120
49,discussion13," Considering that adipose tissue expansion by high fat diet (HFD) feeding conversely suppressed Pck1 expression, adipose Pck1 and Pck1 which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)-mediated glyceroneogenesis may be a possible determinant factor in healthy adipose tissue expansion. The pathophysiological significance and detailed molecular mechanisms of Pck1 which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)-mediated glyceroneogenesis in the healthy adipose tissue expansion and the involvement of the ATMs-derived IL-15 in adipocyte Pck1 regulation require further studies.  Along with the possible alternation of the lipid synthesis pathway toward Pck1 which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)-mediated glyceroneogenesis, Ipra treatment also affected profiles of ceramide (CER) and SM subspecies in Epi of high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice.",9d32bc33-076c-4302-9555-51c3b348ab0f
50,discussion14," ceramide (CER) and SM, which are included as part of sphingolipids, have been demonstrated to play a substantial role in the development of a variety of diseases as important bioactive mediators. In adipose tissue, adipocyte-specific ablation of SPTLC2, a subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase that is an initial enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis, has been reported to increase ceramide (CER)[C24:1] content in adipose tissue of high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, and reduce adipose tissue mass with marked Pck1 downregulation44. In addition, the adipocyte-specific SPTLC2-knockout mice also accompanied hepatic steatosis, implying a mirror image phenotype of lipid deposition and content as the Ipra-treated mice in our study.",581236c8-0f7b-4c5c-a7b2-a753a69dc086
51,discussion15," Since CCR2 deficiency in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice during Ipra treatment and ketogenic diet also increased ceramide (CER)[C24:1] in Epi, the healthy adipose expansion, at least observed in these conditions, could be mediated by alternation of the ceramide (CER) subspecies. Although the link between Pck1 which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)-mediated glyceroneogenesis and sphingolipid biosynthesis, and precise role of sphingolipid in the healthy adipose expansion remain unclear, alternation of lipid synthesis and subspecies may be involved in the development of the healthy adipose expansion.  In conclusion, this study revealed the ATM-mediated mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibition promoted healthy adipose expansion. Furthermore, ATMs are proposed to be potential therapeutic targets for obesity-associated metabolic comorbidities via the changes they induce in the characteristics of adipose tissue.",e44f9627-f2e9-45ee-b469-ce7488e75efc
