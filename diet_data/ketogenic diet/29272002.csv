1,methods0,"2.1 Patient selection This is a retrospective study involving 25 patients with established diagnosis of gene (GLUT)1DS, aged 3.7–40 years (mean 13.16), composed of seven males and 18 females. All patients were regularly followed up at Fondazione Istituto Neurologico Nazionale C. Mondino (Pavia, Italy) between 2007 and 2016. Informed consent was obtained from children's parents and patients. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our Institute.  For each patient included in the study, information such as type of gene (GLUT)1 mutation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/blood glucose ratio, type of seizure, type of movement disorder, intelligence quotient (IQ) [total (type of movement disorder intelligence quotient (IQ) [total (TIQ)), verbal (verbal (VIQ)), and performance (Performance Intelligence Quotient (PIQ))], and response to the KD were collected.",c7c06b9a-392b-4ba2-9d14-26b12846ffe9
2,methods1," Classical KD was given in 4:1, 3:1, or 2:1 ratio (grams of fat: carbohydrates plus proteins) in order to obtain beta‐hydroxybutyrate levels between 2 and 6 mmol/L in each patient.  2.2 Follow‐up evaluations Baseline (T0) evaluations, referring to the time of gene (GLUT)1DS diagnosis, were available for all 25 patients. Data were collected at specific time intervals while on KD: T1, mean of 18 months (range 11–28), available in 14 patients (five patients dropped out and six patients did not reach T1 follow‐up at the time of the study); T2, mean of 36 months (range 27–48), available in six patients at the time of the study.  2.3 Neuropsychological assessment Standard cognitive tests measured with Wechsler Intelligence Scales (Wechsler, 1995, 2012) according to the age of the patient were conducted at T0, T1, and T2. Test administration was carried out individually by a professional neuropsychologist. Testing was divided into two sessions; neither exceeded 45 min per subject per session.",2361aa2e-fd5f-4704-aa1c-257c9dc6fc82
3,methods2," Cognitive function was expressed as Total Intelligence Quotient (type of movement disorder intelligence quotient (IQ) [total (TIQ)), Verbal Intelligence Quotient (verbal (VIQ)), and Performance Intelligence Quotient (Performance Intelligence Quotient (PIQ)).  Each subtest was analyzed to a have a clinical picture of cognitive function and its domain.  2.4 Statistical analyses Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software version 19.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). After testing for normal distribution by mean of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, we applied nonparametric tests. Matched data were compared with Wilcoxon signed rank test, while differences between groups were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U‐test. Values were expressed as medians and ranges, while categorical variables were described as absolute numbers and percentages.  Correlation analysis was then used to identify potential influencing factors for IQ amelioration in the whole sample.",ebb6c062-7ee1-4916-b869-3e9c9b95a2dd
4,methods3," Nonparametric correlation coefficient (Spearman's Rho) was used, considering the presence of non‐normally distributed variables.  Clinical variables analyzed in relation to cognition were the presence and type of mutation (missense, nonsense, splice site, deletion, or frame shift), CSF/blood glucose ratio, and patient's age at the time of KD implementation.  2.5 Ethical statement We confirm that we have read the Journal's position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines.  3  In our retrospective study involving 25 patients with established gene (GLUT)1DS diagnosis, we describe the cognitive impairment of these patients in detail and their response to the ketogenic diet in terms of cognitive improvement.

The mean CSF/blood glucose ratio was 0.5 (range 0.34–0.73).  The majority of patients (22 of 25) were treated with classical KD (4:1, 3:1, or 2:1 fat to nonfat ratio) with an adequate compliance and no serious side effects reported. Diet was introduced at a mean age of 142 months (range 22–245 months). Epilepsy had a positive response to KD in 81% (17 of 21 are seizure free) and involuntary movements resolved in 84% (16 of 19).  Intelligence quotient scores measured by Wechsler Intelligence Scales were available in all patients at T0 (detailed description of results in Supplementary Table A).",6575b324-e589-487c-bbda-ef93bfb7c793

Meanwhile, patients with mild cognitive impairment presented at the opposite, having lower verbal (VIQ) scores than Performance Intelligence Quotient (PIQ) in 50% of the patients.  Dividing the subjects into four groups according to the type of movement disorder intelligence quotient (IQ) [total (TIQ), we found that discrepancy of >10 and >20 points was present uniformly in the all groups: (two in normal type of movement disorder intelligence quotient (IQ) [total (TIQ), two in borderline type of movement disorder intelligence quotient (IQ) [total (TIQ); one in the mild cognitive impairment, and three in the moderate cognitive impairment).",ec4add8e-58b2-48bd-a014-eb49593f8ad4

On the base of CSF/blood glucose ratio, we classified patients into three groups as “low ratio” group (>0.40), “moderately low ratio” group (0.36–0.39), and “severely low ratio” group (≤ 0.35). IQ (total, verbal and performance) evolution in relation to CSF/blood glucose ratio was as follows: in “severely low ratio” group type of movement disorder intelligence quotient (IQ) [total (TIQ) was substantially stationary with worsening of verbal (VIQ) and an improvement in Performance Intelligence Quotient (PIQ).",0ec46926-12ec-4d91-8a66-34376949fd1d

18,results14,"1224 ==== Body 1 INTRODUCTION Glucose Transporter Type I Deficiency Syndrome (gene (GLUT)1DS) is a metabolic disorder due to mutations in SLC2A1 gene (1p 31.3→35) (Shows et al., 1987) which encodes for a specific transporter of glucose in the brain. Ketogenic diet (KD), which provides ketone bodies instead of D‐glucose as alternative fuel for cerebral metabolism, is at current time the gold standard therapy for gene (GLUT)1DS (Klepper, 2008).  Since the first description of the disease by De Vivo et al.",bd0f17bc-2df2-4496-bd34-6710876c6fce
19,results15," (1991), different studies have led to identification of “common manifestations” of this disease (microcephaly, cognitive impairment, epilepsy, continuous movement disorders, and paroxysmal exercise‐induced dyskinesia) and “uncommon manifestations” (paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia [PKD], paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia [PNKD], oculogyric crises, and fatigue) that suggest a high probability of gene (GLUT)1DS as a clinical diagnosis (De Giorgis, Varesio, Baldassari, Olivotto, & Veggiotti, 2016).  Epilepsy occurs in about 90% of cases and seizure types vary widely as follows in order of frequency: generalized tonic‐clonic seizures (GTCs), absence, complex partial, myoclonic, drop attacks, tonic, simple partial, infantile spasms, and epileptic spasms (Pong et al., 2012). KD was proven to have an anticonvulsant property in many studies (Kass, Winesett, Bessone, Turner, & Kossoff, 2016; Leen et al., 2010; Pong et al., 2012; Ramm‐Pettersen et al.",0b15f0a8-d2da-4c3f-b4f2-ddd32d1aed0f
20,results16,", 2013) but the underlying mechanism is not completely understood (Clanton, Wu, Akabani, & Aramayo, 2017; Politi, Shemer‐Meiri, Shuper, & Aharoni, 2011).  In addition to seizures, involuntary movements are common symptoms of gene (GLUT)1DS (De Giorgis et al., 2016) which also demonstrated a positive response to KD, (Leen et al., 2010; Veggiotti et al., 2010), even if improvement was less evident compared to the effect on seizures.  Regarding cognitive impairment in gene (GLUT)1DS patients, several reports describe a mild or moderate‐severe mental disability (without a clear definition of degree), in most cases proportional to disease's severity (Hully et al., 2015; Larsen et al., 2015; Leen et al., 2010; Tzadok et al., 2014) (for an overview of literature see Table 1). Hully et al. (2015) observed that patients with myoclonic seizures have a higher likelihood of cognitive impairment. Ito et al.",cdf9b80d-aed0-4847-bff9-3d36caeab6d7
21,results17," (2015) found that mental disability was more severe in patients with earlier disease onset; furthermore, they found a better cognitive outcome in patients with missense mutations, higher CSF/blood glucose ratio, and a later age of disease onset.

Efficacy of KD on cognitive functions has been poorly investigated so far, even if an improvement was reported in terms of visuomotor precision (3/6 patients in Ramm‐Pettersen, Stabell, Nakken, & Selmer 2014), alertness/vigilance, and motivation (6/6 patients in Ito, Oguni, Ito, Oguni, & Osawa 2011; 5/13 patients in De Giorgis et al. 2015), IQ performance (2/6 patients in Ramm‐Pettersen et al.",bef4710d-2e6e-4fbb-9c70-d7756bfbb666

Total IQ improvement was found in 1/13 patients in an Italian group (De Giorgis et al., 2015) and in 4/6 patients in a Japanese population (Ito et al., 2011). Younger patients demonstrated the most noteworthy response on KD (Ramm‐Pettersen et al., 2013).  Duration of KD was also mentioned to have an impact on cognition, particularly with an improvement of type of movement disorder intelligence quotient (IQ) [total (TIQ). In Ramm‐Pettersen et al. 2014 after 14 months of KD, a patient gained 21 points of type of movement disorder intelligence quotient (IQ) [total (TIQ) from 42 to 63 on Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI III) (Wechsler, 2008); a patient in De Giorgis et al.",83746da3-40de-45da-b6fd-d74990329c67
26,results23," 2015, after 2 years of diet, gained 10 points of type of movement disorder intelligence quotient (IQ) [total (TIQ) from 79 to 89 on WISC III. Besides these rare reports, the cognitive profile in gene (GLUT)1DS has not been deeply characterized so far. Effectiveness of the diet on cognition is probably difficult to assess because of the presence of other genetic and environmental factors that could be involved in the outcome.  The aim of our study was to describe the cognitive profile in gene (GLUT)1DS patients, before and after the KD introduction, in order to define a specific cognitive profile—in terms of trend of specific indexes of Wechsler Intelligence Scales (total, verbal, and non verbal) and individual subtests—to correlate it to gene (GLUT)1 phenotype and outcome after KD introduction.  2 ",3d12da81-63dc-4e2a-ac54-27727ea19890
27,discussion0," So far, most literature data focused on gene (GLUT)1DS general clinical profile in both pediatric and adult populations with predominantly qualitative description of cognitive function. The majority of reports try to correlate KD response with general outcome of al lgene (GLUT)1DS symptoms and describe cognitive and behavioral aspects when available.  Our experience clearly demonstrated a peculiar cognitive profile in gene (GLUT)1DS patients where performance IQ was more affected than verbal IQ. This result was prominent in patients with normal and borderline IQ, where a greater impairment in performance domain was found.  Analyzing each Wechsler Intelligence Scales (Wechsler, 1995, 2012) subtest, we identified a major impairment in performances such as Completion subtest, Coding‐Digit Symbol, Picture Arrangement, and Block design.",94838348-a565-4761-b170-9d771b4ff825
28,discussion1," Low scores in Picture Completion subtest reveals an impairment in attention capacity, ability to observe details, and recognize specific features of the environment. Low scores in Coding‐Digit Symbol imply an impairment in visual motor speed, motor coordination, memory, and visual analysis. Deficient scores in Picture Arrangement pertain to impairments in nonverbal reasoning, sequencing skills, temporospatial analysis, mental anticipation, planning capacity, speed, accuracy, and grasp of social cause and effect (also known as social intelligence). Lastly, deficient scores in Block Design reveal impairments in visual perceptual skills, speed, spatial problem‐solving, manipulative abilities, coordination, and fluid intelligence.",551367e7-260e-4d2f-aee2-3f4f53e4c15e
29,discussion2,"  Considering typical clinical profile of gene (GLUT)1DS patients with prominent extrapyramidal symptoms such as motor incoordination, dysarthria, fatigue, continuous and paroxystic movement disorders, we speculate that hindrance in performance skills could be considerably influenced by this symptomatology. Even if KD improved performance and writing skills (Veggiotti et al., 2010), the response to KD on involuntary movements was not excellent (patients #2 #5).  Taking into account IQ lower scores in subtests described above, we can speculate that gene (GLUT)1DS patients have a typical cognitive profile with greater difficulties in visuospatial and visuomotor skills. Therefore, according to this evidence, we suggest a complete neuropsychological investigation in order to provide a protocol that better defines nonverbal, visuomotor, speed and accuracy of gene (GLUT)1DS patients.",5e47eec7-53cb-4472-848c-d718a1a470c4
30,discussion3,"  In our study, we attempted to relate cognitive profile with clinical and genetic characteristics of gene (GLUT)1DS patients. We noticed that there is no direct correlation between type of mutation and cognitive impairment, as was noted by Ito et al. (2015); nor with type of movement disorder or type of seizure as observed by Hully et al. (2015).  On the other hand, we found a significant direct correlation between IQ (particularly type of movement disorder intelligence quotient (IQ) [total (TIQ) and verbal (VIQ)) and CSF/blood glucose ratio values in short‐term follow‐up (T1). Higher CSF/blood glucose ratio corresponded to a better cognitive improvement in response to KD measured at 18 months. This was clearly demonstrated by dividing our population into three groups according to their CSF/blood glucose ratio. In our sample, we observed a better cognitive outcome in patients with “low” and “moderately low” ratios compared to “severely low ratio” group.",e039742e-b0dd-4910-a996-c9f9841564d6
31,discussion4," The “severely low ratio” group obtained an improvement in cognition, but a longer duration of treatment was necessary (T2).  Considering these results, we can infer that a longer duration of KD treatment may be necessary to compensate greater CNS glucose transporter defect, especially in patients with severely low‐ratio values.  In a longitudinal study, Alter et al. (2015) found that patients treated early in infancy had a better long‐term outcome. This group hypothesized that there could be a “window of vulnerability” where an increase in cerebral glucose metabolism, not balanced because of typical energy deficit found in gene (GLUT)1DS, causes damage to the immature brain. They placed the vulnerability period between first and sixth months after birth, so they stated that diagnosis and treatment in this window are critical for improved neurological outcome.",6a2fb840-41ab-44a8-b0ac-99b0594d3304
32,discussion5,"  Although our population did not include patients with very early diagnosis and, thus, introduction of the KD in our sample was at an average age of 6 years, our results confirmed that the later the age of KD introduction, the worse the outcome of verbal (VIQ) in both short and medium term of the diet.  Those patients who started diet before 6 years of age achieved a better cognitive outcome; those who started between 6 and 12 years had a moderate decline of total IQ (with a stable verbal (VIQ) and worse Performance Intelligence Quotient (PIQ)). gene (GLUT)1DS patients who started KD in adolescence suffered the worst cognitive evolution.  Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that timing of KD introduction is a predictive factor for cognitive outcome in patients with gene (GLUT)1DS and that an earlier introduction of the diet may prevent not only epilepsy and movement disorder onset (previously widely demonstrated by different studies (Kass et al., 2016; Leen et al.",9221f263-84ba-415e-91e6-04060f513419
33,discussion6,", 2010; Pong et al., 2012; Ramm‐Pettersen et al., 2013; Veggiotti et al., 2010) but also cognitive impairment. Furthermore, on the basis of our experience, we can speculate that the “window of vulnerability” could be expanded in the early childhood as far as cognition is concerned.  Although duration of dietary therapy was not clearly stated in gene (GLUT)1DS therapeutic guidelines, physicians agree about obvious efficacy and good tolerability of KD on epilepsy and involuntary movements in the long term. So far, less data are available in literature about cognition, but studies available showed a better cognitive outcome in patients with earlier diagnosis and early introduction of KD (Ramm‐Pettersen et al., 2013).",46582937-8dba-493b-9e18-ef3a043f7944
34,discussion7," Our data confirm that an early KD introduction and a good compliance to the diet are predictive also of a better cognitive outcome, and our study confirms that prolonged treatment with KD is needed in order to increase the chance of achieving at least a partial recovery of neuropsychological deficits. Other possible environmental factors may have influenced the cognitive improvements described in our patients: family care, speech and other supportive therapies, KD ratio and compliance to the KD; probably KD with higher ratios could give a more rapid and effective response. In our experience, patients with drastic diets, carried out for a long period had higher noncompliance issues and dropouts.",7a7a4561-f1bd-4fb2-a562-02bf4c66c950
35,discussion8," For this reason, all our patients were prescribed a classical KD with variable ratios—but more frequently 3:1 or 2:1—with the aim of maintaining beta‐hydroxybutyrate levels between 2 and 6 mmol/L which have guaranteed the compliance to all of the patients recruited in our study and allowed a good efficacy response in terms of epilepsy, movement disorder, and cognition.  Considering that our results refer to a group of gene (GLUT)1DS patients with heterogeneous socio‐economic levels (parents’ education level, parents’ careers and salary, parents’ health) which influenced compliance to KD and cognitive outcome, it cannot be excluded that other environmental or unknown genetic factors could influence both initial cognitive competence and outcome after treatment. Definitely, other studies involving a larger population are needed to confirm our findings, characterize in more detail gene (GLUT)1DS patients’ cognitive profile and clearly assess response to KD therapy.",0683579a-ec66-4c8b-b073-c83a3605ec99
36,discussion9,"  Based on our cognitive results, we suggest applying to all gene (GLUT)1DS patients a complete neuropsychological investigation, studying in detail the visuospatial and visuomotor skills which were more compromised in our sample.  5 LIMITATIONS Future studies, which include a larger population, a longer follow‐up and higher statistical power, are necessary in order to obtain a better explanation of our results.  A relevant limitation of our study was the age of introduction of the KD conditioned by late diagnosis, so our data could not accurately outline the “window of vulnerability.”  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Prof. Veggiotti Pierangelo has received speaker's fee from Eisai and Nutricia.
