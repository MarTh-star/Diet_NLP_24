0,background0,"Dietary restriction, now usually referred to as caloric restriction, has been known about for decades and is a very robust intervention that produces a number of associated health benefits and ameliorates diseases with aging [1]. Fasting is defined as voluntary food deprivation that has been performed as religious observance for spiritual development and promotion of health among different people and religions worldwide [2]. Fasting have been used mainly for the treatment of obesity [3,4], and its therapeutic effects have also been reported to ameliorate hypertension [5], epilepsy [6], psychosomatic disease [7], and bronchial asthma [8]. However, the mechanisms for these benefits are still largely unknown.  During fasting, the body begins to break itself down to supply energy and dynamic metabolic changes occur [9,10].",918984ce-678d-4471-89fd-b7573740affe
1,background1," At the early stage of fasting, 1-2 days after food deprivation, hepatic glycogen and amino acids derived from muscle began to serve as the main source for glycogenesis for energy supply. After sources for hepatic glycogenesis storage have been depleted, 3 days to 1 week later, glycerol and fatty acids released from adipose tissues become the major source of energy production. Generated fatty acids are converted to acetyl-coA and are shunted to the ketogenic pathway resulting in the production of ketone bodies mainly in the liver. These ketones are transported to peripheral tissues where they can be converted back to acetyl CoA and utilized in the tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle for energy supplementation. In this condition, serum ketone body concentrations increases approximately 1000 fold from the normal state [11].  The beneficial pleiotropic effects of ketone bodies have been reported other than the role of metabolic fuel.",9b8e03d8-fe48-4f51-a239-fb9dfd05b0af
2,background2," D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB), a major circulating ketone body, has been demonstrated to be effective in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease in animal models and humans [12-14]. In addition, D-BHB has been found to attenuate corneal disorder [15,16], retinal degeneration [17], and bone loss from ovariectomy [18]. Recent finding also identified that D-BHB is an endogenous histone deacetylases inhibitor and helps cells resist oxidative stress [19]. These evidences raised the hypothesis that increased concentrations of ketone bodies may have a possible role in the health benefits obtained during food deprivation.  Several studies have shown that fasting enhances immunological defenses. Short-term fasting resulted in lower levels of antigen-specific IgE and attenuated pulmonary inflammation in a rat model of allergic responses to the house dust mite [20].",020b5dd3-a819-461a-958f-6915b5607a38

In the present study, we investigated effects of fasting on hypersensitivity using rat model of toluene 2 4 diisocyanate (TDI) induced nasal allergy. In addition, we also explored the possible role of D-BHB on the attenuation of immediate hypersensitivity by fasting. We showed that increases in serum D-BHB concentrations by fasting were strongly associated with suppression of immediate hypersensitivity and mast cell degranulation, which is known to initiate a hypersensitivity reaction [22].

31,discussion1," Therefore, to further investigate the relationship between D-BHB and allergic reactions, we focused on the effect of D-BHB on mast cell activation.  It has been reported that, the restriction of nutrition supplementation creates various enhancing effect on the cell mediated defense. To exclude the possible defense response by food deprivation other than increased D-BHB, we employed two methods to elevate internal D-BHB concentration in addition to fasting; a ketogenic high-fat, adequate-protein, and low-carbohydrate diet that accelerates fatty acid oxidation [32] and systemic instillation of D-BHB. Our results showed that, both treatments dramatically increased blood and intraperitoneal D-BHB concentrations similar to fasting and this was accompanied by inhibition of mast cell degranulation induced by compound 48/80 (Figure 5).",8de96923-25ee-4a62-9fbb-19ce3df3ab0b
32,discussion2," The inhibitory effect of mast cell degranulation by each treatment was diminished after D-BHB concentrations returned to a normal state by the interruption of each diet and D-BHB infusion. From these observations, we speculated that endogenous D-BHB which was dramatically increased by food deprivation, plays an important role in the attenuation of hypersensitivity symptoms through suppression of mast cell activation.  Increases in intracellular calcium activity are critical for the rapid exocytotic response of mast cells. The signaling pathway leading to exocytosis of mast cells has been well characterized [33]. Interestingly, mast cells delivered from 24 hours of food deprivation and a ketogenic diet showed a decrease in mast cell [Ca2+]i mobilization induced by exposure to compound 48/80. Furthermore, in vitro D-BHB treatment with mast cells delivered from a control diet rat also suppressed degranulation and [Ca2+]i mobilization (Figure 4).",a688da29-acd7-4080-87e0-7d7886dc96ce
33,discussion3," G protein coupled receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C and the associated production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate induces release of Ca2+ from stores in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus through Ca2+-conducting IP3-receptors. Compound 48/80 is also known to initiate mast cell degranulation through direct activation of G proteins, which was proposed to mimic receptor signaling [34,35]. Thus, we speculate that D-BHB might have inhibited downstream of G-protein coupled intracellular signaling pathway, which leads to stabilization of mast cell membranes against degranulation stimuli. Further study is necessary to determine the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) underlying the stabilization of mast cells by D-BHB.  During a fasting state, D-BHB is synthesized in the liver from acetyl-CoA mostly derived from beta-oxidation of fatty acids.",3bd6e424-c61a-4d4b-a2e8-2ad01d659137
34,discussion4," The rate limiting step of D-BHB formation is mitochondrial hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (mHMG-CoAS), which converts acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA into 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA [36]. The enzymatic activity of HMG-CoAS is elevated by deacetylation by sirtuin-3 (Sitrt3) [37]. Also, the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signal controls D-BHB formation during fasting by modulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor mediated activation of the mHMG-CoAS enzyme [38]. Sirt3 and mTOR are known as key regulators of energy metabolic homeostasis during fasting and calorie restriction [39,40], which has been linked to ameliorate diseases associate with aging [41,42]. Several studies have shown that calorie restriction can mitigate excessive immune response [43-46], but the mechanisms for this attenuation are still largely unknown. Prolonged restriction of calorie intake also leads to higher serum D-BHB concentrations [47-49].",008080cd-7a34-42a0-827d-e1c03b7adb3a
35,discussion5," Altogether, our findings with the pleiotropic property of D-BHB were able to rule out the possibility that D-BHB is not the only alternative energy source that spares glucose, but is one of the defense molecules that participates in a number of health benefits during dietary restriction.  Conclusion We demonstrated that fasting attenuated immediate hypersensitivity symptoms. In addition, we provided evidence that D-BHB generated by fasting plays an important role for the sedate excess immune response against immediate hypersensitivity. We believe further investigations focused on the role of ketone bodies in immunological function will pave the way to understanding the molecular mechanisms for the positive health benefits of fasting.
