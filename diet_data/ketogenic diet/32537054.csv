0,introduction0," Status epilepticus (SE) is one of the most common severe conditions seen at pediatric hospitals. The incidence of SE in childhood is between 17 and 23/100,000, with higher rates in early infancy (1). Hospital mortality is 3%; ~12% of SE patients have suffered from previous epilepsy. Between 10 and 40% of patients progress to refractory SE (refractory SE (RSE)) (2–4).  Up to 7–17% of refractory SE (RSE) patients progress to super-refractory status epilepticus (super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE))), necessitating treatment with anesthetics at a pediatric intensive care unit (pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)) (5–9). super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) is defined as SE that continues or recurs 24 h or more after the initiation of anesthetic treatment (10).",da290f46-6686-4827-8e0b-8ca97b387240
1,introduction1," super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) is a catastrophic condition with mortality rates of up to 50% (11), and up to 55% of survivors suffering from irreversible severe neurological deficits (12).  The drugs most commonly used in super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) are midazolam, pentobarbital, ketamine, and inhaled anesthetics. However, to date there is still lack of evidence on the optimal treatment for the individual pediatric patient (10, 13, 14).  The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that mimics the fasting state and is used for the therapy of drug-resistant childhood epilepsy (10, 15–17). Multiple mechanisms of action of KD have been reported. It appears to influence the relative balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters and may modify inflammatory processes in the brain (18–21).",9b1f3cac-43bf-4891-9fdb-e478faf98efe
2,introduction2,"  Recently, several pediatric case series on KD in refractory (refractory SE (RSE)) and super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) have reported successful interruption in 20–90% within 1–7 days after initiation of KD (22–26), also highlighted in recent reviews (27). Only in adults, a prospective multicenter study provides Class IV evidence of the effectiveness of the KD (28). In most reported pediatric cases, KD was performed via enteral route and ketosis measured only in urine. Furthermore, the majority of reported patients had primarily inflammatory causes of SE such as febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES)) or unknown causes (29). Few studies provided detailed descriptions of etiology, in particular results of genetic testing, and electrophysiological data.",2e82003d-f213-4876-b588-a299856219fe
3,introduction3,  The aim of the current study was to evaluate both feasibility and effectiveness of KD in children with super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) treated at a tertiary care center.  ,7a57348f-72e0-40a2-a26a-0efd9186c710
4,methods0," Study Design  Clinical and EEG data of consecutive children with super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) treated with KD in addition to standard treatment at the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of our center (Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria) from September 2008 to December 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. Data were derived from a longitudinal electronic database containing the complete medical records of all patients with SE at our institution and those treated with KD. For data entry into the database, informed parental consent was obtained. Data collection and analysis were approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Medical University of Vienna (Ethikkommission der Medizinischen Universität Wien, EK.-No. 1594/2019). super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) was defined as SE that continues or recurs 24 h or more after the initiation of anesthetic treatment (10).",7f19218c-3a81-4399-baa5-8af318f166ac
5,methods1,"  In our center, we adhere to the SE protocol published by Trinka et al. (14) and Trinka and Kälviäinen (30). This staged treatment protocol includes lorazepam, diazepam, clonazepam, or phenobarbital for stage I; phenytoin, valproate, levetiracetam, or lacosamide for stage II; and propofol, midazolam, thiopental, or pentobarbital for stage III (refractory SE). For super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)), we adhere to the treatment protocol suggested by Shorvon and Ferlisi (10), which recommends general anesthesia including ketamine and AED; however, we use the KD early.  Study Population and Introduction of Ketogenic Diet  Study inclusion criteria were treatment with KD for super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) at our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and age <18 years at time of presentation. Patients with previous use of KD or contraindications to KD were excluded.",fd8ceb28-396a-42f0-a9c2-0c6be490bc9e
6,methods2,"  Before initiation of the KD, a thorough neurologic and pediatric examination, video-electroencephalogram (video-EEG), and fasting blood samples were obtained. Furthermore, metabolic diseases contraindicating KD were excluded by reviewing newborn metabolic testing performed at our clinic and by standard metabolic analysis including organic acids in urine (available within 48 h) (31, 32).  The following patient characteristics were documented and used for analysis: the presence of known or unknown etiology including etiology groups according to ID/Gender Age at SE onset (months) Treatment response Etiology (ILAE) criteria (structural, genetic, metabolic, infectious, and immune etiologies) (33); demographic and diagnostic data [age, gender, number of AEDs (before, during, and after KD), epilepsy syndrome, seizure semiology, EEG patterns, and outcome].",fff16102-6948-4abd-a61d-920ef001a20f
7,methods3,"  After informed consent, an individualized KD diet plan was established for each patient by a trained and experienced dietitian using a computer-based algorithm (34). In most patients, the diet was started at a fat/non-fat ratio of 1:1. Depending on the clinical condition and the neurological state of the patient the diet was administered via parenteral, enteral, or combined parenteral and enteral route. For enteral route, a ketogenic formula (Ketocal; Nutricia Metabolics, Erlangen, Germany; fat/non-fat ratio of 3:1 or 4:1) was used. For parenteral administration, a mixed infusion was prescribed by the ketogenic diet team (pediatric epileptologist A.D. and a dietitian P.T.S.) (34, 35). All other medications were changed to carbohydrate-free formulations when feasible compensating for carbohydrates by adding additional grams of fat (36).",4aaff62a-a129-45da-936a-a3aadac4662d
8,methods4,"  The amounts of ketogenic formula and/or infusion were then increased stepwise to reach a fat/non-fat ratio of 4:1 (maximum), adjusted and monitored by serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels. Our aim was to achieve ketosis (BHB >2 mmol/L) as soon as possible without causing hypoglycemia (serum glucose <50 mg/dl) or severe acidosis (serum bicarbonate >15 mmol/L). When BHB levels were lower than 2 mmol/L, fat/non-fat ratio was increased individually on a daily basis until stable ketosis (between 2 and 5 mmol/L) was achieved. Serum glucose, BHB, and urine ketone levels were measured three times a day while KD was established. Response to KD at the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was evaluated daily by a pediatric neurologist and by regular EEG recordings. All EEG recordings were reanalyzed for the purpose of this study. An example of a detailed individual prescription of a KD regimen is given in Table 1.",e4a9abe8-c924-4ec8-81e2-0cd8ea2fc8cf

Outcome Variables  Primary outcome parameter was frequency (in %) of patients showing clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) resolution of super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) within 7 days after starting KD (“responders”). Response was defined as the absence of clinical seizures and ≥50% of the EEG record time showing suppression below 10 μV on longitudinal bipolar montage according to the previous publication by Arya et al. (23).  Secondary outcome parameters included time from initiation of KD to termination of super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) (in hours), time to achieve clinically relevant ketosis in serum (BHB >2 mmol/L, in hours), time until complete withdrawal of anesthetic drugs after KD start, duration of KD, seizure frequency at last follow-up, and survival (long-term outcome).",201274a0-6554-485e-ab15-e9060ade6a80
11,methods8," Moreover, adverse effects were documented in parental diaries.  Follow-Up Visits  After discharge, urine ketone levels, seizures, nutrition, and adverse effects were documented in a patient diary by parents or caregivers. At each outpatient visit, a thorough pediatric and neurological examination as well as nutritional consults were performed. In addition, blood was analyzed at each outpatient visit including fasting serum glucose and BHB according to our center's standardized protocol (37, 38). Outpatient visits were performed 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after KD start in all patients, also after discontinuing the KD.  Data Analysis  Patient demographics and clinical characteristics and outcomes are summarized by descriptive statistics (frequency, median, interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)), range).

12,results0," Patient Demographics  Between September 2008 and December 2019, a total of 98 patients with SE were treated at our center. Eight of these (8.1%) developed super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) who all received KD in addition to standard of care. Age at onset of super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) patients was median 13.6 months (interquartile range (IQR) 0.9–105). Five patients had epilepsy before super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) presentation. The etiology was unknown in 2 (25%) patients (Otahara syndrome), and known etiology was observed as follows: genetic etiology in 4 (50%) patients, structural etiology in 1 (12.5%) patient [tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and focal cortical dysplasia (focal cortical dysplasia (FCD)) IIB], and autoimmune etiology in 1 (12.5%) patient (febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES)).

26,discussion0," We describe a cohort of eight critically ill children with super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) due to a variety of etiologies. Our incidence of 8% of super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) among all SE patients lies within the range for pediatric cohorts (5). As a center specialized in KD, we considered this therapeutic option for the treatment of super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) early. Ketosis could be achieved in most patients within 90 h after KD start (Figure 1). The feasibility of implementing the KD was challenging due to intensive care procedures such as airway management and severe adverse effects such as the occurrence of pancreatitis and the concurrent administration of glucose-containing medications as well as the difficulty to achieve high ketone levels by parenteral routes.",13bd70bf-c451-4d38-a99e-0ced7a8505ec

Only 37% of our patients survived; only one of them was a “responder” to the KD (patient 5/SCNA2 mutation). The combination of KD with midazolam showed better response and fewer adverse effects compared with other anesthetic drugs. In 2/3 patients who received propofol during KD as single doses, the KD had to be discontinued due to adverse effects.

28,discussion2," Therefore, current guidelines for the use of parenteral KD do not recommend the introduction of KD during propofol anesthesia, but if necessary only with caution (40).  In our series of patients, we observed a response rate of 50% (95% CI: 22–78%), which is lower than in some other reports of SE patients treated with KD. This is likely related to severe underlying diseases in our patients. Fifty percent of patients were diagnosed with genetic syndromes, 37.5% of them with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome with POLG mutations, a severe degenerative neurological disease with per se unfavorable outcome (41). SE interruption was achieved in 2 (of 3) of these patients with Alpers syndrome; however, all three died due to their underlying mitochondrial disease.

29,discussion3," The highest response rates of up to 90% were reported in cohorts consisting mostly of immune mediated SE such as febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) (22, 25). Few studies included (or gave detailed information on) genetic causes of SE.  We achieved ketosis within median 3.5 days; in one patient (patient 8) with febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) high-dose methylprednisolone was administered shortly before KD initiation and overlapping for the first 3 days of KD delaying initial ketosis (cf. Figure 1). Our data are in line with other studies who reported ketosis within a median of 2–5.5 days (22–25), not all of them measuring ketosis in serum.  In 63% of our patients, the KD was administered (at least partly) via parenteral routes. This is a higher proportion compared with other recent studies [10–23% in literature (22, 23)], likely related to more severe general conditions and critical illness.",4fd621b5-4e5f-434b-b043-7147dedc5361
30,discussion4," Several studies propose parenteral KD as a feasible method in the intensive care setting (34, 40). Although gastrointestinal motility is frequently reduced in SE, it is important to administer the KD via the enteral route (oral or via gastric tube) as early as possible. The time until relevant ketosis is reached may be delayed due to the limited fat/non-fat ratio if primarily administered parenterally. As soon as an (additional) enteral route is available, ketosis can be achieved more rapidly.  Recent KD studies showed different definitions of adequate ketosis. The most commonly applied biomarker is dipstick ketone testing in urine, although it correlates only poorly with serum ketones. Even the current gold standard in ketosis analysis (31, 36), the measuring of BHB levels in serum is merely a surrogate marker that gives limited information on the metabolic milieu in the brain. In this study, we strictly defined ketosis by serum BHB levels >2 mmol/L (34).",51878058-2217-4ee9-b004-40ca4805e9e6
31,discussion5,"  Another area of variability is the definition of response in SE in the literature. We used a strict definition (absence of seizures and suppression-burst ratio ≥50% in EEG within 7 days), as proposed by Arya et al. (23), to allow direct comparison of outcome data.  Although KD has been proposed as effective therapy also for the early (or even prophylactic) treatment of SE (42), at our institution the use of KD was limited to the more severe and super-refractory cases. Nevertheless, the KD was introduced within 9 days after SE onset (median 6 days) in seven of our eight patients. In comparable other studies, this period was significantly longer [median ranging from 12.8 to 18 days (5, 22–34, 36–40, 40–43)]. All our patients (100%) showed a certain degree of adverse effects to the KD; however, the diet had to be discontinued due to adverse effects in only 2 (25%) patients.",5687561d-3f38-4f84-91a5-33bcd4935c77
32,discussion6," Although the overall rate of adverse effects is higher than in other reports (0–33%) (22–24, 43), the proportion of discontinued cases (25%) is in line with literature (0–33%) (23, 24, 43). This again might suggest a variability in the definition and reporting of adverse effects associated with KD.  There are some limitations to this study. First, although data were collected prospectively, analysis of super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) patients was done retrospectively. We minimized this limitation by ensuring that all pediatric patients with super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) treated with KD were included. Second, the relatively small number of patients limits the generalization of data due to individual therapeutic decision-making. Third, our series has an overrepresentation of children with severe underlying disease (Alpers syndrome, SCN2A), in half of the patients leading to death or poor neurological long-term outcome.",2c60c0e8-c078-4049-b13a-6963ea19ecf3
33,discussion7," This stands in contrast to the literature in which usually more cases with immune-mediated causes are included. However, we describe an initial response in 66% of our patients with Alpers syndrome. Moreover, regular measurements of BHB levels were more difficult to obtain in the intensive care setting during critical illness, also due to concurrent medications.  Strengths of our study are that it represents a group of super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) patients in whom the KD was started early, as well as the rapid achievement of ketosis in most patients, which underlines the importance of an experienced ketogenic diet team including physicians and dietitians who can introduce and monitor the diet. Another strength is the detailed clinical and etiological description of our patients.  Conclusion  We report a cohort of eight pediatric super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory SE (RSE)) patients treated with KD at our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).",1a8ed109-f679-431b-838e-e3f31bdf0c19
34,discussion8," According to a strict definition of favorable response, 50% responded to treatment. Our data suggest initial effectiveness and safety of early KD, also in patients with severe underlying genetic syndromes. However, only a minority of our severely ill patients survived. In spite of lack of controlled trials in children, our study supports the consideration of KD as treatment option in all patients treated for SE in an intensive care setting.
