0,methods0," 2.1. Design and Setting  This open-label, pilot, single-center, prospective clinical study has been investigator-initiated to evaluate the efficacy of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) in promoting changes in handgrip strength (HGS) in a population of women with obesity. Female participants were enlisted from May 2020 to March 2022 at the Unit of Endocrinology, Obesity Unit (Centro Italiano per la cura e il Benessere del paziente con Obesità “C.I.B.O.” and European Association for the Study of Obesity, Collaborating Centre for Obesity Management “European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO)-COMs”), Clinical Medicine and Surgery Department, University of Naples Federico II; Naples, Italy.  This clinical study included a total of two outpatient visits and seven telephone interviews by a nutritionist to assess dietary adherence, any changes in physical activity levels, and the measurement of ketone bodies from capillary blood.",3779d715-a872-4370-af43-249dbb97079f
1,methods1," In addition, any changes to the standard recommendations given by the nutritionist were reported. In particular, at baseline and after 45 days of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD), anthropometric measurements, handgrip strength (HGS), and body composition were evaluated. Blood samples were obtained for the evaluation of hs-CRP.  This clinical study was previously been approved by the Federico II Ethical Committee with protocol number 50/20. All patients were informed of the study design and purpose, subsequently giving their informed consent.  2.2. Population Study  A total of 247 Caucasian women with a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) between 30.0 and 50.9 kg/m2, aged 18–51 years, were consecutively enrolled in this clinical study. All these women had a history of failed dietary attempts and the desire to lose weight.",7f28643b-adbc-45bc-85d4-37b1c0c24140
2,methods2," An endocrinologist collected the complete medical history and ruled out any contraindications to prescribing the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD), in accordance with the guidelines of the Society of Endocrinology (SIE) [6]. Physical activity levels were assessed in all participants using a YES/NO response (at least 30 min/day aerobic exercise), as also reported in previous studies [22,23]. To increase the homogeneity of the clinical study, the exclusion criteria adopted were:Underweight, normal-weight, and overweight subjects;  Male gender;  Menopausal women, defined with at least 12 months of amenorrhea or LH levels > 30 IU/L;  Pregnancy or breastfeeding;  Type 1 and T2DM;  Smokers;  Women taking anti-inflammatory or anti-obesity drugs one month before enrollment in the study or women occasionally or currently taking medications that could influence musculoskeletal system and handgrip strength (HGS), including anticonvulsants,",84e9f0a7-98a1-41de-bea6-4d117487b1fd

In addition, participants were evaluated at baseline, in the early follicular phase.  2.3.",a410bde2-6b33-44d3-a477-e9087ab7e68e
4,methods4," Handgrip Strength Test  Muscle strength was assessed by handgrip strength (HGS) measured using a dynamometer (Lafayette Hydraulic hand dynamometer model J00105) that provides the record of muscle strength in kilograms (kg). All measurements were performed under strictly standardized conditions by the same clinical nutritionist and the same dynamometer in order to avoid inter-observer and inter-device variability, after explaining the procedure to each participant, as previously reported [24]. Subjects were guided to obtain the correct positioning, which included sitting, with shoulders adducted and in a neutral rotation, the elbows flexed to 90°, and the forearms and wrists slightly extended (up to 30°), as recommended by the American Society of Hand Therapists [25]. Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamometer with their nondominant arm three times at maximum isometric force (for 5 s). To avoid fatigue between each repetition, 1 min of rest was observed [26].",24423990-4b76-4f48-b7e6-b6dbbda6069a
5,methods5," When they were unable to perform handgrip strength (HGS) with their non-dominant hand, participants used their dominant hand. In this study, the average of the three attempts was considered for the analysis. The dynamometer was routinely checked with resistors and capacitors of known values. The cut-off point used for low handgrip strength (HGS) in women was <16 kg [20].  2.4. Anthropometric Measurements  As widely reported in previous studies [27,28,29], the anthropometric parameters were assessed by the same trained health care operator at a time between 8 and 10 am. The subjects, who had been fasting since the previous evening, were asked to wear light clothing and to remove their shoes during the assessments. Weight and height were used to calculate body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2). A wall stadiometer (0.5 cm approximation) and a calibrated beam scale (0.1 kg approximation) were used for height and weight measurements, respectively.",3d0d7ad8-a6b8-4301-b2a4-14de00e434aa
6,methods6," World Health Organization criteria [30] were used for body mass index (BMI) classification into:Overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m2);  Obesity grade I (30.0–34.9 kg/m2);  Obesity grade II (35.0–39.9 kg/m2);  Obesity grade III (≥40.0 kg/m2).  Regarding waist circumference (WC) measurement, patients were measured while standing with feet together and arms loosely along the sides, breathing normally [22,23,27], using a nonelastic tape up to 0.1 cm at the narrowest point. In patients with the highest degree of obesity or where the narrowest waist point was not available, WC was assessed with 0.1 cm at the umbilical level using the same measuring tape [31].  2.5. Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) Intervention  Subjects who fulfilled inclusion/exclusion criteria underwent the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) protocol with total meal replacement consisting of three main stages (active, re-education, and maintenance).",f3340ded-d7f4-49f8-9d90-bc62ac562efb
7,methods7," A commercial weight-loss program was used for the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) (New Penta Srl, Cuneo, Italy). The active-stage diet was planned by a skilled nutritionist and recommended by the endocrinologist. As for diet composition, total energy intake was <800 kcal/day and it was provided by 13% carbohydrates (<30 g/day), 43% protein (1.3 g/kg ideal body weight), and 44% fat. During the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD), replacement meals with high biological value were used, with protein coming from whey, soy, eggs, and peas. According to international recommendations [5], supplementation of B-complex vitamins; vitamins C and E; minerals, including potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium; and omega-3 fatty acids at the same dosage was planned to maintain the physiological acid/base balance (PentaCal, New Penta, Ltd., Cuneo, Italy). An example of a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) scheme with meal replacements is shown in Supplementary Materials File S1.",641c0aa9-d7ec-4c12-9107-5226066bcf53
8,methods8,"  2.6. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis  bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was performed by the same skilled nutritionist using the same phase-sensitive bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-device (an 800 A current, frequency 50 kHz bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) 101 RJL, Akern Bioresearch, Florence, Italy) [32] and under strictly standardized conditions to reduce inter-device and inter-observer variability. According to the European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN)) guidelines [33], the assessment was performed with patients lying supine with limbs slightly apart from their body, not having indulged in any food/beverages or physical exercise in the previous six hours, nor consumed any alcohol 24 h before the assessment, as widely reported in previous studies [34,35,36].",f82961be-cc53-4fa2-b7b0-143a6b9ed2bb
9,methods9," In addition, all patients were asked to empty their bladder 30 min before the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) evaluation, according to Kyle et al. [33]. Patients were asked to remove their shoes and socks immediately before the application of the electrodes, and the contact surfaces were cleaned with alcohol. The electrodes (bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)TRODES Akern Srl; Florence, Italy) were placed on the right hand (proximal to the phalangeal-metacarpal joint on the dorsal surface) and the right foot (distal to the transverse arch on the superior surface of the right foot). The sensing electrodes were placed on the right wrist (midway between the distal projection of the radius and the ulna) and the right ankle (between the medial and lateral malleoli) [37]. Every day, the skilled nutritionist checked the device with resistors and capacitors of known values: the same observer detected an intraday variation < 2.3% for resistance (R) and <2.",b1e3cbbc-311d-4185-9437-2c8203ea9e99
10,methods10,"1% for reactance (Xc), as well as an interday variation < 3.1% for R and <2.4% for Xc. The coefficient of variation (CV) of repeated measurements of R and Xc at 50 kHz was determined in 10 females by the same observer: CVs were 1.1% for R and 1.2% for Xc, and phase angle (PhA) was derived from the conditions at 50 kHz, according to the following formula: PhA (°, degrees) = arc tangent Xc/Rx(180/π).  2.7. Compliance to Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)  Compliance to the recommendations for the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) and physical activity was assessed by weekly individual telephone counseling by an endocrinologist and nutritionist. In addition, once a week, participants were asked to measure β-hydroxybutyrate from capillary blood using test strips (Optium Xceed Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System; Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA).",7c36f0ea-997b-4e1d-bc2d-c59b09cd57d7
11,methods11," More specifically, at baseline and at the end of the dietary intervention (Day 45), β-hydroxybutyrate levels were measured by the nutritionist at the outpatient clinic. Furthermore, blood ketone levels were also checked directly by the patients at home once a week, in the morning on an empty stomach, preferably at the same time, and the levels were reported to the nutritionist during the telephone interview, which as carried out once a week.  2.8. Assay Methods  Blood samples were collected between 8.00–10.00 a.m. after an overnight fast (at least 8 h), and the samples were immediately stored at −80 °C until the assay. hs-CRP levels were assessed by a high-sensitivity nephelometric assay (CardioPhase, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany). The CV of intra- and interassay was <7%.  2.9. Statistical Analysis  Participants who completed the study, including all available examinations at both baseline and 45 days, were included in the analysis of the collected data.",465d4f58-f80a-4259-8b05-b7716d62d4d6
12,methods12," These were analyzed with the SPSS software package (IBM, SPSS Statistics, version 22, Armonk, NY, USA). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to test data distribution. Skewed variables were normalized by logarithm transformation and re-converted into tables and figures. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) or percentages (%) were used to present the data. The outcomes between the baseline and after the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) were compared using the Student’s paired t-test. The chi square (χ2) test was used to test differences in frequency distribution across body mass index (BMI), WC, handgrip strength (HGS), and physical activity categories. Pearson’s correlation was used to assess the association between percentage changes (delta ∆%) pre/post intervention.",1d6b1393-4bb7-4b7a-b112-72e8196f6047
13,methods13," A partial correlation was performed to adjust the associations among ∆handgrip strength (HGS) with ∆fat mass (FM) and ∆free fat mass (fat free mass (FFM)) for confounding factors (∆body mass index (BMI), ∆WC, ∆hs-CRP levels, and physical activity). Because this was a pilot study, no power calculations were performed. Therefore, all findings need to be confirmed by larger clinical trials.  3. Results  A total of 247 women with obesity, aged 35.4 ± 10.5 years, met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the analyses. All subjects were evaluated at baseline and after 45 days of the active stage of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD).  Adherence to the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) was assessed and confirmed in all the patients by a telephone interview once a week and patients were asked about their physical activity.",16e93996-8ec1-48b2-81f7-84961771d750
14,methods14," Additionally, each patient was called the day before the interview to instruct them to do the ketosis capillary test the next morning, while fasting and just before breakfast, and the results were reported on the day of the interview by the nutritionist. As reported in Table 2, no patient changed her physical activity levels during the 45 days of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD).  The anthropometric characteristics, body composition parameters, and hs-CRP levels of the study population, at baseline and after 45 days of active stage of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD), are shown in Table 2. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), WC, and hs-CRP levels were significantly diminished (p < 0.001). Therefore, the distribution of subjects across the body mass index (BMI) categories was significantly modified, with the increase in the prevalence of overweight women (+18.6%), while the prevalence of individuals with Grade III obesity dropped to −14.2% (p < 0.001).",f4c382c4-c52e-4679-b67e-ccdf6086e40b
15,methods15," Among bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) parameters, R (p = 0.019) and FM (p < 0.001) expressed as absolute value in kg were significantly reduced. In addition, fat free mass (FFM), expressed as absolute value in kg, showed a significant decrease (p = 0.001), but its percentage value was highly increased (pre 55.9 ± 6.3% vs. post 59.9 ± 6.7%; p < 0.0001), with an overall improvement in body composition. Interestingly, after 45 days of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD), handgrip strength (HGS) cut off was significantly improved (+11.0%, p < 0.001) (Table 2).  Figure 1 reports the handgrip strength (HGS) changes after 45 days of active phase the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD). In particular, post-Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD), handgrip strength (HGS) measures was significantly increased (p < 0.001).  The participants were grouped according to the cut off of handgrip strength (HGS); Table 3.",fbec0f17-7194-4cd4-9029-0a0e32ef9d07
16,methods16," As shown in the table, women with handgrip strength (HGS) values higher than the cut-off point (≥16 kg) exhibited significant differences compared with those with handgrip strength (HGS) below the cut-off value (<16 kg). In particular, women with handgrip strength (HGS) values below the cut-off had higher values of body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001), WC (p < 0.001), R (p = 0.019), FM (p = 0.018), hs-CRP levels (p = 0.017), and lower values of fat free mass (FFM) (p < 0.001) than those with values above the cut-off value; Table 3.  The correlation between the changes in ∆handgrip strength (HGS)% and changes in anthropometric parameters, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) parameters, and hs-CRP levels are reported in Table 4. Changes in ∆handgrip strength (HGS)% were significantly negatively correlated with changes in ∆body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001), ∆WC (p = 0.006), ∆R (p < 0.001), ∆FM (p < 0.001), and ∆hs-CRP levels (p = 0.",4caa795e-a36a-4084-97d0-1e14faeaa21e
17,methods17,"022), and positively correlated with ∆fat free mass (FFM) (p < 0.001).  Finally, as reported in Figure 2, after adjusting for ∆body mass index (BMI), ∆WC, ∆hs-CRP levels, and physical activity, the correlation between changes in ∆handgrip strength (HGS) and ∆FM remained statistically significant (r = −0.331, p < 0.001). Similarly, the correlation between ∆handgrip strength (HGS) and ∆fat free mass (FFM) also remained statistically significant after adjustment for confounding factors (r = 0.362, p < 0.001). Interestingly, the correlations between ∆handgrip strength (HGS) with ∆FM and ∆fat free mass (FFM) were also independent of the percentage of weight loss (r = −0.288, p < 0.001 and r = 0.395, p < 0.001).  After adjusting for ∆body mass index (BMI), ∆WC, ∆hs-CRP levels, and physical activity, the correlation between changes in ∆handgrip strength (HGS) and ∆FM remained statistically significant (r = −0.331, p < 0.001).",5d5eb528-5733-4852-8145-2504a38e2919

Discussion  The aim of this prospective study was to assess the efficacy of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) in promoting changes in handgrip strength (HGS) and hs-CRP levels as a marker of inflammation in a population of women with obesity after 45 days of the active phase of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD).",205bd87a-a97d-47e2-beaa-55c4b8fd9652
19,methods19," As expected, we obtained a significant reduction in body weight and FM in all the study participants. Of interest, fat free mass (FFM), expressed as an absolute value in kg, also showed a significant decrease, but its percentage value was highly increased, with an overall improvement in body composition. This finding was in line with a recent study by Paoli et al. (2021) in a group of patients with PCOS treated with a KD for 12 weeks [38]. In particular, these Authors reported that the study participants lost their weight with a significant reduction in FM accompanied by a slightly significant loss of fat free mass (FFM), as absolute value in kg, but with a highly significant increase in its percentage value.  As novel findings, we found that muscle strength evaluated by handgrip strength (HGS) testing increased by 17.4%, while hs-CRP levels reduced significantly.",429361ab-f77e-43da-9781-73a92b54c938
20,methods20," The increase in handgrip strength (HGS) was also significantly negatively correlated with changes in body mass index (BMI), WC, FM, and hs-CRP levels, and positively correlated with changes in fat free mass (FFM). The positive association between handgrip strength (HGS) and fat free mass (FFM) was still evident after adjusting for changes in body mass index (BMI), WC, hs-CRP levels, physical activity, and percentage of weight loss.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that lends support to the significant increase in fat free mass (FFM) as percentage values during the active stage of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD), evidencing that this increase is associated either with favorable effects on muscle strength, measured by handgrip strength (HGS) testing, and the inflammatory status evaluated by hs-CRP levels. In addition, we characterized the study participants according to the results of the handgrip strength (HGS) test.",fdd24a8f-c8a9-442f-ac04-c4404165acf6
21,methods21," Of interest, the study participants with handgrip strength (HGS) values lower than the cut-off point also exhibited higher body mass index (BMI), visceral adiposity measured by WC, FM, and hs-CRP levels, as well as lower values of fat free mass (FFM) compared with their counterpart with handgrip strength (HGS) values above the cut-off point. Increasing the knowledge regarding the possible mechanism involved in the preservation of fat free mass (FFM) is a crucial factor in the maintenance of long-term weight loss after completing the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) protocols.  Paoli et al. (2019) extensively evaluated the relationship between KD and muscle mass regulatory pathways, and suggested that a protective role for muscle anabolism could be mediated by the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase, with changes in the Akt/mTOR pathways [12].",fa4868d6-c0fc-4275-bb94-f2cd34b744b6
22,methods22," In addition, the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) has been demonstrated to reduce inflammation more significantly than other dietary regimens [39]. The anti-inflammatory effects of KD were recently reported in an extensive review of KD in the management of sarcopenic obesity [40]. In particular, a recently published extensive review reported the beneficial effects of ketone bodies in reducing inflammation and metabolic complications involved in NAFLD pathogenesis [41]. Among ketone bodies, β-hydroxybutyrate has been shown to exert both anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic effects on human skeletal muscle by inhibiting the activation of the Nf-κB pathway [2,42]. Very recently, Camajani et al.",a24239cf-df90-4a79-81a9-b1d2377d13f9
23,methods23," [43] described the beneficial effects of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) combined with physical exercise in reducing FM, improving metabolic profile, and preserving skeletal muscle performance in a woman with sarcopenic obesity two weeks after hospitalization for severe COVID-19 disease. In the context of a link between the inflammatory status and fat free mass (FFM), a very recently published study reported the benefits of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for muscle function in healthy older adults to target inflammation and to improve the “anabolic resistance” to exercise associated with aging [44], while an extensive review examined the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties of extra virgin olive oil in delaying/preventing loss of muscle mass and function [45].  Of note, in our study group, the positive association between fat free mass (FFM) and handgrip strength (HGS) appears to be independent regarding changes in hs-CRP levels.",8c7fdd22-7e61-4062-bb83-0092658f831c
24,methods24," In line with the current literature [46], this observation pointed out the importance of ensuring an adequate intake of protein, both in terms of quantity (1.2–1.5 g/kg ideal body weight), and quality, with high-biological-value protein preparations, such as those we used in this study. In this context, the results of a very recent meta-analysis on the use of protein intake to support muscle mass and function in healthy adults showed that there was not a significant difference when performing the analysis of subgroups by age [47]. However, it is tempting to speculate that the low insulin-to-glucagon ratio induced by the severe restriction in carbohydrates intake during the active phase of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) could be associated with multiple changes in endocrine axes involved in the regulation of body composition [38,48,49,50], including the somatotropic axis [51].  We are aware that our study has some limitations, but also a number of strengths.",ad73e161-d3de-4a27-91fd-fe1b7b496d1c
25,methods25," First, despite the fact that this pilot study was conducted on a large study population considering the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) setting, the study involved only a single-center, and this may have introduced some selection bias. However, the homogeneity of the population was enhanced by including only premenopausal women to avoid the possible influence of estrogenic decline on changes in muscle strength and mass.  Second, we did not include a control group on a non-KD. Therefore, we can only speculate that ketosis, rather than weight loss per se, could exert the favorable changes in the handgrip strength (HGS). Of note, these changes were also independent of physical activity, as the participants in this study did not change their physical activity during the 45 days of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD).",f1f63528-faa7-45b6-98ab-407304c59aa1
26,methods26," Nevertheless, the beneficial effects of brief Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) on inflammation in patients with overweight and obesity have been extensively reported [1,2,7,11,42], along with the superiority of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)s over other low-calorie dietary regimens for inducing weight loss [52].  Third, we have not assessed other inflammatory and antioxidant markers. However, CRP represents the most investigated inflammatory biomarker for several diseases [53]. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that, besides the intervention of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD), other factors could also play an important role in the variations in handgrip strength (HGS) values. Finally, being a pilot study, we did not extend our observations to subsequent stages of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) to confirm the association between fat free mass (FFM) and handgrip strength (HGS).",e1062481-326c-4e13-8de8-3a0e9b0a0b54
27,methods27," However, the very short observation length prevented patients from abandoning the protocol.  5. Conclusions  In this pilot study, we first reported that, along with a significant reduction in body weight and an overall improvement in body composition and inflammatory status, the muscle strength evaluated by handgrip strength (HGS) testing increased in a population of women with obesity after 45 days of the active stage of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD), even following adjustments for common confounding variables. These findings also lend support to the increase in fat free mass (FFM) during the active stage of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) and show the usefulness of the handgrip strength (HGS) test in the nutritional management of patients with obesity as a possible additional diagnostic tool to CRP to evaluate changes in the inflammation status and the correct planning of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) protocol stages.",e657fda0-b728-46fb-8f34-01090bf0f90a
28,methods28," However, further studies extending the observations to subsequent stages of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) compared with other hypocaloric dietary programs to unravel the relative role of ketosis and weight loss, are mandatory to confirm the association between fat free mass (FFM) and handgrip strength (HGS).
