0,methods0," 2.1. Animals and Diet  Studies were conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) at Brigham Young University. Additionally, experiments have been reported in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines 2.0 on reporting animal experiments.  Adult (average age of 10.7 months at sacrifice, SEM = 0.88) male and female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories, group-housed, and maintained at 22 ± 1 °C, 60–70% humidity, and a 12-h light–dark cycle. Mice were randomly divided into two groups and given ad libitum access to food—a control rodent diet (control rodent diet (CON)) or a ketogenic diet supplemented with an exogenous ketone ester (ketogenic (KETO))—and water. The control rodent diet (CON) diet was purchased from LabDiet (5001).",1fce6cd4-fe0a-4acd-9959-93910579c7a6
1,methods1," The ketogenic (KETO) diet was made up of a lard-based KD paste (BioServ (F3666), R,S-1,3-butanediol acetoacetate diester (ketone ester, KE; Disruptive Enterprises), and sugar-free peanut butter (Jif) to improve palatability and prevent excessive weight loss.  The ketogenic (KETO) diet was mixed freshly twice a week or more often as was necessary and, by weight, was composed of 90% KD, 5% KE, and 5% peanut butter, which translated to a macronutrient composition of 90% kcal fat, 4.7% kcal protein, 2% kcal carbohydrate, and 3.3% kcal KE (Table 1). This assumed a caloric density of 4.7 kcal/g for the KE, previously established in other work [36]. Weight was measured once a week, or more frequently if body weight appeared to be declining, especially in ketogenic (KETO) mice during the first two weeks of diet conditioning.",1e0a8afa-b0f5-4a88-a777-ef33a0ba1a43
2,methods2," To maintain as many mice as possible in the study, if the weights approached the 20% cutoff, the concentration of peanut butter was increased (and keto diet paste reduced) to promote palatability and prevent further weight loss. Mice were excluded if >20% of their initial body weight was lost.  Ketone and glucose measurements were taken once a week to ensure diet efficacy. Blood was drawn via tail tip amputation and tail massage, which has been suggested as a superior method for reducing animal distress compared to tail vein incision and facial vein puncture [37]. Precision Xtra blood glucose and ketone meters (Abbott) were used to measure the blood glucose and R-BHB concentrations. BHB is a chiral molecule, with R and S enantiomers, which are differentially metabolized [38]. R-BHB is the primary product of normal metabolism and is readily metabolized to acetyl CoA to produce ATP. S-BHB, however, is not a normal product of rodent nor human metabolism.",02ab144e-9efd-4f89-88ee-c387d297e3c2
3,methods3," Although it is largely converted to R-BHB, the metabolism of S-BHB is much slower, and can account for sustained elevations in ketones with KE administration [39]. Although we did not measure the blood S-BHB, the racemic R,S-1,3-butanediol acetoacetate diester likely elevated both R- and S-BHB.  Researchers collecting data were not blinded to the animals’ diets.  2.2. Two-Object Novel Object Recognition  The novel object recognition (novel object recognition (NOR)) assay is a simple, widely used behavioral test of memory that does not rely on food reward (radial arm maze) or survival instincts (Morris water maze) but on rodents’ innate predisposition to explore novelty in the absence of external stimuli. It is a widely used test of nonspatial memory that can be configured to probe multiple aspects of memory [40] without inducing significant stress. Here, we used the basic two-object procedure due to its more common use in the recent literature [41,42,43].",7cd26f8e-ac4d-47b5-86ba-1b1730dc83cf
4,methods4,"  Preliminary pilot tests were conducted with a small group of mice (3–6) to confirm that mice spent at least 20 s with each object within the allotted 8 min and that there were no initial biases toward either object (discrimination index of approximately 0).  The two-object novel object recognition (NOR) was carried out in a round, plastic, open field arena with a diameter of 45.72 cm (18 in) and height of 60.96 cm (24 in) and recorded with a GoPro for later analysis with AnyMAZE software. The protocol consisted of one day of habituation (T0), one day of training (T1), and one day of testing (T2), with 24 h between each session. During habituation, mice were placed in the middle of the open arena and left to explore for 8 min. Once finished, mice were placed in a separate holding cage until their home cage was empty; at which point, they were returned. The arena was thoroughly cleaned between each mouse.",d368a372-d447-45b2-bfef-bf8ba47f2b39
5,methods5," On T1, two identical objects were placed in the arena, equidistant from the opposite wall. Mice were placed in the arena facing the opposite wall, equidistant from both objects to prevent directional biases upon release. Mice were left to navigate and interact with the identical objects for 8 min. Similar to habituation, mice were placed in a separate holding cage after the trial until their home cage was empty. On T2, one of the familiar objects (FO) was replaced with a novel object (NO). Again, mice were placed in the arena facing the opposite wall and left to explore the objects for 8 min.  Using AnyMAZE software, the amount of time mice spent with each object, defined as the time spent touching the object or within 2 cm facing the object, velocity, and distance traveled were measured. A discrimination index ((NO − FO)/(NO + FO) × 100) was calculated. Mice that did not reach a 20-s minimum of exploration for both objects in T1 within 8 min were excluded from the analysis.  2.3.",23dcf4ff-de26-43cf-a9f8-1505d8270893
6,methods6," Brain Slice Preparation  The methods used to prepare brain slices were similar to those described previously [44,45,46]. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane in a vapomatic chamber and subsequently decapitated via guillotine. Following decapitation, the brains were rapidly extracted and placed in ice-cold, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF)) containing 119 mM NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgSO4, and 10 mM glucose saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.4). Salts were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), Mallinckrodt-Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA), or Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) and dissolved in double-distilled water (ddH2O). A vibratome (Leica) was used to cut coronal hippocampal slices (350 μm) in ice-cold, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF).",43d5d8ec-1e38-4065-901e-a9318bbc1edd
7,methods7," The hippocampi were then dissected out and transferred to a holding chamber containing room temperature oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Here, the hippocampi were either set aside for mitochondrial respirometry or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for ATP quantification, Western blots, and other assays.  2.4. Mitochondrial Respirometry  Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates were determined at 37 °C from freshly isolated hippocampal tissue using the Oroboros O2K Oxygraph (Innsbruck, AUT) with MiR05 respiration buffer, as described previously [47]. Prior to loading in the O2K machine, the hippocampi were permeabilized in 0.05 mg/mL of saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) in MiR05 for 30 min at 4 °C. After the addition of hippocampi, the chambers were hyperoxygenated to ∼350 nmol/mL and shut. A stable baseline respiration rate was established, which took approximately 5 min.",2ac0084f-ff29-4caa-a63d-589785121b2a
8,methods8," Changes in the respiration rates were then determined following a substrate–uncoupler–inhibitor–titration protocol. The electron flow through complex I was supported by glutamate  +  malate (GM, 10 and 2 mM, respectively) to determine the leak oxygen consumption (oxygen consumption (OGM)). Following stabilization, ADP (2.5 Mm) was added to determine the oxygen consumption associated with oxidative phosphorylation (oxidative phosphorylation (OADP)). Succinate (S) was then added to support complex I and II electron flow into the Q-junction (OS). To maximize the electron transport capacity given these substrates, the chemical uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP) was added (0.05 Μm, OFCCP). The respiratory control ratio (respiratory control ratio (RCR)) and CII factor were determined by calculating the ratio of oxidative phosphorylation (OADP):oxygen consumption (OGM) and the difference between OS and oxidative phosphorylation (OADP), respectively.",6a20ba7b-e989-4bfe-8546-dcb06a070342
9,methods9,"  Samples were then collected and stored at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were measured via the BCA assay (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA), and the respiration rates were normalized to the protein concentration.  2.5. ATP Quantification  The ATP concentrations were quantified from hippocampal homogenates using an ATPLite Luminescence Assay kit (Perkin Elmer). Frozen hippocampi were thawed on ice and homogenized via sonication in approximately three volumes of ice-cold ATP-stabilizing buffer (PBS containing 20 mM glycine, 50 mM MgSO4, and 4 mM EDTA), similar to methods described previously [48]. Homogenates were diluted in ddH2O and were transferred to opaque, white, 96-well plates in volumes of 100 µL per well. The ATPLite protocol was then followed. ATPLite lysis buffer was added (50 µL) to each well, and the plates were agitated for 5 min at 700 rpm at room temperature. ATPLite substrate solution was then added (50 µL) to each well.",47ccc373-02da-430d-9f7f-2b5e0fec11ff
10,methods10," The plates were covered with aluminum foil, agitated for an additional 5 min at 700 rpm at room temperature, and dark-adapted for 10 min. Luminescence was subsequently measured with a Victor Nivo Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer), and the ATP concentration was normalized to the protein concentration via the BCA assay (Perkin Elmer).  2.6. Western Blot  Frozen hippocampi were thawed on ice and sonicated with RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors at a final concentration of 1% v/v each (P8340, P0044, Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentrations were determined via the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and the sample volumes were adjusted to load 20 µg of protein per lane. Sample buffer (4× Laemmli buffer, 10% beta mercaptoethanol) was added to each sample and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were resolved by SDS/PAGE (12%) at 70 V and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.",8cccfab4-42e1-4a2f-9098-66027f4871ae
11,methods11," The membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk dissolved in 1× tris-buffered saline with 0.1% tween (tris buffered saline with 0 1% tween (TBST)) for 30 min and incubated with primary antibodies diluted to their final concentrations in 5% BSA, 0.02% sodium azide (see Table 2 for primary antibody information and dilutions) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed with tris buffered saline with 0 1% tween (TBST) and incubated with fluorescently labeled donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (LI-COR) at a 1:2500 dilution at room temperature for one hour. Membranes were washed with tris buffered saline with 0 1% tween (TBST) and imaged on a LI-COR Odyssey CLx. Target protein fluorescence was normalized to the loading control (β-actin) fluorescence. Target protein: β-actin ratios were compared between the control rodent diet (CON) and ketogenic (KETO) groups.  2.7. Statistics  Data are presented as the means ±SEM.",219e0478-e769-45eb-be82-4dc602b41bc6
12,methods12," Differences between the control rodent diet (CON) and ketogenic (KETO) means were compared using Student’s t-tests (GraphPad Prism; Microsoft Excel). The Shapiro–Wilk test was used in conjunction with the visual assessment of q–q norm plots to determine normality for all analyses. The significance was determined at p < 0.05.  2.8. Sex as a Biological Variable  The rodent estrous cycle lasts approximately 4–5 days, in which time 17β-estradiol levels gradually increase until proestrus, when 17β-estradiol quickly rises and falls. Circulating estradiol in the mouse is highest during the proestrus phase of the estrus cycle and has been shown to alter hippocampal physiology and cognition [49,50]. High estrogen during the proestrus phase of the cycle has been shown to enhance LTP [51], BDNF expression [52], and reduce Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [53]. To control for fluctuations in circulating estrogen, female estrus cycles were visually tracked.",c4b17c81-a2eb-42cb-a4a7-b99a010c7d33
13,methods13," The vaginal opening was evaluated based on the criteria described by Champlin et al. [54]. Mice underwent behavioral testing and sacrifice when mice were not in proestrus.  3. Results  3.1. Ketogenic Diet Elevates Blood Beta-Hydroxybutyrate  In the initial tests, male and female C57BL/6 mice placed on the ketogenic lard diet (BioServ F3666) alone displayed only mild elevations in blood ketone concentrations (data not shown). Supplementing the KD with 5% exogenous ketone ester (R,S-1,3-butanediol acetoacetate diester) displayed significantly higher levels (Figure 1A; week 0 p = 0.01, week 1 p < 0.001), week 2 p < 0.001, week 4 p < 0.001, and week 8 p < 0.001) of blood BHB and significantly lower levels of blood glucose (Figure 1B; week 0 p = 0.42, week 1 p = 0.016, week 2 p = 0.16, week 4 p = 0.001, and week 8 p = 0.015) compared to control rodent diet (CON) mice throughout diet conditioning.",d8749e70-2d2b-4420-b4f6-ddbcaec7bd4c
14,methods14," Despite these data, the weights were not significantly different between control rodent diet (CON) and ketogenic (KETO) mice (Figure 1C; week 0 p = 0.56, week 1 p = 0.16, week 2 p = 0.53, week 4 p = 0.48, and week 8 p = 0.54).  3.2. Ketogenic Diet Improves Recognition Memory and Locomotion  At the end of diet conditioning, control rodent diet (CON) and ketogenic (KETO) recognition memory was assessed in the novel object recognition test. During novel object recognition (NOR) testing (T2), ketogenic (KETO) mice spent significantly more time (Figure 2C; p < 0.001) with the novel compared to a familiar object. However, the discrimination index, a measure of the mouse’s ability to discriminate the novel from familiar object, indicated a trend toward significance (Figure 2B; p = 0.12).",8053bc42-8e6d-4be3-af62-f2548387177f
15,methods15," Measures of the average distance traveled and velocity indicated general increases in locomotion with the ketogenic (KETO) treatment, such that ketogenic (KETO) mice traveled significantly further (Figure 2D; p = 0.047) and strongly trended toward a significant increase in velocity (Figure 2E; p = 0.066) compared to control rodent diet (CON) mice.  3.3. Ketogenic Diet Enhances Hippocampal Mitochondrial Efficiency  High-resolution respirometry (Figure 3A,B) indicated that the ketogenic (KETO) diet significantly reduced the mitochondrial respiration rate of hippocampi with the addition of ADP (oxidative phosphorylation (OADP), p = 0.013). ADP sustains oxidative phosphorylation supported by the complex I-mediated electron flow. The ketogenic (KETO) diet also significantly reduced the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate with the addition of succinate (OS, p = 0.",0e0e6f3b-fd7c-440e-a2ac-cdde09059920
16,methods16,"044), which supports the complex II-mediated electron flow, and carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (OFCCP, p = 0.021), which induces the maximum oxygen flux due to uncoupling. A strong trend toward significance was observed with the addition of glutamate and malate (oxygen consumption (OGM), p = 0.053), which support complex I-mediated respiration associated with the proton leak. Representative traces of oxygen consumption with the addition of GM, ADP, S, and FCCP were plotted versus time in Figure 3B. The time at which O2 flux began to plateau was designated as time = 0. The plateau occurred within 5 min following the addition of hippocampi to the respiration chambers and directly prior to starting the SUIT protocol.  ATP quantification indicated no significant change in ATP concentration between the control rodent diet (CON) and ketogenic (KETO) hippocampi (Figure 3E; p = 0.42).",0be812e0-c24a-433c-a19f-cd28b29e8b8e
17,methods17," However, the ratio of ATP to oxygen consumed with the activation of oxidative phosphorylation (ATP:oxidative phosphorylation (OADP)) demonstrated improvements in mitochondrial coupling and efficiency (Figure 3F; p < 0.001). Additionally, ATP:OS demonstrated a significant improvement in mitochondrial efficiency (Figure 3F; p = 0.005). The ketogenic (KETO) ATP:oxidative phosphorylation (OADP) ratios were, on average, almost 20% higher (19.7%) than the control rodent diet (CON) ratios. On average, the ketogenic (KETO) ATP:OS ratios were almost 12% higher than the control rodent diet (CON) ratios. The respiratory control ratio (respiratory control ratio (RCR)), a general measure of the general mitochondrial fitness (Figure 3C), and the complex II factor (complex II factor (CIIF)), a measure of complex II’s contribution to the respiration rate (Figure 3D), indicated no significant differences between the control rodent diet (CON) and ketogenic (KETO) mice (p = 0.7, p =0.39).  3.4.",272fac2e-dc22-4e69-bb22-bc6e3708fa62
18,methods18," Ketogenic Diet Induces Sex-Specific Hippocampal Mitochondrial Complex V Expression  To determine whether changes in the mitochondrial respiration rates were due to changes in the expression of the mitochondrial complexes, Western blots were performed probing for complexes I–V. Together, male and female mice did not display any significant changes in the expression of the mitochondrial complexes (CI p = 0.28, CII p = 0.33, CIII p = 0.76, CIV p = 0.52, and CV p = 0.71). However, when compared separately, female mice on the ketogenic diet displayed a significant reduction in the expression of CV (Figure 4A,B; p = 0.001), while male mice did not (Figure 4C,D; p = 0.64).  3.5.",a1a58f95-365f-4e53-afa4-730932ffe482
19,methods19," Ketogenic Diet Does Not Alter the Expression of Hippocampal Mitochondrial Dynamics Proteins  To determine whether a ketogenic diet alters the expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics, Western blots were performed probing for DRP1, a mitochondrial fission protein, and OPA1, a mitochondrial fusion protein (Figure 5A). DRP1 expression was not significantly altered by ketogenic (KETO) conditioning (Figure 5B; p = 0.21). pDRP1 expression, expressed as pDRP1:DRP1, was similarly unaffected (Figure 5C; p = 0.36). OPA1 expression, however, exhibited a trend toward significance (Figure 5E; p = 0.11).  4. Discussion  The current study provides further evidence of metabolically relevant, neuroprotective effects of ketones within the brain, adding to a large body of evidence that suggests manipulating peripheral nutrient metabolism through diet can offer neuroprotection.",e8ea753f-7b61-4fbe-9793-79ac5cc62c9d
20,methods20," Our findings are consistent with previous studies utilizing KE-based diets that demonstrate improvements in behavioral anxiety and memory [55,56], as well as hippocampal metabolism [57]. Here, we assessed the effects of a novel ketone-supplemented ketogenic (KETO) diet on recognition memory and hippocampal bioenergetics in healthy adult mice and found that the diet improves cognitive function and mitochondrial efficiency.  At the inception of this study, C57BL/6 mice were initially placed on a control rodent chow (control rodent diet (CON), LabDiet 5001) or a lard-based KD alone (KD, Bioserv F3666). The control rodent diet (CON)-fed mice displayed elevated blood BHB levels similar to the KD-fed mice (Figure 1A; week 1, 0.47 mM). This was surprising, as we found little evidence of this in previously published reports on the topic. Although the KD significantly elevated the blood BHB levels compared to the control rodent diet (CON), the difference in blood concentration was minimal (~0.",cc58843d-9b8b-4cfd-844b-6fb0bc5e6ad0
21,methods21,"2 mM, data not shown) and, we deemed, not robust enough to justify using the KD alone to quantify the effects of ketones on hippocampal physiology. The KD lard-based diet was then supplemented with the ketone ester, R,S-1,3-butanediol acetoacetate diester, which further elevated the blood BHB (Figure 1A; week 1, 1.69 mM), allowing us to proceed with the study. These findings highlight the necessity of directly measuring blood BHB levels in rodent studies exploring the effects of ketones on physiology in the context of ketogenic diets. These findings also call attention to the innate differences in nutrient metabolism between humans and mice, such that mice have a basal metabolic rate per kg of body mass that is approximately seven time higher than humans [58] and, as we observed, have a greater predisposition to a ketogenic state without severe carbohydrate restriction (control rodent diet (CON) 57.9% carbohydrate, 13.4% fat, and 28.7% protein).",44c25841-4b0e-4bf1-8d4e-02c7759e15e0
22,methods22," These must be taken into consideration when evaluating the translational potential of ketogenic diet research in mice and other model organisms.  We observed ketogenic (KETO)-induced improvements in behavioral recognition memory (Figure 2) that were accompanied by enhancements in the hippocampal mitochondrial efficiency (Figure 3). High-resolution respirometry revealed that, with the addition of glutamate, malate, ADP, and succinate, which induce CI and CII electron flow into the Q junction, the ketogenic (KETO) diet significantly reduced the oxygen flux (Figure 3A) but maintained the same concentration of ATP as the control rodent diet (CON) diet (Figure 3D). In other words, the ketogenic (KETO) diet significantly improved mitochondrial efficiency within the hippocampus or ATP produced per unit of oxygen consumed (Figure 3E).",6a9fba99-ab1a-4016-99a6-ef26d5d1c456
23,methods23," We also observed a significant reduction in oxygen consumption with glutamate, malate, and ADP addition or complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) contribution to oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 3E). Paired with the unchanged ATP concentrations, this also produced a significantly higher rate of ATP:O2, which suggests that both complex I and II (succinate–coenzyme Q reductase) are likely involved in the ketogenic (KETO)-induced improvements in mitochondrial efficiency. Overall, these data indicate that hippocampal mitochondrial respiration is more tightly coupled to ATP production under prolonged ketogenic (KETO) compared to control rodent diet (CON) exposure.  This oxygen-sparing effect has implications for the conditions of cerebral hypoxia, for example, traumatic brain injury (traumatic brain injury (TBI)), stroke, and other forms of ischemia in which the blood oxygen supply to the brain is occluded.",8219e05d-800a-40fd-8850-3eefcb238e66
24,methods24," The hippocampus has been demonstrated as particularly vulnerable to hypoxic stress and is one of the first brain regions to display degeneration [59,60]. Rats placed on a KD after a controlled cortical impact injury have demonstrated a decrease in cortical contusion volume and a reduction in cortical and hippocampal neurodegeneration [61]. Other studies have explored the effect of ketogenic diets on traumatic brain injury (TBI) and have demonstrated that the diet has protective effects against apoptosis and delays traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced deficits in energy metabolism in juvenile rats [62,63]. The results presented here suggest a potential additional mechanism: ketogenic (KETO)-induced oxygen sparing may promote cell survival by extending oxygen supply. This is especially impactful, because clinical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of the KD as a treatment for traumatic brain injury (TBI) are ongoing (NCT03982602).",9d89ae43-f518-4ae6-ad5f-247647c869f1
25,methods25,"  Mitochondria are incompletely coupled, meaning during oxidative phosphorylation, some of the redox energy is dissipated rather than coupled to ATP production. This occurs as a regulated process via uncoupling protons but also occurs as an unregulated background proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane (inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM)). Proton leak-associated oxygen consumption exhibited a very strong trend (p = 0.053) toward significant reduction in the ketogenic (KETO) hippocampus compared to the control rodent diet (CON). Glutamate and malate feed into the malate–aspartate shuttle, which transports NADH-reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix, where they have access to mitochondrial complex I. In the absence of ADP, this activates a non-phosphorylated respiratory state in which oxygen consumption is associated with a proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) back into the matrix [64].",9c103476-6616-44d5-91a6-987aa3d41b27
26,methods26," Although not the only means of uncoupling, a proton leak is the primary mechanism that uncouples mitochondrial oxygen consumption from ATP production [65]. Increased proton conductance (leak) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) has been theorized to minimize oxidative damage at the expense of compromising energy homeostasis [66]. However, these data suggest that the ketogenic (KETO) diet decrease the hippocampal proton leak without compromising energy production. While we did not quantify the expression of uncoupling proteins, the strong trend toward reduction in proton leak-associated oxygen consumption with the ketogenic (KETO) treatment indicated less leak-associated uncoupling. This is consistent with our ATP data, in which we observed a significant increase in the ATP:O2 ratio and tighter bioenergetic coupling (Figure 3E).  Proton permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) is susceptible to modulation, which can result in fluctuations in uncoupling.",f31c3f0b-9c16-4a9b-9080-97c52c58f1a5
27,methods27," This includes physical changes in the lipid composition and structure of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) lipid bilayer and the presence or absence of uncoupling proteins [67,68]. For example, hyperthyroidism in rats has been shown to increase liver inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) proton permeability. This occurs via thyroid hormone-induced changes in the phospholipid bilayer components that increased the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) surface area [69]. Environmental factors such as temperature and diet have also been shown to alter the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) lipid composition in rodents and other organisms and, consequently, ATP:O2 ratios and animal performance [70]. Therefore, although we did not assess this directly, it is possible that the ketogenic (KETO) diet we used in this study altered the hippocampal inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) lipid composition to decrease the proton leak and improve the mitochondrial efficiency.",abfccf1b-f7a0-4267-81ab-fffab4c3cdc9
28,methods28,"  Oxidative damage is one of the hallmarks of brain aging [2] and is a well-established driver of cognitive decline [71,72] and neurodegenerative disease [73,74]. Mitochondria are a significant source of Reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is due to their role in oxidative phosphorylation in which molecular oxygen is reduced to water by complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase) of the electron transport system. Within the mitochondria, complexes I and III (ubiquinol–cytochrome c reductase) are the primary sites of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [75]. Although we did not directly quantify the Reactive oxygen species (ROS), it is possible the ketogenic (KETO) treatment also decreased the Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production due to a reduced mitochondrial O2 flux and improved the energy efficiency. This would be consistent with the literature demonstrating ketones reduce oxidative stress [76,77,78] but would require further testing.",d3b17202-0712-4cd9-baf3-634f9aa49c0d
29,methods29,"  In this study, the novel object recognition test was selected as an indicator of cognitive function. The hippocampal formation is organized in a way to support memory storage and recall. Following exposure to a stimulus (for example, the visual stimulus of an object), the hippocampus must determine whether the information is novel and requires encoding as a new memory or old and requires retrieval of a previously encoded memory. These rely on hippocampus-dependent processes of pattern completion and separation. Pattern completion, the ability to retrieve whole memories (neural representations) from partial or noisy cues, is dependent on CA3 recurrent collaterals, while pattern separation, the process of distinguishing similar experiences by minimizing overlap in neural representations, is dependent on mossy fiber inputs to CA3 [79].",2e78b059-e259-4b2a-aabd-cddd425fb9d6
30,methods30," Together, the significant increase in time with the NO combined with the trend toward significance in the increased discrimination index (Figure 2B,C) indicated ketogenic (KETO)-induced improvement in recognition memory, which requires both pattern separation and completion. Although we did not distinguish changes in the bioenergetics in dentate gyrus granule cells from CA3 pyramidal neurons, here, we display general enhancements in the hippocampal bioenergetic efficiency that correlate with improvements in the recognition memory (Figure 2 and Figure 3).  More generally, the ability to recognize stimuli that have been previously experienced relies on recollection of the stimulus in the context of its original exposure and general familiarity with aspects of the stimulus.",debdde30-4447-463a-91f9-0c224e94da38
31,methods31," Historically, recollection and familiarity have been thought to be anatomically distinct processes, whereby recollection is mediated by the hippocampus and familiarity is mediated by the surrounding perirhinal cortex [80,81]. However, more recent evidence suggests the hippocampus is necessary for both [82,83,84]. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of senescence-related dementia, affecting approximately 6.5 million individuals in the United States and approximately 55 million globally. AD is characterized by neurodegeneration that progressively impairs cognition and behavior. Research suggests that both recollection and familiarity are affected in AD patients—recollection at all stages and familiarity at the later stages of disease progression [85,86].",1d4e2bdc-0bce-4f2f-a7e7-f125b8973546
32,methods32," Although we did not assess the effects of the ketogenic (KETO) diet on recognition memory in a mouse model of AD, the results presented here suggest that ketones may be therapeutic due to their ability to improve recognition via hippocampal mitochondrial function.  In the novel object recognition (NOR), we also observed a significant increase in distance traveled and a trend toward a significant increase in the relative velocity (Figure 2D,E) that indicated ketogenic (KETO) treatment also enhanced the locomotion. Combined, these cognitive and locomotive data agree with previous research demonstrating a KD enhances the physical and cognitive performance in rats [87].  A recent RNA-seq study showed that a 90-day KD induced changes in the metabolic gene expression in neurons isolated from whole brain homogenates [88]. Researchers found that the KD increased the expression of oxidative phosphorylation-related genes in neurons but not astrocytes.",218b866f-1d72-4c45-b689-6dbda7b2cd9a
33,methods33," They speculated that the upregulated expression of mitochondrial complex genes would likely cause an increase in oxygen consumption to enhance oxidative phosphorylation. In our study, we observed the opposite—a reduction in mitochondrial oxygen consumption—with the stimulation of mitochondrial complexes I–V (Figure 3A), and no change in the expression of the complexes themselves, with the exception of complex V in the female mice (Figure 4). We determined this difference in female mice may be a female-specific effect independent of circulating 17β-estradiol, as we accounted for estrogen via visually tracking the estrus cycle.  While it could be easy to label the results presented here as conflicting, there are several differences that must be accounted for. The current study assessed hippocampus-specific physiology, while the RNA-seq study analyzed whole brain homogenates and isolated neurons and astrocytes.",0ae3eddd-2dfa-4a88-b96e-b6afdc832221
34,methods34," Since we used hippocampal homogenates, it is possible that the expression of neuronal mitochondrial complexes was, in fact, increased with ketogenic (KETO) treatment. However, our data is limited to hippocampal homogenates, making it impossible to distinguish neuronal versus astrocytic gene expression.  More generally, the brain is a heterogenous organ, containing substantial populations of glial cells that support neuronal activity. In addition to their functions in the blood–brain barrier permeability, myelin production, and immune function, glial cells—notably, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes—play central roles in brain energy metabolism. They provide aerobic glycolysis-derived lactate to neurons, especially during periods of high synaptic activity [89]. Although it was historically believed that glia occurred in the brain at a high 10:1 glia:neuron ratio, more recent evidence suggests a global ratio closer to 1:1 [90], which also varies by brain region [91].",694a4361-3523-46cb-beca-9b2b347a26c1
35,methods35," As a substantial proportion of cells are in the brain, it is worthwhile to note that we did not assess the contributions of specific glial populations to the results presented here. While they likely contributed to the significant changes we observed in mitochondrial efficiency and behavior, further study will be required to elucidate their specific contributions.  Mitochondria are remarkably dynamic organelles that vary in size, number, and location to meet the local energetic demands. Variations in the mitochondria size and number are mediated by processes of fission and fusion. The balance of fission and fusion have effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics, such that mitochondrial fusion is generally associated with an increase in mitochondrial efficiency and fission with a decrease in efficiency [92], and is, therefore, tightly regulated.",da31d63e-3d62-4e52-8134-1fd035e00008
36,methods36," Due to this, we explored the effects of the ketogenic (KETO) diet on the expression of DRP1, a protein involved in mitochondrial fission, and OPA1, a protein involved in fusion. Here, we demonstrate no significant change in DRP1 or OPA1 expression, despite a significant increase in mitochondrial efficiency with ketogenic (KETO) treatment. While we did not visualize the mitochondria directly, together, these suggest that the improvement in energy efficiency within the hippocampus occurred independent of changes in the mitochondrial dynamics.  Similar to other research investigating the effects of ketogenic diets on physiology, it is difficult to parse out whether the observed effects were due to carbohydrate restriction, the direct effects of the ketones themselves, or both.",904872bb-d6e3-47e1-8eaf-6c30d1eebd70
37,methods37," Additionally, because the caloric intake was not directly quantified and compared between control rodent diet (CON) and ketogenic (KETO) mice, it is possible that some effects—for example, the significant reduction in blood glucose—were due to reduced food consumption rather than the direct effects of the ketogenic (KETO) diet. However, the lack of significant changes in body weight throughout the ketogenic (KETO) treatment argued against this. In total, these data confirmed that environmental factors, such as diet, can induce variations in mitochondrial efficiency [70] and that changes in efficiency can alter animal performances.  While age-related cognitive decline is a normal symptom of nonpathological aging, the dramatic rise in obesity over the last 50 years has proven to not only increase the risk of developing diseases with clear metabolic underpinnings such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease but also exacerbate cognitive aging [93,94].",4bd8727e-fc21-4e0d-aefe-e84d51e8cd2f
38,methods38," In recent decades, it has become clearer that peripheral metabolic dysfunction has serious implications for brain health and cognitive function, as insulin resistance and its comorbidities significantly increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias later in life [95,96,97,98]. Identifying ways to reduce the cognitive burden of obesity and protect against the development of dementias will be essential to public health, as trends in AD parallel those of obesity continue to rise.  Compensating for brain energy deficits is a core feature of metabolic strategies to delay the onset and slow the progression of a number of neurodegenerative diseases and brain disorders. Ketones have been suggested as therapeutic due to their ability to directly fuel the brain despite aging and disease-induced impairments in cerebral glucose metabolism [99,100] and are currently being explored in clinical settings (NCT04701957, NCT03935854, etc.).",a2499d83-3c84-4b63-9e8a-d5bf890f6fc6
39,methods39," The data presented here suggest that ketones may also reduce the brain energy deficit by improving the mitochondrial fuel efficiency within the hippocampus, and represent a plausible strategy for protecting cognitive health in adulthood.  5. Conclusions  Ketogenic diets are metabolically and cognitively relevant in healthy adult mice and may be an effective strategy for protecting against cognitive decline associated with aging and disease.
