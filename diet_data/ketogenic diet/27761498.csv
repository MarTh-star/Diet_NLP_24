0,introduction0," Ketogenic Diet and Disorders of The Nervous System A diet high in fat, low in carbohydrate and sufficient in protein will automatically shift the dependency of energy production in the body from primarily glucose to primarily ketone bodies and is termed a “ketogenic diet” (KD; Branco et al., 2016; Masino, 2017). This dietary approach was developed nearly 100 years ago as metabolic therapy to mimic the metabolic changes that occur during fasting after observing that upon halting food intake, seizures would stop in epileptic people. The KD is well-established as a treatment for epileptic seizures and variations of the diet can be used in children and adults and can be more effective than medication in stopping seizures (Pulford, 1927; Neal et al., 2008). The KD can also prevent seizure progression (epileptogenesis) in animal models and patients (Muller-Schwarze et al., 1999; Neal et al., 2008; Lusardi et al., 2015).",8240e232-906f-439c-8d8f-76ff5b4f65da
1,introduction1," Some patients become seizure-free, and remain so even after diet cessation (Martinez et al., 2007; Patel et al., 2010; Caraballo et al., 2011). These lasting outcomes are likely to rely on epigenetic changes (Boison, 2017).  Metabolic dysfunction is increasingly appreciated as a fundamental pathology across disease states (Zhu and Chu, 2010; García-Escudero et al., 2013; Pathak et al., 2013). In models of neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic therapy with a KD or analogous ketone-enhancing metabolic strategies have beneficial effects in cultured neurons, animal models, and in patients. The ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) protected cultured dopaminergic substantia nigra cells from N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) toxicity and hippocampal neurons from amyloid β toxicity , and improved the disease rating score in Parkinsonian patients .",06f9d9bf-1e86-49a3-a5fe-e04000dda463
2,introduction2," In vivo and in vitro administration of ketone esters reduced histological and biochemical pathologies and improved cognition, anxiety and motor performance in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (Liu et al., 2011; Hui et al., 2012; Brownlow et al., 2013; Kashiwaya et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013; Pawlosky et al., 2017). KD improved memory of patients with mild cognitive impairment , and administration of a ketone ester or medium chain triglycerides (often a component of ketogenic treatment) enhanced memory and cognition in Alzheimer’s patients (Reger et al., 2004; Newport et al., 2015; Cunnane et al., 2016). Treatment with a KD suppressed inflammation and improved motor disabilities in a multiple sclerosis model , altered disease progression and improved motor performance and neuronal survival in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis model (Zhao et al.",3a5158f3-d8b6-464a-aa16-0a6ec555f937
3,introduction3,", 2006), decreased the expression of apoptotic mediators in a traumatic brain injury model , and improved motor outcomes in a spinal cord injury model .  It is becoming apparent that beneficial effects of ketogenic therapy extend beyond epilepsy, neurodegenerative disorders, and brain/spinal cord injury. The KD is broadly effective in improving core behavioral symptoms in animal models of autism spectrum disorder (Ruskin et al., 2013b, 2017a,b; Ahn et al., 2014; Verpeut et al., 2016; Castro et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2017), and in autistic patients (Evangeliou et al., 2003; Masino et al., 2011b; Spilioti et al., 2013). The KD is receiving growing interest in oncology as tumors are highly glucose-dependent (the Warburg effect; Seyfried and Mukherjee, 2005; Zuccoli et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2011; Klement et al., 2016; Lussier et al., 2016; Khodadadi et al., 2017).",99d722ee-0941-4263-a068-b98f1c9d4cef
4,introduction4," Also, due to the high efficiency of metabolizing fat when carbohydrates are minimal , the KD has been promoted for weight reduction (Jenkins et al., 2009; Partsalaki et al., 2012; Paoli, 2014; Gomez-Arbelaez et al., 2017) and for treatment or reversal of type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome (Yancy et al., 2005; Volek et al., 2008, 2009; Westman et al., 2008; Hussain et al., 2012; Tay et al., 2015; McKenzie et al., 2017).  In addition, healthy, disease-free cells and animals can also benefit from this therapy. The use of ketone bodies as an energy source appears to be associated with a healthier metabolic phenotype that renders cells more resistant to external insults. Ketogenic treatment decreased myocardial damage after ischemic injury, reduced lung injury after hemorrhagic shock, enhanced kidney resistance to oxidative stress, and protected neurons against glutamate-induced toxicity (Zou et al., 2002; Koustova et al., 2003; Noh et al., 2006; Shimazu et al.",e926f7b1-103a-4c18-ae21-26c56c86c4ba
5,introduction5,", 2013). At the cognitive level, beneficial effects on learning and memory were reported . KD in mice started at 8 weeks of age did not affect longevity ; however, KD started midlife extends longevity and healthspan .  Mechanisms of Ketogenic Therapy: Evidence for Increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the anti-seizure and neuroprotective effects of the diet, such as enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis , decreased formation of reactive oxygen radicals , altered transmitter levels and ion channel function (Schwartzkroin, 1999; Bough and Rho, 2007), increased adenosine (Masino et al., 2011a; Masino and Rho, 2012), and decreased DNA methylation .",41aea8e7-01e1-487b-b847-a9f86e30ec71
6,introduction6," Each one of these mechanisms could account for some of the beneficial effects of the ketogenic therapy. However, to date fundamental metabolic mechanism(s) which could explain diverse beneficial effects across numerous diseases have yet to be confirmed. If uncovered, such mechanism(s) could provide a fundamental answer to “how does the KD work?”—a lingering question and a topic of intense resurgent research efforts and clinical interest. A unifying mechanism of action could also serve as a target for the development of therapeutics that enhance cellular and metabolic health and provide the metabolic resilience necessary to prevent and combat neurological diseases.  Glucose and ketone bodies are used to provide energy in the form of ATP. Many tissues in the body—such as muscle tissues—can oxidize fatty acids to produce energy.",7d0345ed-4de4-43af-98c8-36552ba37c71
7,introduction7," As one exception, in the central nervous system ketolysis is expected to be the primary pathway of energy production: neurons and oligodendrocytes have a limited capacity for mitochondrial fatty acid β oxidation (Edmond, 1992; Achanta and Rae, 2017). The ketone bodies acetoacetate (AcAc) and β-OHB are therefore the main energy source in the brain during ketosis, and the metabolism of glucose versus ketone bodies results in a differential reduction rate of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)), an essential metabolic coenzyme and signaling molecule.",40658e6e-0eba-434d-9524-ad4e193befa4
8,introduction8," nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) exists in oxidized and reduced forms, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H, respectively, and whereas both glucose and ketone pathways each produce two molecules of acetyl-CoA, glucose reduces four molecules of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ and ketone bodies reduce either one (β-OHB), or none (AcAc) during acetyl-CoA synthesis (Lodish et al., 2000; Cotter et al., 2013; Figure 1). A decreased reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ in the brain would be expected to result in increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio, with more oxidized molecules available for bioenergetic demands.  Figure 1 Schematic of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ consumption during metabolism of glucose vs. ketone bodies.",d7cba2f1-7de9-4d9d-8bfb-d84c4fea254d
9,introduction9," Both glucose and ketone bodies lead to the formation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA which subsequently enter the citric acid cycle and participate in energy production. Although glucose provides a higher final yield of ATP, the consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ is significantly higher in this pathway (4:1). Glucose will reduce 111 molecules of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ per 1000 molecules of ATP made, while ketone bodies reduce only 41 to produce a comparable amount of ATP. Decreased use of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ by ketone bodies in energy production pathways could increase the amount of free nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ available as substrate for enzymes and cellular signaling processes.",c6fe3039-de02-428a-b889-5683a2249f47
10,introduction10,"  Increasing the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio has multiple important implications: improved bioavailability of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ molecules has been linked to anti-aging (Scheibye-Knudsen et al., 2014), longevity (van der Veer et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2016) and other potentially beneficial effects. For example, an increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio was found to enhance mitochondrial function and protect against oxidative stress, and diverse research has shown that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) molecules play an important role in cellular respiration, mitochondrial biogenesis and redox reactions (Yang and Sauve, 2016).",b98ad8ee-1c57-4425-9477-cf005f191bad
11,introduction11," nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ also serves as substrate for enzymes affecting cellular functions ranging from gene expression to post-translational protein modifications, such as deacetylation and ADP-ribosylation .  We propose that the decreased reduction rate of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H during ketone-based metabolism increases availability of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ and thus alters the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio. This would occur during sufficient exogenous ketone administration or during fasting or adhering to a KD, i.e., when ketones are used as a main source of energy.",e3b0025a-ee35-4e24-a70c-3ec82e099701
12,introduction12," Considering the pivotal role of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ in cellular health, and that differential nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) reduction is inherent in this metabolic pathway, we suggest that this differential rate of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ reduction (and thus an increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ availability) is a primary mechanism of ketogenic therapy: increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ can potentially be the starting point for many of the diverse benefits of this metabolic treatment.  Ketogenic Diet-Induced Increase in Brain nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H Ratio Is Rapid, Persistent and Region Specific As an initial test of this hypothesis, we quantified and compared KD-induced changes in blood ketones and in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of normal adult rats.",d05367e8-6ec4-487b-ae72-d8ec98e0cd40
13,introduction13," Sprague-Dawley male rats (Trinity College, age 9–14 weeks, n = 20) were fed ad libitum either a standard chow diet (CD; Purina 5001; PharmaServ, Framingham, MA, USA), or a 6:1 [fat: (protein + carbohydrates); #F3666; Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ, USA] KD for 2 days or 3 weeks. Analysis of trunk serum collected showed that a KD induced a significant increase in ketone bodies (β-OHB; the primary circulating ketone body; Figure 2A), consistent with previous experimental and clinical work (Nabbout et al., 2010; Ruskin et al., 2013a).

15,introduction15," A significant increase in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio was quantified in hippocampi obtained from animals fed KD for 2 days (2d KD; n = 3) compared to animals maintained on control diet (CD; n = 5; P < 0.0001). All comparisons were unpaired t-tests. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. **P < 0.005; ****P < 0.0001.  To begin to evaluate if, when and where alterations in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) occurred in brain during ketone-based metabolism we performed nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) analysis on two regions, hippocampus and frontal cortex, after either a 2 days or a 3 weeks KD treatment. Three weeks exposure has been demonstrated to impact behavior and neuronal excitability in diverse paradigms (Hori et al., 1997; Cullingford et al., 2002; Ruskin et al., 2009; Masino et al., 2011a). As demonstrated by ketone body levels (Figure 2A), metabolic changes were significant within 2 days.",49d87215-7dd4-402d-a43c-8cf2baa27da1
16,introduction16,"  Twenty milligram samples of tissue from each region were homogenized in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) extraction buffer, centrifuged and deproteinized using 10 kDa molecular cut-off filters. Analysis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) was performed using an enzymatic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H quantification kit (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Fractions of samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature for the detection of total nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (tnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)), while equal amounts were heated to 60°C for 30 min to decompose nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ and leave unaltered nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H. tnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H were quantified with a colorimetric measure.",0a64d904-d0b8-4f7c-bcee-46c0b61c87ba
17,introduction17," Values of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H were subtracted from tnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to calculate the amount of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ present in the samples.  After 3 weeks of treatment, extracted hippocampi showed a significant increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio in the KD-fed group compared to the CD-fed group (Figure 2B). Interestingly, no detectable changes in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratios were observed in frontal cortices of the same animals (Figure 2C).  Interestingly, a robust and similar increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio was already detectable in hippocampi after 2 days of KD treatment (Figure 2D). This result aligns with previous work (Nabbout et al., 2010; Ruskin et al.",8016280b-aecc-4956-b056-a342c897d317
18,introduction18,", 2013a) showing that metabolic changes are present within 2 days and further corroborates the evidence that ketone bodies increase nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ availability rapidly. Increases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratios were due to increases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H levels were not changed significantly by diet treatments (CD: 3.25 ± 0.32 pmol/μg proteins; 2 days: 2.58 ± 0.21; 3 weeks: 2.68 ± 0.21; not significant). The changes quantified in the hippocampus are consistent with the predicted metabolic consumption, as highlighted in the metabolic pathways (Figure 1).",d47412e5-8209-470f-af84-ed01a9117d81
19,introduction19,"  Perspective and Implications Consistent with our predictions we found clear evidence that metabolic therapy with a KD increases nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H, a mechanism that could compensate for metabolic dysregulation and serve as a common start-point for the diverse beneficial metabolic and mitochondrial effects obtained with ketogenic treatments (Bough and Rho, 2007; Masino and Geiger, 2008). As noted above, a comparison of the metabolic pathways of glucose and ketone bodies (Figure 1) suggests that the use of ketone bodies as main energy fuel requires fewer nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ molecules than glucose (by a factor of 4), which should lead to an increased cellular availability of this vital coenzyme.",8a59a226-2ff8-4515-971b-f1332a0b4009
20,introduction20," Interestingly, β-OHB or a ketone ester precursor show protective effects by counterbalancing the decrease in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio in cases of neurotoxicity , confirming the ability of β-OHB to modulate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H levels. Ketone ester treatment oxidizes the cytoplasmic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H couple in hippocampus and cortex in aged, affected Alzheimer’s disease model mice, and reverses an apparent overoxidation of the mitochondrial couple in the hippocampus . Thus this study and our study of the whole-cell couple suggest clear positive metabolic effects of ketolytic metabolism.  In general, the hippocampus has been described as a seizure gate (Heinemann et al.",d982fea4-dd76-4a25-be7c-7482ae934184
21,introduction21,", 1992) and it is one of the first brain regions to be affected in Alzheimer’s type dementia; cortical changes appear later in the disease (Braak and Braak, 1998). Unexpectedly, our data show that a KD increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H in the hippocampus but not in the cerebral cortex, indicating regional specificity at the time points sampled. It is possible that changes mobilized by a KD could be more rapid or pronounced in more metabolically active brain regions: the hippocampus displays a higher metabolic rate than the cerebral cortex . Related to this, an early decrease in metabolic rate of glucose in the hippocampus, but not in cerebral cortex, was detected in patients who received a postmortem diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease .",05a03140-8c1e-4221-ac74-f4eca0088494
22,introduction22," Because of its high metabolic rate and increased vulnerability to hypoxia, oxidative stress, and metabolic dysfunction, the hippocampus could benefit more—or more rapidly—than other regions from KD-induced metabolic changes, including increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ levels.  Rapid increases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio could partially explain the ability of a KD to stop seizures in many patients within a few days of KD treatment (Freeman and Vining, 1999). For example, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H molecules can modulate directly the opening of ion channels important for neuronal excitability, such as ATP-sensitive and voltage-gated potassium channels .",06de39fa-c23b-4f7a-80d8-050e7cb1e387
23,introduction23," Accordingly, a rapid decrease in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ availability and consequent effect on neuronal excitability should be expected upon discontinuation of treatment. Interestingly, 15% of refractory epileptic patients experienced a rapid recurrence of seizures after KD discontinuation ; others remain seizure-free. The differential response among patients to treatment cessation indicates the existence of multiple downstream mechanisms and epigenetic changes (Masino and Rho, 2012; Lusardi et al., 2015) implicated in seizure control. Upregulation of key ketogenic enzymes, mainly mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, after longer periods of ketogenic treatment  might also play a role in the maintenance of the beneficial effects even after discontinuation of the diet. More work is needed on downstream and lasting effects of metabolic therapy.",d3f9959c-af02-4355-8d88-236de651ab96
24,introduction24,"  Consistent with these reported effects, previous work showed that addition of ketone bodies also prevented the expected decrease in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio induced by toxic doses of calcium and in parallel decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), a major source of cellular oxidative stress ; oxidative stress is detrimental and linked to neuronal death and neurodegenerative diseases . Altering the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio can control the rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Kussmaul and Hirst, 2006) and impact downstream enzymatic levels and activities that regulate apoptosis and inflammation (Yeung et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2011).",066c5741-cf5b-4dcb-af6e-2156fbf65784
25,introduction25," Enhanced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H should thus decrease inflammation, an effect observed in KD treatment (Forsythe et al., 2008; Ruskin et al., 2009; Yang and Cheng, 2010; Dupuis et al., 2015; Nandivada et al., 2016). Overall, increasing the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio through a number of ketone-enhancing treatments should protect against oxidative stress and enhance mitochondrial and cellular health.  Regarding gene expression, consuming a KD has been found to impact expression patterns of genes modulating neuroinflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis such as cyclooxygenase, tumor necrosis factor-α, and insulin-like growth factor 1 .",afc096c9-d563-4531-bac2-2c7bf16266b2
26,introduction26," Although increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ cannot exert these effects directly, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ can impact gene expression through the action of sirtuin enzymes. Increasing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ availability or the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio can increase the activity of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent SIRT1 enzyme (the most abundant member of the sirtuin family; Landry et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2008). The main function of SIRT1 is deacetylation of targets that regulate apoptosis and transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and the tumor suppressor protein p53 .",352aed67-7598-4dd8-8401-43a2bf2a92bb
27,introduction27," Hence, some of the expected downstream consequences of increasing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ with ketogenic treatment are decreased cell death, inhibition of inflammation, and modulation of gene expression and epigenetic changes through activation of sirtuin enzymes .  Conclusion Here we outline the overall implications and evidence for a rapid and region-specific change in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H as a direct result of consuming a KD. We hypothesize this as a new and fundamental addition to potential key mechanisms underlying beneficial antiseizure, neuroprotective and disease-modifying effects of KD.",ad4590d1-c74c-4824-9829-083f5314894e
28,introduction28," Because nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ can modulate ion channels, enhance mitochondrial health, decrease oxidative stress, and impact gene expression, an increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ and/or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio is a mechanism that can account for several diverse (and seemingly-unrelated) effects of ketogenic therapy. Furthermore, benefits of increasing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ such as life-span extension and enhancing cellular health have long been documented , and pharmaceutical companies are currently manufacturing and selling supplements that contain nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ precursors such as nicotinamide or nicotinamide riboside in an attempt to increase endogenous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ levels and enhance metabolic resilience—an outcome that may also be achieved physiologically by ketogenic strategies.",ea8a5e4f-01f9-4f4d-9cad-0b876244cea4
29,introduction29,"  At this time more research is needed to further identify where and when ketogenic therapy increases the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio, and to delineate specific downstream effects. It is also important to ascertain if changes in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio are caused by changes in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H, as levels of these two redox molecules can also vary independently (Wilhelm and Hirrlinger, 2011). Regardless, diverse lines of evidence place nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ at the center of metabolic health and disease, and evidence from our work and others supports the hypothesis that increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ is a fundamental molecular mechanism of the KD.",88f3a171-abf9-42ad-92c0-e9ac7d2f5c8e
30,introduction30," Our findings also indicate the potential for a greater role for this metabolic therapy in areas with high metabolic demand and vulnerability to environmental insults and oxidative stress such as the hippocampus. Taken together, increasing brain nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ levels—either by consuming a KD or by other ketone-enhancing treatments—might serve as a rapid and enduring strategy to halt or even reverse disease progression.
