0,introduction0,"Epilepsy, despite having a large number of different treatments, is actually one of the diseases with poor control of epileptic seizures. This is because of the lack of understanding of epileptogenesis, seizure genesis, seizure spread, and seizure suppression (1). Approximately 30% of patients have refractory epilepsy, which means that adequate trials of at least two drug programs have failed (2, 3). Drug treatment is usually aimed at having a neuronal anti-glutamatergic effect or demands the actions of GABA; some anti-epileptics act on ion channels of calcium, sodium, or potassium, stabilizing the neuronal membranes and thus avoiding the synchronization and the propagation of abnormal discharges. An alternative to counteract epileptic seizures is surgery, but just a selected number of patients are candidates for this type of treatment. These are the many reasons why it is necessary to look for alternative therapies for seizure control (4).",a57d9eaf-6a5c-4938-a72f-22a7568fd244
1,introduction1,"  Neuronal activity is closely related to the metabolism of carbohydrates that influence neuronal excitability, which can become abnormal as it happens in epilepsy. Carbohydrates promote the production of fatty acids for the generation of ketone bodies. Animal experiments have provided evidence that the anticonvulsant effect of the ketogenic diet (KD) is mediated by acetone, which has shown efficacy in the treatment of epilepsy, though it is not the only mechanism described (5). Glucose is the main substrate for obtaining energy in adult brains. Approximately 63% of glucose supplies is estimated to be used to obtain energy in a 7-days-old rat's brain; this amount increases with age (6).  Since 1921, dietary therapies have been suggested to have an important role in epileptic seizure control, including infantile spasms, Doose syndrome, Rett syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, Dravet syndrome (7, 8), and other neurological diseases. Seizure control is obtained by different mechanisms.",148a2bac-95b6-46f7-afff-ee282163180e
2,introduction2," What they all have in common is an overall reduction in glucose levels, elevated free fatty acids, and ketone levels (9). Thus, dietary therapy may play a role in slowing down the progression of a specific disorder (10).  The Wnt signaling pathway is actively involved in glucose regulation pathways, especially by increasing glucose absorption in cortical neurons independently of the activation of target genes and the synaptic effect of Wnt (11). In recent years, attempts have been made to describe the participation of adenosine triphosphate (adenosine triphosphate (ATP))-sensitive potassium (Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP)) channels (Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels) as a convergent mechanism of the effect that restrictive diets provide, because of a reduction in glycolytic pathways and the increase of ketone bodies, and therefore a cellular excitability reduction by lowering cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and activating the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels.",e3812238-d2a5-47e3-8bb9-6eb7ea025002
3,introduction3," Therefore, the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels rather than closed by ketone bodies could be activated, generating an output of positive ions and decreasing neuronal excitability (12). The association of the neuronal excitability is gaining importance, which depends mostly on these Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels and the Wnt pathways, though a clear relationship with glycolytic pathways and their metabolic regulation remain to be clarified.  Therefore, the objective throughout this review is to describe the Wnt pathway as a regulator of the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels involved in the ketogenic diet and caloric restriction as well as to point out the possible genes involved in each of the diets and how they can molecularly achieve a reduction in epileptic seizures (Tables 1 and 2).",b070c355-79a9-4cba-8ec4-f3e5b888b0be

22,introduction22,"  Caloric Restriction Caloric restriction (CR) is described to be a natural dietary therapy that improves health, prolongs longevity, and reduces the effects of new inflammatory diseases in rodents and humans (77–79). CR occurs by partial dietary restriction and differs from acute fasting or starvation. CR reduces caloric energy consumption without causing eating disorders or any specific nutrient deficiency (80). In addition to improving health status, CR has anticonvulsant effects in murine and other epilepsy models (81, 82).  Moreover, it is proposed that the anti-epileptic action of CR may require a reduction in glucose or insulin concentrations and an increase in the β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) ketone body (83), along with increased fatty acid oxidation and reduced lipid accumulation in some tissues, as CR has been strongly related with improving insulin sensitivity and increasing adiponectin levels (84).",c488bdcc-a853-447c-8dc7-c3aa67016c0c

Also, CR in rats with epilepsy induction by the Kindling model increased the threshold after a stimulus applied to the amygdala and showed a decreased duration of epileptic activity (86). The abovementioned finding suggests that CR carries an anti-seizure profile and is completely independent of changes in glucose, insulin, or β-HB (82).  Talevi and Rocha (9) mention that CR may inhibit glycolysis and, just like the KD, is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and decreases oxidative stress and inflammation, but it appears that it does not have an ionic gradient effect on the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels.

After CR in rats, a reduction in the degeneration of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex was shown before the administration of kainic acid (88).  Physiological Effects of Caloric Restriction on Wnt/B-Catenin on the Brain New signaling pathways have been postulated on the effects of caloric restriction in the brain, one of them involving glycolytic metabolism in neurons, but little is known about the intervention of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (89, 90).

25,introduction25," In brain tissue, glucose is oxidized by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the product with the highest consumption by the neuron during the formation of the ionic gradient after synaptic transmission (91, 92).  The stimulation of cortical neurons with Wnt3a stimulates glucose absorption without significant changes in the expression and the functionality of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), but with an increase in its affinity. Furthermore, by stimulating the same ligand, the activity of two glycolysis regulatory enzymes (hexokinase enzyme and 6-phosphofruct-2-kinase/fructose-2,3-bisphosphatase) increases, as they are correlated directly with the increase in glucose absorption (11) (Figure 1). Besides the Wnt pathway, AKT participates in the glucose increase by inducing glycogen synthesis due to the inhibition of 3-kinase-glycogen synthase in rapamycin proteins (93, 94).",684e786b-bc21-48ec-9d42-902049d27a6b

Many of these proteins involved are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that having defects in Wnt signaling may also determine a metabolic change in the energy utilization of cells toward glycolysis and staying away from fatty acid oxidation (95). The intervention of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways in glycolytic pathways and their indirect role in the cell membrane activity of epileptic neurons are still not fully understood. Wnt signaling pathways are essential for the development and the function of the central nervous system because it modulates key processes such as hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptic cleft formation, and mitochondrial regulation (96, 97).

Wnt Pathways Wnt signals can be divided into two main pathways: the canonical pathway (β-catenin-dependent signaling pathway) and the non-canonical pathway (β-catenin-independent). The first has been implicated in leading the regulation of transcriptional activity and the activation of genes such as c-Myc, cyclin D, and the TCF/LEF (T-cell factor/lymphoid promoter-binding factor) pathway that determines cell fate such as determination, proliferation, and differentiation of stem cells.",51ff69c0-32d4-43e4-b5b0-325d033aba62
29,introduction29," The binding of a specific Wnt (such as Wnt1, Wnt10b, or Wnt3A) to their Fzd (Frizzled)-LRP5 or Fzd-LRP6 receptors results in the activation of intracellular heterotrimeric G proteins and Dvl (Disheveled) proteins, which in the dentate gyrus leads to phosphorylation and recruitment of Axin to LRP5 (or LRP6) and participating as a co-receptor (18, 19, 98). The abovementioned event leads to the dissociation of β-catenin and the degradation complex by promoting its stabilization and the accumulation of the molecule in the cytosol. Thus, it is translocated toward the nucleus and activates the transcription factors of the TCF/LEF families (21, 99), c-Myc, and cyclin D. Certain intracellular molecules expressed by Wnt-dependent activation of β-catenin jointly participate in the pyramidal cells of the region hippocampal CA1 and can increase the sensitivity to pentylenetetrazole and kainate by inducing seizures and cell death (100).",6be37e9d-2f35-4b89-b561-86eadc519113
30,introduction30," The opened Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to gene triggering, which increases mitochondrial production.

(102) reported that 10 repeated electroconvulsive seizures in the rat's brain exert a neuroprotective effect on the inhibition of c-Myc protein levels and subsequent inactivation of the Bad proapoptotic protein while allowing the activation of BclXL. However, the overexpression effect of β-catenin on c-Myc and cyclin D causes neuronal death in Purkinje cells and the granule layer of the cerebellum of rats with repeated generalized seizures. Activation of β-catenin can induce the overexpression of c-Myc and cyclin D that exert an apoptotic effect through positive regulation and activation of proapoptotic proteins (103).",567338c1-3656-4a25-85d6-cb56cb3ce1ad

This pathway alters intracellular Ca2+ activated by Wnt5a and simultaneously decreases potassium currents, leading to an increase in neuronal excitability, specifically in CA1 pyramidal neurons (107). The activation of Fzd receptors by its Wnt ligand induces the inhibition of the enzyme GSK3β, which generates the activation of tuberin protein (TSC2) (15). Without these signals, TSC2 inhibits the brain protein-enriched homologous Ras protein (Rheb), an activator of mTORC1 (108). Thus, inactivation of Rheb by TSC2 leads to the inhibition of mTORC1, and inhibition of TSC2 leads to the indirect activation of mTORC1.",02913132-0e9d-4228-9a78-f3371216f971

Furthermore, it reduces the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein (S6) and PKB/Akt in the neocortex and the hippocampus, suggesting that mild CR inhibits mTORC1 signaling pathways. Therefore, an effect of raising the discharge threshold potential has been pointed out, suggesting an anticonvulsant action (82).  Figure 2 The low glucose levels caused by caloric restriction induce an activation of the protein adenosine monophosphate (AMPK) (adenosine monophosphate-activated by protein kinase). It simultaneously causes activation of the tuberin complex that causes an indirect inhibition of the mTOR molecular complex by the Rheb protein (homologous Ras protein-enriched brain), a direct activator of mTOR.",3463b352-4e87-4e2e-a3f3-f7cde26bf080
33,introduction33,"  It is a fact that due to the glycolytic regulation of CR, this diet gets involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. We suggest that the resulting proteins of this pathway are part of seizure pathogenesis in experimental models, proposing that CR could help in seizure control through the proteins of the Wnt signaling pathway. Nevertheless, further research needs to be done to understand this mechanism and suggest a specific molecular/genetic target for therapeutic intervention.  The Effects of Caloric Restriction in the mTOR Signaling Pathway One of the Wnt functions is to increase gene expression through the transcriptional activity of β-catenin, as well as protein synthesis through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). However, their interaction is not completely understood. Caloric restriction reduces the epileptic activity inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway. This is a main pathophysiology component of epileptic seizure (109).",b90b980c-e366-4621-be37-58ea12c60732
34,introduction34," The hyperactivation of mTOR participates in epilepsy; the inhibition on this kinase results in beneficial anti-convulsive effects. It is related to cell proliferation, protein synthesis, cell survival, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and cell motility.  mTOR is divided into two complexes, mTORC1, implicated in cell growth and proliferation as well as metabolism, and mTORC2, involved in the regulation of protein kinases and the cytoskeletal elements of the cell (110). Mutations in the mTOR pathway are associated with dysplasias, epilepsy, and neurodevelopmental disorders like tuberous sclerosis complex, Cowden's syndrome, polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (111).  The TOR protein family plays a role in regulating mRNA transcription initiation and protein translation in response to intracellular concentrations of amino acids and other essential nutrients. The mTOR pathway is activated by ingestion, rising from blood glucose levels, which consequently increases insulin.",d3f755fa-94c5-49f6-8891-88c5237966a0
35,introduction35," Excess protein in the diet stimulates the mTOR pathway, phosphorylating the insulin receptor, among others, while generating more insulin, which can aggravate the Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the insulin receptor through mTORC1 activation. mTORC1 activation suppresses Wnt canonical pathway expression and regulates Fzd and Dvl for stem cell functioning and cellular homeostasis (112). As mentioned before, Wnt protein inhibits GSK3β through Fzd ligands, activating TSC2. When TSC2 is inhibited, it indirectly activates mTORC1 by supporting the relation between mTORC1 and Wnt pathways (15, 108).  This pathway responds to different extra- and intracellular cues. It also affects mitochondrial function. When mTOR is hyperactivated, it induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and eventually causes neuronal damage. A high level of adenosine monophosphate (AMPK) leads to mTOR pathway regulation.",7ff0de66-2aac-4747-a31f-c36052950511
36,introduction36," adenosine monophosphate (AMPK) is stimulated at low energy levels that later activate tuberin protein (encoded by tuberous sclerosis 2 gene, TSC2). Tuberin plus hamartin (encoded by TSC1) inhibits complex mTORC1 (113). Additionally, adenosine monophosphate (AMPK) removes insulin and growth factors, activating protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), which inhibits tuberin and activates mTORC1 (114). If there is an increase in mTOR cascade function, epilepsy also increases. Therefore, the inhibition of mTOR has shown anti-convulsive effects (115).  Diets such as the ketogenic diet and caloric restriction have shown anti-epileptic actions in several different animal models due to mTOR pathway inhibition.",376ad668-573b-41c0-b076-1a09cce430e0
37,introduction37," Among the anti-epileptic effects of CR found in epileptic inbred mice, delayed seizure onset and decreased seizure incidence are found (78), as well as increased paired-pulse inhibition, an increased threshold of maximal dentate gyrus activation, no spreading of depression-like events (116), delayed kindling rate in seizure-prone rats (85), and a maximization after-discharge threshold in electric kindling epilepsy model (82).  There is undoubtedly a physiologic connection of the Wnt and the mTOR signaling pathways that gives us a more profound understanding of the interplay between mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, more research needs to be done to conclude a novel therapeutic target.  Ketogenic Diet Although the different mechanisms of action in diets are not fully understood yet, the KD has shown a decrease in seizures in about 50% of the patients (50).",4e59f87d-efd6-491c-aceb-1a668e4b35d5
38,introduction38," About 50% of individuals treated with KD have reduced seizure frequency (117), even stopping seizures at all in 10–15% (118). Studies suggest that this relies on the production of ketone bodies that cause an effect on neuronal function and release of neurotransmitters, such as a decrease of glutamate and an increase of GABA synthesis.  On the other hand, it has not been set specifically which epileptic syndromes the KD could benefit, but its effectiveness has been proven in glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex, and a potential action in autoimmune epilepsy and encephalitis has been suggested due to the KD anti-inflammatory actions (119). Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency has been reported to have a beneficial response to the KD. However, the KD is not appropriate for some patients with conditions of primary carnitine deficiencies and β-oxidation defects due to the inability to metabolize ketone bodies (120).",0acc96d5-c33c-4d59-a95d-ea257790ac0f
39,introduction39," A small percentage of patients have adverse effects like gastrointestinal symptoms and high serum lipids in short-term studies, which do not allow them to follow the diet as a treatment, which suggests that genetic changes are involved (50, 117). Currently, there are different approaches to reduce the adverse effects of the KD (121).  Moreover, 15 years ago, research found 42 genes to be involved in intracellular metabolism and signal transduction pathways, specifically oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial protein metabolism expressed in different ways after KD treatment (122). Additionally, a reduction in seizures was demonstrated in 50% of a group of patients with epilepsy, with the potassium sodium-activated channel subfamily T after KD treatment (45).",e7d27418-6e09-4330-8815-7094d49283ae
40,introduction40,"  Neurotransmitters Involved in the Ketogenic Diet GABA For epilepsy, numerous pathologic pathways produce neuronal excitability resulting in seizures, including insufficient synaptic inhibition, and changes in the receptors like low GABAA (GABAA-Rs) levels in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus shown in kindled rats (123). Ketone bodies have multiple direct and indirect effects that modify neuronal excitability, intracellular metabolic changes, and modification in cell gene expression. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that the KD and CR enhance GABAA-Rs by increasing inhibition specifically in the dentate gyrus (116), a structure highly related to epileptic activity. The inhibition of glycolysis by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) has been observed to provide neuroprotective effects against seizures (124). Perhaps this inhibition provides a decrease in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/ADP ratio.",c1780100-a888-4c0b-a8b7-87c085634f85
41,introduction41," In 2013, Kossoff and Wang (125) mentioned that 2DG inhibition could prevent epileptic seizures by a different mechanism than the one presented by the KD since 2DG does not produce ketosis; however, it also increases GABAA-Rs at synaptic or membrane levels due to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (126).  Aspartate; Glutamate to GABA It is suggested that aspartate plays a significant role in hippocampal epileptogenesis since it is synthesized by glutamate when glucose is not available and functions as the excitatory amino acid that is released after depolarization, increasing its levels in the intra-synaptic space. The KD increases blood branched-chain amino acids, specifically high levels of leucine in the brain, which block the transamination of glutamate to aspartate (127). Another mechanism that supports the function of the KD in decreasing aspartate is the reduction of oxaloacetate, which is converted to aspartate through transamination reaction (128).",a621f45a-cf4b-440e-ad12-715f2fcbefb0
42,introduction42,"  Ketosis induces glutamate decarboxylase, causing fewer levels of glutamate and high levels of GABA (129), by some mechanism not yet understood. The KD response alters the glutamate–glutamine cycle by intensifying the astrocytic glutamine pathway extracting glutamate from the synaptic clefts and returning it to the presynaptic neuron as a GABA precursor (Figure 3). In 2010, Juge et al. (130) showed that ketone bodies, especially acetoacetate, competed reversibly for the chlorine (Cl−) binding site in the vesicular glutamate transporter, decreasing glutamate release, which had been available to glutamic acid decarboxylase for GABA synthesis in GABAergic neurons only (131).

43,introduction43," These effects are linked to changes in the amounts of neurotransmitters and influence membrane polarity. (B) The effects of certain products on ion transfer at the synapse. AR, adenosine receptor A1; ACA, acetoacetate; β-HB, beta-hydroxybutyrate; GAD, glutamate decarboxylase; GS, glutamine synthetase; GLNase, glutaminase; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive oxygen species.  Another possible mechanism may be due to an inhibition of the voltage-sensitive calcium channels enhanced by GABAergic function through GABAB-receptors after KD (132), causing greater stability among neurons in the hippocampus and control over transport proteins and Na+/K+-adenosine triphosphate (ATP)ase pump, causing ionic homeostasis for a more prolonged period than expected. It was demonstrated that, after KD therapy, there is a higher resistance to metabolic stress, raising the threshold to release larger amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (10).",0a819894-9140-456d-9162-b48374ebd6d8
44,introduction44,"  GABA, Glutamate, and Wnt Wnt 5a in the non-canonical calcium pathway causes higher levels of GABAA-Rs in the neuron surface by facilitating membrane insertion and increasing neuronal inhibition by regulating the synaptic plasticity of inhibitory circuits in the hippocampus (31, 133). When tyrosine-protein kinase receptor (receptor (RTK)) is expressed, the non-canonical pathway of Wnt increases intracellular calcium (Wnt/Ca2+ pathway), causing high levels of PKC and leading to regulate channel opening and NMDAR, a receptor for glutamate. Specifically, Wnt5a maintains a basal NMDAR synaptic transmission in calcium-dependent neurons, as shown in the CA1 of the hippocampus, and it has been described that SNAP25 peptide may play a role in this mechanism as well (107, 134).",65c8b20c-3088-4d4a-b8e3-82d7d491bb1f
45,introduction45,"  The Ketogenic Diet Modulates the Mitochondria, so Does Wnt Seizures and epileptogenesis cause the mitochondria to release reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), causing oxidative stress and cellular macromolecule dysfunction, affecting the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and mtDNA stability. Overall, this damage increases neuronal excitability. For instance, in temporal lobe epilepsy (temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)), mitochondrial dysfunction after oxidative stress is associated with excitotoxicity and apoptosis in the hippocampus (135, 136). How histological and functional modifications occur in the hippocampus in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) have been shown; some of these changes include neuronal loss in CA1 and CA3. In other types of epilepsy, gliosis and granule cell dispersion in dentate gyrus have been also demonstrated (137, 138).",5808ee4e-ae6a-4afe-a14b-029f55dec67d
46,introduction46,"  Studies have shown that the KD decreases the reactive oxygen species of the mitochondria of the hippocampus (139), one of the most vulnerable structures to the epileptic phenomena (140). In the hippocampus, the KD up-regulates genes involved in metabolic pathways and down-regulates genes implicated in intracellular signal transduction, resulting in an increase of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase beta subunit and its precursor and enhancing the brain adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production while maintaining the neuronal membranes in continued depolarization (42). Ketone bodies prevent cell death by activating the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels in the mitochondria (mitoKadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channel) by glycolytic reduction (141). Mitochondrial biogenesis has been proposed after a chronic ketosis state.",4472a997-96c7-4304-8319-ee21ec18c4d6
47,introduction47," The mitochondrial biogenesis allows an increase in the storage of phosphates, glutamate, and glutamine, resulting in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) increase. The Wnt signals activate mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive oxygen species generation, leading to cell damage (65). The Armcx groups of proteins have a bimodal subcellular localization, associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane; its overexpression produces mitochondrial alterations, demonstrating that this family of proteins plays an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and aggregation. These genes are expressed highly in the developing and adult nervous systems. Furthermore, higher levels of expression of Armcx3, which is part of the exclusive mammalian gene family, interacts with the Kinesin/Miro/Trak2 complex in a Ca2+-dependent manner, regulating mitochondrial dynamics and neuron trafficking.",6454afe6-5053-4ed7-8861-f59467a53b4b
48,introduction48," When the intracellular Ca2+ levels are depleted, there is also a degradation of Armcx3 through the Wnt signaling pathways, generating a mitochondrial aggregation effect reversed by the overexpression of Armcx3 and evaded by the activation of PKC. Therefore, the Wnt pathway can control mitochondrial dynamics by regulating Armcx proteins (142). The canonical pathway of Wnt did not alter the pattern of Armcx3-induced mitochondrial aggregation; it was also observed that the non-canonical pathway Wnt/PKC regulated both mitochondrial aggregation and Armcx3 protein levels; it was reduced with the activation of the non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, suggesting that Wnt regulates mitochondrial distribution and dynamics through degradation of the Armcx3 protein (40).  Many controversies are documented about complex enzymes; there is a general agreement on the decrease of complex I, which has shown mitochondrial dysfunction.",2f1f2035-daf0-42bd-b20f-4f53ded5cc7b
49,introduction49," However, others differ in the alteration of complexes II, III, and IV (136). After induced seizure, complexes I and IV of the mitochondria were decreased, and an increase of complex II provoked mitochondrial dysfunction due to oxidative stress, associated to a down-regulation in the encoded proteins for the electron transport chain, essential to membrane permeability, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, and the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), among other functions, resulting in a reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase, which continues a vicious cycle of producing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The KD could prevent mitochondrial complexes I, II, and III inhibition and increase uncoupling proteins (UCP2), reducing oxidative stress in the brain due to a decrease of free radicals and expressing antioxidant proteins that make the brain more resilient to oxidative stress (143).",c7fed522-8fdd-4978-8440-8fd7ec48f745
50,introduction50,"  After the KD, an enhancement of the mitochondria increases the glutathione (glutathione (GSH)) levels and biosynthesis in the hippocampus, contributing to a lower level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and improvement of mtDNA (144). The abovementioned condition is maintained by an increase of low levels of 4-hydroxy-2 non-enal, a product of lipid peroxidation, which leads to a protective transcription factor pathway involving Nrf2 protein, increasing glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis by gene transcription after the KD treatment (74).  Mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) is suggested to be the reason for cell death prevention due to the KD treatment after having been inhibited by oxidative stress. Ketone bodies act in a similar way to cyclosporine A, which can increase the threshold of calcium-induced mPT opening (145).",77e75ca5-160b-4999-ae76-60a534270285
51,introduction51," It also decreases brain pH, inhibiting proton-sensitive ion channels, while increasing monocarboxylic transporters (monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1, a protein that transports ketone bodies to the brain) (42).  Mechanisms of Action of the Ketogenic Diet and the Participation of Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) Channels in Neuronal Excitability In recent years, more and more research has been carried out on ion channels as responsible for the ketogenic effect of restrictive diets on neuronal membrane potential. The latest studies indicate that the KD modifies the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels' function.",a6d61c84-a486-4762-9b74-9554ed6f178b
52,introduction52," These channels are part of the metabolic state of the cell and the membrane potential due to their response and sensitivity to variations in concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP); therefore, the channels are inhibited by high concentrations of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and activated by ADP (146), causing variations in the membrane potential of the neuron by allowing variations of K+ ion conductance (Figure 4). In experimental models, evidence still suggests that the KD restores and increases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels (147–149). We suggest that the activation of Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels leads to this increase of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to provide its neural stability. These Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels are present in multiple neural areas. Regardless of being areas with glucose-sensitive function, it presents a high expressiveness specifically in the hippocampus (150–152).",564db2ad-72d1-49ae-b88e-afe507fb8491
53,introduction53," Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels of the neuronal membrane are inhibited in a basal state, except in states of severe metabolic deprivation (anoxia and ischemia), with both situations leading to cellular stress (153, 154).  Figure 4 Anticonvulsant effect of K+ channel-mediated ketone body metabolism. Ketone body metabolism increases overall adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but reduces glycolysis and glycolytic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. The reduction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) near the plasma membrane can disinhibit the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels and therefore reduce electrical activity. High electrical activity (as in a seizure) increases Na+ input and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) utilization near the plasma membrane. This produces negative changes in activity through the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels.",95b81fab-ca06-4b83-8f3c-ac505ef0e3cb
54,introduction54," The set point at which this negative feedback safety mechanism is activated is determined by the level of glycolytic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.  A study by Shen et al. in 2016, using dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, carried out a patch-clamp type registry, which showed the activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMPK) during the “whole cell” that caused a gradual increase of the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channel functionality and vice versa; the inhibition of adenosine monophosphate (AMPK) activity caused a decrease in Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels. In 2011, Ikematsu et al. (155) showed that adenosine monophosphate (AMPK) activation generated the function of voltage-regulated K+ channels (Kv2.1) by the phosphorylation of two channel sites (s440 and s537), inducing membrane hyperpolarization. This is important because adenosine monophosphate (AMPK) is essential for neuronal energy consumed after an epileptic seizure.",a4641c73-85b0-41a7-bb12-a922cc978761
55,introduction55," Besides that, a high level of adenosine monophosphate (AMPK) has been shown to up-regulate the Bcl2 modifying factor gene, preventing neuronal death in CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus induced by seizures (61).  The participation of Bad (BCL-2 cell death agonist) in neuronal metabolism has been mentioned, proven by its genetic deletion that generates a protective effect against epileptic seizures. Bad's genetic modifications decrease glycolytic metabolism, inducing a marked increase in activity in the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels (57). Bad ablation reduces the epileptiform activity of the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit in picrotoxin-induced epileptiform neurons (partial inhibitor of GABAA-Rs). Therefore, it confers a protective effect against seizures dependent on the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels' activity (58).  Tanner et al.",0bd98da4-14d6-4d2e-b77a-ee07e9ed165e
56,introduction56," (156) showed that bursts of stimulation in dentate nuclei neurons increase the probability of opening the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels through the administration of the ketone body R-β-hydroxybutyrate. They also found that neuron over-stimulation by triggering five action potentials by applying a current of 20 Hz in the same area caused a post-stimulation hyperpolarization mediated by the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels, suggesting the excitation limitation of seizure spread through the activation of Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels.  A study targeting substantia nigra pars reticularis (an area that participates in seizure activity) and ketone bodies observed reduction in neural excitability through Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels and GABA. Ketone bodies keep Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels open, which might increase the expression of the GABAB subunit (157).",609447e5-bacc-4995-a865-5296b7f76052
57,introduction57,"  An extracellular increase of K+ prevents the release of Ca2+, inhibiting the signaling of the Wnt pathway and the translocation of β-catenin to the cell nucleus. Wnt ligands hyperpolarized the cells by activating K+ current by Ca2+ (157). The Wnt response also depends on the activation of Bcl9 that activates genes that have response sequences to Wnt (158, 159).  Adenosine may play a relevant mechanism of the KD as a neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effect. Masino et al. (160) proposed the KD as metabolic stress that would cause a decrease in the enzyme adenosine kinase, an inhibitory regulator of adenosine, inducing its increase in the cell and activating its receptors, causing a tonic inhibition of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons through the adenosine receptor 1 (RA1) and conferring a protective effect against epileptic seizures. Moreover, adenosine has shown to increase seizures in experimental models and decrease DNA methylation, even after discontinuing the diet (161).",d1715c3d-6f42-429d-9e6b-15d2a1472302
58,introduction58," In experimental models, the KD has demonstrated to improve cerebral infarcts because of its association to increase extracellular adenosine levels, reduce volume infarcts, and boost regional cerebral blood flow, again by expressing the neuroprotective effect of the KD (162).  Conclusion The KD has shown a decrease in seizures through the production of ketone bodies that cause an effect on neuronal function and neurotransmitter release, such as a decrease of glutamate, enhanced mitochondrial function, an increase of GABA synthesis, and Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels' activation. On the other hand, CR may inhibit glycolysis and, like the KD, is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, a decrease of oxidative stress, and inflammation reduction. The KD and CR per se down-regulates and up-regulates certain genes involved in seizure activity.",3b95bd6d-84bd-4225-9fe0-946978c0c519
59,introduction59," There is still not enough evidence, because of the limited number of studies and small sample sizes, to suggest a specific treatment related to these genes and the association with Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels to control epileptic seizures.

The molecular changes that intervene in the glycolytic metabolism of neurons are crucial in modulating the electrophysiological response to epileptic seizures. Understanding the metabolic pathways interfering with the functionality of the Kadenosine triphosphate (ATP) channels in neurons with epileptiform crises is of great importance because the evidence shows that it could be introduced as a new pharmacological target for the new therapeutic generations being formulated for the modification of these metabolic pathways.",66c05109-4d12-47a0-8ed2-cfabfe2a6b9a
