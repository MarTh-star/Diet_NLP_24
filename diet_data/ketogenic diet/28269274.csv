6,results0," No randomized clinical trials were identified. Six studies (n = 39) met the eligibility criteria for this review – all were case series or reports and therefore at high risk of bias. All studies reported overall or progression-free survival; however the effectiveness of KD interventions could not be established. Dietary acceptability was not reported.  Conclusion: The effectiveness and acceptability of KDs in the management of gliomas is unknown and high quality randomized controlled trials are needed.  Keywords:  glioblastomagliomaketogenic dietsystematic review ==== Body Summary points This article systematically reviews the evidence for the effectiveness and acceptability of different ketogenic diets (KD) in the therapeutic management of patients with gliomas.  Six studies have been published since 1995, conducted in the USA and Europe (n = 39).  All studies are case series evidence, the lowest position in the evidence hierarchy.",6cebc878-8cd0-47e9-99ab-79f09db15013
7,results1," However, at present this is the only evidence available to inform decisions regarding the implementation of KDs for gliomas.  Minimal adverse events were reported, suggesting KDs to be safe in this population.  The evidence for effectiveness and acceptability of various KDs is insufficient to suggest they have a therapeutic effect in the management of gliomas; therefore further high-quality research is needed.  Key areas for future research include:A pragmatic feasibility study to inform future randomized control trials (RCT) design.  High quality randomized control trials to determine if KDs are effective in the management of glioma.  A health economic assessment to establish efficiency, clinical effectiveness and value of the intervention.     Description of the condition Primary brain tumors affect 7.14 per 100,000 of the worldwide population each year [1], with gliomas being the commonest form of malignant brain tumor, affecting three to five people per 100,000 each year [2].",11f85e0c-09a8-4325-b718-f6482dc94d1a
8,results2," Despite current treatment options including surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, these tumors remain incurable and the prognosis is poor.  Description of the intervention Warburg first recognized that tumor cells rely on glucose for energy in 1926 [3]. Over the decades the Warburg theory has been developed further, leading to the hypothesis that switching gliomas’ energy source from glucose to ketones may result in cancer cell death [4]. One mechanism for achieving this is by targeting tumor energy metabolism with the ketogenic diet (KD); a high fat, low carbohydrate diet, which results in the production of ketones as a primary energy source, while minimizing glycolysis through glucose restriction [5].  KDs are perceived as unpalatable and their assessment in patients with poor survival outcomes has therefore been limited.",54922951-3ab9-40d0-af59-dd76bef2c3c3
9,results3," However, following the success of the classic 4:1 KD (4 g fat for 1 g of carbohydrate and protein combined, ∼90% total energy from fat) in pediatric epilepsy, dietary variants have been developed that are designed to be more palatable and easier to implement, with fewer side effects [6].  Why this review is important? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the antitumor effects of KD in mice demonstrated a prolonged survival for the KD groups compared with standard diet (mean survival time ratio = 0.85 [95% highest density interval = 0.73, 0.97]; hazard ratio = 0.55 [95% highest posterior density interval = 0.26, 0.87]) [7]. To our knowledge, no such review exists for human studies and a review of the best current evidence is required to inform decisions about service provision and the design of future clinical trials.

After removing duplicates, 1713 records remained. Following the screening of titles and abstracts, 19 remained eligible for inclusion. These studies underwent a full text review, following which a further 13 studies were excluded due to inappropriate interventions [10,11], inappropriate populations [7,12–15] and inappropriate outcome measures [16–20].

23,discussion0,"Summary of main results This systematic review identified no high quality prospective studies assessing KD for glioma, but did identify a number of small randomized controlled trials that are currently ongoing. All six published case series included in this review reported overall or PFS; however due to the limited sample sizes (ranging from one to twenty participants) and the absence of a control group, it is not possible to make any conclusion as to the effectiveness of the KD interventions.  Adverse events were consistent across the majority of studies, predominately being weight loss and raised cholesterol. However, two studies adopted an energy restricted KD, following which weight loss would be expected [24,25]. The significance and clinical impact of weight loss would need to be considered and could be managed through nonenergy restricted, nonfasting regimes supported by a trained dietitian [26].",2de171c8-c73d-4950-895b-53eb1b31017d
24,discussion1," The impact of KD on cholesterol profiles should also be considered within the context of a disease that has poor long-term survival. While two studies reported an increase in cholesterol [24,26], one study, conflictingly reported cholesterol to reduce over the course of the diet [22]; therefore requires further investigation.  Retention rates on diet varied from 50 to 100%, however only three studies utilized a study protocol with predetermined duration for the dietary intervention [22,24,26]. As sample sizes of these studies range from 2 to 20 participants, the external validity of such data is questionable. No studies reported quality of life or dietary acceptability using the appropriate objective or subjective measures and are therefore subject to performance bias. Future studies should consider the inclusion of validated measures to assess quality of life and dietary acceptability.",4fffa406-cb1c-4526-910a-e87f43bfadcf
25,discussion2,"  Dietary compliance was inconsistently measured, with two studies citing the presence of serum ketones as a marker of compliance [24,26], and one study using self-reported measures [22]. Both methods have their limitations; including selection bias with eligibility criteria requiring patients to be compliant with the diet prior to recruitment [24] and reporter bias from self-reported measures [22]. Due to diverse methodologies, it is not possible to determine which diet is easier for participants to comply with.  A trend for the decrease in serum glucose levels, while adhering to a KD, can be noted across the studies, with glucocorticoids having a negative impact on levels. However, the clinical impact of this cannot be determined from the results of the studies so far. Five studies measured ketones in either urine or serum; however due to different methods no comparisons can be made between diets.",47e5eebf-241f-4f66-83c1-ccaddc8d7e69
26,discussion3,"  This review also identified 12 ongoing studies, five of which are randomized control trials (randomized control trials (RCT)). Three randomized control trials (RCT)s may be suitable for future meta-analysis [28–29,31]. These studies have comparable populations, outcome measures, control groups and similar dietary interventions, but further dietary and methodological details would be required to assess the appropriateness of such an analysis. The planned recruitment figures remain small and the trials are underpowered to demonstrate effectiveness. A multicenter randomized control trials (RCT) or the ability to undertake a meta-analysis is required.  Potential biases in the review process Thorough database searches were performed to identify studies suitable for this review. Application of the eligibility criteria to the research results identified six studies for inclusion. Given the relative novelty of KD in gliomas, a low number of editorials were expected.",aacaf22a-d94b-4457-a0a0-d970d679d6e6
27,discussion4," As the search strategy was first piloted and the results of the search strategy supplemented by hand searches, it is unlikely that relevant studies were missed, further confirmed through contact with an expert in the field. Therefore conclusions drawn from the review are based upon all available evidence.  A key strength of this review lies in the quality assessment of included studies. The Institute of Health Economics (IHE; Canada) Case Series Quality Appraisal Checklist [9] is the only validated quality appraisal tool for assessing the methodological quality of case series [9,39]. The tool was updated to include assessor annotations specific to this review as recommended by the authors of the tool [9], to aid the quality appraisal process. The tool does not provide a scoring system in which study quality may be distinguished as high or low, therefore it was not possible to strictly assess the confidence of cumulative evidence. As such, a narrative approach was taken in this review.",5e77516f-ef84-465e-8513-5bf5fc38e5d0
28,discussion5," No studies fulfilled the full study design criteria of the quality assessment tool.  Three studies utilized a study protocol enabling the repetition of their methods [22,24,26]. Of these, one study author [24] provided the trial protocol and there appeared to be no suggestion of selective reporting bias.  One study included a retrospective control group [21], however failed to statistically or descriptively compare the control group to the dietary intervention group. The control group was also unlikely to represent the population due to convenience sampling methods and eligibility criteria requiring variables not held within the records, thus creating selection bias. Therefore, this study design was also considered a case series.  A meta-analysis was not undertaken due to the heterogeneity of the study populations, methods, outcomes and bias stated previous. The overall measure of treatment effect would be misleading given studies were not powered to determine treatment effect.",38ffd6c4-bb34-4b65-a2da-f646230524ef
29,discussion6," Study populations varied from newly diagnosed grade III or IV gliomas to recurrent gliomas and the KD was administered at different time points in the treatment pathway. Participants also received a wide variety of oncology treatments while following KD. The KD interventions also varied, in terms of energy and carbohydrate restrictions, and types of dietary fats included. One study included fermented yoghurts and plant oils in addition to KD [22], therefore presenting difficulties when comparing KD outcomes. Ongoing studies may provide better quality data and synergy between protocols to allow for meta-analysis in future reviews.  Implications for practice & research Due to the lack of high quality evidence it is difficult to justify the use of KDs in a clinical, nonresearch setting. Further research is required to explore dietary acceptability, cost effectiveness and clinical effectiveness, prior to implementation alongside the current standard of care in this population.",ae2ae20b-367b-4e50-9cb9-404a12d55c8e
30,discussion7,"  Key areas for future research include: A pragmatic feasibility study to inform future randomized control trials (RCT) design; with outcomes related to adverse events, retention rates, quality of life, dietary acceptability, tolerability and compliance, using validated measures, as adopted by the KEATING study [32].  Determining if KDs are effective in the management of glioma, through high quality randomized control trials (RCT)s. It will be important to consider which KD, if any, is beneficial and at what point in the treatment pathway. KD concurrent to chemoradiotherapy in animal models has proven to potentiate the treatment effects; however, this is yet to be replicated within glioblastoma patients. Testing clinical effectiveness for median OS, in a newly diagnosed glioblastoma population, would require approximately 600 participants and is therefore unlikely to be achieved. It may be practical to power studies to PFS or OS at 6 months to enable attainable recruitment figures.",926f601b-43d2-41e7-a264-c85a5b9699d9
31,discussion8,"  A health economic assessment to establish efficiency, clinical effectiveness and value of the intervention, would be beneficial. Establishing quality adjusted life years would be of benefit to assess disease burden, in terms of quality and quantity of life gained by patients, if at all any.     Conclusion This review is based on case series evidence, the lowest position in the evidence hierarchy. However, at present this is the only evidence available to inform decisions regarding the implementation of KDs for gliomas. While the review has found minimal adverse events, suggesting KDs to be safe in this population, the evidence for effectiveness and acceptability of various KDs is insufficient to suggest they have a therapeutic effect in the management of gliomas. Further high-quality research would be of benefit.  Future perspective Over the next 5 to 10 years we may see the field of KDs in gliomas expanding, following the publication of current ongoing studies.",097ad20d-65ef-4dc8-8112-c01eab8a4233
32,discussion9," There will be the opportunity for meta-analysis presenting more robust evidence on the subject. However, it may be several years before large scale, randomized control trials (RCT) evidence is published exploring the effectiveness of KDs in gliomas.
