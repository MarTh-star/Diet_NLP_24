0,introduction0,"Microglia and macrophages are innate immune responders to infection, tissue damage, and other stressors. The early phase of this response involves release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, and metalloproteinases, along with alterations in cell morphology and surface protein expression1, 2. Although these responses are adaptive in the setting of infection, they can be deleterious in non-infectious injuries such as stroke and head trauma. Accordingly, factors that suppress the acute inflammatory reaction also reduce tissue loss and improve functional outcomes in animal models of non-infectious brain injury3, 4.  Inflammatory responses are influenced at the transcriptional level by factors that affect cellular bioenergetic state, such as caloric restriction, ketogenic diet, and the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG)5, 6.",30d6ab80-6a79-48a1-a55e-99d324784a62
1,introduction1," Caloric restriction, ketogenic diet, and 2DG each produce a ketogenic state in which glucose utilization is suppressed, and these conditions also reduce brain inflammation, tissue loss, and functional impairment after brain injury7–12. Conversely, hypoxia and hyperglycemia promote glucose utilization, exacerbate inflammation, and worsen outcomes after brain injury13, 14.  How inflammation affects cell metabolism is well established15, but less is known about how energy metabolism affects inflammatory responses. One potential mechanism is through the cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio, which is thermodynamically coupled to glycolysis. The cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio is decreased by ketogenic factors such as dietary restriction and 2DG, which decrease flux through glycolysis, and increased by conditions such as hypoxia and hyperglycemia, which increase flux through glycolysis.",81eee2d9-1047-4c8d-8d82-aa37e1f8fd95
2,introduction2," Cytosolic NADH and NAD+ are physically separated from the mitochondrial metabolite pools, but can move freely across the nuclear membrane to influence transcriptional events.  Despite the fundamental roles of NAD+ and NADH in cell metabolism, only a limited number of NADH-sensitive proteins are known to affect gene transcription16. Among these are the C-terminal binding proteins (CtBP), which function as transcriptional corepressors. Mammals express two CtBP proteins, CtBP1 and CtBP2, that exhibit overlapping actions17, 18. CtBP forms repressor complexes with histone deacetylases, histone methyl transferases, E3 ligases, and other transcriptional regulators19, 20. Some of these complexes include CtBP homodimers or heterodimers, while others require CtBP in its monomeric form21–24. CtBP in its monomeric form suppresses the activity of the acetyltransferase p300/CBP20, which acetylates both histones and the pro-inflammatory transcription factor, NF-κB25.",b3ebcef9-2bc1-4e51-93b7-cc3e26b1f41f
3,introduction3," Increased NADH levels promote the formation of CtBP dimers and higher order oligomers, and thereby modulate CtBP association with its binding partners26.  Here, we investigate whether anti-inflammatory effects of ketogenic metabolism may be mediated through an NADH/CtBP signaling mechanism. We show that changes in cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio influence inflammatory responses by regulating NF-κB transcriptional activity through a mechanism requiring CtBP dimerization. This process involves dissociation of p300 from CtBP and acetylation of the NF-κB p65 subunit. ",27ad6d5a-7cee-4eaa-bef1-7a345086e134

22,results0,"Microglial and macrophage activation is suppressed by 2DG The reduced glycolytic flux resulting from caloric restriction and ketogenic diet can be mimicked by the glycolytic inhibitor 2DG27, 28. To determine whether 2DG can replicate the effect of ketogenic diet on brain inflammatory responses, we treated rats with intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + 2DG. The systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection induced a robust activation of brain microglia, and this was strikingly reduced by co-administration of 2DG (Fig. 1a). In organotypic brain slice cultures (Fig. 1b), 2DG likewise suppressed the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on microglial activation and on the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), a hallmark of inflammatory activation in microglia and macrophages29. Primary microglial cultures similarly showed an attenuated response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence of 2DG (Fig.",b79b9c46-7540-412c-836d-46c182ae74f0

RAW264.7 cells were used because, unlike primary microglia, they can be efficiently transfected and are not readily activated by transfection procedures. Glutamine was provided as an alternative energy substrate in all of the in vitro studies, as glutamine is taken up by cells and metabolized to the keto acid, α-ketoglutarate.

As expected, both 2DG and glucose-free medium reduced the lactate:pyruvate ratio (indicating a reduced free cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio), while the respiratory inhibitors antimycin A and cobalt chloride (CoCl2)27, 32 increased it (Fig. 2b). We then evaluated these treatments on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced iNOS expression. Glucose-free medium suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced iNOS expression to an extent comparable to that seen with 2DG, while CoCl2 had the opposite effect (Fig. 2c). These findings identify a correlation between changes in the inflammatory response and changes in the NADH:NAD+ ratio in response to metabolic factors.Fig. 2 Relationships between glucose metabolism and cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio.",02d55afb-546a-4527-9e8d-481ead91a263

In contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of the M2-type anti-inflammatory gene, Socs3 (Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3)38, was unaffected by CtBP peptide, demonstrating that the peptide does not exert a global or nonspecific effect on transcription (Fig. 7e, f).  p300 binding to CtBP and pro-inflammatory gene promoters One way that CtBP regulates gene transcription is through interactions with the histone acetyltransferase HDAC119.",7b703154-4c24-4dbe-b8a0-ec2dd78a7e85

Both HDAC1 binding and H3 acetylation were increased in cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but neither was reversed by 2DG (Fig. 8a). A second way that CtBP regulates gene transcription is by repressing the activity of p30020, 39, which acetylates and thereby promotes the activity of transcription factors such as the p65 subunit of NF-κB25. The ChIP studies showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced p65 binding to the IL-6 promotor, and that this was completely reversed in the presence of 2DG (Fig. 8a).

Our present findings demonstrate that CtBP similarly couples metabolic state to the innate inflammatory response. We show that the pro-inflammatory gene expression and NF-κB transcriptional activity induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are coupled to glucose metabolism by the cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio, and that this coupling is attenuated by CtBP downregulation, by forced elevation of NADH, by transfection with an NADH—insensitive CtBP, and by a synthetic peptide that blocks NADH-induced CtBP dimerization. We additionally show that metabolic state influences CtBP binding to the acetyltransferase p300, p300 binding at pro-inflammatory gene promoter sites, and acetylation state of NF-κB.",4435cdcc-929e-45c2-a467-4ce81382e5b3
51,discussion1," The observations suggest a mechanism by which the liberation of CtBP from its dimerized form by lowered cytosolic NADH levels can suppress pro-inflammatory gene transcription.  The initial observation by Zhang et al.26 that NADH binding promotes CtBP dimerization suggested that CtBP could regulate transcription in response to metabolic changes. Subsequent studies confirmed that CtBP mediates effects of 2-deoxyglucose, hypoxia, pyruvate, and other metabolic influences on gene expression27, 41. Since NAD+ and NADH recognize the same binding site on CtBP, changes in the concentration of either nucleotide could, in principle, regulate CtBP interactions with its binding partners. However, the relative changes in NADH caused by shifts in the cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio are several hundred-fold greater than the reciprocal changes in NAD+ because the cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio is normally in the range of 1:70035.",74acf125-26f3-4118-b8b4-1ebf5b868b30
52,discussion2," The sensitivity of CtBP to changes in NADH thus makes it particularly responsive to changes in energy metabolism42. Inflammatory responses can also be modulated by NAD+—dependent deacetylases of the sirtuin family, notably Sirt143, but unlike CtBP sirtuins are not responsive to changes in NADH concentrations, and it remains uncertain whether their activity is significantly affected by the relatively small changes in NAD+ concentrations that result from changes in energy metabolism44.  CtBP1 and CtBP2 have nearly identical amino acid sequences and share the same NAD(H) binding site. CtBP1 lacks a putative nuclear localization signal, but may enter the nucleus as heterodimer with CtBP2 or other proteins22, 45 and may also interact in the extra-nuclear cytosol with binding partners such as p300 and HDAC1.

53,discussion3," Mice with combinations of CtBP1 and CtBP2 mutant alleles exhibit gene dosage-sensitive defects in several developmental processes17. Specific defects in immune function were not reported in these mutants, but CtBP has elsewhere been shown to modulate the role of estrogen receptors on inflammatory responses mediated by the AP-1 transcription factor, independent of metabolic changes46.  CtBP regulates gene transcription in multiple ways, including interactions with histone deacetylases, histone methyl transferases, E3 ligases, and the p300 acetyltransferase. We did not find changes in histone acetylation or HDAC1 binding at pro-inflammatory gene promoters in response to a ketogenic state, but did find decreased binding of p300 and decreased acetylation of p65, which is a substrate for p30025. Since p65 acetylation increases NF-κB transcriptional activity, these findings identify a mechanism by which metabolic effects on CtBP can modulate gene transcription.",28916b10-e636-4b90-b89b-0430cbf3e446
54,discussion4," However, both monomer and dimer forms of CtBP can affect gene transcription21–24, and our findings do not establish that p300/CtBP binding is essential for the observed effects of CtBP on pro-inflammatory gene transcription. CtBP2 could alternatively directly associate with p65 and suppress its acetylation by a mechanism independent of dimer/monomer transition or p300 inhibition47. Recent studies have also identified alternative ways that glucose metabolism can influence inflammatory responses, including effects on HDAC4 protein levels, NLRP3 inflammasome formation, and the activation of RAGE receptors48–50.  Cell cultures were used in our studies to facilitate manipulation of CtBP expression and cellular cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratios. A limitation cell cultures, and cell lines in particular, is a shift from respiratory ATP production toward more glycolytic ATP production (the Warburg effect51).",5210c76d-fa54-4f71-85f5-17db7699a151
55,discussion5," Moreover, the glucose concentration in standard culture media is saturating for glucose uptake and metabolism. As a consequence, basal glycolytic flux is typically much higher in culture preparations than in vivo. This may explain why relatively larger shifts in the cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio were observed with glycolytic inhibition than with respiratory inhibitors. However, the anti-inflammatory effects of 2DG in the cell culture preparations were also observed in vivo, as initially reported several decades ago6. Importantly, these results were also mimicked, both in vitro and in vivo, by the use of a novel synthetic peptide that inhibits NADH-induced CtBP dimerization.",7b9152e0-9ca7-4038-906d-0252169e3e9e
56,discussion6," This result agrees with the prior observation that native CtBP1 requires NADH to suppress p300 activity, whereas a mutant form of CtBP1 that cannot dimerize suppresses p300 independent of NADH20 It may be surprising that reduced CtBP expression did not itself lead to a super-induction of iNOS and related genes, given co-repressor actions of CtBP. However, a reduction in total CtBP does not necessarily produce a comparable reduction in nuclear monomeric CtBP.  Taken together, our findings indicate that metabolic influences that alter the cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio regulate NF-κB transcriptional activity through an NADH-dependent effect on CtBP dimerization. Conditions that reduce glycolytic flux, such as ketogenic diet and caloric restriction, can thereby suppress NF-κB activity, while conditions that increase glycolytic flux may increase it.",29848817-0f51-4815-906e-336a17c6772c
