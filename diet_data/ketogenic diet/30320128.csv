0,introduction0,"Ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low carbohydrate and normal protein diet, which is useful in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Across studies, it has been noted that 50% of patients on KD have >50% reduction in seizures and 10-20% become seizure-free [1]. It is a frequent clinical observation (personal experience and anecdotal) that after the first few months on KD, some patients experience a plateau in seizure reduction, and therefore, other therapies need to be considered. Often such patients wish to continue KD because of the seizure reduction and other benefits such as improved alertness, cognition, and behavior.  Although there has been much research in the last two decades on the clinical utility of the ketogenic and other similar diets, such as the modified Atkins and the low glycemic index diet, there has been little emphasis on the type of fat used in the diet except for the medium-chain triglyceride KD.",d5955d48-4c2e-4f1e-8f48-1d131d0f5717
1,introduction1," Traditionally saturated fats have been the prominent fat used [1]. There is limited clinical data on the use of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for the treatment of epilepsy. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the anticonvulsant action of PUFAs [2]. One of the possible mechanisms of action of KD could be related to omega-3 PUFAs which have been reported to be elevated in the plasma of children on the KD [3]. In vivo studies suggest that this is possibly due to a selective mobilization of PUFAs from adipose tissue or liver, with subsequent incorporation into the brain [4].  There have been a few clinical studies on the use of PUFAs (mostly as omega-3 PUFAs supplements) in epilepsy with conflicting results [5-8]. Also, there is a paucity of data on the type of PUFAs used, namely, omega-3 (n-3), omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids or docosahexenoic acid (docosahexenoic acid (DHA)), and the optimum n6:n3 ratio which might be effective in seizure control.",3392b71a-1d73-40b4-b511-64cc58434ce3
2,introduction2," We hypothesized that combining PUFAs with KD, i.e. using natural PUFAs rich oils as the fat source in KD might improve the anti-seizure efficacy of the KD. Therefore, this retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a change to PUFA-KD in those on mixed fats KD (MFKD) but with a plateau in seizure reduction. Seizure reduction, tolerability, and blood lipid levels were analyzed after the change to PUFA-KD and whether the n6:n3 ratio had any effect on these parameters.

3,methods0," The study evaluated the medical paper record forms of patients who had at least one seizure per week despite the use of mixed fats KD (MFKD). These patients were started on PUFA-KD and grouped according to the oils preferred. We analyzed the effect on seizure control, tolerability, blood lipids, and adverse effects and whether the type of seizures, age of seizure onset, age at which KD was started, and the ratio of omega 6: omega 3 (n6:n3) fatty acids had any effect on seizure control.  This retrospective, open-label study was conducted from April 2011 to March 2018 in a specialty ketogenic diet clinic in Mumbai, India. Persons who had reached a plateau in their seizure control with the mixed fats KD (MFKD), that is, the seizure frequency was at least one per week after a trial of mixed fats KD (MFKD) for at least 3 months, were selected.",4f848cbe-47f9-4598-9ce0-a79b7238bfa8
4,methods1," The mixed fats KD (MFKD) in our center is administered as a mixture of saturated, mono-unsaturated fatty acids (mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) and PUFAs [9]. This consists of ghee (clarified butter), butter and cream, groundnut or peanut oil and sunflower oil, delivering 25% saturated fats, 37.5 % mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and 37.5% PUFAs (21.37%, n-6 and 0%, n-3).  The patients were administered PUFA-KD, using the same KD ratio and calories as mixed fats KD (MFKD), but the fat used was PUFAs rich oils, namely, safflower oil, flaxseed oil, and sea cod oil. Safflower oil contains only n-6 PUFAs (linoleic acid). Flaxseed oil contains both n-3 (alpha-linolenic acid) and n-6 (linoleic acid) PUFAs. Sea cod oil contains only n-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) and docosahexenoic acid (DHA). The composition of these PUFAs oils used is shown in (Table 1).",22a88d7c-6d88-4aaf-8705-7c72ae8a9645

The proportion of the oils was specified and calculated by our dietitian team and given to the patients. Calories and KD ratio were maintained at the same level during PUFA-KD as on mixed fats KD (MFKD).  A daily seizure diary was maintained before the introduction of the mixed fats KD (MFKD) and during the entire period of the mixed fats KD (MFKD) and the PUFA-KD.

The effect of blood lipids was assessed of the three groups between baseline, mixed fats KD (MFKD), and PUFA-KD.  Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software and one-way repeated measures ANOVA to determine if there is significant seizure control on PUFA KD analyzing baseline, six and 12 months data of 50 subjects. Univariate analysis of variance was used to correlate the type of seizures, age of seizure onset, and age at which KD was started with seizure control at the end of 12 months.

The duration of the mixed fats KD (MFKD) ranged from 5 to 87 months (M = 23 months). They were on a median of three AEDs at the time of PUFA-KD initiation. There were 11 patients in Group 1, seven patients in Group 2, and 32 patients in Group 3.  Withdrawal from the PUFA-KD dietary treatment was seen in four patients and was due to non-compliance in two patients, non-compliance from the care-givers in one patient, and unsatisfactory seizure control in one patient. Non-compliance was due to the restrictiveness of the diet and the taste and odour of the fish oil. All four patients withdrew completely from KD. All patients maintained high urine ketones (>160 mg/dL) most of the period.    At six months on the PUFA-KD, 12% (six) were seizure free and 82% (41) had a >50% reduction in seizures (including seizure free).",1dbb705d-6a98-4ca8-a955-07578e78ff8b
12,results2," Results of the univariate analysis of variance showed mean seizure control at 12 months was highest in those with mixed seizures (M = 76.583, SD = 28.19064) followed by those with primary generalized (M = 67.2120 SD= 49.01852) and then for those with focal onset and secondary generalized seizures (M = 51.8538, SD = 110.98445). These differences between means were statistically not significant (F = 0.435, p = 0.650). Seizure control at 12 months was inversely correlated to the age of onset of epilepsy (r = -0.256) and also to age at initiation of KD (r = -0.259). The later the age of onset and later the age at initiation of KD, the lower the seizure control. However, these correlations were statistically non-significant (p = 0.073, p = 0.069, respectively).

17,discussion0,"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which the efficacy of using naturally occurring PUFA-KD in epilepsy has been trialed.  In our retrospective study, the change to a PUFA-KD from mixed fats KD (MFKD) resulted in a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency. Those who already had more than 90% reduction while on mixed fats KD (MFKD) did significantly better than those with less than 90% reduction. We used natural oils in which other PUFAs are also present instead of purified forms of docosahexenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).  We found efficacy with lower doses of docosahexenoic acid (DHA) (1.17 g/day to 4 g/day mean of 2.21 g/day) than the optimum dose mentioned by Taha et al [2]. Several studies mention conflicting ratios of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids which may be an important determinant of brain health.",9779b9e3-cae0-401b-b4e9-f80139fece4d
18,discussion1," Increased amounts of omega-6 in the diet leads to the production of larger quantities of eicosanoid metabolic products from arachidonic acid (AA) [9-10]. An imbalance of omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs in the peripheral blood causes an excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which causes increase in excitatory glutamate and mitochondrial dysfunction [11-12]. Omega-3 suppresses the production of cytokines and increases the production of GABA and mitochondrial biogenesis [2]. Omega‐6 and omega‐3 fatty acids are both known to compete for the desaturation enzymes. Both fatty acid desaturase 1 and fatty acid desaturase 2 prefer alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to linoleic acid (LA). Increased LA intake interferes with the desaturation and elongation of ALA. Thus a low ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids can inhibit the conversion of large amounts of LA [9-10]. The n6:n3 ratio recommended by Yoon et al in his study is 2.8:1, but in our study, it was a mean of 4:1 (Group 2) to a mean of 12.",d89b692c-cac4-4ffc-8ce9-6243159fc845
19,discussion2,"6:1 (Group 3) [13]. We had to use a higher ratio of n6:n3 since fish oil is expensive in India and most of our patients from lower socio-economic strata had financial constraints. All vegetarians because of religious constraints refused the fish oil while some non-vegetarians refused this due to its odour.  There was no statistically significant difference in the n6:n3 ratio in the responders versus the non-responders. docosahexenoic acid (DHA) did not seem essential as patients on n-6 PUFAs only (Group 1) and on n-6 PUFAs and n-3 PUFAs but without docosahexenoic acid (DHA) (Group 3) also had good seizure control, though the number of the patients in the groups was too small to allow statistical analysis. The use of docosahexenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is difficult due to our predominantly vegetarian population and also because of financial difficulties.  No serious side effects were seen in any of our patients.",cbb72de9-f293-492e-9ac0-0a89d347d639
20,discussion3," There was no significant abnormality in the blood lipid profile or other biochemical parameters in most patients. It was found that the mean cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) ratio levels of patients improved when the diet was changed to PUFA-KD as compared to baseline and while on mixed fats KD (MFKD). Tolerability of PUFA-KD was good and all those who left the diet did so due to an inadequate response, the restrictiveness of the diet and/or due to unacceptability of the taste of the fish oil.  Clinical trials on PUFAs supplementation in epilepsy have provided conflicting results [5-8, 14-15]. All these studies have evaluated the supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, namely, purified forms of docosahexenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).",08d61bdb-95b7-4684-8363-075429678598
21,discussion4," A recent Cochrane review concluded that in view of the limited number of studies and small sample sizes, there is not enough evidence to support the use of PUFAs supplementation in people with drug-resistant epilepsy [16]. There is limited data on the use of combined use of PUFAs with KD. Dahlin et al reported the effects on plasma fatty acids with omega 3 PUFAs supplementation in children on KD [17]. These children were supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids one month after the start of KD [17]. LA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were increased, whereas AA and mead acid (20:3 n-6: n-9) were decreased [17]. docosahexenoic acid (DHA) increased insignificantly. However, no correlation of changes in fatty acid levels with seizure response was found [17].",aa3a8c0e-4e98-49bf-8db5-ded986fed5c3
22,discussion5," Yoon et al reported a case of a 7-year-old boy with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome combined with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I deficiency, whose medically intractable seizures were successfully controlled with a PUFAs-enriched modified Atkins diet without any significant adverse events [13]. The diet consisted of canola oil and diverse menu items such as fish and nuts instead of olive oil and had a 1:2.8 ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 [13]. Schlanger et al conducted an open-label study where a fish oil spread was administered orally to provide 3.25g per day of n‐3 PUFAs (5g of the spread contained 46% docosahexenoic acid (DHA), 18% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 1% ALA). 16 patients out of 21 patients discontinued the study because of the “fishy” taste of the spread [5]. The five patients who completed the study, showed a significant reduction in seizure frequency (3 patients- 100 % seizure control and 2 patients- 78-99 % seizure control) after 6 months [5].",0f3d51e7-dc6d-4a54-ae03-76d3446d51bd
23,discussion6,"  In the above studies, the amount of docosahexenoic acid (DHA) used has been low (less than 3 grams/day) and the duration of the trials has been short. Taha et al. have suggested that docosahexenoic acid (DHA) should be used in higher quantities (3-6 gm/day) and for longer periods (3-6 months) to improve seizure control [2]. This could be because oral docosahexenoic acid (DHA) is trapped in the plasma chylomicron/low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) (low‐density lipoprotein) pools and does not increase in free form until a few weeks later when that pool is finally saturated. docosahexenoic acid (DHA) levels in the brain may be slow to increase even after unesterified docosahexenoic acid (DHA) is detected in the plasma because the half‐life of docosahexenoic acid (DHA) in the human brain is around 2.5 years [2].  Evidence from in vitro, in vivo and human studies supports the concept that PUFAs have anti-epileptic effects [2].",5e68ba81-84e5-4f6b-8963-4e73fee3c4d6
24,discussion7," PUFAs regulate the structure and function of neuronal membranes (raft and membrane-incorporated proteins) by maintaining the synaptic plasticity and fluidity of the lipid bilayer [18]. During epileptogenesis, the brain undergoes numerous changes including synaptic rearrangement and axonal sprouting, which require structural plasticity [19]. Fluidity and other parameters together with a hydrophobic thickness of bilayer have a prominent role in regulating many membrane functions, such as signal transduction, solute transport, and enzyme activity, associated with membranes [19]. Any alteration in lipid content due to lipid peroxidation leads to an imbalance in the distribution of inner and outer leaflets of the bilayer (asymmetry) and a decrease in fluidity [19].",a82995be-2569-4c97-bc87-0958a1019b35
25,discussion8," Increased oxidative stress and changes in antioxidant capacity leading to membrane lipid peroxidation by mitochondrial dysfunction and release of excitatory neurotransmitters are considered important in the pathogenesis of epileptic seizures [19]. There are differences in the rate of mitochondrial beta-oxidation depending on the structure of fatty acids [20]. The oxidation of ALA is twice that of LA or oleic acid [20]. Therefore, ALA and LA are the most ketogenic of fatty acids and enriching a high-fat diet with these increases its ketogenic potential [20].",b8b554a3-7099-4d24-8113-698387ca6582
26,discussion9," In vitro studies with n-3 PUFAs with ALA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexenoic acid (DHA) suggest several modes of action such as inhibitory effect on voltage-dependent sodium channels using docosahexenoic acid (DHA) and stabilization of neuronal membranes by suppressing voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels leading to an increase in action potential firing threshold and overall reduction in bursting in the hippocampus and neuronal excitability [21-24]. PUFAs may activate a lipid‐sensitive class of K2P potassium channels and also enhance the activity of the Na+/K+‐ATPase (sodium pump) [25]. PUFAs might indirectly induce the expression and activity of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) to diminish reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), reduce neuronal dysfunction and induce a neuroprotective effect [25].",2abbb308-b93f-4ea3-9327-d1d13fe2ce72
27,discussion10," PUFAs also activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα) that inhibit pro-inflammatory transcription factors thereby reducing inflammation which is a core contributor to seizures [25]. PPARα also induces a coordinated up‐regulation of energy transcripts leading to enhanced energy reserves and limited hyperexcitability [25]. Studies show that PUFAs also reduce oxidative stress by decreased activity of pro-apoptotic factors and inhibition of inflammatory mediators such as interleukins and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) [25]. eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) reduces inflammatory mediators by inhibiting phosphokinase A2 and cyclooxygenase-2 enzymes metabolized to anti-inflammatory series 3 prostaglandins, which is implicated in epilepsy [26]. In vivo studies also have provided proof of anticonvulsant efficacy of PUFAs [27-28]. Studies with n-6 PUFAs are few but AA has been found to inhibit sodium ion channels [29].",092cfc36-9575-4cfe-983a-728749db490d
28,discussion11," There have been studies that provide evidence that a lower dose of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) actually elevates membrane AA phospholipid concentrations in the neuronal membrane which is important for health in terms of cognition, longevity and cardiovascular health [30]. It was observed that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) administration produced clinical improvement in schizophrenia patients, but that improvement was greater at a dose of 2 g/day than at 4 g/day [30].  However, there are several drawbacks of this trial, including the retrospective nature of the trial and the lack of one standard intervention. This is because the caregivers and patients often refused certain oils due to religious beliefs, and/or unpleasant taste. In spite of these, this trial challenges certain concepts and gives a new form of KD which may prove superior to the classical KD.",08d8d6fc-7f19-446e-aedf-472451930f7f
29,discussion12,"  Conclusions PUFAs can be an important component of ketogenic diet to improve the efficacy of KD in those who have not achieved satisfactory control in seizures or have reached a plateau on mixed fats KD (MFKD). We found that both n-6 PUFAs and n-3 PUFAs rich oils were effective for seizure control. In future, randomized controlled trials will be needed to compare the efficacy of mixed fats KD (MFKD) versus PUFA-KD and determine the ideal ratio of n-6 PUFAs to n-3 PUFAs as well as the total amount of docosahexenoic acid (DHA) required. The PUFA-KD overall had good compliance, tolerability, and few side-effects. Cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) ratio levels significantly improved in patients on PUFA-KD as compared to baseline and while on mixed fats KD (MFKD).
