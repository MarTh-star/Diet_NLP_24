0,methods0,"2.1. Ethics Approval and Subject Recruitment and Consent Prior to initiating this study, the protocol was reviewed and approved by the Auburn University Institutional Review Board (approved protocol #: 16-031 MR 1603; IRB contact: irbadmin@auburn.edu) and was in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Twelve subjects were recruited from a local CrossFit gymnasium in the Auburn community to participate in the study. As inclusion criteria, we established that participants must have: (a) been active members at the gymnasium for at least three months; (b) been between the ages of 19–45; and (c) displayed a strength:mass ratio (determined via one-repetition maximum back squat) of at least 1.00.  2.2. Study Design A depiction of the study design is presented in Figure 1.",c34ff3ea-f93f-4676-85be-22220b50d8ba
1,methods1," Briefly, an initial meeting at the School of Kinesiology at Auburn University between study investigators and participants was held whereby all 12 participants were informed about the purpose of the study and the study design, and educated about the KD. Thereafter, participants were given a choice to participate in the KD group or continue their normal diet (continue their normal diet (CTL)). In an effort to optimize compliance with KD guidelines, participants who verbalized interest with adopting a KD for 12 weeks were placed in the KD group (n = 7), while others were placed in the continue their normal diet (CTL) group (n = 5). Participants then completed a screening and health history questionnaire to ensure inclusion criteria were met and that there were no risk factors that might be aggravated by maximal free-weight strength testing and aerobic testing (e.g., musculoskeletal injuries or exercise-induced asthma).",8539195d-5a39-46cb-903f-013633ceaf01
2,methods2," Participants were then told to maintain their pre-study diet and scheduled for baseline testing which commenced ~1 week following the initial meeting.  2.3. Body Composition, Metabolic, and Aerobic Performance Assessments During T1 (pre-test) and T3 (post-test) participants were instructed to arrive to the School of Kinesiology at Auburn University either in the morning or evening in a 4-h fasted state in order to best fit their work schedules; notably T1 and T3 time of day testing was similar for each participant. Upon arrival to the laboratory, participants submitted a urine sample (~5 mL) to assess for normal hydration specific gravity levels (1.005–1.020 ppm) using a handheld refractometer (ATAGO; Bellevue, WA, USA). Participants with a urine specific gravity ≥1.020 were asked to consume tap water every 15 min for 30 min and then were re-tested. Following hydration testing, height (T1 only) and body mass were assessed using a digital column scale (Seca 769; Seca, Chino, CA, USA).",b2c92e5d-6216-49a7-ae87-ea8130973eab
3,methods3," Next, participants were subjected to a full body dual X-ray absorptiometry (dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA)) scan while wearing general sports attire (i.e., athletic shorts or compression shorts and an athletic shirt) to assess various body composition characteristics. Notably, body segmentation for each scan was standardized prior to analyses by the same technician (Wesley C. Kephart), and total body lean mass and fat mass was assessed by the accompanying software. According to previous data published by our laboratory, the same-day reliability of the dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) during a test-calibrate-retest on 10 participants produced intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.998 for total body fat mass (mean difference between tests = 0.40 ± 0.05 kg), and 0.998 for total lean body mass (mean difference between tests = 0.29 ± 0.13 kg) [13].",92a3e0fc-b16f-418f-9b7d-f80523bb1c28
4,methods4,"  Following body composition assessments, resting energy expenditure (resting energy expenditure (REE)) and respiratory quotient (RQ) assessments were performed in a supine position over a 10-min period in a dark and quite laboratory space. Expired gases during the tests were continuously analyzed over the 10-min period using a TrueMax 2400 metabolic measurement system (ParvoMedics, Sandy, UT, USA) with a dilution pump which was used to set the fraction of end tidal CO2 (FECO2) between 0.90–1.10. All data were averaged in 1 min intervals, and the average of the last 5 min of the test was used for resting energy expenditure (REE) and RQ calculations.  Following resting energy expenditure (REE) assessments, participants donated a venous blood sample (described in greater detail below), and then performed VO2peak testing on a motorized treadmill (Waukesha, Woodway, WI, USA) using a graded protocol. Briefly, participants were allowed to warm-up by walking on the treadmill at 4.8 km/h (3.",a52304d3-cd47-4897-92c5-f7dbe5d15656
5,methods5,"0 mph) for 3 min. After the warm-up was completed, the treadmill incline was set to 1% and belt speed was set to the speed pre-indicated by the participants as a comfortable 5-km running pace. Thereafter, the treadmill grade increased by 2% every 2 min until the participants indicated volitional fatigue. Expired gases during the tests were continuously analyzed using a TrueMax 2400 metabolic measurement system (ParvoMedics, Sandy, UT, USA), averaged in 15-s intervals, and the highest 15-s average for VO2 was denoted as the VO2peak.  2.4. Blood-Serum Collection and Analysis Blood was collected in a 4-h fasted state at T1 and T3 from the antecubital vein and allowed to clot at room temperature. Thereafter, tubes were centrifuged at 3500 g (23 °C) for 10 min. Serum was aliquoted in 1.7 mL microtubes and stored at −80 °C. Once the study was completed, all tubes were transported to the East Alabama Medical Center (Opelika, AL, USA) whereby blood glucose and lipids were determined.",bccee9bf-77fa-4369-98b7-765d394b7231
6,methods6," Additionally, whole-blood (2-h post prandial) beta-hydroxbutyrate (blood beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB)) concentrations were determined weekly via finger sticks using a handheld analyzer and testing strips (CardioChek, Indianapolis, IN, USA).  2.5. Anaerobic Performance Assessments Approximately 48–96 h following T1 and T3, as well as two and one-half weeks into the intervention, participants performed one repetition maximum (1-RM) back squat and power clean assessments using a 20 kg barbell (York Barbell) and free weights at the local CrossFit gymnasium (Backbone CrossFit, Auburn, AL, USA). The demonstration of proper technique as well as the implementation of progressively-loaded RM testing were overseen by Wesley C. Kephart and Coree D. Pledge, who have vast experience with strength and performance testing [14,15,16]. A repetition was not counted if subjects exhibited poor and/or unsafe technique or needed assistance with a repetition during maximal testing.",81cc1db6-fe3d-4c55-b8b2-501bc49b4dad
7,methods7," Approximately 10 min following 1-RM assessments, maximal repetition pushup tests were performed to volitional fatigue. Finally, 400-m run assessments were performed on an outdoor recreational track (400 m/lap) using a handheld timer. Unlike the laboratory tests, where participants were instructed to arrive following a 4-h fast, no mandated fasting was implemented prior to these performance tests.  2.6. Dietary Guidelines and Nutritional Intake Monitoring Following the T1 anaerobic testing procedures, participants in the KD group were given general KD guidelines and handouts of sample meal plans published by Volek and Phinney [17]. Participants in the continue their normal diet (CTL) group were instructed to maintain their normal dietary habits throughout the study. Only KD subjects were asked to complete three-day food logs (two weekdays and one weekend day) to return within one week of T1 and T3 testing.",8ee6abde-7bc0-4a5e-a212-900da40b7065
8,methods8," On each occasion, participants were given detailed written and verbal instructions on completing the food logs. Dietary intake data were analyzed using open-sourced software (http://www.myfitnesspal.com), which has been employed by our laboratory to analyze macronutrient data [15].  2.7. Statistical Analyses and Data Presentation All data herein are presented in figures as means ± standard error values with individual subject plots and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). With the exception of weekly blood blood beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels, which were compared between groups using independent samples t-tests, all dependent variables were examined between groups using two-way (group × time) repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVAs). Huynh-Feldt (H-F) corrections were applied for data where the assumption of sphericity was violated.",f2e9096a-87cd-438f-a12d-cb1a24573da2
9,methods9," Given our limited n-sizes, partial eta-squared values (ηp2) for group × time interactions, and interactions were further interrogated if they were significant (p < 0.05) or effect sizes were large (ηp2 > 0.14). In these cases, within-group dependent samples t-tests as well as between-group independent samples t-tests were performed as post hoc tests, and p-values between 0.05 and 0.10 (i.e., ‘approaching significance’) were considered meaningful due to limited n-sizes.  3. Results 3.1. Baseline Characteristics between Treatments Baseline characteristics between groups are presented in Table 1. Independent t-tests indicated that there were no between-group differences for age, height, body mass, dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) body fat percentage, or strength:mass ratio. Notably, one KD participant presented with a strength: body mass ratio of 0.93, but the investigators decided to include the subject in the analyses due to limited n-sizes.  3.2.",fd849d24-3635-48cb-bca7-90e9243660c1
10,methods10," Self-Reported Macronutrient Intakes and Workouts Completed over the Intervention As noted previously, only the KD participants completed food logs. Of the seven KD participants, only four returned the T3 food logs. Notably, self-reported carbohydrate consumption decreased (T1 = 164 ± 32 g/d, T3 = 15 ± 3 g/d, p = 0.014) and total calorie consumption decreased (T1 = 2499 ± 350 kcal/d, T3 = 1948 ± 293 kcal/d, p = 0.032). While self-reported dietary fat values were greater (T1 = 154 ± 40 g/d, T3 = 170 ± 25 g/d, p = 0.576) and protein values were lower (T1 = 114 ± 10 g/d, T3 = 89 ± 20 kcal/d, p = 0.112), there were no significant differences between pre- and post-values. Additionally, while three participants failed to return post-study food logs, weeks 1–12 average blood ketone levels for these participants were 0.87, 0.95, and 1.43 μM, suggesting that they complied with the KD guidelines throughout the study.",6114dfe6-4b30-49bd-9d3f-3624b932fd72
11,methods11,"  Regarding CrossFit workouts completed over the intervention, the KD group completed an average of 27 ± 3 workouts, whereas the continue their normal diet (CTL) group completed an average of 20 ± 5 workouts (p = 0.245 between conditions).   3.3. Weekly Blood Ketone Levels and Changes in Body Composition Metrics Blood blood beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels were 2.8–9.5-fold higher in KD versus continue their normal diet (CTL) throughout the intervention confirming a state of nutritional ketosis in the KD group. In addition, independent samples t-tests indicated that humoral blood beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the KD group at weeks 1–6, 9 and 12 (Figure 2a). A main time effect (T1 > T3; p = 0.020) and large effect for the group × time interaction was observed for change in body mass between groups (p = 0.053, ηp2 = 0.325; Figure 2b); notably a significant decrease from T1 within the KD group was observed (p = 0.022).",41f4b03a-d7cc-45aa-a0cd-021ecb6490ea
12,methods12," Additionally, a main time effect approached significance (T1 > T3; p = 0.051), and a large effect for the group × time interaction was observed for change in dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) fat mass between groups (p = 0.126, ηp2 = 0.218; Figure 2c); notably, the decrease from T1 within the KD group approached significance (p = 0.053). There was no main time effect (p = 0.521) or group × time interaction observed for dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) lean body mass (p = 0.534, ηp2 = 0.040; Figure 2d). There was no main time effect (p = 0.876) or group × time interaction observed dual-arm dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) lean mass (p = 0.742, ηp2 = 0.011; Figure 2e). There was no main time effect for dual-leg dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) lean mass (p = 0.344), although a large effect for the group × time interaction was observed (p = 0.111, ηp2 = 0.234; Figure 2f) whereby lower T3 values in the KD group approached significance (p = 0.068).",3038a3bb-7f68-4f71-88fa-f2cb6772491d
13,methods13," Likewise, there was no main time effect for ultrasound derived vastus lateralis thickness (p = 0.159), although a large effect for the group × time interaction was observed (p = 0.180, ηp2 = 0.172; Figure 2e) whereby lower T3 values in the KD group approached significance (p = 0.065).  3.4. Changes in Resting Metabolic Metrics There was no time (p = 0.781) or group × time interaction observed for resting energy expenditure (p = 0.613, ηp2 = 0.024; Figure 3a). There was a significant time effect (T1 > T3, p = 0.002) observed for resting RQ, although there was no group × time interaction (p = 0.916, ηp2 = 0.001; Figure 3b).  3.5. Changes in Performance Metrics There was no main time effect [Huynh-Feldt (H-F) p = 0.626] or group × time interaction observed for 1-RM squat (H-F p = 0.422, ηp2 = 0.073; Figure 4a). There was no main time effect (p = 0.995) or group × time interaction observed for 1-RM power clean (p = 0.347, ηp2 = 0.100; Figure 4b).",01c5e6c9-8c77-49ba-bfd1-6bd237a0151d
14,methods14,"  There was a main time effect regarding maximum pushup repetitions (T3 > T1 and T2, p = 0.032 and p = 0.016, respectively), but no group × time interaction was observed (H-F p = 0.716, ηp2 = 0.020; Figure 4c). There was no main time effect (p = 0.326) or group × time interaction observed for 400-m run time (p = 0.479, ηp2 = 0.071; Figure 4d). There was no main time effect observed for observed for VO2peak (p = 0.105), although a large effect for the group × time interaction was observed (p = 0.188, ηp2 = 0.166; Figure 4e). However, numerically greater T3 values in the KD (p = 0.782) and continue their normal diet (CTL) (p = 0.109) groups did not approach statistical significance.  3.6. Changes in Blood-Serum Parameters Changes in blood parameters between groups are presented in Table 2. There was no main time effect (p = 0.190) or group × time interaction observed for serum glucose (p = 0.881, ηp2 = 0.002). There was no main time effect (p = 0.",30069d4d-fa2e-4da2-a0d0-8109266afe1c

There was no main time effect (p = 0.977) or group × time interaction observed for triglycerides (p = 0.585, ηp2 = 0.031). There was no main time effect (p = 0.147), although there was a significant and large effect for the group × time interaction observed for serum LDL cholesterol levels (p = 0.029, ηp2 = 0.393), and post hoc tests indicated within-group increases for the KD group (p = 0.048) and significant decreases in the continue their normal diet (CTL) group (p = 0.006).  4. Discussion This is one of the first reports to examine the longer-term physiological and performance effects of a ketogenic diet in recreationally resistance-trained individuals.",c15a9f7b-075e-42c9-9cf6-bdaf7f9b6dfe
16,methods16," As mentioned previously, we have demonstrated in rats that six weeks of KD feeding does not adversely affect markers of muscle hypertrophy, and that KD- and WD-fed rats experienced similar increases in hind limb muscle masses and molecular markers suggestive of anabolism when voluntarily trained on resistance-loaded running wheels over a six-week period [5]. Likewise, Paoli et al. [10], Wilson et al. [7] and Gregory et al. [11] reported that humans engaging in a KD do not experience anaerobic performance deficits over a 4–10-week period. Herein, we add to these data to suggest that individuals who train recreationally at a CrossFit gym while adopting a KD for 12 weeks experience a reduction in whole-body adiposity with little influence on metabolic or exercise performance measures. It is notable, however, that KD participants did experience decrements in vastus lateralis thickness and dual-leg dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) lean mass following the intervention.",821dc070-c902-452d-b698-fafda804e6cb
17,methods17," These findings counter the Paoli et al. [10], Wilson et al. [7], and Gregory et al. [11] data, although several studies have reported that engaging in a 12-week KD decreases dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) lean body mass in individuals who participated in a diet-only intervention [18,19,20]. Notably, our body composition findings could be indicative of resultant fluid shifts that occur via KD. While we did confirm a state of adequate hydration via urinalysis, others have reported that four months of KD elicited a marked reduction in dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) lean body mass primarily due to changes in total body water (assessed via bioelectrical impedance) [21]. Given these discordant data, more human studies are needed for clarity regarding shorter-term and longer-term KD effects on whole-body hydration, protein metabolism, muscle protein synthesis levels, and muscle fiber histological attributes (i.e., muscle fiber cross sectional area) in exercise-trained individuals.",63bd5460-edcc-4f89-8039-99b9da8e5a65
18,methods18,"  While no performance decrements were evident in KD participants following the intervention, it is notable that these participants did not experience improvements in certain performance measures relative to continue their normal diet (CTL) participants (e.g., 1-RM squat and VO2peak). Alternatively stated, the continue their normal diet (CTL) group may have experienced significant improvements in select performance measures had n-sizes been larger or the study had been longer in duration. Select commentaries have asserted that individuals who aim to optimize anaerobic endeavors benefit from higher amounts of dietary carbohydrates; case in point, a recent commentary suggests that consuming 2.5 g/kg 3 h prior to exercise and 9 g/kg during post-exercise recovery will benefit stop-and-go athletes [22]. While individuals in the current study were recreationally trained, we observed no performance decrements 2.5 weeks or 12 weeks after engaging in a KD.",3b421751-2ea2-4d81-a044-2acbf6c8d068
19,methods19," Indeed, our data agree with others who reported that KD does not adversely affect anaerobic performance [7,10]. Moreover, others have reported that aerobic-based athletes experience increases in fat oxidation during running [23], improvements in O2 uptake at lactate threshold after longer-term KD [24], and even improvements in sprint performance [25]. Hence, we contend that the human body is capable of adapting to several different diets during periods of exercise training, and performance may not be compromised so long as caloric needs are met. Notwithstanding, given that KD-induced anaerobic and aerobic performance improvements were not evident herein or in other published reports, we contend that practitioners should explore implementing this diet when body composition improvements are sought rather than performance benefits.  Another interesting finding was that those in the KD group experienced increases in serum LDL cholesterol levels.",5bf9bf05-4427-49ed-902e-e9630b033a90
20,methods20," Human reports are mixed with regard to how partaking in a KD affects serum LDL cholesterol levels, with some data suggesting decreases [18], no effects [20], or increases [19]. Additionally, our findings are limited in that we did not quantify LDL particle size. In this regard, Volek et al. reported that a 12-week KD intervention positively affected LDL particle size, saturated fat content in triglycerides, and Apo B/Apo A-1 ratios [18]. However, it is notable that the subjects in all of these aforementioned studies examined overweight and/or hyperlipidemic individuals. Thus, it remains plausible that otherwise healthy individuals may present increases in LDL cholesterol levels when adopting a KD. To this end, more research is needed to firmly assess how partaking in KD affects blood lipid levels in healthy versus unhealthy individuals.  5. Limitations and Conclusions One obvious limitation to the current study is the limited number of participants.",3d3004c7-f952-4301-a264-fdee487af76a
21,methods21," Hence, we feel that it is important to interpret our current data within this context. Additionally, there is the real chance that individuals in the KD group may have experienced a placebo effect in relation to performance outcomes. Alternatively stated, given that many of the KD participants experienced improvements in body composition and (anecdotally) many of these participants perceived themselves having more energy throughout the day, these phenomena could have motivated them to perform the exercise tests with more vigor relative to the continue their normal diet (CTL) group.  To summarize, our data suggest that a 12-week KD in recreationally-trained CrossFit trainees facilitates improvements in whole-body adiposity without compromising weightlifting, running, or aerobic performance metrics.",ae9c8cae-079c-454b-84e0-85d402f27255
22,methods22," However, our finding that KD may reduce leg muscle mass suggests that, over prolonged periods, the diet could adversely affect muscle anabolism and warrants further human investigations using sensitive histological techniques. Additionally, given our observation that KD increased serum LDL cholesterol levels, more research is needed regarding how longer-term KD engagement affects blood lipid levels in normolipidemic athletes. Notwithstanding, the novelty of this study examining how a longer term KD affects anaerobic performance metrics continues to contribute to field of sports nutrition and challenges the paradigm regarding very high carbohydrate needs in anaerobic trainees or athletes.
