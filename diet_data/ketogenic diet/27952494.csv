0,background0,"Obesity, both independently, and in association with other obesity-related diseases, leads to adverse physiological effects of many aspects of health including sleep [1, 2], cognitive function [3, 4], and cardiovascular health [5]. A reduction in body fat is a significant treatment target used to improve obesity-induced adverse effects on each of these physiological health variables [6–8]. However, studies investigating the effect of diet on the physiological aspects of health independent of the loss of weight (whether total mass or fat mass) are lacking. Diets low in carbohydrate and high in fat, or ketogenic diets (KD), are conventionally used to treat epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders [9, 10], but have been relatively popular for weight loss since the 1800s [11]. Studies on KDs vary in their daily limit of carbohydrate intake; carbohydrate consumption may be restricted to as low as 4% [12, 13] up to 40% [14, 15] of daily caloric intake.",785f6668-75ff-4bd9-9e00-b48006c174e4
1,background1," The fundamental principle of the KD, however, is severe restriction of dietary carbohydrate consumption, with a concurrent increase in dietary fat to compensate for the energy deficit, resulting in the promotion of lipid oxidation to produce ketones as an energy source (as opposed to glucose), and thus, a metabolic state of nutritional ketosis [16].  Obesity affects various aspects of physiological health, including sleep and cognition. Compared to controls, obese individuals have more night-time wakefulness and less total sleep time [17]. Furthermore obesity with [18] and without [17] sleep apnea is associated with fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and poor sleep quality. A reduction in body fat improves obesity-related adverse effects on sleep architecture and daytime sleepiness [7].",b3f6d099-61ce-42b6-84d3-7af47b329488
2,background2," In populations with sleep abnormalities, a KD has been shown to reduce sleepiness [19, 20] and normalize sleep architecture [19, 21] but this change was in association with a loss of body mass, particularly body fat [19]. In healthy, non-obese men who were good sleepers, a KD diet increases slow-wave sleep and decreases rapid-eye-movement sleep [22] compared to a high-carbohydrate, low-fat (high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF)) diet [1]. Studies investigating the effect of the KD on sleep, however, are limited by their study populations and small sample sizes.  Obesity is also a risk factor for dementia and adverse changes to brain structure and function [3].",7ffd1a55-e52d-44e2-81e6-614591a65c97
3,background3," The relationship between obesity and cognitive decline is likely to be bidirectional, with suggestions that a gain in body fat may, at least in part, be the result of a neurological predisposition characterized by reduced executive brain function, but that obesity further compounds the adverse effects on the brain, possibly via mechanisms involving inflammatory pathways, elevated lipids and/or insulin resistance [8]. There is some evidence to suggest that loss of body mass has the potential to reverse some of the negative obesity-related effects on cognition, particularly with regards to working memory following significant weight loss [12]. Independent of obesity, prospective human studies have identified high-fat diets, particularly diets rich in saturated fats, as risk factors for developing Alzheimer’s disease and dementia [23–26].",4bd9a61a-3b4a-4388-8d14-f9aba9627eba
4,background4," Most human studies highlight that specific types of fats are more important than total fat intake; in particular, omega-6 and saturated fatty acids are associated with reduced cognitive performance [24, 27–29]. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of the KD on cognition in younger, healthy individuals, are lacking in the academic literature. Therefore, it is yet to be determined whether increased adiposity, or the consumption of high-fat diets, is responsible for cognitive decline.  Dietary effects on cardiovascular function have been investigated more than any other physiological function. However, the majority of studies have been conducted in obese and/or overweight individuals, who are likely to be in an obesity-induced, low-grade pro-inflammatory state.",6037102c-3551-4c9f-ad05-57430f088a34
5,background5," Apprehensions exist that the KD, with its concomitant high intake of total and saturated fat, adversely affects blood lipid levels and hence, increases the risk for cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) [30–36]. Traditionally, a low-fat diet is prescribed for body fat reduction for obese patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and it is suggested that the fat loss following any diet restriction and/or exercise accounts for the favorable improvements seen in cardiovascular health [37, 38]. However, a meta-analysis on 23 controlled trials involving 1141 obese patients, reported that the KD diet in fact has favorable effects on cardiovascular health [39].",d0a1ed35-ff78-4cde-9e75-1acb77eb9797
6,background6," In particular, the KD is associated with significant reductions in plasma triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, plasma insulin, C-reactive protein, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, total body mass, abdominal circumference, as well as significant increases in high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) cholesterol, with no significant changes in low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)) cholesterol [39].  The inconsistencies in the results of studies comparing physiological variables between the KD with the current recommended high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF) diet, are further confounded by the fact that total body mass loss is associated with both these diets, particularly with calorie restriction.",56955862-c36b-430b-9a0c-7a4360d15a7b
7,background7," Given that physiological factors, such as sleep and cardiovascular health, are altered by a reduction in body fat, especially in overweight and obese populations, it is difficult to differentiate between the effects of the loss of fat mass or dietary composition. It is, therefore, important to explore the physiological outcomes of these diets in the absence of any change in body mass.  Further, it is important to note that even with an increase in calorie intake on a KD, a greater loss of body mass has been reported in overweight adolescents compared with those on the high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF) diet, and it has been suggested that a non-calorie restricted KD may be more effective than a very-low-calorie diet due a greater maintenance of metabolic rate, which is a consequence of a higher caloric intake [40].",53167848-1352-4f05-981e-316abffe64b9
8,background8," Despite the most common application for the KD being a reduction in total body mass, there is astonishingly little research investigating the effects of a KD, compared with the conventional high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF) diet, on basal metabolic rate (basal metabolic rate (BMR)) or thyroid function [41, 42]. Changes in the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) that contribute to maintenance of metabolic rate due to a low-carbohydrate diet have produced mixed results [41–43]. Importantly, however, caloric intake in these studies was not controlled. Instead, greater loss of body mass on the KD compared with high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF) diets, in obese and/or overweight individuals, has been attributed to spontaneous reduction in caloric intake [41, 44, 45], reduced hunger and/or increased satiety due to increased fat consumption [46–49], or an inhibitory effect of β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) (the major circulating ketone body) on appetite [50].",807e2683-dc97-4946-9ddc-8de827ef4cb9
9,background9," Given the persistent metabolic adaptation that follows loss of total body mass and/or calorie restriction, namely adaptive thermogenesis, which promotes an overall decline in energy expenditure and a reduced basal metabolic rate (BMR) [51, 52], it is intriguing to determine whether diet composition, independent of a loss of body mass, caloric intake, and levels of physical activity, has any significant metabolic effects.  A controlled, cross-over dietary intervention in healthy individuals, incorporating vital aspects of physiological health into one study and negating the effect of body mass loss and calorie intake, has not yet been done.",7fc0ac08-3c7c-4722-becd-a930b25f049a
10,background10," Given that the majority of studies investigating the KD have: (1) been done in overweight/obese populations, with or without diabetes mellitus and/or insulin resistance, (2) did not control for total caloric intake and levels of physical activity, and (3) did not incorporate a cross-over of subjects doing both diets, this study will account for the many study limitations that exist in the current academic literature by controlling for body mass, existing disease, and calorie intake. Therefore, we wish to determine, in a randomized-controlled cross-over study design, whether a KD, compared with a high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF) diet, affects sleep, cognition, thyroid function, and cardiovascular effects in a generally healthy, non-obese/overweight population while maintaining body mass on the two diets.",7d5aaf47-b284-443a-aa2e-f26ea932942b
11,background11," In addition, we aim to determine whether basal metabolic rate (BMR) is different between the ketogenic and high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF) diets in normal healthy adults and whether this difference is associated with any difference in sleep, cognitive and cardiovascular physiology.

The study will follow the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (Standard Protocol Items Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT)) guidelines for the design and conduct of a trial (Fig. 1; Additional file 1) [53]. As outlined in Fig. 2, participants will be asked to visit the Movement Physiology Research Laboratory on five occasions; the first visit will be for screening the volunteers to ensure that they fit the study criteria. Thereafter, eligible participants will return to the laboratory before the start of, and after, each dietary intervention. Following 1 week of normal habitual dietary monitoring, each participant will follow two isocaloric diets (a KD and a high-carbohydrate, low-fat (high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF)) diet) in a randomized order and separated by a 1-week washout period.",5c15c656-a96b-4b32-ac06-d502fc4c0ff3
13,methods1," Randomization of the order of the diets will be done using the Microsoft Excel 2010 (Version 14.0) CHOOSE and RANDBETWEEN functions. These functions (=CHOOSE(RANDBETWEEN(1,2), “A”,“B”) are able to assign each new participant into one of the two diets. Each dietary intervention will last for a minimum period of 3 weeks. In the KD it is critical for the participant to remain in a ketogenic state for three consecutive weeks. Should the participant leave the ketogenic state (as assessed by blood ketone levels), the dietary intervention period will be prolonged until the consecutive, 3-week ketogenic state is achieved. If a participant does not reach a ketogenic state in 2 weeks, we will exclude them, as it is indicative of non-compliance.",4d0cb631-957a-4cda-8613-5c6f2af3deb3
14,methods2," However, we will be more lenient with someone who has entered a ketogenic state but may struggle to maintain the state, in which case we will guide them by closely monitoring their diet to ensure that their carbohydrate intake is suitably low and that their fat intake is suitably high. We will also look at the content of each participant’s diet to ensure that the foods do not contain imperceptible carbohydrates or that their protein content is not too high, which may result in gluconeogenesis. We will continuously encourage pure fat intake, e.g., cooking with olive oil, butter or coconut oil. Should a participant leave the ketogenic state more than five times they will be excluded from the study.Fig. 1 Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (Standard Protocol Items Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT)) schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments for the duration of the study.",8ad65282-e931-418f-b293-1c41827eb791

Volunteers will be excluded if they are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 26 kg/m2), have any adverse cardiac or metabolic conditions such as type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia or hypertension confirmed by a clinician. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) [55] and the General Health Questionnaire (General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)) [56] will be used to assess quality of sleep and psychological health, respectively.

If they are not taking any supplement they will be asked not to start taking one during the study. Using the dietary data obtained from 1 week of habitual dietary monitoring at the start of the study, daily calorie intake will be calculated for each participant and the total amount of calories consumed daily during both dietary interventions will be based on this value.  Dietary intervention Participants will, in a random order, follow a KD (15% carbohydrate, 60% fat, and 25% protein) and a high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF) diet (55% carbohydrate, 20% fat, and 25% protein).

Therefore, the PI will formulate individualized meal plans with the correct respective macronutrient content for each dietary intervention according to each participant’s habitual calorie intake. The PI will also educate each participant on the fundamentals of each dietary intervention and provide foodlists, and other resources containing information on dietary macronutrient compositions and calories, to assist each participant to make food choices of their preference, but in line with the dietary intervention.

The applications have the functionality to export detailed diet data for later analysis. In addition, the PI will be able to remotely monitor (smart devices will be connected), and critically analyze and assess, macronutrient composition and calorie intake, in order to provide each participant with daily feedback during the diets.

Levels of BOHB will be measured before and after each dietary intervention, as well as at the end of each week while participants are on the KD. During the intervention, each participant will be provided with a β-ketone handheld analyzer and shown explicitly how to use the device.

Maintenance of a ketogenic state for three consecutive weeks will be a critical requirement of the study. When participants leave the ketogenic state (considered as BOHB levels below 0.4 nM), the dietary intervention period will be prolonged until the consecutive 3-week ketogenic state is achieved.

The present study design aims to control for all the above limitations and to determine the effects of diet on various physiological parameters in the absence of a variation in calorie input and output, and thus, the absence of body mass change. Another limitation of studies is that the level of carbohydrate restriction in the KD varies from study to study.",4e1dbf85-6e77-4dbe-8934-9394e2032624
31,discussion2," We chose a level of 15% of calorie derivation from carbohydrates for our KD based on more recent RCTs that have restricted their diets to 20% carbohydrates [59, 60].  Weight loss is an outcome measure of most studies; however, mechanisms to explain potential changes in weight are poorly explored and the observed weight loss is often used to explain other effects on physiological health [6–8]. Despite a large number of studies investigating the effects of diet on weight loss, the effect of diet on thyroid function and basal metabolic rate (BMR) is poorly understood. Following short-term and sustained weight loss, adaptive thermogenesis occurs, where total energy expenditure, non-resting energy expenditure and resting energy expenditure, are all significantly reduced compared with pre-weight-loss measures [52]. Thus, the decline in overall energy expenditure, favors the regain of the lost weight, and this metabolic compensation persists well beyond the period of active weight loss [38].",c1c5a187-41cd-4a27-8061-399a089e2b64

Exercise-associated thermogenesis (Exercise associated thermogenesis (EAT)), non-exercise-associate thermogenesis (non exercise associate thermogenesis (NExercise associated thermogenesis (EAT))), and TEF (the thermic effect of food) constitute the three components of the more changeable components of metabolism, and are known collectively as NREE (non-resting energy expenditure).

In particular, each dietary intervention (macronutrient composition) will be designed according to each participant’s habitual daily calorie consumption. The purpose is to mitigate a change in body mass and, therefore, the associated changes in metabolism, in order to determine whether dietary macronutrient composition alone (i.e.",dacf5d46-aba6-4e04-8134-5518d2e164f5
34,discussion5,", changes in the relative contribution of each macronutrient consumed daily, without changing total calorie intake) can affect metabolic rate, and related thyroid function.  Furthermore, our study aims to investigate inflammatory markers that are risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A limited number of studies investigating the effects of diet on CRP and adipocytokines, such as TNF-α, have been performed and have produced conflicting results [15, 62–64]. It is also important to note that their results are further confounded by the populations studied, given that both CRP and adipocytokines are affected by obesity and weight loss [65, 66]. We therefore believe that these measurements will add valuable insight to cardiovascular function and inflammatory markers in a healthy population.",365c9e8d-b8bb-41c6-b06b-fef9cac812f6
