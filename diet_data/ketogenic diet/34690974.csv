1,methods1,"  Pathophysiology of Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)  Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is caused by Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors via various factors ultimately leading to an increased glucagon/insulin ratio. Normally, glucosuria occurs when blood glucose concentration crosses the threshold of 225 mg/dl. Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors act on proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney, block glucose reabsorption even at physiologic serum glucose concentrations, and cause glucosuria and osmotic diuresis even in normoglycemia [6]. This results in a carbohydrate deficit, which causes increased glucagon levels. It also directly stimulates pancreatic cells to increase glucagon release as well as increases ketone reabsorption. Increased glucagon/insulin ratio results in lipolysis and increased free fatty acid levels, which undergo beta-oxidation and hepatic ketogenesis and get converted into ketone bodies like acetone and 3-hydroxybutyrate.",7cadc602-7940-4c0f-9462-e3f284734e5f
2,methods2," Stress, illness, surgery, fasting, and ketogenic diets result in increased levels of counterregulatory hormones like cortisol and catecholamines, which ultimately causes an increased glucagon/insulin ratio [5,7,8]. Pregnancy is a physiologic state of hypoinsulinemia and the human lactogen hormone produced during pregnancy causes insulin resistance, vomiting, and starvation resulting in ketogenesis, in addition to that respiratory alkalosis, which is also common in pregnancy due to stimulation of the respiratory center by progesterone, which results in bicarbonate excretion and acidosis develops [5]. It is important to note that the fetus and placenta use large amounts of maternal glucose as a major source of energy, and this leads to decreased maternal fasting glucose [9]. Hence, pregnancy is an important precipitating factor for euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).",3a8e3fbb-80db-48aa-a304-ccb5354592a6
3,methods3," Alcohol consumption can result in pancreatic destruction, which in turn leads to decreased gluconeogenesis and decreased glycogen stores. In addition to that, vomiting and carbohydrate starvation result in accelerated lipolysis, ketoacidosis, and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) [5].  Pharmacokinetics of Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 Inhibitors  Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors share similar pharmacokinetic characteristics with rapid oral absorption, extensive hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation, and renal as well as fecal elimination. Almost all of them have long half-lives hence once daily administration is adequate [10]. Hence, these drugs are contraindicated in case of renal failure and caution must be taken in patients having hepatic dysfunction. The area under the curve and Cmax increase proportionately in a dose-dependent manner.",d22ded5e-81c6-4d17-b899-bf7e80e6ed49
4,methods4," Drugs are distributed largely to the kidney and are found in smaller amounts in the liver, stomach, and small and large intestines. The lipophilicity of the drugs is different, it increases from empagliflozin< dapagliflozin< canagliflozin. Individual drug pharmacokinetics are shown in Table 1 [11-14].

5,methods5,"5%	(Only approved in Japan)	  Current Guidelines for the Management of Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)  Initially, the diagnosis of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) should be made based on positive serum and urine ketone levels along with pH < 7.3 and raised anion gap with serum glucose < 250 mg/dl. Management includes stopping Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors immediately, intravenous fluid resuscitation, continuous intravenous insulin infusion, 5% dextrose infusion, and potassium monitoring [5]. Initially, we use isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) for fluid resuscitation for one to two hours at a rate of 1-1.5 L/hr according to the American Diabetes Association. Continuous IV insulin infusion should be started along with fluids at the rate of 0.05-0.1 U/kg/hr and to avoid hypoglycemia and hasten the clearance of ketone bodies, we should start the patient on 5% dextrose solution as well.",12f1e21c-2455-4437-bb03-882c412a7876
6,methods6," After euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) resolves, we can transfer the patient from IV insulin to SC insulin by keeping an overlap of two hours between them [15]. While the patient is on insulin infusion, it is important to monitor potassium levels as there is a total body potassium deficit and insulin tends to drive potassium into the cell. So, if potassium levels go below 3.3 mg/dl, we should stop insulin and initiate potassium replacement. Close monitoring of the patient’s blood glucose, electrolyte, and anion gap levels should be done every two to four hours and fluid resuscitation should be continued until the anion gap closes and acidosis resolves. The literature recommends not using bicarbonates in the treatment [5].  Review ",ff0fe1f9-eb45-4f31-9bae-90a8c2c5e0e3
7,discussion0," Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors like canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and empagliflozin (Jardiance) have been approved by the FDA for use in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The average half-lives of these drugs range from 11-13 hours. According to the pharmacokinetics of the drug, it takes five half-lives for 97% of the drug to be eliminated from the body. Hence, the current recommendation by FDA, which was revised in 2022, is to stop these drugs three days before surgery [7]. Similarly, an International Consensus Review on Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors suggested stopping the drug three days before surgery [16]. Lau et al. also supported this idea by mentioning in their article that in major elective surgical procedures, Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors should be discontinued three days preoperatively, with the last dose taken no less than 55-65 hours before the surgery [17].  However, it was suggested by Pace et al.",e8861248-a441-4822-b49a-2f23c212dc2a
8,discussion1," to stop the drug for five days before any surgery but if the patient has renal damage, it will take more than five days for complete clearance of the drug, i.e., almost 11 half-lives for 99.93% of the drug to be eliminated from the body [18]. But other factors play an important role in causing euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in addition to the drug itself. Alhemeiri et al. described a case where euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurred even after the patient self-stopped the drug within 48 hours of his presentation because the patient had started following a ketogenic diet 72 hours before his presentation [19].",51f8d75d-aa99-48f7-8825-14969cfa57dd
9,discussion2," This shows that a ketogenic diet, a high fat, adequate protein, and low carbohydrate (< 50 grams) diet, is an additional factor in causing euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), as ketogenic diets result in high glucagon and low insulin levels along with increased levels of counterregulatory hormones like epinephrine and cortisol, which results in increased free fatty acid levels, which, in turn, increases ketone body production. Thus healthcare workers should counsel the patients regarding their diet before starting them on Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors. Pujara et al. have shown in their case report that glucosuria and ketonemia persisted nine to 10 days after stopping dapagliflozin, hence they recommend stopping the drug one week before any elective procedure [20], which indicates that the effect of the drug stays longer than expected based on its half-lives so we need more insight into the pharmacodynamics of the drug. Iqbal et al.",5a1ff3be-374a-4097-9de8-af29be0c3074
10,discussion3," described a case of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) being developed even after stopping dapagliflozin before two weeks of presentation even with normal renal function tests [21]. This shows that we need to take into account additional factors like genetic variation, drug-drug interaction, and other patient characteristics that can result in euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) when deciding the time interval between drug stoppage and any elective procedure. We believe it will be helpful if we choose patients based on inclusion criteria for starting them on Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors, as mentioned in Table 2, to reduce the risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).",e114e122-d9b8-4684-96ee-bd0e9808d83b

12,discussion5," Parkin et al. mentioned that for patients who are switching their type of insulin therapy (e.g., injections to insulin pump therapy) or changing from manual mode to auto mode on an automated insulin delivery system, it is prudent that they hold their Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitor until their insulin doses are adjusted, blood glucose is controlled, and ketone levels are normal [16]. The European Medicines Agency suggests stopping the treatment with Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors immediately if diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is suspected and not starting the drug until a clear precipitating factor has been identified and resolved. It also advises doctors to not use Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors for type 1DM [22]. Lau et al.",5dae4e12-892c-4b83-b194-e90aeb89e838
13,discussion6," recommended postoperative Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors administration be withheld until adequate hydration and normal diet resumes and to consider bridging therapy with insulin/dextrose to prevent the development of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) [17]. It is only logical to stop the drug permanently if the patient experiences recurrent euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), but acknowledging comorbid cardiac conditions that patients may have and that the benefits of Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors outweigh their risk, continuing such patients on Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors is still an area that will need thorough research. Different drug interactions can also result in euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as explained in Figure 2.",6bac2c6d-2df1-4e33-b96c-16101b57199c

Hence, patient counseling regarding this issue should be done by their primary care providers.",006d3471-5d5f-4ade-82f9-d62795cc0460
15,discussion8,"  It is recommended that a multidisciplinary approach will be beneficial when dealing with Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitor-induced euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and deciding its withholding period pre and post a euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) episode. We encourage this decision to be made collectively by a team of endocrinologists, cardiologists, nephrologists, primary care physicians, and critical care physicians. Moreover, it is also important to counsel patients regarding appropriate dietary habits while taking the drug, i.e., not following low carbohydrate diets without consulting their primary care physicians. They should also be made aware of “sick day rules” where the patient is advised to not take the medication during acute illness [26]  Thorough research needs to be done in this area, which will help us develop a guideline for patients taking Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors.",1d4b15ea-af1d-4d16-8c2b-081798634b23
16,discussion9,"  Conclusions  The purpose of this literature review is to provide data regarding existing guidelines for Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitor-induced euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) when it comes to stopping and restarting the drug. These guidelines vary among different institutions and different specialties based on the existing literature that we found; hence, we need more concrete research in this area to solidify the guidelines and solve the dilemma of whether to continue the drug after the euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) episode. This literature review tries to inform us that we need to take into account patient inclusion criteria, concomitant therapies, thorough patient counseling regarding precipitating factors, and easy access to health care, as delayed treatment in case of severe acidosis can be fatal when deciding the guidelines for restarting the drug after a euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) episode.",64031334-90cf-43b2-9b2f-6345a83562d6
