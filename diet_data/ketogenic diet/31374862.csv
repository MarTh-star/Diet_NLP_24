0,introduction0,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and impaired cognitive functions. Recent evidence suggests age-related metabolic dysfunction plays a role in promoting cognitive impairment and overall AD pathology [1–5]. Key features of AD pathology include the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques followed by the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) [6]. In response to Aβ aggregation, microglia promote Aβ and tau clearance and create physical barriers to protect neurons from neurotoxic plaque, but also drive neuroinflammation that damages neurons [7–12]. Chronic activation of the nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has emerged as an important mechanism in continual neuroinflammation that significantly increases AD pathology [13]. Therefore, inhibiting NLRP3 activation could be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.",b3ff2436-d0b6-4ddd-b0cb-028aa90a769a
1,introduction1,"  The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate dietary regimen that stimulates the breakdown of fatty acids and ketogenic amino acids, a process that results in the production of ketone bodies that can be further metabolized for energy production. The three ketone bodies are acetone, acetoacetate, and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Previous work has shown that BHB is present at significantly lower levels in the blood of AD patients [14]. Furthermore, higher circulating BHB levels in the blood of AD patients are correlated with increased scores on cognitive tests [14–18], and BHB has been shown to modify disease in mouse models of AD by unknown mechanisms [19–21]. Recently, BHB was shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in human monocytes [22]. Given these findings, and that BHB can effectively cross the blood–brain barrier, further investigation is warranted to determine a potential mechanism by which BHB attenuates AD pathology.",847eda47-0ab7-4558-b555-9b7600039705
2,introduction2,"  In this study, we demonstrate that exogenous BHB administration to mice carrying human presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and amyloid precursor protein (amyloid precursor protein (APP)) with 5 familial AD mutations under the CD90 promoter, which deposit Aβ plaques [23] (5XFAD mice), decreases overall AD pathology through inhibition of the inflammasome. We found that BHB levels in brain tissue and red blood cell samples from AD patients were significantly lower than those from non-AD controls. We then confirmed that BHB inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome in bone marrow-derived macrophages (bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM)) by decreased levels of IL-1β and caspase-1. Using the 5XFAD mouse model of AD, BHB treatment resulted in dramatically fewer cortical plaques accompanied by decreased cortical volume occupied by plaques. We also observed less pronounced microgliosis in the BHB-treated 5XFAD mice, which had significantly less processed caspase-1 in their cortices.",16cb0048-0e37-4f47-b348-3ae80a7ffc97
3,introduction3," Consistent with a decrease in NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we observed significantly fewer apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (Asc) specks in the BHB-treated 5XFAD mice. Overall, our findings demonstrate that augmenting BHB levels may be a promising preventative and therapeutic strategy for AD.  Results and discussion AD patients have lower levels of BHB in their blood and brain parenchyma Recent studies suggest AD pathology is driven by age-related metabolic dysfunction in the brain [1, 2]. Also, during the immune response to AD onset, the metabolic state of microglia affects disease progression [3–5]. Glucose appears to be the main energy source for both microglial and brain energy metabolism, but other substrates, like ketone bodies, can be used as an alternative energy source. Surprisingly, one of the three ketone bodies, BHB, has been shown to be present at significantly lower levels in the blood of AD patients [14].",c2bc7a8f-0e39-42df-b1c9-920792048c0f
4,introduction4," In our study, we found BHB at significantly lower levels in the red blood cells of AD patients when compared with non-AD controls (P = 0.0002; two-tailed Student’s t test) (Fig. 1a, c). We also found that BHB levels were significantly reduced in the brain tissue of AD patients when compared with non-AD controls (P = 0.0036; two-tailed Student’s t test] (Fig. 1b, d) with a strong correlation between BHB levels in the brain and red blood cells (Fig. 1e). Previous work has demonstrated that higher circulating levels of BHB in AD patients are correlated with increased scores on cognitive tests [14–18]. The mechanism by which ketones, including BHB, improve cognition in AD patients is unclear. One of the most important known risk factors for developing AD is diabetes [24]. Several studies have demonstrated impaired insulin signaling and insulin resistance in the brain to AD pathogenesis [25–28].",04ef446b-ed97-4769-bc7e-7deb9f09c1aa
5,introduction5," A growing body of evidence suggests ketones can significantly improve glucose homeostasis which in turn reduces insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction [29, 30]. Clinical symptoms of AD rarely appear before decreases in the cerebral metabolism of glucose, indicating a link to local brain insulin resistance [26]. Ketone body metabolism can overcome insulin resistance, suggesting a therapeutic potential for ketone bodies in AD [31, 32]. Our data indicate that BHB levels are lower in AD patients, suggesting an important role for BHB in limiting AD pathology. Fig. 1 AD patients have less BHB in their blood and brain parenchyma.

Endothelial cells of blood vessels in the brain express monocarboxylate transporters which mediate ketone body transport across the blood–brain barrier [33, 34]. In our study, BHB levels in the brain parenchyma of wild-type (WT) and 5XFAD mice were determined using a colorimetric ELISA.",1ccdb815-ec40-486c-8ec7-22b642717598
7,introduction7," BHB levels in WT and 5XFAD control mice were minimal, with no significant difference between the groups. In contrast, WT and 5XFAD mice receiving BHB-treated water showed significantly increased levels of BHB compared with control mice receiving regular water (P ≤ 0.0001; one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparison test), indicating exogenous BHB administration in water allowed BHB to effectively cross the blood–brain barrier (Fig. 2a).

No significant differences were observed between BHB-treated and untreated mice for plaque volume (Fig. 2e), plaque density (Fig. 2f) or plaque sphericity (Fig. 2i). The mechanism in which BHB reduces Aβ plaque formation remains unclear. Several studies in AD mouse models show reduced tau and amyloid pathologies by unknown mechanisms when mice are placed on a ketogenic diet or administered BHB [19, 20, 35].",9564738e-012b-420b-b87c-6cbbabeefdcb
10,introduction10," In cell culture models of AD, the addition of Aβ1–42 results in cell death caused by altered mitochondrial pyruvate activity, but can be rescued by the addition of BHB, which provides an alternative mitochondrial substrate when glucose is unavailable to be used as an energy source [31, 36, 37]. Additionally, the study by Yao and colleagues suggests dietary supplementation with 2-deoxy-d-glucose induces ketoacidosis, improves mitochondrial function, and attenuates Aβ pathology in a mouse model of AD [38]. These findings are validated by the observation that mitochondrial bioenergetics deficits are correlated with AD pathogenesis [39].  BHB treatment decreases microgliosis in 5XFAD mice Most likely due to decreased plaque-associated neuroinflammation, we observed a significant decrease in microgliosis in the BHB-treated 5XFAD mice when compared with the untreated controls (P ≤ 0.0001; one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparison test) (Fig. 3a).",75e084b3-58c7-48e7-805e-4372d6588571
11,introduction11," Closer examination revealed significantly decreased microglial clustering within 15 μm of plaque surfaces in 5XFAD mice treated with BHB when compared with untreated control mice (P = 0.0074; two-tailed Student’s t test) (Fig. 3b). The function of plaque-associated microgliosis in the context of AD remains unclear. For example, several groups suggest the microglia accumulation around plaques forms a protective barrier that may limit amyloid toxicity in the adjacent neurons [7, 11, 40]. In contrast, activated microglia release several proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6) and produce reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and many other proinflammatory molecules implicated in neurodegeneration in AD [41]. Furthermore, the study by Sonsa and colleagues suggests microglia may promote the seeding of plaques, as depletion of microglia results in a significant reduction in plaque pathology in a 5XFAD mouse model of AD [42].",4515563b-6588-4f10-9ffe-813473c798ee
12,introduction12," Therefore, inhibiting neuroinflammation, especially prior to microgliosis, may be a key attribute of BHB as a therapeutic agent for AD. Fig. 3 BHB treatment results in less pronounced microgliosis in 5XFAD mice. Brain sections were prepared as in Fig. 2.

(c) The box-counting method was used to calculate the fractal dimension of outlined versions of non-plaque-associated microglia (n = 3/image; 9 microglia/mouse) using FracLac for ImageJ.

13,introduction13," Microglia morphology is noticeably modified during disease, suggesting microglia strongly acclimate to local environments [43]. Morphologically, microglia are classified as ramified (resting), activated, and amoeboid (phagocytic) [8]. Broadly, ramified microglia tend to have moderate morphological complexity while amoeboid microglia have low complexity. Upon exposure to prolonged inflammation, activated microglia can enter a primed state where they promote an exaggerated inflammatory response that can contribute to neurodegeneration [44]. These primed microglia adopt a variety of morphologies, but tend to have higher complexity than resting microglia. Morphological changes in microglia have been observed in human AD patients [45] and in mouse models of AD [46–48], yet little is known about how microglial morphology correlates to AD pathology progression.",062f23fb-684f-4e9f-9e20-447d0fedf7b0
14,introduction14," Plaque-associated microglia usually display an amoeboid morphology, but one of the complicating factors in these studies is that microglia can feature more than one activation phenotype [49]. In our study, we specifically looked at morphological complexity in microglia which were not associated with plaques in order to analyze how reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation alters the amount of proinflammatory microglia on a systemic level. Fractal dimension analysis of microglia morphological complexity showed a distinct difference in the 5XFAD control mice, which took on a complex, primed morphology, when compared with 5XFAD BHB-treated mice (P = 0.0068; one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparison test), WT mice (P = 0.0002; one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparison test) and WT BHB-treated mice (P = 0.",be4f55b2-11d5-4237-94ac-33315b2960fd
15,introduction15,"0004; one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparison test), with the microglia from BHB-treated 5XFAD mice having a less complex, ramified morphology similar to those of the WT mice (Fig. 3c, d). Additionally, the microglia of BHB-treated 5XFAD mice were similar to the microglia of the WT and WT BHB mice in having a lower density, number of branches, and area than those of the 5XFAD group, further illustrating that BHB treatment shifts microglia away from a primed, proinflammatory morphology toward a less complex, resting morphology (Supplementary Table S1). This analysis showed BHB treatment of 5XFAD caused non-plaque-associated microglia to remain in a ramified, non-activated state, whereas 5XFAD control mice had microglia in a more complex, proinflammatory state.",1c9dbb5b-6037-49ca-bcfa-056ab87f8af0
16,introduction16," Overall, these data suggest BHB treatment leads to a reduction in the total number of microglia as well as a reduction in the amount of primed, proinflammatory microglia in non-plaque-associated regions, thereby reducing neuroinflammation-associated AD pathology.  BHB inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of the innate immune system that controls caspase-1 activation and the release of IL-1β and IL-18 in macrophages [50]. We first confirmed that BHB can inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM), by using the well-characterized NLRP3 activator, ATP [22]. In our hands, treatment of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) with 10-mM BHB inhibited NLRP3 activation as shown by significantly reduced levels of IL-1β (P ≤ 0.0001; two-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparison test) (Supplementary Fig. S1 A) and caspase-1 processing (P = 0.0021; two-tailed Student’s t test) (Supplementary Fig. S1 B and C).",f2a23516-cb97-4192-95da-1a0026409093
17,introduction17," Furthermore, treatment of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) with BHB did not alter cell function and viability as shown by similar levels of secretion of the proinflammatory chemokine KC (CXCL1) (Supplementary Fig. S1 D).  Consistent with a decrease in inflammasome activation, there were significantly fewer Asc specks in the 5XFAD mice treated with BHB (21.5 specks/HPF) than untreated 5XFAD mice (58 specks/HPF) (P = 0.0013; two-tailed Student’s t test) (Fig. 4a, b ). Additionally, BHB-treated 5XFAD mice had significantly less processed caspase-1 in their cortices compared with control mice (P = 0.0003; two-tailed Student’s t test) (Fig. 4c, d). 5XFAD BHB-treated mice also had significantly reduced levels of secreted IL-1β in their cortices compared with control mice (P ≤ 0.0001; one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparison test) (Fig. 4e).",6365e152-b1e9-4a03-858a-8f8da1adef3a
18,introduction18," Additionally, immunoblotting confirmed increased mature IL-1β secretion from the cortices of 5XFAD untreated control mice (Supplementary Fig. S2). Heneka and colleagues demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays a crucial role in Aβ plaque deposition by promoting release of Asc specks by microglia where they bind to Aβ and act as an inflammation-driven component of Aβ pathology [9, 13]. These data suggest inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome as a potential mechanism by which BHB attenuates AD pathogenesis. The mechanism by which BHB inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation, however, remains unclear. In macrophages, Youm and colleagues suggest that BHB inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome occurs independently of G protein-coupled receptor (Gpr109a) and starvation-related mechanisms and that BHB blocks NLRP3 inflammasome activation by regulating upstream events that prevent potassium efflux and reduce Asc speck formation [22].",3543c24d-b7fc-4c9a-82a8-3638ffa5526a
19,introduction19," In primary microglia, Deora and colleagues confirmed BHB inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by ATP and monosodium urate (monosodium urate (MSU)) crystals [51]. Surprisingly, BHB did not inhibit inflammasome activation by synuclein fibrils, suggesting inflammasome activation by synuclein fibrils, and potentially other pathological protein aggregates, occurs independently of the upstream events regulated by BHB described by Youm and colleagues [51]. These findings, however, do not rule out a neuroprotective role for BHB in neurons, which was also demonstrated in a mouse model of Aβ-induced AD-like pathology [31]. While the mechanism by which BHB inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains unclear, our data suggest that BHB inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation to attenuate AD pathology by reduced Asc speck formation, plaque nucleation, and inflammation.

21,introduction21," This study was based on basic research in human and mouse macrophages and suggests BHB as a potential therapeutic agent for NLRP3-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases [22].

We found that BHB-treated 5XFAD mice had fewer plaques and less pronounced microgliosis than untreated control mice. Importantly, BHB-treated 5XFAD mice had fewer Asc specks and less inflammasome activation in their cortices as indicated by reduced levels of processed caspase-1. Collectively, our data highlight the protective role of BHB-mediated inhibition of the inflammasome in AD.

31,methods9," Random images were taken of the cortices immediately dorsal to the hippocampus as previously described [3, 56]. Images were taken using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope at the University of Wisconsin Optical Imaging Core. Images were then processed with Imaris 9.2.1 (Bitplane).  Image analyses Quantification of plaque data was performed using the surface feature in Imaris. A complex three-dimensional surface object was created by defining an intensity threshold within the channel containing methoxy-X04. Defined surfaces were inspected to determine if they truly represented plaques. The average volume, sphericity, intensity, and number of these surfaces were calculated in Imaris. The percent of the image volume that these surfaces occupied was calculated by dividing the total volume of the surfaces by the total volume of the image. Two-dimensional maximum intensity projections of these images were exported to ImageJ [57, 58] where a binary threshold was set for the plaques.",44b4684a-27b7-45a8-8c52-cf64ce24658d
32,methods10," The percent of the image area that these plaques occupied was calculated using the “Particle Analysis” function.  Analysis of microglial position and localization around plaques was performed in Imaris using scripts from MATLAB (Mathworks). A colocalization channel was created between microglia in the Iba1 channel and the nuclei in the TO-PRO-3 channel. A spots object was then created by defining the intensity threshold within the colocalization channel. The total number of these spots were calculated in Imaris and represented the total number of microglia nuclei in the image. The average number of spots whose center fell within either 15 or 30 μm of the three-dimensional intensity-defined plaque surface were calculated using a modified version of the “Find Spot Close to Surface” MATLAB script.  To quantify the morphological differences in microglia between 5XFAD and WT mice with and without BHB treatment, fractal dimensions were calculated using the ImageJ plug-in FracLac.",d774b587-d955-4045-b591-79d39200f202
33,methods11," The fractal dimension is a value that is used to quantify complexity in a binary image by measuring how detail changes with a change in scale. For each mouse, there were three images taken and for each of those images, three microglia were selected (9 microglia analyzed per mouse). The three microglia that were selected were representative of the non-plaque associated microglia in an image. There were three parameters for selecting microglia for analysis: (1) The microglia must be greater than 30 μm away from the nearest plaque (to ensure that the microglia selected were non-plaque associated). (2) The microglia must be clearly distinguishable from its background (to make proper image analysis more accurate). (3) The selected microglia must be representative of the microglia population that meets the previous two criteria (so that abnormally complex or simple microglia are not selected).",2a729263-d09d-489a-8839-15363e44f9d2
34,methods12," Microglia from the population that met all three parameters were randomly chosen and further analyzed. Then, two-dimensional max intensity projections of these microglia were exported to ImageJ. A binary threshold was set for each microglia, and background interference was removed from the images. Outlined versions of each microglia were analyzed in FracLac (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fraclac/FLHelp/Introduction.htm) using the box-counting method to determine their fractal dimension. The averages of these fractal dimensions were used to compare the morphological differences between mice and their treatment. The “Skeletonize” function in ImageJ was used to obtain data regarding microglia processes characteristics that was also used to quantify morphological changes based on treatment groups.",53abfcf6-1256-4511-97a6-fbe972aa7da7
35,methods13,"  Cell culture assays To prepare bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM), tibias and femurs were removed from WT (C57BL/6J) mice, and flushed with RPMI 1640 supplemented with Glutamax, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated FBS (complete RPMI) and 20% L-cell conditioned medium (L cell conditioned medium (LCCM)). Cells were plated in petri dishes and cultured for 4–7 days prior to use. For inflammasome activation assays, 5 × 105 bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) were seeded per well in a 24-well tissue culture plate, primed with LPS (50 ng/ml) from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (Invivogen) for 4 h and stimulated with the NLRP3 activator, ATP (5 mM), for 1.5 h. BHB (Sigma, Cat. No. H6501) (10 mM) was added 4 h prior to inflammasome activation.",67432caf-0e0d-4afb-a7cc-c4cf5e27042b
