0,introduction0,"Traumatic brain injury (Traumatic brain injury (TBI)) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide 1. The primary injury leads to tissue disruption, loss of neuronal and non-neuronal cells, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and brain dysconnectivity 2. These changes underlie the functional sensorimotor and cognitive deficits seen post-trauma. At present there is no satisfactory treatment and furthermore, Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia 3 and is also associated with the risk of developing post-traumatic epilepsy 4.  In parallel with brain structure disruption, Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to altered cerebral energy metabolism. Under normal conditions, glucose is the main energy-producing source in the brain. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to an acute glucose hypermetabolism 5, followed by a prolonged cerebral glucose hypometabolism.",00c9db9b-06d4-4baa-95b0-b03b000d99a2
1,introduction1," Under these conditions, the brain can switch to the use of an alternative fuel, such as ketone bodies (KB) 5. KB, i.e. ß-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone, are synthesized from fatty acids in the liver. KBs can be produced under conditions of caloric restriction or during use of ketogenic diets (KDs). KDs are characterised by a high fat and low carbohydrate content, and their use leads to the development of a state of ketosis, i.e. increase in plasma and tissue KB levels 6. The KD dietary concept was first developed in the 1920s as a therapy for epilepsy and has been in clinical use worldwide as a non-pharmacological treatment option for treatment-resistant epilepsy 7. KD-based interventions are well- established in pediatric epilepsy 8 but less so in adult epilepsy 9.",ed420dac-6d2b-488f-b0ee-028c2ebea579
2,introduction2," They have significant efficacy in reducing seizures, but these fat-rich diets have low palatability and can lead to adverse effects, such as tiredness, excessive thirst, kidney stones and constipation, which significantly reduce patient compliance 10.  Apart from epilepsy, KD interventions have been shown to have neuroprotective potential in a variety of other neurological indications 9, 11, 12. However, in Traumatic brain injury (TBI) the experimental evidence generated in rodents so far with classical KD (with ratios of fat to protein and carbohydrate of 4:1 or higher), suggests that the neuroprotective effect of such an intervention would be limited to the protection of the juvenile brain only 13-15.  In the present study, we tested a new-KD formulation in an experimental model of Traumatic brain injury (TBI), the controlled cortical impact (controlled cortical impact (CCI)) model, in adult mice.",ddb80cf4-d0a1-46a5-b392-9663c4e98e7e
3,introduction3," The new-KD formulation contained medium-chain triglycerides (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)) and also the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), which has been shown to have intrinsic neuroprotective properties in Traumatic brain injury (TBI) 16, 17. It also contained low glycaemic index carbohydrates, fibres, and the ketogenic amino acid leucine, with a resulting overall ratio of fat to protein and carbohydrate of 2:1. We hypothesised that this composition would increase the neuroprotective effect of the diet, while maintaining its ketogenic potential and also increasing its palatability and reducing the adverse effects of the classical KD for more compliant use in patients. As the energy demise after Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs very rapidly, we fed the animals this diet immediately after injury and maintained them on it for 70 days, while monitoring their recovery.",5c0c8117-8318-417c-98cb-f293f034dd84
4,introduction4," We show that this new-KD formulation improves several aspects of neurological outcome and significantly counters the tissue damage and the increased inflammation and oxidation triggered by injury, and thus we present the first experimental evidence that a KD designed this way could confer neuroprotection in adult Traumatic brain injury (TBI).  ",b1d454f1-3aac-414b-9f93-9836687b68cb
5,methods0," We designed a new-KD with a fat to carbohydrate plus protein ratio of 2:1, containing medium chain triglycerides (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)), docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), low glycaemic index carbohydrates, fibres and the ketogenic amino acid leucine, and evaluated its neuroprotective potential in adult Traumatic brain injury (TBI). Adult male C57BL6 mice were injured by controlled cortical impact (controlled cortical impact (CCI)) and assessed for 70 days, during which they received a control diet or the new-KD.  Animals A total of 30 adult, 10-12 week-old male C57BL/6 mice, weighing 22-27 g (Charles River Laboratories, Margate, UK), were housed in groups of five, maintained the same throughout the study, in Individually Ventilated Cage (IVC; Allentown Europe, UK), in a 12 h light-dark cycle, with controlled room temperature (21 ± 1 °C) and relative humidity (40-60%) and with diet and water ad libitum.",9c4df8cb-8954-434c-b105-8fda2b5759e0
6,methods1," Health screens provided by the vendor indicated that animals were free of known pathogens in accordance with FELASA guidelines. A 7-day acclimatization phase occurred prior to the study. Food intake and body weight were monitored daily. All animal procedures were carried out under a Project Licence approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body, at Queen Mary University of London and the UK Home Office, in accordance with the EU Directive 2010/63/EUT.  Controlled cortical impact model A controlled cortical impact (controlled cortical impact (CCI)) Traumatic brain injury (TBI) model was used, as previously 18. After 1-week acclimatisation, mice were anaesthetized using ketamine (50 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg; i.p.). Mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame and a midline longitudinal incision was performed to expose the skull. A right lateral craniotomy was carried out using a pneumatic drill, 2.0 mm behind bregma and 2.5 mm lateral to the midline.",c973b8d0-2c54-4791-a80f-6ecc5b5ed401
7,methods2," controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury was induced using the following settings: a 3 mm impactor tip with a speed of 3 m/s, a depth of 2.2 mm and a dwell time of 100 ms, applied using the PCI3000 Precision Cortical Impactor™ (Hatteras Instruments, Inc., US). A control group underwent craniotomy only. After injury, the skull flap was placed back, to allow for expansion, and the skin was sutured. Mice were allowed to recover in an incubator (37°C) until fully awake and active. Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, s.c.) was used in all animals pre-operatively for pre-emptive analgesia and post-operatively every 12 h for 3 days post-surgery.  Dietary supplementation Following controlled cortical impact (CCI), mice were randomized into two groups and fed with a control diet ('controlled cortical impact (CCI)- Control'; n=10) or with the new preparation of a ketogenic diet (KD) ('controlled cortical impact (CCI)-KD'; n=10) for 70 days (detailed composition in Table 1).",e19e7215-dc33-44dd-8139-e065e0b966fe
8,methods3," The craniotomy group were fed with control diet (craniotomy; n=10). The diets were formulated by Danone Nutricia Research (Utrecht, The Netherlands) and manufactured by Ssniff (Soest, Germany). The caloric value of the control and new diet were 377 kcal/100g and 626 kcal/100g, respectively. The comparison between this diet and various other diets with variable ratios fat: carbohydrate and protein is shown in Table S1. Diets were stored at -20 °C to prevent lipid peroxidation, and fresh diet was given daily. No significant differences were seen in the body weight (Figure S1A) and food intake curves between the various experimental groups, throughout the study. All the behavioural work (the primary study endpoint) and tissue analysis, was assessed in “blind”, with the researcher unaware of the treatment, in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines 19.  Experimental design and Behavioural testing The testing carried out on various days post-injury (dpi) is summarised in Figure S1B.",5a3a68f9-eaf7-4a13-9e46-c319040b9551
9,methods4," Sample size was estimated using power analysis (https://eda.nc3rs.org.uk/eda/) for pairwise post-hoc comparisons after ANOVA, at a statistical power of 90%, with a significance level α < 0.05.  Modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) The mNSS was used as previously 20, 21, using a scoring based on the ability to perform ten tasks that evaluate motor ability, balance and alertness (Figure S2A). For each performance criterion, the animal can receive a score of 0 (no deficit) or 1 (deficit observed), on occasions 0-3 for increasing severity of deficit. The first mNSS was obtained 24 h after Traumatic brain injury (TBI). During the first week, testing was performed every other day, then once a week, until the end of the experiment.  Rotarod The Rotarod test (Ugo Basile, France; 3 cm diameter) was used for the evaluation of motor coordination and balance. Prior to surgery, mice were trained on the Rotarod for three consecutive days.",94d67b5e-3427-4228-be00-0f2d25d0c22d
10,methods5," The first two trials were 60 s each, at 3 rpm, followed by a single trial at accelerating speed (3 to 20 rpm over 300 s, with intervals of at least 25 min rest). The rest of the training days consisted of one trial at 3 rpm followed by two accelerating trials. The latency to fall from the Rotarod was recorded. The average of all accelerating phase scores was considered as the baseline (pre-injury score). Mice were tested during day 1-3 post- injury, in three trials a day, using the accelerating mode.  Morris Water Maze The Morris water maze test (Morris water maze test (MWM)) was used to assess memory associated with spatial learning between days 13-18 post-controlled cortical impact (CCI). A 100 cm diameter pool filled with opaque water at 23 °C was placed inside a white tent, ensuring light uniformity, with 4 visible cues hung 10 cm from the pool walls and a 11 cm diameter Plexiglas resting platform submerged 0.5 cm below water level. Swimming performance (e.g.",7d8ca397-bd78-4dec-98c4-2f5f867c287f
11,methods6," path, distance, speed and latency) was tracked using software (ANYmaze, Smart, Bioseb, France). A learning period of 5 consecutive days (days 13-17 post-injury) and a probe trial on day 6 (day 18 post-injury) were used. During the learning period, each mouse was subjected to 4 trials a day, in the pool divided into 4 virtual quadrants. The position of the platform was constant throughout the training session, while the starting position on each of the 4 training trials was changed. If a mouse did not find the platform within 60 s, it was guided to it. After reaching the platform, mice were allowed to stay there for 15 s. During the probe trial, mice were allowed to swim for 60 s in the absence of the platform, and the time it took to first enter the quadrant that had previously hosted the platform, was measured.  BrdU injections From day 63 post-injury or craniotomy, and for 7 sequential days, animals received i.p.",e4037d0e-3b68-4625-9fd6-23c083d8af56

Histology and immunohistochemistry At day 70 post-Traumatic brain injury (TBI), 5 animals from each group were deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.; Sagatal, Rhone Merieux, Harlow, UK), and received a transcardiac perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.01 M, pH 7.4), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (paraformaldehyde (PFA)) in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4, 4 °C). The brains were dissected out, fixed and paraffin-blocked for histology and immunohistochemistry (immunohistochemistry (IHC)) analyses. 7 μm sections were deparaffinised and hydrated (xylene and ethanol). Sections were subjected to antigen retrieval (10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0, 30 min at 80 °C), then cooled at room temperature. The tissue was blocked with 5% normal donkey serum in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for an hour, followed by three PBS washes.",2499b72f-9f57-4d73-80ba-9faef6cf122d

The antibody was diluted using diluent with background reducing components (Dako, CAT #S3022).  For calculation of the lesion size, sections of 7 µm, 200 μm apart and spanning the entire rostro-caudal extent of the injured cortex were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The lesion size was measured with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) and calculated using the equation: the contralateral (non-lesioned) hemisphere size minus the injured hemisphere size and divided by the contralateral hemisphere size (Swanson et al, 1990). The results are expressed as a percentage of hemispheric tissue.  Image capture analysis and processing Four sections per animal were stained, per antibody. At least 24 fields/section were captured peri-lesionally (immediate area around the lesion).",16cc2a02-6fa3-4083-bf19-f2121ef98304
15,methods10," Images were viewed at ×40 and photographed using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope with a Hamamatsu camera (C4742-95). Analyses were carried out by thresholding and then superimposed on nuclei, for co- localization using a dedicated script (JVP AutoColourCellCountsRev) in ImageJ (ImageJ 1.50i, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland). Quantification of microglia morphology was carried out using cell size in ImageJ (minimum 20 cells per animal). The soma perimeter was measured excluding the processes. A Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope was used for further characterization (ZENlite software; Zeiss, Cambridge, UK). Figures were prepared using Illustrator software (Adobe Illustrator CS6).  Brain tissue preparations Brain tissue from 5 animals per group were used for western blot analysis, phospholipid analysis and the H3 Methylation/Acetylation assay.

The contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres were separated. Tissue was snap frozen and stored at -80 °C.  Western blot analysis A cube of the right hemisphere around the lesion was dissected and sonicated in RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) complete with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), then centrifuged (10,000 x g, 10 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was taken. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein (50 µg) were mixed with NuPAGE® LDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and dithiothreitol (dithiothreitol (DTT)) and boiled (95 °C, 10 min), then separated using Mini-Protean TGX Gels, 10% (Biorad, UK) and electro-transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Biotrace).

KD supplemented animals show a significant reduction in lesion size, a decrease in an oxidation marker and changes in brain PL levels Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with rapid loss of grey and white matter that contributes to the overall brain volume loss seen post-traumatically 24. Traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced cell loss is associated with necrosis and apoptosis, followed by the removal of cell debris by microglia and macrophages. Analysis of the lesion size after 70 dpi showed a significant loss of tissue, with almost total loss of the ipsilateral hippocampus.

KD supplementation leads to a decrease in microglia/macrophage activation but does not alter the astrocyte response post-injury Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is followed by intense activation of a microglia and macrophage response. This activation is reflected in morphological changes and is one of the hallmarks of Traumatic brain injury (TBI) pathophysiology 27. Microglia, the resident brain immune cells, undergo a transition from a resting state- ramified morphology to an amoeboid morphology, which reflects the activated state.",1d802224-be18-4d8b-8cf8-6d968d3145a0

Next, we explored the microglia/macrophage morphological differences between the controlled cortical impact (CCI)-Control diet group (predominantly amoeboid), the controlled cortical impact (CCI)-KD group (less amoeboid) and craniotomy-control group (predominantly ramified) by measuring cell size.",1fec97da-0d27-4a2e-a8a5-6e99edfe61b2
31,results9," Microglia cells in the controlled cortical impact (CCI)-Control diet group were significantly bigger compared with the controlled cortical impact (CCI)-KD diet group (Mann Whitney test p = 0.008; Figure 4D).  In response to Traumatic brain injury (TBI), astrocytes become reactive 31. The astrogliotic reactivity is reflected in both proliferation and cell hypertrophy. After a traumatic injury, astrocytes can exert both harmful and protective effects, e.g. ablation of astrocytes soon after brain injury in mice, led to a poorer outcome, suggesting an important protective role of astrocytes after injury 32, 33.  controlled cortical impact (CCI) led to an increase in the percentage of the positive astrocyte marker- glial fibrillary acidic protein (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)), out of total DAPI - around the lesion border, with no differences between the control diet and the new-KD diet groups (One-Way ANOVA; p < 0.0001, F (2, 10) = 118.8; Figure 5A, b, f, j).",17dfbdea-fa15-491a-8790-325f32236363
32,results10," Additionally, in both diets, after Traumatic brain injury (TBI), there was an increase in newly- formed astrocytes, i.e. cells double-labelled with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and BrdU, at 70 dpi (One-Way ANOVA; p = 0.005, F (2, 10) = 9.652; Figure 5C, d, h, l).  KD supplementation modulates cell proliferation after controlled cortical impact (CCI) Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with an increase in cell proliferation, including an induction of neurogenesis 34 35, processes which are interpreted as repair mechanisms. New-born cells are detected not only in the neurogenic areas of the brain (such as the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus or the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles), but also in the perilesional area, and in contralateral hemisphere regions such as the hippocampus.",0d2565b0-331b-47de-b8cd-e2d76e3c6332
33,results11," The analysis of proliferating cells after controlled cortical impact (CCI) around the lesion, showed a significantly higher percentage of BrdU-positive cells compared to the craniotomy group. The treatment with KD led to a noticeably increased perilesional cell proliferation (One-way ANOVA; p < 0.0001, F (2, 12) = 23.71; Figure 5B, c, g, k).  KD supplementation leads to the protection of oligodendrocytes after controlled cortical impact (CCI) Oligodendrocytes are responsible for producing myelin and maintaining myelinated fibres in the brain. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) alters the response of both mature oligodendrocytes and immature proliferative oligodendrocytes 36. We show that the controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury led to a significant reduction in the percentage of oligodendrocytes, labelled with adenomatous polyposis coli (adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)) out of total DAPI, perilesionally.",00a18623-226d-4a29-9ee5-ff9af026e227
34,results12," This injury-induced decrease was significantly affected by the new-KD (One-Way ANOVA; p = 0.005, F (2, 12) = 8.563; Figure 6A, b, f, j). In addition, dual staining of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and BrdU showed a higher percentage of double-stained adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)/BrdU cells in the controlled cortical impact (CCI)-KD group compared with the two other groups (controlled cortical impact (CCI)-Control 2.4±0.35; controlled cortical impact (CCI)-KD 4.1±0.38; Craniotomy 1.4±0.2; One-way ANOVA; p = 0.002, F (2, 12) = 18.15; Figure 6B, d, h, l).  KD modulates mTOR signalling and alters the mitochondrial marker NDUFS4 levels after controlled cortical impact (CCI) The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase that integrates energy, nutrient and growth factor signals to regulate various cellular functions, when activated. It is part of two distinct multi-protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2.",40a99a73-e329-4048-9655-e395aef2f66a
35,results13," The activation of mTOR has been associated with repair mechanisms after neural injury 37, 38. One of the downstream signalling effectors in the mTORC1 pathway is p70S6k (ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1). There is an increase in the levels of phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR) in the injured tissue and the new-KD further amplified this response to injury. Thus, the ratio of p-mTOR/mTOR, at 70 days after injury, significantly increased in the controlled cortical impact (CCI)-KD group compared to both controlled cortical impact (CCI)-control and craniotomy groups (1.34±0.08 vs. 0.75±0.07 and 0.34±0.05 respectively; One-Way ANOVA ***p<0.0001, F (2,12) = 51.26; Figure 7C). The new-KD also increased the level of the mTORC1 downstream effector p70S6k in its phosphorylated form at 70 days post injury compared to the controlled cortical impact (CCI)-Control and craniotomy groups (p-mTOR: One-Way ANOVA; p = 0.001, F (2, 11) = 37.44; Figure 7A, B and p70S6k: One-Way ANOVA; p = 0.001, F (2, 7) = 44.",c4f7c9db-9c6a-4de8-8057-94d37ae9c472
36,results14,"72; Figure 7D).  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces acutely a significant mitochondrial dysfunction 39. The protein NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 4 (NDUFS4) is an accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (complex I). It is a membrane protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and it is part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that plays a vital role in cellular ATP production. At 70 days post-injury we detected a marked increase in NDUFS4, and the levels of this mitochondrial marker NDUFS4 in the perilesional area were reduced in the injured mice receiving the new- KD (One-Way ANOVA; p = 0.0006, F (2, 9) = 19.18; Figure 8A).  KD modulates H3K9 methylation and acetylation In the last decade, evidence has been accumulating that ketones can induce epigenetic modifications, such as increased histone acetylation and DNA methylation 40.",987b5c50-fea8-403a-9a13-ef65aa2a7072
37,results15," A strong effect of the new-KD was observed on both histone H3K9 methylation and acetylation compared with the controlled cortical impact (CCI)-Control and craniotomy groups (One-Way ANOVA; p = 0.0004, F (3, 15) = 11.33; Figure 8B and One-Way ANOVA; p < 0.0001, F (3, 15) = 20.71; Figure 8C respectively).  Discussion and Conclusion In this study, we carried out a Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in adult mice using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model - which was previously shown to be insensitive in adult animals to ketogenic dietary intervention 13 and fed the animals a new-KD for 70 days post-injury, while assessing the neurological outcome. The controlled cortical impact (CCI) model involved replacing of the bone flap and allowing expansion, therefore the observations presented with this new diet can be interpreted as reflecting a clinical situation where there is control of the acute rise in intracranial pressure following a severe injury.",c42f7bd3-b423-4e25-9171-b1c9a9fdb5bc
38,results16," We also examined the brain tissue at the end of the experiment, for signs of neuroprotection. We present evidence that a new ketogenic formulation given immediately post Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in adult animals can lead to functional neurological benefits and can reduce the injury impact on brain tissue. This new preparation has a lower fat to carbohydrate and protein ratio, i.e. a ratio of 2:1 vs. a ratio of 4:1, which is characteristic of classical KD formulations, and includes medium chain triglycerides (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)), docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) and leucine. It is also higher in protein, fibres and carbohydrates with low glycaemic index, compared with the classic KD.  Intervention with this novel KD formulation reduced sensorimotor impairment, including coordination and balance, and improved spatial memory recovery after injury. Tissue loss post-injury is linked to the sensorimotor and cognitive deficits seen after injury 41.",17fa3760-ceb4-440a-a491-e50b8fa2a9bb
39,results17," The brain lesion size was significantly decreased in the new-KD group compared to the injured animals on control diet, and the PL loss in tissue following injury was also attenuated.  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) initiates a series of neurochemical events that compromise cerebral energy metabolism. This metabolic disruption requires high cellular energy to reinstate homeostasis. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to a transient “hyperglycolysis” phase (possibly associated with the acute post-injury increase in hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha 42), followed by a prolonged period of metabolic depression, during which glucose utilisation drops dramatically. Although glucose serves as the main metabolic substrate for neurons, it has been shown that other energy-producing substrates, such as lactate and pyruvate, might be utilized by neurons to sustain their activity 15.",f100791d-c65b-4889-88e7-c1e6dfebafe5
40,results18," In addition to glucose metabolism, all cell types in the brain are capable to metabolise ketone bodies when present, and ketones are capable of fulfilling the energy requirements of the brain. Ketosis, reflected in elevated β-HB plasma levels, can be achieved by following a high-fat, low-carbohydrate classical KD that acts as a provider of alternative substrates for cerebral energy metabolism 6. We show here that the β-HB plasma levels were significantly higher in the injured group fed with the new-KD, emphasising the fact that this formulation can lead to a state of ketosis, although the ketogenic ratio is lower than in the classical KD. The β-HB level we measured is in the range reported in previous studies with KD formulations in rats and mice 43-45.  The new-KD modified the neuroinflammation reaction post-injury, i.e. it reduced activated microglia peri-lesionally.",ddb48e28-bbbc-49cf-8793-241464eeeed0
41,results19," Numerous studies have reported that post-injury changes in the microglia functional state are associated with the de novo expression of the mitochondrial translocator protein (translocator protein (TSPO)). Post-Traumatic brain injury (TBI), there is an increase in translocator protein (TSPO) levels 46, 47. Here we show that injured animals fed with the new-KD had a significantly reduced translocator protein (TSPO) expression in Iba-1 expressing cells compared with the injured animals fed with a control diet, at 70 days post-controlled cortical impact (CCI).  One other component of the glial response after Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is represented by astrocytic activation. Astrocytes respond to mechanical strain and to the ATP released from injured cells at the injury site, which triggers astrocyte activation and recruits them to the site of injury.",eb691aff-f436-44c6-83ce-b8231b22f8bc
42,results20," In response to a focal injury, reactive astrocytes form a scar border that isolates the damaged and inflamed tissue from the healthy tissue 48-50. These scar borders are comprised almost entirely of newly proliferated astrocytes, which may subsequently contribute to tissue repair/regeneration 33, 51. The present study indicates a strong astrocytic activation at more than 2 months after injury, as reflected by the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) marker, and also shows an increase in the numbers of newly-born astrocytes even at this late time post-injury, but with no differences between the control diet and the new-KD treated groups.  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers loss of oligodendrocytes and demyelination, and there is a relationship between white matter loss and post-traumatic cognitive impairment 52, 53.",fde1ed7d-ca88-4d62-a707-ff7aed4c9a67
43,results21," The current findings confirm the oligodendrocyte vulnerability after traumatic injury and indicate a protection of oligodendrocytes and also an increase in the newly formed oligodendrocyte pool along the lesion border, by the new-KD. As previously shown, controlled cortical impact (CCI) leads to a detectable decrease in PL species at this time point after injury 54. The new-KD reduced the decrease in PC and PE, but, overall, the impact on PL loss in tissue was not as marked as the impact of a dietary supplementation with a combination of brain phospholipid precursors 54.  Studies on KD have shown that these fat-rich and carbohydrate-poor diets can induce epigenetic alterations, and it is interesting to note that epigenetic changes such as increased histone acetylation have been associated with improved learning and memory, while decreased acetylation is associated with cognitive impairment such as that seen during ageing 55, 56.",bf870be5-580f-490f-93b3-64298359f2e5
44,results22," Gao and colleagues 57 have reported decreases in histone acetylation and methylation after Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the immature brain. Our new-KD induced a marked increase in histone acetylation and in histone methylation, therefore it could be suggested that this epigenetic modulatory effect might be beneficial post-Traumatic brain injury (TBI).  Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event post-trauma, and is a critical determinant of energy failure and cellular demise 58. Mitochondria disruption is also a key link to increased oxidative stress 59, which appears to be reduced by the new-KD in the injured controlled cortical impact (CCI) tissue.  Interestingly, our results show that injury leads to an increase in the tissue expression of the mitochondrial marker NDUFS4, and the new-KD significantly dampened this increase. The knockout of NDUFS4 in the heart has been shown to be protective in reperfusion injury following heart ischaemia 60.",3597f330-d86b-4e7a-8e55-7770cea0c758
45,results23," Furthermore, it has been shown that the activation state of mitochondrial complex I is linked to reperfusion injury and oxidative stress post-ischaemia 61. An improved understanding of the impact of the new-KD on brain mitochondria at this time after injury and a comprehensive interpretation of these first observations on the complex I marker, would be greatly aided by functional measures on fresh mitochondria isolated from the injured tissue, and a characterization of the transitions between conformational states (active vs. de-active and catalytically dormant) of complex I, as reported in recent studies in a murine model of immature hypoxia-ischaemia encephalopathy 62.  One of the changes reported in studies with KD in the context of epilepsy is an inhibition of mTOR 63, a signalling pathway whose activation is linked to epileptogenesis. It has been suggested that this inhibitory effect may be linked to the impact of KD on growth and also its anticonvulsant properties.",3f894695-70c8-461d-89e5-f2c5cad523bc
46,results24," It has been shown that Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to a fast activation of mTORC1, and suppression of this initial activation may be beneficial 64. We show that controlled cortical impact (CCI) in mice led in the long-term to an activation of mTOR (as reflected in the increase in p-mTOR), and this was enhanced by the new-KD, after 70 days of exposure to this diet. This enhancement in signalling was supported by the observed increase in phosphorylated p70S6k. It is tempting to suggest that this effect, which is reported for the first time after traumatic central nervous system injury, may be linked to beneficial effects of mTOR activation on compensatory brain plasticity post-injury and recovery of cognitive function 65, 66; effects which are thus clearly opposite to the deleterious impact of mTOR activation in the acute phase.",7205c549-f1d8-49e7-aa40-2cbe16168d08
47,results25," Although the new protein synthesis which would be involved in endogenous attempts to restore brain connectivity may not be exclusively under the control of mTOR (in particular mTORC1), this signalling pathway may still make a significant contribution to the reduction of the lesion and the inherent brain circuit remodelling involved in improved neurological performance.  Interestingly, an increase in mTOR activation has also been reported after chronic exposure to a KD treatment which induced neuroprotection in a model of optic neuropathy 67. In the present study, it is likely that the addition of leucine to the new-KD may have contributed to this effect. It would be interesting to assess in future studies whether the early post-injury effect of the new diet is to inhibit mTOR, whereas in time, the effect becomes opposite, and leads to stimulation of mTOR, which supports neurorepair.",d73916d8-9472-4b71-8dda-8d8ab5f81493
48,results26,"  Overall, we show evidence in the present study that it is possible to characterize significant neuroprotective properties of a KD following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in an adult brain, using a new-KD formulation with a fat to carbohydrate and protein ratio which is also likely to be associated with an improved tolerability, and also enriched in omega-3 fatty acids, in particular, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which has been shown to have intrinsic neuroprotective value in Traumatic brain injury (TBI). With reference to the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) diet content of our new diet (1430 mg/100 g diet), it is interesting to note that Pu and collaborators 68 administered for 35 days a diet enriched in fish oil (4000 mg fish oil/100 g diet, containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)); eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA):docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ratio of 2.",9c4ae33d-4092-4330-9aa4-e88c88892008

As our first exploratory study was focused on the proof of principle for the whole diet, it is not possible to establish which diet component made the most critical contribution to the benefits seen on various endpoints, and this will need to be addressed with priority in future studies, to refine further the composition of the diet and better understand mechanistically its mode of action. Future studies could help assess whether the beneficial long-term effects of the new diet are supported by very early neuroprotective mechanisms triggered in the first hours or day post-injury by the diet.",2a0c4ac3-fe6f-4f2c-9b05-a99466595465
50,results28," This is the first evidence which suggests that a KD approach could be used in human adult Traumatic brain injury (TBI), expanding the range of potential clinical uses of this dietary KD principle 69 in an indication where there is a need to move away from glucose as a fuel and also avoid hyperglycaemia 70, which is a modifiable risk factor contributing to poor outcome in Traumatic brain injury (TBI) 71. How this dietary paradigm could be implemented post-trauma in the context of human Traumatic brain injury (TBI), and the exact dietary regime parameters, i.e. optimum onset and duration of the intervention, remain to be clarified in further studies.
