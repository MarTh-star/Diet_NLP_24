0,abstract0," The causes of the decline in skeletal muscle mass and function with age, known as sarcopenia, are poorly understood. Nutrition (calorie restriction) interventions impact many cellular processes and increase lifespan and preserve muscle mass and function with age. As we previously observed an increase in life span and muscle function in aging mice on a ketogenic diet (KD), we aimed to investigate the effect of a KD on the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass with age and the potential molecular mechanisms of this action. Twelve‐month‐old mice were assigned to an isocaloric control or KD until 16 or 26 months of age, at which time skeletal muscle was collected for evaluating mass, morphology, and biochemical properties. Skeletal muscle mass was significantly greater at 26 months in the gastrocnemius of mice on the KD.",49ac59ca-d5d5-4e63-bf98-6bd622a653c9
1,abstract1," This result in KD mice was associated with a shift in fiber type from type IIb to IIa fibers and a range of molecular parameters including increased markers of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) remodeling, mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative metabolism, and antioxidant capacity, while decreasing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, protein synthesis, and proteasome activity. Overall, this study shows the effectiveness of a long‐term KD in mitigating sarcopenia. The diet preferentially preserved oxidative muscle fibers and improved mitochondrial and antioxidant capacity. These adaptations may result in a healthier cellular environment, decreasing oxidative and ER stress resulting in less protein turnover. These shifts allow mice to better maintain muscle mass and function with age.  Nutrition interventions impact the preservation of skeletal muscle mass and function with age. This study demonstrated that the ketogenic diet (KD) improved skeletal muscle mass preservation with age.",1b78f1ab-eeda-4e4e-b729-63e033f13b7b

The incidence of sarcopenia is reported to range from 14% in 65–69 year‐olds to 50% in the 80+ population (Janssen, 2010).",e15981ab-6c35-4af4-9b50-aa175eb23abc
3,abstract3," Sarcopenia reduces the ability to perform activities of daily living and contributes to a loss of mobility and independence, as well as an increased risk of frailty, falls, morbidity and mortality. The loss of muscle mass with aging results from a decrease in both muscle fiber number and fiber cross‐sectional area . However, the exact processes that underpin the development of sarcopenia are not completely understood. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain sarcopenia including: neuromuscular junction instability , mitochondrial dysfunction , endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Baehr et al., 2016; Deldicque, 2013), oxidative stress (Deepa et al., 2019; Sullivan‐Gunn & Lewandowski, 2013), inflammation , anabolic resistance (Breen & Phillips, 2011), protein malnutrition (Phillips & Martinson, 2019; Robinson et al.",2b8cfe4b-a9ce-4a0d-93fb-6a9cb105b857
4,abstract4,", 2018), and the dysregulation of proteostasis (Murton, 2015). As the global population is aging rapidly, it is critical to uncover the mechanisms responsible for the loss of muscle with aging and develop strategies to slow the progression of or prevent sarcopenia.  Sarcopenia can be greatly accelerated by lifestyle choices, such as physical inactivity and poor nutrition . Nutrition is widely recognized as an effective intervention to reduce the loss of muscle mass and function and prolong independence and quality of life. Calorie restriction (CR) without malnutrition is considered one of the most powerful anti‐aging interventions and has been shown to extend both mean and maximum lifespan in multiple species (Redman & Ravussin, 2011). In skeletal muscle, CR delays the onset and slows the progression of sarcopenia .",1e23c60b-52ba-420e-8718-210da8d413f8
5,abstract5," The exact mechanisms as to how CR preserves muscle mass with aging are still unclear; however, the shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism and increased ketone levels is one mechanism hypothesized to underlie these benefits .  Protein restriction also can lead to prolongation of lifespan in model organisms and decreases mortality in people under 65 years old . Unlike caloric restriction, protein restriction results in a conserved decrease in insulin‐like growth factor (IGF)‐1 levels  and the activity of the IGF‐1/akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway  leading to a decrease in tumor growth . However, a prolonged decrease in dietary protein may result in the acceleration of sarcopenia (the age‐dependent loss of muscle mass in the absence of disease) in humans (Phillips & Martinson, 2019; Robinson et al., 2018).",92cd5231-b2a9-439d-ad6c-471b715bb337
6,abstract6," In fact, older men need greater dietary protein levels to achieve the same amount of muscle protein synthesis  leading many to suggest that increased protein intake may be required in older humans to prolong lifespan .  Very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diets (KD) may provide the effects of both caloric restriction, shifting metabolism from carbohydrates toward fatty acids, and protein restriction, decreasing global AKT/mTORC1 signaling. Consequently, we  and others  have shown that a KD increases life and health span in mice, while the ketone, β‐hydroxybutyrate (BHB), increases life span in C. elegans . In addition to its traditional role in energy metabolism, BHB has also been shown to act as a signaling molecule . Mechanistically, the KD or ketone bodies have been suggested to be neuroprotective (Maalouf et al.",db49793f-10c2-4848-8b31-bfdc234016ea
7,abstract7,", 2009), improve mitochondrial content and function , reduce insulin/insulin‐like growth factor (IGF‐1) signaling , activate autophagy , increase antioxidants (Milder & Patel, 2012), and have anti‐inflammatory effects ; all of which may influence skeletal muscle aging.  We recently observed a preservation of motor function in aging mice consuming a KD compared to a standard control diet . This preservation of motor function was associated with higher relative weights of several hind limb muscles in old mice on the KD. In humans, the KD has a protective effect on muscle mass compared to a low‐fat diet during weight loss in the absence of exercise .",686d82c4-f1d4-417f-89fa-e04d91645866
8,abstract8," There is currently limited knowledge about the effect of the KD on cellular mechanisms in skeletal muscle, although prior investigations in young rodents have demonstrated a rise in markers of mitochondrial content and biogenesis , an increase in antioxidant protein expression  and a decrease in young (5 months) but an increase in old (28 months) rats in relation to anabolic signaling through the mTOR pathway . How long‐term adaptation to the KD, at a molecular level, affects aging skeletal muscle remains unknown.  The present study extended our previous work to compare the effect of isocaloric standard control (control (CON)) or ketogenic diet (KD) initiated in mid‐life (12 months of age) on skeletal muscle of male C57BL/6 J mice. Muscles from mice maintained on a control or ketogenic diet for 14 months in our original study were compared with a new group of animals who were on the diets for 4 months.",b0d24c90-1882-4566-88f8-1f3fccbbff45

No differences in body weight were observed with age or diet (data not shown). There was a main effect of age in that all relative muscle weights decreased with age, except for the TA (Figure 1a).

The greater Chrng expression was higher still with the KD, while there was a trend for greater Chrnd and Chrne expression on a KD when compared to control (CON) at 26 months. These data suggest that neuronal remodeling increases with age and may be amplified by a KD.  2.3 Mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism  To determine the effect of diet and age on mitochondrial biogenesis, we investigated the expression and levels of several transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis in the gastrocnemius (GTN) muscle. There was a main effect of age for the expression of all measured regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis in that the expression of these regulators increased with age (Figure 3a).",756ea28f-b982-4142-8eeb-0bbf66a4a1ae

Interestingly, even with the increased level of markers of mitochondrial biogenesis the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis was lower in the KD compared to control (CON) in 16‐month‐old mice (Figure 5a).  To determine the effect of diet and age on oxidative metabolism we investigated the activity and level of key metabolic enzymes. The level of several proteins within the electron transfer chain (oxidative phosphorylation; of mitochondrial biogenesis (d e) oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)), including NDUFB8, UQCRC2, MTCO1, and ATP5A (from complexes I, III, IV, and V, respectively) was significantly higher in the KD group when compared to control (CON) at 26 months (Figure 3d–e).",52582cf3-9463-49c0-9b7d-cc0955804d8a

For the complex II protein, SDHB, we only detected a significant increase from 16 to 26 months for KD (Figure 5b,c). Consistent with the protein data, the activity of the key Kreb's Cycle enzyme, citrate synthase, was significantly higher in the KD group when compared to control (CON) at both 16 and 26 months (Figure 3f). Citrate synthase activity also increased from 16 to 26 months for both diets. These data suggest that mitochondrial mass and function increase between 16 and 26 months of age in gastrocnemius (GTN) and that this increase is amplified by a KD.  2.4 Cellular stress responses  To determine the effect of diet and age on the ER stress response, we measured the level of key ER stress proteins (Figure 4a,b).",cda8c28d-f78a-4bf7-99cb-9e71098eb494

30,results20," There was a main effect of age on 20S β1, β2, β5 and 26S β1, β5 activity, in that proteasome activity increased between 16 and 26 months of age. We observed a main effect of diet for β5 activity, with the activity of these subunits being lower in the KD group. The activity of 20S β5 increases for both control (CON) and KD between 16 and 26 months; however, mice on the control (CON) diet showed significantly higher activity at 26 months when compared with KD. At 26 months, the activity of the 26 β5 subunit was significantly elevated in control (CON) when compared to KD, this level was also significantly higher when compared to control (CON) at 16 months.  As the autophagy degradation system is another system that regulates protein breakdown, we set out to determine the effect of diet and age on the levels of autophagy‐related markers (Figure 5e,f). There was no effect of diet or age on the levels of ATG7.",b0d4f56a-3646-4a7a-ba17-00893c1f41c0
31,results21," There was a main effect of age on LC3B protein levels, in that LC3B‐I was higher and LC3B‐II and the LC3B‐II to LC3B‐I ratio were lower with age (suggesting decreased autophagy with age). There was no effect of diet on LC3B levels. From 16 to 26 months, there was a significant increase in LC3B‐I levels for control (CON), whereas there was a decrease in the level of LC3B‐II for KD. When analyzing the LC3B‐II to LC3B‐I ratio, we observed a significant decrease between 16 and 26 months for both diets. There was a main effect of age and diet on FOXO1 and FOXO3A levels, with age decreasing FOXO1 and increasing FOXO3A, while both FOXO1 and FOXO3A were increased with the KD.

33,discussion0,"  The objective of this study was to begin identifying mechanisms whereby a KD results in the preservation of skeletal muscle mass and function with age in mice. Our data, using either 4 or 14 months on an 11.2 kcal/day standard control or KD, suggest that a KD results in preservation of skeletal muscle mass concomitant with a decrease in type IIb and increase in type IIa fiber area. At the molecular level, the KD increased markers of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) turnover, mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative metabolism, and oxidative stress response, while decreasing ER stress, protein synthesis, and proteasome activity. Together, these data suggest that a KD results in a healthier cellular environment, decreasing the need for protein turnover and ER stress. However, what is most clear from our data is that no single molecular target drives the improvement in muscle function on this diet.  3.",143d6bb4-4604-4f27-ba09-55ada9813057
34,discussion1,"1 Skeletal muscle weight, fiber size and type  Skeletal muscle mass was better maintained in 26‐month‐old mice fed a KD compared to control (CON) diet. Together with the increase in grip strength and wire hang performance previously reported in this cohort of animals , this indicates that muscle mass and function are improved on a long‐term KD. The fact that the grip strength and wire hang used previously focus on forearm muscle and the improved muscle mass observed in the current study focused on the hindlimb muscles, suggests that a KD influences muscle throughout the body. The improved muscle mass observed in the current work is similar to a recent study showing ketone diesters mitigate cachexic muscle loss . Furthermore, this maintenance of muscle mass was biased within more oxidative (type IIa) fibers at the expense of type IIb fiber area.",7c11a2c7-6f4c-4b3b-8f9f-9e60231e4bdf
35,discussion2," This shift in fiber type area is important because in humans the loss of IIa fiber cross‐sectional area (CSA) could explain the loss of muscle size and strength with age . It is unclear whether preferential sparing of oxidative fibers was due to a loss in glycolytic fibers, a fiber‐type shift from glycolytic to oxidative fiber types as a result of an increased reliance on fat as a fuel, or enhanced reinnervation of IIb fibers by type I, IIa, or IIx motor neurons. Based on our data, we hypothesize that there was an increase in axonal sprouting and fiber grouping and together with the shift in fuel utilization required to sustain a KD (i.e., increased aerobic respiration and beta‐oxidation), this led to preservation of oxidative fibers over glycolytic ones .  3.",350a462c-5617-4be4-9775-6b2cd713622d
36,discussion3,"2 Neuromuscular junction remodeling  One theory for the progressive loss of muscle fiber cross‐sectional area (CSA) and number is based on progressive cycles of denervation and reinnervation that muscle fibers undergo during aging . This theory posits a neurogenic basis for fiber loss resulting from neuromuscular fragility and progressive reinnervation by axonal sprouting from an adjacent motor neuron. In fact, individuals where axonal sprouting was increased, as measured through expanded motor unit size, were less likely to be sarcopenic than those whose motor unit size remained small . In support of the theory that axonal sprouting improves muscle mass and function with age, masters athletes showed greater reinnervation capacity than an age‐matched frail elderly group . Sonjak and colleagues concluded that the difference in age‐related muscle function was related to the robustness of the reinnervation response.",18817cc7-ee44-4503-b856-9eb1e533dc53
37,discussion4," In the current study, we observed more fiber clustering (type IIa) in animals on a KD, which is typically the result of increased axonal sprouting. The increase in axonal sprouting was seen even though the expression of genes associated with denervation was augmented by the KD. These results suggest that the preservation of muscle mass and function observed with a KD is not the result of a reduction in the rate of fiber denervation but that reinnervation through axonal sprouting of IIa nerves may contribute to improved muscle function.  3.3 Mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism  Skeletal muscle aging and the onset of sarcopenia has been shown to be driven metabolically through disruptions in mitochondrial function . It is important to note that markers of mitochondrial mass (i.e., levels of of mitochondrial biogenesis (d e) oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins) and function (i.e.",ea20f302-172c-4b10-aaaf-d00425b4ec69
38,discussion5,", citrate synthase activity) increased between 16 and 26 months in the current study. Even though this went contrary to our hypothesis, an increase in mitochondrial protein synthesis with age has been reported previously . Beyond the effect of age, citrate synthase activity improved even more as a result of the forced metabolic shift of a short‐term (4 months: 16‐month‐old) or long‐term (14 months: 26‐month‐old) KD. The KD led to multiple intracellular signals converging to drive markers of mitochondrial biogenesis in both age groups. A short‐term KD induced a robust increase in Tfam mRNA and an increase in SIRT1, SIRT3, and PGC‐1α protein, suggestive of mitochondrial biogenesis. By contrast, direct measurement of mitochondrial protein synthesis during the last two weeks of a four‐month KD showed that mitochondrial protein synthesis decreased.",55262b1c-02d0-45e1-a8d0-6c5abb4abc88
39,discussion6," Even with a decrease in mitochondrial protein synthesis, animals on a KD had higher citrate synthase activity, indicating either that a KD either increased mitochondrial biogenesis (and protein synthesis) at an earlier time point or that a KD increased one measure of mitochondrial activity independent of mass. The fact that of mitochondrial biogenesis (d e) oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein levels were not different between diets at 16 months argues that a short‐term KD increases mitochondrial activity. A long‐term KD also showed molecular signals consistent with mitochondrial biogenesis including increased Ppargc1a expression, the angiogenic factor Esrra, and the mitochondrial regulators Tfam and Tfb1 m. In the older mice on a KD, the increase in markers of mitochondrial biogenesis was matched with greater citrate synthase activity (a proxy for mitochondrial function) and higher levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation machinery (complexes I, III, IV, and V).",06b6133a-e119-48f1-aa87-a0792872b85e
40,discussion7," Together, these data suggest that a KD may increase mitochondrial activity in younger animals (shorter time on the diet) and mitochondrial mass and function in older animals. This improved mitochondrial function may contribute to the improved longevity on a KD . However, the direct contribution of greater mitochondrial function to muscle mass and strength with age remains to be determined.  3.4 Cellular stress response  One of the most striking findings of the current work was that the age‐associated increase in ER stress was completely attenuated by a KD. On the control diet, aging resulted in an increase in BiP, IRE1α, and PDI. This is consistent with our previous work in aging muscle . By contrast, each of these factors were lower in mice on a long‐term KD.",d906a210-2154-45e2-8a9d-865ce2889e7e
41,discussion8," Whereas the chaperones (BiP and PDI) of the adaptive ER stress response were lower on a KD, the protein synthesis regulator eIF2α was significantly more phosphorylated in response to both a short‐term and long‐term KD. In fact, the phosphorylation of eIF2α appears more predictive of the decrease in protein synthesis on a KD than other molecular regulators (e.g., mTORC1; see below). These data suggest that a KD decreases unfolded proteins resulting in a healthy cellular milieu.  Maintaining redox status is also particularly important for preserving cellular homeostasis. Increased production of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) and a reduction of antioxidant scavengers with aging are thought to contribute to dysfunction and exercise intolerance through genomic and proteomic oxidation . In this study, we see a decrease in SOD2 with age that is prevented by long‐term KD.",ab5dab47-4c59-462c-8530-a527687a45fe
42,discussion9," Similarly, catalase tends to decrease with age and increases with both short‐ and long‐term KD. An increase in antioxidants with a KD is consistent with the increase in mitochondrial activity, and presumably reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, with the increased reliance on fat as a fuel. Depletion of SOD2 and catalase is sufficient to induce muscle dysfunction and inhibit mitochondrial function in mice . Further, the loss of catalase has been implicated in muscle atrophy (Sullivan‐Gunn & Lewandowski, 2013). Therefore, the ability of a long‐term KD to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity, possibly in response to the increased electron transport necessary for fat oxidation, may protect muscle from oxidative stress during aging.",8b59a432-4d5a-44a5-9320-0dcb5bacfa75
43,discussion10," However, it is important to note that Picard and colleagues have shown that SOD and catalase activity increase the most in muscles that show the greatest decrease in muscle mass with age , suggesting that a simple relationship between increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and maintained muscle mass does not exist.  Age‐associated changes to the immune system and low‐grade chronic inflammation have been suggested to contribute to skeletal muscle loss with aging . In skeletal muscle, the NFκB pathway is a key transcriptional regulator of pro‐inflammatory factors, such as Il‐1β, which in turn is activated by the NOD‐like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome . With aging, the level of NFκB subunits (p50 and p65), Il‐1β transcription and the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome have previously been shown to increase in older skeletal muscle .",18939d1b-5b22-43b2-b9c5-d9fd2fdd3631
44,discussion11," We have previously shown that KD had no effect on the levels of plasma inflammatory markers (TNFα, CXCL1, and IL‐6) when compared to an isocaloric control diet . In the present study, we similarly show that aging had no effect on NFκB signaling (p50 and p65) or IL‐1β expression in skeletal muscle and this was not affected by diet. The fact that NFκB signaling and IL‐1β mRNA expression were not elevated with age suggests that keeping the animals weight‐neutral throughout the study may have prevented the typical rise in inflammation seen in aging animals. Consistent with this hypothesis, CR reduces inflammation in muscle (Lopez‐Lluch & Navas, 2016). Therefore, a KD may reduce inflammation in conditions where metabolic syndrome is present and inflammation is elevated, but this does not appear to be an important mechanism during healthy aging.  3.",f4728bf7-619a-421b-b7d6-771db39c2896
45,discussion12,"5 Proteostasis  Muscle protein synthesis rates were determined using deuterated water in mice over the last two weeks of a 4‐month KD. These data indicated that myofibrillar, mitochondrial, and cytoplasmic fractional synthesis rates were all decreased by a KD. We were unable to collect fractional synthesis rates for mice on the 16‐month KD or determine DNA synthesis rate at any time point. The decrease in fractional synthesis observed at 16 months matches that of other pro‐longevity models that inhibit growth signaling pathways to downregulate protein synthesis . Interestingly though, our data diverge from these growth‐restriction, pro‐longevity models as the KD increased IRS‐1 levels, which might imply greater potential for activation of mTORC1, while attenuating protein synthesis. As stated above, the decrease in protein synthesis on a KD best fits with the increase in eIF2α phosphorylation in response to both short‐ and long‐term KD.",9ee4f0bf-0a9f-474c-8b43-56e7ece14c16
46,discussion13," eIF2 phosphorylation inhibits protein synthesis by blocking the formation of the 43S preinitiation complex. Formation of the preinitiation complex requires guanine nucleotide exchange on eIF2. This process is facilitated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B  and is regulated in times of decreased nutritional supply and diabetes (Proud & Denton, 1997). Upon phosphorylation of the alpha subunit, eIF2 shifts from a substrate to an inhibitor of eIF2B (Kimball, 1999). Binding of phosphorylated eIF2α to eIF2B sequesters eIF2B in inactive complexes. Since eIF2 outnumbers eIF2B by 10 to 1, this quickly inhibits GTP exchange and therefore the initiation of protein synthesis . A decrease in translation initiation may slow protein synthesis and increase the fidelity of translation, preventing protein misfolding and decreasing ER stress. Further, since translational fidelity is inversely related to longevity (Ke et al.",4c687b22-3338-4a15-a8ce-38a4ad051656
47,discussion14,", 2017), a decrease in translational initiation could contribute to the increase in longevity observed on a KD .  In addition to reduced protein synthesis, proteasomal degradation was marginally attenuated by a long‐term KD. Mean proteasomal degradation was greater at 26 than 16 months of age. The increase in activity with age is contrary to what is seen between 6 and 24 months of age in rats, where proteasome activity decreases in skeletal muscle . Similarly, Selsby and colleagues and Radak et al found that proteasome activity decreased between 10 and 28–30 months in Fisher 344 rats . These findings are in contrast to what has been observed in Fischer 344 X Brown Norway F1‐hybrid animals where proteosome activity increases between 8 and 30–40 months .",c3644a8a-5bc7-491b-bbd8-acad3e467cc2
48,discussion15," These discrepancies may be the result of genetic differences between the strains or that proteasome activity starts high in younger animals where muscle growth rate is higher , decreases to a nadir between 16 and 18 months and then begins to increase from there. The increase we observed from 16 to 26 months tended to be lower with the KD, specifically for 20 s β5 and 26 β5 activity. This is similar to what has been observed with caloric restriction . For autophagy, aging appeared to have a more dramatic effect than the KD. The LC3B II:I ratio decreased dramatically between 16 and 26 months, suggestive of a decrease in autophagy with aging. This is consistent with previous work on autophagy in aging mouse muscle . Activators of autophagy have been shown to improve muscle function with age; however, a long‐term KD did not affect autophagy.",09dbeb0b-85c9-4070-9b70-501b004e47fe
49,discussion16," The only atrophy‐associated proteins that were responsive to the KD were FOXO1 and FOXO3a. FOXO1 was significantly higher in KD than control (CON) mice at 26 months old, whereas FOXO3a was significantly elevated by short‐term KD, nearly mimicking the heightened FOXO3a levels at 26 months old in both control (CON) and KD mice compared to young controls. Overall, the marginal decrease in protein degradation is probably the result of a healthier cellular environment (less oxidative and ER stress) decreasing the need for turnover. This hypothesis is further supported by the reduced protein synthesis rates observed in the KD mice. Given the marginal effect on degradation, it is unlikely that degradation is responsible for the increase in muscle mass and function on a KD.  4 control (CON)CLUSION  Overall, this study shows the effectiveness of a long‐term ketogenic diet in mitigating sarcopenia.",e156ebf9-fd9f-4f5c-a38a-db818f0d7cec
50,discussion17," As summarized in Figure 6, a ketogenic diet increased mitochondrial and antioxidant proteins possibly leading to the preferential preservation of oxidative muscle fibers. The increase in fiber grouping in old animals on a ketogenic diet suggests that axonal sprouting and reinnervation may have increased helping to maintain muscle mass. In both young and old animals, we observed an increase in the phosphorylation of eIF2α that would slow translation initiation and may result in improved translational fidelity and a healthier cellular environment wherein mice on a KD would require less protein turnover, measured as reduced protein synthesis, proteasomal degradation, and ER stress. Together, these shifts would allow mice to maintain a greater muscle mass as they age. However, it is also plausible that the benefits observed in muscle mass and function may be secondary to changes in other tissues, since a long‐term KD is an organismal rather than tissue‐level intervention.",25e0dde6-101c-4918-88e7-b1a918e3fcfa
51,discussion18,"  FIGURE 6 Potential mechanism of the effect of the ketogenic diet (KD) on muscle preservation with aging.
