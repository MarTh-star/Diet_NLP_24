0,methods0," Animal treatment in pregnancy and postpartum  In the experiment, we used 30 2-month-old female Wistar rats obtained from the animal colony in the Laboratory of Experimental Neuropathology (Institute of Zoology and Biomedical Research, Jagiellonian University, Krakow). All procedures were carried out in accordance with the permission no. 122/2015 of the First Local Ethical Committee. Before the experiment, all the animals were fed with a normal diet (ND) for rodents (Morawski Labofeed H Standard).  To control fertilization, female rats were placed in one cage with males for 8 h during the night. In the morning, every sperm-positive female was placed in a separate cage for the period of pregnancy.  On the day of sperm positivity (gestational day 0, G0), the pregnant females were randomly divided into two groups. The first group (NDs, n = 13) remained on the normal diet while the ketogenic diet (KD, ssnif® EF R/M with 80% Fat, www.ssniff.",297b53eb-163d-4ac8-9e87-64eb14226929

Table 1 shows the content of ketogenic and normal diets.Fig. 1 The scheme of dietary treatments of females during pregnancy and lactation periods with their numbers (n) in successively selected groups. Maternal blood parameters, body mass and food intake were measured on the day of fertilization (G0), on gestational days 4, 15, 20 and on the second day postpartum (PP2). On PP2, in six previously KD-fed females, the normal diet was introduced. In addition, on PP2, six ND- and six KD-fed females were subjected to perfusion-fixation and their brain processed for Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Neurodevelopmental reflex tests on pups were performed during the lactation period, i.e., up till day 21 postpartum (PP21).

3,methods3,"  According to the Reduction Principle of 3R Rule, 2 days postpartum (PP2), 12 females, previously examined for glucose and BHB blood levels, assigned for Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR)) measurements, were weighed and perfused with physiological saline of high analytical purity. Their brains were immediately excised from the skulls, weighed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pups of the perfused females were included in recordings of the litter size, sexual proportion and body mass on P2.  Remaining females were kept with their pups up till they were weaned on day 21 after delivery (P21). Among them, seven females from NDs and five from KDs were continuously fed with the same, respective diets. However, on PP2, in six initially KD-fed females, the diet was replaced with the normal one and continued up till the weaning time. This dietary treatment is indicated here as KDND and the animal group fed in this way as KDNDs.",371eee77-313d-445d-b386-a119c5860bd6

Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR) microscopy, biochemical and principal component analysis (PCA) analysis  For the topographic biochemical analysis of the whole brain slices and the hippocampal formation areas, Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR)) was applied. The measurements were carried out in the Department of Medical Physics and Biophysics (Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow) using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR) microscope Nicolet iN10 MX (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The tissue samples placed on the glasses made of CaF2 were examined in the transmission mode.

5,methods5," They were measured for the wavenumber range of 900–4000 cm−1 with the resolution of 8 cm−1 accumulating 32 scans per each single spectrum. The spatial resolution of the measurements was around 25 μm in both directions.  The data acquisition and the topographic analysis were performed using OMNIC Picta software (version 1.5.141). To determine the distributions of compounds containing carbonyl groups (including ketone bodies), chemical maps for the band at the wavenumber of 1740 cm−1 were used. In turn, spectral region 1360–1480 cm−1, characteristic for bending vibrations of methyl and methylene groups was applied for imaging the distribution of lipids, cholesterol and/or its esters (Chwiej et al. 2015; Drozdz et al. 2020).

6,methods6," For calculations of the integrated band areas, the trapezoidal baseline correction was used and the background was taken at the two extreme frequency values of the peak/massif.  To quantitatively compare the intensity of the examined absorption bands (1740 cm−1 and 1360–1480 cm−1) between the ketogenic- and normal diet-fed rats, for each animal their average intensities were calculated within the cortex, white matter and four main cellular layers of the hippocampal formation, namely granular, pyramidal, multiform and molecular layers (Fig. 2). To extract the pixels belonging to the particular brain areas or cellular layers, the chemical maps were imposed on the microscopic pictures obtained for each examined sample (Fig. 2c). The pixels belonging to the examined brain areas were chosen with avoiding the points localized in the border of the layers (Fig. 2d).",5b4098d8-7cf4-4722-ad1c-039a101a5125

For the complete rotation occurring within 15 s, the rat was given 2 points but 1 point when the rotation was incomplete. The test was repeated until 2 points were received in two consecutive days.  From P4, more neurodevelopmental tests were applied, such as:  Hind limb placing—the rat was held upright and the upper side of the paw was rubbed against the edge of a cliff. The correct result was when the paw bended in response and a point was received for each hind paw. The test was considered passed when 2 points were received in two consecutive days.  Cliff avoidance—a pup was placed on the cliff edge and observed during 15 s. If it moved away but its paws remained on the edge, 1 point was given. If the pup moved away completely, 2 points were given. The result was negative when the pup did not move or fall from the cliff edge.",452d1d82-867e-4653-ac9b-3186ebeced69
12,methods12," The test was scored when two points were obtained within two subsequent days. A necessary assistance prevented the pups from injurious falls.  On P6, the gait test was added in which a rat placed in the center of a 15 cm diameter paper disc was expected to leave it within 30 s. The test was successfully completed when, in two consecutive days, the rat was able to cross the disc rim with, at least, both forepaws. Each rat was protected from cooling with a thick layer of polystyrene placed under the disc.  On P10, the auditory startle reflex test was introduced, where a rat, isolated from other animals, was exposed to a sharp auditory stimulus from above its head to evoke flexing its body in response. The test was passed positively when the response was repeated on two consecutive days.  From P12, eye opening was monitored to record the day when both eyes were fully open.  From P13, the rat posture during movement was observed.",5163f1e6-568c-405b-807e-01127fe5df23
13,methods13," The rat ability to keep its abdomen above the ground with vertically oriented limbs during movements was scored positively.  Finally, the accelerated righting test was introduced on P14. Rats were tested for the ability to body rotation after they were kept upside down then dropped 30 cm above the ground. When the juvenile rats made a half turn and fell on its side, 1 point was given. The rats received 2 points when they fell on their four paws. No point was given after falling on the dorsal side. A soft floor was used in the test to protect animals from damages. A heating lamp helped to reduce the risk of hypothermia of the pups.

30,discussion0," Drug-resistant epilepsies constitute almost 30% of all epileptic cases. However, even when pharmacotherapy can be used effectively, its harmful side effects frequently exclude its application in pregnant women (Tomson 2019) and the only alternative can to be the use of a ketogenic diet. Most of the clinical research on this topic focuses on monitoring women’s health and the course of the disease. Our experiment was the first published attempt at a long-term assessment of the physiological condition of offsprings to female who were on a ketogenic diet during pregnancy. In experimental conditions, we could study the effect of the diet used, without taking into account accompanying changes caused by the development of the disease or previously used therapies. Such conditions also allowed, to a greater extent, to focus on the assessment of developmental parameters.",54c5ecae-40aa-49a3-a82f-d7d45193e4f1
31,discussion1,"  For the first time, our research presents a detailed description of the course of pregnancy in KD-fed rat females from the very beginning of pregnancy to the end of lactation period. It became clear that, despite the intake of high-calorie food, in which as much as 80% of energy comes from fat, their average body mass at any of the four time points of pregnancy (up till G20) was not greater than that of the ND-fed females. However, the level of BHB in their peripheral blood was significantly higher from G4 and increased up till postnatal day 21, when it reached the level of 7 mmol/l. According to the literature data (Herrera et al. 1987), ketone bodies circulating in the maternal blood easily cross the placenta. Under the conditions of a normal diet, the fetal development depends on a continuous supply of glucose and appropriate amino acids. Any insufficiency in this supply affects the metabolism in both the mother and the fetus (Barry 2018).",0a7557db-6e0f-4f1a-b5a6-a67720b69910
32,discussion2,"  Our research showed that the glucose level in KD-fed females was lowered only at the last measurement point (G20), i.e., about two days before delivery, so there should rather not lead to any important disturbances. As it is known, long-term ketonemia during pregnancy can evoke metabolic encephalopathies (Al-Mudallal et al. 1995). Sussman (2013) showed that in the early stages of pregnancy, KD intensifies the heart growth (at E13.5) and reduces the growth of the pharynx, cervical spine, pons, midbrain and hypothalamus. On E17.5, she observed a reduction of the heart and thymus, and an enlargement of the cervical spine, pons, midbrain and thalamus. This discrepancies in organ growth may be due to variations in the availability of metabolic “fuel”. As revealed by Lust et al. (2003), on the 18th day of gestation in ND-fed females, a significant increase in BHB content was found in the fetal brains.",5e6de411-073b-4a91-b9ff-e063f5bb89c5
33,discussion3,"  Our observations showed that KD does not affect the duration of pregnancy, and all the females, regardless of the type of diet applied, gave birth 21–22 days after conception. The number of pups in the litter also did not differ between the animal groups, and there were no changes in proportions of male and female pups. This is likely due to the fact that all pregnant females were still on ND at the time of conception. However, on P2, a significantly reduced body mass was observed in animals born by females treated with KD during their pregnancy. This difference persisted on postnatal days 6. Similar results were obtained by Mark et al. (2011) and Mendes-da-Silva et al. (2014) using a high-fat diet in pregnant females, and Soares et al. (2009) using two KD types with different fat contents. Despite the considerably lowered body mass, we did not observe any morphological anomalies in the pups born by females kept on KD during pregnancy.",1d9bc27d-1848-4f60-b489-5d89f3c8f0f3
34,discussion4," This early reduction in the body mass was compensated relatively quickly following, as evidenced on P14 by disappearance of differences between offsprings of KDND- and ND-fed females which is the effect of KD replacement with ND. On the contrary, a continuous application of KD resulted in a constant reduction of the body mass during the whole examined period, i.e., up to the weaning time (P21). However, this is only an indicator of compensation in terms of general somatic development, which does not have to correspond with an improvement in the functional neurological state which depends on disorders of the much more restrictive calendar of brain development.  In the present investigation, Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR) microspectroscopy was used to verify if ketogenic diet feeding of pregnant females leads to biochemical changes within their brains. Before, we have already performed a similar study (Chwiej et al.",e406fc50-6236-42cc-ac20-075a1ac0587d
35,discussion5," 2015), but only on 30-day-old males who were treated with KD for next 30 days. So far, such studies have not been performed on females. The topographic analysis of chemical maps presenting the distribution of 1740 cm−1 and 1360–1480 cm−1 bands specific for compounds containing carbonyl groups, lipids, cholesterol and/or its esters showed significantly increased surface of the white matter characterized by the elevated intensities of these bands. Further quantitative and statistical analysis of the obtained results did not point, however, that the accumulations of the mentioned compounds was changed within the examined brain areas and cellular layers in KD-fed females. Thus, the changes such as increased levels of lipids and carbonyl groups containing compounds observed previously in males where not confirmed in this study in females.",cd6816ca-1a72-46ea-b138-f046aaff7d1e
36,discussion6," This result is quite surprising considering that there are studies, which proved that ketone bodies easily passed through the BBB and could accumulate within the brain parenchyma and their increased availability implied a subsequent increase of the lipid synthesis (Barry 2018). In addition, the results of principal component analysis (PCA) did not show any general differences between the spectra recorded for females fed with ketogenic and normal diet in particular layers of the hippocampal formation, neocortex and white matter.  To assess how KD, low in proteins and sugars, applied in pregnant females, would affect the postnatal development of their offsprings, a series of neurodevelopmental reflexes was performed in three groups of animals whose mothers (i) were fed KD during pregnancy and lactation (KDs), (ii) were fed KD only during pregnancy and ND from the second postpartum day (KDNDs), and (iii) were fed exclusively with ND (NDs).",acd0a6c1-5568-4112-aa91-35fbbfa06159
37,discussion7," The tests assessed some general parameters of physiological development (like eye opening and posture), reflexes (forelimb and hindlimb grasping, hindlimb placing), body rotation and auditory startle. The tests were successively introduced from P3, when it was not yet possible to observe more complex behavioral parameters. These tests, just like in human newborns, could predict developmental disorders of various origins, such as, for example, cerebral palsy (Nguyen et al. 2017).  All the neurological tests were performed separately on males and females, but the hindlimb grasping and righting tests were the only two of them which detected intersexual differences. The righting test in male pups born by ND-treated females was performed significantly earlier than in their female counterparts originating from KD-treated females. Similarly, the male pups of KDND-fed females were better in the hindlimb grasping tests.",51bca0ad-8fcb-4704-a45e-abf68a0c717d
38,discussion8," No gender-dependent differences were observed in any other test, regardless of the type of food consumed during pregnancy. It appears, therefore, reasonable that until puberty (at about P21), differences between behaviors of males and females may not be expected. Similar conclusions were presented by Sussman et al. (2015).  Interestingly, two important physiological symptoms of maturity, i.e., opening the eyes and maintaining a proper posture, were first observed in the offspring of KDND-fed females, compared to those from females which were always on ND. Similar results were observed by Nguyen (2017), in pups whose mothers received broccoli extract during pregnancy and had induced inflammation. Studies on rodents show that eye opening is correlated with changes in the GABAA receptor subunit in the visual cortex (Heinen et al. 2004). Thus, earlier eyes opening may indicate an intensification of plastic processes in the cortex supposedly evoked by the dietary changes.",442fa5b3-8805-4119-913c-9f20502cb8f5
39,discussion9,"  In most of the performed tests (except for hindlimb placing), the maintenance of KD throughout pregnancy, as well as during the period including both pregnancy and lactation, delayed the performance of the tests in respective offsprings as compared to the progeny ND-nourished females. The most developmentally delayed was the performance of the neurological tests in animals whose mothers were fed KD not only during pregnancy, but also during lactation. In ND-fed animals, the energy from the lactate metabolism transformation is obtained only shortly after birth. Then, until the end of lactation period, the ketone bodies are the source of energy for the pups (Prins 2012), because during the neonatal period their brains are not able to efficiently use glucose as a metabolic substrate (Nehlig 1999). During this time, not only does the amount of ketones in the body increase, but also the number and activity of their transporters in the blood–brain barrier (Vannucci and Simpson 2003).",2a5ca9dd-3f83-4956-bf37-8fd7abb1dc9d
40,discussion10,"  This is why the immature rat brain is able to take up and accumulate ketone bodies faster and more efficiently than the mature one (Nehlig 1999). During the period of peak ketone utilization, the brain ability to uptake ß-hydroxybutyrate (ßOHB) is sixfold greater than that in adulthood (Cremer et al. 1976). Therefore, if the lactating females are additionally fed with KD, these changes may be intensified and lead to metabolic acidosis (Sussman 2013), which reduces lactation and thus inhibits the developmental progress of the pups. This results, apart from body mass reduction, in definitely delayed muscle development and developmental brain disorders leading to worse performance of neurodevelopmental reflexes.  The prenatal period is critical to the development of the nervous system (Rice and Barone 2000) and, apart from stress or inflammation, it can be affected by malnutrition (Cusik and Georfieff 2016).",0525faa8-5550-47fc-9149-93bd6c9e824c
41,discussion11," The continuity of prenatal and postnatal development should also be taken into account. Thus, effects of prenatal malnutrition would occur also in brain structures that develop postnatally (Morgane et al. 2002). Following KD consumption during pregnancy, as much as 80% of energy derives from metabolized fats and as much as 70% less protein is provided than in the case of ND. Protein deficiency in the diet of pregnant females, as described by Abey (2019), delayed neurological and postural reflexes. The results of our tests confirm this observation in the offsprings of females receiving KD only during pregnancy or during both pregnancy and lactation. We also observed depleted hair in the offspring of females who were fed with KD while being pregnant and lactating. This could be due to inadequate development of the hair follicles (Guo and Katta 2017) resulting from protein deficiency.",0afee980-6abc-48ca-b0e2-3e316ad1c701
42,discussion12," Another reason for the delays in the tests of neurodevelopmental reflexes shown by the offspring of KD-fed females might be a reduction of forebrain vascularization in animals on a protein-deficient diet (Bennis-Taleb et al. 1999) which can be preserved up till adulthood.  During pregnancy, the protein-poor diet may also decrease expression of brain neurotrophins in the rat offspring including that of BDNF which, in turn, affects neuro- or synaptogenesis (Marwarha et al. 2017) resulting in worse performance of neurodevelopmental tests.  The results of seven from of the ten neurological tests applied in the present study clearly indicate that the ketogenic diet withdrawal may lead not only to a general, unspecific restitution of somatic condition, represented here by the compensatory regain of reduced body mass, but may also result in functional restitution of the nervous system, although not to the full extent.",5ec3bd84-3ce8-42f5-b894-97dd4bf417fc
43,discussion13," However, our study has considered developmental period up to the weaning time, so a further progress in the functional amelioration up till the complete adulthood cannot be excluded. Thus, the first and most important task for further research in this field is to detect, if not the specific mechanisms underlying these changes, then at least their structural correlates.  Conclusions  Taking into account the presented results, one should consider the rationale of KD application in pregnant women suffering from epilepsy. All over the world, antiepileptic drug therapies include as many as 15 million women in their reproductive age and bring the risk of serious birth defects and adverse effects on the neurocognitive and behavioral development of newborn babies. However, uncontrolled seizures can also be harmful not only to the pregnant woman but also to the fetus (Tomson 2019). Therefore, other measures to prevent seizures during pregnancy, including KD, are often considered.",f845ed52-401a-433a-a330-b1af3addedf3
44,discussion14," However, case reports are related rather to the efficacy of dietary regimen in suppressing seizures in pregnant women but not on its effects on their babies. Seizure amelioration occurs and is accompanied by increases in blood lipids, which, however, return to the norm after delivery. Children of these mothers are born at term with a reduced body mass (van der Louw et al. 2016), but their further fate has not been studied. Rizzo et al. (1995) monitored infants whose pregnant mothers suffering from diabetes had highly increased levels of ketones. The results of motor skills tests of these children were inversely related to the maternal β-hydroxybutyric acid content in blood during pregnancy, and their IQ was inversely correlated with the maternal blood ketone content.  Considering the above-mentioned results, we intend to continue our research on older, 30- and 60-day-old rats born to females fed KD during pregnancy.",bebc2ec4-f761-4117-95bb-9c8418647b49
45,discussion15," We are going to assess whether the neonatal changes observed in the present study will be worsen or compensated during further development. In addition to behavioral and histological studies, we would also like to focus on changes in the molecular composition of the nervous tissue. Such an interdisciplinary approach will improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying the already documented action of the ketogenic diet.
