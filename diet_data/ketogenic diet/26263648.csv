0,introduction0,"Octanoic acid, and decanoic acid, 8-carbon and 10-carbon medium chain fatty acids (medium chain fatty acids (MCFA)), respectively, are found as medium chain triglycerides (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)) in foods such as coconut oil and goat milk. Unlike longer chain fatty acids such as palmitic acid, medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are able to quickly enter the bloodstream and exist as free fatty acids which freely pass through cell membranes. Upon entry into the portal vein medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are converted into ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetate and acetoacetate), which can be taken up into the brain via medium chain triglycerides (MCT)1 transporters [1]. Ketones act as substrates for production of acetyl-CoA, thus they can serve as alternative energy sources when glucose is low [2]. This glycolysis bypass property of ketones is especially important for neurons, which use glucose or ketones as primary energy sources for production of ATP.",a46deb7c-82b5-4147-abcc-4817df42dfe3
1,introduction1," Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients have been shown to exhibit decreases in brain glucose metabolism and glycolytic enzymes, thus ketones may be useful as an adjuvant fuel [3]. Recent research has shown that ketones derived from medium chain fatty acids improve cognition in diabetic and AD patients, and attenuate neurodegeneration in an ALS mouse model [4].  Although a majority of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) ingested are converted into ketones, ADME studies have shown that medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) themselves can enter the brain and have diverse effects on neuronal function [5,6]. For example, medium chain fatty acids activate free fatty acids sensing G-protein coupled receptors such as GPR40 and GPR84, which are highly expressed in the brain and have roles in glucose regulation and inflammation [7]. Recently medium chain fatty acids have been shown to modulate mitochondrial enzyme function in a neuroblastoma cell line [8].",2a81e83a-0f76-484c-a31c-9aa662191f06
2,introduction2," Specifically a 6-day administration of decanoic acid increased citrate synthase, Complex I and catalase activity while octanoic acid had no effect. Interestingly, decanoic acid has been shown to be a ligand for PPAR gamma receptors, while octanoic acid has no activity [9]. Meanwhile, octanoic acid has been almost exclusively used to in human and animal studies assessing cognition, due to its purported superior ketogenic potential.  It is unknown if decanoic acid triglyceride (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10) also has effects on cognition, since no published studies have assessed medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10 for effects on age-related cognitive decline. Moreover, it is currently unknown if medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) such as octanoic acid or decanoic acid, which are released after medium chain triglycerides (MCT) consumption, have differential effects on metabolic function of neuronal cells in vivo.",c7cc784d-a7ac-49fb-a516-403e34191a58

4,methods0,"Animals, treatment, measurement of ketones and medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) All animal care and procedures were approved by the Nestle Institutional Ethic Committee for Animal Care and the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO)). Rats were deeply anesthetized via isoflurane, and decapitated. Thirty-six male Wistar rats, 21 months of age, were ordered from Janvier Labs (France) and acclimated for 7 days to the facility. During this time, they were kept in pair-housed cages. After the acclimatization period, they were randomized into three groups of 12 animals according to cognition and body weight. Baseline cognition was tested via social recognition (procedure described below). Rats were single-housed in standard cages with free access to food and water, and were kept at a 12 hour light cycle period, at a temperature between 20–24°C, and a relative humidity between 50–60%.",279d4dd3-5442-446c-9ff0-2df71213d864
5,methods1," Rats were given a diet of 5% medium chain triglycerides: octanoic triglyceride (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)8), decanoic triglyceride (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10) or control diet (5% sunflower oil) via specially formulated animal chow for 8 weeks. Sunflower oil was added to the control diet in order to maintain an equivalent calorie and lipid content to that of the medium chain triglycerides (MCT)-supplemented diets. Rats were weighed every week to ensure weight maintenance. Plasma was collected at sacrifice via heparinized tubes, and was analyzed for ketones via colorimetric kits (Cayman) and medium chain fatty acids, octanoic and decanoic acid, were analysed via GC/MS [10]. Brains were extracted and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Analysis of brain tissue concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate (brain tissue concentrations of beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB)) were performed by GC/MS (see Scherer).",1c2eff04-18d4-4e73-b9c4-95ec9fc6778a
6,methods2," Samples were prepared via liquid/liquid extraction of 50 μl supernatant (pH 2), and extract derivatization with MSTFA (silylation). GC/MS analysis was performed using an internal standard 13C2-brain tissue concentrations of beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB), m/z 233 (brain tissue concentrations of beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB)), m/z 118 (13C2-brain tissue concentrations of beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB)) using a calibration of 2–24 μg/ml (water); LOQ: 2 μg/ml, LOD: 0.7 μg/ml.  Behavior testing Social recognition Rats were tested for behavioral effects of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) via a social interaction test 3 days before sacrifice. This test involves the introduction of an unfamiliar juvenile rat into the home-cage of the test rat for 4 minutes. The amount of touching, sniffing and general exploration of the juvenile rat was recorded, and the total time period of social interaction were used as indicators of sociality and anxiety.",02417888-3afc-4db4-89b2-88b3408773e6
7,methods3," After 1 hr the previously explored juvenile and a new juvenile were introduced into the home cage for 4 minutes. If a rat failed explore the juvenile for more than 30 seconds during the first session it was not included in the final analysis. Social recognition was calculated by the amount of time spent exploring the new juvenile over the total amount of time spent exploring both juveniles (JNEW/(JNEW+JOLD)).  Open field and object recognition The novel object recognition test provides both a measure of anxiety, locomotion (open field), and exploratory behavior (novel object). Animals were placed in the intermediate zone of a square open field (100X100 cm2) with a low-level lighting to avoid inducing state anxiety (25 Lux) and allowed to freely explore the arena for 5 minutes. In this test, the distance traveled is a valid measure of natural locomotor activity. The time spent in the center of the arena in the first 5 minutes is a measure of anxiety.",996929c6-bbe8-4688-bdd0-759c1fe5f475
8,methods4," During this time, the animal’s behavior was recorded and automatically tracked using Ethovision tracking software, and after each session the arena is cleaned with 70% ethanol. The following day, two identical objects (small, colored cylindrical or rectangular shapes) were placed in the center of the arena and the animal was allowed to explore the objects for 10 minutes or until the total duration of object exploration is 30 seconds. If a rat failed to explore the objects for at least 30 seconds it was not included in the final analysis. After 1.5 hr the rat was placed in the field with the previous object and a new object for 5 min. The amount of time spent in the center with the objects present during the first session is a valid measure of exploratory activity and the amount of time spent exploring the novel object vs. total time exploring both objects in the second session is an indicator of memory ability.",8db90203-05fb-4a97-ab95-aed9d140211d

26,discussion0,"Medium chain triglycerides are currently prescribed for mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, and one clinical study has shown that medium chain triglycerides (MCT)8 improves memory in APOE4-negative patients [20]. Several studies have demonstrated glucose hypometabolism in AD brains, and AD subjects with low cerebral metabolic use of glucose appear to compensate via higher brain ketone metabolism than age-matched controls [21,22]. While medium chain triglycerides (MCT)-derived ketones are undoubtedly impacting brain metabolism, less is known about the individual effects of medium chain triglycerides (MCT)-derived medium chain fatty acids (MCFA), octanoic acid and decanoic acid, which are readily available to the brain [5,23].  Both medium chain triglycerides (MCT) diets were accepted by the rats, and although all the groups ate the same amount of chow, the medium chain triglycerides (MCT) groups maintained weight while the sunflower oil group gained weight.",1ca01bea-bc7d-4c3f-8e61-e8e62b8b988f
27,discussion1," This weight loss effect was likely due to immediate metabolism of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) into ketones, which were then used as energy substrates in muscles and organs. Plasma ketones displayed a tendency of higher levels in medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10 rats compared to medium chain triglycerides (MCT)8 rats, but this was not significant. Previous medium chain triglycerides (MCT) pharmacokinetic studies reported higher levels of ketones 3–6 hr after medium chain triglycerides (MCT)8 gavage than medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10, where medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10 appeared to have a lower rate of metabolism into ketones. Our results do not support these findings, which only examined short term treatment [24,25].",c5b496f6-cf5e-4550-94b0-daab5903aa8f
28,discussion2," However, in studies with humans demonstrate that prolonged feeding of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) gradually increases plasma ketones over several weeks, suggesting that the rate of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) metabolism from medium chain triglycerides (MCT) is saturated with chronic feeding [26].  Cognition has been shown to improve after octanoic triglyceride diet in aged humans and animals [2,27,28], yet no studies have compared specific species of medium chain triglycerides (MCT)s in terms of cognition. The social recognition test measures olfactory episodic memory, involving the cortex and hippocampus [29]. This test robustly measures olfactory memory consolidation of juveniles and is highly sensitive to aging and nutritional interventions [18,30]. Control rats in the current study performed slightly above chance at baseline and after 8 weeks average ratios of recognition remained at chance level, indicating no recognition of familiar vs unfamiliar juveniles after 2 hours.",94d8b919-0149-4e35-87a0-5dd9ef630bd7
29,discussion3," medium chain triglycerides (MCT)8 and medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10 treated rats’ memory performance improved from baseline and, although there was no statistical difference between the two medium chain triglycerides (MCT) treatments, medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10 rats had greater trajectories of recognition indices in the social recognition test. In the novel object recognition test, medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10 rats performed significantly better than control rats while medium chain triglycerides (MCT)8 rats did not. Moreover, compared to control rats, medium chain triglycerides (MCT)8 rats displayed less locomotor activity in an open field test, and had greater latency to explore an object placed in an open field, indicating lower motivation and novelty-induced exploration. medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10 rats did not differ from control rats in these behavioral indicators.",8e8c5298-1ef1-4f72-ad4e-ab7e1a7ca0ba
30,discussion4," Taken together these results indicate a possible difference in behavioral effects due to medium chain triglycerides (MCT) species, however, these results must be replicated and extended with tests assessing additional cognitive indices.  Synapse formation and maintenance in the hippocampus and cortex have long been associated with better cognition; thus two synaptic markers, PSD-95 and synaptophysin, were examined. While PSD-95, a post-synaptic marker, showed no difference between the groups, synaptophysin, located in pre-synaptic boutons, was increased in the medium chain triglycerides (MCT)8 group compared to the control group. Interestingly, growth factors important for synaptic plasticity, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and IGF-1, were unchanged compared to controls.",56270195-150e-4ab7-aeab-1428743e8efa
31,discussion5," The IRS-1/Akt pathway has been shown to regulate neuronal growth via mTOR and p70S6K and in fact may direct neuronal fate towards apoptosis or growth, depending on intrinsic factors [31]. IRS-1 phosphorylation was increased by medium chain triglycerides (MCT)8 diet while Akt phosphorylation was increased only in medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10 rats, indicating differential activities related to medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) carbon number. However, phosphorylation of p70S6K, a key regulator of protein synthesis and plasticity downstream of IRS-1 and Akt [32], was down-regulated by both medium chain triglycerides (MCT) diets.  These findings suggest that, while octanoic and decanoic acid may activate IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways to differential degrees, the net effect on protein synthesis regulation via S6K is similar. This may be due to direct effects of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) on neuronal receptors.",c5a5e113-4dcd-4601-8f59-88df9fdd2169
32,discussion6," For example, decanoic acid activates PPAR-γ receptors while octanoic acid metabolites, 2- and 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid, are HCA3 (GPR109B) agonists [9,33]. Interventions with PPAR-γ agonists such as rosiglitazone or pioglitazone have been shown to prevent apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction via increased neuronal Akt/PKB phosphorylation [34,35]. The mTORC1 complex is the major downstream target of Akt, and mTORC1 drives S6K phosphorylation, leading to subsequent protein translation and cell growth [36]. medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10 increased Akt phosphorylation but unexpectedly decreased S6K phosphorylation, which suggests that other pathways are inhibiting S6K phosphorylation. Conversely, while medium chain triglycerides (MCT)8 diet had no effect on Akt phosphorylation, S6K phosphorylation was decreased to the same extent as medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10 diet.",5820caec-f13e-418d-b1c9-ce2ffa126bf1
33,discussion7," Ketogenesis has been shown to downregulate mTOR and S6K (13) and so it may be possible that S6K inhibition is due to raised ketones while Akt phosphorylation was due to medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10-mediated PPAR-γ activity. Lastly, Ube3a, a key regulator of synaptic protein autophagy, was increased by both medium chain triglycerides (MCT) diets. Ube3a, a binding component of the ubiquitin/proteasomal complex, has roles in transcription factor degradation and synaptic stabilization [37]. Decreased Ube3a expression, via genetic or pharmacological manipulation, causes cognitive dysfunction via loss of synapses [38], and thus medium chain triglycerides (MCT) consumption may be enhancing cognition via synaptic maintenance.  Genes important for synaptic activity were also measured via RT-PCR in the prefrontal cortices of treated rats.",7e1277f8-b341-4479-9950-70a0bb18cae9
34,discussion8," Interestingly, a majority of IEGs essential for long term potentiation and memory consolidation were decreased in medium chain triglycerides (MCT) treated rats, including arc, egr1, egr2, nr4a1, fosb, plk3 and junb. Arc generally measures how well a memory has been consolidated when it is quantified directly after a cognition test [37]. However, high basal Arc may indicate spontaneous activity of cells unrelated to specific memory formation (36). Basal Arc is upregulated in aged rats with poor memory while aged rats with unimpaired memory show similar low Arc expression to young rats [39]. Thus Arc is controlled homeostatically, i.e. induced during memory entrainment and then efficiently turned off to maintain the memory.",9ea79196-f758-4169-8d83-dcaf2e694cdd
35,discussion9," Interestingly, Fletcher and colleagues showed that aged-impaired rats exhibited decreased hippocampal Ube3a protein expression and decreased expression correlated to higher Arc levels, suggesting that loss of Ube3a expression during aging may be contributing to constitutively active Arc, and thus poorer cognition.  Egr1 (NGFI-A), Egr2, FosB, and JunB belong to an early response family of transcription factors, where Egr1 is the most well-known for its role in synaptic plasticity, including regulation of Arc [40]. The above remaining transcription factors mediate synaptic renovation following long term potentiation (long term potentiation (LTP)) and are also tightly controlled. Accordingly, over-activation and chronic expression of plasticity-related IEG such as Egr1 indicates disrupted long term potentiation (LTP) mechanisms [41]. Junb, Nr4a1 (Nurr77) and Fosb, when transcribed directly after a memory task, are correlated with more efficient synaptic plasticity via LTD [42].",5f5b893a-ff8e-47cb-b671-4c636a87ce64
36,discussion10," However, less is known about basal transcription of such genes during aging. Similar to the discussion above, inappropriate transcription of junb or nr4a1 may indicate dysregulated control of synaptic growth. Tightly controlled synaptic synthesis and autophagy of these transcription factors are necessary for memory consolidation and maintenance of memory [43]. Indeed, human and animal studies have shown that brain regions with higher rates of synaptic turnover are more vulnerable to amyloid plaque build-up and degeneration [44–46].  Conclusion This study compared the cognitive and physiological effects of two medium chain triglyceride diets in aged rats, with the aim of assessing differential effects. Both medium chain triglycerides (MCT) diets improved cognitive performance and while the medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10 diet tended to improve social recognition compared to the medium chain triglycerides (MCT)8 diet, the effect did not reach significance.",5ae20e8a-4e01-4595-9bc4-e90ef86f4d26
37,discussion11," Slight differences were found between the two diets in terms of markers of synaptic, metabolic and transcriptional activity. medium chain triglycerides (MCT)8 diet showed a tendency toward stronger modulation of specific transcription factors and synaptic markers than medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10 diet, while medium chain triglycerides (MCT)10 diet enhanced Akt phosphorylation compared to controls. However, further studies are required to ascertain if these putative effects indicate specific medium chain triglycerides (MCT) species for cognitive decline treatment.
