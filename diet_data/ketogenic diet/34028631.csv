1,methods2,"  Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Culture and Stimulation  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)) from patients with verified COVID-19 infection were purified by density centrifugation (Histopaque 1077, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). A ViCell analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, United States) was used to determine cell count and viability. Cultivation of Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was performed in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) at a glucose concentration of 80 mg/dl. Cell medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), 1% L-glutamine (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United States) and 1% HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) were added to prevent bacterial contamination.

Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 5 days.  CD8+ T-Cell Cell Isolation  Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells were isolated from stimulated Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) via microbead-based separation using the AutoMACSPro Separator following the manufacturer’s instructions (Human CD8 MicroBeads, # 130-045-201, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Prior to separation, CD3/CD28 Dynabeads were removed magnetically.",c5ba2c35-815e-43d9-a014-4b385d32c919
3,methods4,"  Cytotoxicity Assay  Analysis of CD8+ T-cell lysis capacity was carried out using a calcein-acetoxymethyl (AM) lysis assay, cultivating calcein AM-labeled K562 lymphoblasts (target cells) with CD8+ T cells (8μM calcein AM; #C1359, Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Upon cell lysis of target cells, calcein fluorescence was determined on the FilterMax F3 MultiMode Microplate Reader (excitation filter: 480 nm; emission filter: 520 nm | Molecular devices. LLC, San Jose, CA, United States). Relative cell lysis capacity was calculated using the formula [(test release – spontaneous release)/(maximum release – spontaneous release)] × 100.  Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay  Quantification of secreted proteins was performed by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (Enzyme linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)) (IFNγ: #430104; TNFα: #430204; Granzyme B: #439207; Biolegend, San Diego, CA, United States | Perforin: #3465-1HP-2, Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden).",8bf2c7ce-6896-4187-a451-40d62b25027a
4,methods5," Assays were conducted following the manufacturer‘s protocol. Absorbance was measured using a Filtermax F3 and concentrations of target proteins quantified by plate-specific standard curves.  Oxygen Consumption Rate and Extracellular Acidification Rate  Mitochondrial respiratory and glycolytic capacity were evaluated using a Seahorse XF HS Mini for extracellular flux analysis (Agilent, Santa Clara, United States). CD8+ T cells were seeded into the wells of a poly-L-lysine (Biochrom, # L7240, Berlin, Germany) coated 8-well HS mini plate (#103723-100, Agilent, Santa Clara, United States). Seahorse RPMI (#103576-100, Agilent, Santa Clara, United States) supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine and 5.5 mM glucose served as assay medium. Experiments were run in duplicates or triplicates with 70,000 cells per well.",8ca112bc-dbde-4e16-b96d-544460ab105e
5,methods6," Extracellular acidification rate (Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)) and oxygen consumption rate (oxygen consumption rate (OCR)) were measured in response to Mito Stress Test (#103015-100). To this end, final well concentrations of 1 μM Oligomycin, 1 μM FCCP and 0.5 μM Rotenone/Antimycin A were loaded into the respective compound delivery ports of the sensor cartridge and added sequentially during analysis.  Mitochondrial Membrane Potential  To examine mitochondrial membrane potential ΔψM, the cationic carbocyanine membrane-permeable dye JC1 was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Item No. 701560, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, United States). Data were acquired on a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, United States). In intact mitochondria, ΔψM-dependent JC-1 accumulation leads to the formation of J-aggregates that emit red fluorescence (∼ 590 nm).",e9f2cf55-b5e5-4883-bfad-640525f43e1c
6,methods7," Depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential results in lower cellular concentrations of the dye, then forming green fluorescent monomeric forms of JC1 (∼ 529 nm). ΔψM is represented as the ratio of the mean fluorescence intensities of red to green. The decoupling agent FCCP (Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) was applied as a negative control, causing an almost complete disruption of ΔψM.  Cellular Reactive Oxygen Species  Quantification of intracellular reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) was performed using CellROX Green (C10492, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. N-acetylcysteine (N acetylcysteine (NAC)) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tert butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Analysis was performed on a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, United States).",6be040ec-36bf-4757-825b-fbd1f6ce165f

Data were acquired on a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, United States).  Mitochondrial Mass Determination  MitoTracker Green FM (#9074, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, United States) was used for flow cytometric determination of mitochondrial mass (200 nM MitoTracker in the dark, 37°C, 15 min). Mitochondrial mass per cell was subsequently obtained by quantification of mean fluorescence intensity (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)) green on a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, United States).  Flow Cytometry  Antibody staining for flow cytometric analyses was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols.

Intracellular staining of Interferon γ, Granzyme B and Perforin 1 was carried out using FITC anti-human Interferon γ (#502506, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, United States), BV421 anti-human Granzyme B (#396413, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, United States) and APC anti-human Perforin 1 (#308111, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, United States) after cells had been fixed and permeabilized using eBioscience™ Fixation/Permeabilization Concentrate, Diluent and Buffer (#00-5123-43 | #00-5223-56 | #00-8333-56, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, United States) as to the manufacturer’s protocol.",2dd02a26-1bef-4552-a0d7-7a59a88c27b5
9,methods10," Flow cytometry data were acquired on a FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, United States). Data analyses were performed using FlowJo v10 (FlowJo, Ashland, United States).  mRNA Expression Analysis  Expression of mRNA was quantified on a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) as previously described (9, 10). In brief, RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy RNA Isolation Kit (#217004, Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). After on-column DNA digestion, cDNA was synthesized from equal amounts of RNA using a Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States), random hexamers and oligo (dT) primers. Succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (subunit A (SDHA)), and TATA Box Binding Protein (TATA Box Binding Protein (TBP)) served as reference genes in all experiments. Primers and probes are specified in Supplementary Table 1. The second derivative maximum method was used to determine quantification cycles by the LightCycler software.",090d4270-fb69-4c46-a053-04d0975e1279
10,methods11," Quantification cycle (Cq) cut-off was defined for Cq 35, values beyond cut-off were considered unspecific.  Statistical Analyses  Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.2 (GraphPad Software, Inc., United States). Paired t-test or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, as appropriate, served for comparisons. Normal distribution was tested using the D’Agostino and Pearson test.

11,results0," Study subjects exhibited disease severity WHO grade IV or above and respiratory failure requiring continuous oxygen insufflation. Patient characteristics are depicted in Table 1. Lymphocytes were subjected to an established cell culture model (8) and cultivated with D/L-BHB (BHB+) under T-cell specific stimulation (CD3/CD28 dynabeads, Supplementary Figures 1A–D). These cells will be referred to as BHB+ CD8+ T cells.  COVID-19 has been shown to severely impair CD8+ T-cell immunity. One hallmark of this cell exhaustion is a decline in cell number (1). Laboratory results of our study cohort corroborate these findings by displaying reduced T lymphocyte and cytotoxic T lymphocyte numbers in COVID-19 patients (Table 1). To evaluate the effect of BHB on the immune function of CD8+ lymphocytes, we performed flow cytometric analysis of intracellular cytokines.",bb6d1225-041d-4c1a-98e0-9246fdf5636f
12,results1," We detected a significant increase of BHB+CD8+ T cells expressing the central cytolytic protein granzyme B (Figure 1A) and a substantially augmented granzyme B expression per cell (+ 12% ± 5.4%, p = 0.038) (Figure 1B). Functional investigations revealed a profound enhancement of CD8+ immune capacity during COVID-19 upon BHB incubation. Secretion of CD8+ T-cell cytokines IFNγ (+ 8.3% ± 2.2%, p = 0.0026), TNFα (+ 16% ± 7.9%, p = 0.0248), Perforin (+ 24% ± 11%, p = 0.045) and Granzyme B (+ 19% ± 5.2%, p = 0.0023) was markedly elevated (Figure 1C). Consequently, BHB+CD8+ T cells were found to have significantly increased cell lysis capacity (+ 21% ± 4.9%, p = 0.0043; Figure 1D). Taken together, we provide evidence for substantial augmentation of COVID-19 patients’ CD8+ T-cell response after treatment with BHB.

14,results3," Paired t-test or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, as appropriate. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.  In healthy subjects undergoing KD, immunometabolic reprogramming of T cells occurs, which enables higher mitochondrial energy production through oxidative phosphorylation (8). To evaluate whether ketone bodies also enhance CD8+ T-cell energy levels during COVID-19, we performed Seahorse analyses. BHB+CD8+ T cells displayed significantly higher basal (+ 17% ± 9.4%, p = 0.0463) and maximum respiratory chain activity (+ 34.6% ± 25.3%, p = 0.0294) as well as superior spare respiratory capacity (+ 42% ± 30.5%, p = 0.0315), providing evidence for strengthened mitochondrial energy production (Figures 2A–D and Supplementary Figure 1D). Of note, this metabolic rewiring did not come at the expense of cellular glycolysis, as extracellular acidification rate did not decrease in BHB+CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Figure 1E).",aa9eb64c-4a50-4d6e-a4ad-3bc8137753f7
15,results4," These functional results were complemented by structural analyses, showing a trend toward increased mitochondrial mass in BHB+CD8+ T cells (+ 26% ± 17.7%; Figure 2E). Collectively, these data indicate that ketone bodies direct human CD8+ T cells toward aerobic mitochondrial metabolism during COVID-19, thereby enabling superior energy supply.  FIGURE 2 Beta-hydroxybutyrate shifts human T-cell metabolism toward oxidative phosphorylation enabling higher mreactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

Mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes are the main source for reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) (11). Mitochondrial [m]reactive oxygen species (ROS) are indispensable for an adequate T-cell immune response (12, 13).",3a4c9fac-82df-4d3d-9e6d-28bda15bb8d6
17,results6," Thus, we investigated whether augmented reactive oxygen species (ROS) production due to elevated OXPHOS activity in BHB+CD8+ T cells provides an additional basis for the reported augmentation of cytotoxic immune function during COVID-19. Indeed, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly elevated after incubation with ketone bodies (+ 12% ± 5.9%, p = 0.0029, Figure 2F). Of note, we did not detect uncontrolled expansion of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) remained unchanged (Supplementary Figure 2A), highlighting the concept of mitohormesis (14, 15). Consequently, neither cellular expression of anti-oxidative glutathione nor the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane were impaired upon incubation with ketone bodies (Supplementary Figures 2B,C). Of note, analysis of CD4+ T-cells showed no alteration to mitochondrial mass or reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in response to BHB (Supplementary Figures 2D–H).",4db6a91f-a496-43b2-b7bd-086fbe8b6979
18,results7," In conclusion, these findings demonstrate an increase of [m]reactive oxygen species (ROS) production serving as T-cell second messenger in BHB+CD8+ T cells without compromising cell viability. ",bc956c6e-bbbe-4a65-9233-cfee3971d1fa
19,discussion0," We have recently reported a strong positive impact of a KD on human T-cell immune capacity in healthy volunteers (8). In the current study, we found the same pattern of effects in disease: The attenuated CD8+ T-cell functions of severely diseased COVID-19 patients were significantly empowered. Again, this phenomenon was based on a higher respiratory capacity -enabling superior energy production- and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) which serve as T-cell second messenger. It is conceivable that the observed effects of ketone bodies represent evolutionary conserved mechanisms for stabilizing human immunity in health and disease.  Functional exhaustion of T-cells is known to be linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, we hypothesized that mitochondrial empowerment through BHB could improve T-cell function during COVID-19. We provide evidence for an increased energetic capacity of BHB+CD8+ T-cells during COVID-19.",4507038d-36c9-4461-ae50-3b54b7589332
20,discussion1," T cells are capable of using BHB via Krebs cycle oxidation, which is known to fuel OXPHOS with superior efficacy (16, 17). Therefore, augmented cellular energy supply through metabolization of BHB could enable an enhanced immune response of CD8+ T-cells.  Elevated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation translates into increased mreactive oxygen species (ROS), as respiratory chain complexes are the major source of mreactive oxygen species (ROS) (18). T-cell activation and function inevitably relies on mreactive oxygen species (ROS), rendering them a pivotal signaling molecule for T-cell immunity (12, 19). We show increased mreactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to BHB, which might provide the second immunometabolic basis for the augmented CD8+ T-cell immune capacity.  Patients Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were incubated using 10 mM D/L-BHB.",da32023c-ea91-4ff5-8ae4-58f9e671ac2d
21,discussion2," As only D-BHB is metabolically active (7, 20–22), this refers to 5 mM D-BHB, which is similar to maximum blood ketone levels achievable via ad libitum KD (8). Since in vitro no BHB synthesis is occurring, higher initial BHB concentrations must be used to ensure adequate ketosis during cell culture. Of note, BHB concentration in cell culture medium at the end of incubation was in the range of 2 mM, thus almost identical to mean blood BHB in vivo (Supplementary Figure 2I). Accordingly, lower initial concentrations of BHB in vitro did not evoke comparably positive effects on human T-cell immunometabolism. On a KD, exogenous supply of ketone esters or the use of MCT oil could help to achieve blood ketone levels close to 2 mM BHB.  In our previous investigations, KD had only a limited effect on CD4+ T-cells. In the current study, again, CD4+ T-cells do not respond to BHB. CD4+ T cells are essential regulators of the human immune system (23).",b0f1cbc4-6174-4191-b08d-2c102fea4272
22,discussion3," They can be further divided into distinct subsets with individual immunological function and metabolic characteristics (24, 25). We assume that this subset heterogeneity might be responsible for amelioration of the overall effect of KD when analyzing bulk CD4+ T-cells. Thus, further studies are required to dissect the impact of KD on individual CD4+ T-cell subsets in health and disease.  Due to their multidimensional beneficial immunometabolic effects, ketone bodies have been proposed as a countermeasure against viral infections (26). To date, no study investigated the impact of BHB on human viral infections. In mice, BHB has already shown to induce a protective immune response against influenza virus infection (27). Similarly, in beta coronavirus-infected mice, KD improved γδ T-cell immunity and dampened inflammation (28). The potential benefit of KD also expands to other immune cell types.",d43ddfd7-60d3-4a74-a0d4-091f96c8e270
23,discussion4," Macrophages contribute to detrimental immune responses to COVID-19, which could be ameliorated through redirection of M1 to M2 phenotype via metabolic rewiring on a KD (29). Beyond immunological effects, KD has been proposed as a metabolic therapy against COVID-19 through restoration of systemic energy metabolism (30). Of note, KD in vivo might evoke additional positive effects: carbohydrate restriction results in diminished levels of glucose and insulin, thus breaking the cycle of glucose-insulin-dependent inflammation and immunosuppression (31–36). This could be of exceptional importance, since metabolic comorbidities have a devastating impact on COVID-19 patients (37–40).  Consequently, a retrospective data analysis of COVID-19 patients on a KD revealed correlations to a reduced mortality (41). Prospective randomized clinical trials will now have to evaluate the precise impact of BHB on human metabolism in vivo during COVID-19.",3c412b30-237c-4708-b1a4-ca481513625d
24,discussion5,"  Our study paves the road for the development of metabolic treatment strategies against COVID-19, which now have to be evaluated within the framework of controlled prospective studies. Of note, the required nutrition formula and protocols are already available.
