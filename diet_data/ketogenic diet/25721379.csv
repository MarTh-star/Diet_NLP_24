0,introduction0," Neuroblastoma (NB) represents the most common extracranial solid childhood cancer. Marked biological and clinical heterogeneity, pose strong challenges to optimizing therapeutic interventions for individual cases. Among others biological risk factors include MYCN status, tumor histology, cancer cell DNA content and defined segmental chromosomal aberrations [1–5]. In combination with historical clinical data, tumor biology allows clinicians to guide therapy by stratifying patients into internationally accepted risk groups [6, 7]. In low- and intermediate-risk groups, with overall survival rates above 90%, recent studies have been focusing on reducing therapeutic toxicity. For patients in the high-risk group, however, improving treatment efficacy is still central with overall survival rates close to 50% despite multimodal therapy protocols [1].",80de2eb9-b3c5-429c-9a2a-fabe38545fe3
1,introduction1,"  With regard to cellular metabolism NBs share the characteristic reprogramming to high glucose uptake recently added to the hallmarks in cancer [8–10]. This preferential utilization of glucose via aerobic glycolysis even under sufficient oxygen to shunt pyruvate into oxidative phosphorylation (oxygen to shunt pyruvate into oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)) pathway, is commonly described as Warburg effect [11, 12]. Whereas defects in single oxygen to shunt pyruvate into oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits can be a direct cause of the Warburg effect [13–15], other cancers show a general pattern of low oxygen to shunt pyruvate into oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity [16–19]. In NB, both primary tumor tissue and xenografts display generalized low mitochondrial respiratory chain activity [20, 21]. This metabolic feature might indicate a dependency on glucose not only for anabolic processes, but also for energy production.",f96050d8-55a3-416b-91e3-5c1d51365c95
2,introduction2," Based on this theory, we recently reported a preclinical study showing significant tumor growth inhibitory effects of dietary intervention in a NB xenograft model [21]. In that study we observed that a mild ketogenic diet (KD) and/or calorie restricted (CR) diet altered blood metabolic parameters (reduced glucose and increased beta-hydroxybutyrate levels) and induced significant growth inhibition of NB xenografts. Detailed evaluation of mitochondrial oxygen to shunt pyruvate into oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) parameters showed no adaptive response in the NB tumors [21].  These growth inhibitory effects are in line with preclinical data on cancers of the central nervous system suggesting that CR-KD might constitute an adjuvant approach in cancer therapy [22–25]. Effects of CR and/or KD in diverse preclinical cancer models have recently been reviewed [26, 27].",d17101d8-ea3d-420a-b18e-23bbcda854f0
3,introduction3," Anecdotal case reports of cancer patients treated with CR-KD support a possible inhibitory effect on tumor growth, but comprehensive preclinical and clinical evaluation is lacking [28–30]. Pilot studies of KD in adult patients showed that it might be tolerated in patients with advanced cancers [31–33].  Because targeting cancer metabolism is complementary to current treatment strategies for NB, it could potentially open a new front against this tumor entity. The current study therefore aims to investigate the combination of KD and/or CR diet with a low-dose metronomic cyclophosphamide (Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP)) chemotherapy regimen. Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) has been shown to effectively inhibit neoangiogenesis in xenograft models of different tumor entities [34–36] and is under clinical evaluation [37–40]. We hypothesize that concurrent targeting of tumor vascularization and cancer cell metabolism might constitute a cooperative therapeutic approach. ",820b63df-cd29-4d36-92ee-23f10c70c79b
4,methods0," Cell lines Neuroblastoma xenografts were established with the cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) SH-SY5Y (CRL-2266) and SK-N-BE(2) (CRL-2271). SH-SY5Y is a TP53 wild type, non-MYCN-amplified cell line with no chromosome 1p loss of heterozygosity and is sensitive to chemotherapy. The SK-N-BE(2) cell line is highly resistant to a wide range of chemotherapeutic agents and is characterized by MYCN-amplification, TP53 mutation (p.C135F) and chromosome 1p loss of heterozygosity [41]. Cells were cultured in standard conditions as described earlier [21]. MYCN expression on protein level was confirmed on western blot and is given in Supplementary Figure S7.  Animal models and sample preparation All in vivo experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved for this study by the Salzburg Animal Care and Use Committee (Nr.: 20901-TVG/44/7-2011). This protocol specifically addressed weight loss observed in response to dietary intervention.",30ffa683-f71e-4a75-b207-acca70a71bd1
5,methods1," Animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and care conformed to the Austrian Act on Animal Experimentation. Xenograft growth was induced on the right flanks of 5-to 6-week-old female CD-1 nude mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA) by subcutaneous injection of a 200 μl suspension of NB cells (2.7 × 107) in serum-free medium and matrigel (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). After reaching a tumor size of 350 mm3, an oral metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment was started and mice were randomized to four dietary therapy groups (SD, CR-SD, KD and CR-KD; n = 10–12). One control group on standard diet without chemotherapy was included for both cell lines (SD w/o CTx; n = 8–9).  Two times per week, tumor volumes were measured using a caliper and calculated according to the formula width × height × length/2.",708065aa-c1cd-4cc8-82e9-9faed60312f5
6,methods2," Body weight was recorded and blood glucose and ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate) levels were monitored using enzyme based methods twice weekly (Precision Xceed, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). In the ad libitum-fed groups, measurements were performed after a two-hour fasting period or before feeding in the calorie restricted groups. Animals in CR groups were single-housed to control food intake. Ad libitum-fed mice were group housed. Mice were sacrificed at day 36 or when termination criteria were met (health status, tumor ulceration or volume of 3000 mm3). Images of the xenografts were recorded at the start of therapy, and before and after removal of the tumor. Cancer tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. One 0.5 cm tumor slice each was formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded for histological analysis.",bb859761-f7a8-451a-b97d-c3f414637d22
7,methods3,"  Food composition and energy content Mice were fed according to four different regimens: standard diet ad libitum (SD), calorie restricted standard diet (CR-SD), long-chain fatty acid-based ketogenic diet ad libitum (KD) and calorie-restricted ketogenic diet (CR-KD). Detailed food composition and feeding protocols to evaluate the dietary intervention on NB-tumor growth were published previously [21] and are given in the Supplementary Data (Table S4). In brief, the metabolizable energy contents were: SD (kcal: fat 9%, protein 33% and carbohydrates 58%) and mild KD (kcal: fat 78%, protein 14% and carbohydrates 8%) (No. V1535-000 and No. S9139-E02D; Sniff Spezialdiäten GmbH, Soest, D). Diets were fortified with vitamins and mineral supplements. For the CR groups, food intake was restricted to 2/3 of the respective ad libitum intake, which aligns with clinical protocols for therapy-resistant epilepsy [67–69].",c9fd5116-3d64-45fa-aa9d-c5a243680191
8,methods4,"  Metronomic cyclophosphamide (Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP)) schedule CP (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was administered orally through the drinking water as described previously [70]. In order to achieve the described oral dose of 40 mg/kg CP per day, final CP concentration in drinking water was 0.266 mg/ml [70]. Analogous Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) regimens were applied to target neoangiogenesis in xenograft models of other tumor entities [34–36] and have low toxicities [70, 71]. Average water/CP intake per mouse was equal between different diet groups.  In vitro CP sensitivity In vitro CP sensitivity of both cell lines was evaluated by utilizing 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC, Niomech, Bielefeld, D), an active metabolite of CP. Cells were seeded in 96 well plates (25 000/well). After resting for 48 hours, standard medium was replaced by 100 μl medium containing 4-HC (0.157 – 10 nM).",0cf49dbc-b1cc-4fe0-82f4-6f83712cfbb5
9,methods5," 4-HC was freshly dissolved in DMSO (Sigma), and control medium contained the maximum DMSO concentration (0.01%). After three hours of drug exposure, the medium was replaced by 100 μl standard medium for 24 hours to allow the cytotoxicity to fully develop. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Absorbance was read at 570 nm with an EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Results were normalized to background and are given as metabolic activity relative to control (100%). The average of two independent experiments with 6 replicates each is shown.

10,methods6," Hematoxylin/eosin and Van Gieson staining as well as immunohistochemistry (immunohistochemistry (IHC)) stainings (Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), PHH3 (phospho-histone H3), Ki67) were carried out within the routine diagnostic setting at the local pathology department following standard protocols. Antibodies were used at the following dilutions: 1:100 for anti-Bcl-2 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), 1:200 for anti-PHH3 (Cellmarque, Rocklin, CA, USA) and 1:500 for anti-Ki67 (Dako). Angiogenesis, intratumoral hemorrhage and Bcl-2 staining were scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (strong). Proliferation indices were scored by evaluating the proportion of positively stained nuclei scoring at least 500 cells per slide (Ki67) or counting the number of positively stained tumor nuclei per high-power field (PHH3/HPF). For adequately sized tumors, at least five representative regions were scored; magnification was 400-fold.",0c549218-bdb2-445d-b138-6ba0e97e1575
11,methods7," When the tumor size was too small, stained nuclei/total tumor cells were counted and converted to a HPF equivalent. Anti-msCD31 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and anti-HIF1A (hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, Novus, Littleton, USA) stainings were carried out at a dilution of 1:50 and 1:100, respectively, following protocols for immunohistochemistry (IHC)-staining described earlier [19, 72]. For detection EnVision kit reagents (Dako) were used following the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of histological staining was performed by two blinded investigators, and the mean of both scores was calculated.  Western blot analysis Whole-cell lysates for western blot analysis were prepared using standard radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. In brief, 30 μg protein were separated on 10% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide gels before transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using CAPS buffer (10 mM 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propane sulfonic acid, pH 11; 10% methanol).",14e40cb9-1b63-4400-b375-f02f1f80585c

Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were used (Dako) and detection was carried out with Lumi-Light POD-substrate (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Quantification of band intensities was performed using Image Lab Software 5.2.1 (Bio-Rad) and adapted to the corresponding loading control.  Statistics Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test (two groups; p < 0.05) and one-way ANOVA (more than two groups; p < 0.05). To adapt for multiple comparisons two-tailed Dunnett's posttest was used. In these cases multiplicity adjusted p-value is given.

13,methods9," The analyses were performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) and SPSS 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The fractional product of Webb was used to determine whether the observed effects show synergistic or additive nature. The method uses the formula: i1,2 = i1*i2; where i1,2 is the inhibitory fraction of the combination of two interventions i1 (cyclophosphamide) and i2 (diet). When the predicted response exceeds the measured response, synergism is claimed (Ratio calculated/hypothetical < 1) [44].  SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURES AND TABLES  The authors thank PD Dipl Ing.

15,results0," Inhibition of NB tumor growth by Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) in combination with dietary intervention In an effort to exploit a potential synergism of targeting vascular supply and cancer cell metabolism, we chose to combine dietary intervention with Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP). In the presented model, Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) induced significant growth inhibition (p < 0.001) of NB xenografts of both cell lines tested from day 9 onward and extended survival (p < 0.001) compared to the corresponding standard diet group without Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) (SD group w/o CTx; Figure 1). Intriguingly on the metronomic dosing protocol, growth inhibition of SK-N-BE(2) tumors was more pronounced versus that of tumors of the reportedly more chemotherapy sensitive SH-SY5Y cell line [41–43]. In addition to the chemotherapy-induced growth reduction, SH-SY5Y tumors showed a significant additional growth inhibition in all three dietary intervention groups (Figure 1A1).",ab214919-900d-435e-bbb5-f4894576a35d
16,results1," On day 36, tumor volume in the SD group was significantly greater compared to that of the calorie restricted-standard diet (CR-SD) group (p < 0.05), the KD group (p < 0.01) and the CR-KD group (p < 0.001). In the SK-N-BE(2) xenografts tumor growth was significantly inhibited in the restricted diet groups (Figure 1B1) CR-SD (p < 0.05) and CR-KD (p < 0.05). Based on the strong effect of Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) on SK-N-BE(2) tumor growth, observed absolute effect size of dietary intervention was limited. One mouse in the CR-SD group was found dead on day 22 form an undetermined cause. CR-KD in combination with Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) resulted in tumor regression all cases of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2). The fractional product of Webb [44] on the last day with available control tumor data showed synergism for KD and CR-KD for SH-SY5Y and CR-SD and KD for SK-N-BE(2).",04e34845-cbf7-499a-8b6e-a5fffcda49a6
17,results2," For the CR-SD an additive effect and for the CR-KD in SK-N-BE(2) antagonism was observed (Supplementary Table S3). These results need to be interpreted with caution due to the small tumor size in the SK-N-BE(2) and the lack of dosing curves [44].  Figure 1 Dietary intervention enhances the growth inhibitory effect of Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) on NB xenografts After establishing tumors, mice were randomized to therapy and control groups as indicated.

In vitro 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) sensitivity Because the in vivo results showed Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) to be more active against xenografts of the reportedly chemotherapy-resistant cell line SK-N-BE(2), we compared the in vitro CP-sensitivity of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2) to confirm the data reported in the literature [41–43]. We therefore titrated 4-HC concentration (active metabolite of CP) to a dose-range, in which both cell lines showed either complete cell death (10 nM) or no difference in survival (0.313 nM) under the conditions tested. At all intermediate doses SH-SY5Y showed significantly higher sensitivity to 4-HC (Supplementary Figure S6).",445c7c6c-b9aa-4193-9568-7b6a4f80ba9e
27,results12," From these data we hypothesized that, rather than a direct cytotoxic effect, an indirect effect on xenograft growth may be rendering SK-N-BE(2) tumors more susceptible to Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP).

Macroscopic observation of intratumoral hemorrhage Macroscopic inspection and evaluation of photo documentation showed a tendency to stronger intratumoral hemorrhage in the SK-N-BE(2) xenografts compared to SH-SY5Y xenografts (Figure 4A1 and 4B1). We therefore quantified macroscopic hemorrhage at day 36 or the last day of therapy (Figure 4A2 and 4B2). In the SK-N-BE(2) group on SD w/o CTx, 100% (8/8) of tumors showed pronounced macroscopic hemorrhage.

Effect of Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) on microscopic tumor vascularization, hemorrhage and vessel maturation To further substantiate the results from macroscopic inspection, tumor vascularization and intratumoral hemorrhage were studied on tumor sections stained with Hematoxylin/Eosin (Figure 5A1 and 5B1). In line with the macroscopic observations, vascularization and hemorrhage were significantly higher in the SK-N-BE(2) xenografts compared to SH-SY5Y tumors. Upon Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) treatment, hemorrhage in both xenograft types was significantly reduced (p < 0.01).

30,results15,"05), maturation of blood vessels was observed in xenografts of this cell type (Figure 6B). Angiogenesis scoring across all subgroups is given in Supplementary Figure S5. The change in vessel structure seemed even more fundamental than the reduction of vessel number. Increased nuclear accumulation of HIF1A was evident in the SK-N-BE(2) xenografts exposed to Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP). This was accompanied by central regions of cell death (Figure 5C) and VEGF up-regulation (Figure 5D). Increased VEGFA could not compensate for the anti-angiogenic effect of the Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) therapy. It can be speculated that the marked increase in diffusion distance (as can be seen in Figure 6B1 and 6B2, right) likely contributes to the increasing tissue hypoxia and cell death as depicted in Figure 5C.

Under Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) treatment, however, in addition to a reduction of overall blood vessel density, a pronounced maturation of blood vessels was evident in SK-N-BE(2) tumors (Figure 6B1 and 6B2, right). No tumor cell invasion into vascular structures was observed in SK-N-BE(2) xenografts exposed to Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP).

35,results20," Compared to SD tumors w/o CTx Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) treated tumors showed a tendency towards decreased cellularity and reduced nucleus/cytosol ratio in both SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2) xenografts.  Diametrically opposed regulation of Bcl-2 protein levels in SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2) tumors under Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) For both cell lines used in our study, Bcl-2 expression was described previously [46] and was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC)-staining in our study. Under continuous Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) treatment, SH-SY5Y xenografts of mice on SD showed a progressive increase in tumor volumes starting around treatment day 16. Along with this resistance, significantly higher Bcl-2 (p < 0.01; Figure 7A) expression was evident in xenografts exposed to Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) treatment compared to SD w/o CTx.",15d1ca74-d931-4a6f-916d-bfec53b09712
36,results21," This is in line with the literature for NB tumors, which suggest Bcl-2 upregulation as a mechanism of chemotherapy resistance under standard treatment [47, 48]. Consistent with the tumor cell characteristics [48] (chemotherapy resistant and MYCN amplified) the SK-N-BE(2) cell line showed increased basal Bcl-2 protein expression levels in the untreated group when compared to SH-SY5Y. On Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) treatment, however, Bcl-2 protein levels were significantly reduced in the SK-N-BE(2) xenografts (p < 0.001; Figure 7B). Whereas Bcl-2 staining was more preserved in vascularized areas, it was particularly low with increased distance to blood vessels (Figure 7B2, right). Western blot analysis (Figure 7C) supports the results from immunohistochemistry (IHC). Whereas SH-SY5Y tumors exhibited slightly increased Bcl-2 levels upon prolonged Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) treatment, SK-N-BE(2) tumors showed decreased levels.",222bb6d8-31e9-41ab-b23d-628a56e24138
37,results22," Concomitant with the decrease in Bcl-2 levels, an increase in cleaved caspase 3 was observed in Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP)-treated SK-N-BE(2) xenografts.

39,discussion0," The present study combines two alternative therapeutic approaches to reduce NB tumor growth in a preclinical model. In this setting, administering an anti-angiogenic Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) regimen with dietary intervention was able to significantly inhibit growth of NB xenografts of distinct genetic background and chemotherapy sensitivity.  In line with our previous work that focused exclusively on the effect of dietary intervention [21], KD and/or CR reduced glucose availability and increased blood ketone body levels in mice. Significant reductions of tumor growth, in addition to Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) treatment, was evident in all dietary intervention groups except for the SK-N-BE(2) xenograft group on KD. Although dietary effects in the SK-N-BE(2) subgroup should be interpreted with caution due to the small absolute tumor size, results of different subgroups align with our previous work [21].",572109d8-db94-4cf7-9c8b-c3e066564683
40,discussion1," This supports the metabolic dependency of NBs and their limited capacity to adapt to the change in nutrient supply.  In contrast to other studies on the effect of KD and/or CR on tumor growth [21, 49–51], we not only observed growth inhibition, but also regression of tumor volume. Intriguingly, the combination of Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) and CR-KD induced a significant reduction of tumor size and complete growth arrest of NB xenografts of both cell lines tested. This highlights the importance of combining dietary intervention with other therapeutic approaches as it might sensitize tumors to the cytotoxic effects of these therapeutics. In line with our data, enhancement of anti-tumor effect has been described in additional preclinical studies [52–54].  For NB, increased vascularization has been proposed to correlate with high-risk tumor stage and poor clinical outcome [55–57]. Targeting neovascularization has therefore been put forward as a therapeutic option [58–61].",08f4e857-cef3-4b5f-834f-e418a9bd826c
41,discussion2," Furthermore, a direct link between MYCN amplification and enhanced angiogenesis has been described [55, 62, 63]. In accord we observed increased angiogenesis and a highly invasive growth pattern in xenografts of the MYCN-amplified cell line. Upon Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) treatment, this phenotype changed to a mature vessel pattern with strong perivascular collagen deposition and without vascular invasion of tumor cells. To our knowledge this effect has not been described before. The change in vessel structure presumably resulted in undersupplied tumors due to the increased diffusion distance. This interpretation is supported by the increase in hypoxic areas with central cell death as seen on HIF1A staining. Direct evidence for nutrient deprivation, however, is pending.",e338d717-2f90-45f0-a557-05f12d876636
42,discussion3,"  Whereas the SH-SY5Y xenografts in the SD group developed resistance to the Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) regimen that was accompanied by up-regulation of Bcl-2 levels, in the reportedly more chemotherapy-resistant SK-N-BE(2) xenografts [41–43], sensitivity was retained. The increased in vitro chemotherapy resistance of the SK-N-BE(2) cells supports an anti-tumor mechanism of Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP) that is not linked to a direct cytotoxic effect. Previous reports showed that in vitro hypoxia can trigger an autocrine loop via increased VEGF expression to induce Bcl-2 mediated chemotherapy resistance in SK-N-BE(2) cells [64, 65]. Although our model supports findings of increased VEGFA expression in response to hypoxia, this loop was not sufficient to induce Bcl-2-mediated tumor cell survival in the in vivo setting.",9857a0af-6891-4578-9294-3ff8f75fce6f
43,discussion4,"  This finding might highlight the importance of a concomitant decrease in nutrient supply that accompanies the state of low vascularization in tumors which is often not prioritized in in vitro studies [64, 65]. Supporting published work on an anti-angiogenic effect of KD [66], we observed the strongest reduction of angiogenesis in the combination of KD with Metronomic cyclophosphamide (MCP). Whereas both publications report a rarefication of blood vessels and hemorrhage, the fibrous depositions and vessel maturation are only described in our model.  Although we are aware of the limitations of an ectopic xenograft model and potential effects of additional molecular differences between the cell lines, the pronounced effect on tumor growth inhibition and blood vessel maturation could help to further clarify mechanisms in this molecular subgroup of NBs [62].",fae4cc51-cf9a-4d30-bdcf-9ddd7c9559ac
44,discussion5," It can be hypothesized, that along with the increased vascularization, also a stronger dependency on vascular supply is present for promoting tumor growth. Together with targeting cell metabolism this might constitute an Achilles heel worth aiming for to improve treatment for therapy-refractory NB.  ",391d84c5-5c86-4584-bba6-f01230ea6733
