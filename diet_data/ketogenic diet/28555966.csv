0,introduction0,"Accumulating evidence suggests that neuronal activity is tightly coupled to energy metabolism (Magistretti and Pellerin, 1996; Ames, 2000), which is not surprising given that the brain consumes ~20% of the body’s energy. Metabolic manipulation provides a unique strategy to regulate excessive neuronal activity (such as seizures), which is particularly important given that at least 1/3 of patients with epilepsy are resistant to drug treatment. One relevant example of seizure control through metabolism is the low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein, high-fat ketogenic diet (KD), which has proven to be highly effective in controlling many types of drug-refractory seizures (Freeman and Vining, 1998; Stafstrom and Rho, 2012; Thakur et al., 2014). More recently, a new approach has been to alter energy metabolism by inhibiting glycolysis with a non-metabolizable glucose analog, 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG).",c4c6a726-b4c6-41a8-8277-8c8baa4eafb6
1,introduction1," Partial inhibition of glycolysis with 2-DG blocks seizure activity in brain slices and in several animal models of seizures and epileptogenesis (Garriga-Canut et al., 2006; Stafstrom et al., 2009; Forte et al., 2016; Shao and Stafstrom, 2017).  The pentose phosphate pathway (pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)) is a secondary metabolic pathway that comprises a “branch” off glycolysis. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is stimulated by the glycolytic intermediate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP), diverting glycolysis into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which produces glutathione (glutathione (GSH)), an antioxidant and endogenous anticonvulsant (Abe et al., 2000; Figure 1). Therefore, stimulation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) has the potential to control excessive neuronal activity and seizures. Interestingly, a previous study reported that administration (i.p.",36b1e290-eb27-4600-b436-a1c794d459f2
2,introduction2,") of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) stimulator F1,6BP is associated with anticonvulsant effects in animal models , supporting the hypothesis that pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) may play an important role in regulating seizures. Yet, how pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) alters neural excitability and seizure activity is largely elusive.  Figure 1 The roles of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP) in glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)) and its proposed extracellular action. Diagram showing the main steps in glycolysis, its relationship to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the roles of F1,6BP. Glucose enters cytoplasm via glucose transporters (GLUT3 in neurons or GLUT1 in glia), where glycolysis takes place. Glucose is first phosphorylated to glucose-6-P (G6P), is further converted to F1,6BP, and is ultimately catalyzed to pyruvate, which then enters mitochondria to participate in the TCA cycle.",5243ebb0-3f16-4482-9a6a-87353f5de15f
3,introduction3," G6P also enters the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which generates reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)) and glutathione (glutathione (GSH)) to prevent the cell damage caused by reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)). Accumulation of F1,6BP weakly inhibits F6P conversion to F1,6BP, and potently shunts G6P into pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), leading to the production of glutathione (GSH). In addition, exogenous F1,6BP may interfere with voltage-gated calcium channels (voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC)) and reduce Ca2+ influx, based on evidence in this study.  In this study, we further examined the role of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in regulating neuronal excitability and seizure activity, by stimulating the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) with F1,6BP in hippocampal slices.",37d91d0e-9d11-4104-b4a2-03fbd4d59ef4
4,introduction4," We found that while F1,6BP consistently blocks epileptiform bursts in hippocampal slices, it does not significantly reduce intrinsic neuronal firing or excitatory synaptic transmission. Unexpectedly, F1,6BP directly blocks voltage-activated calcium current (ICa), an important contributor to epileptiform bursts. Thus, F1,6BP exerts its anti-epileptiform action partly through a previously unrecognized acute extracellular action to attenuate Ca2+ influx (Figure 1), at least in this in vitro seizure model. This novel mechanism of an intracellular metabolite on an extracellular target provides new insight into metabolic control of neural excitability and seizures.  ",01e65611-3f8a-4486-b355-8893254a92d7

14,results0,"F1,6BP Rapidly Blocks CA3 Epileptiform Population Bursts F1,6BP has previously been shown to exhibit a prominent anticonvulsant effect in several animal models of acute seizures . However, no study to date has studied F1,6BP effects on epileptiform activity in vitro. We first tested the hypothesis that F1,6BP blocks epileptiform activity in the CA3 area of hippocampal slices. Epileptiform population bursts were consistently induced in 0 Mg2+ aCSF with 50 μM 4-AP. Similar to our previous study (Shao and Stafstrom, 2017), these bursts were typically “interictal-like” discharges consisting of 1–4 short bursts, lasting for 100–500 ms and occurring at variable frequencies (Figures 2A,B). Bath application of F1,6BP (2.5–5 mM) markedly suppressed epileptiform bursts in majority (13 of 19, 68%) of the slices (Figures 2A–D). This dosage of F1,6BP is similar to previous in vitro studies (3.5 mM, Vexler et al., 2003); 10 mM, (Izumi et al.",e988a6b0-7bcb-4c2d-8eb4-e8d2c0fc92c1
15,results1,", 2003) and comparable to (but slightly lower than) in vivo studies (0.25–1 g/kg, ; 1 g/kg, ). More specifically, F1,6BP caused two types suppression: partial and complete. In partial suppression, epileptiform population bursts were minimized in amplitude by F1,6BP but did not disappear, and recovered quickly when F1,6BP was washed out from bathing medium (Figure 2A). In complete suppression, epileptiform bursts were fully abolished by F1,6BP and recovered much more slowly (up to 35 min; Figure 2B). Interestingly, single-unit activity in the slices was not blocked by F1,6BP (Figure 2B, middle inset). Overall, F1,6BP effectively inhibited epileptiform bursts activity in brain slices, corroborating its anticonvulsant effects in vivo . However, the rapid time to blockade with F1,6BP (4.2 ± 0.",cec109eb-0057-47e5-a783-f0d9a2d3979e
16,results2,"7 min, Figures 2A,B) was surprising, because it occurred faster than expected for an action mediated via an intracellular metabolic pathway (for comparison, glycolytic inhibition with 2-DG blocks similar epileptiform activity in CA3 in 14.2 ± 1.6 min; Shao and Stafstrom, 2017). Thus, we asked whether the quick F1,6BP effect might be mediated by an acute extracellular mechanism.  Figure 2 F1,6BP blocks epileptiform population bursts in the CA3 area of hippocampal slices. (A,B) Field-potential epileptiform bursts consistently occurred in 0 Mg2+ artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) with 50 μM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP).

F1,6BP Does Not Decrease Intrinsic Spontaneous Neuronal Firing To explore cellular mechanisms of F1,6BP on neuronal excitability and seizure susceptibility, we next tested its action on intrinsic firing of CA3 pyramidal neurons, which are known to fire action potentials spontaneously (Wong and Prince, 1978; Hablitz and Johnston, 1981; Traub and Wong, 1983).",b6f76036-79ad-4414-b6cc-d6e250d36c0c
18,results4," To minimize synaptic influence on intrinsic neuronal firing due to the dense interconnections between CA3 neurons, particularly at young ages (Miles and Wong, 1986; Shao and Dudek, 2009), we blocked AMPA-, NMDA- and GABAA receptors with DNQX (10 μM), AP-5 (50 μM) and SR95531 (10 μM), respectively. The average resting membrane potential (resting membrane potential (RMP)) of the recorded CA3 neurons was −66 ± 1.3 mV (n = 9). Most of these neurons (6/9) fired action potentials spontaneously at their resting membrane potential (RMP); the other neurons (3/9) were manually depolarized to ~60 mV via current injection to fire action potentials. Under these experimental conditions, the neurons fired action potentials continuously at an average frequency of ~2–3 Hz, mostly in bursts (Figures 3A–D), persisting for prolonged periods (up to >60 min).",24d39dd8-e63e-459d-8b97-eafd2b632595

F1,6BP Does Not Significantly Reduce Glutamatergic Synaptic Transmission Next, we asked whether F1,6BP blocked glutamatergic transmission, and tested its effect on excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSCAMPA) and excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSCNMDA) separately. excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSCAMPA) was evoked in the presence of AP-5 (50 μM) and SR95531 (10 μM) to block NMDA and GABAA receptors. The excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSCAMPA) was typically fast (~20 ms) with an amplitude of ~200 pA (Figure 4A). Addition of F1,6BP (5 mM) seemed to slightly reduce the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSCAMPA) but did not cause overall significant reduction (Figures 4A–C,G; 206 ± 23 pA vs. 173 ± 31 pA, p > 0.05, n = 9).",07694a75-3413-4f14-9fd0-fa6087ab102e
21,results7," excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSCNMDA) was evoked in Mg2+-free solution in the presence of DNQX (10 μM) and SR95531 (10 μM) to block AMPA and GABAA receptors, and held at −65 mV. The extracellular Ca2+ concentration was modestly elevated to 2 mM (from 1.3 mM) to partially compensate for membrane surface charge of Mg2+  and reduce multi-synaptic responses. Compared with excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSCAMPA), the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSCNMDA) was usually larger and much slower (>100 ms; Figure 4D). Application of F1,6BP tended to decrease the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSCNMDA) but the reduction was not significant overall (Figures 4E–G, 248 ± 45 pA vs. 186 ± 24 pA, p > 0.05, n = 8).

26,results12,"  F1,6BP Consistently Inhibits Voltage-Activated Calcium Currents (ICa) Given that two of the main contributors to epileptiform bursts, intrinsic neuronal firing and synaptic transmission, were not significantly altered by F1,6BP, it was reasonable to speculate that F1,6BP somehow acts through ICa, which is known to be essential for the generation of epileptiform bursts (Schwartzkroin and Wyler, 1980; Kohling et al., 2000; Siwek et al., 2012). To test this hypothesis, we evoked ICa in CA3 neurons using depolarizing voltage protocols (Figures 6A,E). ICa began to be activated at ~−40 mV and peaked at ~−10 mV (Figures 6E,F). ICa appeared to comprise a prominent inactivating component followed by a smaller steady-state component, and was completely abolished by the non-specific Ca2+ channel blocker, CdCl2 (100 μM; Figures 6A,E).",83bc9e95-6645-406e-b068-c6c1545473fb
27,results13," These data are consistent with a previous study that showed that immature CA3 neurons have significantly more prominent inactivating ICa than adult neurons (Thompson and Wong, 1991). The peak amplitude of ICa ranged from 400 pA to 1400 pA (on average: 996 pA, n = 9). Application of F1,6BP (5 mM) quickly (2–3 min) and consistently attenuated ICa by ~40% (Figures 6A–D, 996 ± 97 pA vs. 600 ± 62 pA, p < 0.001, n = 9). To test the whether F1,6BP can block ICa intracellularly, a subset of CA3 neurons were loaded with F1,6BP (5 mM) intracellularly through recording pipettes. In these neurons, the amplitude of ICa activated by the same protocol was similar to that in non-loaded neurons (Figure 6D, 938 ± 91 pA, n = 6; vs. 996 ± 97 pA, n = 9; p > 0.05). Moreover, further extracellular application of F1,6BP caused similar reduction of ICa in the F1, 6BP-loaded neuron (~40%, Figure 6D, 938 ± 91 vs. 598 ± 64, p < 0.001, n = 6).",f25d748a-e3d0-4772-8ad3-84e03fb34420
28,results14," These data suggest that F1,6BP most likely blocks ICa extracellularly rather than intracellularly. F1,6BP did not seem to alter the voltage dependence of ICa as it was activated at the same voltage range before and during F1,6BP application (Figure 6F). Steady-state inactivation, assessed by the amplitude of ICa after 1 s-long pre-pulses holding at different voltage levels (Figure 6G), was also not altered by F1,6BP. In fact, the inactivation kinetics of ICa before and during F1,6BP were almost identical (Figure 6H). Altogether, these data suggest that F1,6BP blocks a significant portion of ICa, which may account for its anticonvulsant action on epileptiform bursts.

Epileptiform Bursts in CA3 Are Ca2+ Dependent If it were true that F1,6BP blocks epileptiform bursts by reducing ICa, it would be expected that Ca2+ channel antagonists would also block epileptiform bursts as F1,6BP did. To confirm this, we applied CdCl2, a non-selective Ca2+ channel antagonist.",73d921af-71af-462d-83f9-663f0c17ac5a
31,results17," As expected, a low concentration of CdCl2 (20 μM) completely and reversibly blocked epileptiform bursts (Figures 7A–C). Similar to F1,6BP, CdCl2 did not block the single-unit activities in the slices (Figures 2B, 7A, middle insets). Taken together, these data confirm that the epileptiform bursts in CA3 are Ca2+-dependent and can be blocked by Ca2+ channel blockers or modulators (such as F1,6BP).  Figure 7 Epileptiform population bursts in CA3 are Ca2+-dependent.

The epileptiform bursts before, during, and after CdCl2 application indicated by arrows are shown in expanded time scale in insets below.

33,discussion0,"The main findings of the present study are: (1) the glucose metabolite and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) stimulator, F1,6BP, effectively blocks epileptiform activity in hippocampal slices; (2) F1,6BP does not stop intrinsic neuronal firing or significantly reduce AMPAR or NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents; (3) F1,6BP causes a reduction of GABAAR-mediated synaptic currents; (4) F1,6BP consistently attenuates ICa; and (5) epileptiform bursts in this model are Ca2+ dependent. To our knowledge, this is the first examination of the role of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in seizure reduction and the anticonvulsant action of F1,6BP in brain slices, focusing on underlying cellular mechanisms.  Novel Mechanism of F1,6BP’s Anti-Seizure Activity Our data in hippocampal slices corroborates the pioneering work showing that F1,6BP inhibits seizures in animal models . As in that study (Lian et al.",9021ba47-9117-44e3-960a-efd60352624c
34,discussion1,", 2007), we initially hypothesized that the anti-seizure activity of F1,6BP was mediated by an intracellular metabolic effect of shifting glycolysis to pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (Figure 1), thus promoting the production of the endogenous antioxidant and anticonvulsant, glutathione (GSH) . Yet, we noticed that the time to block epileptiform bursts by F1,6BP (4.2 ± 0.7 min) was much quicker than epileptiform bursts blocked by the glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG in our previous study (14.2 ± 1.6 min; Shao and Stafstrom, 2017). The short time to blockade suggested that F1,6BP might have a direct extracellular effect independent of its assumed intracellular effect and prompted us to examine its effect on extracellular mechanisms that contribute to neural excitability. However, F1,6BP did not stop neuronal firing nor did it significantly reduce excitatory synaptic transmission, two of the major contributors to epileptiform bursting (Traub and Wong, 1983).",081718fb-e9e8-4ce1-97b6-71df6f017810
35,discussion2," Finally and unexpectedly, we discovered that F1,6BP consistently blocks a significant portion of voltage-activated ICa extracellularly. Since epileptiform bursts in CA3 are Ca2+-dependent and readily blocked by Ca2+ channel blockade (CdCl2), these data strongly suggest that F1,6BP achieves its anticonvulsant activity in part by attenuating Ca2+ influx, at least in our in vitro seizure model.  Epileptiform bursts may be mediated by both presynaptic and postsynaptic Ca2+-dependent mechanisms. Presynaptic Ca2+ influx is important for transmitter release. Postsynaptic (somatic) ICa is known to be essential for the genesis and maintenance the plateau potentials of epileptiform bursts (Schwartzkroin and Wyler, 1980; Kohling et al., 2000; Siwek et al., 2012).",40908012-3de1-4bf3-83da-138208623d0e
36,discussion3," Our data that F1,6BP did not cause significant reduction in EPSCs suggest that F1,6BP blocks epileptiform bursts mainly by reducing postsynaptic (somatic) rather than presynaptic Ca2+ influx; and that a moderate reduction (40%) of postsynaptic Ca2+ influx is sufficient to block seizures. The 40% reduction of Ca2+ influx is derived from somatic high-voltage activated (high voltage activated (HVA)) Ca2+ currents. Whether presynaptic Ca2+ entry is similarly reduced by F1,6BP is unclear. Possibly, Ca2+ channels at presynaptic terminals of glutamatergic synapses may be less sensitive to F1,6BP or F1,6BP might block certain types Ca2+ channels that are not coupled to glutamate release . In contrast, Ca2+ influx at the GABAergic presynaptic terminals is likely affected by F1,6BP as indicated by the reduction of GABAA current. These data suggest that F1,6BP differentially affects glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission.",d6039001-d768-44c6-a1c6-ba6aa80eeb1a
37,discussion4," At the developmental period in this study (P8–16), the action of GABA on CA3 neurons is believed to have switched from excitatory (P0–P6) to inhibitory (Ben-Ari et al., 1990). However, the roles of GABAergic inhibition in seizures are complex. Recent studies have demonstrated that selective activation of perisomatic targeting interneurons (such as parvalbumin-expressing neurons) leads to initiation of seizures (Toyoda et al., 2015; Yekhlef et al., 2015; Khoshkhoo et al., 2017), while activation of axonic targeting interneurons (or axon-axonic synapses) inhibits seizures . In this study, we stimulated the CA3 pyramidal layer, where the axons of perisomatic interneurons are located, thus the resulting IPSCs are mostly derived from perisomatic synapses. A reduction in the strength of this type of inhibition by F1,6BP might therefore contribute to the reduction of epileptiform activity.",8ee91cd0-9a4b-42c5-994b-e08b1d408de5
38,discussion5," Whether F1,6BP exerts additional effects on intracellular metabolic pathways in our model remains to be determined. Apparently, the mechanisms underlying the anticonvulsant action of F1,6BP in animal models  are likely to be more complex than in brain slices. The extent to which this extracellular mechanism contributes to F1,6BP’s in vivo anticonvulsant action is uncertain. Arguably, administration of antioxidants does not consistently block seizures in the same animal models (Xu and Stringer, 2008), which suggests that F1,6BP may act on other targets in addition to pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activation and glutathione (GSH) production. Nonetheless, the present study revealed a novel extracellular mechanism of F1,6BP that may explain its anticonvulsant activity, at least in this in vitro model of seizures.",79b2f7af-1940-439b-ba8a-2617b53186f6
39,discussion6,"  CA3 neurons in the developing hippocampus possess both high voltage activated (HVA) and low-voltage activated (low voltage activated (LVA)) Ca2+ channels (Thompson and Wong, 1991). It is generally recognized that Ca2+ influx through high voltage activated (HVA) channels (particularly L- and R-types) are critically involved in the genesis of the plateau potential of epileptiform bursts , while Ca2+ influx through low voltage activated (LVA) channels (i.e., T-type) contributes to rebound bursting and pacemaking activity . The major component of ICa in the present study resembles the high voltage activated (HVA) inactivating currents (R, N-, P/Q) with an activation threshold of −40 mV and fast decay kinetics (Yamakage and Namiki, 2002; Lacinová, 2005; Catterall, 2011), mixed with a smaller component of non-inactivating current (L-type).",d574d816-40b9-4527-9748-99f6eca31e9b
40,discussion7," This is consistent with a previous study showing that inactivating ICa contributed to a significantly larger percentage of the total ICa in immature than adult CA3 neurons (Thompson and Wong, 1991). F1,6BP reduces the amplitude of ICa without altering channel activation and inactivation kinetics, suggesting that F1,6BP does not bind to high voltage activated (HVA) Ca2+ channels and works in a way that is different from conventional Ca2+ channel blockers. We did not further differentiate which specific subtypes of high voltage activated (HVA) Ca2+ channel are blocked by F1,6BP nor did we evaluate the effect of F1,6BP on low voltage activated (LVA) (T-type) ICa, which is beyond the main focus of the present study and may be addressed in future studies. Alternatively, F1,6BP may reduce Ca2+ influx by chelating Ca2+ ions because of its negative charges . A reduction of Ca2+ influx may also affect neuronal firing (by reducing Ca2+-activated K+ currents).",a2dc4ec0-201f-4e23-8a78-ca7c9cb68961
41,discussion8," Our data show that F1,6BP tends to increase neuronal firing but this effect did not reach statistical significance.  F1,6BP has previously been shown to be neuroprotective against hypoxic-ischemic injury (Farias et al., 1990; Kelleher et al., 1995; Sola et al., 1996) and excitotoxic injury  by stabilizing intracellular Ca2+ mediated by activation of phospholipase C (PLC; Donohoe et al., 2001; Fahlman et al., 2002; Rogido et al., 2003). Whether this mechanism occurs in seizures is not known. Also, we do not completely rule out the possibility that F1,6BP acts through an intracellular metabolic pathway (i.e., pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)), in addition to its action on Ca2+ channels. Theoretically, with its negative charge and lack of known transporter, it may be difficult for exogenous F1,6BP to enter cells, but several studies have shown a specific membrane permeability for F1,6BP (Hardin and Roberts, 1994; Wheeler et al., 2004; Wheeler and Chien, 2012).",f0b9e2dd-8ee7-4ab1-b031-322942ce5b5a
42,discussion9,"  Metabolic Control of Neural Excitability and Metabolic Substrates as Novel Antiepileptic Drugs Manipulation of neurometabolism exerts broad action and mechanisms influencing neural excitability and seizures. For instance, the anti-seizure effects of the KD may involve activation of adenosine receptors (Kawamura et al., 2010, 2016) and KATP (Ma et al., 2007; Lutas and Yellen, 2013), production of ketone bodies that inhibit transmitter release  or alteration of mitochondrial activity . Glycolytic inhibition with 2-DG not only blocks acute epileptiform activity in brain slices and animal models (Stafstrom et al., 2009; Forte et al., 2016; Shao and Stafstrom, 2017), but also interrupts the chronic process of epileptogenesis (Garriga-Canut et al., 2006; Stafstrom et al., 2009). Other metabolic interventions include disruption of the glial-neuronal energy coupling by targeting the so-called “astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle” (Belanger et al.",7e81b923-38f2-47af-ae4e-e6507e453f16
43,discussion10,", 2011) which also effectively blocks seizure activity . The efficacy of anticonvulsant activity of F1,6BP first reported by Stringer and colleagues and Lian et al. (2007) was quite remarkable in that it not only blocked seizures in all three animal models tested (KA, pilocarpine, PTZ), but also exceeded the treatment efficacy of 2-DG, valproic acid and KD. Therefore, F1,6BP appears to be a promising antiepileptic agent. The present study reveals an unexpected extracellular effect of F1,6BP, effectively blocking seizures by attenuating ICa without disrupting normal physiological function (neuronal firing and excitatory synaptic transmission), which is desirable for clinical anti-seizure treatment. Moreover, its neuroprotective effect against hypoxic-ischemic injury would be additionally beneficial to patients, as seizures are often accompanied by or caused by hypoxic-ischemic injury, particularly in neonates (Kang and Kadam, 2015).",304b1ef2-1cf1-4451-8123-5b1498b475bb
44,discussion11," Also, it is important to note that as a natural intracellular glucose metabolite, F1,6BP exerts very little toxicity even at a dose eight times larger than its effective dose . All these features of F1,6BP makes it an attractive candidate for an effective and safe antiepileptic agent.  In summary, metabolic interventions represent a novel strategy for treatment of drug-refractory seizures. We have identified a novel mechanism of the promising metabolic anticonvulsant, F1,6BP, which may provide new insight into its anti-seizure and/or neuroprotective activity.
