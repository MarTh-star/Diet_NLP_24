0,methods0," 4.1. Animals and Experimental Design  The study was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (approval date: November 28, 2018, n. 901/2018-PR) according to European Union guidelines (Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments). The animals were housed at the animal facility of the National Institute of Gastroenterology “S. De Bellis” Research Hospital, Castellana Grotte, Bari, Italy. All the applied procedures followed the International Guidelines for the use of laboratory animals, minimizing animal suffering.  The animal model chosen is newborn Wistar rats subjected to stress through maternal separation (MS) to induce Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) in adulthood [27]. Stress was due to removing the puppies from the mother for 3 h a day during the first two weeks of their life.",9f10efe0-6324-4254-8b88-d5d7a60708c8
1,methods1,"  The experimental design provided that, after weaning, the animals subjected to MS were further divided into two subgroups—one group fed a standard diet (Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)-St, n° 11 rats) and one group fed a low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet (Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)-KD, n° 17 rats). A control group of n° 12 animals without maternal separation and fed standard diet was also included (Table 1). Diets were supplied as pellets (4RF21 standard diet and KD purchased by Mucedola Srl, Settimo Milanese, Italy) and administered for ten weeks. After treatment, the animals were sacrificed by anesthetic overdose, and the entire intestinal tract was immediately removed and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The small intestine and colon were cut along the mesenteric insertion, placed on a paper strip at 0–4 °C and analyzed through a stereomicroscope at 3× magnification.",9b14d710-dcb1-429c-b293-96b46a5149c5
2,methods2," A part of the distal small intestine was immediately put into liquid nitrogen for real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)) and Western blotting analyses, and the remaining part was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h and embedded in paraffin in a “Swiss roll” fashion.  4.2. Histology  Tissue sections from the small intestine were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, dehydrated and paraffin-embedded. Three-micrometer-thick sections from the proximal, medial, and distal intestinal tracts were stained using a hematoxylin and eosin standard protocol. PAS staining on distal small intestine sections was performed to identify mucins. Observations and imaging were performed with a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY, USA)  4.3. Gene Expression Assay  RNA was extracted from distal intestine tissue using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",833ad6eb-0328-4a14-b3be-ac1373f697c8
3,methods3," Total RNA concentration was quantified with a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and purity estimated by 260/280 nm absorption. We reverse-transcribed 2 µg of RNA from each sample using the iScript Reverse Transcription Kit (Bio-Rad). The total cDNA was analyzed using real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)) for evaluation of CB1R, CB2R, PPAR-γ, GLUT1, E-cadherin, Occludin, Claudin-1, and β-actin on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Table 2 shows the gene-specific primer sets used (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The β-actin gene was chosen as the reference gene, and the DDCt method was used for relative quantification by CFX Manager software 2.1 (Bio-Rad Laboratories).  4.4.",7122ea0b-1622-4211-945b-69e1c1b4f98f
4,methods4," Western Blotting  Distal small intestine samples from control and treated rats were lysed with a buffer (Pierce Ripa buffer, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors to obtain protein extracts (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). The tissue samples were homogenized and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was measured by a standard Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy). Aliquots of 50 µg of total protein extract from each sample were denatured in 4× Laemmli sample buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol and loaded into 4–12% precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Milan; Italy) for Western blot analysis.",11d9d2f6-7592-43bf-98c1-d287f0e80942
5,methods5," After the blotting onto a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy), the proteins were probed with the following primary antibodies: CB1R (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), CB2R (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), PPAR-γ (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), GLUT1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), E-cadherin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), Occludin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), Claudin (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), COX-2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), IL6 (Immunological Science) and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA). After overnight incubation, the membranes were further incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit or mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy).",4535f9c2-5671-4549-b155-cf638130b0a1
6,methods6," The proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), and the densitometric analysis of each protein-related signal was obtained using the Molecular Imager ChemidocTM (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy) and normalized against β-actin expression.
