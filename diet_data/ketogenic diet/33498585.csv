0,discussion0," Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES)) is a rare disease in which refractory status epilepticus (severe epileptic syndrome) occurs in mostly previously healthy children and young adults following a febrile illness [1-3]. These seizures are very resistant to conventional AEDs and can be suppressed only with high-dose intravenous barbiturate administration [2-3]. Although some autoimmune inflammation is presumed as the pathomechanism of Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), conventional immunotherapies, including steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and PE, are usually disappointing [2-3]. Recently, several small studies have reported that KD could both reduce seizures and improve intellectual prognosis in Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES). These findings were mainly in children in the acute phase where continuous anticonvulsant infusion was required to suppress seizures [4-5].",31f80bef-b4ee-4115-91cf-8b6481be79b1
1,discussion1,"  Herein, we reported a young adult case with Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), who received KD in the chronic phase and long-term. Despite delayed KD initiation, he showed a great decrease in seizure frequency. However, the improvement in cognitive function was mild and insufficient.  The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and moderate protein content and has been used to treat children with refractory epilepsy since the 1920s, with a resurgence in the past two decades [6]. Putative mechanisms of KD include anti-inflammatory effects and neuroprotective properties in addition to anticonvulsant effects [7]. These various effects of KD may contribute to both seizure reduction and cognitive improvement in children with refractory epilepsies including Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) [4-5].",e58acd36-0276-40ec-a688-e95cafa64f8d
2,discussion2,"  Compared to children, the use of the KD in adolescents and adults has been more restrained due to reasons such as an inability to adhere to the diet or a medical team that is not proficient in administering the diet [8]. However, the emergence of more liberal regimens (e.g., the modified Atkin’s diet, the low-glycemic index treatment, and the medium-chain triglyceride diet) has allowed adolescents and adults to participate in diet therapies more tolerably, and these regimens may reduce seizures similar to classic KD with 4:1 ratio of fat to protein and carbohydrate [8]. Consequently, growing evidence indicates that the KD and its variants can be effective for adolescents and adults with refractory epilepsy as well as in children [8-11]. The seizure frequency of our patient was also sufficiently reduced on KD with lower ratios, such as 2:1 or 1.5:1, compared to the classic 4:1.",d9d024c5-b82d-4efc-8fa6-f3b29d137840
3,discussion3,"  KD should be initiated as early as possible in order to achieve and sustain seizure control, particularly status epileptics in the acute phase of Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), which can lead to deleterious cognitive outcomes [5,8]. Moreover, it has been reported that KD shows a better response in patients with recently increased seizure frequency than in patients with stable sporadic seizures [12]. However, our patient showed a great decrease in seizure frequency with mild cognitive improvement despite the initiation of KD in the chronic phase. Even in patients with chronic epilepsy resistant to multiple AEDs, KD should be fully considered to reduce seizure frequency and prevent further cognitive decline.  The appropriate duration of KD in refractory epilepsies, including Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), is controversial [8].",db50cc17-7c8b-40a6-a321-383d7c234db6
4,discussion4," The antiepileptic effect can persist in some children with refractory epilepsies, including Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), after its discontinuation [5,13]. In addition, stopping KD may lead to increased seizure frequency and recurrent SE in some adult patients [10]. We consider that the following points are important to successfully continue KD: the application of more liberal regimens, multidisciplinary teams with expertise in pediatric and adult neurology, epileptology, nutritional science, and cooperation of the family offering KD at home such as in our case.  Conclusions  We reported that a young adult patient with Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) showed a significant decrease in seizure frequency due to long-term KD despite initiation in the chronic stage, while his cognitive function incompletely improved.",5dbf99b1-e800-4fd2-9808-b946a5150a33
5,discussion5," Although early initiation of KD in Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is desirable to optimize both seizure control and cognitive outcome, we consider that KD can be applied for adult patients with chronic refractory epilepsy as well.
