0,introduction0,"The ketogenic diet (KD) has been utilized as a dietary therapy in clinical settings since the early 1920's and is well-documented in mitigating symptoms for a number of diseases, including epilepsy (Rho, 2015), autism spectrum disorder (autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Ruskin et al., 2013), and diabetes . Mechanistically, the KD functions to minimize carbohydrate availability and favor fatty acid oxidation. Ketone bodies, the by-product of this metabolic shift, are synthesized in the liver and ultimately consumed by major organ systems such as the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle as a major fuel source . Although the mechanisms of ketone body generation and utilization are well-understood, the tissue-specific impact of KD metabolism has yet to be examined.  Responsible for a host of metabolic processes including cellular bioenergetics and energy balance regulation, mitochondria represent the metabolic endpoint for dietary foodstuffs.",4f18aca2-9e71-45c2-90a2-b38ccd541e9c
1,introduction1," As the principal site of fatty acid metabolism through β-oxidation, assessment of mitochondrial function through oxidative phosphorylation (of mitochondrial function through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)) efficiency is a primary measure in KD interventions . However, the literature primarily focuses on the relationship between the KD and brain tissue (Veech, 2004; Masino and Rho, 2012; Milder and Patel, 2012), failing to examine the tissue responsible for ketogenesis—the liver.  In addition to their role in metabolism, mitochondria are known to exist as dynamic organelles. The study of mitochondrial dynamics refers to a group of specialized processes governing mitochondrial morphology, biogenesis, movement, and quality control . Mitochondrial morphology can be divided into two aspects: fission (fragmentation) and fusion (elongation).",a4f980ee-1f69-4c59-ae56-727dfe8a590f
2,introduction2," Many proteins and pathways are implicated in mitochondrial fission and fusion although the main regulators of fission are the proteins; dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), mitochondrial fission 1 protein (FIS1), mitochondrial fission factor (mitochondrial fission factor (MFF)) and mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kDa (MiD49/51), whereas fusion is primarily regulated by the proteins; mitofusin 1 & 2 (MFN1, MFN2) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1; Okamoto and Shaw, 2005; Chan, 2006; Detmer and Chan, 2007; Losón et al., 2013; Hoppins, 2014). Recently, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α) has emerged as a potential upstream regulator of fission and fusion machinery. PGC-1α governs mitochondrial biogenesis  and acts by regulating mitochondrial protein translation in response to energy balance fluctuations. Furthermore, variations in nutrient availability can also trigger mitochondrial movement within the cell .",8115b222-d760-445a-9266-bfc85e5586a5
3,introduction3,"  Another important aspect of mitochondrial dynamics is quality control. Termed mitophagy, this mechanism is responsible for the selective lysosome-dependent autophagy of mitochondria (Zhang, 2013). Through the breakdown of dysfunctional mitochondria, mitophagy helps to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis within the cell (Youle and Narendra, 2011). Mitophagy inducing receptors are present on the outer mitochondrial membrane and facilitate lysosomal degradation of mitochondria by localizing microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 to the outer mitochondrial membrane . A common mitophagy regulator is BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kd-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3; Ney, 2015). Once triggered, BNIP3 migrates to the outer mitochondrial membrane and is responsible for inducing mitophagy under conditions of cell stress, including hypoxia  and fasting .",ef456581-e9cc-46af-b40e-a1375cb72222
4,introduction4," Interestingly, the KD acts by metabolically mimicking the fasted state and mitophagy regulation has yet to be examined following this therapy.  To this end, we examined the impact of the KD on mitochondrial dynamics in the liver and brain (prefrontal cortex) using two mouse genotypes, the C57Bl/6 (B6) and the BTBRT+tf/j (BTBR). The BTBR mouse was chosen as it has been widely utilized as a model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)  and insulin resistance , as well as exhibiting behavioral alterations . Moreover, the KD has recently been shown to alter the metabolome and microbiome of BTBR animals, which are strongly correlated with host metabolic function . We hypothesized that the metabolic shift initiated by the KD would involve alterations in the expression of proteins governing mitochondrial dynamics in both the liver and brain.

25,discussion1," The major findings of this study are as follows: (1) KD feeding results in unremarkable changes to mitochondrial function or mitochondrial dynamics in the brain; (2) KD consumption spurs alterations in mitochondrial function in liver tissue; (3) the KD significantly changes gene and protein expression for regulators of mitochondrial morphology, abundance, and biogenesis in the liver; (4) the KD results in elevated gene and protein expression of the mitophagy regulator BNIP3.  Responsible for β-oxidation of fatty acids, liver mitochondrial function is crucial to healthy energy balance, and a pivotal site of metabolism when consuming a KD. However, the vast majority of existing literature on the KD has focused on the brain due to its well-documented neurologic benefits (Veech, 2004; Masino and Rho, 2012; Milder and Patel, 2012). Both liver and brain tissues were therefore assayed for mitochondrial respiratory rates, although technical issues enabled data acquisition for only liver.",ca1bcce4-1f7d-441a-9c74-5e525100f3bf
26,discussion2," In order to focus on fatty acid metabolism involvement, respiratory substrates succinate, and rotenone were used. This allowed us to analyze mitochondrial bioenergetics of Complex II . Although a limitation of the present work is the constraint in tissue availability, future research also warrants respiration data for Complex I substrates. Potentially leading to differences in mitochondrial function, examination of mitochondrial of mitochondrial function through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein levels was performed. Although brain tissue showed no differences, the liver of KD fed mice from both genotypes demonstrated lower Complex II and Complex III mitochondrial protein expression (Figure 2A). This reduction in KD animals is likely due to hepatic fat accumulation, inefficient mitochondrial bioenergetics, and insulin resistance. However, the effects on mitochondrial respiration were only observed in B6 and not BTBR animals.",45ef10af-e365-492c-8f1c-df5c83e88b44
27,discussion3," This is likely a result of “two hits,” or simultaneous metabolic insults in the BTBR model. Originally studied as a model of insulin resistance , the BTBR mouse demonstrates a tempered metabolic disturbance to the KD diet rich in fatty acids compared to B6 mice. In its early stages, insulin resistance results in augmented mitochondrial bioenergetics and enzyme activity—but the continued insult having the opposite effect and eventually led to impaired mitochondrial function and dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics in the liver . Therefore, there were likely early mitochondrial adaptations in the BTBR mouse stemming from a pre-disposition to insulin resistance and as a result, the impact of the KD on mitochondrial respiration was less pronounced.  Through mimicking the fasted state, the KD induces ketogenesis in the liver, with the resultant ketone bodies being metabolized by the brain.",c1d43b2d-2a4b-4726-ac03-2e09b33375ef
28,discussion4," As such, a unique relationship between liver and brain metabolism exists during KD treatment. We hypothesized that this shift in nutrient availability would impact mitochondrial dynamics. Thus, we examined differences in gene and protein expression in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology. Existing research supports the notion that fission gene expression is upregulated with nutrient availability  and fusion genes are upregulated with nutrient deficiency . Contrary to this, the present liver and brain data suggest a global upregulation of fission and fusion genes when fed the KD. These findings may be linked to tissue-specific metabolic fluctuations resulting from the stress of excess liver β-oxidation and brain ketone body metabolism with the KD. However, examination of protein expression suggests no changes in brain and a global downregulation in the liver following KD feeding.",678917d1-b7cd-49ed-9f56-a8d672983571
29,discussion5," This indicates a tissue specific sensitivity to changes in sources of energy. The differences between gene and protein in brain are likely due to the tight regulation of energy production, in order to maintain normal brain function . However, gene and protein differences in liver allow for rapid metabolic adaptations should carbohydrates become available. Unfortunately, literature examining the role of the KD to impact mitochondrial dynamics is limited. Interestingly, existing work using co-cultured cells with ketone body supplementation in the growth medium  and mtDNA deletor mice consuming a KD for over 30 weeks (Ahola-Erkkila et al., 2010), have demonstrated positive effects of the KD on host mitochondrial function. However, stark differences in duration of diet and type of model organism make it difficult to compare those results to the present findings.",5a2caab7-1aa3-425a-95bd-ea432565a1ea
30,discussion6,"  One explanation for the disparity between gene expression and protein levels is increased turnover of mitochondria via mitophagy. Although microscopic evidence of differences in mitochondrial mass and morphology are the current gold-standard, tissues from this animal cohort were not prepared at the time of sacrifice. Therefore, we first surveyed for differences in mitochondrial abundance by comparing the ratio of mtDNA/nDNA, which assesses the relative copy number abundance and therefore infers the amount of mitochondria present in a sample. No differences were detected in the brain; conversely, the mtDNA/nDNA copy number was decreased in the liver of KD mice, irrespective of genotype. In order to confirm these findings, we then investigated gene and protein expression for VDAC1—a commonly studied protein to assess mitochondrial abundance . Once again there were no notable differences in the brain.",2ce9b4a5-7839-4020-8a0e-193f2cd09d08
31,discussion7," In contrast, VDAC1 protein expression was decreased by the KD in liver. These findings explain, in part, the decreased Complex II and Complex III of mitochondrial function through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein levels in KD-fed liver tissue. Decreases in mitochondrial abundance caused by dysfunctional energy homeostasis have been linked to increased mitochondrial turnover (Youle and Narendra, 2011). This may indicate why the mitochondrial abundance in liver, whose energy balance is affected, declines while the mitochondrial abundance in brain remains unchanged.  In order to identify whether the KD impacts mitophagy signaling in liver or brain, we assessed levels of BNIP3—a primary mitophagy regulator. Not surprisingly, there were no differences in BNIP3 levels noted in the in brain; however, BNIP3 protein and gene expression were both elevated in liver of both genotypes after KD consumption.",9aa212e8-5cfa-40c7-9039-7d6db423326a
32,discussion8," These results suggest that upregulation of BNIP3-induced mitophagy in the liver may succeed the KD in order to sequester mitochondrial disturbances spurred by impairments in energy balance. Initially identified as exclusively pro-apoptotic, BNIP3-induced mitophagy actually lowers the cell's capacity to release cytochrome c and preserves cell viability . This provides a clear connection between the decreases in mtDNA/nDNA copy number and both VDAC1 and of mitochondrial function through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein expression in liver. However, as mitophagy involves a diverse number of proteins and other organelles, the complexities of this process must be further studied in response to the KD.  The KD has been shown to cause elevated PPARα—the transcription factor responsible for regulating fatty acid metabolism in the liver (Kimura et al.",ce6e598a-fe50-499f-b5b4-f3a3b6d0030d
33,discussion9,", 2013), and PGC-1α—a primary coactivator responsible for regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis (Liang and Ward, 2006). During conditions of energy deprivation, PPARα promotes the metabolic conversion of fatty acids to ketone bodies through upregulation of β-oxidation . Activation of PPARα facilitates the downstream upregulation of BNIP3, which is required to prevent excess lipid accumulation in liver tissue , culminating in increased mitophagy, and decreased mitochondrial abundance. As the upstream coactivator of PPARα, PGC-1α responds to physiologic and pathologic stimuli by regulating energy metabolism. Previous work examining the metabolic impact of the KD has shown that liver gene expression of PGC-1α is elevated in mice consuming a KD, although protein expression was not examined .",9ed1e0cf-d35b-4b79-9a3a-a750bf9975a9
34,discussion10," Liver tissues of KD mice in the present study also yield elevated gene expression of PGC-1α, although no changes in protein levels were found. Our data demonstrate that both B6 and BTBR mice respond to the KD by increasing gene and protein expression of mitophagy regulator BNIP3 in the liver. These findings are consistent with decreased mtDNA levels, decreased VDAC1 levels and the increases in PGC-1α gene expression. Increasing rates of mitophagy in the liver may also explain the discrepancy between gene and protein levels of the mitochondrial dynamics regulators investigated in the present study. As the metabolic pathways involving PGC-1α and PPARα are vastly complex, the specific roles of individual gene and protein alterations must be delineated accordingly.",1ddf6bd0-387b-453d-a249-98cfbd69e1f9
35,discussion11," This suggests that although PGC-1α is a primary upstream regulator of both PPARα and BNIP3, the mechanism of how the KD influences the regulation of BNIP3-induced mitophagy involves various gene and protein interactions, which in turn will require further studies into mitochondrial morphology and dynamics.  In summary, this study provides novel information about the relationship between the KD and two key tissues, the liver and brain. Our results show that the brain experiences no disturbances in mitochondrial dynamics, likely due to tight regulation of gene and protein expression. However, the liver withstands the burden of metabolizing the excess lipids consumed during the KD and experiences widespread changes in mitochondrial function and mitochondrial dynamics. This acts as a pathway to provide energy and to preserve brain function, which is supplied through ketone body production by the KD.",474e8afe-340a-4d74-807d-7a01809720ef
36,discussion12," Given the involvement of dysfunctional mitochondria in various disease states and the use of the KD as a clinical intervention, understanding how energy intake affects mitochondrial dynamics may lead to insights into how the KD exerts its broad-spectrum clinical benefits.
