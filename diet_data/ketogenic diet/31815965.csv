0,introduction0,"Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder in dogs with an estimated prevalence of 0.6–0.75% in first opinion practice (1, 2). Epilepsy in dogs has been associated with increased risk of premature and unexpected death, injuries, neurobehavioral, and cognitive dysfunction and reduced quality of life (3–5). Despite ongoing research in understanding the biological manifestations of seizures and epilepsy, the cellular pathologies remain elusive. Approaches toward therapy for dogs with epilepsy has been limited toward the control of seizures, most commonly chronic administration of anti-seizure drugs (ASDs), rather than prevention of epileptogenesis. Despite appropriate ASD treatment, often incorporating multiple drugs, approximately one third of dogs with idiopathic epilepsy (IE) continue to experience seizures that are difficult to control.",76fb466f-d29e-41b0-ba61-f292295897d5
1,introduction1," Furthermore, ASD-related side effects such as ataxia, sedation, polyphagia, polyuria and polydipsia in dogs contribute to reduction in quality of life (6). This emphasizes the importance of new treatment strategies to improve the welfare of dogs with epilepsy.  The use of dietary manipulations, such as ketogenic diets (KD) to prevent seizures in humans with epilepsy, was first introduced dating back to the 1920s, whereby the primary aim was to emulate biochemical changes associated with fasting (7, 8). Since then different dietary methods have consistently reported anticonvulsant properties to varying degrees in humans with epilepsy (9–12). It is thought that canine epilepsy is not only naturally occurring but also similar in pathology, heterogeneity, etiology, and clinical manifestations to its human counterpart and thus acts as a good translational model (13–15). In 2015, Law et al.",9e36e240-ebb1-4333-a808-313e0d316b4a
2,introduction2," reported the anti-seizure properties of a medium chain triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) ketogenic diet (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD) in a 6 month, placebo controlled crossover diet trial in dogs with IE (16). The medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD contained 5.5% medium chain triglycerides (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) and while containing 50% carbohydrate content, still resulted in a significant rise in blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations (16). The medium chain triglyceride (MCT)s included in the diet are able to induce ketosis more readily than long chain triglycerides (long chain triglycerides (LCT)) found in other dietary fats, therefore allowing for more carbohydrates and proteins within the diet, which in effect also increases diet palatability (17, 18).",63c2e6eb-0b13-4424-8a55-93a880aa6ab3
3,introduction3," There has been a consistent flow of scientific literature corroborating anti-seizure effects possessed by different ketogenic dietary methods, and as such, a progressive development of different hypotheses explaining the therapeutic mechanism of action (19, 20). Unfortunately, to date, the exact mechanisms of action remain unknown.  There has been increasing attention and evidence highlighting the importance of the gut microbiome in epilepsy (21, 22). In one human patient who had been experiencing seizures for 17 years, a fecal microbiota transplant (fecal microbiota transplant (FMT)), resulted in complete seizure freedom despite discontinuing ASD treatment during the 20-month follow-up period (23). In another study, six patients with drug resistant epilepsy achieved significant seizure frequency reduction, five experiencing complete seizure freedom, during antibiotic treatment (24).",c69a6230-69a8-4fdd-b1db-f9a54ac78565
4,introduction4," Interestingly, the patients were not all treated with the same antibiotics, hence reducing the likelihood that anti-seizure effects were drug interaction related but instead as an outcome of microbiota depletion. Peng et al., also showed that the microbiome composition correlated with drug responsiveness, where drug-resistant patients expressed increased abundance of rare flora whereas drug-sensitive patients expressed a microbiome composition similar to healthy controls (25).  The composition of the gut microbiome is influenced by environmental factors more so than by host genetics, where diet represents the predominate environmental factor influencing the makeup of the intestinal microbiome community (26). The influence of the gut microbiome has not only been highlighted in patients with epilepsy and seizures, but also in the anti-seizure efficacy of KDs (27). Olson et al.",897a5d76-c950-4065-99bf-28159da67f69
5,introduction5," found that a 6:1 fat:protein KD selectively enriched Akkermansia and Parabacteroides in mice, and the enrichment of those two bacteria genus alone was enough to confer seizure protection (27). This protective effect was transferable to other mice fed a normal diet by colonizing their gut with fecal microbiota from mice fed the KD.  Considering the potential that mechanisms by which KDs confer anti-seizure effects in dogs via influences to the gut microbiome, fecal samples obtained from a previously published diet trial by Law et al. have been used in this study (16). The 6-month, placebo-controlled cross-over dietary trial was designed to compare the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD with a standardized placebo diet in chronically ASD-treated dogs with idiopathic epilepsy (IE). Seizure frequency was shown to be significantly reduced when dogs were fed the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD when compared to the placebo diet (16).",a78e4a98-e93b-4e49-850c-6667cf9a818e
6,introduction6," Interestingly, the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD was also previously shown to confer significant behavior modifications in the dogs with IE (28). The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the gut microbiome and lipidome of dogs fed a medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD and make further comparisons between paired pre-trial and placebo-fed fecal profiles.

The owners of the dogs gave consent for their animals to be used in this study. The 6-month, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled, cross-over, medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD trial study for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy has previously been reported (16). The study population consisted of 21 dogs with a mean of 4.59 (SD 1.73) years of age and weighed a mean of 29.79 (SD 14.73) kg at the start of the trial (Supplementary Table 1).

Data Acquisition and Extraction 16S rRNA Sequencing DNA sequencing was performed using a 454 GS-FLX+ Genome Sequencer (Roche Diagnostics) as per manufacturer's protocols. DNA sequence data were generated and exported in the FASTA file format and subsequently processed and analyzed using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology [QIIME) v 1.9 (31)]. Raw DNA sequences were uploaded to NCBI Sequence Read Archive under the accession number SRP162687. The sequence data were de-multiplexed and quality filtered using the default settings for QIIME. Chimera detection and filtering was performed using USEARCH against the 97% clustered representative sequences from the Greengenes v 13.8 database (32). The remaining sequences were clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using an open reference approach in QIIME.,b9ff4569-b8d5-418e-8f79-ea308014eee2
14,methods7," Prior to downstream analysis, sequences assigned as chloroplast, mitochondria, and low abundance OTUs, containing <0.01% of the total reads in the dataset were removed. All samples were rarefied to 2,940 sequences per sample to account for unequal sequencing depth. The rarefaction depth was chosen based on the lowest read depth of samples. Alpha diversity was measured with the Chao1 (richness), Shannon diversity, and observed species metrics. Beta diversity was evaluated with the phylogeny based UniFrac distance metric and visualized using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) plots (33). Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was used to elucidate bacterial taxa that were associated with each diet trial (34). LEfSe was calculated using Calypso, a web-based software package that allows mining and visualizing of microbiome-host interactions (35).",2a80988d-e9be-477a-a443-b1b4bd964768

30,discussion0,"The primary aim of this study was to evaluate changes to the fecal microbiome and lipidome of dogs recruited on the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD trial (16). Intuitively, consumption of different diets are associated with corresponding differences in gut microbiome as shown in a number of biological models including humans, companion animals and research animals (21, 27, 38–40). As such, differentiating the changes in microbiome that are directly associated with the intended effect of diet, such as anti-seizure effect, to general diet related changes presents as one of the challenging aspects of diet-microbiome related research. Furthermore, interpretation of diet-microbiome related published literature must involve diligent consideration where significant changes to the diet itself inherently presents as a confounding factor to subsequent significant findings.",e8f3e184-6b88-4d50-93d1-bb86814a8b8c
31,discussion1," The medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD trial compares the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD to an isocaloric placebo diet, where the proportions of fats, proteins and carbohydrates remain identical with the acceptation that the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD contains 5.5% medium chain triglyceride (MCT)s and the placebo contains lard in replacement (16). The minimal difference in medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD and placebo diet components allows for evaluation of the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) effects on gut microbiome while minimizing the confounding factor of macronutrient perturbation effects on the gut microbiome. Furthermore, any aforementioned effects resulting from macronutrient changes can be evaluated when making comparisons to baseline profiles prior to commencement of the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD trial.",0920a249-a96f-4a7a-8c0b-334fb30ee63f
32,discussion2,"  Studies investigating the relationship between gut microbiome and disease states in dogs, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity and lymphoma, all show that decreases in alpha diversities within bacterial communities correlate with unfavorable disease outcomes when compared to healthy controls (41–44). Xie et al. showed that the Shannon alpha diversity index was higher in healthy infants when compared to infants with refractory epilepsy and that diversity was increased after a KD treatment period (45). Another human study investigating the relationship between KDs, epilepsy and gut microbiome showed that consumption of a KD when compared to baseline resulted in a reduction in alpha diversity, although this was reported as a trend which was not statistically significant (46). In one mice study, it was shown that consumption of a KD significantly reduced alpha diversity when compared to a control diet (27).",63467398-42b2-413a-bc37-715b643cc43a
33,discussion3," As discussed, comparing changes in the microbiome between different studies investigating the effects of diets requires careful consideration of the diets being investigated. In the aforementioned studies, the fat:non-fat ratios in the KD ranged from 4:1 in the human studies to 6:1 in the mice study, therefore representing a macronutrient dietary shift when compared to baseline (27, 45, 46). In this study, species richness (α-diversity) of bacterial communities showed a statistically significant increase during the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD when compared to the baseline, but no effect was observed on placebo diets. The results presented in this study better represents the micronutrient effects, as the test diets were formulated to have similar dietary compositions, and their composition was also similar to that of commercially available dry kibble diets consumed at baseline.",8cda1f79-cc92-45e9-a1a3-83c80f76f251
34,discussion4," Up to date, studies reporting the effects of KDs have shown both increases and decreases in alpha diversity within bacterial communities. More studies are required to elucidate and characterize the effects of different KDs on microbial diversities.  Using a mice model of refractory epilepsy Olson et al. showed that consumption of a KD not only elevated the seizure threshold but also selectively increased the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Parabacteroides (27). Furthermore, the anti-seizure protective effect of the KD-associated A. muciniphila and Parabacteroides was shown to be transferable to mice fed a non-KD (27). A.",6301ca5b-f1ab-4738-a084-37222e1d0106
35,discussion5," municiphila was not detected in this study and although Parabacteroides was absent in all dogs at baseline, it was later detected in one dog both during the consumption of the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD and placebo diet, and another dog only during consumption of the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD, a trend that did not reach significance (data not shown, p = 0.333). It has previously been shown that although microbial communities vary widely even among healthy individuals, the metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways remain stable (47). An unnamed Bacteroidaceae species within genus 5-7N15 was identified by LEFSe in this study as a potential biomarker associated with consumption of the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD. The same genus was also shown to be higher in abundance during the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD via univariate tests, however lost statistical significance upon multiple comparison correction.",099bb2bd-3732-411e-b1b6-ef0bb2da0f50
36,discussion6," 5-7N15, a genus from the Bacteroidaceae family (phylum Bacteroidetes), has previously been described in humans, sheep, cows and dogs (48–51). In humans 57N15 was found to positively correlate with genus Akkermansia, highlighting the potential that they might occupy a similar niche (51). Differences in the specific bacterial taxa detected may represent the biological and metabolic differences between canines and mice, especially when considering the likely differences in lipid metabolism between the two. Furthermore, the potential anti-seizure pathways affected by the specific bacterial taxa highlighted by Olson et al. may be represented by other bacterial taxa in canines (27).  In addition to reducing seizure frequency, the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD utilized in this study was previously reported to reduce the behavioral factors “chasing” and “stranger directed fear” (16, 28).",4f5dd358-5fb1-46f5-b935-93f6b6b2dfec
37,discussion7," Recently, it was shown that lineages of the Bacteroidacea family, including an unidentified species within genus 5-7N15, were increased in non-aggressive dogs (50). Other species within this family, such as Bacteroides fragilis, have also been shown to modulate mammalian behavior (52). Interestingly, although not statistically significant, there was a trend showing a reduction in the behavioral factors “stranger-directed aggression” and “owner-directed aggression” when dogs with IE were fed the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD utilized in this study (28). Increases of the unnamed Bacteroidaceae species within genus 5-7N15 during the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD period highlighted in this study may contribute to behavior modulating effects, such as reductions in aggression related behaviors. Besides the Bacteroidaceae family, Kirchoff et al. also showed that taxa within the class Fusobacteria and family Fusobacteriaceae to be more abundant in non-aggressive dogs (50).",cda7d45e-ab0a-4787-9e15-0ad6e89ddea5
38,discussion8," Interestingly, the results presented in this study also found an increased abundance of one unclassified genus within Fusobacteriaceae during the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD compared to baseline, with a similar trend in the placebo group. Taxa highlighted within the Bacteroidaceae and Fusobacteriaceae family may possess behavioral modulating effects.  On the other hand, higher levels of Fusobacterium, a large genus group within the Fusobacteriaceae family, has also been detected in other carnivore species (53–55) and dogs fed high protein diets (38, 40, 56). The Fusobacteriaceae family includes Fusobacterium varium, a bacterial species known to produce butyrate from protein sources, indicating that Fusobacteriaceae may be associated with protein digestion (57).",1aaf8ddf-0b38-4ccd-b4be-25b5311906b4
39,discussion9," Both the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD and placebo diet utilized in this study contained relatively high protein levels, and therefore the slight increase in Fusobacteriaceae observed in our data may be attributed to an increase in microbial communities linked to protein digestion.  An unclassified genus within the Erysipelotrichaceae family, instead, increased with the placebo diet and showed a trend toward increasing within medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD. Given the increase in abundance in both diets when compared to baseline, it is likely that this unclassified genus responded to changes in macronutrient composition rather than medium chain triglyceride (MCT).  Similar results were observed with other bacterial taxa. The abundance of both Megamonas sp. and Blautia sp. was reduced during both medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD and placebo diet. Genera Megamonas and Blautia are known short-chain fatty acid producers, fermenting carbohydrates into propionate (58).",1cf4b4eb-5418-4d4f-9440-c73dc2b5c8e0
40,discussion10," Unfortunately, the baseline diets in this study were not standardized, and the macronutrient composition was not the same for all dogs. Therefore, we cannot determine if the decreased abundance of these two species is due to a decrease in carbohydrate availability, or due to other factors. Genera Megamonas and Blautia are considered beneficial taxa, and their decrease has been observed in dogs with chronic enteropathies (59–61).  Although there were significant differences between some metabolite features detected by LC-MS, exact identification was not pursued because of the additional costs associated with conducting analyses for untargeted metabolomics. Furthermore, the data generated in this study originate from samples which were diluted during sample preparation protocols, explaining the low abundance of metabolite features detected by UPLC-MS. Despite this limitation some metabolite features were shown to be significantly different between diet groups.",3842cfcb-bbd2-4cc0-bb8e-0ab0ec5eeaf6
41,discussion11," Five metabolite features, tentatively identified as long chain triglycerides, were significantly higher after consumption of the placebo diet, which likely reflects the difference in fatty acid profile with the extra 5.5% lard present in the placebo diet. Furthermore, the 17 metabolic features which were significantly higher in abundance during both the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD and placebo diet phases when compared to the baseline diet phase likely represents metabolic constituents found within the test diets. Since we were unable to confidently identify the metabolic features that were significant, it is difficult to elucidate or infer further hypotheses. The recruitment criterion adopted by the diet trial study resulted in a pragmatic cohort population including different canine breeds.",47792ff9-dd25-4a1d-b293-a5a13d202244
42,discussion12," Although a crossover study design was adopted to capture perturbations in gut microbiota, authors acknowledge the potential that there may be variability in global gut microbiota reactions to the diets based on breed, which would not be captured in this study. More work is needed to interrogate the influence of ketogenic diets on the gut metabolome.  medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD, which is a promising treatment for drug-resistant idiopathic epilepsy in dogs, does not significantly affect the overall gut microbial communities. medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD did, however, increase bacterial richness, a finding commonly associated with successful treatment in other diseases. We were unable to identify Akkermansia in any of the fecal samples included in the study, which is a genus associated with successful KD treatment in humans and mice.",dad66cfd-f4db-4c0b-850e-bd69b9ca5013
43,discussion13," However, bacterial genus X57N15, which was determined to positively correlate with Akkermansia in humans, was found to be significantly increased in dogs receiving medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD, suggesting they occupy a similar niche. Parabacteroides, another genus associated with successful KD treatment in mice, was found only in two dogs, one during placebo and medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD, and another only during medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD. Interestingly, both dogs were negative for Parabacteroides before the trial. Furthermore, we previously reported behavioral changing effects that were associated with the medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-KD, and based on these data may manifest due to changes to the microbiome. More studies are required to elucidate further the influences of medium chain triglyceride (MCT)s on the microbiome and metabolome and the potential anti-seizure and behavioral modulating effects of specific microbial communities.",eb51e087-f2fc-44ed-9637-ed3f9012e5ef
