0,methods0,"Literature was searched up to January 2019 in PubMed, Embase and through cross‐referencing (Supporting Information 1). Studies describing clinical effects of dietary treatment for GLUT1DS were included and data from individual GLUT1DS patients with dietary treatment were aggregated as previously reported for rare diseases.5 To avoid duplicate reporting, the most representative of studies suspected to report overlapping patients was selected and data of identical patients described in different studies were combined. If data could not be related to individual cases, percentages were used for registration of (side) effects.  GLUT1DS was defined as presence of epilepsy, movement disorder, and/or cognitive impairment and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)‐to‐blood glucose ratio <0.50 and/or a SLC2A1 mutation.",775ea0a3-a712-4e47-9bda-fb4462919072
1,methods1,"  Effects were categorised as ‘deterioration’, including development of new symptoms; ‘no change’, only including patients with pre‐existing symptoms; ‘improvement’; or ‘disappearance of symptoms’. For statistical analyses, treatment response was categorised as ‘improvement’, combining improvement and disappearance of symptoms, and ‘disappearance’ of symptoms. ‘Cognitive improvement’ was defined as increased IQ ≥5 points and improved learning and school performances.  2.1 Statistical analyses To determine host and nutritional factors associated with treatment response, univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. The multivariable model included the possible confounding variables age at treatment initiation, CSF‐to‐blood glucose ratios, sex and, for epilepsy, diet composition. For movement disorders, diet composition could not be included in multivariable analysis due to uneven distribution of diets between patient groups.",e4a4fe83-a63b-4dcc-8435-eb8def0c70f7

Similarly, information and patient numbers were insufficient to analyse factors influencing treatment response for cognition and factors influencing deterioration of symptoms.

7,results8,"  Figure 2 Timing to dietary effect for epilepsy (n = 22), movement disorders (n = 18), and cognition (n = 22) in a Kaplan‐Meier curve  Side effects were explicitly evaluated in 173 of 270 patients; 81% reported absence of significant side effects, 6% gastrointestinal symptoms, 4% hypoglycaemia, and 4% weight loss or failure to thrive (Figure 1E). About 18% of 270 patients reported compliance problems.  Ten patients discontinued treatment due to absence of beneficial effects (n = 2), or compliance problems and side effects (n = 8). The effect of treatment discontinuation on epilepsy was reported for only five patients, and this led to deterioration in four of them. The effect of treatment discontinuation on movement disorders was reported in three patients and led to deterioration in two of them. For nine patients, symptoms strongly depended on compliance and degree of ketosis.  4 ",366c90fc-c275-4933-8aed-f14599433119
8,discussion0," Reviewing 25 years of experience with dietary treatment in 270 GLUT1DS patients, we discerned a strong positive effect on all GLUT1DS symptoms. Epilepsy improved in 83% and remained unchanged in 17%, movement disorders improved in 82% and remained unchanged in 17%, and cognition improved in 59% and remained unchanged in 40% of patients.  Most patients noticed treatment effects within days or weeks for epilepsy and after weeks or months for movement disorders and cognition. This information is important for expectation management and compliance. Early treatment initiation was favourable for treatment of epilepsy. Disease severity, as reflected by CSF‐to‐blood glucose ratio, affected treatment outcome for movement disorders, with most beneficial effects in less severe patients. This concurs with our experience that movement disorders are difficult to treat, but milder forms are more amenable to treatment.",bc5553f0-1f62-4db8-9f3a-a08088933882
9,discussion1," These findings might imply that dietary treatment is most effective in restoring the acute cerebral energy deficit causing epilepsy. The more protracted effect on movement disorders and cognition may reflect another pathophysiological mechanism.  Adherence to the strict KD remains difficult. Compliance problems were reported in 18%, and this might well represent an underestimation due to reporting and publication bias. The strong benefits of dietary treatment and the finding of higher efficacy upon treatment adherence in a previous review of GLUT1DS patients underscore the importance of compliance.6 Although diets with lower fat‐to‐carbohydrate ratios were effective in treating epilepsy in our study, higher fat‐to‐carbohydrate ratios were previously positively correlated with efficacy.6   Side effects were minimal, also when compared with KD treatment of epilepsy.3 This may relate to more heterogeneity and other organ involvement in epilepsy patients.",70ce553d-cf12-44d7-8976-cf2042a04811
10,discussion2," Alternatively, side effects may have been underestimated because they were reported for only 64% of patients. Reporting bias, duplicate patients and the relatively short follow‐up may have influenced our findings in general. Moreover, relating our results to the natural course of GLUT1DS is difficult, because dietary treatment has constituted the cornerstone of treatment since the first description.4 A long‐term follow‐up study of GLUT1DS patients (13%: dietary treatment; 47%: unknown) reported that movement disorders increased with age, cognition remained stable and epilepsy decreased during adolescence.10 Our results show that with treatment started at a mean age of 6 years, epilepsy decreased long before adolescence and movement disorders and cognition improved in most patients. Benefits of dietary treatment are further underscored by deterioration of symptoms upon poor compliance, low ketosis, or treatment discontinuation.",6e91e527-8f69-48ea-8089-92d36b77cfd5
11,discussion3," Moreover, positive effects of early treatment initiation in sibs illustrate the potential of dietary treatment in preventing progressive deterioration.2, 12 Despite these positive effects of dietary treatment for most patients, recently a retrospective study analysed seven patients with KD treatment failure.1 Compared with our patients and previously reported cohorts, this cohort of patients was characterised by a later onset of seizures (mean age: 43 months compared to 11.5 months in our cohort), and advanced age at diagnosis and initiation of dietary treatment. Treatment failure in these older patients at diagnosis correlates with the finding that younger age at diagnosis increased the probability of KD efficacy in the worldwide GLUT1DS registry (https://www.g1dregistry.org),6 and might imply that treatment should be initiated promptly to prevent irreversible damage.",edc29a47-4e22-4c72-999d-0371bb8784ac
12,discussion4,"  In conclusion, analysis of the reported 25‐year experience with dietary treatment for GLUT1DS reveals strong favourable effects on all symptoms and minimal side effects, underscoring the urgency to treat GLUT1DS with KD and adhere to the strict diet. We encourage early diagnosis or screening to start treatment promptly.  CONFLICT OF INTEREST M.
