0,introduction0,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children accounting for approximately 25% of all pediatric brain tumors [1]. Patients with medulloblastoma are treated with a combination of surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy [2]. Although these therapies result in 5-year survival rates of up to 70%, they are also associated with high morbidity. Furthermore, tumors recur in 40% of treated patients with more than 30% eventually dying from the disease [3–5]. The Hedgehog (HH) pathway subtype of MB presented the first opportunity for an intervention strategy based on a molecularly-targeted therapy in this pediatric brain tumor [6–8]. Proof-of-concept studies using a Smoothened (Smo) inhibitor, demonstrated that blocking HH pathway activity inhibits tumor cell proliferation and increases apoptosis in a MB mouse model, Ptch1 +/Trp53 -/-, resulting in eradication of even large spontaneous brain tumors [9].",fe01d526-3781-4632-938e-6df1877e6ad5
1,introduction1," These preclinical findings were followed by promising clinical results in MB patients in early clinical trials [10, 11]. However, enthusiasm for the use of this approach has been tempered by observations of the rapid acquisition of drug resistance in all MB patients who showed initial responses [12]. Thus, there is still a great need for additional, and perhaps combinatorial, therapeutic approaches for treatment of this disease.  Many decades ago, Otto Warburg suggested that cancer cells exhibit an increased capacity to utilize glucose and produce lactate even when an adequate supply of oxygen is present [13]. While incompletely understood, increased glycolysis in tumor cells may be important for production of non-essential amino acids such as serine [14]. In cancer cells, the majority of pyruvate is converted to lactate and glutamine is utilized for replenishing tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates [15].",d023e5f7-726d-4850-9b56-8316240ceda4
2,introduction2," In the brain, cells primarily metabolize glucose but they can switch to ketone use under low glucose conditions. The ketone bodies, acetoacetate and D-β-hydroxybutyrate, are produced in the liver via fatty acid oxidation, transported to extrahepatic tissues and taken up by cells where they enter the tricarboxylic cycle as acetyl-CoA. The brain uses ketone bodies at a rate that is directly proportional to their concentrations in arterial blood [16]. However, little is known about the utilization of ketones in brain tumor cells. Studies, carried out in mouse models, show that brain tumor growth can be reduced by placing mice on a calorie-restricted, low carbohydrate, high fat diet. Mice bearing malignant astrocytomas and orthotopically implanted human malignant gliomas exhibited reductions of 65% and 35% in tumor burden, respectively when fed a low carbohydrate, high fat diet [17].",c601eb72-d85f-4723-b66d-4707db1531f7
3,introduction3," Additionally, an orthotopic glioma mouse model showed prolonged survival after radiation treatment when maintained on a low carbohydrate, high fat diet [18]. These findings led to the proposal that a ketone-producing, low glucose diet hinders growth of brain tumor cells because they cannot efficiently use ketones when the supply of glucose is limited.  Several lines of evidence suggest that the HH subtype of MB may be particularly sensitive to the manipulation of tumor cell metabolism. The expression of key glycolytic enzymes is elevated in the NeuroD2-SmoA1 mouse medulloblastoma model [19] and activation of the HH pathway, by treating cultured adipocytes with an agonist of SMO, induces aerobic glycolysis via AmpK and pyruvate kinase regulation [20]. Loss of the HH pathway target hexokinase 2 results in disruption of cerebellar development and reduced tumor growth in the SmoA2 mouse medulloblastoma model [21].",de35a7ae-2d7e-482d-a6d6-67193220621d
4,introduction4," In addition, c-Myc, which is expressed in MB, has been shown to affect metabolism by transactivation of lactate dehydrogenase-A and suppression of microRNAs that augment mitochondrial glutaminase expression [22, 23]. Finally, insulin-like-growth factor-2 (insulin like growth factor (IGF)-2) is required for formation of HH-pathway tumors in mice [24], and it is increased in desmoplastic MB [25]. Here, we use a genetic mouse model of HH-MB, Ptch1 +/Trp53 -/-, to test the effect of a ketogenic diet on tumor growth. In addition, we investigate whether the diet can work in synergy with a SMO inhibitor to cause tumor regression. Since a low carbohydrate diet can decrease blood insulin level, we hypothesized that the diet may inhibit the PI3K pathway to slow down tumor growth.",248440cc-a7e2-4280-8555-7ad2105267e0
5,introduction5,"  Material and Methods Animals, General Housing Conditions, and Diet All animal housing, procedures, and euthanasia protocols were carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Adult mice were euthanized by decapitation with anesthesia. P7 mice were decapitated without anesthesia.  Genetically engineered mice that develop spontaneous MB (Ptch1 +/Trp53 -/) were generated as described previously [26] and maintained on a mixed C57Bl/6:129SV background.

NOD SCID mice were used for allograft transplantation of spontaneous MB from Ptch1 +/Trp53 -/- mice. A tumor-bearing cerebellum was resected, mechanically dissociated to near single-cell suspension, and mixed with Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD). Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and injected subcutaneously with cell suspensions in the flank. Flank tumor width, length, and depth were measured with a digital caliper (VWR). The formula for volume calculation was volume = π/6 x average (width, length, and depth)3.  Two irradiated ketogenic diets with different ratios of calories from fat and protein to calories from carbohydrates were used: 4:1 (Teklad, TD.96355) and 6:1 (Bio-Serv, S3666). The paste was contained in a 6 cm plastic petri dish and replaced daily.",9e7822eb-8d53-4202-a6d0-54ffa4ae6be1

Glucose, Ketone, and Insulin Measurements Glucose and ketone levels were measured from whole blood obtained by mandibular venous puncture carried out in the early evening between 4 to 6pm. The measurements were made with a Precision Xtra Ketone meter (Abbott) using test strips for glucose and ketones (Abbott) at day 0 and subsequently at days 2 and 7. Serum insulin was measured using the ultra-sensitive mouse insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Analysis of Spontaneous Tumor Volume MRI images were obtained with a Bruker 7 Tesla ClinScan animal scanner running the Siemens Syngo acquisition software.

Mice were anesthetized throughout the experiment by a gaseous mixture of isoflurane (1.5% to 2%) and oxygen. The respiration rate was continuously measured using the Small Animal Monitoring and Gating System (SA Instrument). After obtaining a series of localizers, contiguous image slices capturing the entire brain volume were obtained in the axial, sagittal and coronal directions using a turbo spin-echo sequence with a turbo factor of 7. Eighteen to 24 slices of 0.5 mm thickness were acquired interleaved with a FOV of 21 x 25 mm, an in plane resolution of 98 x 98 μm2 and with fat saturation. Other conditions were as follow: TR 3.650 s, TEeff 55 ms (echo spacing 13.7 ms), BW 130 Hz/pixel, refocusing flip angle 180°, 2 NEX. The time of acquisition was approximately 7 to 8 minutes.

21,results7," In both groups, tumors regressed to less than 30% of their original volume after 5 days of treatment regardless of the diet (n = 3,3; Fig 2F). No difference was observed in tumor regrowth in both groups after 2 days off therapy.  The Ketogenic Diet Decreases Insulin but Does Not Affect the PI3K Pathway Insulin levels were significantly reduced 2 days after initiation of the ketogenic diet. The average serum concentration was 1.64 ng/ml on the standard diet in comparison with 0.45 ng/ml on the ketogenic diet (n = 5,9; p = 0.003, Fig 3A). Insulin is a known regulator of PI3K pathway. Insulin and insulin-like growth factors activate PI3K which phosphorylates AKT [27]. Among the multiple functions of AKT is phosphorylation of forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factor family proteins in the nucleus. Phosphorylation displaces the FoxO transcription factors from target genes that promote apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest and trigger their relocalization to the cytoplasm [28].",a583fcca-cbd8-4774-ac31-48da9d648dfd

24,discussion0,"In this study, we tested the effect of a calorically-unrestricted ketogenic diet on the growth of HH-MB. Using both allograft and spontaneous MB mouse models we found that the ketogenic diet had no effect on tumor growth. Previous animal studies have shown that the ketogenic diet can reduce the growth of glioblastoma, gastric, pancreatic, lung, and prostate cancer xenografts [18, 29–32]. These results led to 12 clinical trials in which cancer patients are placed on a ketogenic diet [33]. In half of these cases the diet is used as adjunctive therapy together with chemotherapy or radiation for the treatment of glioblastoma. In many cases, patients seem to be adopting the diet themselves [34]. Therefore, it is important to test the efficacy of the diet in preclinical models of other tumor types, such as we have done in this study, before this strategy is adopted widely.",42cd434c-60e1-4254-ad2c-bb5accfc3676
25,discussion1,"  Consistent with other published studies, we found that serum ketone levels were significantly increased and glucose levels only mildly decreased in mice on the ketogenic diet [17, 35]. The ketogenic diet when used in conjunction with radiation has been shown to significantly reduce regrowth of orthotopic transplanted glioblastoma and flank lung tumors [18, 19]. There are only a few cases in which the ketogenic diet has been used in conjunction with drug-based therapies in mice. We did not find any effect of the diet on the rate of regression or regrowth of tumors following treatment with a SMO inhibitor.  Among the many metabolic changes induced by the ketogenic diet is the possible alteration of insulin levels. While a low carbohydrate diet does not consistently lower serum insulin and insulin-like growth factor (insulin like growth factor (IGF)) levels in tumor animal models [31, 36], in our mice we did see a significant reduction in insulin.",15216637-d6f5-4355-b90c-2b2cb69a0a54
26,discussion2," The mitogenic effect of insulin and insulin like growth factor (IGF) is due, in part, to activation of the PI3K pathway, one of several targets of metformin which is currently being investigated as an anti-cancer drug (reviewed in [37]). In a study of prostate cancer xenografts, the ketogenic diet was shown to cause lowered insulin and insulin like growth factor (IGF), decreased phosphorylation of AKT, and slowed tumor growth [38]. However, tumor cells harboring activating mutations in PI3K were found to be resistant to caloric restriction, despite the reduction in insulin and insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels [38]. In HH-MB, reduced insulin levels did not affect AKT phosphorylation or localization of Foxo3a [31]. Our findings suggest that insulin reduction by the ketogenic diet does not predict PI3K pathway inhibition.  The effect of a low or no carbohydrate diet on weight is variable depending on the protein and fat content as well as the caloric allowance [39, 40].",67ef3446-9224-48b2-96d1-71b72e995506
27,discussion3," In our study, NOD SCID mice with allograft tumors exhibited weight loss when placed on the ketogenic diet. However, this was not seen in the spontaneous tumor model. Ptch1 +/Trp53 -/- mice fed on the ketogenic diet maintained their body weight much longer than mice fed the standard diet. Previously, it was suggested that a low carbohydrate diet can preserve protein levels under energy restrictive conditions [41]. NOD SCID mice, even with large flank tumors, showed normal activity with no signs of stress throughout the course of the experiment. In contrast, Ptch1 +/Trp53 -/- mice with spontaneous tumors in the cerebellum may experience stress as the tumor grows which could result in energy restriction. In pancreatic and colon cancer mouse models, the ketogenic diet was protective against cachexia, a tumor-induced progressive atrophy of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle [30, 42, 43]. Our findings may provide further support that the diet may protect against cachexic weight loss.",4372d2ae-aca8-40d1-83d9-f4cb1650680f
28,discussion4,"  We show in this study that a low carbohydrate, high fat diet does not impact HH- MB growth or survival in our genetically engineered mouse model and flank tumor allografts. While ketones are increased and insulin is decreased, these changes in energy substrates and signaling molecules did not influence tumor growth. The alteration in diet and energy source also did not affect the efficacy of the SMO inhibitor. In conclusion, a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet does not cause a reduction in tumor growth of HH-MB and caution should be taken when its use is considered in human patients with HH-MB, even as adjunctive tumor treatment.
