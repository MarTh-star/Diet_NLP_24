0,introduction0,"Although declining cognitive function is common among older adults, across species, significant neuron loss is not observed in most areas of the brain, including the hippocampus (Rapp and Gallagher, 1996; Merrill et al., 2001; Mohammed and Santer, 2001; Rapp et al., 2002; Keuker et al., 2004; Pannese, 2011). While cell number in the hippocampus remains stable throughout the lifespan, relative to younger animals, aged primates and rodents show well-documented changes in synaptic structure and function within this brain region that relate to behavioral impairments (Barnes, 2003; Rosenzweig and Barnes, 2003; Pannese, 2011; Morrison and Baxter, 2012). These findings point to hippocampal synapses as key players in age-related cognitive deficits, suggesting that therapies designed to improve synaptic function in this structure could mitigate age-related behavioral decline.",ada5e52a-4f68-40ac-97c4-5a77c98d217b
1,introduction1,"  While the entire hippocampus undergoes alterations in synaptic structure, function and plasticity with advancing age, these changes are not uniform between the different subregions (for review, see Rosenzweig and Barnes, 2003; Burke and Barnes, 2006). Synaptophysin, a presynaptic marker, is significantly reduced in old compared to young rats in both CA3 and the dentate gyrus, but remains stable in aged CA1 . In the dentate gyrus, there is also a significant age-related decrease in synaptic number within the molecular layer  that correlates with impaired spatial memory . This reduction in dentate gyrus synapses is likely related to loss of perforant path fibers from the entorhinal cortex that terminate in the outer and middle molecular layers (Barnes and McNaughton, 1980; Foster et al., 1991; Yassa et al., 2010, 2011).",848c2847-b3c6-4f40-8a48-bbf9f6e4a1ef
2,introduction2," In the CA3 subregion, in addition to the loss of synapses in older animals, pyramidal cells show higher firing rates (Wilson, 2005; Thomé et al., 2016). Moreover, there is an increase in intrinsic excitability (Simkin et al., 2015; Villanueva-Castillo et al., 2017), and interneurons lose their phenotypic expression profiles (Cadacio et al., 2003; Spiegel et al., 2013; Koh et al., 2014; Thomé et al., 2016). Although the Schaffer collateral to CA1 pyramidal cell synapse does not exhibit an age-related decrease in total number , perforated synapses have reduced postsynaptic densities that correlate with cognitive impairment . These morphological data and the associated age-related decrease in the excitatory post-synaptic field potential that is evoked from Schaffer collateral stimulation (Landfield et al., 1986; Barnes et al.",2a5d77b7-e879-446b-85a8-054d3d823c7f
3,introduction3,", 1992) suggest that a portion of CA1 synapses may become non-functional or silent in advanced age (Rosenzweig and Barnes, 2003).  At the level of gene expression, there is also evidence that advanced age leads to alterations that are hippocampal subregion dependent. Overall gene expression profiles obtained from microarray analysis of individual hippocampal subregions show that while many genes are differentially regulated in old compared to young rats, a higher number of genes are altered with age in CA3 relative to CA1 and the dentate gyrus indicating that different cell signaling properties are uniquely vulnerable in old age between CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus . Moreover, age-related changes in gene expression in CA3 account for more variability in spatial memory performance .",e980939a-b0f7-465e-a769-d0c5fb26d569
4,introduction4," Another study using next-generation RNA sequencing, however, identified the dentate as the subregion with the greatest number of age-related changes in gene expression . While CA1 appears to have fewer age-associated changes in synaptic function and gene expression relative to the other subregions, there is evidence that metabolism and plasticity-related gene expression in this subregion is altered between young and older rats, and that these changes correlate with impaired cognitive performance .  The importance of synaptic activity for behavior is highlighted by the brain’s disproportionate use of metabolic resources for this process. A wide body of literature supports age-related impairments in metabolism within the hippocampus (Gage et al., 1984; Rasgon et al., 2005; Goyal et al., 2017; Hernandez et al., 2018b). Because synaptic transmission is so metabolically costly (Attwell and Laughlin, 2001; Howarth et al.",c2604a21-7685-4e0d-8de2-4d4b07258c06
5,introduction5,", 2012), it is possible that age-related impairments in cerebral glucose metabolism contribute to age-related synaptic dysfunction. Although cerebral glucose metabolism declines with age, the ability to utilize ketone bodies for energy production does not (Lying-Tunell et al., 1981; Ogawa et al., 1996; Castellano et al., 2015; Cunnane et al., 2016). Therefore, the potential to bypass impaired glycolysis through the elevation of ketone body synthesis and promotion of fat oxidation may alter the expression of hippocampal synaptic signaling-related genes (Hernandez et al., 2018b) to ultimately improve cognitive function (Hernandez et al., 2018a).  Ketogenic diets are high in fat and low in carbohydrates, switching the body’s primary fuel source from glucose to ketone bodies. Ketogenic diets have been utilized to alter neuronal signaling patterns in patients with epilepsy for almost a century .",35fbf5de-7f95-4ea2-ba11-410ebdc24ff6
6,introduction6," More recent evidence indicates that it can alter both excitatory and inhibitory signaling-related proteins within young and aged brains (Hernandez et al., 2018a, b). These alterations in protein expression have been shown to be both age- and brain region-specific, with more pronounced effects in the hippocampus than the prefrontal cortex. Quantification of proteins, however, does not easily afford the ability to delineate between hippocampal subregions, as is possible by examining gene expression at the level of RNA. This distinction is critical as previous work has suggested that ketone bodies may differentially affect the CA1 and dentate gyrus subregions. Specifically, the addition of medium chain triglyceride oil to rodent chow, which moderately increases ketone body levels in aged rats, was reported to increase the number of synaptic contacts and improve mitochondrial functioning within the dentate gyrus, but reduce synaptic contacts in CA1 .",00c87070-ccc5-4581-9bd2-14d062009dc0
7,introduction7," Relatedly, caloric restriction, which can induce fat oxidation and elevate ketone body levels, has also been shown to have a greater impact on gene expression in CA3 and the dentate gyrus compared to CA1 . Thus, there is a clear link between synaptic function, age and metabolism that differs across hippocampal subregions. However, the extent to which switching neurometabolism from glycolysis to fat oxidation impacts the expression of genes related to synaptic signaling has not been empirically examined in young and aged animals.  To investigate the role of a ketogenic dietary intervention on synaptic signaling-related gene expression within hippocampal subregions, young and aged rats were placed on an isocaloric ketogenic or control standard diet for 12 weeks. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic signaling-related gene expression was quantified within the dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1 regions of the hippocampus with RTq-PCR.",df4950e9-239c-4482-9d62-f2fa531b041c
8,introduction8," While there were no significant age- or diet-dependent changes within CA1, there were several age-related changes in gene expression within CA3 and several diet-related changes observed within the dentate gyrus. These data add to a growing body of work establishing the CA3 hippocampal subregion as being particularly vulnerable to dysfunction with age and provides new insights into how promoting fat oxidation over glycolysis leads to dissociable effects between the different hippocampal subregions. To investigate changes in synapse-related expression at the level of proteins, Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinases (ROCKs), which regulate the actin cytoskeleton at these synapses, was quantified within entire hippocampal homogenates from an additional set of rats on the same dietary regimen.",b6ba29d6-2346-47d1-991a-2735b11fbf03
9,introduction9," While aged rats on a standard diet demonstrated significantly elevated ROCK2 levels, which may be indicative of excitatory synapse loss, aged rats fed a ketogenic diet have levels comparable to that of young rats.  ",512ff9dc-53a5-40a3-9889-c52f4f188cf5
10,methods0,"Subjects and Handling Young (4 months; n = 15) and aged (20 months: n = 16) male Fischer 344 × Brown Norway F1 Hybrid rats from the NIA colony at Charles River were used for the current study. One week after arrival to the colony, 7–8 rats per age group were placed on either the ketogenic or standard diet. Rats were housed individually and maintained on a 12-h reverse light/dark cycle. Feeding and all data collection, including tissue harvesting, were conducted during the rats’ dark cycle. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of Florida.

Rats were weighed daily and fed equivalent calories (∼51 kcal/day) at the same time each day for 12 weeks. When rats are meal-fed consistently, ≥90% of their food is consumed within 3 h (unpublished observations). This caloric quantity, when fed once daily, is sufficient for healthy weight maintenance on both a KD and SD (Hernandez et al., 2018b), and the young rats in this study gained weight consuming this amount of kcal, though aged, obese animals lost weight (Supplementary Figure S1). In fact, young animals raised on this diet for greater than 1 year continue to gain weight as they age (unpublished data).",ba47ed52-2fb8-4b13-8b9a-c78ea22132c9
12,methods2," Importantly, since all age and diet groups were calorically matched, energy intake could not account for group differences in the data. Access to water was ad libitum and all groups consumed comparable amounts of water (Hernandez et al., 2018b).  Confirmation of Nutritional Ketosis To confirm rats were in nutritional ketosis, blood glucose and ketone body (β-hydroxybutyrate; BHB) levels were quantified on the day of sacrifice and tissue collection. For each measurement, one drop of blood was taken directly from the trunk immediately following decapitation for each test. Blood was collected directly onto the appropriate test strip (Abbott Diabetes Care, Inc., Alameda, CA; glucose SKU#: 9972865 and ketone SKU#: 7074565), which was placed into a Precision Xtra blood monitoring system (Abbott Diabetes Care Inc., Alameda, CA; SKU#: 9881465).

Animals lost righting reflex within 30 s of being placed within the jar and were then immediately euthanized by rapid decapitation. Left and right hippocampi were dissected away from surrounding tissues on an ice-cold plate. The left hippocampus was frozen on dry ice and the right hippocampus was sub-dissected into dentate gyrus (DG; including the hilus), CA3 (including CA2) and CA1 regions from 1 mm-thick transverse sections made through the entire septal–temporal axis using a tissue chopper. Each slice was transferred to a chilled, back-lit glass stage and viewed through a dissecting scope to enable the visualization of cellular layers within the hippocampus. Dissecting filaments were used to separate the CA1 subregion from dentate gyrus at the hippocampal fissure.",78220ea1-9016-4d7b-bcae-5369a64b328e
14,methods4," The boundary between CA3 and CA1 was demarcated by the transition from the thicker, more diffuse pyramidal cell layer of the CA3 to the thinner, more densely packed pyramidal cell layer of the CA1. The CA3 was separated from DG and hilus by a cut that extended between the distal edges of the superior and inferior blades of the DG, which were readily visualized as densely packed layers of granule neurons. Subregions were pooled across slices, frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until prepared for molecular and biochemical analyses.

18,methods8," After normalization with RPLP1 and transformation using the 2(–ΔCt) method, values were standardized and expressed as z-scores. Two-factor ANOVAs (age × diet) were used to compare expression of gene transcripts between group samples in DG, CA3 and CA1 separately using the Benjamini–Hochberg method to correct for multiple comparisons with a false discovery rate (FDR) of q = 0.005 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Storey and Tibshirani, 2003).  Gene Functional Enrichment Analysis The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, v6.8) was used to determine any significantly enriched pathways associated with genes that met the false discovery rate (FDR) criteria (Huang et al., 2009a, b). Specifically, DAVID enabled the identification of the most robustly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)) pathway per gene set.",009c0ff4-a524-4a0f-804a-25d9d4fee3fb
19,methods9," To simplify downstream analyses and interpretations, only the top false discovery rate (FDR)-ranked pathways per gene list were considered. Significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were validated using a second enrichment analysis tool such as Enrichr (Chen et al., 2013; Kuleshov et al., 2016; Cowley et al., 2018).  Evaluation of ROCK Protein Levels Whole hippocampal homogenates were used from 5 of these rats per age and diet group (n = 20 rats total) to quantify protein levels.

32,results9,"  Finally, within CA1, there were no significant effects of age or diet on gene transcript levels, nor were there any significant age × diet interactions after adjusting for a false discovery rate (FDR) of q = 0.005 (two-factor, age × diet ANOVA: F-values[1,18–20] = 0.000–8.629, ps(false discovery rate (FDR)–adjusted) > 0.005). Supplementary Table S7 contains descriptive statistics and Supplementary Table S8 contains a statistical summary for all genes in CA1.  The Ketogenic Diet Restores Age-Related Increases in Hippocampal ROCK2 Expression The reduction in gene transcripts associated with glutamatergic signaling in the DG suggests that long-term nutritional ketosis could decrease excitatory synaptic transmission.",f9e953e7-1309-4018-9c2e-3b9edb7dd1a4
33,results10," Previous work examining protein levels of the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 in whole hippocampal homogenates, however, showed that the KD remediated age-related loss of this essential synaptic protein without otherwise influencing expression in young rats (Hernandez et al., 2018b). This previous work suggests that there is not an overall loss of excitatory synapses within the hippocampus following the KD, and that there may even be a restoration of synapse number in aged rats. In the hippocampus, most excitatory synapses are on dendritic spines (McKinney, 2010). Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinases (ROCKs) regulate the actin cytoskeleton at these synapses, and inhibition of these molecules increases spine density . These data suggest that elevated ROCK levels in the hippocampus could potentially be related to excitatory synapse loss.",6081f514-9ae4-4870-959c-5bc3aa24f112
34,results11," Furthermore, inhibition of ROCK improves spatial working memory in aged rats suggesting that decreasing ROCK may be beneficial for the treatment of cognitive aging or neurodegenerative disorders resulting in dendritic spine alterations . Therefore, ROCK2 protein levels within the soluble fraction of hippocampal homogenates were quantified via Western Blotting. Within the hippocampus, there was a significant age-dependent increase in ROCK2 expression in aged rats on the SD relative to young animals on the SD (F[1,7] = 11.61; p = 0.01; Figure 7). Because of the main effect of age across SD-fed subjects, the possibility that a KD could restore these levels was explored using a multivariate ANOVA. While there were no main effects of either age (F[1,15] = 2.21; p = 0.16) or diet (F[1,15] = 4.36; p = 0.054), there was a significant interaction between age and diet (F[1,15] = 11.74; p = 0.004).",564a0f66-e3db-4016-9a90-c9a3c4e6faff
35,results12," Furthermore, when young and aged rats on KD were directly compared, there was no longer an effect of age (F[1,8] = 1.97; p = 0.20). These data show that the KD was able to reduce levels of ROCK2 in the hippocampus of aged animals to levels comparable to those observed in young rats. This observation provides indirect evidence that the KD does not lead to an overall reduction of excitatory synapse number. Thus, the diet related changes within the dentate gyrus are likely due to altered regulation of glutamatergic synapses without a reduction in excitatory synapses. Functional assessment of hippocampal neurophysiology will be necessary to determine the impact of long-term nutritional ketosis on the aged hippocampus.

37,discussion0,"The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of age and diet on glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling-related gene expression from cell body-enriched tissue samples across subregions of the hippocampus. There was a significant reduction in transcript levels of several genes associated with pre- and post-synaptic signaling mechanisms within the dentate gyrus (DG) of ketogenic diet (KD)-fed rats relative to standard diet (SD)-fed rats irrespective of age. Notably, several gene targets reduced as a function of diet in the DG were also reduced in CA3 of aged rats relative to young rats irrespective of diet. Consistent with previous work, there were no effects of age on transcript levels detected within CA1 (Haberman et al., 2011; Tran et al., 2018; but see Zeier et al., 2011). The current findings build on this to show that CA1 synapse-related transcript levels were also not significantly altered by long-term dietary ketosis.",e61393a0-7ec1-47f2-a236-4752fedfbffd
38,discussion1," Interestingly, a pathway enrichment analysis highlighted the age-related vulnerability of CA3 glutamatergic synapses in addition to a potential diet-dependent compensation within DG glutamatergic synapses (see Figure 8).  FIGURE 8 Model of gene contributions to significant ionotropic glutamate receptor (glutamatergic synapse; Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)) pathway enrichment as determined by DAVID for (A) inputs to the DG, (B) projections from DG to CA3, and (C) projections from CA3 to CA1. Significant reductions in receptors/genes by diet (red) and age (blue) are indicated by color.  Reduction of Gene Transcript Levels by Ketogenic Diet Is Specific to Dentate Gyrus Although the DG receives input from several cortical and subcortical regions, its primary excitatory input is from the perforant pathway emanating from layer II neurons of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices and synapsing in the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer (Witter and Amaral, 2004).",fc2382d6-33f3-422a-b714-b3f5f8adc41a
39,discussion2," The inner molecular layer receives commissural and other non-entorhinal cortical inputs, including inhibitory basket cell projections . The tissue isolated for quantitative RNA analysis in the current study, however, primarily consisted of DG neuron cell bodies with a smaller contribution from hilar and non-neuronal cells. Thus, changes in gene expression largely reflect alterations within the DG granule cells densely packed into the principal cell layer, but may also be influenced to some extent by glutamatergic mossy cells . Moreover, changes in synapse-related gene transcripts cannot be localized to a specific input layer of the dendritic field that will have variable distributions of inhibitory, excitatory and neuromodulatory input.",d3c049eb-5d18-4e2c-a1b8-b9f49122e79c
40,discussion3," That being said, transcript reductions in animals on the KD point to potential alterations in granule cell dendritic input (post-synaptic signaling), as well as altered granule cell axonal output from the mossy fibers (presynaptic transmission). Therefore, a pathway enrichment analysis was used to facilitate modeling the most reliable changes to DG dendritic input and DG axonal transmission. According to DAVID’s functional pathway enrichment analyses, the glutamatergic synapse pathway was the most reliably enriched. However, it should be noted that entire hippocampal subregions were utilized, and the influence of neuron subtype could not be delineated.  Of the 40 genes significantly affected by the KD in the DG, 21 genes contributed to this pathway enrichment. Among these genes, 13 had primarily postsynaptic functions (see Figure 8A), and therefore reflect changes on dendrites receiving input from perforant path axons or other afferents.",f9513481-ae9f-4641-bb82-b05526055266
41,discussion4," Specifically, a number of contributors to this pathway enrichment included gene transcripts of postsynaptic proteins integral to neuronal excitability (e.g., ionotropic glutamate receptors), synaptic plasticity (e.g., scaffolding proteins), and second messenger signaling cascades (e.g., metabotropic glutamate receptors and downstream effectors). Together these data suggest that a KD may reduce glutamatergic signaling in granule cell dendrites. This has interesting implications for both aging and epilepsy. In advanced age, the excitatory postsynaptic field potential for a given amplitude of the presynaptic perforant path fiber potential is larger relative to young animals (Barnes and McNaughton, 1980), suggesting that excitatory synapses in aged rats are more powerful.",ecc65ca8-82dd-4b5a-83a7-e6c01d202076
42,discussion5," Similarly, intracellular recording methods measuring unitary excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude in young and aged rats, show that the depolarization resulting from stimulation of a single fiber is increased in old compared to young granule cells . Thus, it is conceivable that nutritional ketosis may reverse this age-related increase in synaptic strength. Relatedly, the KD is known to be effective at reducing seizure activity (Lefevre and Aronson, 2000; Baranano and Hartman, 2008). Epileptiform activity in medial temporal lobe epilepsy is generated by dentate gyrus granule cells (Bumanglag and Sloviter, 2018). The ketogenic diet may reduce excitatory drive onto granule cells to reset the balance between excitation and inhibition thereby conferring seizure projection.",2f212518-f38b-4928-8847-4b4470905dc4
43,discussion6," Consistent with the current data showing that the DG is particularly sensitive to a KD, a previous study observed an increased number and size of mitochondria within the DG region of the hippocampus in KD-fed rats . In this study, the authors hypothesized that increasing the quantity of key metabolites involved in oxidative phosphorylation like glutamate and phosphocreatine can enhance ATP production to fuel pumps on the cell membrane. These changes could therefore stabilize the membrane potential and increase resistance to metabolic stress. Using a gene microarray approach, this study also reported an increase in the transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, which the authors concluded might confer anticonvulsant properties within the hippocampus .  The KD reduced transcript levels of 8 genes that contribute to pathway enrichment of presynaptic proteins integral to glutamate metabolism (e.g.",ccf91f39-28a0-4cc1-b2a5-743d6dcd3803
44,discussion7,", synthesis and packaging) and synaptic glutamate regulation (e.g., autoreceptors and transport) in DG. This observation has implications for how nutritional ketosis may alter mossy fiber axonal transmission to the stratum lucidum of CA3 (see Figure 8B). With age, there are neurophysiological alterations at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse that include reduced inhibition (Villanueva-Castillo et al., 2017). It is conceivable that when consuming a KD, altered presynaptic glutamate metabolism may decrease excitatory drive to CA3 to ameliorate age-related hyperexcitability (Wilson, 2005; Thomé et al., 2015), but this idea needs to be empirically tested with functional measurements.  While our previous work has shown the diet can restore hippocampal levels of the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1; Hernandez et al., 2018b), the level of transcript encoding vGluT1 (Slc17a7) in the DG was lower in KD-fed relative to SD-fed rats.",dc0c791a-846a-42bc-8c48-a7791f091489
45,discussion8," One possible explanation for the opposing directional changes between protein and transcript levels is that reduced vGluT1 protein was detected from whole-hippocampal homogenates and could have been driven by changes in other subregions. Another possible explanation reconciling contrasting changes between protein and transcript levels is that the KD increased the stability of vGlut1 protein, resulting in a reduced need for gene transcription. Indeed, reductions in levels of a gene transcript are not always translated to a loss of its protein product (Gygi et al., 1999; Greenbaum et al., 2003; Maier et al., 2009). Additional functional assessments of synaptic integrity will be necessary to differentiate between these contrasting possibilities. Importantly, our ROCK2 protein findings suggest a diet-induced increase in synaptic stability, and as such, KD-related reduced transcript levels in the DG may reflect synaptic stability and improved cognitive performance (Hernandez et al., 2018a).",3348d435-0129-4741-a6b8-1127af2ea71a
46,discussion9,"  Notably, the results presented here agree with a hippocampal cDNA microarray study on KD-fed rats showing diet-induced reductions in several genes associated with neuronal excitability that overlap with the current study . Although the null age effects in the DG are consistent with previous work showing CA3-specific changes in gene expression not observed in DG , it must be noted that the SD-fed rats in the current study were fed under a meal-feeding schedule. This feeding regimen may have improved peripheral metabolism relative to ad libitum eating . While rodent consumption was not reduced to levels comparable to caloric restriction studies, meal feeding prevented overconsumption of food relative to ab libitum consumption. Previous studies showing age-related changes in the DG were conducted in ad libitum fed rats (Ianov et al.",ee727efa-1aba-44fa-ae9b-900b5d2753cc
47,discussion10,", 2016), that may have been metabolically compromised due to excessive caloric intake . The DG is the subregion that is most vulnerable to glucose dysregulation. In fact, individuals with diabetes have reduced basal cerebral blood volume, an indirect measure of oxygen metabolism, in the DG compared to normal study participants. The magnitude of the decline is related to blood glucose levels. In contrast, basal cerebral blood volume in CA1 and CA3 is not affected by diabetes . It is likely that metabolic changes disproportionately affect the DG due to the high energy demands of adult neurogenesis (Beckervordersandforth, 2017). This cost is further driven by how densely packed the principal cell layer is and the sheer number of neurons within the DG .",3ec59a6f-e10f-438b-a737-ece738e4e902
48,discussion11,"  Reduction of Gene Expression With Advanced Age Is Specific to CA3 As the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus receives input from the DG, any functional changes within DG likely have direct downstream consequences on CA3. Similar to the DG, the RNA extracted from CA3 was from cell body-enriched samples, and therefore, transcript level changes observed within this subregion predict alterations in dendritic input primarily from DG (post-synaptic signaling) in addition to CA3 axonal output via Schafer collaterals projecting to CA1 (presynaptic transmission). Of the 24 genes that showed a significant reduction in transcript levels in aged compared to young rats, 12 of these genes contributed to glutamatergic synapse pathway enrichment. Specifically, four contribute to presynaptic glutamate regulation, four contribute to postsynaptic signaling transmission, and four contribute to synaptic plasticity (see Figure 8B). Age-related vulnerability of CA3 neurons is a well-documented phenomenon.",c4b70227-25a8-4974-bacc-4f152ed03ca2
49,discussion12," The data presented here are consistent with alterations in CA3 excitability observed in humans (Yassa et al., 2010, 2011), monkeys , and rats (Wilson, 2005; Robitsek et al., 2015; Maurer et al., 2017). Additionally, changes in gene expression specifically within CA3, and not DG, correlate with cognitive outcomes in aged rats .  Interestingly, there were no diet-induced changes in gene expression within CA3 that survived the false discovery rate threshold. Prior work has shown that in whole hippocampal homogenates nutritional ketosis leads to increased levels of protein for the vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT; Hernandez et al., 2018a, b). This led to the hypothesis that the KD’s effectiveness at preventing epileptiform activity , reducing anxiety-like behavior and improving cognitive function (Hernandez et al., 2018a) was through increasing synaptic levels of GABA.",b101ab64-eb7d-45fb-ba95-910eeafc0ed0
50,discussion13," Although the gene encoding vGaT (Slc32a1) was not quantified in the present study, diet-induced reductions in transcript levels of genes associated with glutamate synthesis, packaging, and synaptic clearance on presynaptic DG afferents (Figure 8B) suggest that the KD may reduce excitatory afferent drive to CA3, which could confer resilience in aging and epilepsy. This hypothesis needs to be tested with functional studies that directly measure the neurophysiological interactions between the DG and CA3. The complexity of age- and metabolism-related changes demonstrate the need for such studies and require a multifaceted approach beyond the scope of the excitatory and inhibitory gene panel used here.  Age-Related Decrease in Synaptic Stability Is Restored in Ketogenic Diet-Fed Aged Rats In addition to gene expression, whole hippocampal homogenates were used to investigate protein expression of rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2).",aa52f092-e742-4e0d-8d7c-db0dc1415f31
51,discussion14," ROCK2 is an essential regulator of cytoskeletal elements with the ability to modify dendritic spine stability and number, and this protein has been shown to accumulate in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (Bobo-Jiménez et al., 2017). Excessive ROCK proteins lead to dendritic spine instability, and inhibition of ROCKs restore microtubules at the dendrites, leading to improved dendritic arborization (Li et al., 2000; Nakayama et al., 2000; Chen and Firestein, 2007; Bobo-Jiménez et al., 2017). Furthermore, ROCK inhibition in aged subjects improves cognitive performance on the hippocampal-dependent Morris water maze . We found aged rats fed the SD had significantly increased levels of ROCK2, suggesting decreased stability in axospinous synapses within the hippocampus of aged subjects. Aged rats fed a KD, however, had ROCK2 levels similar to young rats on both diets, demonstrating a restored ability to appropriately regulate dendritic morphology.",160123ce-542e-4991-a3ac-97902648cf4c
52,discussion15," These data demonstrate a KD, in conjunction with meal-feeding, exerts changes in neuronal signaling at the levels of both gene and protein expression.  Conclusion Although there were no significant changes within CA1, there were alterations in genes encoding presynaptic proteins at CA3 Schafer collateral terminals synapsing onto CA1. Along these lines, the null diet effects on gene expression within CA3 does not mean that this subregion is functionally unaltered. Although the KD did not rescue an age-related decrease in CA3 transcript levels, the KD altered functionally related genes in the DG, which is upstream and sensitive to metabolic perturbations. Consequently, diet-induced decreases in DG transcript levels may be a compensatory mechanism leading to positive change that helps confer resilience in the face of age-related dysfunction in network dynamics between subregions of the hippocampus.",c6d5bf9f-5ccf-4a79-9bbf-ecb8f55d8dd5
53,discussion16," This hypothesis needs to be directly tested with in vivo approaches to measure DG-CA3 interactions in aging.  Our study also did not detect age-related calcium dyshomeostasis within CA1, as previously described (Campbell et al., 1996; Bodhinathan et al., 2010; Zeier et al., 2011; Oh et al., 2013). We did not see an increase in ITPR1 gene expression, which is translated into the IP3 receptor protein. Notably, however, the transciption of other genes encoding proteins related to calcium regulation that are known to be affected by age were not evaluated in this panel, including voltage-gated L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors (Thibault and Landfield, 1996). Alternatively, others have documented age-related shifts in intracellular signaling cascades and their propensity to recruit IP3 receptor-gated calcium pools despite preserved expression of constituent signaling proteins (e.g., Nicolle et al., 1999; Kumar and Foster, 2007, 2014; McQuail et al., 2013).",a886ea88-bc7f-4749-a9bb-373df78d6f02
54,discussion17,"  Finally, differences between this study and previous reports could be due to implementing meal-feeding and prevention of overeating, which improves peripheral metabolism (Golbidi et al., 2017; Manoogian and Panda, 2017; Anton et al., 2018), potentially altering neurometabolism in aged rats regardless of diet. The majority of studies utilizing aged rodents have provided access to food ad libitum throughout the lifespan, resulting in metabolically impaired subjects . Thus, free feeding may exacerbate cognitive and neurobiological deficits, increasing the probability of detecting age effects. In fact, it is well documented that excessive energy consumption can lead to cognitive impairments (Stranahan et al., 2008; Kanoski and Davidson, 2011; Bocarsly et al., 2015).",4ebfb66d-d4ce-4f4c-9c8a-ea2db3ab256d
55,discussion18," Therefore, it is imperative that investigations into the effects of cognitive interventions account for this often overlooked, yet vital component of animal maintenance through the implementation of proper feeding strategies, or at the very least consider rodent metabolic health as a variable in aging studies providing food ad libitum.
