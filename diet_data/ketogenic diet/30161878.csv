0,methods0,"2.1. Animals Two groups of seven male Wistar rats (Harlan Laboratories, Udine, Italy), aging 5 weeks, weighting 108 ± 13 g (mean ± S.D.), were used. They were housed in standard temperature and humidity conditions with a 12 h light–dark cycle (lights on from 07:00 to 19:00). Animals were fed with standard food ad libitum (control group) or with a calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) (calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD)-treated group) as previously described [18]. Briefly, the calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) was a food mix composed of more than 78% by fat (Bio-Serv cF3666, Frenchtown, NJ, USA) and was limited to approximately 90% of the calculated daily calorierequirement. Rats were fed with the above diets for ten weeks, then they were sacrificed by anesthetic overdose. All procedures fulfilled the requirements of the European Communities Council Directive of 22 September 2010 (2010/63EU).",6be6367b-b3ab-45ef-b759-205fa57cca4d
1,methods1," The research was approved by the local ethical committee of the University of Salerno and by the Ministry of Health of the Italian Government.  2.2. Histology After sacrifice, rats ware perfused with 4% formaldehyde/phosphate buffered saline (perfused with 4% formaldehyde/phosphate buffered saline (PBS)). Brains were immediately removed and stored in fixative, then equilibrated with 30% sucrose/perfused with 4% formaldehyde/phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for at least one week. Coronal sections (20 μm in thickness) were obtained with a cryostat at the level of the midbrain (6 mm posterior to bregma) and mounted on microscope slides (Super Frost Ultra Plus, Menzel, Germany). From each animal, twenty sections were taken and alternatively processed for myelin staining or for microvasculature marking by immunofluorescence.  For myelin staining, sections were first dehydrated by immersion in ethanol 70% (2 min), 90% (2 min), and 100% (4 min), then left in xylene for 60 min.",322afb10-2c13-4a4e-a588-30b8b161ce18
2,methods2," The sections were then rehydrated by immersion in ethanol 100% (4 min), 90% (2 min), 70% (2 min), and water (2 min). This treatment was necessary for Erichrome staining of myelin. Myelin staining was obtained by immersion in an Eriochrome solution (20 min), consisting of Eriochrome Cyanine R (CI 43,820, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) 0.1 g/100 mL + FeCl3 0.224 g/100 mL + sulfuric acid 0.5 mL/100 mL. Subsequent steps were: washing with water; immersion in a fresh FeCl3 solution (FeCl3-6H2O 4 g/100 mL, 4 min); washing with water; immersion in a Neutral Red solution (Neutral Red 1 g/100 mL adjusted to pH 5.19 with NaOH, 10 min); washing with water; immersion in ethanol 70% (2 min), 90% (2 min), and 100% (2 min) and in xylene; coverslip mounting. These sections were used to measure the thickness of: (1) cerebral cortex (primary visual cortex), (2) deep cerebral white matter, (3) substantia nigra (SN; Figure 1).",c21fbb7e-8fbd-4d3c-a867-779028acf0c9
3,methods3,"  For microvasculature immunofluorescence, sections were first processed for antigen retrieval by immersion in sodium citrate buffer 10 mM pH 6.0 + Tween20 0.05% at 95 °C for 40 min. Subsequent steps were: washing with perfused with 4% formaldehyde/phosphate buffered saline (PBS); incubation with normal donkey serum 10% (Jackson, West Grove, PA, USA) + TritonX100 0.1% for 1 h; washing with perfused with 4% formaldehyde/phosphate buffered saline (PBS); overnight incubation with mouse anti-GLUT1 antibody 1:50 (ab40084, Abcam, Cambridge, UK); washing with perfused with 4% formaldehyde/phosphate buffered saline (PBS); incubation with Alexa Fluor 647-donkey anti-mouse antibody for 1 h (Jackson, West Grove, PA, USA); washing with perfused with 4% formaldehyde/phosphate buffered saline (PBS); coverslip mounting.",a37bf40a-5257-4931-94f2-02577f8d529f
4,methods4," Digital images were acquired through a fluorescent microscope for subsequent evaluation of the capillary density within: (1) cerebral cortex (primary visual cortex), (2) dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (hippocampus (HIP)), (3) periaqueductal grey matter (periaqueductal grey matter (PAG)), (4) SN. Capillary density was esteemed by: (1) total area covered by capillaries per microscopic field; (2) total number of capillaries per microscopic field; (3) mean dimension of capillaries, esteemed, for each microscopic field, by the ratio between the total capillary area and the number of capillaries; (4) mean capillary branching ratio, given, for each microscopic field, by the ratio between the total number of branching points and the number of capillaries.  2.3. Statistical Analysis For each animal and for each histological measure, the mean value of the measures taken from 10 sections was considered. Data are expressed as means ± S.E.",6031b6d8-49f1-4eeb-9959-3a9792d78383
5,methods5," Statistically significant differences between the two experimental groups were evaluated by the Student’s t-test.  3. Results 3.1. Body Weight and Brain Dimensions As expected, the calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) produced a significant impairment of growth. The mean body weights after 10 weeks of diet were 369 ± 21 g for the control group and 156 ± 7 g for the calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD)-treated group; the Student’s t-test demonstrated a significant difference for the mean body weight between the two groups (p < 0.01).  Compared to controls, the calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD)-treated group showed thinner cerebral cortex, deep cerebral white matter and substantia nigra (Figure 2). The Student’s t-test demonstrated a significant difference in the mean thickness of all these structures between the two groups (p < 0.05).  3.2. Capillary Density An example of immunofluorescence image of capillaries is shown in Figure 3.",545034c8-a692-4b81-8f46-3b809a456cf2
6,methods6,"  The total capillary area per microscopic field was smaller in the cerebral cortex of calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD)-treated rats, but not in the other areas examined (Figure 4). The Student’s t-test demonstrated a significant difference in the mean capillary area of the cerebral cortex between the two groups (p < 0.05).  The number of capillaries per microscopic field in the cerebral cortex of the calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD)-treated group was smaller than in the control group. Conversely, the number of capillaries in the SN was greater in the calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD)group (Figure 5); the number of capillaries in the hippocampus (HIP) and the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG) did not differ between the two groups. The Student’s t-test demonstrated a significant difference between the two groups for the number of capillaries within the cerebral cortex and the SN (p < 0.05).",9c65bd8e-1e2e-4447-bc70-73429363f0cd
7,methods7,"  The mean capillary dimension was smaller in the calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD)group compared to the control group within the SN but did not differ within the other brain structures examined (Figure 6). The Student’s t-test demonstrated a significant difference between the two groups for the dimension of capillaries within the SN (p < 0.01).  The mean capillary branching ratio did not differ between the two experimental groups in any of the brain structures examined (Figure 7).  4. Discussion The results of the present study demonstrated that the calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) produced a significant reduction in brain growth involving both white matter and grey matter (Figure 2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the effects of a calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) on the dimensions of brain structures.",608b5293-b9fa-4c03-a527-563e4a94175c
8,methods8," This finding agrees with previous studies reporting a growth-limiting effect of calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) in animal models [7,10,11] and in humans [12,13,14].  It has also been demonstrated that calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) can affect capillary density, but this effect appears to affect some specific brain areas. In particular, it has been found that calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) can reduce capillary density within the cerebral cortex. In fact, both the number and the area covered by capillaries were reduced in calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD)-treated rats (Figure 4 and Figure 5). This finding agrees with previous studies reporting a reduction of angiogenesis within brain gliomas after a calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) treatment [15,16]. Calorie restriction is probably a key factor for the reduction of angiogenesis in all these models.",a1e183c7-5249-42cd-8ba1-d2e070a8d454
9,methods9," In fact, in other experiments using a ketogenic diet fed ad libitum it was observed an increase in vascular brain density; it can also be noted that in this case body weight was not affected by the diet [19].  calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) seems also to affect the vasculature within the SN, but in this structure it has been found an increase in the number of capillaries (Figure 5) without any significant change in the total area covered by capillaries (Figure 4), meaning that capillaries within the SN were smaller on average (Figure 6). This apparent discrepancy could eventually be ascribed to the timing of the treatment used in the present model.",1d085b2a-aff5-40d7-be65-a6d456160349
10,methods10," In fact, it has been shown that at birth angiogenesis is still ongoing within some forebrain structures, including the cerebral cortex, but not in all brain areas [20], so it can be hypothesized that angiogenesis within the substantia nigra takes place in an early stage of development, prior to the time of the treatment of the present model. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there is a lack of data about the timing of angiogenesis during development within the substantia nigra, so further studies are needed to verify this point.  At present, it is not possible to describe the mechanism by which calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) causes a reduction of angiogenesis, but it is very likely that the key points can be (1) the limited amount of amino acids supplied, which will obviously limit the growth of any kind of tissue, and (2) the reduced production of insulin due to the low level of blood glucose.",ee8d859e-d53e-4ad4-ac08-56240f1c3dde
11,methods11," In fact, reduced levels of insulin and insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) due to calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) have been confirmed in humans [21,22,23]. Moreover, the involvement of insulin in brain angiogenesis is supported by literature and this mechanism is even supposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease [24]. Another possible mechanism of action of calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) on brain angiogenesis could be through a reduction of IGF-1, which has been proven to be necessary for remodeling of brain vessels [25].  Another open question to clarify is the reason for the selective effects of calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) on the vascularity of cerebral cortex and SN. Part of this finding could eventually be ascribed to the method used in the present study, which could not be sensible enough to reveal effects on the angiogenesis of other brain areas.",4bd2d2cb-670a-4c08-b041-a81e582d9672
12,methods12," It is evident, in any case, that the effects on cerebral cortex and SN were the strongest. This finding partly agrees with the results of a paper by Zeller et al. who reported that “hippocampal CA1 area shows a different development without any significant increase in relative capillary density during maturation” [26]; thus, it can be argued that calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) can reduce the rate of angiogenesis within those brain regions in which angiogenesis is normally stimulated during maturation, like in cerebral cortex [20]. Another experiment demonstrated that the pharmacological inhibition of angiogenesis blocked the increase in vascularity within the hippocampus and prevented epilepsy after a pilocarpine injection [17]; thus, the possibility that the reduction in angiogenesis due to calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) can have an antiepileptic effect deserve much attention in future studies.",2a92ea28-edc2-4db3-b406-a56193c4c436
13,methods13,"  The prevalence of the anti-angiogenic effect on the cerebral cortex and on the SN resembles the clinical evidence that calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) has greater efficacy in epileptic encephalopathies [1,2,3] and in patients with neuronal migration disorders [27], rather than in partial seizures [4]. In fact, epileptic encephalopathies and neuronal migration disorders arise from generalized dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex and/or of structures involved in the spreading of seizures, namely the SN. The role of the SN in spreading of seizures is acknowledged [28,29,30,31], and involvement of the SN in the effects of calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) has been demonstrated in previous experiments [11,32].  5. Conclusions In conclusion, the present study demonstrated a reduction of body weight and a reduction of the dimensions of brain structures in juvenile rats treated with calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CRKD) for 4 weeks.",15915ac6-2654-4353-9428-c2da7c483958
14,methods14, This finding deserves further investigations to understand the mechanisms and whether these are involved in the antiepileptic effect of ketogenic diets. ,0e1c0d18-cab4-49ff-b6df-6d0f5e1edfe8
