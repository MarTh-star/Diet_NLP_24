0,background0," Ketogenic dietary therapy (Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT)) is used as an effective treatment for epilepsy. However, Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) carries the risk of bone health deterioration; therefore, vitamin D supplementation is required. Vitamin D replacement therapy in Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) has not been established because it may be related to hypercalciuria/urolithiasis, which are common adverse effects of Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT). Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the dose-dependent association between vitamin D3 and hypercalciuria/urolithiasis in patients undergoing Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) and dose optimization for renal complications.

1,methods0," Participants  Overall, 140 patients with intractable childhood epilepsy were started on Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) at a 3:1 lipid to non-lipid ratio in the pediatric neurology department of Severance Children’s Hospital, Seoul, South Korea from January 2016 to December 2019. All patients were referred to the pediatric endocrine department for monitoring the endocrinologic adverse effects of Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), such as growth retardation, dyslipidemia, multivitamin deficiency, and hypothyroidism. Among these patients, those who maintained Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) for > 3 months and regularly visited the pediatric endocrine department for monitoring were included in this study. Regular outpatient visits were recommended at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, unless there were medical issues.",7c83e8b2-e80b-4962-9de3-e07f22c20842
2,methods1," Patients who already had urolithiasis and received hydrochlorothiazide before Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), failed to maintain Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) for 3 months, did not take the prescribed calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation properly, or did not undergo endocrinological follow-up studies including biochemical laboratory tests, were excluded. Additionally, we excluded patients requiring prolonged hospitalization due to serious illness after Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) initiation, since the changes in their systemic condition and changes in treatment such as AEDs and Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) could significantly alter their clinical aspects. Further, data from patients who started diuretic agents, such as hydrochlorothiazide, were eliminated from that point in time because the excretion of calcium in the urine may be altered in these patients. Finally, 49 patients were included in this study.",50536e6a-5357-44b6-8e8d-0a19d6ca553c
3,methods2," Among those who continued Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), 6-month data were obtained from 38 patients and 1-year data were obtained from 22 patients.  The type and dosage of AEDs were not changed significantly during Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), and the formulations were modified to contain as little carbohydrates as possible. Patients on Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) were supplemented with multivitamins, L-carnitine, calcium, and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). We used a combination tablet containing 100 mg of calcium and 1,000 IU of vitamin D3 per pill for calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Daily doses of calcium and vitamin D3 were approximated based on weight: 0.5 tablets (elemental 50 mg of calcium and 500 IU of vitamin D3) for a bodyweight up to 10 kg, 1.0 tablet (100 mg of elemental calcium and 1,000 IU of vitamin D3) for a bodyweight of 10–20 kg, 1.",a9597742-ff36-45ed-a253-a1b201d2eea9

If the serum 25-OH-D3 level was < 20 ng/mL or > 50 ng/mL, the doses of the calcium and vitamin D3 complex were increased or decreased by 0.25 tablets (25 mg of elemental calcium and 250 IU of vitamin D3).  The Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital Clinical Trial Center (subject no. 4-2020-0549) approved this study.

Serum calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase levels were measured using Hitachi chemistry autoanalyzer 7600-110 (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at the central laboratory of Severance Hospital. Serum 25-OH-D3 level was determined using a radioimmunoassay (DiaSorin, Inc., Stillwater, MN, United States; intraassay CV < 4.1%, inter-assay CV < 7.0%). The serum PTH concentration was measured at our hospital using a second-generation PTH assay (Elecsys PTH; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) on the Cobas e801 immunoassay analyzer (Roche Diagnostics).",cc3fcb6f-db43-4333-ac33-11843ec3df03

Three months after Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) initiation with an average vitamin D3 supplementation of 50.8 IU/kg, only one patient had hypercalcemia (serum calcium, 11.4 mg/dL; normal range, 8.5–10.5 mg/dL). The patient was administered 55.6 IU/kg of vitamin D3 and 100 mg of elemental calcium, and their 25-OH-D3 level increased from 30.84 to 46.7 ng/mL and PTH level was low at 7.8°pg/mL. In addition, he had hypercalciuria, with a Uca/Ucr ratio of 2.56. Therefore, we reduced the supplemental doses of vitamin D3 and calcium by half (vitamin D3, 27.8 IU/kg; elemental calcium, 50 mg/kg).

12,results9," Age at Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) initiation, height, weight, and 25-OH-D3 levels were negatively associated with Uca/Ucr ratio (Figure 1 and Table 2). Additionally, an increased dose of vitamin D3 supplementation (odds ratio = 0.956; p = 0.028) and a sufficient 25-OH-D3 level (odds ratio = 0.888; p = 0.010) decreased the risk of hypercalciuria (Figure 2 and Table 3).

Further, nine patients (40.9%) had hypercalciuria.",35a81465-0e09-456c-99f4-b70efc97ddb9
14,results11," The dose of vitamin D3 supplementation and 25-OH-D3 levels did not affect the Uca/Ucr ratio, whereas height and 25-OH-D3 levels were negatively associated with Uca/Ucr ratio (Table 2). However, none of these factors increased the risk of hypercalciuria occurrence (Table 3).  In the analysis of the overall follow-up period in which the time variable was corrected through the linear mixed model, the increased dose of vitamin D3 supplementation (odds ratio = 0.976; p = 0.043) and increased 25-OH-D3 level (odds ratio = 0.945; p = 0.002) decreased the risk of hypercalciuria, consistent with the trend shown at 3 and 6 months.  Urolithiasis developed in three patients (6.1%): two boys and one girl. Patient 1 was a 3-month-old boy for whom vitamin D3 (60.98 IU/kg) was prescribed and discontinued 6 months after Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) initiation because of kidney stone formation. Patient 2 was a 7-year-old girl for whom 45.66 IU/kg of vitamin D3 was prescribed.",7197d2fd-fb79-46af-88d1-2a5329b5c04d
15,results12," She was diagnosed as having urolithiasis 6 months after Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) initiation; however, vitamin D3 supplementation was continued.

Patient 3 was a 19-month-old boy who was diagnosed with urolithiasis 9 months after Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) initiation and vitamin D3 supplementation (51.02 IU/kg), even though he did not develop hypercalciuria during the follow-up period.",2f83d98f-5c3e-47b6-9c13-fc4bb7b6a93c

17,discussion0," To our best knowledge, this is the first study to assess the relationship between several clinical variables, including vitamin D3 dose, serum 25-OH-D3 level, and occurrence of hypercalciuria/urolithiasis in pediatric Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) patients. We found that serum 25-OH-D3 level and hypercalciuria have an inverse correlation, and as 25-OH-D3 level rises by 1.0 ng/mL, Uca/Ucr ratio decreases by 0.011. The optimal serum 25-OH-D3 level for preventing hypercalciuria was > 39.1 ng/mL, and the cut-off vitamin D3 supplementation dose was > 49.5 IU/kg.  Kidney stone formation is a complex process, which includes urine supersaturation and nucleation, growth, aggregation, and retention of crystals in the kidney (13). Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) can cause kidney stone formation, and the incidence of urolithiasis in children undergoing Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) is 1.4–7% (5, 10, 16).",cf65a025-3273-4064-804f-d414cd822673
18,discussion1," This might be due to hyperuricemia, which increases calcium excretion related to metabolic acidosis, or urine acidification, which results in uric acid supersaturation and decreased urinary citrate concentration (5). According to the “free-particle theory” and “fixed-particle theory,” supersaturated urine is the key process involved in kidney stone formation because the formation and growth of crystals occurs within highly saturated urine (11, 17).  It is unclear whether vitamin D supplementation or high serum 25-OH-D3 level increases the risk of hypercalciuria or kidney stone formation. Many physicians are hesitant to treat vitamin D deficiency in patients with kidney stones because of concerns that vitamin D3 supplementation increases urinary calcium excretion. This hesitation might be because the most prevalent type of kidney stone is calcium based, and vitamin D increases intestinal calcium absorption and then urinary calcium excretion (18).",8986c626-b1fe-4c4c-a1c8-aa3c1b231da5
19,discussion2," Calcitriol binds to vitamin D receptors in enterocytes and increases calcium absorption (19). In addition, intestinal calcium absorption is increased in absorptive hypercalciuria (20), and calcitriol serum levels are also correlated with urinary calcium excretion (21). According to a systematic review and meta-analysis, increased circulating calcitriol was associated with kidney stones, and among patients with urolithiasis, circulating 25-OH-D3 levels were markedly higher in hypercalciuria than in normocalciuria (22). Therefore, vitamin D is often cited as a risk factor for hypercalciuria and kidney stones (19).  However, several studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation is not associated with urolithiasis. In a prospective study, despite supplementation with high-dose vitamin D3 (mean daily dose, 3,440 IU) in healthy controls to maintain 25-OH-D3 levels within 30–88 ng/mL for 6 months, no hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria was noted (23).",3747ec06-7c06-41c3-b6d7-fb59e826dc35
20,discussion3," Another study on patients with urolithiasis showed that hypercalciuria or significant changes in urinary calcium excretion did not occur when 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 was administered each week, and there was no relation between 25-OH-D3 level change and urinary calcium excretion (24). A large systematic review and meta-analysis study found that vitamin D supplementation may increase the risk of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, but did not increase the risk of kidney stone formation, regardless of the duration of supplementation, dosage, co-supplementation with calcium, and baseline 25-OH-D3 level (12). In a large cohort study, there was also no association found between vitamin D3 intake and incidence of kidney stones (25).  Furthermore, despite being controversial, vitamin D deficiency may be a predisposing factor for kidney stone formation. Several studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in patients with kidney stone formation than in those without (26, 27).",7f96dea3-2403-4ce4-93ce-20107436af45
21,discussion4," There are several hypotheses, as follows: first, secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by vitamin D deficiency can lead to urolithiasis. Second, there are several risk factors shared between vitamin D deficiency and urolithiasis, including obesity and decreased dietary calcium intake. Third, vitamin D deficiency might be responsible for inducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the kidney, which can cause urolithiasis (13).  Vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the absorption of dietary calcium, resulting in secondary hyperparathyroidism, which attempts to maintain serum calcium by mobilizing calcium from the bones by increasing osteoclastic activity. These processes decrease bone mineral density. Moreover, hyperparathyroidism increases phosphorus wasting in the kidneys, which results in a low normal or low serum phosphorus level. This results in an inadequate calcium-phosphorus product, causing a mineralization defect in the bones.",1c559815-b627-43a9-8b80-4609ffdfec30
22,discussion5," Consequently, vitamin D deficiency results in osteopenia and osteoporosis (15).  In addition to bone health, vitamin D has various health benefits, as vitamin D receptors exist in most tissues and cells and active vitamin D influences the expression levels of more than 200 genes (28). Vitamin D deficiency causes muscle weakness, whereas increased 25-OH-D3 level markedly improves performance speed and proximal muscle strength (29). Further, vitamin D has recently been found to be a key factor in the immune system, as (1) it induces the production of antimicrobial peptides and cytokines, (2) it simulates autophagy for controlling intracellular infections, and (3) vitamin D signaling promotes innate immune response. Thus, vitamin D deficiency is associated with susceptibility toward infections (30).",8d7c0990-5df6-402a-b62d-f2ee1012bd85
23,discussion6," In addition, active vitamin D has biological actions, including angiogenesis, renin production, insulin stimulation, macrophage cathelicidin production, and cellular proliferation inhibition (31). In chronic inflammatory diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and autoimmune diseases, vitamin D is supposed to play an important role in gene regulation (32), and supraphysiological doses of the active form of vitamin D may reduce excessive cell proliferation, even in cancer (31). Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation has been suggested to be potentially preventative against cardiovascular diseases through several mechanisms including upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, blood pressure increase, and ventricular musculo-hypertrophy (33). In a meta-analysis of eight prospective cohort study, the group with the lower 20% of serum vitamin D levels was associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality (34).",19734e3f-e42e-433f-969f-b391e0fd6eab
24,discussion7," Vitamin D deficiency is also correlated with dyslipidemia (35) and is thought to be more influential in high-fat diets such as Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT).  Given the known benefits of vitamin D in maintaining bone health and its potential benefits for cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases, and given findings suggesting its safety, active vitamin D supplementation is required in patients undergoing Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT). In addition, we found out that maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D is helpful for hypercalciuria and urolithiasis. Serum 25-OH-D3 level and Uca/Ucr ratio showed an inverse correlation during Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), and although not statistically significant, Uca/Ucr ratio decreased with an increase in the dose of vitamin D3 supplementation per weight. In addition, results at 6 months of Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) showed that 25-OH-D3 level of < 39.1 ng/mL and inadequate vitamin D supplementation of < 49.",9803239a-9aa2-420d-beca-563b2cdbc02b
25,discussion8,"5 IU/kg could also increase the risk of hypercalciuria. Therefore, it might be helpful to maintain sufficient serum levels of vitamin D (almost 40 ng/mL) and implement vitamin D supplementation (50 IU/kg) to prevent hypercalciuria.  Although there is no consensus on the optimal serum levels of 25-OH-D3, vitamin D deficiency is defined with a 25-OH-D3 level of < 20 ng/mL, relative insufficiency with levels between 20 and 29 ng/mL, and sufficient level is ≥ 30 ng/mL. Further, vitamin D poisoning is defined by 25-OH-D3 level > 150 ng/mL (15, 28). In a study involving adults, the maximum bone mineral density was achieved when the 25-OH-D3 level reached ≥ 40 ng/mL (29). The recommended dose of vitamin D supplementation in children is approximately 400–1,000 IU per day to avoid deficiency and maintain the proper range and 1,000–2,000 IU per day with calcium supplementation for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency (15).",852bd3d1-2e21-43ce-b396-2464476fbd75
26,discussion9," According to our findings, the optimal 25-OH-D3 level and supplemental doses are similar to those previously recommended by experts. Therefore, although it is necessary to adjust the vitamin D supplementation dose according to the patient’s condition, it is better to actively supplement vitamin D than to hesitate due to concerns about hypercalciuria and urolithiasis.  This study has several limitations. First, it was a retrospective study conducted only with patients who received Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) of 3:1 ratio. Moreover, regular visits were difficult for candidates of this study due to severe neurological disorders and a higher risk of complication compared with normal children. For these reasons, a follow-up duration of > 6 months was difficult for many patients, which was thought to be the reason for the absence of clear statistical association over the entire follow-up period.",724017c5-7c6b-43df-bafb-edadc0efdc75
27,discussion10," Statistically significant results were obtained only from data within 6 months of the optimal 25-OH-D3 level and appropriate dose of vitamin D supplementation. Second, this study was conducted only on consecutive patients who were referred to the pediatric endocrine department of a single institute, suggesting a distortion in our conclusion owing to the inevitable selection bias. Third, we failed to consider the effects of the anticonvulsants and the supplemental nutrients used by the subjects. AEDs like carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may affect urinary calcium excretion. Herein, nine and seven patients were taking zonisamide and topiramate, respectively, during Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT). However, as these medications are often prescribed for intractable epilepsy, several other patients also used those medications before Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT). As we could not determine the effects of those medications, we did not exclude patients taking them.",3a9a70c5-969a-4795-90ea-1fd19a30934b
28,discussion11," Though there were no prescription of important supplemental nutrients except multivitamins, personal checks for all the purchased supplements were not possible; hence, we were unable to consider the effects of other supplements.  Nevertheless, this study was meaningful because it gave suggestions for vitamin D supplementation to children on Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), who are at risk of poor bone health and secondary osteoporosis. Some of the study results showed that contrary to the traditional belief, vitamin D supplementation can help reduce the risk of hypercalciuria during Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT). In addition, we believe that this study can provide a new perspective on the kidney-related side effects that are generally of concern when vitamin D supplementation is implemented.",661702d5-5ab8-4509-84ce-5fb3457b92ce
29,discussion12," Hypercalciuria and urolithiasis are associated with dietary factors such as intake of fewer fruits and vegetables and more red meat and salt (13, 36), making it difficult to control the variables in a normal population. In this regard, our study has the advantage that it was conducted under the same, controlled dietary conditions. In addition, the results will be applicable to children undergoing Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT).  In conclusion, we recommend that all children on Ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) receive 50 IU/kg of daily vitamin D supplementation and maintain a serum 25-OH-D3 level of 40 ng/mL to minimize the incidence of hypercalciuria. Further studies with larger numbers of multicenter patients over a longer period of follow-up are required for more evidence and better recommendations.
