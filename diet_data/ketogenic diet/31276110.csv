0,introduction0,"Medium-chain fatty acids (Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA)), namely fatty acids with an aliphatic tail of 6–12 carbon atoms, are food constituents, extracted from some plant oils and milk, where they are mostly present in the form of triacylglycerols .  Unlike long-chain fatty acids (long chain fatty acids (LCFA)) which, after intestinal adsorption, are esterified to triacylglycerols in enterocytes, incorporated into chylomicrons and released into the lymphatic system, Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) directly enter the portal vein from the intestinal tract as free acids (Ashbrook et al., 1972, 1975). There, partly bound to plasma albumin, Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are transported to the liver where they are metabolized. Therefore, dietary Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are not stored in esterified form in adipose tissue (Schönfeld and Wojtczak, 2016).",784751e9-be40-40a2-8175-13d71f659097
1,introduction1,"  Once in the liver Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA), at least those with up to C8 carbon atoms, spread through the inner mitochondrial membrane and, in the mitochondrial matrix, are activated to acyl-CoA. This characteristic further differentiates Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) from long chain fatty acids (LCFA), the latter being activated in the cytosol by acyl-CoA synthases, and requiring the carnitine shuttle to pass the inner mitochondrial membrane and enter mitochondria .  Medium-chain fatty acids, activated inside mitochondria, are mainly used as substrates in β-oxidation and in the citric acid cycle (Schönfeld and Wojtczak, 2016). The excess of acetyl-CoA derived from β-oxidation promotes the hepatic generation of ketones (mostly acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate), which are delivered as fuels to non-hepatic tissues (Bach and Babayan, 1982; Papamandjaris et al., 1998).",97a304b2-fa92-4a23-939d-80c751aa05c1
2,introduction2,"  Data obtained in an animal model suggest that Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) can cross the blood-brain barrier and can be oxidized by the brain through mitochondrial β-oxidation (Spector, 1998). In this way, Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) provide both a direct and an indirect fuel source for brain cells (neurons and astrocytes) via the generation of ketone bodies which can further be used by the brain as a metabolic fuel (Nugent et al., 2014; Andersen et al., 2017; Evans et al., 2017).  As components of ketogenic diets, Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are believed to act as alternative energy substrates in the injured brain. Indeed, Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are used as alternative energy substrates in conditions of limited cerebral glucose availability, such as in traumatic brain injury (Prins and Matsumoto, 2014; Bernini et al., 2020), patients with glucose transporter 1 deficiency , and Alzheimer’s disease .",eea6427e-28f9-4e04-baca-886457459ddd
3,introduction3," Considering that the brain is highly susceptible to free radical formation , an antioxidant effect of an Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA)-based ketogenic diet on the brain has also been reported . Moreover, besides having antioxidant properties, Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) have been used to treat a variety of disorders such as drug-resistant epilepsy , diabetes , and cancer .  The beneficial effects of Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) on the brain are mainly attributed to the ability of these fatty acids to provide energy sources in the form of lactate and ketone bodies . Indeed, an in vitro study reported that C10, but not C8 induced energy metabolism and mitochondrial activity in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y  and increased mitochondrial content and complex I activity in neuronal cells .",5115ba65-29e1-46db-91fe-9471b3255a8b
4,introduction4,"  Despite the relative success of Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) in the treatment of different brain diseases, the precise mechanism of action of these fatty acids in the brain is still unknown.  In the last few years, metabolite quantification by Mass Spectrometry approaches has been used to obtain a global unbiased view of small molecules in different biological samples thus contributing to the understanding of the molecular characteristics of many diseases and therapeutic outcomes in different pathologies (Vergara et al., 2019; Casadei-Gardini et al., 2020).  In the present work, by means of a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics approach we revealed metabolic changes in U87MG glioblastoma cells after the addition of C8 or C10 for 24 h.  Our results underline significant differences in C8 and C10 effects on U87MG cell metabolism.",02da1456-1d0d-45ae-8317-f6e56ba05bdd
5,introduction5," In particular, while C8 addition to glioma cells mainly affects mitochondrial metabolism with increased synthesis of ketone bodies, C10 has a major effect on cytosolic pathways by increasing glucose conversion to lactate. Moreover, C10 but not C8 increases lipid synthesis as demonstrated by both metabolomic and western blot analyses.  ",4b0e6921-1134-44f4-99f8-49494fa6af1f

Metabolites from each sample were extracted in parallel and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The chromatographic spectra were dominated by high-intensity signals of sugars and small molecules, such as branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), aliphatic and aromatic amino acids (alanine, arginine, glutamine, glutamate, methionine, glycine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine), organic acids (lactate, pyruvate, citrate, acetoacetate, and β-hydroxybutyrate), and others.",f78d35f7-eec9-41eb-a5a1-fa5c5f357c68

Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA can derive also from fatty acids β-oxidation or glycolytic pyruvate through the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH)). When in the mitochondrial matrix acetyl-CoA exceeds oxaloacetate (OAA) amounts, acetyl-CoA can be used for ketone body production (ketone body metabolism). However, cancer cells can also produce a high level of lactate from glycolytic pyruvate, also in the presence of functioning mitochondria (Warburg effect).",e9c758d3-185e-4a34-b617-c85ebe651ed1

To analyze the pathway of fatty acid synthesis in U87MG cells, we measured the rate of [1-14C] acetate incorporation into fatty acids. Interestingly, after 1 h of incubation with the labeled precursor, C10-treated cells incorporated significantly higher (∼2 fold) labeled acetate into fatty acids compared with both C8-treated and control (CTR) cells (Figure 5A).

29,discussion0,"There is growing interest in the mode of Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) action particularly in the brain, considering their beneficial effects on different neurological diseases that have been recently reported (Klepper et al., 2004; Nugent et al., 2014; Prins and Matsumoto, 2014; Andersen et al., 2017; Evans et al., 2017; Nathan et al., 2019; Rusek et al., 2019; Bernini et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). Studies have shown that C8 and C10 have a different metabolism in the brain which might derive from a different cell processing of these two fatty acids. In particular, while C8 can enter mitochondria without requiring the carnitine shuttle, C10 seems to be activated in the cytosol and to require the presence of carnitine to enter mitochondria .",d6254b3f-154e-4571-a276-d2f44b6a610c
30,discussion1,"  Although most of the beneficial effects of Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) have been attributed to ketone body formation for a long-time, some studies have challenged the central role of these molecules, raising the question whether other possible Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA)-derived metabolites may play a relevant role in brain disease treatments.  In this study, to cover the broadest possible range of metabolic characteristics, we examined the biological effects of 300 μM C8 or C10 through an untargeted GC/MS-based metabolomics approach. It should be noted that the amount of Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) we used throughout the study was compatible with the plasma level of these fatty acids found in epileptic patients treated with the Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA)-containing ketogenic diet .  We found that C10-treated, but not C8-treated cells showed increased amounts of glucose and lactate compared with control (CTR).",7c239a3e-3f64-48f4-ba7a-a004f80e82d0
31,discussion2," We speculated that C10 could increase the flux of glucose to lactate as already demonstrated for C10-treated astrocytes . This process, thought to be characteristic of cancer cells, is known as the Warburg Effect and represents the incomplete, non-oxidative metabolism of glucose even in the presence of oxygen (Warburg, 1925; Warburg, 1956). It is of note that the Enrichment Analysis highlighted a high impact of the Warburg effect, lactate synthesis and glycolysis in C10-treated cells compared with control (CTR).  It is well known that glucose represents the major substrate for de novo lipogenesis. In this case, pyruvate produced by glycolysis can enter mitochondria to be converted into acetyl-CoA by the complex of the pyruvate dehydrogenase.",b2c1c596-ccc3-4eb2-9b07-0ad5441fae11

Then cytosolic citrate is converted to acetyl-CoA by ATP citrate lyase (Browning and Horton, 2004). De novo synthesis of fatty acids begins with ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). Malonyl-CoA, which serves as a two-carbon donor, is added to the acetyl-CoA primer by a multifunctional enzyme complex of fatty acid synthase (FAS) to form palmitic acid.  Citrate, in the cytosol, represents not only the primer for the synthesis of lipids but also a positive allosteric modulator for acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme in the lipogenic pathway.",bf43ea0b-abee-43ac-83d2-217c760fe903
33,discussion4,"  Considering the higher level of citrate and palmitate measured in U87MG cells after C10-, but not C8-addition to cells, compared with control (CTR) cells, we speculated that C10 could stimulate fatty acid synthesis in U87MG cells. It should be noted that a lipogenic effect of Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) has been already demonstrated in isolated hepatocytes, with a greater stimulatory effect of C10 with respect to C8, reaching the highest value with C12:0 (Geelen, 1994). The higher rate of acetate incorporation into fatty acids associated with increased expression of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) confirmed our hypothesis about the stimulated fatty acid synthesis in U87MG cells after C10- but not C8-addition.  It has been demonstrated that decanoic acid is a PPARγ agonist and this characteristic seems to be specific to decanoic acid and unlikely to be shared by octanoic acid, the other major component of the MCT ketogenic diet .",1fb297a7-2cd8-44fa-b3ce-fe2abd17167f
34,discussion5," Considering that PPARγ is able to regulate the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1c, which in turn induces the expression of the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase, we can speculate that C10 stimulates de novo lipogenesis in U87MG cells by a PPARγ-mediated mechanism . In particular conditions cancer cells prefer glutamine to glucose for lipid synthesis . In this case, glutamine can be converted to glutamate and α-KG in mitochondria . The glutamine-derived α-KG is converted to citrate through both reductive and oxidative carboxylation and thereby contributes to de novo lipogenesis . In C10-treated cells, we found an increasing amount of α-KG and citrate, with a lower level of glutamine, compared with both C8-treated and control (CTR) cells. We speculated that C10 can increase glutamine conversion into lipids.",8d182ff3-50a4-4532-9b36-afd0affbf510
35,discussion6," Notably, both Metabolic Pathway analysis, and Pathway Enrichment Analysis reported an important impact of glutamine and glutamate metabolism’ on C10-treated cells.  An interesting aspect worthy of attention is the high content of malonate found in C10-treated cells compared with C8-treated and control (CTR) cells. Malonate is an endogenous metabolite and a well-characterized competitive inhibitor of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the electron chain transport complex II. Malonate can be cytotoxic by blocking the citric acid cycle and cellular respiration . The molecular source of malonate in eukaryotic cells is not well defined. Mitochondrial malonate may derive from the hydrolysis of mitochondrial oxaloacetate (OAA) through the decarboxylase activity of oxaloacetate (OAA) decarboxylase .",ee1916ed-33fc-4a35-9612-3fb5eb1234da
36,discussion7," Malonate can be also formed by cytosolic malonyl-CoA hydrolysis and subsequently transported into the mitochondrial matrix via dicarboxylic acid transporters of the inner mitochondrial membrane . Thus, by blocking the citric acid cycle, malonate produced in C10-treated cells could address metabolite flux vs citrate. Due to the lower level of glutamine, and the higher amount of α-KG and citrate measured in C10-treated cells compared with control (CTR), we speculated that C10, the increased level of malonate, upon C10 addition to the cells, could direct glutamine toward fatty acid synthesis, thus driving reductive metabolism. If this is the case, our results could explain why mitochondrial C10 βoxidation was found markedly lower than that of C8 in both SH−SY5Y cells and astrocytes .",8bc7851a-0b19-44c2-aa44-583e5c029f00
37,discussion8,"  We observed that the addition of C8 to cells increased lauric acid, myristic acid, oleic acid, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate levels compared with both control (CTR) and C10-treated cells. These data could indicate that C8, once activated inside the mitochondrial matrix, could undergo chain elongation before being oxidized. Hence, considering the lower level of oxaloacetate (OAA) measured in C8 vs both control (CTR) and C10-treated cells we can speculate that the acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid oxidation could diverge toward ketone body synthesis, thus justifying the higher level of β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate in C8- compared with both C10-treated cells and control (CTR) cells. Our data are in accordance with those reported in Thevenet et al. (2016), Sonnay et al. (2019) about the increased secretion of ketone bodies after C8- more than C10-addition to astrocytes.",c691f023-9ba8-4f1e-8d57-3970f7e6757b
38,discussion9," It should be noted that the Metabolic Pathway analysis indicates the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies as a relevant pathway in C8-treated U87MG cells. Particularly, it has been reported that a carbon chain-length elongation process precedes the oxidation of medium-chain fatty acids in skin fibroblasts .  Overall, our study demonstrated, for the first time, a lipogenic effect of C10 on glioblastoma cells. These data could be of interest considering that fatty acid synthesis can sustain cell proliferation, being lipid building blocks for membrane construction. On the other hand, fatty acids can cause death in cancer cells due to detergent-like effects . Thus, although our study requires further consideration, it provides interesting insights and directs our attention to the potential use of decanoate in brain cancers.",c4fa9e45-3a35-42ee-9322-507e56964833
