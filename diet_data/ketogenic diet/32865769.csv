0,introduction0," The ketogenic diet is a very-low-carbohydrate, high-fat nutritional approach that induces a metabolic shift to the use of ketone bodies as a significant energy source. For decades, the ketogenic diet has been employed to manage drug-resistant epilepsy , but recently it is increasingly considered as an alternative or add-on therapy in many other pathological conditions, including central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)) disorders (Włodarek, 2019). The available data suggests that besides its well-known metabolic effects, including ketonemia, and decreased blood glucose and insulin levels, the ketogenic diet has many other beneficial health effects . There is evidence that the ketogenic diet improves cellular metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis and reduces oxidative stress . A large number of studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective properties of the ketogenic diet (reviewed in Yang et al.",3c05d724-3867-4015-acff-084fe5e84180
1,introduction1,", 2019), but there is still a lot to discover to comprehensively understand the underlying mechanisms. The ketogenic diet results in a number of changes observed in the brain on a molecular and cellular level, including an improvement of the mitochondrial function and biogenesis, modulation of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, enhancement of purinergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, as well as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (Gasior et al., 2006; Maalouf et al., 2009; Masino and Rho, 2012). It has been proposed that the stimulation of autophagy may be one of the mediators of the neuroprotection afforded by the ketogenic diet . Autophagy as a cellular recycling mechanism is essential for the maintenance of cell homeostasis and viability, especially during stress conditions (Gerónimo-Olvera and Massieu, 2019).",bf191b3c-b2b5-4d86-874a-79f5de56a7ae
2,introduction2," The impairment of autophagy results in cellular dysfunction and abnormal protein accumulation, leading to degenerative changes in mammalian tissues and contributing to the onset of many pathologies, including neurodegeneration (reviewed in Nah et al., 2015). Autophagy is induced in response to increased cellular energetic needs caused e.g., by nutrient deprivation or physical exercise, which are known autophagy inducers not only in peripheral tissues (He et al., 2012a; Bagherniya et al., 2018), but also, in the brain (Alirezaei et al., 2010; He et al., 2012b). The ketogenic diet mimics the biochemical actions of fasting and exerts many physiological and cellular responses similar to those evoked by intermittent energy restriction arising from food deprivation or exercise. The ketogenic diet may induce autophagy through at least a couple of mechanisms; in spite of this, the relationship between nutritional ketosis and autophagy stays largely unexplored.",70ac4bb1-3b17-4b04-9226-f2c18a026db1
3,introduction3," Recently, we have shown that 4-weeks-long feeding with the ketogenic diet caused the upregulation of hepatic autophagy, and the effect was likely dependent on the diet composition . In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the influence of the ketogenic diet on brain autophagy. Here, we report that treatment with the ketogenic diet causes the upregulation of the numbers of autophagic structures in the mouse hippocampus and cerebral cortex, but the hippocampus tends to show a stronger response. Subsequently, we assumed that regional differences in response to the ketogenic diet may be associated with differences in the metabolic profiles of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. It is known that different brain regions show significant differences in fuel metabolism, including glucose  and fatty acids .",727bbae7-3a2a-4c16-9ff1-6c2a4dcb4196
4,introduction4," Scarce data are available in regard to regional differences in ketone body metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS). Brain ketone body metabolism is determined by blood ketone body concentration, transport across the blood-brain barrier (blood brain barrier (BBB)) and into cells, and the activity of ketone body metabolizing enzymes. blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability to ketone bodies increases in response to prolonged ketonemia both in humans and rodents . Regional differences in BHB (β-hydroxybutyrate) uptake and MCT1 distribution have been also observed in the adult rodent brain (Bilger and Nehlig, 1992; Pellerin et al., 1998). However, there is no data showing regional adaptations of ketone body metabolism regulating enzymes to prolonged nutritional ketosis induced by the ketogenic diet.",b14dda31-81d2-4367-8761-3b154541e573
5,introduction5,"  Here, we investigated the local concentrations of ketone bodies BHB and AcAc (acetoacetate), the levels of MCT1 responsible for BHB transport to the brain, and the levels of ketolytic enzymes: SCOT/OXCT1 and BDH1. In comparison to the frontal cortex, the hippocampus showed a stronger response to nutritional ketosis in both changes in the markers of autophagy as well as levels of ketone body utilizing and transporting proteins, which was also accompanied by increased concentrations of ketone bodies in this brain structure.

The minimum number of mice required to obtain consistent data were used, and every effort was taken to minimize the suffering of the animals.  Three different chows were used in the study: standard rodent chow (control diet), ketogenic chow with a higher content of animal-based fats (chow A), and ketogenic chow enriched with fats of plant origin (chow P). All chows were prepared by the local supplier “Wytwórnia Pasz Morawski” (Kcynia, Poland).",1dc8fac3-655b-4c39-95ef-b03d9bb1556d

9,methods3,"  Sample Collection  In order to collect samples for RNA and protein isolation, the animals were decapitated. Afterward, the brain was rapidly removed and put on an ice-chilled metal plate, ventral side up. The entire cerebellum and brainstem were removed. The brain was turned dorsal side up and hemisected. After the removal of the hypothalamus, septum, and striatum, the hippocampi were removed using a curved forceps. Subsequently, a 2.0 mm-thick slice of the prefrontal cortex (prefrontal cortex (PFC)) was cut off from each hemisphere. The brain structures were immersed in RNAlater® (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) or immediately frozen on dry ice (for future preparation of cell lysates) and stored at –80°C until usage.  In order to collect brain specimens for microscopic analysis, the mice were anesthetized (i.p. injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine plus 10 mg/kg xylazine) and sacrificed by a transcardiac perfusion with Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS, pH 7.",01046d3b-3411-4b38-81f9-89ab08d99d30

Measurement of Ketone Bodies  The blood BHB measurements were performed with a glucometer (Optium Xido Neo, Abbott Laboratories) in a drop of whole blood collected from the tip of the tail.  Brain levels of BHB were measured in tissue homogenates with Beta-Hydroxybutyric Acid ELISA Kit (Abbexa Ltd., abx514704) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. An equal volume of each sample was taken for analysis and the BHB concentration was normalized to the amount of protein in the sample.  AcAc concentration was measured in the cortex and hippocampus collected for 24 h before the assay (Acetoacetate Colorimetric Assay Kit, Sigma Aldrich, MAK199) and stored at –80°C, which allowed the avoidance of its biodegradation .",a3ce1898-e06e-43c4-8d41-dc4004acf1a3

19,results1,"  Autophagy Response to the Ketogenic Diet Depends on the Brain Region and Diet Composition  Hippocampal Formation of Autophagosomes Was Enhanced in Response to Ketogenic Diets  Analysis of the LC3 puncta by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 1A) revealed higher numbers of LC3 puncta in the hippocampi of animals fed with the diet composed of plant-based fat [one-way ANOVA, F(2, 11) = 5.38, p = 0.023, Figure 1B]. The increase of LC3 puncta in the KA group did not reach statistical significance. The analyzed objects were divided into four categories depending on their diameter (Figure 1B). The number of LC3 puncta was consistently elevated in the KP group for all size categories. Observations made by fluorescence microscopy were confirmed by the western blot of autophagy regulating proteins (Figure 1C). The level of LC3-II (LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate), a marker of autophagosome formation, increased in the hippocampi of animals fed with both ketogenic diets [F(2, 11) = 12.",cd89ed7e-0c72-4f8b-860d-f3c5c8cde497

The LCII/LCI ratio was changed (Kruskal Wallis H = 11.57, p < 0.0001, Figure 1F) and significantly elevated only in mice fed with the plant fat-based ketogenic diet. Higher levels of LC3-I in the KA group may result from the reduced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II or the upregulation of LC3 expression on the transcriptional level. To clarify this, the level of LC3 mRNA with qRT-PCR was measured. Relative quantification revealed the significant increase of LC3 A mRNA [one-way ANOVA, F(2, 11) = 27.32, p < 0.0001, Figure 1G], but not B isoform (Figure 1H) in both ketogenic groups. This suggests that the upregulation of LC3-I measured by immunoblotting arose from the increased expression of this protein. SQSTM1/p62 links ubiquitinated proteins to the autophagic machinery, thus enabling their degradation.",a2d81c7c-8915-4894-9099-01c8783791e5
21,results3," Since the protein is itself degraded in autophagolysosomes, it may be used as a marker of autophagy.

It has been previously shown that during prolonged starvation, the expression of the substrate SQSTM1/p62 is restored depending on transcriptional upregulation . Thus, the authors speculate that treatment with a ketogenic diet enhances the transcription of SQSTM1/p62. To verify this, qRT-PCR analysis was performed, which showed the mRNA levels of SQSTM1/p62 were elevated in the hippocampal samples of animals from both ketogenic groups (one-way ANOVA F = 13.64, p = 0.0008; p = 0.027 for KA vs. SD and p = 0.0006 for KP vs. SD, Figure 1K).",9dcc8077-19c4-43d9-ba67-ef49090e8e93

30,results12," BDH1 catalyzes the bidirectional reaction regulation of both ketone utilization and synthesis, thus the levels of two more proteins involved in ketogenesis were measured, namely 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-COA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) and 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (hydroxymethyl 3 methylglutaryl CoA lyase (HMGCL)). In the hippocampus, the expression of HMGCS2 [one-way ANOVA, F(2, 11) = 4.785, p = 0.032, Figure 3N] and hydroxymethyl 3 methylglutaryl CoA lyase (HMGCL) [one-way ANOVA F(2, 11) = 4.077, p = 0.0473, Figure 3O] were elevated, reaching the highest level in the KP group. In the cortices, similar trends in HMGCS2 [one-way ANOVA, F(2, 11) = 5.582, p = 0.0212, Figure 3P] and hydroxymethyl 3 methylglutaryl CoA lyase (HMGCL) [one-way ANOVA, F(2, 11) = 4.344, p = 0.0407, Figure 3Q] expression were observed.

32,discussion0," Here, we present the results of the current study, which aimed to evaluate the impact of nutritional ketosis evoked by ketogenic diets on autophagy and ketone body metabolism in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.  It is thought that the neuroprotective effect of the ketogenic diet can be largely attributed to the metabolic switch of the brain to burning ketones instead of glucose . However, in a recent study Hui et al. (2020) performed a quantitative analysis of the labeled circulating metabolites, concluding that during the ketogenic diet the brain mostly utilizes glucose and lactate. This conclusion contradicts the common opinion that KB are a primarily energetic source for neuronal cells during the ketogenic diet (Zhang et al., 2013; Zilberter and Zilberter, 2020), weakening the importance of KB as fuel for the brain. However, Hui et al.",8f479048-9ffb-480a-880c-240f7adc359f
33,discussion1," (2020) measured metabolites in the whole brain homogenates, leaving unanswered the hypothesis that various brain structures may have different predispositions toward the utilization of ketones. Thus, we decided to raise this question in the current study, showing that metabolic responses to ketogenic diets were distinct in the hippocampus compared to the cerebral cortex. In the hippocampus, the levels of both ketone bodies BHB and AcAc were elevated, which was accompanied by an increase in the levels of ketone transporter proteins and utilization enzymes. In the cerebral cortex, only subtle changes were observed. We reported similar observations earlier showing that these brain structures respond differently to physical activity, suggesting differences in their metabolic profiles .",6f883183-fe91-4295-b1ae-fd6b2bba595a
34,discussion2," In comparison with the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus is better adapted to efficient fatty acid metabolism, possessing the highest mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity among the brain structures . Therefore, distinct metabolic adaptations are likely to be launched in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. Intriguingly, this also applies to the autophagic response. Our results show a strong autophagic response—a large number of LC3 puncta as well as a high level of LC3-II in the hippocampus, while these parameters obviously remained unchanged in the cerebral cortex. This is consistent with previous results showing the different autophagic response of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex as a response to oxygen and glucose deprivation assessed in an ex vivo rat brain slice model (Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2015).",a5aa9d92-1df4-4e6d-96da-c8338ca3c3bc
35,discussion3," Another study demonstrated the differences in the dynamics of cerebrocortical and hippocampal autophagy in response to severe hypoglycemia and the hypoglycemic coma as well as D-BHB administration (Torres-Esquivel et al., 2020). This is particularly interesting in the context of the present results because this study showed that exogenous BHB can modulate autophagy favoring the autophagic flux (Torres-Esquivel et al., 2020).  To understand the mechanisms underlying regional differences in autophagic response, there is a need to investigate the pathways responsible for autophagy activation under nutritional ketosis. Despite many potential interconnections, this relationship remains largely unexplored. To our best knowledge, only one study has shown data to date on the effect of the ketogenic diet on hippocampal autophagy , and two studies, including our recent results, on liver autophagy .",13b1ce68-cdd4-4df7-9126-6f6dd1df4932
36,discussion4,"  We observed an increased number of LC3 puncta and an increase in the level of LC3-II form, which indicates the enhanced formation of autophagosomes, after 4 weeks of feeding with ketogenic diets.  No differences in autophagic markers were detected in the investigated brain structures after a short duration of feeding—for 24 or 48 h—while 48 h of feeding with a ketogenic diet was sufficient to induce hepatic autophagy, as we reported previously . This supports the common opinion about the lower levels of basal autophagy and weaker responsiveness of autophagic machinery in the brain in comparison with the peripheral tissues. Intriguingly, in contrast to the liver, we did not observe a reduction in p62 protein levels in the brain of ketogenic diet-fed animals, but we observed that SQSTM1/p62 was upregulated on the transcriptional level.",4abb0d99-3759-4a14-973c-282b812b556e
37,discussion5," This is in line with a previous study showing that the expression of the autophagy substrate SQSTM1/p62 is restored to basal levels during prolonged starvation depending on transcriptional upregulation . The restoration of SQSTM1/p62 was observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HepG2 cells, but not in HeLa and HEK293 cells . Together with our results this suggests a tissue-specific effect of the adaptive response of SQSTM1/p62 overexpression to prolonged autophagy activation. However, it should be mentioned here that the stable level of SQSTM1/p62 might be a consequence of reduced autophagic flux and inefficient degradation of autophagic cargo during nutritional ketosis.",8f663945-0b30-4dee-af70-2b39457f75ca
38,discussion6," We would like to emphasize that the measurements performed in the present study allow the reporting of changes in autophagic markers, but are insufficient for determining if the observed changes result from enhanced autophagy or insufficient autophagic flux, which may be considered as a limitation of the present study.  In both brain regions we observed the stronger upregulation of autophagic markers in animals fed with a plant fat-based ketogenic diet, which is consistent with our previous observations regarding hepatic autophagy. We propose that the strength of autophagy enhancement results from the combined effect of nutritional ketosis and the consumption of nutritional factors, which may act as autophagy modulators themselves or contribute to the production of pro- or anti-autophagic metabolites. Interestingly, the changes in the ketone body utilizing and transporting proteins also tend to be stronger after treatment with the plant fat-based ketogenic diet.",6a125859-ea56-4cc8-a194-40def4ede626
39,discussion7," Why does the plant-based ketogenic chow launch more robust metabolic adaptations? First of all, the diets consist of different compounds which may act as autophagy modulators. The differences most of all concern the fatty acid composition of the chows, inducing changes in the tissue fatty acid content, which we reported in detail previously . As an example, the plant-based diet delivers a high amount of caprylic acid , which is often referred to as the “most ketogenic MCT (Medium Chain Triglycerides)” due to its rapid breakdown from an 8-carbon fatty acid to ketone bodies . Secondly, we observe slightly higher levels of blood ketone level in the plant fat-based diet in comparison to the animal fat-based diet in our experiments (although no significant differences were noted in the measurements performed in this experiment).",34e63558-308c-45f8-a750-80955324cb9c
40,discussion8,"  Finally, the results obtained in the present study open further directions of research—especially regarding the very interesting relationship between local ketone body metabolism and autophagy. The hippocampus showed a stronger response to nutritional ketosis in both changes in the markers of autophagy as well as levels of ketone body utilizing and transporting proteins, which was also accompanied by increased concentrations of ketone bodies in this brain structure. These effects can be unrelated, but in light of the growing body of evidence showing that exogenous BHB administration induces autophagy in vitro (Finn and Dice, 2005; Camberos-Luna et al., 2016) and improves autophagic flux in brain cells in vivo (Torres-Esquivel et al., 2020), it can be hypothesized that the level of autophagy depends on the local ketone body concentration.",d0c67762-fd87-4826-a739-63a5894eff24
41,discussion9," On the other hand, it has been shown that autophagy is essential for hepatic and renal ketogenesis during starvation, therefore we cannot exclude the possibility that the relationship between these processes is opposite. The possibility of the existence of extrahepatic ketogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS) has been recently raised (Puchalska and Crawford, 2017). It was demonstrated that astrocytes are capable of synthesizing ketones (Le Foll et al., 2014; Non-aka et al., 2016) especially in response to caprylic acid . HMGCS2, hydroxymethyl 3 methylglutaryl CoA lyase (HMGCL), and BDH1 are crucial enzymes for ketogenesis. It should be mentioned here that there is inconsistent data regarding HMGCS2 expression in the nervous tissue. While some authors showed a lack of expression of HMGCS2 in astrocytes and neurons , the latest studies confirm the astrocytic expression of HMGCS mRNA .",1767a353-13fb-48de-a63e-9f7b26753803
42,discussion10," HMGCS has been found to be abundantly expressed in the astrocytes of the optic nerve  and other glial cells  and various brain areas , including the hippocampus . Moreover, HMGCS2 has been defined as an autophagy regulator , which raises the role of ketone metabolism as an autophagy enhancer. We observed that the level of the ketogenic proteins was elevated in the hippocampus especially in plant-fat enriched ketogenic diets. The hippocampus is more enriched with astrocytes than the cerebral cortex , which may contribute to the stronger response of the hippocampus to nutritional ketosis. Taken together, these observations urge us to make a bold hypothesis: That brain ketogenesis can be launched during a ketogenic diet in vivo.",9c201da2-de86-4f60-9088-cb9ace5e98e2
43,discussion11," Further studies including in vitro neural and glial cells as well as organotypic cultures of different brain areas would bring more precise data allowing to mechanistically establish the existence of the brain ketogenesis as well as the dependency between local ketone body metabolism and autophagy. The lack of mechanistic experiments, without which we remain far away from making a final statement on the occurrence of these phenomena under nutritional ketosis, may be considered a limitation of the present study.
