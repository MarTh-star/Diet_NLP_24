0,introduction0," Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory and multifaceted disease. This condition affects approximately 2–3% of the world’s population1 and is less common in children than in adults. Psoriasis is associated with morbidity and mortality.2 Generally, significant differences among individuals from various ethnic groups and geographical location have been recorded, with an increased incidence in individuals living at high latitudes.3 From a sex viewpoint, some studies reported differences between males and females.4,5 Patients with psoriasis have a decreased quality of life,6 with anxiety and depression. Psoriasis is a disorder of multifactorial etiology with both genetic and trigging factors. Numerous studies have reported the identification of genetic loci, in particular, 10 loci as susceptibility regions. The factors identified as triggers for the development of psoriasis are trauma, obesity, infections, medications, sunlight, stress, alcohol, smoking, and endocrine factors.",9002541c-76cf-4e46-9476-e8af26f73a42
1,introduction1,"7  Histologically, this disease is characterized by hyperproliferative keratinocytes and the infiltration of prominent T cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils in the dermis. The diagnosis is usually clinical, including an examination of the primary lesion and affected areas. General presentations include plaque, inverse, guttate, erythrodermic, and pustular forms, with cutaneous manifestations and nail, scalp, and joint abnormalities. The psoriasis area and severity index (psoriasis area and severity index (PASI)), body surface area (body surface area (BSA)), and dermatology life quality index (dermatology life quality index (DLQI)) are tools that are commonly used for the classification of plaque psoriasis.8  A systematic review and meta-analysis summarize the epidemiological association between psoriasis and obesity, indicating a higher prevalence and incidence of obesity in psoriasis patients, compared with the general population.",8df78a3e-9f50-4630-975b-32cee81f5990
2,introduction2,"9−11 Moreover, numerous studies have reported evidence of a causal relationship between obesity and psoriasis, investigating the connection between body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and psoriasis.10,12,13  A few studies of weight-loss interventions have been shown to improve psoriasis and to increase the response to treatment,12 especially adherence to a low-calorie dietary regimen.14−17 Fatty tissue is an active endocrine tissue and causes a pro-inflammatory state in obese patients.18 The clinical effect of weight loss is the reduction of adipose tissue as a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines. From this perspective, a very-low-calorie diet with adequate protein content is responsible for weight loss and the reduction of visceral fat mass.19−22  The ketogenic diet is a nutritional regimen characterized by a reduction in carbohydrates and a relative increase in protein and fat.",c8375519-ceb3-4588-b3a1-aae6607fb096

4,introduction4," Nuclear magnetic resonance (Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)) spectroscopy represents a robust and suitable technique for metabolomic approaches: low-molecular-mass compounds can be concurrently qualitatively and quantitatively detected in biological samples.31 In this novel study, we performed an Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomic analysis of the sera of psoriasis patients subjected to a ketogenic nutritional regimen for 4 weeks. Metabolomic data analyzed with the aid of univariate and multivariate statistical methods were correlated with the biochemical and clinical parameters, including IL-2 and IL-1β cytokines. Metabolomic profiles of psoriasis patients compared to those of healthy controls before and after a 4 week ketogenic diet provide preliminary indications to identify candidate biomarkers useful in the theranostic control of psoriasis.",a6c05f13-683e-4d65-801e-6ca1c170d0f2

The participants met a study dietician every week to verify food intake and adherence to administered dietary intervention. During group meetings, the diet regimen was given to subjects with encouragement and instructions for the use of dietary supplements. Treatment efficacy was assessed at baseline (T0) and after 4 weeks (T1). The control group (healthy controls) adopted a conventional diet and was instructed to eat ordinary food according to the national guidelines for a healthy diet.",5f307acc-5ef3-4d50-8b69-8f1ac8c6a749

14,methods8," All treatments with hypoglycemic agents and diuretics were interrupted.  Outcomes (Primary and Secondary)  The primary outcome was psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), an index of psoriasis severity: the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) was measured at baseline (T0) and at 4 weeks (T1), along with body surface area (BSA) assessment. The secondary outcome was dermatology life quality index (DLQI) to determine the quality of life, the reduction in body surface area (BSA), the improvement in itch severity, and weight loss.  Sample Pretreatment for Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Analysis  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) sample preparation and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra acquisition were performed as previously reported.31,33 To obtain the blood serum, the whole blood was collected into tubes not containing anticoagulant and allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 to 120 min.",eea4d9d1-465a-4e2e-8cd5-7e48b74f6ba1
15,methods9," After centrifugation at 12,000 g, the blood serum was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C in Greiner cryogenic vials before Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measurements. Before being transferred to a 5 mm heavy-walled Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tube, samples were thawed at room temperature. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) samples were prepared by mixing 300 μL of blood sera with 200 μL of phosphate buffer, including 0.075 M Na2HPO4·7H2O, 4% NaN3, and H2O. Trimethylsilyl propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid, sodium salt (0.1% TSP in D2O) was used as an internal reference for the alignment and quantification of Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals; the mixture, homogenized by vortexing for 30 s, was transferred to a 5 mm Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tube (Bruker Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tubes) before analysis started.",dab9c575-4425-4b23-9058-ace750ec666a
16,methods10,"31  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Data Acquisition  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were carried out on a Bruker DRX600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a 5 mm triple-resonance z-gradient CryoProbe. TOPSPIN, version 3.0, was used for spectrometer control and data processing (Bruker Biospin, Fällanden, Switzerland). For nonfiltered biofluids, low-mass metabolites coexist with high-mass biomolecules, such as lipids, proteins, and lipoproteins; therefore, to selectively observe small-molecule components in solutions, Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG)) experiments were performed. 1D 1H pulse-sequence Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) experiments comprised a spectral width of 7 kHz, 32,000 data points, water presaturation applied over 3.5 s of relaxation delay, and a spin-echo delay of 80 ms.34 The pulse sequence used included an excitation sculpting routine for the suppression of the water signal.",9c95ccde-10ae-46fc-b786-8157dd3ddbf5
17,methods11,"35 Due to the effect of excitation sculpting on the signal height of resonances in the region close to the water resonance,36,37 the metabolites that have resonances close to this region (ascorbate, glucose, mannose, and pyroglutamate) were quantified using resonances from those metabolites in other spectral regions. A weighted Fourier transform was applied to the time domain data with a 0.5 Hz line-broadening followed by a manual phase and baseline correction in preparation for targeted profiling analysis.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Data Processing  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were manually phased and baseline-corrected. The quantification of serum metabolites was achieved using Chenomx Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-Suite v8.0 (Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, Canada).",48aba6ec-6164-4964-a46e-6e6e01f62038

A comparison of the spectral data obtained for each serum sample with the Chenomx metabolite library results in a list of compounds together with their respective concentrations based on the known concentration of the added internal reference compound TSP-d4 (5.8 mM).  Statistical Analysis  Multivariate statistical analysis, principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)), and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were conducted with normalized metabolomics data using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/).",a8af4cf5-3119-483b-a467-a4becd7aa2fc

Cytokine Analysis: enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  Serum concentrations of the cytokines IL-2, IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-4 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) commercial kits (Diaclone SAS (Besançon Cedex, France)) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All tests were performed in duplicate. The ranges of the sensitivity standard curve of the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were 31.2–1000 pg/mL for IL-2, 15.6–500 pg/mL for IL-1β, 25–800 pg/mL for TNF-α, 12.5–400 pg/mL for IFN-γ, and 1.1–35 pg/mL for IL-4.

The samples in the multiwell plate were mixed by repeated aspirations and ejections, taking care not to scratch the inner surfaces. Freeze-dried control vials were also reconstituted with the most appropriate standard diluent to the sample to gain a solution at the concentration stated on the vial. Biotinylated anticytokines, biotinylated secondary antibody, and streptavidin-HRP were also prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The absorbance value of each well was read on a Thermo Scientific Multiskan GO spectrophotometer using 450 nm as the primary wavelength and 620 nm as the reference wavelength (610 to 650 nm is acceptable).

22,results0, Clinical Analysis  Clinical data for 30 patients with psoriasis before and after the ketogenic diet were statistically analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test to assess their significance and P value. The variable influence on projection (VIP) score was calculated using the R package to identify the variables that discriminated between the two groups. The variables with variable influence on projection (VIP) scores >1 were considered significant for the analysis.

24,results2,"45,46 Clinical data identified by the variable influence on projection (VIP) score also included several biochemical and clinical parameters derived from blood analysis. In particular, the concentrations of folic acid, vitamin B12, aminotransferase (AST), cortisol, calcium, and direct bilirubin were higher in patients at T1 than at T0. low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and HOMA-IR levels were lower in patients at T1 than at T0 (see Table 2).  Quantitative Analysis  To quantitatively evaluate the 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the serum of participants at T0 in comparison to the Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the serum of the same participants at T1, the PRincipal COmponent Normalization Algorithm (PRincipal COmponent Normalization Algorithm (PRICONA)) and normalization strategy were applied.",5f86b39b-e00c-47f0-a5e6-5a79df84d298
25,results3," The PRincipal COmponent Normalization Algorithm (PRICONA) and normalization strategy are based on the assumption that, since concentration differences result in proportional variations of spectral intensities, nonproportional changes most likely can be attributed to the effects of the disease. The proportional variations are described by the normalization factor R, which must be calculated to compare the intensities of the T0 and T1 signals. When the first principal component (PC) explains the major part of the variance of a spectral data set, it represents the function shape of the sum of a group of proportional peaks (normalization set), and its scores represent the proportionality constants (normalization constants). Once the spectra are normalized, peak intensities can be directly compared. According to the normalization procedure described above, signals that showed significant variations were quantified.",6e15fb5c-7b84-445c-9302-a69ace39af00
26,results4," At the same time, an opportune strategy based on the PRincipal COmponent Normalization Algorithm (PRICONA) is performed to achieve a reliable Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic analysis. The normalization algorithm is based on principal component analysis (PCA) with some advantages: it allows simultaneous normalization of data sets of spectra by identifying signals affected by the agent (in this case, after the diet regimen) and quantitative measurement of variations. In this way, the differences in peak intensities are excluded, and the real differences do not depend on differences in sample concentration. All extraneous sample-to-sample variations and those within each metabolite are removed. After spectral normalization, all differences related to metabolites can be used to identify potential candidate biomarkers.",3ff6b7be-3fb9-456b-9c34-a5b8ed1d82f3

36,results16," In addition, the comparison between psoriasis patients at T0 and psoriasis patients at T1 highlighted the involvement of pathways related to ketogenic diet, in particular, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies and butanoate metabolism, which are not disregulated in comparison with previous clusters. Also, in the comparison between psoriasis patients at T0 psoriatic patients at T1, there is an amino acid dysmetabolism related to glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; arginine and proline metabolism; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation and biosynthesis.  In enrichment analysis, by increasing the number of reference metabolites and evaluating concentrations of metabolites present in our matrix, it is possible to identify a change in the metabolome of psoriasis patients before and after the diet regimen.",179d946a-6016-4209-80a7-59ab2851e689
37,results17," All dysmetabolism identified in the pathway analysis was confirmed by the enrichment analysis (see Table S4, Supporting Information). The graph in Figure 6 shows the pathways that best discriminate between the two classes (T0 and T1). In particular, in the pathway of fatty acids, there is a physiological variation of the ketone bodies related to the ketogenic diet, with an increase of 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetic acid in the serum of patients after 4 weeks. Choline pathways (phospholipid biosynthesis and phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis) indicated a reduction in serum choline levels of patients with post-diet psoriasis.52 Amino acid dysmetabolism was confirmed by a change in l-leucine, l-isoleucine, and l-valine levels, which decreased after the diet,53 and by the dysfunction of the urea cycle.53  Figure 6 Pathway enrichment analysis: the pathways related to a P value that excludes randomness and is correlated with psoriasis.",8624c433-c340-4a0f-b2b4-1190befd3a0f

39,results19,"10,12,13  To assess the benefits of ketogenic diet for patients with psoriasis, the average of the concentrations of metabolites with variable influence on projection (VIP) score > 1 was calculated in the following groups: (i) healthy controls, (ii) patients with psoriasis at T0 (before the ketogenic diet), and (iii) patients with psoriasis at T1 (after 4 weeks of diet). Table 4 shows the average metabolite values for each cluster and the difference between the metabolite’s mean concentration of healthy controls and patients before and after the diet. Analysis of the data shown in Table 4 indicates that the mean concentration difference of the metabolites in the patients vs controls at T1 is lower than the mean concentration difference in the patients vs controls at T0. The metabolites formate, l-histidine, methionine, l-arginine, choline, l-ornithine, pyruvic acid, and l-alanine are the most discriminant.",587616f7-045d-4672-a76b-b4075c5757ce

41,discussion0," In the present study, we evaluated the effect of a ketogenic diet on psoriasis disease progression. Thirty psoriasis patients were subjected to a ketogenic nutritional regimen and monitored by evaluating (i) the clinical symptoms, (ii) the blood biochemical parameters, including IL-2, IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-4, and (iii) the metabolomic profile, as derived from 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. As a preliminary step, we identified the psoriatic patients’ metabolomic profile and the healthy controls’ metabolomic profile.1 Based on preliminary data previously obtained in our laboratory and for reasons related to the restrictions imposed from the nutritional regimen, the patients were subjected to 4 week treatment. As the parallel evaluation of ketogenic diet effects in psoriatic and healthy subjects was not possible, we considered the healthy controls’ metabolomic profile as our experimental control.",39854bd4-611e-473b-b7e0-826a20fa73e3
42,discussion1," By following the indications of the Italian Society of Endocrinology (Italian Society of Endocrinology (ISE)),56 the enrollment of healthy subjects for the low-calorie ketogenic nutritional regimen is not recommended as the low-calorie ketogenic diet causes alteration of the metabolic profile in healthy subjects, with potentially harmful implications in blood pH equilibrium, calcium homeostasis, and lean mass balance. Therefore, we considered the therapeutic effect of ketogenic diets by comparing the metabolomic profile of psoriatic patients at T1 with healthy subjects’ metabolomic profile at T0.  Data resulting from the clinical evaluation showed caloric restriction-induced psoriasis disease regression after 4 weeks with a significant reduction in the dermatology life quality index (DLQI), psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), visual analogue scale (VAS) pain, and visual analogue scale (VAS) pruritus clinical scores (P < 0.05).",bbccb1fe-9269-428e-88ca-b538903aebd3
43,discussion2," In particular, the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) showed a reduction of approximately 50%.  Biochemical and clinical parameters indicated a general improvement in the metabolites’ concentration known to be related to the condition of psoriasis:57 folic acid, vitamin B12, calcium, bilirubin, cortisol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and total cholesterol. High levels of folic acid and vitamin B12 are known to improve the pathological condition related to psoriasis.57 As reported in Table 2, our data indicated low levels of folic acid and vitamin B12 at T0, whereas an increase in the concentration was registered at T1. Hypocalcemia was observed as a risk factor in psoriasis.58 Our data show an increase in calcium levels in subjects after the ketogenic diet. Bilirubin, an essential antioxidant metabolite, was present in low concentrations in subjects with psoriasis;59 after our diet regimen, bilirubin concentration increased.",0453d5c3-87bb-4af6-99ac-9f42d668f7a1
44,discussion3," Significant variation was observed in the concentrations of cortisol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and total cholesterol. Recent scientific studies assert that low cortisol levels are related to high stress levels in subjects with psoriasis.60 According to the dermatology life quality index (DLQI), investigating the quality of life in subjects with psoriasis, cortisol levels following a low-calorie ketogenic diet increased.  The ketogenic diet resulted in weight loss at T1, corresponding to ∼10% of the initial body weight. Other significant modifications of anthropometric measurements were waist circumference and hip circumference (see Table S6, Supporting Information). The weight loss was associated with a significant increase in ketone bodies at T1, as shown in the Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomic analysis. This effect was the main physiological effect of the ketogenic diet.",76958b7b-9bd0-403c-9ed7-aaa8c6df66be
45,discussion4," The basic principle of the low-calorie ketogenic diet is to limit the availability of carbohydrates, forcing the consumption of fats as the primary energy source, with a resulting increase in fatty acids, ketone bodies, and pyruvic acid. However, weight loss and the increase in ketone bodies were not associated with any alteration of those biochemical parameters that initially were in the average concentration range, thus proving the safety of the proposed dietary intervention.  In contrast, biochemical and clinical parameters previously found in abnormal concentrations and related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, such as glucose, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), Apo A1 and B, aminotransferase (AST), γGT, insulin, and HOMA-I, returned to healthy average ranges (see Table S6, Supporting Information). A decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL) was also observed due to the drop in total cholesterol (from 52.07 ± 18.23 to 44.20 ± 14.22 mg/dL; P = 0.079).",5a0f3578-c612-4750-820b-493958bbde9c
46,discussion5," Last, the reduction in the aortomesenteric fat thickness (aortomesenteric fat thickness (AMFT)) proved a substantial decrease in visceral adipose tissue (VAT).  The ketogenic nutritional regimen aims to minimize insulin levels and to increase GH secretion. The final effect is the almost complete reduction of the visceral adipose tissue responsible for insulin resistance and the insurgence of inflammatory status. Insulin and estrogen act at the PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) level by activating the transcriptase for adipogenesis. Conversely, GH phosphorylates PPAR and inhibits adipogenesis. As a result, reduced insulin concentration favors a lipolytic route with the mobilization of visceral localized fat deposits.61−63  Earlier scientific studies have identified lactic acid as a possible biomarker of psoriasis.",232bebea-ad7c-41bc-848f-3b61acefec03
47,discussion6,"53,64 Confirming this evidence, the variable influence on projection (VIP) analysis (Figure 3) indicated increased lactic acid concentration in psoriatic patients. On the contrary, the concentrations of lactic acid and l-isoleucine, although decreasing, do not fall into the physiological range of healthy subjects, perhaps due to the short-term treatment.  The confirmation that the ketogenic diet induces a correction of the dysmetabolic condition related to psoriasis disease results from the Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics study performed on psoriasis patients’ blood sera. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics data on the patient sera collected before the diet indicated abnormal concentrations of metabolites that are related to the condition of psoriasis,65 and these concentrations were found in the ranges of the healthy controls at T1, suggesting a rebalancing of the metabolome after the ketogenic regimen.",fd1f216b-9617-498b-b7c0-d5c56e6b3f35
48,discussion7,"65  Abnormally high concentrations of l-alanine and l-leucine and a lower concentration of l-glutamine were previously identified as biomarkers of psoriasis.53 variable influence on projection (VIP) score analysis based on the multivariate statistical analysis of the Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics data shows a decrease in l-leucine and l-alanine and an increase in glutamine and glutamate at T1.  Moreover, significant variations in l-arginine, l-phenylalanine, l-aspartic acid, and l-proline concentrations at T1 were also observable.53 An interpretation of these metabolic changes according to the pathway and enrichment analysis (Figures 6 and 7) indicated that the regression of psoriasis was related to the correction of amino acid metabolic pathways, in particular, those of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; arginine and proline metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation; valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis; and tyrosine metabolism.",012dbabb-94d4-4c61-a22f-4a44c2e79f91
49,discussion8," Therefore, these data, considered from a pathognomonic perspective, suggest that important modifications in amino acid and glycolysis pathways for psoriasis patients are ascribed to an increase in amino acid and energy demand for protein biosynthesis and keratinocyte hyperproliferation.53  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics data showed that choline levels were decreased in psoriasis patients at T1 compared to T0. The decrease in choline and nicotine concentrations is additional evidence that the regression of psoriasis corresponds to the regression of the inflammatory process: previous data showed high choline and nicotine levels in psoriasis patients due to mast cell degranulation.52  Additionally, we measured the concentration of the cytokines IL-4, TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-2, and IL-1β that are considered markers of inflammatory status.",74acbe3a-ddf7-466c-a445-80503e70fffb
50,discussion9," In agreement with previous scientific studies pointing to altered interleukin serum concentrations in psoriasis patients,66,67 we found decreased IL-2 and IL-1β concentrations at T1 compared to T052,53 (Figure 3). The concentrations of IL-4, TNF-α, and INF-γ were not significantly decreased, probably due to the insufficient 4 week period to induce a significant variation of pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations.  Conclusions  Taken together, our data suggest that a low-calorie ketogenic diet can be considered a successful strategy and therapeutic option for the management of psoriasis. IL-2 and IL-1β, together with the concentrations of leucine, alanine, glutamine, glutamate, and choline, can be considered promising biomarkers for the early diagnosis and correct prognosis of psoriasis patients.
