0,background0,"Emerging evidence supports the therapeutic potential of the ketogenic diet (KD) for a variety of disease states, leading investigators to research methods of harnessing the benefits of nutritional ketosis without the dietary restrictions. The KD has been used as an effective non-pharmacological therapy for pediatric intractable seizures since the 1920s [1–3]. In addition to epilepsy, the ketogenic diet has elicited significant therapeutic effects for weight loss and type-2 diabetes (T2D) [4]. Several studies have shown significant weight loss on a high fat, low carbohydrate diet without significant elevations of serum cholesterol [5–12]. Another study demonstrated the safety and benefits of long-term application of the KD in T2D patients. Patients exhibited significant weight loss, reduction of blood glucose, and improvement of lipid markers after eating a well-formulated KD for 56 weeks [13].",e32173f3-441c-45ba-9f56-d05fd6f1df99
1,background1," Recently, researchers have begun to investigate the use of the KD as a treatment for acne, polycystic ovary syndrome (polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)), cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)), traumatic brain injury (traumatic brain injury (TBI)) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with promising preliminary results [14–26].  The classical KD consists of a 4:1 ratio of fat to protein and carbohydrate, with 80–90 % of total calories derived from fat [27]. The macronutrient ratio of the KD induces a metabolic shift towards fatty acid oxidation and hepatic ketogenesis, elevating the ketone bodies acetoacetate (AcAc) and β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) in the blood. Acetone, generated by decarboxylation of AcAc, has been shown to have anticonvulsant properties [28–32].",52f40362-f3b7-4c0d-be69-01c2e537823a
2,background2," Ketone bodies are naturally elevated to serve as alternative metabolic substrates for extra-hepatic tissues during the prolonged reduction of glucose availability, suppression of insulin, and depletion of liver glycogen, such as occurs during starvation, fasting, vigorous exercise, calorie restriction, or the KD. Although the KD has clear therapeutic potential, several factors limit the efficacy and utility of this metabolic therapy for widespread clinical use. Patient compliance to the KD can be low due to the severe dietary restriction - the diet being generally perceived as unpalatable - and intolerance to high-fat ingestion. Maintaining ketosis can be difficult as consumption of even a small quantity of carbohydrates or excess protein can rapidly inhibit ketogenesis [33, 34].",3a6c71cb-0b15-4b37-90b5-e7efe48a7b3b
3,background3," Furthermore, enhanced ketone body production and tissue utilization by the tissues can take several weeks (keto-adaptation), and patients may experience mild hypoglycemic symptoms during this transitional period [35].  Recent studies suggest that many of the benefits of the KD are due to the effects of ketone body metabolism. Interestingly, in studies on T2D patients, improved glycemic control, improved lipid markers, and retraction of insulin and other medications occurred before weight loss became significant. Both βHB and AcAc have been shown to decrease mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) production [36–39]. Veech et al. have summarized the potential therapeutic uses for ketone bodies [28, 40]. They have demonstrated that exogenous ketones favorably alter mitochondrial bioenergetics to reduce the mitochondrial NAD couple, oxidize the co-enzyme Q, and increase the ΔG’ (free enthalpy) of ATP hydrolysis [41].",3feeb4e8-62ab-431e-968c-4ca39baea0da
4,background4," Ketone bodies have been shown to increase the hydraulic efficiency of the heart by 28 %, simultaneously decreasing oxygen consumption while increasing ATP production [42]. Thus, elevated ketone bodies increase metabolic efficiency and as a consequence, reduce superoxide production and increase reduced glutathione [28]. Sullivan et al. demonstrated that mice fed a KD for 10–12 days showed increased hippocampal uncoupling proteins, indicative of decreased mitochondrial-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) [43]. Bough et al. showed an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in rats maintained on a KD for 4–6 weeks [44, 45]. Recently, Shimazu et al. reported that βHB is an exogenous and specific inhibitor of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), which confers protection against oxidative stress [38]. Ketone bodies have also been shown to suppress inflammation by decreasing the inflammatory markers TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, E-selectin, I-CAM, and PAI-1 [8, 46, 47].",35e43f15-a313-4115-92d9-d9966a56d483
5,background5," Therefore, it is thought that ketone bodies themselves confer many of the benefits associated with the KD.  Considering both the broad therapeutic potential and limitations of the KD, an oral exogenous ketone supplement capable of inducing sustained therapeutic ketosis without the need for dietary restriction would serve as a practical alternative. Several natural and synthetic ketone supplements capable of inducing nutritional ketosis have been identified. Desrochers et al. elevated ketone bodies in the blood of pigs (>0.5 mM) using exogenous ketone supplements: (R, S)-1,3 butanediol and (R, S)-1,3 butanediol-acetoacetate monoesters and diester [48]. In 2012, Clarke et al. demonstrated the safety and efficacy of chronic oral administration of a ketone monoester of R-βHB in rats and humans [49, 50].",274cd273-34cb-4007-a38d-7095885d5140
6,background6," Subjects maintained elevated blood ketones without dietary restriction and experienced little to no adverse side effects, demonstrating the potential to circumvent the restrictive diet typically needed to achieve therapeutic ketosis. We hypothesized that exogenous ketone supplements could produce sustained hyperketonemia (>0.5 mM) without dietary restriction and without negatively influencing metabolic biomarkers, such as blood glucose, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), Low density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides.",ccf47c55-ee59-46d5-bb45-1b3feed29090
7,background7," Thus, we measured these biomarkers during a 28-day administration of the following ketone supplements in rats: naturally-derived ketogenic supplements included medium chain triglyceride oil (medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT)), sodium/potassium -βHB mineral salt (butanediol (BD) a sodium/potassium β hydroxybutyrate (βHB) mineral salt (BMS)), and sodium/potassium -βHB mineral salt + medium chain triglyceride oil 1:1 mixture (butanediol (BD) a sodium/potassium β hydroxybutyrate (βHB) mineral salt (BMS) + medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT)) and synthetically produced ketogenic supplements included 1, 3-butanediol (BD), 1, 3-butanediol acetoacetate diester/ ketone ester (KE).

The notion that we can produce the therapeutic effects of the KD with exogenous ketone supplementation is supported by our previous study which demonstrated that acutely administered KE supplementation delays central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)) oxygen toxicity seizures without the need for dietary restriction [29].

30,discussion1,"  Ketone supplementation causes little to no change in triglycerides and lipoproteins One common concern regarding the KD is its purported potential to increase the risk of atherosclerosis by elevating blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels [55, 56]. This topic remains controversial as some, but not all, studies have demonstrated that the KD elevates blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides [57–62]. Kwitervich and colleagues demonstrated an increase in low-density lipoprotein (Low density lipoprotein (LDL)) and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) in epileptic children fed the classical KD for two years [27]. In this study, total cholesterol increased by ~130 %, and stabilized at the elevated level over the 2-year period. A similar study demonstrated that the lipid profile returned to baseline in children who remained on the KD for six years [63].",9a23a8b8-7559-46a5-b89e-b81eadaa3e26
31,discussion2," Children typically remain on the diet for approximately two years then return to a diet of common fat and carbohydrate ingestion [64]. The implications of these findings are unclear, since the influence of cholesterol on cardiovascular health is controversial and macronutrient sources of the diet vary per study. In contrast to these studies, the majority of recent studies have suggested that the KD can actually lead to significant benefits in biomarkers of metabolic health, including blood lipid profiles [65–72]. In these studies, the KD positively altered blood lipids, decreasing total triglycerides and cholesterol while increasing the ratio of high density lipoprotein (HDL) to Low density lipoprotein (LDL) [68–77]. Although, the KD is well-established in children, it has only recently been utilized as a strategy to control seizures in adults.",e67f81d7-c4d4-40fe-a9f7-44f8bf94cb61
32,discussion3," In 2014, Schoeler and colleagues reported on the feasibility of the KD for adults, concluding that 39 % of individuals achieved > 50 % reduction in seizure frequency, similar to the results reported in pediatric studies. Patients experienced similar gastrointestinal adverse advents that have been previously described in pediatric patients, but they did not lead to discontinuation of the diet in any patient [78].  With oral ketone supplementation, we observed a significant elevation in blood βHB without dietary restriction and with little change in lipid biomarkers (Fig. 1). Over the 4 week study, medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT)-supplemented rats demonstrated decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL) compared to controls. No significant changes were observed in any of the triglycerides or lipoproteins (high density lipoprotein (HDL), Low density lipoprotein (LDL)) with any of the remaining exogenously applied ketone supplements.",68a43272-5dab-4665-a845-9fa74d45e3f1
33,discussion4," It should be noted that the rats used for this study had not yet reached full adult body size [79]. Their normal growth rate and maturation was likely responsible for the changes in triglyceride and lipoprotein levels observed in the control animals over the 4 week study (baseline data not shown, no significant differences) [80, 81]. Future studies are needed to investigate the effect of ketone supplementation on fully mature and aged animals. Overall, our study suggests that oral ketone supplementation has little effect on the triglyceride or lipoprotein profile after 4 weeks. However, it is currently unknown if ketone supplementation would affect lipid biomarkers after a longer duration of consumption. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of ketone supplements on blood triglyceride and lipoproteins after chronic administration and as a means to further enhance the hyperketonemia and improve the lipid profile of the clinically implemented (4:1) KD.",e08315a7-14cd-408e-92cf-6484089a4e3a
34,discussion5,"  Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is the lipoprotein particle that is most often associated with atherosclerosis. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles exist in different sizes: large molecules (Pattern A) or small molecules (Pattern B). Recent studies have investigated the importance of Low density lipoprotein (LDL)-particle type and size rather than total concentration as being the source for cardiovascular risk [56]. Patients whose Low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles are predominantly small and dense (Pattern B) have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)). It is thought that small, dense Low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles are more able to penetrate the endothelium and cause in damage and inflammation [82–85]. Volek et al. reported that the KD increased the pattern and volume of Low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which is considered to reduce cardiovascular risk [73].",f93d7802-d28b-4d46-9c7f-2f843e7335cf
35,discussion6," Though we did not show a significant effect on Low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels for ketone supplements, future chronic feeding studies will investigate the effects of ketone supplementation on lipidomic profile and Low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle type and size.  Therapeutic levels of hyperketonemia suppress blood glucose levels We demonstrated that therapeutic ketosis could be induced without dietary (calorie or carbohydrate) restriction and that this acute elevation in blood ketones was significantly correlated with a reduction in blood glucose (Figs. 2, 3 and 4). The butanediol (BD) a sodium/potassium β hydroxybutyrate (βHB) mineral salt (BMS) ketone supplement did not significantly induce blood hyperketonemia or reduced glucose in the rats. The KE supplemented rats trended towards reduced glucose levels; however, the lower dose of this agent did not lower glucose significantly, as reported previously in acute response of mice [59].",a58e45d6-322c-4006-8f71-024af49611d0
36,discussion7," medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT)s have previously been shown to elicit a slight hypoglycemic effect by enhancing glucose utilization in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients [86–88]. Kashiwaya et al. demonstrated that both blood glucose and blood insulin decreased by approximately 50 % in rats fed a diet where 30 % of calories from starch were replaced with ketone esters for 14 days, suggesting that ketone supplementation increases insulin sensitivity or reduced hepatic glucose output [89]. This ketone-induced hypoglycemic effect has been previously reported in humans with IV infusions of ketone bodies [90, 91]. Recently, Mikkelsen et al. showed that a small increase in βHB concentration decreases glucose production by 14 % in post-absorptive health males [92]. However, this has not been previously reported with any of the oral exogenous ketone supplements we studied.",bfbae58b-ffa6-4804-9d16-302a77dbc565
37,discussion8," Ketones are an efficient and sufficient energy substrate for the brain, and will therefore prevent side effects of hypoglycemia when blood levels are elevated and the patient is keto-adapted. This was most famously demonstrated by Owen et al. in 1967 wherein keto-adapted patients (starvation induced therapeutic ketosis) were given 20 IU of insulin. The blood glucose of fasted patients dropped to 1–2 mM, but they exhibited no hypoglycemic symptoms due to brain utilization of ketones for energy [93]. Therefore, ketones maintain brain metabolism and are neuroprotective during severe hypoglycemia. The rats in the medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) group had a correlation of blood ketone and glucose levels at week 4, whereas the combination of butanediol (BD) a sodium/potassium β hydroxybutyrate (βHB) mineral salt (BMS) + medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) produced a significant hypoglycemic correlation both at baseline and at week 4.",1e71a5ed-a950-4717-ac58-acdfae272664
38,discussion9," No hypoglycemic symptoms were observed in the rats during this study. Insulin levels were not measured in this study; however, future ketone supplementation studies should measure the effects of exogenous ketones on insulin sensitivity with a glucose tolerance test. An increase in insulin sensitivity in combination with our observed hypoglycemic effect has potential therapy implications for glycemic control in T2D [40]. Furthermore, it should be noted that the KE metabolizes to both AcAc and βHB in 1:1 ratio [29]. The ketone monitor used in this study only measures βHB as levels of AcAc are more difficult to measure due to spontaneous decarboxylation to acetone; therefore, the total ketone levels (βHB + AcAc) measured were likely higher, specifically for the KE [14].",86e40368-f597-4217-9be1-eb401bfdd14a
39,discussion10," Interestingly, the 10 g/kg dose produced a delayed blood βHB peak for ketone supplements medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) and butanediol (BD) a sodium/potassium β hydroxybutyrate (βHB) mineral salt (BMS) + medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT). The higher dose of the ketogenic supplements elevated blood levels more substantially, and thus reached their maximum blood concentration later due to prolonged metabolic clearance. It must be noted that the dosage used in this study does not translate to human patients, since the metabolic physiology of rats is considerably higher. Future studies will be needed to determine optimal dosing for human patients.  Effects of ketone supplementation on organ weight and body weight percentage Ketone supplementation did not affect the size of the brain, lungs, kidneys or heart of rats.",32fba41e-2785-4716-94a9-ffc578f000a7
40,discussion11," As previously mentioned, the rats were still growing during the experimental time frame; therefore, organ weights were normalized to body weight to determine if organ weight changed independently to growth. There could be several reasons why ketones influenced liver and spleen weight. The ratio of liver to body weight was significantly higher in the medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) supplemented animals (Fig. 5). medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT)s are readily absorbed in the intestinal lumen and transported directly to the liver via hepatic portal circulation. When given a large bolus, such as in this study, the amount of medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT)s in the liver will likely exceed the β-oxidation rate, causing the medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT)s to be deposited in the liver as fat droplets [94].",d34b85bc-d1ee-4c86-99ce-524a77e8a055
41,discussion12," The accumulated medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) droplets in the liver could explain the higher liver weight to body weight percentage observed with medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) supplemented rats. Future toxicology and histological studies will be needed to determine the cause of the observed hepatomegaly. It should be emphasized that the dose in this study is not optimized in humans. We speculate that an optimized human dose would be lower and may not cause hepatomegaly or potential fat accumulation. Nutritional ketosis achieved with the KD has been shown to decrease inflammatory markers such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, E-selectin, I-CAM, and PAI-1 [8, 46], which may account for the observed decrease in spleen weight. As previously mentioned, Veech and colleagues demonstrated that exogenous supplementation of 5 mM βHB resulted in a 28 % increase in hydraulic work in the working perfused rat heart and a significant decrease in oxygen consumption [28, 41, 42].",19debb54-fd96-4856-a51d-3f6e39d7915b
42,discussion13," Ketone bodies have been shown to increase cerebral blood flow and perfusion [95]. Also, ketone bodies have been shown to increase ATP synthesis and enhance the efficiency of ATP production [14, 28, 40]. It is possible that sustained ketosis results in enhanced cardiac efficiency and O2 consumption. Even though the size of the heart did not change for any of the ketone supplements, further analysis of tissues harvested from the ketone-supplemented rats will be needed to determine any morphological changes and to understand changes in organ size. It should be noted that the Harlan standard rodent chow 2018 is nutritionally complete and formulated with high-quality ingredients to optimize gestation, lactation, growth, and overall health of the animals. The same cannot be said for the standard American diet (standard American diet (SAD)).",497660d0-ae35-4144-9738-cf04350a9550
43,discussion14," Therefore, we plan to investigate the effects of ketone supplements administered with the standard American diet (SAD) to determine if similar effects will be seen when the micronutrient deficiencies and macronutrient profile mimics what most Americans consume.  medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) oil has recently been used to induce nutritional ketosis although it produces dose-dependent gastrointestinal (GI) side effects in humans that limit the potential for its use to significantly elevate ketones (>0.5 mM). Despite these limitations, Azzam and colleagues published a case report in which a 43-year-old-man had a significant decrease in seizure frequency after supplementing his diet with 4 tablespoons of medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) oil twice daily [96]. An attempt to increase his dosage to 5 tablespoons twice daily was halted by severe GI intolerance. Henderson et al.",043a43fb-4ba7-42a4-9276-59a90cecd8bb
44,discussion15," observed that 20 % of patients reported GI side effects with a 20 g dose of ketogenic agent AC-1202 in a double blind trial in mild to moderate Alzheimer’s patients [24]. We visually observed similar gastrointestinal side effects (loose stools) in the rats treated with medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) oil in our study. Rats were closely monitored to avoid dehydration, and gastric motility returned to normal between 12–24 h. Interestingly, the butanediol (BD) a sodium/potassium β hydroxybutyrate (βHB) mineral salt (BMS) + medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) supplement elevated βHB similarly to medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) oil alone, without causing the adverse gastrointestinal effects seen in medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT)-supplemented rats.",6ea200ad-3d18-48b5-b904-3b2672c95a00
45,discussion16," However, this could be due to the fact in a 10 g/kg dose of butanediol (BD) a sodium/potassium β hydroxybutyrate (βHB) mineral salt (BMS) + medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT), only 5 g/kg is medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) alone, which is less than the 10 g/kg dose that elicits the GI side effects. This suggests that this novel combination may provide a more useful therapeutic option than medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) oil alone, which is limited in its ability to elevate ketones in humans.  Exogenously delivered ketone supplements significantly altered rat weight gain for the duration of the study (Fig. 6). However, rats did not lose weight and maintained a healthy range for their age. Rats have been shown to effectively balance their caloric intake to prevent weight loss/gain [97–99].",b4ff595f-4545-43cd-956a-0f1f26c85817
46,discussion17," Due to the caloric density of the exogenous ketone supplements (Table 1) it is possible for the rats to eat less of the standard rodent chow and therefore less carbohydrates while maintaining their caloric intake. Food intake was not measured for this study. However, if there was a significant carbohydrate restriction there would be a signifcant change in basal blood ketone and blood glucose levels. As the hallmark to the KD, carbohydrate restriction increases blood ketone levels and reduces blood glucose levels. Neither an increase in basal blood ketone levels nor a decrease in basal blood glucose levels was observed in this study (Fig. 7). Additionally, if there were an overall blood glucose decrease due to a change in food intake, this would not explain the rapid reduction (within 30 min) in blood glucose correlated with an elevation of blood ketone levels after an intragastric bolus of ketone supplement (Figs. 2, 3 and 4).",3b285174-dc7c-487b-9725-c9dc5b6b0bab
47,discussion18,"  Conclusions Several studies have investigated the safety and efficacy of ketone supplements for disease states such as AD and Parkinson’s disease, and well as for parenteral nutrition [40, 48–50, 100–103]. Our research demonstrates that several forms of dietary ketone supplementation can effectively elevate blood ketone levels and achieve deleted: therapeutic nutritional ketosis without the need for dietary carbohydrate restriction. We also demonstrated that ketosis achieved with exogenous ketone supplementation can reduce blood glucose, and this is inversely associated with the blood ketone levels. Although preliminary results are encouraging, further studies are needed to determine if oral ketone supplementation can produce the same therapeutic benefits as the classic KD in the broad-spectrum of KD-responsive disease states . Additionally, further experiments need to be conducted to see if the exogenous ketone supplementation affects the same physiological features as the KD (i.e.",960ce9f9-fb99-4fc4-8e26-2bf87a6930c5
48,discussion19," reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammation, ATP production). Ketone supplementation could be used as an alternative method for inducing ketosis in patients uninterested in attempting the KD or those who have previously had difficulty implementing the KD because of palatability issues, gall bladder removal, liver abnormalities, or intolerance to fat. Additional experiments should be conducted to see if ketone supplementation could be used in conjunction with the KD to assist and ease the transition to nutrition ketosis and enhance the speed of keto-adaptation. In this study we have demonstrated the ability of several ketone supplements to elevate blood ketone levels, providing multiple options to induce therapeutic ketosis based on patient need. Though additional studies are needed to determine the therapeutic potential of ketone supplementation, many patients that previously were unable to benefit from the KD may now have an alternate method of achieving therapeutic ketosis.",d2b81a08-9d38-4b5c-9712-9041b2c16c22
