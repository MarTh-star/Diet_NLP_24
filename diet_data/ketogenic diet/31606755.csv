0,introduction0,"Epilepsy is a chronic disease characterized clinically by recurrent and unpredictable seizures  due to uncontrolled neuronal hyperactivity. A recent large-scale epidemiological survey of 196 countries and regions around the world found that there were 45.9 million people with epilepsy in 2016, with highest incidence in children aged 5 to 9 years . Severe status epilepticus or recurrent seizures can cause cognitive decline, impair quality of life, and increase the risks of injury and sudden death . The most common treatments for epilepsy are oral antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). However, about 30% of children are resistant to currently available AEDs (Pluta and Jablonski, 2011).",ccd3e271-196d-4af4-b471-6837b2aac76a
1,introduction1,"  The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high fat, low carbohydrate regime widely considered an effective non-drug treatment for epilepsy with documented anticonvulsant, antiepileptogenic, and neuroprotective effects on clinically refractory epilepsy and animal models of epilepsy (Lusardi et al., 2015; Simeone et al., 2018; Karimzadeh et al., 2019). Multiple therapeutic mechanisms have been proposed for KD-induced antiepileptogenesis, including increased adenosine and decreased DNA methylation, reduced mTORC1 activity, and blockade of histone deacetylases (Koene et al., 2019; Boison and Rho, 2020). Thus, it is critical to comprehensively assess the molecular changes associated with the KD in epilepsy. Moreover, the KD is often unpalatable, especially to children, and must be sustained for years, resulting in poor compliance. In addition, constipation and weight loss are common adverse effects . In several clinical studies, the KD was also found to influence mood.",41c17742-80f6-49d7-b85f-9c2511389c93
2,introduction2," Although most of these studies reported positive effects (Halyburton et al., 2007; McClernon et al., 2007; Dm et al., 2016), some reported no effects or even negative effects on mood . These inconsistences may be related to the type of disease before KD treatment, the number of subjects, and the duration of KD compliance, necessitating larger-scale, multiple-center studies to assess the influence of the KD on mood in specific diseases. Death during KD treatment has also been reported secondary to severe infection and malnutrition . Therefore, a better understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms may improve clinical application and reveal new targets for clinical anti-epileptic treatment.",136db0c3-9607-483e-80b0-53684ea10fa2
3,introduction3,"  Previous studies on the antiepileptogenic efficacy of the KD focused mainly on changes in the expression of specific preselected proteins or genes, while few have used gene chips to objectively explore larger-scale gene expression changes associated with KD treatment of epilepsy . Modern proteomics techniques can reveal similarities and differences in protein expression at the individual, pathway, and network levels under various physiological and pathological states, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of disease pathology and progression . Such proteomics studies have examined the pathogenesis of epilepsy , but not the mechanisms underlying the antiepileptogenic action of KD. At present, the main technologies used in proteomics research are two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS).",531b665b-16d1-42a6-8c4c-954c185052b4
4,introduction4," The former is technically demanding, is not amenable to automation, and has limited separation capacity, especially for low abundance and hydrophobic proteins. Alternatively, mass spectrometry is suitable for high-throughput analysis by automation and can discriminate proteins of similar size and isoelectric point.  Therefore, we conducted the first proteomics analysis of the antiepileptogenic response to KD in the rat lithium chloride-pilocarpine-induced epileptic model using MS-based tandem mass tag (Tandem mass tag (TMT)) quantitative proteomics.

Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experimental Ethics Committee of Suzhou University. All rats were raised under a 12 h:12 h light: dark cycle with free access to drinking water and the indicated diet (normal or KD). Animals were protected from bright lights and excessive noise during housing. Rats were first randomly divided into a control group (Ctr, n = 10) and seizure model group (n = 35). Rats exhibiting status epilepticus following lithium chloride-pilocarpine treatment (detailed below) were then randomly assigned to the normal diet group (SE) or KD diet group (SE + KD).",373c9e01-5793-4def-9771-1233bd005d65

Acute status epilepticus was stopped after 60 min by intraperitoneal administration of 300 mg/kg chloral hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, United States). Five rats died due to generalized tonic seizures. Animals surviving status epilepticus were randomly divided into the normal diet SE group (n = 12) and SE + KD (n = 11) group. There were no differences in seizure duration and severity between groups. In each group, 10 rats were randomly labeled for weight and blood ketone measurements.

30,discussion0,"In recent years, our team has conducted a series of studies on the neuroprotective and antiepileptogenic efficacies of KD in rats. Tian et al. (2015, 2016) found that chronic KD treatment reversed the adverse neurobehavioral, cognitive, and neurochemical changes in Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to recurrent neonatal seizures. Moreover, these studies utilized a novel “twist” seizure model to assess both spontaneous and induced seizures by coupling early-life flurothyl-induced neonatal seizures with later penicillin exposure, and demonstrated that KD could also increase seizure threshold to penicillin. Lusardi et al. (2015) used two epileptic models to examine the effect of KD on epileptogenesis, and found that 100% of all normal-fed rats demonstrated stage-3 seizures or higher after 15 pentylenetetrazol injections, whereas only 37% of KD-fed rats reached comparable seizure stages.",42fbc58b-c0bc-4359-8c3e-c3645d1b6478
31,discussion1," They also found that normal-fed animals exhibited spontaneous seizures of progressively greater severity and frequency following pilocarpine induction, whereas KD-fed animals showed a prolonged reduction in seizure severity and frequency. Collectively, these studies demonstrated that KD can suppress epileptogenesis in rats. These findings and those of our previous study provide theoretical and technical support for the antiepileptogenic and neuroprotective effects of KD.  In the current study, we identified 79 proteins that were reciprocally regulated by KD (i.e., exhibiting upregulation in the SE group compared to the control group but downregulation in the SE + KD group compared to the SE group or vice versa). These reciprocal changes may be attributed to the antiepileptogenic effect of the KD.",31b5fcbb-973f-4d7c-bb89-0ba4435f0da8

We suggest the following pathogenic processes to explain epileptogenesis and mitigation by the KD. The blood–brain barrier (by the KD The blood–brain barrier (BBB)) was initially damaged by lithium chloride-pilocarpine-induced SE as indicated by abnormal abundance of α-dystrobrevin .",da92c5c4-1524-41ff-a33c-88ecee1c5b81
33,discussion3," In turn, by the KD The blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption induced neuroinflammation as evidenced by tetraspan-2 upregulation, which led to dysfunctional lipid metabolism as evidenced by oxysterol-binding protein upregulation. Dysfunction of lipid metabolism induced mitochondrial dysfunction and deficient autophagy as indicated by the changes in abundance of progesterone receptor membrane component 2 and centromere protein V, respectively. Finally, defective autophagy resulted in accumulation of damaged mitochondria, triggering epilepsy and neuronal death. Alternatively, each of these pathogenic processes was reversed by KD. In addition, KD upregulated the abundance of solute carrier family 17 (sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransporter) member 6 and complexin 3, both of which are neuroprotective (Ono et al., 1998; Van Liefferinge et al., 2015).

34,discussion4," Alpha-DB in astrocyte end-feet is an important regulator of by the KD The blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. It was reported that the aquaporin-4 water channel and Kir4.1 potassium channel were downregulated in the brain of DTNA knockout mice, resulting in enhanced cerebral capillary permeability, gradual cerebral edema, and ultimate damage to neurovascular units . Damage to the by the KD The blood–brain barrier (BBB) can induce astrocyte dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and epilepsy . Our results suggest that KD mitigates epilepsy development in part by restoring by the KD The blood–brain barrier (BBB) function through increased α-DB abundance.  Tetraspan-2 (Tspan2) is a small transmembrane protein widely distributed in the central nervous system. Knockout of Tspan2 activates white matter astrocytes and microglia (de Monasterio-Schrader et al.",4a472cf0-b519-4a08-bf5a-f9645c11dcf9
35,discussion5,", 2013), suggesting that Tspan2 inhibits neuroinflammation, a central pathogenic process in epilepsy . During the development of epilepsy, astrocytes and microglia proliferate, activate, and release inflammatory factors, leading to abnormal neural network connections and aggravating neurotoxicity (Rana and Musto, 2018). In contrast, KD promotes neuroprotection and suppresses epileptogenesis by inhibiting this inflammatory response (Stafstrom and Rho, 2012; Simeone et al., 2018). In the current study, the abundance of Tspan2 was downregulated in the SE group compared to the Ctr group but upregulated after KD. Therefore, we speculate that KD also suppresses epileptogenesis by increasing Tspan2 and suppressing epilepsy-associated neuroinflammation.  There is a strong mutual interaction between cellular inflammation and lipid metabolism, as imbalanced lipid metabolism can result in inflammation (Sun et al.",ae97890a-707b-45b4-a8c3-c4a8ab8892d6
36,discussion6,", 2009), while inflammation can promote cellular lipid uptake and accumulation, and inhibit cholesterol efflux . Oxysterol binding protein (Accession number: Q5BK47), also known as oxysterol binding protein-like 2 (OSBPL2), is a highly conserved transporter protein that controls cholesterol and PI (4,5) P2 levels in the plasma membrane (Wang et al., 2019b). In addition, OSBPL2 is involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and cholesterol ester. Knockout or silencing the OSBPL2 gene inhibited AMPK activity and increased intracellular cholesterol and cholesterol ester synthesis (Wang et al., 2019a; Zhang et al., 2019). Imbalanced cholesterol homeostasis is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple disorders, including cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and central nervous system diseases (Chistiakov et al., 2016; Xue-Shan et al., 2016; Puglisi and Yagci, 2019).",72462fe6-b1b1-48f3-b782-5d693ad65e52
37,discussion7," Altered levels of cholesterol and certain oxysterols have been reported in the hippocampus of rats following kainic acid-induced epilepsy . We found that levels of the lipid metabolism-related molecules ApoE, clusterin, and ACAT-1 were upregulated after flurothyl-induced recurrent seizures in neonatal rats, while KD reversed these changes as well as the cognitive and neurobehavioral abnormalities associated with seizures . Thus, KD may also protect against epilepsy and associated sequelae by normalizing lipid homeostasis. Indeed, the downregulation of OSBPL2 observed in the SE group compared to the Ctr group was reversed by KD, which may in turn reduce cellular cholesterol accumulation, thereby mitigating oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage (Wang et al., 2019a).  Accumulation of cholesterol is a major cause of mitochondrial dysfunction in different models and cells.",eafa865e-c3f3-47c6-8057-b2f58dde15bf
38,discussion8," In Alzheimer’s disease and Niemann-Pick type C disease, mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation disrupts membrane physical properties and restricts the transport of glutathione into mitochondrial matrix, thus impairing mitochondrial function . In a mouse non-alcoholic fatty liver disease model, cholesterol overload contributed to a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content, and to significant alterations in mitochondrial dynamics (Dominguez-Perez et al., 2019). Kim et al. (2006) found that 7-ketocholesterol enhanced 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in PC12 cells. Progesterone receptor membrane component 2 (PGRMC2) is a member of the progesterone membrane-related receptor (membrane related receptor (MAPR)) family. It contains a heme-binding domain similar to cytochrome EB5 and a recent study  found that deletion of PGMRC2 reduced intracellular heme synthesis.",91b6c4fa-ae3d-4d8b-bed9-3a8051af23dc
39,discussion9," Heme promotes neurogenesis as well as neuronal survival and growth. However, dysregulation of intracellular heme concentration can result in neurodegeneration and impaired neurological function (Gozzelino, 2016). Reduction of heme synthesis in primary rat hippocampal neurons using n-methyltropophyrin reduced mitochondrial complex IV, activated carbon monoxide synthetase, and altered amyloid precursor protein (APP)α and APPβ protein levels, suggesting that decreased heme contributes to the neuronal dysfunction of Alzheimer’s disease . In accord with these findings, blockade of heme biosynthesis by siRNA-mediated knockdown and n-methyltropophyrin IX treatment in differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells resulted in mitochondrial membrane depolarization, lower intracellular ATP production, APP aggregation, suppressed soluble (s)APPα secretion, and increased sAPPβ secretion . Reduced intracellular heme was shown to disrupt mitochondrial function.",3c200e1e-f043-483d-84a1-f9d00393cfea
40,discussion10," Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction is a common pathway for neurodegeneration , so we speculate that decreased abundance of PGRMC2 in the SE group compared to the Ctr group is indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction, consistent with our previous study showing that flurothyl-induced seizures significantly depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced mitochondrial fusion protein 2 expression, and upregulated dynamic related protein 1 (drp1) in hippocampus . Conversely, KD upregulated PGRMC2, suggesting that KD also protects against neuronal death and epilepsy by sustaining mitochondrial function .  Intracellular cholesterol accumulation not only damages mitochondria, but also impairs autophagy by interfering with the fusion of autophagosomes with endosomal-lysosomal vesicles (Barbero-Camps et al., 2018).",f5be2b5c-7c75-487a-9447-e4d4ba7f6778
41,discussion11," Autophagy defects reduce the capacity of cells to remove damaged organelles, protein aggregates, macromolecules, and other toxic substances, leading to dysfunction and death. Further, numerous studies have implicated autophagy defects in epilepsy. Knockout of ATG-7, a key molecule in the autophagy cascade, leads to spontaneous seizures in mice, implying that inhibition of autophagy is sufficient to induce epilepsy . We also reported that ratio of LC3 II/I was downregulated in the hippocampus of newborn rats subjected to repeated seizure induction using flurothyl, indicating reduced numbers of autophagosomes, while p62 was upregulated, indicating enhanced autophagic flux . Centromere protein V (Centromere protein V (CENPV)) contributes to the maintenance of cell dynamics by stabilizing microtubules , and this process is critical for autophagy.",9d785c90-1e91-4da9-a656-c81ad8b2c750
42,discussion12," The microtubule organizing center (microtubule organizing center (MTOC)) containing Centromere protein V (CENPV) is critical for centripetal transport of autophagosomes from the cell periphery as well as for the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes . In the present study, the abundance of Centromere protein V (CENPV) was reduced in the SE group, suggesting impaired microtubule stability leading to disrupted autophagy. We suggest that the ability of KD to activate autophagic pathways and reduce brain injury in response to both pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures  and lithium chloride–pilocarpine-induced seizures is mediated by Centromere protein V (CENPV) upregulation.  The synaptic vesicle cycle plays an important role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the presynaptic terminal.",3e5b0f27-0676-4665-81db-461ebd8573d0
43,discussion13," Disruption of synaptic vesicle recycling leading to defects in synaptic transmission may contribute to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and autism (Waites and Garner, 2011), and changes in synaptic vesicle recycling have also been observed in pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus model rats . Further, KD can support synaptic vesicle recycling , so we speculate that KD also prevents epileptogenesis by normalizing this pathway. In fact, synaptic vesicle recycling pathway proteins were enriched in both populations of proteins demonstrating differential abundance between groups (SE vs. Ctr and SE + KD vs. SE), and two proteins involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle, solute carrier family 17 member 6 and complexin 3, were reciprocally regulated (upregulated in the SE group and downregulated after KD). Thus, these proteins may be the targets of KD for preventing epileptogenesis.",212d7e14-2562-44e9-ad52-185c1b3a1aae
44,discussion14,"  Solute carrier family 17 (Sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransporter), member 6, also known as vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2, encoded by Slc17a6) is a low affinity transporter of glutamate from the cytoplasm into synaptic vesicles . Expression is lower in the hippocampus of patients with intractable epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis (Van Liefferinge et al., 2015), consistent with findings of reduced abundance in the SE group. Lobo et al. (2011) found that high glutamic acid exposure reduced VGLUT2 expression by hippocampal neurons, resulting in substantial excitotoxicity. As KD reversed this decline, improved glutamate transport may also contribute to reduced epileptogenesis.  The complexins (Cplxs) are four small SNARE-related proteins (Cplx1–4) that regulate rapid calcium-triggered exocytosis of synaptic, and thus are important for maintaining synaptic neurotransmission (Hazell and Wang, 2005; Yi et al., 2006).",f2d56712-d245-4bcc-a2f6-909e85673144
45,discussion15," Knockout of all Cplxs genes in mice significantly reduced the calcium-triggered release of glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid from hippocampal and striatal neurons . Alternatively, injecting recombinant Cplx2 into Aplysia buccal ganglion neurons inhibited neurotransmitter release, while injecting Cplx2 antibody increased release . Mice harboring a mutant Cplx1 gene exhibited ataxia and sporadic convulsions . In the current study, the abundance of Cplx3 was decreased in the SE group and was restored by KD, suggesting that KD may mitigate epileptogenesis by reducing uncontrolled glutamate release, thereby restoring appropriate excitatory–inhibitory balance.  Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively analyze the changes in protein abundance induced by the KD diet among epileptic model rats through quantitative proteomics.",ed1cbd12-bdc7-41a0-b923-38e241b75a60
46,discussion16," We identified several 100 proteins demonstrating differential abundance among control, epilepsy, and epilepsy plus KD groups, of which 79 were reciprocally regulated by SE and KD. Five of these proteins were further verified by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). Subsets of these proteins are implicated in lipid metabolism, blood–brain barrier integrity, mitochondrial function, neuroinflammation, and autophagy. Other proteins regulated by both seizures and KD are involved in synaptic vesicle recycling. Collectively, these findings provide clues to the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiepileptogenic effects of KD and define multiple potential therapeutic targets. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of action require further verification.",0583ba96-6776-47d4-b39c-ae65b7d08bab
47,discussion17," In future studies, we will focus on selected KD-sensitive target proteins and examine the phenotypic changes conferred by knockout and overexpression, identify proteins interacting with target proteins, observe the effects of target protein expression level changes on epilepsy-related pathophysiological processes, and examine if KD can preserve neural circuit integrity, normal behavior, and cognition in epileptic rats via changes in target protein expression.
