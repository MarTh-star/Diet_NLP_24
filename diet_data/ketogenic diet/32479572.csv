Study Design and Population  The study was designed as a multi-center, prospective, uncontrolled trial in a real-life setting and included Caucasian outpatient women with overweight or obesity and some features of the metabolic syndrome, including increased waist circumference (WC) and pharmacologically controlled arterial hypertension [25]; 11/33 subjects were on pharmacological therapy for arterial hypertension (Table S1). All patients were consecutively admitted to one of the 5 participating clinical centers in the Milan area (Italy) in the period 2016–2018. Each clinical center is specialized in the medical management of obesity, with a specific expertise in very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program, and includes expert physicians; 2 centres also included a trained dietician.",ca340c67-2050-453d-9c1d-9c8295a29351

These parameters were also recorded at all subsequent visits. A total of 44 eligible patients (age 49.5 ± 7.2 yrs, and BMI 30.9 ± 2.7 kg/m2 (mean ± SD)) were enrolled in the study and started a very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) dietary program (Pentadiet program, Figure 1) with a total intervention duration of 24 weeks.

The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the declaration of Helsinki (http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/, accessed 2 April 2021), and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (approval N°441/2011). Patients were informed about all aspects related to the study, possible benefits and risks were explained at the beginning of the study and subjects were informed about the possibility to leave the study at any time without penalty. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject before starting the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program.  2.2. Clinical Procedures  The overall duration of the study was 24 weeks, divided into 4 sequential phases: two “active phases” (phases 1 and 2) and two “stabilization phases” (phases 3 and 4) (Figure 1).",dbe0d36b-7727-4561-a90e-a31fa42aa90a

The average daily food intake, including pre-prepared meals (Protiligne, Table S2B), varied according to each phase. As reported in Table S2, the energy and macronutrient content of meal replacement portions were within the indicated range, and varied according to each specific type (i.e., soups, cakes, meat plates, etc.).

Patients were instructed to drink not less than 1.5–2 L of water daily and to avoid ingestion of any sweets, sugarfree chewing gums and soft drinks, herbal tea with fruit, and preserved vegetables. The program included the use of a vitamin and mineral supplement (PentaCal, Table S2A) during phases 1 and 2.

Study Population  The study included women with upper-range overweight or grade 1–2 obesity and was conducted in a real-life setting. Among the 44 eligible patients, 11 were excluded before the start of the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program, due to personal reasons or duties, such as lack of motivation in undergoing the dietary plan or family problems (Figure 2).",1389faf6-91e8-4ec1-a584-45ae34a0e795
10,methods10," Therefore, 33 subjects were allocated to the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program, and, since 3 participants dropped-out during phase 1 (n = 2) or phase 2 (n = 1) by directly declaring to exit from the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program, due to lack of interest/motivation, 30 subjects completed the study (Figure 2) and their baseline data are reported in Table 1. The study subjects had a BMI of 30.9 ± 2.7 kg/m2, with a relevant abdominal adiposity (WC: 96.0 ± 9.4 cm), mild dyslipidemia (LDL-C: 144.0 ± 33.6 mg/dL; non HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C): 164.9 ± 35.7 mg/dL) and some degree of insulin resistance, as shown by a moderately elevated HOMA-IR (3.17 ± 2.67).  3.2.",7e274bfb-8239-4178-9ce6-fa9855147d90
11,methods11," Analysis of the Ketogenetic Effect of very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD)  The determination of urinary ketones, an indirect index of carbohydrate restriction and adherence to the proposed dietary plan based on a very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) approach, was performed in order to evaluate the actual presence of ketogenesis produced by dietary carbohydrate restriction during the first 2 phases of the protocol. As expected, urinary ketones were not detectable at baseline. The occurrence of dietary-induced ketogenesis, detected by the presence of urinary ketones, was observed in 78% of the patients after phase 1 and in 50% of the patients after phase 2.  3.3. Effect of very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) on Anthropometric Parameters  Over the entire very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program, which lasted 24 weeks, all anthropometric parameters were progressively improved, with a total significant decrease of 14.6% in body weight and BMI (Figure 3A), 12.",455190c1-120a-4e3a-b1d0-4401aa35990e
12,methods12,"4% in WC (Figure 3B) and 10.0% in HC, resulting in a lower (−2.7%) Waist-to-Hip ratio (Waist to Hip ratio (WHR)) (Figure 3C). It should be highlighted that the reduction of BMI and WC in a single-phase, although significant after each of them compared to the start value, was greater during phases 1–2 (BMI: −6.2% and −4.9%, WC: −4.7% and −4.6%, respectively) (Figure 3A,B), although some contribution to total weight loss was observed in all subsequent phases, leading to a cumulative 11.5 kg weight loss, on average. At the end of the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) protocol, 33.3% of the participants reached a normal weight and the obesity prevalence was reduced from 70% to 16.7%. As a consequence, the overweight group rose from 30 to 50% (Figure 4).  3.4. Effect of very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) on Glucometabolic and Cardiovascular Parameters  At baseline, patients enrolled in the study displayed a moderate rate of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR: 3.17 ± 2.67) (Table 1.",c5f6202e-de81-495f-b836-b0c5826f8f24
13,methods13," The very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program showed a specific effect on this parameter, as it was significantly reduced to 1.73 ± 1.23 (−38.0%; p = 0.003) at the end of phase 2, due to reduction of both plasma insulin (−35.0%; p < 0.001) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (−8.7%; p = 0.002), in association with reduced HbA1c (−5.6%; p = 0.008), and then remained unchanged after phase 3 (Table 2). The TyG index was also significantly improved (p < 0.001) (Table 2). No changes in uric acid levels were observed (Table 3). SBP decreased after phase 1 (−3.5 mmHg; −2.5%; p = 0.006) and then remained unchanged until the end of the program. As reported above, the study subjects showed moderate baseline hypercholesterolemia (TC 223.0 ± 37.7) mg/dL). TC, TG and LDL-C were significantly reduced by the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program after phase 3, along with a significant increase of HDL-C (p = 0.027), resulting in reduced non-HDL-C (Table 3).",7c0afb9f-b33f-488c-9c85-7d33b377491d
14,methods14," The individual change of LDL-C level showed some variability since 6/30 patients displayed no changes and 6/30 had moderately increased concentrations (maximum 158 mg/dL in one case). Moreover, hsCRP (always below 0.1 mg/L; not shown) and uric acid (Table 3) concentrations did not significantly change during the intervention. At baseline, the study subjects were almost entirely at very low/low cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, according to FRS lipids, FRS BMI and EAS/ESC SCORE algorithms. Interestingly, however, the BMI and lipid improvements driven by very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) resulted in a mean absolute reduction of these scores: FRS lipids (from 1.99 ± 1.57 to 1.53 ± 1.20), FRS BMI (from 6.23 ± 4.13 to 5.05 ± 3.12) and EAS/ESC SCORE (from 0.42 ± 0.34 to 0.36 ± 0.30), due to the specific reduction in the few with higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.  3.5.",fd5c2871-a3d3-4b58-940a-c23256d2d5ec
15,methods15," Effect of very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) on Markers of Liver, Kidney and Thyroid Function  At baseline, the markers of liver, kidney and thyroid function were within the reference range and remained within it over the entire duration of the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program (Table 3). A significant but moderate decrease was observed for γ-GT, creatinine and creatinine clearance (Table 3).  4. Discussion  This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and the safety of a multiphasic very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program, conducted in a multi-center real-world setting, in women with overweight or obesity. The main objective was to assess the actual health benefits of such approach in the context of the day-by-day management of these clinical conditions. The proposed multiphasic very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program turned out to be safe, according to liver, kidney and thyroid biomarkers.",9fa406af-6d89-4910-b774-6a039f68a2b5
16,methods16," Moreover, in the patients who completed the program, a set of important improvements related to cardiovascular function and cardiometabolic disease risk has been accomplished.  The efficacy data obtained show that the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program resulted in a significant reduction (−14.6%) of body weight and BMI, which is also greater than the 10% threshold proposed by the obesity guidelines [15]. The average absolute reduction of BMI (−4.4 kg/m2) is similar to that obtained in hospital-based studies with a ketogenic phase up to 4 weeks (−4.2 kg/m2) or at least 4 weeks (6.2 kg/m2) [31]. Notably, the mean BMI value at the end of the protocol (26.5 kg/m2) is just above the upper end (25 kg/m2) of the normal range, with a reduction of subjects in the obese range from 70 to 16.7% at visit 3, but some weight regain at visit 4, leading to a final 30% obese subjects.",1b624853-04c0-400f-ba54-0d59152e21a2
17,methods17," On the other side, the percentage of subjects in the normal BMI range stably increased from 0% at baseline to 40% at the end of the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program. These findings may suggest that the health professional input is relevant not only in the initial phase of the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program but also in the last phase and the subsequent follow-up over the months and the years, in order to promote the longest time free of disease. Follow-up visits are important since, according to the obesity guidelines [15], once achieved, the body weight reduction of at least −10% or more should be maintained at least for 5 years to obtain an optimal benefit. Unfortunately, data from follow-up visits, after completion of the 6-month very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program, could not be collected in this study, highlighting the relevant lack of long-term follow-up control visits in the real-world context.",793b75d9-c9f8-4bbc-8f5b-b5cbccc812e8
18,methods18," Possible reasons are lack of motivation, reduced synergy with the physician or the team and additional costs. In any case, this may clearly result in a long-term reduced benefit of the initial weight loss, since only one recommendation of the guidelines (weight reduction by at least −10%, but not 5 years maintenance) is fulfilled.  Interestingly, an additional important advantage of this very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) protocol was the marked decrease of WC, which was reduced by 11.9 cm to an average of 84.1 cm, which is even below the cut-off proposed by the harmonized criteria for metabolic syndrome [25] and in line with previous meta-analysis data [31]. Needless to say, this was a major benefit [8,32], which is reflected by the improvements of a several cardiometabolic biomarkers. In our study, we observed a reduction of SBP, TC, TG, LDL-C and a small but significant increase of HDL-C.",8ca4fee9-d3e9-481f-8547-802a3eb45c4b
19,methods19," The impact of very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) on LDL-C is still controversial in some instances, since it has been reported either unchanged [31] or reduced, such as, on average, in our study and in other recent studies conducted in men [33], or increased in a subset of patients (1 out of 4 patients) undergoing very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) [34], probably due to the impact of some gene variants [22]. These observations suggest that several factors, such as sex (our study included only women), the presence of selected gene variants, etc., may influence the individual LDL-C response to very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) and, indeed, also in our study we found some patients with no LDL-C changes and a few with a moderate increase of this marker.",8ca1199e-120d-4b66-89b3-155d58f28eb5
20,methods20," These findings then highlight the importance to evaluate LDL-C levels before and during/after a very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program, making sure, when appropriate, to implement a specific diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation to assess atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) (AScardiovascular disease (CVD)) risk [35].  The overall reduction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk scores appears to be an important achievement of the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) treatment evaluated in this study. Although the selected study cohort was already at low cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk at baseline, due to the female sex, no smoking, and the low-risk area (Italy) of their origin, the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program resulted in a further reduction (due to LDL-C and SBP reduction) of the SCORE cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and of the FRS BMI and FRS lipids.",f913b60b-1d7c-4a27-a0dc-7ea96cf6f07d
21,methods21," Therefore, the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD)-driven improvement of several variables, either included or not in these risk algorithms, plays a role in reducing the global cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.  A relevant reduction of insulin resistance, according to HOMA-IR reduction from 3.17 to 1.78 on average, represented another benefit, in line with other hospital-based studies [36]. Interestingly, subjects with HOMA-IR values above the threshold of 2, which indicates the presence of insulin resistance, were 66.7% at baseline but only 30% at the end of the protocol, suggesting that some participants did not fully improve their insulin resistance status.  These results obtained in a real-world setting thus appear comparable with those obtained in hospital-based studies and are relevant not only for body weight reduction per se but also of advantage in the overall reduction of primary CV and metabolic risk.",ed24bbb4-235e-47d1-ba7a-5ff39fd5d8b2
22,methods22,"  very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) may be a challenging approach for patients, especially in the first 2 phases, and requires a series of social and psychological features that may not be available to all subjects candidate to such treatment. This is reflected by a rather relevant rate of drop-out or non-compliance associated with very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD). Overall, 11/44 subjects either did not start our protocol and additional 3/33 (9%) dropped out within the first week of treatment, due to family reasons or lack of motivation to implement such a specific dietplan. Such drop-out rate is similar to that (7.5%) previously reported [31], suggesting that, since a very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is obviously conducted as outpatients, the quality of the health personnel in our 5 clinical facilities was not substantially different from that present in research hospitals.",d7d51cf2-73f3-4747-b522-7f92db663edc
23,methods23," It is important to emphasize that the maximum reduction of body weight/BMI and of WC as well as cardiometabolic improvements were achieved after completion of the entire very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD). Thus, it is important to avoid, especially in the real-world setting, the earlier interruption of such program after phases 1, 2 and 3, which sometimes happens due to excessively fast expectations by patients or quicker access to subsequent plastic surgery. Interestingly, some strategies to improve adherence to very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) in the real-world setting have been recently published [37,38]  This study has some limitations. A control group undergoing standard of care treatment (i.e., a low-calorie balanced diet) was not included, which does not allow one to compare this approach to the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) one, when referring, for example, to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction.",5937bacd-a094-4e59-b6e0-46711adfb953
24,methods24," In this regard, a study reporting the comparison between very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) and standard low-calorie diet in the treatment of obesity in a hospital setting [39] showed that, over a 12-month timeframe, the very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) intervention was associated with much greater improvement of anthropometric parameters.  Moreover, no body composition assessment or indirect calorimetry could be conducted and no blinding was possible, nor was the compilation of a food diary was achievable. In addition, only three blood samplings were performed, along with the five visits, without the possibility to collect and store additional serum samples for additional experimental determinations (i.e., adipokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines).",f11caeba-003e-4f94-a398-1a168b0db01d
25,methods25," This precluded the opportunity for a more detailed cardiometabolic study, for example, evaluating the leptin: adiponectin ratio, which is markedly reduced by loss of adipose mass and has been shown to predict carotid intima-media thickness in males [40] or of circulating ghrelin levels [19,41]. Importantly, men and non-Caucasian subjects could not be included in this study since both are not referring in a relevant way to clinical practice for very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) in Italy.  The findings of this study on a multi-center very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) program conducted in a real-world setting in a cohort of women with overweight or obesity indicate that it is safe and effective since it results in a major improvement of cardiometabolic parameters, thus leading to benefits that span well beyond the mere body weight/abdominal adiposity reduction, as they lead to a decreased primary cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic risk.",a77992bc-c57a-4868-96af-7b707c13e7e1
26,methods26," Our data cannot however be directly extended to women with severe obesity (BMI > 37 kg/m2) and relevant organ complication or failure, or to the male sex, which should be the focus of specific studies. Future developments in the practical application of very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD), especially in real-world clinics, may include the evaluation of genomic determinants of responsiveness to very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) and their clinical implementation following rigorous frameworks for gene variant interpretation [34].
