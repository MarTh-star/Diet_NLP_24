0,introduction0,"The KD, tested for the first time in 1921 for intractable childhood epilepsy, is based on a normocaloric, high fat, adequate-protein, and low-carbohydrate diet resulting in the production of KBs (Keene, 2006). Different types of KDs have been described. The classic ketogenic therapy is based on a diet providing 90% of calories from long-chain fatty acids, a restricted protein portion (1 g/kg/day), and minimal carbohydrates. Traditionally, the diet is comprised of four parts fat, mainly LCTs, for one part carbohydrates and proteins. The ratio can be modified to 3:1, 2:1, or 1:1, respectively, similar to the modified Atkins diet . The monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)s diet is also proposed with 60% of calories from octanoate and decanoate that are more ketogenic than LCTs (Huttenlocher, 1976). The last alternative to a ketogenic therapy is the low glycemic index diet characterized by higher amounts of carbohydrates with low glycemic index .",206a46e9-5744-4d48-9a64-855d045aef18
1,introduction1,"  Despite the underlying, unclear mechanisms, KD is considered to be a “neuroketotherapeutic” (Koppel and Swerdlow, 2017). The efficacy of KD in drug-resistant epilepsy in children and adult patients has been proven for almost a century (Stafstrom and Rho, 2012) with more than 50% reduction in seizures for intractable childhood epilepsy (Lefevre and Aronson, 2000). KD has progressively gained interest for the treatment of other diseases as a stand-alone metabolic therapy or as part of a general, therapeutic strategy . Various mechanisms have been advocated to explain the anti-convulsive and neuroprotective effects of KD, such as a decrease in glucose metabolism due to the increase in lipid oxidation, a reduction in ROS production, an increase in ATP, and modulations of neuronal membrane excitability, inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function .",6be2457e-c5d7-45c4-aa63-658d9ab1b7a7
2,introduction2,"  Thus, KD is expected to be highly relevant in diseases characterized by any of these mechanisms. For example, motor dysfunction, involving the nervous system, muscles and tendons, observed in neuromuscular diseases or as a component of various pathological conditions, may benefit from such treatment. As non-pharmacological management is rarely considered and little data has been published on dietary therapies, we have focused our review on the potential benefit of such KD therapies on motor function. Firstly, we will describe the neuroprotective effects of KD, especially in tissues involved in motor function. Secondly, we will present and discuss pre-clinical and clinical trials of KD for diseases presenting a motor dysfunction. Finally, we will present some perspectives of other new therapeutics, based on metabolic factors targeting energy metabolism.",bf288955-dd76-4009-b2fe-9dbc895e8ea1
3,introduction3,"  Protective Effects of KD on the Neuromuscular System The effects of KD administration on the neuromuscular system come through different mechanisms. For one, KD can directly induce metabolic shifts due to the high blood levels of KBs and to the restriction of carbohydrate intake . KD can also modify nutrient-integrating pathways, such as the mTOR pathway, involved in autophagy and mitophagy-related mitochondrial renewal. Finally, KD might have potential, indirect roles, such as effects on neurotransmission, oxidative stress, and inflammatory mechanisms. Figure 1 sums up the cellular mechanisms induced by KD.  FIGURE 1 Schematic illustration of the main cellular mechanisms in the KD on the neuromuscular system. The main energetic substrate of the nervous system is glucose, but alternative substrates exist, for instance pyruvate , lactate (Dienel, 2012), and βOHB (Kunnecke et al., 1993; Achanta and Rae, 2017).",05f3ec5e-4dba-4051-830e-b8eb0ba481df
4,introduction4," Most KBs (β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate AcAc) used by the brain are supplied by the liver, but they can also be synthesized in astrocytes, which are the only cell type in the brain capable of oxidizing fatty acids (FA). KBs enter cells via the monocarboxylate transporter (monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)). Then, acetyl-CoA can enter the TCA cycle to produce ATP. KD leads to a decrease in glycolytic ATP generation and an increase in ATP generation in mitochondria.

5,introduction5,"  Metabolism Switch Ketogenic diet has a high impact in tissues with a high-energy requirement and with challenges from modifications in metabolic substrates, such as the neuromuscular system. The brain represents 2% of one’s body weight but consumes about 20% of the body’s energy stores  in order to fuel the processes of neurotransmitter production/recycling, vesicular trafficking, maintenance of ion gradients for the propagation of action potentials, and memory, to name a few. Similarly, in the resting state, 20% of the energy expenditure is devoted to muscle , and it can largely increase with muscle contractions, for example for transforming organelles, enzymatic activities, intracellular signaling, and transcriptional responses .  Ketogenic diet promotes KBs (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate) production in the liver from acetyl-CoA formed during mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids.",a9e58082-6c6b-4303-be23-116386f6672f
6,introduction6," Some of the acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle, and the excess is used to form acetoacetate, which could be converted to βOHB by βOHB dehydrogenase (by βOHB dehydrogenase (BDH)) enzyme or spontaneously converted to acetone (Newman and Verdin, 2014). KBs are transported to other tissues (brain, muscle, and heart) through the blood and used as fuel, especially in the brain (Kunnecke et al., 1993; Rae et al., 2012; Achanta and Rae, 2017). It has also been reported that astrocytes can produce KBs from fatty acids  and leucine (Bixel and Hamprecht, 1995). Astrocytes present the same preference for fatty acids (rather than glucose) as metabolic fuel and have enzymatic machinery similar to that of cultured hepatocytes (Guzman and Blazquez, 2001).  β-Hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate enter cells via the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) and provide an alternative substrate for brain.",9d4fa2be-074a-4a82-a848-023f9604586e
7,introduction7," Several studies seem to highlight that KBs are a preferred carbon source under certain conditions (LaManna et al., 2009; Lund et al., 2011; Zhang Y. et al., 2013; Chowdhury et al., 2014; Valente-Silva et al., 2015), but these finding remain controversial (McKenna, 2012; Achanta et al., 2017). Some studies evoked that KBs provide more efficient energy source than glucose, even for the brain. They are metabolized faster than glucose and bypass the glycolytic pathway by directly entering the TCA cycle, whereas glucose has to first undergo glycolysis (Veech et al., 2001; LaManna et al., 2009; Elamin et al., 2017). Consequently, KBs lead to a decrease in glycolytic ATP generation and an increase in ATP generation by mitochondrial oxidation (Kim et al., 2010; Steriade et al., 2014; Hyatt et al., 2016). Moreover, Elamin et al.",a44de1fb-83cd-43c3-bf7f-9c5a41e207c9
8,introduction8," (2017) showed that whereas both glucose and KBs produce two molecules of acetyl-CoA, glucose reduces four molecules of NAD+ and KBs reduce either one (for conversion of BOHB in acetoacetate), or none (for conversion of acetoacetate in acetyl-CoA) during acetyl-CoA synthesis. KD is associated with a coordinated upregulation of hippocampal genes encoding metabolic and mitochondrial enzymes . KD also leads to fatty acid-mediated activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) that inhibits glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis, promotes the transcription of ketogenic enzymes, promoting mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation (Cullingford, 2004). Moreover, the cellular energy reserve is increased as a result from a higher phosphocreatine/creatine ratio in the hippocampal tissue .",f68d4fe0-bd4d-4b3a-8761-36db2929d7c3
9,introduction9,"  Taken altogether, neurons possess a better resistance and adaptive ability to metabolic stress and challenges, both having to do with a more energy-efficient fuel source and a larger mitochondrial load based on a stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis (Bough et al., 2006; Srivastava et al., 2012, 2013).  Antioxidant Effects The accumulation of certain metabolites and hypoxia produced during muscular contractions, along with the high energetic requirement of the brain, might increase ROS production through the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Morales-Alamo and Calbet, 2014). Despite possible, positive effects of ROS production on mitochondrial adaptations , the deleterious effect of oxidative stress must be controlled, primarily in the brain (Islam, 2017). Veech (2014) reported a decrease in free radical production through the reduction of coenzyme Q, induced by KBs.",2f0c3207-8f1c-4f76-8c16-2cfedecf529d
10,introduction10," Importantly, a decrease in oxidative stress and an increase in mitochondrial glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activity were observed during KD, which may protect tissues from injury (Ziegler et al., 2003; Bough et al., 2006; Stafford et al., 2010; Stafstrom and Rho, 2012; Greco et al., 2016). As ROS generation partially reflects mitochondrial function, the decrease in ROS production may be a result of an effect on NADH oxidation or on calcium overload . Some authors have described that, in KD, there is an elevated production of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins, thereby decreasing ROS levels probably via fatty acids found elevated in treated patients (Fraser et al., 2003; Sullivan et al., 2004; Maalouf et al., 2007). Carbohydrate restriction also induces stress response proteins, leading to a lowering of ROS and the maintenance of mitochondrial function . Tieu et al.",bf1e0d48-8b3c-458a-b287-ec0e44c9b6e0
11,introduction11," (2003) observed a beneficial effect of KD in restoring mitochondrial Complex I function following inhibition by pharmacological agents. These results point out a central role of KD in oxidative stress management associated with the mitochondria.  Synaptic Transmission Numerous reports have suggested that the anticonvulsive mechanisms behind ketosis are based on a metabolic shift between the neurotransmitters Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, resulting in an increased inhibition and/or decreased excitation (Bough and Rho, 2007; Yudkoff et al., 2007). This could spark attention toward neuromuscular transmission . Indeed, KD can induce an increase in glutamate decarboxylase expression in the striatum of rats  and an alteration of astrocytic Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) degradation via a modification of Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase activity .",5385644a-68dd-4c9c-950a-f4c2e95b7963
12,introduction12," Moreover, Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) content is increased by KBs in rat brain synaptosomes , rat hippocampus , and in the brain of patients . Some authors have reported the inhibition of glutamatergic, synaptic transmission (Danial et al., 2013; Lutas and Yellen, 2013), which implies a blockade of vesicular glutamate transporters . This interference with glutamate-mediated toxicity, implied in neuronal injury, could explain the interest for KD in neurological diseases.  Signaling Pathways Ketogenic diet could modulate crucial mechanisms in cellular homeostasis. For example, mTOR and activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways involved in cell proliferation, energetic metabolism, or protein biosynthesis could be implicated.",51a957b8-0a19-49cb-bb09-fe949da90eab
13,introduction13," KD induces the binding of insulin and free IGF-1 to their specific tyrosine kinase receptors and activates the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). However, this effect is counteracted by the decrease in the intracellular ATP/AMP ratio and the activation of liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) signaling, inhibiting mTORC1 (Newman and Verdin, 2014). Such effects may be essential for motor dysfunction in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), for example, as deregulation in mTOR and activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways has been described in this disease (Saxena et al., 2013; Perera and Turner, 2016).  Anti-inflammatory Effects Fasting and KD have been associated with effects on inflammatory mechanisms .",1e766012-ca21-4120-90aa-4a16aa849762
14,introduction14," Some authors have observed an elevated expression of cytokine interferon-γ in the hippocampus of rats, thus protecting cells from excitotoxicity . Moreover, fatty acids activate PPARα which, in turn, inhibits the pro-inflammatory NF-κB and cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNFα (Cullingford, 2004; Nandivada et al., 2016). βOHB inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome, which controls the activation of caspase-1 and the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18 .  Use of KD in Motor Dysfunction The beneficial effect of KD has been hypothesized in various diseases, such as epilepsy, metabolic defects, cancers, autism, depression, migraines, narcolepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease (Vanitallie et al., 2005; Baranano and Hartman, 2008; Newport et al., 2015).",c62f4eb8-987b-451d-a870-2d24441caf46

19,introduction19,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) Rational of the Use of KD in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal, neurodegenerative condition characterized by motor neuron degeneration that leads to progressive motor weakness and death between 2 and 5 years from onset . Many molecular mechanisms have been involved in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathophysiology, but the starting point of the disease remains unclear. Drug development has yielded few successes, and the prognosis has not changed dramatically since the first reports, nearly 150 years ago.  Regarding studies on Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse models, Siva (2006) proposed KD as a promising strategy to slow down the progression of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), especially through the increase in mitochondrial function.",ace27a4d-2cf2-4285-8ffa-43618bf1555e
20,introduction20," The main mechanisms related to mitochondrial malfunction and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been recently reviewed .  The heterogeneous effects of KD on the neuromuscular system could support the interest in KD treatment in a heterogeneous disease, such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In fact, many hypotheses have been raised on Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathophysiology. Among the known gene mutations associated with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), TAR DNA-binding protein (TAR DNA binding protein (TARDPB)) gene is related with neuronal density of mitochondria and cristae formation , SOD1 is associated with oxidative stress, and CHCHD10 is involved in oxidative phosphorylation and the maintenance of mitochondrial cristae morphology .",5674e96b-056c-4db0-be6b-bce6b1c218fc
21,introduction21," Other authors have described a decreased activity in mitochondrial Complex I in skeletal muscle and the spinal cord of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients . Moreover, several reports have highlighted metabolic alterations in this disease, enabling a possible role of therapeutics targeting energetic metabolism . Various studies have directly observed shifts in TCA cycle intermediates, such as decreased C4-intermediate levels in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mice , or decreased oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in cellular models, transgenic mice and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients (Jung et al., 2002; Mattiazzi et al., 2002; Menzies et al., 2002; Wiedemann et al., 2002; Browne et al., 2006).",f6f9916b-e9e9-4309-826d-995ae41e23b1
22,introduction22," Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) imbalance and glutamate neurotransmission are also involved in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathophysiology and may be relevant to modulate . Likewise, the roles of neuro-inflammation and oxidative stress have often been indicated in in vitro and in vivo experiments, justifying a therapeutic approach also focused on these mechanisms (Liu and Wang, 2017; Liu et al., 2017). All these mechanisms involved in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathophysiology could justify the use of KD as therapy in this disease.  Evaluation of KD in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Zhao et al. (2006) reported in a study that a higher motor neuron survival and an improved motor function resulted from KD administration through the gain in mitochondrial energy production in SOD1-G93A transgenic Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mice.",ae595e8f-b623-4db1-b33f-a781ebda6cbc

They also demonstrated that βOHB prevented rotenone-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial Complex I . Zhao et al. (2012) confirmed the promising therapeutic approach by way of improvement in mitochondrial function and motor neuron count in an Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse model following administration of caprylic acid, a monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) precursor of KB.  The link between lipid concentrations and survival remains an enigma in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Nevertheless, a recent study has revealed that higher caloric intake improves survival and that low cholesterol may end up being deleterious in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients .",4b8dd1a3-ba51-4510-91e5-d4118b4d535b
24,introduction24," A phase III clinical trial evaluating the safety and the tolerance of KD in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients fed through a gastrostomy tube has been conducted in the United States (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01016522), but results have not yet been published.

Angelman Syndrome (AS) Rational of the Use of KD in AS Angelman syndrome is a devastating, neurological disorder with no treatment. AS patients suffer from motor dysfunction, intellectual disability, frequent smiling and laughter, lack of speech, and severe seizures.

The severity of the hindlimb clasping score was significantly decreased in KE-treated AS mice compared to untreated AS mice.  Both the KD and the low glycemic index diets have been administered to patients and have illustrated promising results in seizures of AS , suggesting that the benefit rather stems from carbohydrate restriction and not from increasing blood KB levels .",c305ba43-5a6b-4a5a-a2f4-f23b481c7ac4
27,introduction27,"  Mitochondrial Myopathy Mitochondrial disorders are clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases with a neuromuscular component caused by mutations either in mitochondrial DNA or in nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Interestingly, KD has showed a relevant effect on a mouse model for late-onset mitochondrial myopathy characterized by generalized muscle weakness (Ahola-Erkkila et al., 2010). KD decreased the amount of Cytochrome c Oxidase-negative muscle fibers and protected mitochondrial ultrastructure in the muscle. A recent study suggested that the use of KD in mitochondrial myopathy enhanced muscle strength and delayed the progression of the disease but might induce muscle damage in a subpopulation .

What Importance Should be Given to KD to Improve Motor Dysfunction? With respect to the neuroprotective effect of KD involving the different mechanisms previously cited and largely involved in pathophysiological mechanisms of various neurological and neuromuscular diseases, the theoretical benefit of KD is not doubtful. As KD and fasting share similar, potentially beneficial effects, we suspect that fasting could be considered as a therapy.

Contrary to other indications such as epilepsy or cognitive dysfunction, little clinical data is available to assess beneficial effects of KD on motor function. Importantly, KD also has short and long-term, adverse effects regardless of the disease. The classic KD has showed more problems of tolerability than the various modified diets. Major short-term side effects are gastro-intestinal disturbances (which could lead to poor compliance), acidosis, and hypoglycemia .

The balance between efficacy and toxicity of KD provides substantial promise for such treatment for motor impairment, but it is probably insufficient when administered alone. However, the lack of double-blind, randomized control studies accurately measuring the effects on motor function prevents one from obtaining clear conclusions about this treatment.",1263db8d-d963-476e-b2bb-8b6bc0eff792

35,introduction35," The DP is essentially comprised of arginine alpha-ketoglutarate (arginine alpha ketoglutarate (AAKG)) and other molecules, such as ubiquinol, monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)s, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. The beneficial role of ubiquinol is based on its role in the electron transport chain in mitochondria and ATP production.  Ari et al. (2014) reported that DP would increase motor function and survival in the SOD1-G93A Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse model. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mice were fed a SD, KD, or either diets containing ingredients of the DP. SD+DP-fed mice showed a better neurological score than the controls, and KD-fed mice exhibited better motor performance in all motor function tests compared to the controls. The Rotarod test revealed better motor performance in KD mice and the grip test also highlighted better performance in KD and SD+DP mice compared to controls.",d7d096b2-613b-4211-bfad-e32691337084
36,introduction36," The Paw Grip Endurance test showed higher motor performance in KD or SD+DP mice than in controls. Significantly, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mice fed SD+DP or KD+DP had a remarkable, extended survival time. Authors have suggested that arginine alpha ketoglutarate (AAKG) enhances blood flow, increases muscle protein synthesis, and ameliorates muscle strength though the metabolic role of α-ketoglutarate. monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)s could have a similar function though their conversion to KBs and acetyl-CoA. The production of energetic intermediates bypassing transport and metabolism of glucose, probably deregulated in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), may increase motor function in this disease.  Ketone Esters (KEs) One therapeutic goal is to replace the KD, and its strict requirements for observance, with dietary supplements that could generate sustained ketosis. KEs are considered to be substitutes for KD and are suitable for oral treatment, compared to KBs.",c7ab32d9-b00a-492f-8023-ae2e140beb34
37,introduction37," Ingestion of KEs can directly increase blood levels of KBs without the delay observed in KD or fasting (Hashim and VanItallie, 2014). The main KEs used are 1,3-butanediol monoester of βOHB and glyceryl-tri-3-hydroxybutyrate (3GHB) (Brunengraber, 1997). Oral and intravenous administering of KEs demonstrated that they were safe and well-tolerated in animals and humans (Clarke et al., 2012a,b), which makes them an interesting complementary treatment.  Ketone ester supplementation has been shown to relieve symptoms in AS mouse models . Positive effects of KEs have been observed in Alzheimer’s mouse models with an improvement in energy metabolism and a reduction in amyloid-β deposition (Zhang J. et al., 2013; Pawlosky et al., 2017). A study in one patient with Alzheimer’s disease treated with KEs exhibited a gain in cognitive function and physical activity .",65ac3a4e-108c-4325-a33e-e9765600ed05
38,introduction38,"  Conclusion The perspective of the use of KD in a variety of diseases has been growing these past recent years. This adjuvant therapy has shown interesting potential in neurological and neuromuscular diseases. The obtained experimental results point out the neuroprotective role of the increase of KBs levels and the reduction of blood glucose, in association with the involvement of various signaling pathways (e.g., IGF-1/AKT/mTOR, activated protein kinase (AMPK)) and effects on inflammation and oxidative status. The utility of KD and its variations for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases suggest a central mechanism in restoring energy metabolism, especially in disease with an impairment of glucose metabolism.",0fa53098-fc9f-48cc-90de-0f8415d6a377
39,introduction39," Although various studies have suggested a positive effect of KD in a number of neuromuscular diseases, several obstacles remain to be tackled before these findings can be applied widely in the clinic, and further research is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms that mediate the neuroprotective effects. Indeed, several points remain unexplored, as for example the direct effects of KBs on gene expression. Many questions remain unanswered: is there a neuroprotective effect of KD in all conditions, pathological or physiological? If the KD can be beneficial for the brain, can it be deleterious for other organs? How long an exposure to the diet is necessary to confer long-term benefit? Does a diet monitoring improved efficacy? It should also be noted that many studies on KD were performed on animal models, highlighted that clinical trials of its use in affected patients are essential.",45834dbb-d37e-44a8-8800-4a7c42fa6d3e
40,introduction40,"  The effects of KD involve numerous mechanisms highlighting specific pathways that can represent interesting therapeutic approaches. Despite the well-documented advantage of KD in the treatment of several diseases, the adverse effects should also be acknowledged. More and more studies search for alternative treatments or diets to KD, presenting similar effects with fewer adverse side effects and fewer daily constraints for patients. However, these diets might represent an exceptional option as a co-adjuvant therapy.  Author Contributions CV-D and HB wrote the manuscript and designed the review.
