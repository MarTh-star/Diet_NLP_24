Study Selection and Data Extraction  According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, two authors screened titles and abstracts independently to identify potential articles. Another two authors selected and decided the final studies included in the analysis by screening the full texts of the potential articles.  Two researchers evaluated study details from all included studies and extracted data using standardized forms.

Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias  The quality and risk of bias critical appraisals of included studies were assessed independently with conflicts resolved through discussion by three researchers on the basis of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs (31). The Cochrane Collaboration's tool provides seven quality domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias.

In addition, we conducted subgroup analyses according to different intervention durations (ranging from 6 weeks to 12 months) and interventions (gluten free and casein free diet (GFCF), gluten free diet (GFD), and KD).  Review Manager 5.4 software (26) was used for the meta-analysis. Because all outcomes of included studies were continuous variables and the scales for each article were different measurements, the effect size was assessed as the standardized mean difference (significant effect (standard mean difference (SMD); 95% CI), while P < 0.05 suggested a significant difference.

Since only one study used the scale (the ROME questionnaire, a valuable tool for assessment of GI symptoms) for GI system evaluation, no meta-analysis was conducted. Ghalichi et al.

22,discussion0," Our results showed that, compared with regular diet, diet interventions can significantly promote clinician-reported core symptoms of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (P = 0.0008). The results of subgroup analysis indicated that: Firstly, we observed the benefits of KD dietary interventions in core symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (PKD = 0.0003), and no significant improvement of gluten free diet (GFD) and gluten free and casein free diet (GFCF) treatment (Pgluten free diet (GFD) = 0.09 and Pgluten free and casein free diet (GFCF) = 0.06); Secondly, it suggested that the effectiveness compared between the different duration of interventions showed no significant difference (significant effect (standard mean difference (SMD) <6M of −0.47, significant effect (standard mean difference (SMD)≥6M of −0.53, P<6M = 0.002, P≥6M = 0.03); Thirdly, it indicated that gluten free diet (GFD) intervention improved the symptoms of social behaviors (P = 0.",0e66f416-b5ae-4315-ae3c-69978c9390b4
23,discussion1,"02), however, the cognition, communication, and stereotypical behaviors symptoms showed no improvement (all P > 0.05); Finally, all studies reported that there were no extra safety concerns compared with the regular diet, and even had improvement in GI discomfort. These data thus lend support to dietary interventions as alternative therapies that can improve the management of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has steadily increased over the past decades (35). The etiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) remains unknown. Various risk factors have been implicated in the causation of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), including genetic, epigenetic, environmental risk factors (prenatally and postnatally changes) (36, 37). The effectiveness of currently available therapies for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is limited and uncertain, so many families search for alternative methods (38).",3ab11581-232e-4187-a15d-38590fd34238
24,discussion2," In this situation, dietary interventions are chosen by many families, because parents believe these therapies can improve behavioral outcomes and may reduce the burden of other co-occurring conditions, such as GI issues (39). Although there is no definitive evidence on the effectiveness of dietary treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), it has been reported that up to 33% of parents hide information on nutritional treatments/supplements from their physician (40). Furthermore, up to 50% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have a dietary intervention that was prescribed by a medical professional (41). At present, the most commonly used dietary interventions are gluten-free and casein-free, ketogenic, and specific carbohydrate diets, as well as probiotics, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and dietary supplements (14).",04485a36-4d67-4594-9b5c-0498f015d217
25,discussion3,"  The main result of the meta-analysis showed a positive effect of diet therapy for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) symptoms [consistent with part of previous reviews (25, 42)], no correlation with the length of the interventions. Besides, the groups on gluten free diet (GFD) diets show improvement in social behaviors compared to control groups. However, another part of systematic reviews suggests that there is little evidence showing the benefits of a gluten free and casein free diet (GFCF) diet for the symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children and point out the importance of identifying the best responders to the gluten free and casein free diet (GFCF) diet (16, 43, 44).  Via subgroup analysis, we observed that there was no statistical significance in the effectiveness of gluten free diet (GFD) and gluten free and casein free diet (GFCF), which was inconsistent with the RCTs by Ghalichi et al. (18) and agreed with the result of Piwowarczyk et al. (19).",c69e30ef-22ea-4009-97d3-7070e361c28c
26,discussion4," This may be due to imperfect blinding and differences in measurement criteria. The benefit of the KD diet supports previous studies (20, 45, 46). Despite this, the limitation is very obvious, such as small sample sizes, subjective nature of parent observations reporting symptoms, difficulty adhering to the diet therapy, lack of uniform measurement standards, variation in dietary composition and dosage between different experiments. Most of the included studies reported no significant side effects, but we should also be vigilant for possible situations, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, weight loss, malnutrition, eating disorders during the dietary intervention (47).  In terms of the quality of the literature and study design, no attrition or reporting bias was found among the seven RCTs, and only in two studies was the randomized method described well.",d9fe479c-7342-4db1-8366-8f9a532a7992
27,discussion5," Only one study used double-blinding and another one was performed single-blinding, all of the remaining five studies did not describe blind methods, which can lead to some degree of bias. Most results of sensitivity analysis showed stability effect, except for the gluten free and casein free diet (GFCF) diets subgroups were influenced by one study separately.  Strength and Limitations  The strength of the meta-analysis is that it is the first study to analyze the effectiveness of diet therapies including gluten free and casein free diet (GFCF) diet, gluten free diet (GFD), and KD for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), quantitatively and systematically. However, the limitations are obvious too. First, the diagnostic criteria for inclusion of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and scales for symptom assessment varied between trials.",720fccfa-e271-4b45-a886-2d43128f8187
28,discussion6," Second, the dietary regulatory process of most experiments and assessment of partial functional levels were done by parents, which meant a certain subjectivity. Third, there were no uniform diet standards, hence the amount and composition of the diets used were different among the intervention groups, and the adherence to the dietary intervention was poor leading to high dropout rates. Fourth, the sample sizes of the included RCTs were relatively small. Finally, due to no contact with the authors of the included studies for further information, the results are based only on data published, and no gray literature is included.  Conclusions  In summary, our study shows that diet therapies are beneficial for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These interventions can significantly ameliorate core symptoms, and the gluten free diet (GFD) diets is conducive to improving social behaviors.",e4b162c6-247d-4d32-bc2b-37dd4d5f5b9c
29,discussion7," The result partly provides evidence for dietary treatment becoming a therapeutic approach for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, the limitations of the literature calls for a more cautious interpretation of the results.
