1,methods0," CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) cohort  In collaboration with the International Foundation for CDKL5 Research, dedicated Centers of Excellence (COEs) were established for expert care of children with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) and parallel clinical research [1]. Our cohorts consisted of individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) seen in COEs at Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH, n = 56), Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF, n = 30), University of Colorado/Children’s Hospital Colorado (CHCO, n = 51), and Baylor College of Medicine (BCM, n = 17). BCM provided data exclusively on movement disorders in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) patients.",051bcbf9-b8cb-473d-bd4c-efbf2a8b21fe
2,methods1," In partnership with the NIH-funded Natural History Study of Rett and Related Disorders (NHS, U54 HD061222; NCT02738281), data related to anti-seizure treatments, as well as medications for sleep dysfunction and behavioral dysregulation, were gathered from an additional cohort of 40 individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) that represents individuals enrolled across 10 clinical sites, and excluded individuals already captured in BCH, CCF, and CHCO COE cohorts. Inclusion criteria included meeting consensus criteria for CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD): a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in CDKL5 gene, motor and cognitive developmental delays, and epilepsy with onset in the first year of life [2]. Each center has an Institutional Review Board (Institutional Review Board (IRB))-approved protocol for prospective and retrospective collection of clinical data, including data from medical records, on individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD).",8e45ff80-a123-429d-9675-a3ab00331cf1
3,methods2," Clinical and genetic data are gathered using standardized clinical research forms across the Centers of Excellence, and maintained in separate REDCap databases. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval exists for all sites in the NHS.  Evaluation of neurologic management  Data were collected both retrospectively and prospectively through the dedicated COEs as part of a clinic-based research study. Physicians in the Centers of Excellence included neurologists and other pediatric specialists, for example gastroenterologists. Medical records and standardized clinical research forms were reviewed to evaluate medication and non-medication treatment approaches for epilepsy, sleep dysfunction, behavioral dysregulation, and movement disorders. For epilepsy, we tabulated anti seizure medication (ASM)s used including response and tolerance, as well as use of ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulator, and epilepsy surgery.",402555d4-85b5-4d6b-b9db-3350f4808dbd

NHS data were obtained as part of initial and yearly research visits. Data on sleep and behavioral medications were collected at BCH, CCF, and through NHS. Data on movement medications were collected at BCH, CCF, and BCM. Data on gastrostomy tubes were collected from BCH and CHCO COEs. Data on response to treatment were not part of clinical research forms or NHS data collection and were only collected at BCH and CCF based on review of medical records.

22,discussion0," In this assessment of current treatment approaches for neurologic aspects of CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) at academic medical centers throughout the USA, we demonstrate that epilepsy is highly refractory, that the most common anti seizure medication (ASM)s prescribed are broad spectrum as appropriate for generalized or mixed-type epilepsy with both focal and generalized seizure types, and that response rate to KD is likely better than to medication but still variable. Data on vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) and other surgical approaches for epilepsy are limited to our report of exposures, as are data on treatment of other neurologic symptoms, including sleep, behavioral, and movement disorders.

23,discussion1,"  The individuals described with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) were treated for multiple generalized and focal seizure types including tonic, tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and spasms, as well as seizures with multiple phases. A separate study evaluating response of epileptic spasms to first-line treatments in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is underway [27]. Response rates to anti seizure medication (ASM)s in our cohort were quite low, ranging from 5 to 36% at 3 months for the most prescribed medications. It is important to note that patients received multiple anti seizure medication (ASM)s simultaneously, as well as other treatments including cannabis derivatives, trial drugs, KD, and epilepsy surgery, which makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the efficacy of any individual treatment. Clinician and caregiver impression of the most helpful epilepsy treatments included clobazam, topiramate, steroids, valproic acid, and lamotrigine.",48b29f36-837d-45e2-bc54-64dec6a33e37
24,discussion2," Though we cannot make firm conclusions about efficacy, this is consistent with one additional report in the literature, also based on retrospective review of caretaker and clinician impression, stating that medications with the highest rates of seizure reduction at 3 months include vigabatrin, clobazam, valproic acid, steroids, lamotrigine, felbamate, and zonisamide [11]. The range of response rates to each anti seizure medication (ASM) in this report was broad, with a maximum of 33% [11]. Despite a low response rate at 3 months, these medications continue to be the most frequently prescribed. While one publication suggested that carbamazepine may exacerbate seizures in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), a more recent retrospective study based on a cohort of 21 individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) reported that sodium channel blockers (SCBs) led to a greater than 50% seizure reduction for more than 6 months in 31.",1c8f2899-8e6e-41ce-be2c-c65e203b9fef

SCBs were used in our cohort, but we did not control for evaluation of individual treatments as was done in Aledo-Serrano’s study, so we cannot draw conclusions on the efficacy of particular anti seizure medication (ASM)s by pharmacologic category. Another recent study based on a group of 14 individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) found that 5 participants responded to a combination of vigabatrin and zonisamide for epileptic spasms [29]. However, our methodology did not allow us to evaluate specific combinations of anti seizure medication (ASM)s and their effects on seizure control.",88a20829-342f-4496-9d8c-d00ce75554fd
26,discussion4," Forty-four percent of the individuals in our study reported worsening seizures associated with anti seizure medication (ASM) treatment, similar to 31% with seizure aggravation in a prior study, but this exacerbation may be due to the evolution of the disease rather than to medications [11]. None of the patients in our cohort had worsening with carbamazepine, and we did not observe a higher rate of seizure exacerbation with use of SCBs compared to other anti seizure medication (ASM)s, in contrast to the one previous study showing seizure exacerbation with carbamazepine [11].  Our response rate to cannabis derivatives, 21–50% at 3 months, is in line with what is reported in the only study in the literature that reports the effect of Epidiolex on seizures in individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) [30], where 41% were reported as responders at 3 months.",94b877ed-2c0a-479d-863b-21e1cc71a9e6
27,discussion5," Results of this prospective open-label interventional study showed that individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) had a reduction in motor seizures from median 66.4 per 28 days to 35.8 at 12 weeks, with stable frequency at 48 weeks [30]. The validity of our results is limited due to missing data for those who used non-FDA approved products.  Ketogenic diet is a common treatment for refractory epilepsy [31]. Compared to the prior report on use of KD in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) reporting a median age of initiation of 4.8 years, individuals in our cohort had a median age of initiation of 1.92 years [12]. Rate of improvement of seizures and cognition was similar compared to this prior study, but our study suggests a trend toward a higher percentage of individuals with response in those who initiated the diet before 1 year of age (80%) compared to those initiating diet after 1 year of age (42%) [12].",2571f8cf-e3e0-4241-a8dc-1a5a2d76d9a9
28,discussion6," The difference did not reach statistical significance and would require further research to determine if efficacy may be higher with initiation in infancy.  Surgical approaches for refractory epilepsy in this series included vagus nerve stimulator (VNS), functional hemispherectomy, and corpus callosotomy. In our cohort, 43% of individuals reported a decrease in seizure frequency and 18% reported a decrease in seizure intensity post-vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) implantation, compared to 68% and 60%, respectively, in a prior study [13]. Additionally, only 12% of our cohort reported a decrease in seizure duration, versus 72% of individuals from ICDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) [13]. The lower rate of reported response in our study may be due to the comparatively small number of individuals who reported vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) use (n = 16), which may limit the representativeness of our sample.",8c9f5961-dd2e-43a9-957c-d627ce642d98
29,discussion7," Additionally, the COEs represent quaternary care centers and may be biased towards a more severely affected group of individuals. Further study is required to assess corpus callosotomy and other surgical approaches to epilepsy treatment in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD).  In addition to treatment for seizure control, nearly one-third of individuals received treatment for sleep disturbances, and 13% received treatment for behavioral dysregulation and movement disorders. Although the prevalence and characteristics of sleep, behavioral, and movement disorders in CDKL5 have been described in the literature [2, 7, 16, 17], data on treatment are limited.

Behavioral disturbances were rated as most burdensome by 17% of caregivers, and sleep problems by 6%, while movement disorders were not selected by any respondents [32]. Additionally, a recent study reported that functional impairment, including lack of ability to sit, use hands, and communicate, was reported to have the greatest adverse impact on quality of life for individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) [25].",4582a9b4-5ee0-4ec2-99ec-0000495e1ecf

Review of emerging therapies  Over the last several years, CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) clinicians, researchers and pharmaceutical company partners have collaborated to bring a number of investigational drugs to clinical trials as well as explore emerging precision therapies for CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD). As of December 2020, there have been five clinical trials for the CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) population with seizure management as the primary outcome measure.",4704f407-ccc3-4004-8063-6c603933d25e
32,discussion10,"  The neurosteroid ganaxolone (an analog of allopregnanolone), which is an allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, recently completed a phase III clinical trial (NCT03572933) that included a 17-week double blind phase [33, 34]. Results included a significant reduction in major motor seizure frequency in comparison with placebo (32.2% vs. 4.0%) [35], and an expanded access program is being developed for ganaxolone in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) [36].  A phase II open-label study with soticlestat (OV935/TAK-935) was recently completed for individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) (NCT03694275) [37]. Soticlestat is a selective cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H) inhibitor that converts brain cholesterol to 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24HC), which is a positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor [37, 38].",d57c602a-3ed8-4a94-b877-f13bbc894940
33,discussion11," The results from the phase II study show that treated individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) (n = 11) experienced a 24% median reduction in major motor seizures during the 12-week maintenance period [37]. Five individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) who continued into the open label extension portion of the study achieved a 50% median motor seizure frequency reduction [37]. The Clinical Global Impression of Change as a secondary end point also demonstrated improvements [37].  Two investigator-initiated studies for therapeutics in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) were an open-label fenfluramine trial (NCT03861871), and a phase II randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of ataluren for the treatment of individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) with nonsense variants in CDKL5 (NCT02758626). Ataluren, a non-aminoglycoside drug, targets pathogenic nonsense variants in other genetic diseases [39].",5cb53155-2c8a-41b1-98ab-22404d555e78
34,discussion12," Results of recent in vitro studies of aminoglycoside drugs demonstrate that nonsense CDKL5 variants are efficiently suppressed, raising the question of utility of ataluren for CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) [39]. Fenfluramine acts on multiple receptors and is involved in the modulation of glutamate as well as increasing serotonin release and inhibiting reuptake [40]. Fenfluramine showed 90% reduction of generalized tonic clonic seizures in this small open label study, while ataluren did not show efficacy [41, 42].  To date, no disease-modifying therapy exists for CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) but several are in development. A protein transduction domain (TAT)-CDKL5 fusion protein was efficiently internalized by target cells and retained CDKL5 activity, suggesting that CDKL5 protein therapy may be an effective clinical tool for the treatment of CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) [43].",d91dd080-a774-4b62-94eb-1c6e8e43fbeb
35,discussion13," A splicing correction strategy has been applied to CDKL5, developing engineered U1snRNA variants that were able to rescue CDKL5 mRNA splicing, protein synthesis, and function [44]. Other researchers induced escape of CDKL5 from X chromosome inactivation by editing DNA methylation on the promoter of CDKL5 using a dCas9-TET1 fusion protein [45]. Recently, the first proof-of-concept study on gene replacement as a potential approach for the treatment of CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) was published, using adeno-associated virus (adeno associated virus (AAV))-CDKL5 vectors in in vivo and in vitro models of CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) [46]. The authors cloned and produced adeno associated virus (AAV) vectors expressing the major CDKL5 brain isoforms and delivered them in a Cdkl5 KO mouse model as well as in a CDKL5-mutant iPSC-derived neuron model [46]. Treatment in the mouse model led to improvements in motor functions and autistic-like behaviors compared to controls.",437cada0-cabb-4860-a3e8-eaf37557dd73
36,discussion14," In the neuron model, treatment led to an increased density of synaptic puncta and ameliorated the calcium signaling defect compared to controls [46]. Future proof-of-concept studies are required to answer fundamental questions [47], but this study represents an important beginning for demonstrating the utility of virus-mediated gene transfer in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) [46].  Limitations  This study is limited by the mixed prospective and retrospective study design. Individuals were seen a variable number of times at the centers and did not necessarily receive their primary management at these centers. Treatment response was exclusively obtained retrospectively from medical records, making any conclusion about efficacy quite limited, so we mainly demonstrate treatment patterns. We are also not able to comment on order of use or specific combinations of medications from this dataset.",245b4ab0-c524-4fcd-bdd2-1432ee4af8ce
37,discussion15," Historical data for individuals enrolled in NHS were gathered primarily from a baseline visit, with additional data coming from 61% of individuals (n = 25) seen for one follow-up, and 37% (n = 15) seen for two follow-ups. Lastly, the majority of our cohort was white and non-Hispanic, likely due to disparities in testing or referrals. Future research would benefit from including a broader and more diverse sample.  Conclusion  Our study provides an overview of current treatment patterns for neurologic symptoms in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), including aspects of the disorder for which there is limited information in the literature such as treatment for sleep, behavior and movement disorders, as well as non-pharmacological treatments for epilepsy including ketogenic diet and surgery.",25b50ecf-7044-4eaf-9c0c-048eec90acad
38,discussion16," By emphasizing the refractory nature of epilepsy in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) and the lack of sustained effects of current treatments, we stress that new approaches are necessary to better care for this group of individuals. We provide a review of the latest emerging therapies for CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), including clinical trial medications and novel treatment approaches under development. Our data complement efforts toward defining treatment guidelines for CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), with the hope of adding disease-modifying therapies to the treatment arsenal in the near future.
