0,methods0," 2.1. Subjects  Patients included in this retrospective observational study were consecutively selected among those attending the Diabetes Unit of the Division of Endocrinology, CTO Andrea Alesini Hospital, ASL Roma 2, Rome, Italy, between April 2018 and June 2020, who followed the inclusion criteria and accepted to adhere to a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) or a low calorie diet (LCD) nutritional program. Importantly, patients were free to choose either a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) or low calorie diet (LCD) nutritional program, after a careful explanation of the two dietary protocols.  Upon admission, all patients signed an informed consent form in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GPDR, 2016/679). Antidiabetic therapy (with the exception of metformin) was stopped concomitantly with the beginning of dietary regimens (very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) or low calorie diet (LCD)).",15ddcfed-9829-40da-ab51-11b1385a7e39
1,methods1," Patients were examined once every month during the first 6 months from the beginning of the intervention (T0), then after 9 and 12 months from T0. Anonymized data were obtained from electronic medical records (Smart Digital Clinic–Meteda SRL, San Benedetto del Tronto, Italy) at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1) and 12 months (T2) after the beginning of the nutritional regimen. Inclusion criteria were: T2DM, defined as HbA1c > 6.5% (48 mmol/L) or fasting plasma glucose (fasting plasma glucose (FPG)) level ≥ 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L), plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) 2 h after the ingestion of 75 mg of glucose, or the use of glucose-lowering medications; fairly good metabolic control (HbA1c < 8.5%) at the beginning of intervention, allowing for suspension of oral therapy (except for metformin); body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m2; nutritional follow-up for at least 12 months.",73e8615f-2194-4190-9ef2-896bb3ec61b7
2,methods2," Exclusion criteria: current treatment with steroids or antineoplastic agents; type 1 diabetes; β-cell failure in T2DM, insulin therapy or concomitant use of sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (risk for euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis); diabetes with severe chronic complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy; psychiatric disturbances; pregnancy; lactation; kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGlomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)) < 60 mL/min); liver failure; heart failure (NYHA III-IV); respiratory failure; planned surgeries; unstable angina or cardiac arrhythmias; recent stroke or myocardial infarction (<12 months) [16,17,18]. Antidiabetic medications could be modified throughout the study, according to HbA1c levels and plasma glucose monitoring.  2.2. Laboratory Assay and Anthropometric Parameters  Fasting glycemia, HbA1C, lipid profile, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and renal function were measured.",8b9ea7e9-7588-40af-81c7-7ae134989895
3,methods3," Glomerular Filtration Rate (Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)) was calculated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation [19]. Ketosis was confirmed by β-Hydroxybutyrate capillary blood detection by using a portable meter (GlucoMen LX Sensor, A. Menarini Diagnostics, Neuss, Germany; sensitivity <0.2 mmol/L). The threshold value for nutritional ketosis is blood ketone levels of 0.5 mg/dL [20].  Anthropometric measurements were obtained from each patient after a 12 h overnight fast and while wearing a hospital gown. Body weight (kg) was measured to the nearest 0.01 kg, using an accurate balance scale (Invernizzi, Rome, Italy). Height (m) was measured using a stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm (Invernizzi, Rome, Italy). body mass index (BMI) was calculated according to Quetelet Index (calculated as body weight divided by height squared (kg/m2)). Waist and hip circumferences (cm) were taken using a flexible steel metric tape to the nearest 0.5 cm.",0256f76d-301d-47ee-bac7-cb4c2a609ce4
4,methods4," Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest. Hip circumference was measured at the greatest posterior protuberance of the buttocks [21]. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured at baseline and at all timepoints of the study.  2.3. Quality of Life  The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36) is an effective measure of Health-Related Quality of Life. The SF-36 measures eight scales: physical functioning (PF), role—physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role—emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Each scale score ranges 0–100, where a value of 100 suggests absence of disability.",8bab7e54-1d74-48ea-8f5b-745411edb555
5,methods5," Component analyses showed that there are two distinct concepts measured by the SF-36: a physical dimension, represented by the Physical Component Summary (Physical Component Summary (PCS)), and a mental dimension, represented by the Mental Component Summary (Mental Component Summary (MCS)). All scales contribute in different proportions to the scoring of both Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) measures [22]. The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ)) is a well-validated questionnaire for measuring eating behaviors. It investigates three eating-related constructs: dietary restraint, disinhibition, and susceptibility to hunger [23]. Karlsson et al. revised the test to a 18-item questionnaire, the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ)-R18 [24]. The results were collected in three areas: cognitive restraint (6 items), uncontrolled eating (9 items) and emotional eating (3 items). According to Lauzon et al.",efd2d6cf-d77e-4c22-a758-c625e28edb5e
6,methods6,", each item was scored from 1 to 4 and the scores were added together to obtain scores for cognitive restraint (range score 6–24), uncontrolled eating (range score 9–36) and emotional eating (range score 3–12) [25]. Restraint refers to the individual ability to restrict food intake. Uncontrolled eating refers to overeating and to the inability to control food intake. Emotional eating refers to propensity to eat in order to feel better [26]. Finally, adherence to the diet was investigated with a nonvalidated questionnaire, which was adapted from the Mediterranean Diet Score [27], indicating scarce adherence when score ranges from 0–5, moderate adherence when score ranges from 5–9 and good adherence when score ranges from 9–14.  2.4.",a4a87e07-4c6b-45e1-ad53-e7c696097c17
7,methods7," Nutritional Intervention  All patients who were willing to adhere to a strict dietary regimen including nutritional supplements and replacement meals, and did not present contraindications to very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), underwent a multiple-phase very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) protocol with the use of replacement meals (Therascience, New Penta SRL or Pronokal Group, each brand containing comparable amounts of calories and similar macronutrient composition) and were strictly followed by a nutrition specialist at the Diabetes Center.  In the first phase (45 days) total daily energy intake was < 800 kcal, with a protein daily intake between 1.2 and 1.5 g per kg of ideal body weight to prevent lean mass loss. During this first phase, patients ate four or five replacement meals per day, according to their specific nutritional needs.",f4458d65-efa6-4b6b-a88a-41b207e30039
8,methods8," In the second phase (45 days), one and subsequently two replacement meals were replaced with conventional food containing proteins (meat, fish, eggs, soy) at lunch and/or dinner. During the first two phases, carbohydrate intake was drastically restricted to induce ketosis and lipid intake was very low and mostly derived from olive oil (≈20 g per day). Recommended water intake was at least 2.5 lt/day. To avoid micronutrient deficiencies, mineral and vitamin supplements were recommended and only erythritol or steviol glycosides were allowed as sweeteners [28]. The maximal duration of the first two phases (ketosis phases) was 3 months (T1). The length of these phases was personalized according to the weight loss target [16].  In the subsequent phases, caloric daily intake was gradually increased and a gradual carbohydrate reintroduction was carried out, starting with low glycemic index carbohydrates.",23cfdca4-51e6-43a5-8a76-dd3d76b4bf22
9,methods9," At the end of 6 months, all patients had reintroduced all types of carbohydrates (fruits, dairy products, legumes, bread and cereals). From months 6 to 12, patients followed a balanced maintenance diet, with a daily calorie intake between 1500 and 2000 kcal, according to the patient’s metabolic needs. It was essential during diet protocol to promote a gradual and personalized introduction of physical activity and a healthy lifestyle. The entire nutritional protocol lasted for at least 12 months (T2).  The low calorie diet (LCD) was based upon a daily reduction in energy intake of 500–1000 kcal, compared to each individual’s basal metabolic rate (estimated via the Harris–Benedict equation).",e0fb988a-810c-464c-a398-9d158869b1cc
10,methods10," Macronutrient dietary composition consisted on a daily intake of 30% of calories coming from fat (saturated fat <7% kcal/day; polyunsaturated fatty acids, 10–20% kcal/day and monounsaturated fatty acids, 10–20% kcal/day; cholesterol consumption <300 mg/day), 20– 25% from protein and 45–50% from carbohydrates. Fiber daily intake was 25–30 g. Sodium daily intake was <5 g. The nutritional plan consisted of five daily meals, according to the Mediterranean nutritional approach. The protein source was mainly represented by legumes, eggs and fish, whereas whole grains, fruits and fresh vegetables represented the main source of carbohydrates [29]. The low-calorie diet used in our protocol was not isocaloric with the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD). Daily total calorie intake as well as macronutrient composition was assessed through MètaDieta software version 4.1 (Meteda SRL, San Benedetto del Tronto, Italy).  2.5.",5cfce716-6ff9-4dd8-8d73-56a15863161e
11,methods11," Statistical Analysis  Thirty consecutive patients who satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria for very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and low calorie diet (LCD) in the planned period were included in this retrospective observational study. All data considered for statistical analysis were retrieved from existing clinical records. Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE). Normality was assessed with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Independent Samples t Tests were calculated for each variable with a normal distribution to compare metabolic and anthropometric values in patients following very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) versus those following low calorie diet (LCD). Within each diet group, paired t tests were used to test whether the changes from baseline to 3 and 12 months were significantly different from zero.",05d15afa-ca7c-45ba-8dbe-dcbfcd2bc567
12,methods12," Mean values of anthropometric and biochemical parameters at baseline, T1 and T2 in very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and low calorie diet (LCD) groups were compared using t-paired test. Bonferroni post hoc analysis was used to compare parameters at different timepoints, and the new level of statistical significance depended upon the number of comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)) software (version 20, IBM, Armonk, New York, NY, USA).  3. Results  Thirty patients who followed the entire nutritional protocol, and whose data were complete, were selected for the study; fifteen patients followed a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), fifteen followed a low calorie diet (LCD) regimen and both groups underwent the same assessments and follow-up throughout the course of the study.

The mean weight at baseline was 111.6 ± 19.8 in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group and 91.6 ± 18.7 in the low calorie diet (LCD) group, whereas mean body mass index (BMI) was 39.5 ± 6.0 kg/m2 and 32.2 ± 4.3 kg/m2, respectively. The duration of diabetes was similar between groups (2.53 ± 1.19 years in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group and 2.47 ± 1.36 years in the low calorie diet (LCD) group). The baseline anthropometric measures (weight, body mass index (BMI), WC and HC) were significantly higher in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group, whereas waist–hip ratio (WHR) was not different between the two groups, with a predominantly abdominal fat distribution observed in both groups (waist–hip ratio (WHR) 1.00 ± 0.11 in very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group and 0.97 ± 0.05 in low calorie diet (LCD) group, Table 1).",175f57fe-a213-4412-9ed3-543e507b5d87

Antidiabetic medications taken at baseline and at the end of the nutritional protocol in very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and low calorie diet (LCD) groups are reported in Table 2. At baseline, in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group, only one patient was not taking any antidiabetic medication and was following a hypocaloric diet. All other patients who entered the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) protocol were taking metformin or metformin in combination with sulphonylurea, GLP-1 agonist, SGLT2-inhbitors or DPP4-inhibitors. At T2, 4 patients (26.6%) in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group had stopped all antidiabetic medications, including metformin, whereas 11 patients (73.3%) were taking only metformin.",f39a57b0-7a58-4976-a7b7-f78fd233ae4e
15,methods15," Mean number of antidiabetic medications was significantly decreased in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group compared to the low calorie diet (LCD) group. In fact, at baseline, all patients were taking only metformin in the low calorie diet (LCD) group, whereas 7 patients (46.6%) had to increase antidiabetic therapy at T2.  In the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group, a significant weight-loss was observed at 3 (8.5% from baseline, p = 0.000) and 12 months (11.5% from baseline, p = 0.000), whereas no significant weight change was observed in the low calorie diet (LCD) group (p = 0.706 at T1, p = 0.623 at T2). Anthropometric measures (body mass index (BMI), WC and HC) were significantly reduced at T1 and T2 in very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) patients (body mass index (BMI) T0-T1: 39.5 ± 6.0 vs. 35.9 ± 5,3, p = 0.000; body mass index (BMI) T2: 34.8 ± 4.04, p = 0,000 vs. T0; WC T0-T1: 118.2 ± 9.0 vs. 113,8 ± 7.5, p = 0.000; WC T2: 114.5± 6,68, p = 0.002 vs.",b19aaed2-94af-4636-bb91-c9d82be037c5

In the low calorie diet (LCD) group, the lipid profile remained substantially unchanged. Fasting plasma glucose was reduced at T1 (p = 0.024) and T2 (p = 0.009) in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group; in the low calorie diet (LCD) group, fasting plasma glucose was unchanged at T1 (p = 0.198) and was numerically lower at T2 (p = 0.071), although the decrease was not statistically significant. HbA1c was significantly reduced in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group at both timepoints, whereas minimal and not statistically significant changes were observed in the low calorie diet (LCD) group.",cae1d3ba-20a9-4bfd-84b9-465d85ee1cf6
17,methods18," Finally, creatinine and transaminases were unchanged in both groups at all timepoints (Table 3). There was no clear evidence of sex differences in any of the outcomes within each diet group; however, a subgroup analysis has not been performed due to the small number of patients.  Mean weight loss from baseline (T0) to T1 (i.e., the end of the ketosis phase for the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group) was 9.51 ± 7.13 Kg in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group, whereas it was 0.31 ± 3.08 kg in the low calorie diet (LCD) group. At T2, mean weight loss was 12.93 ± 8.84 and 0.58 ± 4.18 kg in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and low calorie diet (LCD) groups, respectively. At T1, HbA1c was decreased by 0.69 ± 0.65% in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group and by 0.42 ± 0.01% in the low calorie diet (LCD) group (difference not statistically significant).

In both groups, HbA1c was slightly increased between T1 and T2, probably due to a lower adherence of patients during the maintenance phases of both nutritional regimens. All data mentioned above are reported in Table 4.  Graphical representation of mean weight loss and body mass index (BMI) reduction (±SE) throughout the entire study in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and low calorie diet (LCD) groups is shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.  Figure 3 shows the mean variation in HbA1c (expressed as percentage values) at baseline, T1 and T2, in both the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and low calorie diet (LCD) groups.

The baseline mean score for “emotional eating” (i.e., the susceptibility to internal or external hunger signs, score ranging between 3–12) was 8.8 ± 1.93 and 8.47 ± 2.13 in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and low calorie diet (LCD) groups, respectively. At T1, the cognitive restraint score increased (p < 0.01), whereas both the uncontrolled eating and emotional eating scores decreased (p < 0.001) in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group (Figure 4).

20,methods21,"001) at 3 months (T1) (Figure 5 and Figure 6).  Between T1 and T2, uncontrolled eating and emotional eating scores slightly increased in both groups; this was probably due to a lower adherence to the diet regimen after the first timepoint of observation (Figure 5 and Figure 6).  The mean values for each scale of the quality of life assessment were lower at baseline in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group compared to the low calorie diet (LCD) group. In fact, the mean scores in very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group were lower than 50 (except for role emotional), suggesting a poor quality of life and major disability, mostly due to a more severe degree of obesity.",ac328add-ccf8-4dda-9310-27b04eb003c5
21,methods22,"  In the low calorie diet (LCD) group, the lowest scores were observed in the physical functioning, vitality, social functioning and role—emotional areas, suggesting that obesity limited daily activities (dressing, walking, hygiene), reduced energy and increased fatigue, and induced feelings of depression and anxiety.  At T1, physical (p < 0.001) and mental (p < 0.001) health scores were improved in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group. After 12 months, the increases in physical (p < 0.001) and mental (p < 0.001) health scores were maintained in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group (Table 5).  No significant improvement of quality of life was reported in low calorie diet (LCD), both at T1 and T2 (Table 6).  Adherence to the nutritional regimen was higher in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group than in the low calorie diet (LCD) group (T1 p-value = 0.025; T2 p-value = 0.004).",a89f5a8f-9bf3-4135-85ef-31c11c31ab18
22,methods23," In fact, patients in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group showed a higher satisfaction than low calorie diet (LCD) patients, due to rapid weight-loss, reduced sense of hunger and the general feeling of well-being during the ketosis phase. This may help to explain the scarce effects of the low calorie diet (LCD) on weight loss at both points of observation. The scores obtained in adherence tests at T1 and T2 in very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and low calorie diet (LCD) groups are reported in Table 7. No adverse reactions to replacement meals were reported among the patients in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group.  4. Discussion  In this retrospective study we demonstrated that a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) determines a rapid and significant improvement in metabolic parameters, anthropometric measures and quality of life in patients with obesity and T2DM.",7efc5cda-c687-4b14-8d82-05d3b20837f6
23,methods24," These improvements were maintained at 12 months, and were accompanied by a drastic reduction in the requirement for T2DM medications and, in some cases, by T2DM remission. Despite having a similar metabolic profile and lower body mass index (BMI) at the beginning of the study, the subjects in the low calorie diet (LCD) group did not experience the improvements in metabolic and anthropometric parameters observed in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group.  The patients who followed a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) showed a higher adherence to the prescribed nutritional regimen, compared to patients in the low calorie diet (LCD) group, probably due to the rapid weight loss, feeling of satiety and well-being, and user friendliness of the meal-replacement protocol, experienced by the former group.",e70b11d0-0d2e-4e47-81ae-befb0fe0a72f
24,methods25,"  The lower adherence of patients to the low calorie diet (LCD) regimen may explain the scarce effects on weight loss and metabolic parameters observed at both 3 and 12 months, and represents a limitation of the study.  Due to the threatening increase in the prevalence of T2D and obesity [30], effective strategies are necessary for weight loss and maintenance [31,32,33]. Although bariatric surgery is an effective treatment option for patients with T2DM and obesity, its invasiveness, high costs, long waiting lists and potential complications limit its widespread use. Therefore, pharmacological and lifestyle-based management represent a valuable option for the majority of patients with diabesity [34]. However, dietary regimens are often characterized by limited efficacy in weight loss and poor adherence in the majority of patients. Alternative dietetic strategies have been introduced in order to obtain greater weight loss and higher adherence.",7b23b260-8856-4f45-bc3f-4a91d1259d0e
25,methods26," Several studies have shown that a marked improvement in glycemic control can be achieved through a drastic caloric restriction using a very-low-calorie diet [35,36,37]. In particular, very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is a valid approach in people affected by obesity and T2DM [15,16,17,38], since it promotes satiety, rapid weight loss, and muscle sparing. Importantly, recent studies investigated the role of very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in short-term remission of T2DM [39,40,41]. In a recent meta-analysis, 13 studies were included to investigate the effects of KD on T2DM [42]. They found that after a Ketogenic Diet, the average reduction in fasting glucose was 1.29 mmol/l (95% CI: −1.78 to −0.79), whereas the average reduction of HbA1c was 1.07% (95% CI: −1.37 to −0.78), which is considered a valuable therapeutic goal in the management of diabetes [43]. Unfortunately, the limitation of most of these studies is the absence of long-term data.",e40d536a-1d5a-4718-988e-2af472f5fb8d
26,methods27,"  In this study we demonstrated the beneficial effects of a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in the management of diabetes over 12 months, with a decrease or even suspension of antidiabetic treatments observed at the end of the study. In the low calorie diet (LCD) group, the number of antidiabetic medications was increased in almost 50% of the patients, suggesting a strict relationship between failure to adhere to a nutritional regimen and increased need of pharmacological intervention.  In addition, this study investigated changes in eating behavior and quality of life during nutritional therapy. The Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), a common and well-established self-rating questionnaire, measures three aspects of eating behavior: “cognitive restraint”, “disinhibition” and “hunger”.",636c45c1-5d08-441b-aff3-362560ec8828
27,methods28," In the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group, the uncontrolled eating and emotional eating scores decreased during the ketosis phase, in keeping with the established role of ketone bodies in suppressing hunger. Likewise, the poor adherence to the low calorie diet (LCD) was probably due to an increased appetite in the low calorie diet (LCD) group. Importantly, the continuous sense of hunger or lack of a satiety effect of most dietary regimens favors erroneous eating behaviors and weight gain.  Between T1 and T2, very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) patients showed a mild increase in uncontrolled eating and emotional eating scores and a reduction in cognitive restraint scores, probably due to the reintroduction of carbohydrates, inducing a lower sense of satiety and increased appetite.",279f1d71-7739-4afc-bb78-e9d17d8a362c
28,methods29,"  Finally, the mean score of each of the SF36-items was significantly increased in the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group throughout the study, suggesting a general improvement of the quality of life (reduction in physical pain, improvement of daily activities and better mental health). Conversely, the perception of quality of life remained globally unchanged in the low calorie diet (LCD) group.  No clinically significant side effects were observed in patients treated with very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), apart from mild constipation and dizziness in the first week of the regimen. Kidney and liver function parameters remained unchanged during the diet protocol, in accordance with the reported safety characteristics of this regimen [12].  Meaningful limitations exist in this study. First of all, the number of patients is small to draw solid conclusions.",21ebe064-7cc0-49e0-ba9a-99d2424bd1f4
29,methods30," Importantly, the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and low calorie diet (LCD) groups differed in mean baseline body mass index (BMI) and anthropometric measures: such differences may be explained by the fact that diabetic patients affected by more severe degrees of obesity were more likely to accept and to adhere to a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) regimen. Notably, in this study all patients were free to choose to follow a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) or low calorie diet (LCD) nutritional program. This may represent a bias of the study; indeed, patients who chose the low calorie diet (LCD) protocol were probably less motivated to adhere to a strict nutritional regimen and actually showed less inclination to change their eating habits.",adf7fc90-4849-4a19-b053-8c3083594371
30,methods31," In fact, adherence to the nutritional regimen was significantly lower in the low calorie diet (LCD) group, which was not unexpected, since in clinical practice diabetic patients often show a poor adherence to nutritional interventions and lifestyle modifications.  5. Conclusions  The present work is a retrospective observational study, and should be considered as a real-world evidence study, which evaluated in a hospital clinical practice setting the effectiveness of different diet strategies for the management of diabetic patients. The study confirms that very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) represents a safe and effective tool in the management of obesity and T2DM, also in accordance with the American Diabetes Association recommendations [38].",e0dde627-326c-497f-a61e-a1d243313ab4
31,methods32," Due to its beneficial metabolic effects, very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) should be regarded as a safe and effective strategy of lifestyle intervention and metabolic rehabilitation in properly selected and motivated patients affected by obesity and T2DM [16], which can lead to a decrease, or even suspension, of pharmacological therapy, potentially causing remission of the disease.
