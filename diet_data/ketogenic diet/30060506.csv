0,introduction0,"Pancreatic cancer causes severe morbidity and has a high mortality rate because its early stage diagnosis is difficult and it presents a high risk of metastasis1. The 5-year survival rate (from 2004 to 2010) of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the United States was only 7%2. While only 15–20% of patients with pancreatic cancer are eligible for tumour resection, early detection can increase the 5-year survival rate to ≥ 50%3. Surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer commonly leads to malnutrition, which may result in poor surgical outcomes and an increased toxicity of chemo-/radiation therapy; therefore, postoperative nutritional support in patients with pancreatic cancer is important to improve prognosis4. Cancer-related malnutrition has been associated with a low quality of life, poor muscle function, increased length of hospital stay, high mortality, and surgical complications5. La Torre et al.",7d54c793-0340-46ac-bb0d-5e3d57f34102
1,introduction1," reported that after surgical tumour resection, 88% of patients with pancreatic cancer had a medium-high risk of malnutrition6. These patients had significantly longer recovery times and increased morbidity rates when compared to patients who were at a low risk of malnutrition6.  A ketogenic diet has recently been investigated as an adjuvant cancer treatment7. Allen et al. defined the oral caloric composition of a ketogenic diet as 90% fat, 8% protein, and 2% carbohydrate7. A ketogenic diet is recognized as an effective dietary intervention for neurological diseases, including epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, increasing the levels of ketone bodies such as β-hydroxybutyrate, a major ketone body in blood8. The low carbohydrate and high fat composition of a ketogenic diet can limit glucose utilization in cancer cells7.",6b2ac15f-1dcf-487c-b3f5-953b5daeed3d
2,introduction2," Following ketosis, the levels of the gluconeogenic substrates lactate, pyruvate, and alanine decreased in the blood of cachectic cancer patients while free fatty acids and ketone bodies were increased; thus, ketosis may reduce glucose supply to the tumour while nourishing the patient with alternative energy sources9. Shukla et al. reported that the ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate were associated with inhibited cell growth, reduced glucose uptake, and decreased glutamine and glutamate levels in pancreatic cancer cells; these ketone bodies were also associated with decreased measures of cachexia in patients10. In mice with pancreatic cancer, a ketogenic diet (81% kcal from fat) reduced blood glucose levels, increased ketone levels in the blood and tumour, reduced tumour growth, and alleviated cachexia (45% increase in muscle weight, 20% increase in body weight) in comparison to a control diet10. Schroeder et al.",2c8a3551-475e-4b11-896d-cea20681ebab
3,introduction3," found that 2–5 days of a ketogenic diet in patients with head and neck cancer decreased lactate levels in the tumour, showing that lactate can substitute glucose as an energy source for tumour cells11. Fearon et al. demonstrated that in patients with gastric cancer, lung cancer, or ovarian cancer, a ketogenic diet (44 kcal/kg/day: 70% of energy from medium-chain triglycerides (MCT)) increased body weight by up to 2 kg after 7 days, with no gastrointestinal side effects, whereas a normal diet (55% kcal from carbohydrates and 31% kcal from fat) did not result in any body weight change after 6 days9. Breitkreutz et al. reported that among moderately malnourished patients undergoing chemotherapy for colorectal or gastric cancer, an 8-week fat-enriched liquid diet (66% kcal from fat) in addition to normal meals significantly increased body weight and fat-free mass compared to a normal diet12.",580d9bff-3862-401d-8042-eab9f30431bb
4,introduction4," Therefore, a ketogenic diet has a potential therapeutic effect on cancer and may improve the postoperative nutritional status of patients with cancer who are at risk of malnutrition.  Metabolomics is a powerful tool used to identify metabolic changes in the body and to analyse full sets of metabolites in cells, tissues, and organisms13. Previous metabolomic analyses have suggested that several blood metabolites are markers for pancreatic cancer. Bathe et al. detected increased levels of glutamate, acetone, and β-hydroxybutyrate using 1H and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)) spectroscopy14.",e0221b51-81ea-4328-95b1-e752bbf68c39
5,introduction5," A metabolomics study using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed altered levels of amino acids, fatty acids, bile acids, and lipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) (18:2), phosphatidylcholine (PC) (34:2), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (26:0) associated with pancreatic cancer15. In addition, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) detected changes in metabolites of patients with pancreatic cancer, such as increases in lactate and asparagine levels and decreases in urea and saturated fatty acid levels16, as well as reduced serum 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol and amino acids, including valine, lysine, and tyrosine17. A metabolomics study using flow-injection Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry detected changes in serum glycerophospholipids (glycerophospholipids (GPL)) in pancreatic cancer patients18.",008d8206-44f1-4f3f-aca1-f0de4f354894
6,introduction6," Metabolomics can be used to evaluate the effects of a dietary intervention on metabolic profiles of living organisms19, and metabolic profiles after dietary intervention have been investigated in patients and in mouse models of cancer20. One metabolomics study compared the effects of 6 weeks of a whole grain rye and rye bran-rich diet with a refined white wheat diet in 17 patients with prostate cancer20. However, to the best our knowledge, there are no metabolomics studies on the impact of a ketogenic diet in patients who have undergone pancreatectomy for pancreatobiliary cancer.  The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the postoperative effects of a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)) on the serum metabolic profiles in patients who underwent pancreatectomy for pancreatobiliary cancer, compared to a general hospital diet (GD).

29,discussion0,"The data demonstrated that our low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) was ketogenic and induced metabolic alterations in postoperative patients with pancreatobiliary (periampullary and distal pancreatic) cancer who underwent pancreatectomy. A ketogenic diet is generally high in fat, at a ketogenic ratio of 3:1 to 4:1, F:C + P (w/w)7. A low glycaemic index treatment and a modified Atkins diet with a 1:1 ketogenic ratio are also used in the Johns Hopkins protocol, which induces ketosis by restricting carbohydrates to 10–20 g/day while not restricting protein, fluid, or energy33. Our low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) targeted a ketogenic ratio of 1.75:1 and a nutritional composition of 15.95 g (4% kcal), 60.00 g (16% kcal), and 132.91 g (80% kcal) of C, P, and F, respectively.

30,discussion1,"  low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) noticeably increased the serum levels of total ketones and β-hydroxybutyrate, suggesting that the ketogenic process was enhanced. In our metabolomics analysis, β-hydroxybutyrate was detected and significantly upregulated by low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), but the change was offset at week 4. This supports the ketogenic effect of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). Clinical cancer studies using ketone-producing diets have shown that ketosis may decrease lactate levels in tumour tissues, reduce tumour-associated markers, and improve body weight in cachectic cancer patients and mice9,10. The anticancer effects of ketone bodies have received attention due to their ineffectiveness as an energy source for cancer cells with altered mitochondrial function35. β-hydroxybutyrate supplementation reduced proliferation in metastatic cancer cells and decreased progression and also increased survival in mice35.",600cb53d-9fa1-4f1b-820d-55e5e8191e4f
31,discussion2," Recently, a β-hydroxybutyrate-induced reduction of the mTOR oncogenic signalling pathway including c-Myc and its target genes has been reported in pancreatic cancer cells36. A β-hydroxybutyrate treatment of pancreatic cancer cells also reduced motility by affecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers, and inhibited inflammatory cytokines36. In addition, β-hydroxybutyrate has been reported to suppress oxidative stress by increasing oxidative stress resistance factors (FOXO3A and MT2) as a part of the inhibitory actions of class I histone deacetylases37. Our low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) study was the first trial to investigate the effects of a postoperative ketogenic diet in patients with pancreatobiliary cancer who underwent pancreatectomy.",84eddd95-9dfc-4edc-a485-4f9fc1fc329b
32,discussion3," Although the 7-day application of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) did not prevent body weight loss when compared to the GD, there were significant alterations in serum metabolites, including those associated with pancreatic cancer. This lack of effect of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) on body weight might have been due to an insufficient duration of the diet. Previous studies indicated that ketogenic diets lasting 7 days or 8 weeks limited body weight loss in cancer patients that experienced weight loss7,11. A well-designed prospective study on the long-term use of a postoperative ketogenic diet in patients with pancreatic cancer is warranted to evaluate the potential role of a ketogenic diet on nutritional statuses perioperatively and in the long-term.  Significant alterations in serum metabolites by low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) were observed postoperatively in patients with pancreatobiliary cancer. Among significantly altered metabolites, 48.8%, 27.5%, 10.",f18ceb95-fc66-4b86-b372-a351be9c46b6
33,discussion4,"8%, 8.8%, and 2.9% were involved in the metabolism of lipids, amino acids, nucleotides, cofactors and vitamins, and carbohydrates, respectively. Our pathway analysis suggested that changes might have occurred in the metabolic pathways for sphingolipids, tryptophan, ascorbate and aldarate, glycerophospholipids (GPL), thiamine, cysteine and methionine, retinol, and starch and sucrose.  Sphingolipids participate as bioactive lipids within cancer cell signal transduction networks to regulate tumour growth, proliferation, migration, and metastasis38. low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) appeared to lower serum levels of C22:1-ceramide, C18-ceramide phosphate, galabiosylceramides, and glucosylceramides in comparison to GD. Previously, significant elevations of specific individual ceramides, which are metabolites of the sphingolipid pathway, were reported in the blood of cancer patients18,31,39,40.",a20ab41a-d6ff-408e-a068-62bb10c65d25
34,discussion5," Serum C24:6-ceramide18 and serum exosome C22:1-ceramide31 levels were upregulated in pancreatic cancer. C18-ceramide phosphate is a type of ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) classified as a sphingolipid. C1P is a key regulator in human pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion41. Galabiosylceramide (d18:1/18:1) was reported to be upregulated in ovarian cancer42. In our study, galabiosylceramide (d18:1/24:0) and galabiosylceramide (d18:1/24:1) levels were found to be lowered by the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). Several glucosylceramides were closely linked to anticancer drug resistance43,44. Unlike the GD, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) might elicit changes in blood ceramide levels against the pancreatic cancer-associated dysregulation of blood metabolites.  glycerophospholipids (GPL)s, including PC, PE, PS, phosphatidylinositol, plasmalogen ethanolamine, and plasmalogen choline play structural roles in the lipid bilayers of cell membranes45.",6315aa6e-c293-4d7b-b3b4-4cfabaac4d82
35,discussion6," The glycerophospholipids (GPL) metabolic pathway has been associated with pancreatic cancers46. PC(16:0/22:6) was downregulated in the serum of patients with pancreatic cancer18 but was elevated by our low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). PC(14:0/P-18:0), which was upregulated in breast cancer47,48, colon cancer, oesophageal cancer, and stomach cancer tissues48, was lowered by low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). Longnecker et al. showed that dietary choline supplementation in rats alleviated pancreatic cancer lesions compared with a choline-free diet49. In our study, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) increased serum levels of lysoPC(18:2). Reports on lysoPC(18:2) levels in patients with pancreatic cancer are inconsistent, showing reduced serum lysoPC(18:2)13,18 and increased plasma lysoPC(18:2)15. Moreover, when glycerophospholipids (GPL) is degraded, various bioactive lipid mediators are produced, such as phosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)50.",67fcde1d-d8ae-4358-90d2-89fab19ca10f
36,discussion7," Plasma LPA was elevated in patients with ovarian cancer51, but LPA 18:2 was significantly downregulated in human colon cancer tissues compared with non-cancerous tissues52. Our low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) increased LPA 18:2 in patients with pancreatic cancer. Partial reversion of the behaviour of glycerophospholipids (GPL) metabolites such as PC(16:0/22:6) and PC(14:0/P-18:0) by low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) might suggest that low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) induced some changes in glycerophospholipids (GPL) metabolism against pancreatobiliary cancer.  A low carbohydrate and high fat diet is known to reduce glucose and ATP supplies for pancreatic cancer cells, inhibiting their growth and proliferation10. Alternatively, ketogenesis may occur with liver glycogen depletion and fatty acid oxidation53. We searched for low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD)-induced changes in metabolites of the glucose metabolism.",3141dfec-f6b7-45a8-90a6-b2698d0a5924
37,discussion8," An upregulation of G1P was detected in the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) group, which might suggest glycogen degradation by the ketogenic diet-induced elevation in ketone bodies. G1P, derived from glycogen through glycogen phosphorylase, plays an important role in glycolysis, pentose synthesis, ATP generation, and fatty acid synthesis54. Another metabolite, 2-isopropylmalic acid, an intermediate of pyruvate metabolism synthesized from acetyl-CoA, was increased by low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), although it is downregulated in colon cancer-initiating cells55.  Vitamins and amino acid metabolites were also regulated by low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). Adenosine, inosine, L-tryptophan, 1-methylhistidine, and creatinine levels were lowered with low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). Serum adenosine was upregulated in pancreatic cancer patients18.",8fb6e776-4adb-4e7c-ba20-a4574afc39df
38,discussion9," Inosine, detected by GC- and LC-MS-based metabolomic analyses, was upregulated in plasma samples from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma15. Serum tryptophan was upregulated in a pancreatic cancer mouse xenograft and 1-methylhistidine was upregulated in murine pancreatic tumour tissue46. In patients with pancreatic cancer, the serum creatinine level was found to be elevated using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy metabolomic profiling56 but was found to be decreased when analysed by GC-MS17. However, retinoic acid, N-arachidonoyl glycine, gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine, citicoline, uric acid, and citrulline levels were elevated with low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). The increased level of retinoic acid was associated with cell cycle arrest and a synergistic effect on apoptosis when combined with chemotherapeutic treatment in pancreatic cancer cells57.",5e386d5f-9a45-46a3-9908-109914f3e502
39,discussion10," N-Arachidonoyl glycine exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in rat ear oedema and peritonitis models58. Gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine, an organic selenium compound, showed an anti-cancer effect in a rat model of colon cancer59. A protective effect of citicoline on colitis has been reported in rats, related to its contribution to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms60. Uric acid was downregulated in patients with pancreatic cancer compared with healthy participants16. Citrulline was decreased in patients with pancreatic cancer in an LC-MS-based plasma profiling study32. Overall, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) might partially provide beneficial effects against pancreatic cancer.  Animal studies have shown increased survival rates with a ketogenic versus non-ketogenic diet; however, few human clinical studies have investigated this61. Anti-cancer effects of ketogenic diets were evidenced in animal studies by a clear reduction in tumour mass61.",2055796a-3b3d-4268-903c-a89712ed7c3c
40,discussion11," A ketogenic diet (C:P:F = 0.76%:8.36%:78.8%) reduced tumour growth and improved survival compared to a standard chow diet (composition unknown) in glioma cancer cell-implanted mice (median survival days: ketogenic diet = 25 days, standard diet = 19 days)62. A ketogenic diet supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids and MCTs (C:P:F = 0.2%:13.0%:35.5%) delayed tumour formation in human gastric cancer cell-implanted mice compared with a standard diet (C:P:F = 36.4%:23.8%:7.0%) (g/100 g diet)63. low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) might provide anti-cancer effects by reducing the proliferation of any residual postoperative cancer cells. Based on the present study, a prospective randomized clinical trial evaluating the impact of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) on survival in patients with pancreatobiliary cancers is necessary.",44758020-796d-471a-901b-945b6d6d3587
41,discussion12,"  Although the present study was a phase I prospective clinical trial demonstrating the safety and feasibility of the postoperative use of an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and its effects on the metabolomics of patients with pancreatobiliary cancer, there are several limitations to this study. First, the study population is small due to the high exclusion and withdrawal rates. The measurement of ketone bodies might have provided more insight if more frequent and using other sources (e.g. urinary). The present metabolomic analysis was highly validated by the OPLS-DA model, suggesting that our results show significant differences between GD and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD). As a novel metabolomics study on the application of a post-surgery dietary intervention in patients with cancer, our results may provide useful data for further research.",a511dac3-e443-4a88-923c-51fca47282ab
42,discussion13,"  In summary, our study successfully demonstrated that low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) with 80% kcal from fat induced moderate ketosis by increasing postoperative serum total ketones and β-hydroxybutyrate in patients with cancer. In addition, an low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) might revert some pancreatic cancer metabolite biomarkers, such as C22:1-ceramide, lysoPC (18:2), uric acid, citrulline, and inosine, and might also affect the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and vitamins. The low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) used in our study might provide potential benefits to patients with pancreatobiliary cancer who undergo pancreatectomy. Further studies are mandatory to ascertain the effects of the serum metabolite changes induced by low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD).",e5bc650b-ddd9-42d6-9688-b86057e99ca7
