0,background0,"Glaucoma is a chronic optic neuropathy that progressively damages the optic nerve (ON) and leads to retinal ganglion cell (retinal ganglion cell (RGC)) loss [1, 2]. It is one of the leading causes of irreversible vision loss worldwide [3]. A critical risk factor for ON damage is elevated intraocular pressure (intraocular pressure (IOP)), but how retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dysfunction and degeneration occurs is not fully understood [4, 5].  Energy compromise can contribute to axon loss through axon degeneration initiated by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase-2 (NMNAT2) depletion [6] exacerbated by loss of membrane potential that initiates Ca++ dysregulation and cytoskeletal breakdown [7]. NMNAT2 loss could critically tie axon maintenance and metabolism with the optic neuropathy of glaucoma. Our recent studies in the DBA/2J (D2) model of glaucoma revealed that ONs of D2 mice are metabolically vulnerable and exhibit chronic metabolic stress [8].",9ab53a51-7c8e-4114-94d2-9b6adba1d82f
1,background1," The D2 ON exhibited lower ATP levels, low substrate availability, transporter downregulation, and mitochondrial defects [8–10]. Axonal metabolic decline can be reversed through increased substrate availability and upregulation of monocarboxylic transporters as a result of placing mice on a ketogenic diet [8]. A ketogenic diet is primarily composed of fat with a moderate level of protein and little to no carbohydrate. Ketogenic diet induces hepatic ketogenic metabolism and produces ketone bodies, primarily β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) [11]. Ketogenic diet has been used as a therapy for neurological disorders, including in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and in animal models of multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [12–16]. An ongoing clinical trial has used ketogenic diet to treat Alzheimer’s disease (study ID: NCT02912936), leading to reduction of short-term memory loss [17].",a1199c26-10b9-49e6-82a0-33d40b679ccc
2,background2," The exact mechanism of action of ketogenic diet in neuroprotection is not entirely known. Recent studies suggested ketogenic diet attenuates oxidative stress, inhibits class I histone deacetylases, promotes Nrf2 activation to upregulate antioxidants, and inhibits NF-κB to limit inflammation [18, 19]. In the treatment of epilepsy, the ketogenic diet inhibits neuronal activation through, among other changes, increased GABAergic output and lowered presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitter release [20].  AMP-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) is a ubiquitously expressed Ser/Thr kinase that acts as an energy sensor by monitoring the AMP/ATP level and regulates cellular metabolism through ATP restoration [21]. In addition to acting as a key regulator of cellular energy dynamics, activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling is involved in regulating inflammation.",cce5da2d-3aa9-44c3-b431-73beaa019dcd
3,background3," Studies suggest activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling regulates NF-κB activation, enabling release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [22, 23]. NF-κB is a critical regulator of inflammatory response and immunity. There are five family members of NF-κB, including NF-κB p50, NF-κB p52, NF-κB p65, RELB, and c-REL that can form homo- and hetero-dimers [24]. The most conventional dimer form is the NF-κB p65-p50 heterodimer that remains bound to the IκB family of inhibitory proteins in the cytoplasm [25]. Phosphorylation of the NF-κB/IκB complex on IκB serine residues results in dissociation of IκB from NF-κB, leading to NF-κB p65 translocation to the nucleus. The translocated NF-κB p65 binds to DNA sequences in the promoter regions of specific genes such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), inducing their transcription [26].",b4151b22-ec0f-4ada-9bc7-7cc2bd244d8b
4,background4,"  Lactate or ketone bodies produced from the ketogenic diet can bind and activate hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors (HCARs). Three receptor subtypes have been identified: HCAR1 (also known as GPR81), HCAR2 (GPR109A), and HCAR3 (GPR109B). The HCAR3 subtype is evolutionary lost in rodents [27]. The HCARs are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) associated with downregulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) through Gi signaling that inhibits lipolysis in adipocytes [28]. HCAR expression is not confined to adipocytes but is also present on neutrophils, on tissue macrophages, in the brain on neurons and astrocytes of the hippocampus and the cerebellum, and in the retina, including on Müller glia [27, 29, 30]. HCAR activation by lactate or ketone bodies has a direct anti-inflammatory effect. Lactate activation of HCAR1 reduces liver and pancreatic injuries via inhibition of inflammasome-mediated inflammation [31].",252db8e8-3d17-4fd5-b7cd-249b55504d6b
5,background5," Stimulation of HCAR2 by βHB in a mouse model of stroke induces neuroprotection via the activity of bone marrow-derived macrophages that infiltrate the brain [32]. Studies suggested the anti-inflammatory effect of lactate is solely dependent on HCAR1 and its adapter protein Arrestin β-2 (ARRB2), which ultimately reduces the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome [32]. Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation prevents proteolytic cleavage and activation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, the gatekeeper cytokine that regulates most of the inflammatory response [33].  Low energy can drive inflammation [22]. Compromised energy has been observed in glaucoma [8]; additionally, inflammation has been implicated in the mechanism of glaucomatous cell dysfunction and death [34].",515d608f-40c3-4245-943d-9d7b085967d8
6,background6," In this study, we investigated whether the metabolic vulnerability observed in glaucoma contributes to an extended inflammatory response, then tested the hypothesis that the ketogenic diet resolves the inflammatory response in glaucoma. Our data indicate that low energy drives inflammation in D2 chronic glaucoma mice as shown by phosphorylation of activated protein kinase (AMPK) that leads to activation of NF-κB and cytokine production and release. Treatment with the ketogenic diet ameliorates inflammation through inhibition of activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and HCAR1-mediated inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

7,methods0,"Animals Both sexes of DBA/2J (D2) and DBA/2J-Gpnmb + (D2G) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and housed at Northeast Ohio Medical University. The D2 mouse has mutations in the Tyrp1 and Gpnmb genes that cause iris stromal atrophy and iris pigment dispersion disease, leading to age-related elevation of intraocular pressure and ocular hypertension-related retinal ganglion cell death [35]. The D2G mouse shares the D2 genetic background but carries a wildtype allele of the Gpnmb gene and does not develop pigmentary glaucoma. These experiments used 34 D2 mice split across two treatment groups and 6 D2G mice (Table 1).

Mice were anesthetized (2.5% isoflurane delivered by vaporizer with oxygen) prior to intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement and 10–15 measures were taken, and values were averaged. Both baseline and terminal intraocular pressure (IOP) were measured for untreated and keto D2 and D2G mice (Table 1). All intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were carried out within 3 min of anesthetization in order to avoid any anesthetic-induced reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) [36].  Diets Both D2 and D2G mice were fed by standard lab chow (Formulab Diet 5008; 26.8% protein, 56.4% carbohydrate, 16.7% fat) ad libitum.

To explore HCAR function in ketogenic diet-induced anti-inflammatory effects in D2 glaucoma mice, we analyzed inflammasome components NLRP3 and expression of IL-1β in keto D2 retina and ON. Consistent with inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, we found significantly decreased levels of Nlrp3 (Fig. 6a) and Il-1β (Fig. 6b) mRNA in keto D2 retina compared to untreated D2 retina.",adb4c3fd-5df5-4ce0-9263-62798b8eae5d
36,results15," We measured NLRP3 and mature IL-1β protein levels by western blot, detecting significantly lower levels of NLRP3 ((Fig. 6c, d) and IL-1β (Fig. 6c, e) in keto D2 retina compared to untreated D2 retina. We also measured IL-1β protein levels in ON by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and detected significantly lower levels in keto D2 ON than untreated D2 ON (Fig. 6f). HCAR1-mediated anti-inflammatory effects are dependent on its adapter protein ARRB2 that acts on the NLRP3 inflammasome and ultimately reduces inflammation [32], so we examined whether ARRB2 expression is induced in keto D2 retina and ON. We detected significantly enhanced levels of ARRB2 protein in keto retina compared to untreated D2 retina (Fig. 6g, h).

39,discussion0,"Inflammation is a major pathophysiological process of secondary damage following central nervous system (CNS) insult, including traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease [46, 47]. Glaucoma is an age-related chronic degenerative disease with inflammatory response reminiscent of many other chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the contribution of metabolic vulnerability to the inflammation evident in D2 glaucoma mouse retina and optic nerve. Our data show that limited energy supply in the D2 ON and retina triggers the primary cellular energy sensor, activated protein kinase (AMPK), that activates NF-κB signaling and consequently induces the observed pro-inflammatory response. Treatment with ketogenic diet satisfies the energy demand, inhibits activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, and reduces inflammation.",fa1d7059-01b6-46dc-9cc2-7df915986e7b
40,discussion1," Lactate or ketones from the ketogenic diet also inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation through the HCAR1 receptor in D2 retina and ON.  Beneficial effects of the ketogenic diet have been reported in many neurodegenerative diseases including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease [48]. Free fatty acids used in epilepsy treatment can reduce IL-1β levels, possibly through activation of PPARα [20], and the ketogenic diet metabolite βHB reduces inflammation [45]. Other than the impact of the diet on inflammation, our recent study showed the ketogenic diet directly impacts energy management by inducing mitochondrial biogenesis, reversing monocarboxylate transporter decline, and inducing a robust antioxidant response. These alterations protect retinal ganglion cell (RGC)s and their axons from degeneration, allowing them to maintain physiological signaling to the brain [8].",3e3320b1-1314-4074-a07b-cd33b7e826fc
41,discussion2," These data accord with evidence that βHB treatment protects cortical neurons through maintenance of neuronal respiratory capacity [49].  We first investigated microglial activation in energy-compromised D2 retina and ON. Studies have indicated that excessive and prolonged activation of microglia leads to degeneration of neurons, including retinal ganglion cell (RGC)s [50, 51]. We detected activated microglia as shown by morphological change, including rounded shape, increased somal size, and ramified clusters in D2 retina and ON, which is consistent with previous studies showing microglia activation in glaucomatous retina and optic nerve head [50, 52]. Next, we examined how low energy in D2 retina and ON triggers inflammation. In low energy conditions, activated protein kinase (AMPK)α1 is activated by phosphorylation of its Threonine 172 residue; it then works to switch cellular processes from an anabolic to a catabolic state, thereby improving energy balance by liberating ATP [53].",cef1d4ea-ec02-46d5-9e16-72acba6157bd
42,discussion3," Our previous study showed activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation early, at 6 months in the D2 ON, when glaucoma pathology is not obvious. activated protein kinase (AMPK) was more highly activated at 10 month of age, indicating sustained activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in the D2 ON [8]. Activated activated protein kinase (AMPK) contributes to mechanisms of inflammation [53]. Knockdown of activated protein kinase (AMPK)α1 reduced LPS-induced NF-κB activation and IL-1β cytokine release [22, 23]. NF-κB is a master transcription factor for the production of cytokines; when activated, NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription of multiple inflammatory cytokines [54, 55]. We observed reduced NF-κB p65 activation and reduced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, and NOS2 after ketogenic diet treatment.",768eea91-c24e-4fec-8c2a-acfa275639aa
43,discussion4," Each of these cytokines has been associated with glaucoma pathogenesis in other studies; for example, TNFα is released by retinal glia and leads to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon degeneration [56] through the upregulation of Ca++-permeable AMPA receptors [57]. IL-6 is synthesized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC)s following elevation of intraocular pressure [58]. IL-1β is upregulated prior to axon degeneration or retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss in the D2 model of glaucoma [52]. Moreover, we observed increased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and Arginase-1 in keto D2 retina and ON. Therefore, our data suggests that the ketogenic diet-induced anti-inflammatory response is due to inhibition of activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated NF-κB signaling in D2 glaucoma mice. Our data are consistent with a recent study showing ketogenic diet-mediated inhibition of NF-κB signaling and attenuation of inflammation after spinal cord injury [18].",0ca730fc-065e-4afc-99f4-93a1c6f2656f
44,discussion5,"  Inflammation has many feed-forward mechanisms for signal amplification, many of which involve cytokine binding to toll-like receptors (TLRs) [59] that promote NF-κB translocation and greater production of cytokines. High levels of TLR expression were reported in glaucomatous human retina as well as in the D2 retina and optic nerve head [60, 61]. Given this, we investigated a pathway downstream of TLR signaling and NF-κB, the NLRP3 inflammasome. An activating signal from a pattern recognition receptor (PRP) on the cell surface leads to the upregulation of NLRP3 as a priming reaction. This activating signal can originate from many different stimuli, including HCAR1 (see below). In fact, mechanical strain of astrocytes, as might occur in optic nerve head glial cells in glaucoma, can trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome [62].",56ff88c5-7a85-456d-aeb8-ae0c8c1956ae
45,discussion6," Activated TLRs stimulate a protein cascade that results in NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, which activates caspase-1, the enzyme responsible for the maturation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β [32, 33]. The reduction in NF-κB signaling in our data indicates that pro-form IL-1β should be reduced, but any existing pools of IL-1β could become mature through NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Interestingly, in the context of type 2 diabetes, the NLRP3 inflammasome is a sensor of metabolic stress [63]. We observed downregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome with the ketogenic diet. Our data also shows that NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition may occur through the activity of lactate and ketone bodies on HCAR1.  Lactate or ketone body binding to the HCARs on macrophages or monocytes can also reduce inflammation [32, 45].",27cf99ac-b188-4e29-8399-0cfb0d0f0e0d
46,discussion7," We detected significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of HCAR1 but not HCAR2 in D2 retina and ON, indicating that ketogenic diet treatment induces HCAR1 expression in glaucoma mice. The HCAR1 expression was observed throughout the retina. Higher levels of HCAR1 have been detected at excitatory synapses than vascular endothelium and astrocytic end feet in the retina, suggesting that HCAR1 signaling is important for various cellular functions including metabolism, synaptic function, and blood flow in the retina [29]. Lactate or ketone body-induced anti-inflammatory effects through HCAR1 require the cytosolic signaling molecule ARRB2 [64]. We observed significantly increased ARRB2 protein levels in both the keto retina and ON, demonstrating that ARRB2 expression is induced by the ketogenic diet. ARRB2 directly interacts with HCAR1 and exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by antagonizing NLRP3 inflammasome pathways [65].",1f072407-62aa-4c48-8611-ba4a0c850a3b
47,discussion8," A co-immunoprecipitation study suggested that ARRB2 interacts directly with NLRP3; accordingly, knockdown of ARRB2 markedly diminishes its ability to inhibit NLRP3 [66]. We observed reduced expression of NLRP3 after the ketogenic diet treatment in D2 retina and ON, which suggests lactate or ketone bodies trigger HCAR1-ARRB2 signaling to reduce the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Our findings are consistent with the study showing HCAR1-mediated inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome in liver and pancreatic injury [31]. βHB-induced inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages was shown to be independent of HCAR2 signaling [45], but the study did not rule out the possibility that HCAR1 could be involved, as our data suggests. We detected significantly reduced levels of mature Il-1β after ketogenic diet treatment that corroborates HCAR1-mediated inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome in D2 glaucoma mice.",dad6537b-bf8a-421d-ab45-f74417d34587
48,discussion9," Knockdown of HCAR1 strongly induces hepatic IL-1β and NLRP3 expression and increases hepatocyte apoptosis, indicating a critical role for HCAR1 in endogenous dampening of inflammatory response [31]. Therefore, our data suggests that the ketogenic diet exerts its anti-inflammatory response in glaucoma not only through the inhibition of activated protein kinase (AMPK)-NF-κB signaling but also via induction of HCAR1-mediated inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome.  Conclusion These data provide evidence that metabolic vulnerability observed in glaucoma contributes to an extended inflammatory response through chronic stimulation of activated protein kinase (AMPK) that activates NF-κB signaling and subsequently induces pro-inflammatory response. Treatment with the ketogenic diet resolves energy demand and ameliorates the inflammation by inhibition of activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and by activating HCAR1 signaling that inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation.",1c03d635-79bc-47dd-8a0f-23f44b578a1c
