0,introduction0,"Mitochondrial disorders can manifest as hepatopathy, mainly in infants, with or without other organ manifestations1. Only supportive treatments, such as adjustment of nutrition and vitamin supplementation to alleviate the metabolic imbalance, are available for these patients1, 2.  Mutations in the BCS1L gene, encoding a complex III (CIII) assembly factor, are the most common diagnosed cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) complex III (CIII) (complex III (CIII)) deficiency3. GRACILE syndrome4 (fetal growth restriction, aminoaciduria, cholestasis, liver iron overload, lactic acidosis, and early death during infancy) is caused by a homozygous missense mutation (c.232 A > G, p.S78G) in BCS1L 5. In liver mitochondria of the patients, Rieske iron-sulfur protein (RISP, UQCRFS1) incorporation into complex III (CIII) is decreased resulting in reduced complex III (CIII) activity6. We have generated a viable mouse model of complex III (CIII) dysfunction by introducing the Bcs1l c.",2f7857bf-3fdb-4a9a-a87a-3b8cd627218c

The homozygous mice display growth failure, low blood glucose, high blood lactate and progressive hepatopathy from the fourth week of age, recapitulating many of the main findings in the patients.  Carbohydrate-restricted high-fat ketogenic diets stimulate mitochondrial β-oxidation and ketone body production in the liver8, 9. Ketone bodies can be utilized as an alternative energy source by the brain, heart and skeletal muscle. KDs are an established therapy in drug-resistant epilepsies and have been shown to increase the expression of genes related to tricarboxylic acid cycle and RC function, as well as the number of mitochondria in rat hippocampi8–10. KDs have been proposed and tested as a therapy for mitochondrial disorders. Krebs et al.",43dad816-2f01-4a2f-8b13-c52816749631
2,introduction2," hypothesized that the course of postweaning-onset mitochondrial cardiomyopathy in Med30 mutant mice is affected by the considerable decrease in fat intake on shifting from maternal milk (42% fat) to the low-fat regular chow. Indeed, the researchers could extend the survival of the mutant mice by 40% by weaning them to high-fat ketogenic diet11. Schiff et al. showed that high-fat diet-fed Harlequin mice with CI deficiency exhibit a slower progression of the neurodegenerative phenotype12. In a mouse model of late-onset mitochondrial myopathy, KD decreased the amount of cytochrome c oxidase negative muscle fibers and prevented mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities in the muscle and normalized metabolic and lipidomic changes13. In a subsequent study by this group a modified Atkins diet caused muscle pain in the myopathy patients and selective lysis of abnormal muscle fibers, which was considered eventually beneficial for the muscle function14.",cf6d2031-ad68-44ca-8815-55daf9b5b001
3,introduction3," Moreover, KD has been shown to increase mitochondrial mass in skeletal muscle13, heart15 and brown adipose tissue16.  With the hypothesis that KD may induce mitochondrial biogenesis to compensate reduced RC function, improve energy metabolism and ameliorate disease progression, we performed a dietary intervention to assess the effect of KD on liver disease in the Bcs1l mutant model of complex III (CIII) dysfunction.

The hepatic expression of two circulating mitochondrial disease markers, Fgf21 18 and Gdf15 19 was up-regulated in Bcs1l G/G mice and Gdf15 expression was normalized by KD (Fig. 4H).",3a4e5609-cf21-44c7-9670-03f3b8a1d9ec
31,results16," Upstream regulatory analysis predicted that KD activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-α,-γ and -α), TFAM and PGC-1α and inhibited CREB, all transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 5D). The observed mRNA level of Ppargc1a (PGC-1α) was increased in the Bcs1l G/G mice but not affected by the diet (Fig. 4G). Expression of a recently identified mitophagy and mitochondrial mass regulator Bnip3 20 was increased 1.4-fold (p = 0.02) and 1.8-fold (p < 0.001) by KD in WT mice and Bcs1l G/G mice, respectively. Bcs1l G/G mice on CD had decreased (-1.6-fold) expression of Bnip3 and related autophagy regulators, Atg3 (−1.8-fold) and Atg5 (−1.5-fold) compared to WT mice on CD (all p < 0.001).  Amino acid and lipid metabolism are altered at transcriptome and metabolite levels in Bcs1lG/G mice The expression of multiple amino acid starvation response genes (i.e. Atf3, Atf4, Ddit3, Trib3, Asns and Txnip) was up-regulated in Bcs1l G/G mice (Supplementary Fig. 9).",9e24295f-8adb-4595-915d-d4a7c80966d6
32,results17," Amino acid metabolism-related genes were enriched in all comparisons (Fig. 5B,C and Supplementary Fig. 10A). Targeted plasma metabolomics revealed elevated concentrations of eight amino acids in the Bcs1l G/G mice (Supplementary Fig. 10B). In line with a probable increase in protein catabolism, gene expression pathway analyses predicted altered urea cycle activity in Bcs1l G/G livers (Fig. 5B,C), and, accordingly, the plasma level of arginine was decreased and ornithine and citrulline increased (Supplementary Fig. 10B).  Gene expression pathway analyses further suggested that hepatic lipid metabolism was profoundly altered by the mutation and the diet (Fig. 5B,C, Supplementary Fig. 11A and Supplementary Table 1). The expression of genes related to ketone body synthesis, bile acid biosynthesis and ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acid metabolism were up-regulated by KD (Fig. 5B,C). Several bile acid biosynthesis-related genes were down-regulated in Bcs1l G/G mice (Fig. 5B,C).",ed265819-9114-4e91-949d-9b3ee10b0bf4
33,results18," Metabolomics analysis showed increased plasma concentrations of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic (Supplementary Fig. 11B). Also, the concentrations of plasma carnitine and short-chain acylcarnitines were decreased by the mutation and KD further indicating altered lipid metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 11B).  KD modulates altered hepatic macrophage populations in Bcs1lG/G mice In H&E-stained liver sections of Bcs1l G/G mice, cells with brownish cytoplasm and morphologically resembling macrophages were observed (Supplementary Fig. 12). These cells were PAS-diastase-positive and auto-fluorescent (Supplementary Fig. 12), suggesting that they were ceroid- or lipofuscin-laden macrophages. The number of these cells was decreased by KD. Immunostaining for macrophage/Kupffer cell markers showed similar number of hepatic macrophages with both F4/80 and IBA1 antibodies in WT mice (Fig. 2D,E).",3fa295d4-111e-4173-a148-c2f35d4d3874
34,results19," F4/80 is an established marker for tissue resident macrophages but some infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages are negative or only weakly immunopositive for F4/8021, 22. In the Bcs1l G/G livers F4/80 staining was reduced suggesting either loss of this marker or Kupffer cell depletion. However, the number of IBA1-expressing macrophages was increased in Bcs1l G/G livers and normalized by KD at P45 (Fig. 2A,E). In Bcs1l G/G livers the macrophages were larger and protruded out of sinusoids, or multiple macrophages surrounded a hepatocyte (Fig. 2A). Neutrophil count was marginally increased in the mutant livers (Supplementary Fig. 13).  Gene expression pathway analyses (Supplementary Table 1) indicated changes in four inflammation related pathways (Reactome database) in the Bcs1l/ G/G mice: formation of fibrin clot, infectious disease, MHC class II antigen presentation and phagosomal maturation (p < 0.0003 for all).",1a174f76-1880-4e3b-b410-30aef93b0e0a
35,results20," Furthermore, one fifth of genes that were up-regulated more than 3-fold in Bcs1l/ G/G mice overlapped with genes that play a role in innate immune response (InnateDB23). For example the macrophage marker gene Cd68 was up-regulated 8.5-fold (p < 0.0001) in the Bcs1l/ G/G mice and downregulated 2.4-fold (p = 0.0046) by KD. Comparison to various published macrophage gene expression profiles showed that most of the highly up-regulated genes in Bcs1l/ G/G livers were linked to activated macrophages (Fig. 6A). KD normalized the majority of these gene expression changes towards WT levels.Figure 6 Ketogenic diet modulates macrophage (MΦ) polarization-related gene expression signatures in Bcs1l G/G mice.

Of these, Tnf expression was significantly normalized by KD (Fig. 6D,E).

40,discussion0,"Low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets are an established treatment in drug-resistant epilepsies. Studies in animal models have suggested that modulation of mitochondria-related functions, including reduced reactive oxygen species production, promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis and stimulation of glutathione biosynthesis contribute to their beneficial effects in the brain8–10. Here, we demonstrate that KD ameliorated hepatopathy in complex III (CIII) deficient Bcs1l mutant mice at the level of liver histology and liver enzymes, mitochondrial structure and function, and gene expression. Marked stellate cell activation and hepatic progenitor cell proliferation24 indicate severe early liver injury in these mice despite relatively modest other histological changes.",9e8e11d3-a920-4b45-86b6-88d52e05d4f1
41,discussion1," KD feeding reduced fibrosis, number of apoptotic/necrotic cells, and attenuated stellate cell and hepatic progenitor cell activation, suggesting that it either reduced the initial insult (complex III (CIII) deficiency), affected fibrogenic processes in the liver or induced protective mechanisms (e.g. detoxification).  We found structural aberrations in mitochondria, the most striking of which was reduced number and increased thickness of cristae, in hepatocytes of Bcs1l G/G mice, and these alterations were prevented by KD. In a previous study, KD was shown to normalize overall mitochondrial structure in skeletal muscle in a mouse model of mitochondrial myopathy13. Mitochondrial cristae are structurally highly dynamic bioenergetic compartments and their shape is linked to RC function25, 26. The reduced number and increased thickness of cristae in hepatocytes of Bcs1l G/G mice on CD might be related to disrupted RC complex organization25.",630a4f0f-acd4-4777-95e3-9a43e06daf70
42,discussion2," Starvation has been shown to cause elongation of mitochondria and both starvation and nonglycolytic substrates cause cristae remodeling, including increase in cristae number and reduced width in cultured cells. This process is thought to increase the efficiency of ATP production27–29. It is tempting to speculate that the carbohydrate-restricted KD might have caused a similar starvation-like or substrate utilization-dependent mitochondrial adaptation in our mouse model, leading to normalization of cristae number and morphology.  To investigate if the normalized mitochondrial morphology reflected improved mitochondrial function, we measured complex III (CIII) activity and assessed organization of respiratory chain complexes and supercomplexes in liver mitochondria. Indeed, complex III (CIII) activity was increased by half in the mice on KD, which may have been sufficient to ameliorate the liver injury due to complex III (CIII) dysfunction.",cfcffc3b-ca19-4e4d-9a1e-f5c081fc7d63
43,discussion3," Previously, a short term (<24 h) KD administration was also shown to increase combined CII and complex III (CIII) activity in brain cortical mitochondria in a rat mode of traumatic brain injury30. Typical markers of mitochondrial mass and biogenesis, such as Ppargc1a expression and citrate synthase activity were modestly increased in the mutant mice but not affected by the diet. MtDNA copy number was similar in all groups and none of the RC subunits analyzed were increased by KD. To the contrary, some RC subunits that were increased by the mutation were decreased to WT levels on KD. Transcriptome changes predicted activation of key regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, PPAR-α,-γ and -α, PGC-1α and TFAM by KD, but apparently this transcriptional response did not result in increased mitochondrial mass. Ketone bodies have been shown to restore complex I stability and activity in a complex I deficient cell line31.",54cd50ea-9353-4038-af23-28921c762d2b
44,discussion4," Therefore, we assessed RC complex and supercomplex amount in liver mitochondria of the mice using Blue native gel electrophoresis (BNGE). Despite that KD did not increase total amount of RISP in whole tissue lysate, more fully assembled complex III (CIII) was found in isolated mitochondria from Bcs1l G/G mice on KD than on CD. This finding suggests improved complex III (CIII) assembly or stability and offers an explanation for the increased complex III (CIII) activity on KD. Dietary fat composition has been shown to affect phospholipid composition of mitochondrial membranes32 and affect respiratory chain supercomplex assembly and function33, 34. Our KD contained a high proportion of polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids, which may have had an effect on mitochondrial membrane composition and, subsequently, on complex III (CIII) and supercomplex composition in our model.",06bb3314-20ca-4af3-8eb7-0a35f8327b7a
45,discussion5,"  Previously, a ketogenic diet, with a more extreme protein restriction than our formulation (see later discussion), decreased liver mitochondrial mass likely by up-regulating gene and protein expression of starvation induced mitophagy factor, BNIP335. We observed that KD increased hepatic Bnip3 expression in both genotypes. The Bcs1l G/G mice on CD had decreased Bnip3 transcript levels compared to WT mice along with reduced mRNA levels of the autophagy regulators Atg3 and Atg5 36. Taken together, our results indicate that the increased complex III (CIII) activity and the beneficial effect of KD were not due to increased liver mitochondrial mass but likely to other adaptive mitochondrial responses such as improved mitochondrial quality control via autophagy and improved maintenance of cristae structure and RC function, including improved complex III (CIII) assembly and activity.",8b3f6a90-1355-47bc-952d-60686c2d8fc4
46,discussion6,"  Hepatic immune cells, including Kupffer cells and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages are key pro- and anti-fibrotic regulators37. The Bcs1l G/G mice had substantially altered liver macrophage populations as shown by immunostainings and macrophage-related gene expression patterns, and these were clearly modulated by the diet. KD also reduced the number of ceroid-lipofuscin-laden macrophages in Bcs1l G/G livers, likely reflecting a reduced need for clearance of cellular debris due to reduced cell death. A reduced number of F4/80 positive macrophages, but increased total macrophage count, has been shown previously in the acute phase of liver injury21, 22. These studies also identified the weakly F4/80-immunopositive subsets as infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages. In contrast, the number of IBA1, CD68 and galectin-3 positive macrophages increases upon liver injury38, 39.",5fb06dc1-56c1-47e3-ac09-654e3f86792a
47,discussion7," We observed depletion of F4/80-expressing macrophages in Bcs1l G/G livers but an increased number of IBA1-positive macrophages, the latter of which was reduced on KD. Expression of galectin-3 (Lgals3) and Cd68 was highly induced in Bcs1l G/G on CD and significantly less so on KD. Of interest, macrophage polarization and their inflammatory properties can be modified by mitochondrial function40. The M1, or classically activated, subset of macrophages is mainly relying on anaerobic glycolysis whereas the M2, or alternative activated subset, is dependent on oxidative phosphorylation. The M2-like subsets are particularly important in tissue repair and resolution of inflammation40. Interestingly, mice with global CI subunit Ndufs4 knock-out have systemic inflammation and osteopetrosis due to shift in macrophage polarization and osteoclast differentiation41.  In our model, components of the KD may have affected liver disease progression via mechanisms unrelated to energy metabolism.",d2ae9df9-28e3-4fe3-ab8f-3005ce4b71f7
48,discussion8," Docosahexanoid acid, a long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acid, can suppress mitochondrial membrane transition pore opening, a key event leading to apoptosis32. Indeed, we found significantly less dying hepatocytes in Bcs1l G/G mice on KD. Certain long-chain fatty acids and their derivatives are ligands for PPAR-α and -γ42. In our KD-fed mice, the expression of several PPAR-α- and PPAR-γ-regulated genes was altered in the liver transcriptome, suggesting that diet-dependent modulation of ligand binding to PPAR-α and -γ may have played a role. Other putative mediators are HCAR2, a receptor for the major ketone body β-hydroxybyturate, expressed in white adipose tissue and some immune cells including macrophages43, 44 and FFAR4 (free fatty acid receptor 4), the activation of which modulates macrophage polarization34, 35. FFAR4 is activated by long-chain fatty acids and our KD formulation provided 2.8-fold more α-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3) relative to energy content than the CD.",5d1083d8-7082-492c-afbf-928735e92d50
49,discussion9," The putative role of these receptors in mediating the effect of the KD should be further studied by administering ketone esters or the respective receptor agonists.  Induction of liver detoxification genes was minimal in Bcs1l G/G mice except for glutathione S-transferase (glutathione S transferase (GST)) genes. glutathione S transferase (GST)s detoxify a variety of compounds, including oxidative stress-induced metabolites such as 4-hydroxynonenal45. Some glutathione S transferase (GST)s also possess peroxidase activity, and as such are antioxidant enzymes. In addition, the majority of glutathione S transferase (GST) genes contain antioxidant response element in their promoter region and are regulatory targets of NRF2, the major oxidative stress responsive transcription factor. The expression of several glutathione S transferase (GST) genes was highly induced in the liver of Bcs1l mice and this induction was partially reversed by KD feeding.",25448084-066c-46d2-a5d3-21af10349ddd
50,discussion10," Interestingly, the gene expression profile of glutathione S transferase (GST)s in Bcs1l G/G mice showed similar induction of cytoplasmic glutathione S transferase (GST) genes as observed in the mouse liver when NRF2 pathway is over activated46. As for oxidative stress, we found up-regulated expression of three genes encoding antioxidant enzymes (Gpx3, Gpx4 and Nqo1) in the liver of Bcs1l G/G mice as well as of glutathione synthetase. Intriguingly, catalase expression was downregulated 1.8 fold (data not shown). KD had no effect on the expression of these genes. In line with the gene expression data liver total glutathione content was increased in Bcs1l mice on CD but reduced to WT levels on KD. We interpret these results so that there was reduced need for detoxification and less cellular glutathione synthesized when the Bcs1l G/G mice were on KD.  A small retrospective study found KD treatment effective and relatively safe in respiratory chain defects related childhood epilepsy9.",ecf7f368-2067-4809-9117-d8ad59d9f5ad
51,discussion11," However, a KD intervention trial in mitochondrial myopathy patients had to be prematurely discontinued due to muscle pain and selective muscle fiber damage47. We found that Bcs1l G/G mice showed eventual intolerance to the diet manifesting as more rapid behavioral decline after eleven weeks of feeding. Depleted glycogen stores might have led to an exacerbated energy crisis. However, blood glucose and lactate values at sacrificing time were not significantly different on the two diets. Common rodent KD formulations contain only 5E% protein and provide inadequate choline and methionine intake48, 49. These KDs cause robust ketosis but also hinder growth of the mice and in some studies have caused adverse liver effects including steatosis48–50. KD formulations with higher protein content are nutritionally more suitable but reduce the ketogenic effect in rodents51.",db95d709-81e6-4b84-8208-9ea7ba2bbe73
52,discussion12," In line with this we observed only transient ketosis in WT mice while the Bcs1l mice remained ketotic during the entire intervention. The KD-fed mice had similar weight gain as those mice on CD and no overt signs of protein malnutrition (weight loss or reduced plasma total protein), which is in line with findings from studies using KD with similar protein content (~9E%)48, 52. Liver fat content was increased on KD in both genotypes but according to triglyceride measurements this increase did not fulfill the criteria of steatosis (50 mg/g, 57µMol/g triglycerides)53. Our previous study showed a starvation-like condition and high levels amino acids in liver of Bcs1l mice at end-stage disease54. In this study, metabolomics analysis showed similar elevation of plasma amino acids in Bcs1l G/G mice on both diets, which suggests that the probable catabolic state was not exacerbated by KD.",91d36764-7b6b-4b87-8cd8-264225957945
53,discussion13,"  The present study shows that KD may have therapeutic potential in mitochondrial hepatopathies, currently incurable disorders. Further studies in animal models, and eventually in patients, should be designed to elaborate the effect of ketogenic diets on mitochondrial function and inflammatory processes in the context of respiratory chain deficiency.
