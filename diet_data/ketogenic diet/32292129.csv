0,introduction0," Inflammatory bowel disease (Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)) is a complicated chronic inflammatory disease that involves various genetic and environmental driving factors.1 Although its pathogenesis is poorly understood, an increasing number of studies have highlighted that dietary intake plays a key role in disease occurrence due to its underlying effects on gut microbiota, barrier function, and mucosal immunity.2 For instance, a high-salt diet has been shown to exacerbate intestinal inflammation by reducing Lactobacillus abundance and butyrate metabolism,3 while a high-fat diet has been found to contribute toward Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) progression by activating proinflammatory signaling and disrupting barrier systems.4 Although exclusive enteral nutrition has shown clinical promise for promoting Crohn’s disease remission, it remains unclear whether dietary therapy would help to treat ulcerative colitis.",ddb5b537-d8f2-47cb-922a-a69433ed8fd7
1,introduction1,"5 Therefore, the discovery of novel anti-inflammatory dietary strategies is urgently required to manage Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  A ketogenic diet (KD), characterized by high-fat and low-carbohydrate, is a dietary therapy that was initially used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy,6 but has recently gained increasing popularity as a promising therapeutic approach for chronic diseases and human malignancies. In Alzheimer’s disease, a KD not only protects aging nerve cells but also enhances mitochondrial function and downregulates the expression of apoptotic mediators.7 A KD has also been shown to contribute toward reducing diet-induced glycemic responses and thus may represent a favorable adjuvant therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus.8 In addition, a strict KD was found to alter amino acid metabolism in cancer cells, inhibit oncogenic epigenetic modifications, and enhance the efficacy of chemo- and radio-therapies.",aee0f77c-f222-4717-b389-74ab32d13eb8
2,introduction2,"9 A recent review attributed the therapeutic potential of KD to its regulation of gut microbiota and related metabolites, yet emphasized that a KD may also reduce bacterial diversity.10 A newly published work revealed KD-associated gut microbiota decrease the accumulation of intestinal Th17 cells, implying its potential anti-inflammatory role.11 Despite emerging evidences proposing its clinical application in numerous diseases, few studies have investigated whether a KD could be used to alleviate intestinal inflammation or examined its effect on gut microbiota and immune cells in inflammatory microenvironments.  In this study, we compared the gut microbiome and metabolic changes in mice fed with a KD, low-carbohydrate diet (low carbohydrate diet (LCD)), or normal diet (ND). In addition, we investigated the effect of a KD on inflammation, the gut microbiome, mucosal barriers, and immunity using a dextran sulfate sodium (dextran sulfate sodium (DSS))-induced colitis model.",0fa8511d-1dda-470c-a52b-d7156f4bf1fd
3,introduction3," Finally, we clarified the beneficial effects of the KD-modified gut microbiome on intestinal inflammation using fecal microbiota transplantation (fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)) in a germ-free (GF) mouse model. Our findings suggest that KD is a promising dietary therapy for intestinal inflammation and demonstrate its modulatory effect on gut microbiota. ",df8650b8-fc64-42a3-a9f6-26de037c6360
4,methods0," The study design is illustrated in Fig. 1a and consisted of two parts. Firstly, thirty-four 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China, and were divided into three groups: KD (n = 10, KD contains 10% kcal protein, <1% kcal carbohydrate, and 89% kcal fat, FBSH Biotechnology Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China), low carbohydrate diet (LCD) (n = 10, low carbohydrate diet (LCD) contains 20% kcal protein, 10% kcal carbohydrate, and 70% kcal fat, FBSH Biotechnology Co. Ltd), and ND (n = 14, 18% kcal protein, 65% kcal carbohydrate, and 17% kcal fat). Mice were co-housed prior to starting the test diets to control for cage effects.45 Food intake was set at 11.9 kcal/day and decreased to 11.2 kcal/day after weight gain was observed during the first weeks of the study. Cross-sectional mice were always maintained on 11.2 kcal/day.",007b9517-1814-4e6c-8a38-a3651bed7461
5,methods1," A detailed description of diet composition is provided in Supplementary Table 4. After 16 weeks of dietary intervention, the mice were treated with or without 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 1.5 weeks and defined as KD colitis (KD-C, n = 10), low carbohydrate diet (LCD) colitis (low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-C, n = 10), ND colitis (ND-C, n = 10), and ND (n = 4) groups.  Secondly, 34 germ-free C57BL/6J mice were bred at the Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd, China. GF mice received fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using feces from the dietary-treated mice and were treated with a normal diet for 2 weeks before being administered with 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 1 week (normal diet) and divided into four groups: KD + fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) colitis (FKD + C, n = 10), low carbohydrate diet (LCD) + fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) colitis (Flow carbohydrate diet (LCD) + C, n = 10), ND + fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) colitis (FND + C,",35b398f7-fb04-449d-9cdc-7614aa618ca1

8,results0," KD contributes to beneficial gut microbiota and related metabolites in mice before colitis induction  Before inducing colitis, we analyzed the effects of a KD and low carbohydrate diet (LCD) on the fecal microbiota of mice after 16 weeks of dietary intervention (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1b, the Chao1 index was significantly lower in the KD and low carbohydrate diet (LCD) groups than in the ND group; however, no significant differences in the Shannon index were observed between the KD/low carbohydrate diet (LCD) and ND groups (Fig. 1c). Unweighted PCoA analysis indicated a clear distinction between the KD, low carbohydrate diet (LCD), and ND groups (Fig. 1d). At the phylum level (Fig. 1e), the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and relative abundance of Proteobacteria were higher in the KD and low carbohydrate diet (LCD) groups than in the ND group. At the genus level (Fig.",4d0f749e-93a5-456a-baec-4849cd9872b4
9,results1," 1f), Akkermansia and Roseburia were more abundant in the KD group than in the other groups, while Alloprevotella is most abundant in ND. Linear discriminant analysis coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe) revealed that Oscillibacter was enriched in the low carbohydrate diet (LCD) group while Akkermansia, Roseburia, and Ruminococcaceae were enriched in the KD group (Fig. 1g, Supplementary Fig. 1a). The functional potential of gut microbiota was analyzed using PICRUSt and LEfSe (Linear Discriminant Analysis (LEfSe (Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)) score > 3.0, p < 0.05), indicating that bacterial motility proteins and bacterial chemotaxis were over-represented in the microbiome of the low carbohydrate diet (LCD) group compared to the KD and ND groups, while the function “bacterial invasion of epithelial cells” was over-represented in the KD group (Supplementary Fig. 1b).Fig. 1 KD contributes to beneficial gut microbiota and related metabolites in mice before colitis induction.",6c2619d3-8ee6-4e47-b4a7-51d8fea81688

Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plots showed a distinct separation between the metabolites of the three groups (Supplementary Fig. 1c), of which 26 were screened as being significantly different and divided into two clusters based on their concentration profiles, including metabolite clusters dominant in low carbohydrate diet (LCD) (e.g., terephthalic acid, stercobilin) and KD/ND (e.g., l-asparagine, glycolic acid; Fig. 1h).",e704fc0b-c346-4fc4-889b-512fd391b4fc
12,results4," Details of these metabolites are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Straightforward associations between bacteria and metabolites were demonstrated using correlation heatmaps (Fig. 1i), indicating that KD-dominated Akkermansia and ND-dominated Alloprevotella correlated negatively with several low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-dominant metabolites such as terephthalic acid and stercobilin. These results suggest that quantitative induction of ketogenesis relative to ND can effectively alter the gut microbiota and metabolites.  KD controls the body weight gain and changes the metabolic status of mice  As shown in Fig. 2a, low carbohydrate diet (LCD) significantly promoted weight gain in mice before colitis induction whereas no significant weight gain difference was observed between the KD and ND groups, consistent with the Lee index of colitis-induced mice (Fig. 2b).",26302261-46f4-44a7-94b7-60d88bba5177
13,results5," We also measured the weight of fat in the epididymal white adipose tissues of colitis-induced mice, finding that it was significantly higher in the low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-C group than in the KD-C or ND-C groups (Fig. 2c, d). Similar results were observed when comparing the fat vesicles of livers from each group (Fig. 2e, f). Finally, we detected that serum glucose levels were significantly lower in the KD group than in the low carbohydrate diet (LCD) or ND groups (Fig. 2g), whereas serum BOH levels were significantly higher (Fig. 2h). These results demonstrated, low carbohydrate diet (LCD) significantly promoted the body weight, while KD significantly altered the glucose and BOH metabolism of the mice before and after colitis induction.Fig. 2 KD controls the body weight gain and changes the metabolic status of mice. a Body weight of mice fed with a KD, low carbohydrate diet (LCD), or ND for 16 weeks before colitis induction.",f74e67b6-3485-4fe3-9d7f-55e65cceac4b

None of the mice in the KD-C group died during the experiment, whereas four and three mice died in the low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-C and ND-C groups, respectively. In addition, mice in the low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-C group were more likely to have hemafecia and shortened colons than those in the KD-C or ND-C groups, while mice in the KD-C group had less hemafecia and prolonged colons than in the ND-C group (Fig. 3b, c).",a07de124-c92e-4169-bdb3-3dd0122e2a37

Then, Cytoscape software was used to predict the interaction between top 20 genes selected according to their corrected p-values and fold change values (Fig. 4c). Among the gene sets significantly enriched in low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-C, genes associated with cell chemotaxis (Ccl4, Ccl11, IL-1β) and immune/inflammatory response (Tnf, IL-10, IL-1r1, IL-17α) were present and interacted. To validate the transcriptome sequencing, additional mouse inflammatory response and autoimmunity PCR arrays were used to profile the expression of 84 key genes involved in inflammatory response affected by KD or low carbohydrate diet (LCD) (n = 4 per group). The data showed up-regulation of 15 candidate genes in the low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-C vs. KD-C groups (Fig. 4d).",493e2b5d-d0e5-467a-83a4-79970c6d58dc

Notably, IL-22 may directly regulate barrier function or indirectly exert this role through producing IL-18.12 Thus, PCR assays validated that colon tissues from the KD-C and low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-C groups displayed lower and higher IL-22, IL-17α, IL-18, and Ccl4 expression than the ND-C group, respectively (Fig. 4f). Furthermore, immunofluorescence indicated that colon epithelium from the low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-C and ND-C groups was enriched with more RORγt+CD3− ILC3 cells than the KD-C group, most of which were concentrated in cryptopatches.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that colon tissues from the FKD-C group displayed significantly lower IL-17α, IL-18, IL-22, and Ccl4 mRNA levels than the FND-C group, whereas the opposite was observed for the Flow carbohydrate diet (LCD)-C group (Fig. 7d). Fecal microbiota profiles confirmed significant differences between the genera present in the microbiota of all three recipient groups, including those affected by the KD (Akkermansia), low carbohydrate diet (LCD) (Oscillibacter), and ND (Alloprevotella and Lactobacillus) that were still dominant in the FKD, Flow carbohydrate diet (LCD), and FND groups, respectively (Fig. 7e).",e0ab5cd3-350a-4e84-b26e-bbffa16b5a21
33,results25," Detailed analysis revealed that the OTUs successfully transferred from ND microbiota accounted for 98.0% of the donor’s entire community, while those from KD and low carbohydrate diet (LCD) microbiota accounted for 92% and 93%, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). Of the 80 most abundant OTUs in each microbiota type (88% of ND microbiota, 94% of KD microbiota, 93% of low carbohydrate diet (LCD) microbiota), we verified that 68 KD OTUs and 72 low carbohydrate diet (LCD) OTUs were detected in the recipient mice, whereas 78 ND OTUs were present (Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table 3). These results demonstrate that a significant proportion of OTUs successfully colonized the gut of recipient mice, validating the reliability of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).Fig. 7 Effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from KD- and low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-fed mice on mucosal inflammation and immunity in colitis-induced germ-free mice.",4d647e16-4a63-487e-b1b3-c87c70a91989

36,discussion0," In this study, we found that the KD and low carbohydrate diet (LCD) changed the specific composition and function of gut microbiota and metabolites. After colitis induction, the KD significantly reduced inflammatory responses, protected intestinal barrier function, and reduced ILC3 production and the expression of related inflammatory cytokines, whereas the opposite effects were observed for the low carbohydrate diet (LCD). In addition, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) revealed that the inhibitory effect of the KD in colitis was dependent on its modification of gut microbiota. Altogether, these findings highlight that KD could represent a promising dietary therapeutic strategy for treating Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Fig. 7f).  In this study, mice fed with a KD for 16 weeks following a quantitative feeding strategy appeared to display similar weight gain to the control group.",bb36e293-51a8-47b1-b8b8-111269818731
37,discussion1," This observation is consistent with a recent study demonstrating that a KD increases lifespan in adult mice and preserves physiological function in aged mice.13 We also investigated the effect of diet on gut microbiota and found that the KD dramatically increased the abundance of Akkermansia and butyric acid-producing Roseburia. Consistently, a recent study showed that a KD modulates host metabolism to prevent seizures by increasing the abundance of Akkermansia,14 while previous studies have associated several Akkermansia species with improved glucose homeostasis, modulating immune responses, and protecting barrier function.15–17 Roseburia is a “lean bacteria” associated with weight loss and improved glucose tolerance;18 therefore, the increased abundance of Akkermansia and Roseburia may be, at least in part, indirectly responsible for weight control and maintaining healthy gut physiology.",4766babf-154b-4409-a198-f826462873d3
38,discussion2," The low carbohydrate diet (LCD) mainly increased the relative abundance of Oscillibacter, a typical inflammation-related bacteria that is enriched in high-fat diets and is related to the increased susceptibility of progeny to colitis.19 The low carbohydrate diet (LCD) critically altered microbiome functional profiles such as activated bacterial motility and LPS biosynthesis pathways, which are common in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) animal models and accompanied by changes in intestinal barrier function.20,21 Over-represented bacterial invasion of epithelial cells function in KD suggests a more intensified direct interaction between bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells.  In general, our global nontargeted metabolomics analysis of fecal samples from the KD, low carbohydrate diet (LCD), and ND groups yielded unique and differential metabolic signatures. The feces of mice fed with a KD displayed increased levels of metabolites such as l-asparagine, glycolic acid, and glycine.",eb8c2796-46d6-49ef-8feb-fde46a071f50
39,discussion3," Interestingly, l-asparagine exerts anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory effects in animals fed with a high-fat diet and meanwhile protects the intestinal barrier and reduces the damage caused by LPS.22,23 In addition, glycolic acid can act as a lipase inhibitor in the intestine to promote weight loss.24 Glycine is a constituent amino acid of the endogenous antioxidant that reduces glutathione and its supplementation can improve gut microbiota and exert anti-obesity effects.25,26 In contrast, terephthalic acid, saccharopine, stercobilin and N-acetylaspartic acid were the major metabolites in the feces of low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-fed mice. In particular, terephthalic acid levels were ~17 times higher than in the KD-fed mice and has previously been associated with mucosal toxicity.",2210906b-7a46-4408-8c32-6174e3b4e070
40,discussion4,"27 Saccharopine (a type of mitochondrial toxin) and stecobilin have both been shown to damage cells and induce DNA-damage,28,29 while a recent study demonstrated that N-acetylaspartic acid can promote oxidative stress, damage antioxidant enzymes, and promote inflammation via multiple pathways, such as TNFα, iNOS, COX2, and ICAM3.30 Taken together, the increased levels of these metabolites in KD- and low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-fed mice may partly explain weight change and inflammation inhibition/promotion.  To investigate the effect of the KD and low carbohydrate diet (LCD) on intestinal barrier function and gut microbiota in inflammatory microenvironment, we used dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce experimental colitis. The low carbohydrate diet (LCD) exacerbated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and induced colonic barrier disruption, whereas the KD caused the opposite effect.",11837374-790b-44bd-8a69-acc5a25881e7
41,discussion5," The low carbohydrate diet (LCD) significantly downregulated Occludin and ZO-1, two components of tight junctions, and Muc2, a protein secreted by goblet cells that is essential for the structure of the mucus layer in the intestine.31 Although many studies have reported that high-fat diets can impair intestinal barrier function, we know very little about the effect of a KD on the intestinal barrier.32 To explain the differences in colitis caused by the two diets, we tested gut microbiota after dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment, finding that Escherichia/Shigella was the dominant genus in low carbohydrate diet (LCD)-treated colitis, while KD-treated mice were dominated by Akkermansia. Moreover, we detected bacteria similar in composition and diversity in the MLN to those detected in stools.",716bd6bd-8e3c-46d0-a545-2eed027e699f
42,discussion6," Akkermansia exerts vital inflammatory protective roles and the predominance of Proteobacteria, specifically adherent-invasive Escherichia coli strains in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), has been known for many years;33 however, it remains unclear whether this reflects a true driver of disease or just a change in the gut. Since both processes are likely, the diversity of disease course and presentation may represent different levels of microbial involvement in different individuals.34  Colitis occurrence involves changes in many genes related to immune cell trafficking, cell viability, and signal transduction.35,36 Surprisingly, we found that the low carbohydrate diet (LCD) upregulated the expression of multiple chemokines and cytokines, and increased the number of ILC3 cells in the colonic lamina propria; however, the KD had the opposite effect. Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that can promote leukocyte migration to areas of inflammation and initiate immune cell activation.",e7bd596b-7f11-42b7-9b1e-d9c1980a8b29
43,discussion7,"37 The KD also reduced the expression of Ccl4, which has been associated with Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).38 It has been reported that human colonic chemokine expression is non-selectively upregulated in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and that the degree of local inflammation and tissue damage is dependent on the local expression of specific chemokines in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) tissues.38 Proinflammatory Ccl12 has been suggested as a target for treating intestinal inflammation in mice with experimental colitis,39 while IL-22 is highly upregulated in inflamed intestinal mucosa and sera from patients with Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).40  In this study, we also found KD could reduce the ILC3 cell production in the inflamed colonic epithelium and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) indicated this effect was associated with KD-modified gut microbiota.",ef2e618f-b08a-4879-ae8f-af9a74bdcd2f
44,discussion8," ILC3s, developing from common lymphoid progenitor cells, have recently been proved to participate in not only maintaining gastrointestinal mucosal homeostasis but also contributing to Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) progression.41 The previous mechanism investigation revealed that ILC3 cells promote IL-17a, IL-22, and IL-18 production to aggravate Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development through damaging intestinal mucosa barrier, which directly caters to our array results showing their levels were reduced in intestinal tissues of KD-treated mice.12 In addition, a newly published study has suggested microbial composition serves as a crucial factor affecting ILC3 cells during infectious or inflammatory diseases.42 Therefore, we speculated KD-modified gut microbiota exerted its anti-inflammatory effect partly through reducing ILC3 cell production.",a0cd42fc-1cb1-4dd3-b5ff-cf0c1397c435
45,discussion9," Future investigations are needed to clarify which KD-related bacteria species were dominantly responsible for ILC3 cell production in the inflammatory microenvironment.  There are some limitations to this study. Firstly, we found KD alleviated the progression of intestinal inflammation but meanwhile reduced the abundance of some healthy bacteria such as Lactobacillus as compared with ND. On the one hand, we explain this finding to the fact that intestinal inflammation is affected by the global changes of gut microbiota rather than one or several bacteria. On the other hand, future work is still needed to confirm the dominant bacteria responsible for the beneficial role of KD based on more accurate detecting techniques such as metagenomics. Secondly, we observed KD could also induce liver lipid accumulation in colitis mice, which is in accordance with a recent study showing similar effects in type 2 diabetic mice.",97ec0df1-576a-4368-a3f7-2ec97ba4ee46
46,discussion10,"43 This finding implies a potential health risk of long-term KD but another recent study has advocated high-intensity interval training (high intensity interval training (HIIT)) may be helpful in preventing KD-induced adverse events.44 Therefore, whether high intensity interval training (HIIT) could mitigate the liver lipid accumulation in KD-treated colitis mice will be investigated in our following work. Thirdly, we noted bacterial invasion of epithelial cells was over-represented in biological functions of gut microbiota from KD group, suggesting the interaction of KD-dominated bacteria with epithelial cells. In future, we will focus on some selected KD-dominated bacteria and try to clarify the impact of their interaction with epithelial cells on intestinal homeostasis and intestinal diseases. Lastly, our study was entirely based on murine models and the actual role of KD on human beings especially for those with or at risk of colitis remains unknown.",4a3fb6ed-9ab8-40a8-9366-06c63312f41a
47,discussion11," This limitation is expected to be solved by well-designed clinical trials with ethical approve in future.  In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from donors with a KD confers microbiota benefits and relieves colitis in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced recipients. We found that diets play an important role in shaping gut microbiota and that a KD can produce ideal gut microbiota for promoting weight control and resisting inflammation. Although this study is based on murine models and clinical effects have not yet been verified in human trials, we believe that our results provide new avenues for dietary Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapies and inform the customization and design of bacterial consortia for microbiota-targeted dietary supplements in patients with Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to prevent intestinal barrier deterioration.
