0,methods0," Literature Search and Reporting  For relevant randomised clinal trials and other primary studies, searches were conducted on five electronic databases, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. In addition, the reference lists of identified studies were also scoured for additional studies. All the searches were conducted per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta analyses (PRISMA)) guidelines and priori protocol from the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (protocol from the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)). Key search terms and the Boolean operators “AND” and “OR” were used for an effective literature search. The search strategy was as follows; (low carbohydrate OR low-carb) AND (ketogenic OR very low carbohydrate) AND (glycemic OR glucose OR HBA1c) AND (weight OR BMI OR body mass index) AND (type 2 diabetes OR T2DM).",f8b217b2-dbe5-4dc7-8815-e6ad81373823
1,methods1," The search query was conducted from 2000 to 2022.  Eligibility Criteria  Two reviewers were tasked with screening all the articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. For studies to be included in this review, they had to meet the following inclusion criteria: studies written and published in English, studies that compared either low-carb diets or KDs to other diets in patients with type 2 diabetes, studies conducted only on human beings, and studies with ten or more patients. The exclusion criteria were outlined below: studies conducted on animal species and studies published in other languages. This consideration was made to avoid translation of scientific works which could lose meaning or context, studies that compared other dietary therapies other than low-carb and KDs, and studies that evaluated the dietary therapies on patients other than type 2 diabetes patients (e.g., type 1 diabetes patients, obesity, etc.",57a06f0c-7fa1-481f-a028-ed4e8131be96

Data retrieved from these studies included author ID (names and year of publishment), study type, population (sample size, age, and sex), intervention, control intervention, and main results. The main outcomes for this systematic review and meta-analysis included HBA1c used as a measure for glycemic control and BMI and body weight (BW) used as measures for weight control. Any discrepancies in the data extraction process were reconciled by consulting a third reviewer.  Quality Assessment  A quality assessment was conducted on all included studies based on the specific criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. A ReviewManager (RevMan 5.4.1, Cochrane, Alberta, Canada) software was utilised to accomplish a quality assessment of included studies.",229f9c75-c151-4e4e-ae64-3a21f481f429
3,methods3," The quality of each study was categorised into; “low risk,” “high risk,” and “unclear risk” by considering the elements of selection, performance, attrition, and reporting bias. A study with sufficient and relevant results was considered “good” and was said to have a low risk of bias. Conversely, a study with insufficient reporting was reported to have a high risk of bias. On the other hand, a lack of clear judgment from the reviewers resulted in considering a study to be of unclear risk. Below is Figure 1, which shows the risk of bias graph and Figure 2, which shows the risk of bias summary; both figures summarise the quality assessment of articles included in this review.   Figure 1 Risk of bias graph.  Figure 2 Risk of bias summary.  Data Analysis  ReviewManager (RevMan 5.4.1) software was used to conduct a meta-analysis on all the outcome measures.

27,discussion3," The pooled results from our meta-analysis have shown that no significant difference in BMI values was observed between KDs and control diets (standardised mean difference (SMD): -0.31 kg/m2; 95% CI; -0.81 kg/m2, 0.20 kg/m2; P < 0.00001, I2 = 84%). These results are consistent with those of a previous meta-analysis that reported KD reduced BMI values; however, the difference was not statistical (standardised mean difference (SMD): -0.63kg/m2; 95% CI; -1.31kg/m2, 0.08kg/m2; P < 0.00001, I2 = 87%) [26]. However, results from the included studies showed some variations. Li S et al. [19] reported that after 12-week consumption of KDs, a significant difference in BMI values was observed compared with those subjected to a diabetic diet (26.21 ± 5.74 vs 29.42 ± 5.97, respectively). This significant difference in the BMI was attributed to the fact that the KD stimulated different degrees of starvation and the ketone body became a vital way for energy supply throughout the body.",1c0bdb86-4915-469a-934c-a6bac381d6cb
28,discussion4,"  The pooled results of the meta-analysis affirm our hypothesis that a KD significantly improves HbA1c, which is a glycemic measure. The results show that the HbA1c percentage was reduced by 1.45% after KD consumption. This increased reduction in the HbA1c levels can be attributed to the increased weight loss observed after the consumption of KDs. The results of our meta-analysis are supported by a previous meta-analysis of four RCTs that reported a significant reduction of 1.02% in HbA1c observed in patients that consumed KDs compared to those subjected to other diets [27]. Despite HbA1c levels being used as the measure for glycemic control, fasting glucose is also an important measure to assess the effect of a KD on glycemic control. A randomised study of 53 T2DM patients reported that a significant reduction in fasting glucose was observed in patients subjected to a KD (from 9.01±2.77 to 7.62±1.69 mmol/L) compared to those subjected to a diabetic diet (from 8.98±2.48 to 8.42±2.",7a459afc-91bf-4c62-b0cb-6284086192c8
29,discussion5,"17 mmol/L). These results are in accordance with the results from a previous study conducted by Myette-Côté É et al. They reported that a KD significantly and rapidly improved the patients’ blood glucose control by lowering the fasting insulin, stabilising blood glucose, and alleviating the fluctuations in blood glucose among patients with T2DM [28]. Similarly, 45 patients with T2DM who consumed very-low-calorie KD showed a significant decrease in fasting glucose (from 136.9 (34.4) to 108.9 (20.4) mg/dL) compared to those who consumed a low-calorie diet (low calorie diet (LCD)) (from 140.5 (43.1) to 123.3 (24.3) mg/dL) [22].  On the other hand, the results of this systematic review have shown that patients that consumed low-carbohydrate diets had a weight loss of 0.33 kg; however, when compared with the control diets, this difference was not statistically significant. These results are similar to the review conducted by Kirk et al.",d3ece383-dcbe-40a1-803c-a1fb280e659a
30,discussion6," [29], who reported no significant difference in weight loss after consuming low-carbohydrate diets compared with other diets. Similarly, another meta-analysis reported that the difference in weight loss between low-carbohydrates and control diets was not statistically significant (weighted mean difference (was not statistically significant (weighted mean difference (WMD)): 20.69 kg; 95% CI: 21.77, 0.39 kg; P = 0.21) [7]. A previous systematic review and meta-analysis of seven RCTs reported that low-to-moderate carbohydrates and high-carbohydrate diets had the same effect on BW after short- and long-term intervention [29]. Some of the included studies have reported that low-carbohydrate diets significantly impact weight loss compared to other diets. A randomised study conducted on 22 patients reported that after a six-month intervention, patients subjected to a low-carbohydrate diet had a significant decrease in BW (from 67.0 ± 15.9 to 64.4 ± 14.",c34966b0-3b85-4899-8e8f-6c58ed269f69
31,discussion7,"2 kg) compared to those subjected to a calorie-restricted diet (from 68.1 ± 7.7 to 66.7 ± 7.0). Other studies have shown that low-carbohydrate diets had an inferior weight loss compared to other diets. For example, a study by Guldbrand H et al. reported that after 12 months of intervention, low fat diet (LFD) had a more significant weight loss (from 98.8 ± 21 to 95.9 ± 21 kg) compared to low calorie diet (LCD) (from 91.4 ± 19 to 89.4 ± 22). However, the study also reports that the short-term (six months) weight loss was not statistically different in either group (-4.0 ± 4.1 kg and -4.3 ± 3.6 kg, for low fat diet (LFD) and low calorie diet (LCD) groups, respectively). No significant difference was observed in BMI values when a low-carbohydrate diet was compared to other diets. The results show that a low-carbohydrate diet lowered BMI by 0.26 kg/m2, which can be considered statistically significant.",c15bcd22-cbcf-434c-96ee-e6198d71e32b
32,discussion8," These results are supported by a previous systematic review that reported a statistical difference in BMI values for patients subjected to a low-carbohydrate diet and a high-carbohydrate diet [29]. The low-carbohydrate diet also reduced HbA1c by 0.27%; however, this difference can be considered not statistically significant. Similarly, results reported in a previous systematic review by Sainsbury E et al. [9] showed that low carbohydrates significantly reduced HbA1c levels compared to patients subjected to high carbohydrates (was not statistically significant (weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.36%, 95% CI: -0.62, -0.09). Similarly, a previous study reported a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c for patients in the low-carbohydrate group than in the calorie-restricted diet (-0.65% vs 0.0%) [30].",a2468a4a-63ec-435a-9b47-db9585212f16
33,discussion9," Another systematic review reported that after six months, a greater reduction in HbA1c levels was observed in diabetic patients receiving a low-carbohydrate diet compared with those in the healthy eating group (-0.4% vs -0.2%) [31].  Limitations of the study  The primary limitation of this systematic review and meta-analysis is that high heterogeneity was observed, especially in studies comparing KDs to other control diets. In some cases, the extent of heterogeneity grew to 96%. This high heterogeneity is not uncommon and may be attributed to the fact that the control diets differed in each included study, and also, some studies had uneven sample sizes. The heterogeneity should be considered when interpreting the results; however, in this systematic review, the heterogeneity of the included studies had no influence on clinical decision-making since the superiority of both low-carbohydrate and KDs compared with the control diets was well established.",ed174999-d2be-403b-a769-c2c29111cf49
34,discussion10," The study also included studies that independently compared ketogenic or low-carbohydrate diets to other diets due to the lack of studies that directly compare ketogenic to low-carbohydrate diets among patients with T2DM. This may result in biased results since the control diets differed in each included study. The study also included studies published only in English, which may lead to the omission of important information that may have been retrieved from the studies published in other languages.  Conclusions  This systematic review suggests that both ketogenic and low-carbohydrate diets produce significant differences in HbA1c levels, which is a measure of glycemic control. However, comparing the effects of ketogenic and low-carbohydrate diets on glycemic control, it is evident that KDs had a significant reduction in HbA1c values compared to low-carbohydrate diets.",11caaacc-b1fc-4c60-8fea-409478104be1
35,discussion11," This difference can be attributed to the fact that glycemic control mostly depends on the degree of carbohydrate restrictions. The results also show that a significant weight loss is observed in patients subjected to KDs compared to those subjected to low-carbohydrate diets. This increased weight loss observed in T2DM patients subjected to a KD can be associated with a significant decrease in HbA1c. No significant difference in BMI values was observed in either ketogenic or low-carbohydrate diets. These results show that the KD can be considered an effective dietary therapy for patients with T2DM. However, for patients with T2DM, it is necessary to balance the potential increase in cardiovascular risk, which results from an unfavourable blood lipid profile observed with a KD derived from the weight loss and improved glycemic control.  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. =",8cac59ef-7cb8-49bd-b358-76fc2aaf2549
