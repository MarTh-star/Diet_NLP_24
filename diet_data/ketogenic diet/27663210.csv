0,methods0,"A total of 18 (four week-old) male CD-1 mice (Charles River, Calco, Italy) were used in this study. They were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility under a controlled environment with ad libitum access to water and food. Mice were randomly assigned to two distinct treatment groups. Of these mice, nine were fed the ND. Nine mice, instead, received the KD for two weeks (Teklad TD.96355, Harlan Italy) before being subjected to the 6-Hz corneal stimulation test (Figure 7). The KD was also administered during the testing period and consisted of (g%, w/w) 67.43 fats, 15.08 proteins, and 0.54 carbohydrates, resulting in a fats-to-proteins+carbohydrates ratio of 4.3:1. The caloric density of the KD was 6.69 kcal g−1 (fats: 90.66%; proteins: 9.01%; carbohydrates: 0.32%). Mice were weighed once a week to monitor body growth.  For electrode implantation, mice were anesthetized with ketamine + xylazine (150 + 10 µg/g).",2843f5e9-9ae1-4198-adcf-ba7f472845d5
1,methods1," Guiding holes were drilled and epidural electrodes (stainless steel Ø = 1 mm; PlasticsOne, Roanoke, VA, USA) were implanted in the frontal (bregma 0 mm, 3 mm lateral from midline) and occipital cortices (bregma −3.5 mm, 3 mm lateral from midline) of the right hemisphere [25,26,27]. One electrode was implanted below lambda on the midline and used as reference. At the end of the surgery, gel containing 2.5 g lidocaine chloride, 0.5 g neomycin sulfate and 0.025 g fluocinolone acetonide (Neuflan® gel; Molteni Farmaceutici, Florence, FI, Italy) was applied to reduce pain and the risk of infection.  Mice were placed in cages without a cover to allow a cable to connect the headset and preamplifiers. Electrical brain activity was filtered (0.",9ad88c52-f925-47d9-ad51-067e1fc40021
2,methods2,"3 Hz high-pass, 500 Hz low-pass), acquired at 1 kHz per channel, and stored on a personal computer as the mathematical subtraction of traces of recording electrodes minus traces of reference electrode (only for epidural electrodes), using a PowerLab8/30 amplifier connected to four BioAmp preamplifiers (ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). Videos were digitally captured by a camera connected to the computer and synchronized to the ECoG traces by LabChart 7 Pro internal trigger.  Mice were stimulated once and let to recover for three days before being stimulated for a second time. Corneal stimulation was as previously described [25,26,27]. Briefly, ocular anesthetic (0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride eye drops, Novesin, Laboratoires Théa, 63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France) was applied 10 min before stimulation. Stimulation (fixed current intensity of 32 mA, pulse width of 0.",db9b26e7-21cb-45cb-b3da-c90ceb0c0915
3,methods3,"2 msec, duration of 3 sec, frequency of 6 Hz) was delivered via external non-invasive corneal electrodes connected to a stimulator (ECT Unit 5780; Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy), as shown by Castel-Branco et al. [36].  All experiments were in compliance with the European Directive 2010/63/EU and carried out according to the national guidelines on animal experimental research of the Italian Ministry of Health (DM 92/2013). The University of Modena and Reggio Emilia Ethics Committee approved the study protocol. All efforts were made to refine procedures to improve the welfare and to reduce the number of animals that were used.  ECoG traces were offline digitally filtered (band-pass: high 50 Hz, low 1 Hz) and manually analyzed using LabChart 7 Pro software v7.3.8 (ADInstruments) by blind to treatment expert raters. Seizures were characterized by epileptiform ECoG patterns occurring right after the stimulus artifact.",4b6eb652-a04b-4cb3-b384-9fa93886c69f
4,methods4," ECoG patterns characterized by trains of 150–250 ms long spikes with amplitudes at least twice as the previous 2 sec baseline were considered as electrographic seizures.  Patients with drug-resistant seizures admitted to the pediatric neurology service between April 2011 and February 2017 and treated with the KD were retrospectively examined. These patients were treated with the KD due to (i) a failure of drug treatment with two or more appropriately chosen AEDs; (ii) good compliance with AED administration; (iii) lack of alterations of serum amino acids, urine organic acids, acylcarnitine, lactate, pyruvate, and ammonia blood levels. They received the nutritional treatment by starting with a 2:1 ratio of lipids and proteins + carbohydrates and, after few days, shifting to a 3.5/4:1 ratio [37]. Routine laboratory and encephalographic investigations were fully available for at least 1–3 months of treatment. Blood levels of AEDs were also recorded.",7cd2c74b-02eb-4064-ac7e-ad8ca651fafa
5,methods5," The final study was conducted on a cohort of 21 subjects with ages ranging from 3 to 15 years. Data about demographic features, clinical characteristics, diagnostic findings, therapeutic interventions, and clinical outcomes are reported in Table 1.  The ketone body β-hydroxybutyric acid was measured in fasting blood samples obtained by isoflurane anesthetized mice, one day after the testing procedure. Precisely, trunk blood was collected after decapitation of deeply anesthetized mice. One drop of blood was adsorbed on a test strip and read with the Precision Xtra Blood Ketone Meter (Abbott Diabetes Care, Rome, Italy). In patients, fasting glucose and ketone basal values were noted during hospitalization; after that, parents reported glycaemia and β-hydroxybutyric acid levels three times/day/week up to 15 weeks.  β-hydroxybutyric acid levels were compared by Student’s t test. Linear regression analysis was applied to investigate the relationship between ketosis and seizure reduction.",e7242e85-dd6b-444b-9590-5b1581dc1a07
6,methods6," Fisher’s exact test was used to compare mice that developed seizures with loss of posture with those that maintained posture control, in the two different groups of treatment. Seizure duration and electrographic recordings were compared using two-way analysis of variance, considering the different diet as the between factor and the session of 6-Hz corneal stimulation as the within factor. The Holm–Šídák test was used for multiple comparisons. All statistical analyses were carried out using Sigmaplot 11 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA). Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (standard error of the mean (SEM)) and were regarded significantly different at p < 0.05. ",6afc2ca2-519f-4dae-aa00-7177a2d8ec43
