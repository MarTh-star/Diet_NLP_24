Elacridar was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (United Kingdom), dissolved in DMSO at 0.5 mM, and stored at -20 °C to be used at 0.5 µM in RH-human serum albumin (HSA) 0.1% buffer.  4.2. The Human in Vitro BBB Model The human brain-like endothelial cells (BLECs) from the in vitro BBB model were from the co-culture of endothelial cells (ECs) derived from CD34+ cord blood hematopoietic stem cells with brain pericytes as previously described by Cecchelli et al. (2014) [38].",429afbec-fe04-4d26-b349-d615fa4dd9b7
2,methods2," Donors’ parents, in accordance with French legislation, gave their consent for the collection of human umbilical cord blood. The French Ministry of Higher Education and Research (CODECOH DC2011-1321) approved the collection of human cells. According to the method described by Pedroso et al. (2011) [86], CD34+ stem cells were isolated from human umbilical cord blood and then prompted to differentiate into ECs. For the differentiation step, isolated CD34+ were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium-2 (EGM-2; Lonza) supplemented with 20% (v/v) FCS (Life Technologies) and 50 ng·mL−1 of vascular endothelial growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) (PrepoTech Inc), on 0.2% gelatin-coated 24-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well). After 15–20 days of differentiation, ECs were amplified in the culture dish at P2 and frozen in frozen medium (10% DMSO, 50% FCS, ECM-5).",1dc9cfe1-99cb-4297-b65e-c24e7c6843db
3,methods3," Then, ECs were thawed and seeded onto Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)-coated filters (Costar Transwell inserts, Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA, pore size 0.4 µm, 8 × 104 cells/insert), and co-cultured with bovine brain pericytes isolated as described by Vandenhaute et al. (2011) [87] in a 12-well plate with ECM-5. The culture medium was changed every two days. These culture conditions were maintained for 5 days and enabled the CD34+-ECs to acquire a BBB phenotype (i.e., BLECs). Under these conditions, the model was ready for experiments and stable for 21 days. A mycoplasma detection (Lonza, Rockland, ME, USA) was performed to validate the absence of mycoplasma in the cell culture medium.  The co-culture model delimits two compartments, the apical compartment that mimics the blood side and the basolateral compartment that mimics the brain side. The BBB model was described in Cecchelli et al. (2014) [38].  4.3.",c850a26d-8491-41a2-b6d5-0a80e1e66921
4,methods4," Treatment with KBs After 5 days of co-culture, AcAc and/or βHB were added to the apical compartment (blood side) for 48 h at 37 °C. The concentrations used (5, 10, 15, and 20 mM AcAc or βHB or both in ratio 20 mM AcAc/20 mM βHB) were selected according to the KB levels measured during a normal diet (basal serum level < 0.3 mM), a ketogenic diet or starvation (5–8 mM), and diabetic ketoacidosis (> 25 mM) [58,88]. Since blood AcAc and βHB are normally present in the blood during fasting or starvation at a 1:1 ratio, we also treated cells with 20 mM AcAc/20 mM βHB [89]. The pH of the cell culture medium with or without KBs was measured during experimental conditions (48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2) using a pH meter (WTW inolab pH level 1). In these conditions, the pH of the cell culture media was monitored before (~7.3) and after (~6.9) KB treatments. No significant pH variation was observed after KB treatment compared to the control.  4.4.",c1c5ce9f-e1bb-4ab6-9f1b-a68172842f10
5,methods5," Cell Viability Assay Cell viability was determined using the standard MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay (AR1156, Boster Biological Technology, Pleasanton, CA, USA). For each condition tested, cells were seeded in triplicate and incubated during 48 h in the absence or in the presence of different concentrations of KBs (5, 10, 15, 20 mM of each, or in ratio 20 mM AcAc/20 mM βHB) once the BBB phenotype was established. Following treatments, 150 000 BLECs/insert were counted for each condition. MTT was added to the apical compartment for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and the purple formazan crystals from MTT were then dissolved with DMSO (300 µL/well). The optical density (OD) was measured at a wavelength of 570 and 630 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek. Colmar, France).",3bdcc875-d437-4d20-968e-aaaecb216cc5
6,methods6," The % relative cell viability compared to the control condition was calculated using the following formula: % relative cell viability = ((OD570 - OD630) condition)/((OD570–OD630) control) × 100.  4.5. Measurement of glucose and βHB levels in culture medium After 5 days of co-culture, 20 mM AcAc or 20 mM βHB or 20 mM AcAc/20mM βHB (ratio treatment) was added to the apical compartment for 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. During this time, the glucose and βHB concentrations were measured in both the apical compartment and the basolateral compartment. The Precision-Xtra meter (Abbott Labs, Abbott Park, IL, USA) with a glucose or β-ketone sticks was used. In these assays, the glucose and βHB concentrations measured by the sticks were representative of the glucose and βHB present in the culture medium. Data were expressed in mmol·L−1 for βHB and in g·L−1 for glucose. The βHB concentration within BLECs was measured at 48 h following the treatment.",e1a01342-8645-42e1-874c-3cc46191ce06
7,methods7," Briefly, after medium removal, BLECs were washed twice with RH buffer and lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (Millipore Corporation, Burlington, MA, USA). The βHB concentration in the BLECs was normalized by the protein amount using Bradford assay (Bio-rad, Munich, Germany). The amount of βHB into the supernatant was assayed using β-ketone sticks, as described above. The βHB concentration was verified in the culture medium without cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to ensure the stability of βHB.  4.6. Evaluation of BLEC Monolayer Permeability The integrity of the BLEC monolayer after 48 h of treatment with KBs was evaluated using the method described by Dehouck et al. (1992) [90]. Each coculture condition was performed in triplicate. The fluorescent integrity marker LY was used at a final concentration of 50 µM in RH buffer to obtain the endothelial permeability coefficient (Pe) from the apical-to-basolateral compartment.",34f9f166-9b34-4b63-a500-db9b4375c4c4
8,methods8," The fluorescence of LY in each compartment was measured using the excitation/emission wavelength (432/538 nm) using a microplate reader (Synergy H1). In this calculation method, both the filter without cell permeability (PSf = insert filter + matrigel coating) and filter plus cell permeability (PSt = insert filter + matrigel coating + ECs) were taken into account, according to the formula: 1/PSe = 1/PSt + 1/PSf, where PS is the permeability x surface area product (in microliters per minute) obtained by dividing the volume cleared from the donor to the receiver compartment (in µL) for 1 h. Themass balance (%) was calculated from the amount of compound recovered in the donor and receiver compartment at the end of the experiment divided by the total amount added in the donor compartment at time zero. To be taken into account for Pe determination, the mass balance should be between 80% and 120%.  4.7.",7a0ad967-a484-4da3-8999-e86aa1809298
9,methods9," Immunostaining After 48 h of treatments with or without KBs, BLECs were fixed and permeabilized as described in Table 1. Then, a 30-min blocking with PBS-CMF (0.2 g·L−1 KH2PO4 , 8.0 g·L−1 NaCl, 2.87 g·L−1 Na2HPO4-12H2O, and 0.2 g·L−1 KCl) with 10% (v/v) normal goat serum (normal goat serum (NGS)) was performed. Then, cells were incubated for 60 min with the primary antibody in PBS-CMF supplemented with 2% normal goat serum (NGS) at room temperature (RT), against the target protein as described in Table 1.  After three washes in PBS-CMF supplemented with 2% normal goat serum (NGS), the cells were incubated with secondary polyclonal antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 568, A11036, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) diluted 1:500 in PBS-CMF supplemented with 2% normal goat serum (NGS) in the dark for 30 min at RT. Hoechst 33358 was used for nuclei staining. After mounting with Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1,4-diazabicyclo [2.2.",321054d5-3a5a-48f3-a16f-db5260e2adf3
10,methods10,"2]octane (Sigma-Aldrich), images were taken using a Leica microscope (DMRD; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and processed using ImageJ32 software.  4.8. Protein Extraction and Immunoblots After 48 h of treatment, BLECs were washed twice with cold RH buffer and scraped with 50 µL UT4 lysis buffer (7M Urea, 2M Thiourea, 4% CHAPS) or 50µL RIPA 1X lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 140 mM NaCl) (Merck Millipore, USA) supplemented with a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (1% protease inhibitors cocktail P8340; 1% phosphatase inhibitors cocktail 1 P2850; 1% phosphatase inhibitors cocktail 2 P5726). Lysates were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was saved and sonicated three times at 40 W for 5 s. The lysate protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method.",6368e49f-7145-45d0-a04c-36db45c974c3
11,methods11," Then, 30 µg of total protein for LRP1 or 20 µg for the other proteins were mixed with Laemmli (Bio-rad, Munich, Germany) supplemented with beta-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Details of the denaturation and reduction step of the protein extract are described in Table 2.  Then, the protein mixes were electrophoresed using Criterion™ TGX™ (Tris-Glycine eXtended) precast gels (Bio-rad) and subsequently electrotransferred to nitro cellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Germany). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the membrane with Tris-buffered saline 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST; 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1%Tween 20) supplemented with 5% skimmed milk at RT for 1 h under agitation. Membranes were incubated in the appropriate primary antibodies (Table 2) and incubated at 4 °C overnight, excepted for P-gp (2 h at RT) and β-actin (20 min at RT).",93eebace-2451-4f15-bb58-409bd023ecac
12,methods12," Then, membranes were washed with TBST three times for 5 min each, and then incubated with the horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody anti-mouse (1:3000, Dako/Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA,) or secondary antibody anti-rabbit (1:8000, Dako/Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) for 1 h at RT. Then, membranes were washed with TBST three times for 5 min each and bands of immunoreactive protein were visualized after membrane incubation with enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) reagent and revealed by the Western blot Imaging system Azure c600 (Azure Biosystems, Dublin, Ireland). Quantification of the relative densities of bands was performed with TotalLab TL 100 1D Gel Analysis software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK). The protein expression normalization was conducted with anti-β-actin. Studies were performed at least three independents experiments, with two Western blots per experiment.  4.9.",b7f460dc-23f9-488b-94ea-9462f31935ed
13,methods13," Amyloid-β (1-40) Peptide Transport Studies Forty-eight hours after KB treatments, the apical-to-basolateral and the basolateral-to-apical transport of Aβ1-40 across BLECs was investigated as previously described [13,44,46] (Briefly, for apical-to-basolateral studies, filters were transferred to new 12-well plates containing 1.5 mL of RH-human serum albumin (HSA) 0.1% (the receiver solution) per well. In the insert corresponding to the apical compartment, 0.5 mL of RH-human serum albumin (HSA) 0.1% supplemented with 10 nM Aβ1-40Cy5 peptide was added (the donor solution). For basolateral-to-apical studies, filters were transferred to 12-well plates containing 1.5 mL of RH-human serum albumin (HSA) 0.1% supplemented with 10 nM fluorescent Aβ1-40Cy5 (the donor solution). In the apical compartment, 0.5 mL of RH-human serum albumin (HSA) 0.1% (the receiver solution) was added.",46a1f031-a832-4300-b4c2-38dc3c36255a
14,methods14," In parallel, the apical-to-basolateral and the basolateral-to-apical transport of 400 nM [3H]inulin was performed in the same way as the Aβ1-40Cy5 peptide transport, thus representing a paracellular marker. The BBB integrity was checked by measuring the PeLY as described in Section 4.6. For LPR1 inhibition studies, the basolateral-to-apical transport of Aβ1-40 transport was performed by adding 10 nM of Aβ1-40Cy5 peptide with or without 200 nM of receptor associated protein (RAP) in the basolateral compartment. For P-gp inhibition studies, the basolateral-to-apical transport of Aβ1-40 transport was performed by adding 10 nM of Aβ1-40Cy5 in the basolateral compartment with or without 0.5 µM of elacridar in the apical compartment. All transport studies were performed in triplicate on a rocking platform at 37 °C for 30 min.",e4d379af-1a26-4f11-b466-116adc37a523
15,methods15," At the end of the incubation period, aliquots of the donor and receiver solutions were collected, and the fluorescence compounds (Aβ1-40Cy5 and LY) were measured with a spectrofluorimeter (Synergy H1). The radioactivity of [3H]inulin was measured using a scintillation counter (Hidex 300 SL, Hidex, Turku, Finland). The permeability (apparent permeability coefficient, cm.sec−1) of Aβ1-40-Cy5 or [3H]-inulin was calculated according to the following equation: (1) Papp = (k.V(R))/(A.60) as previously described [91]. k was the transport rate (min−1) defined as the slope obtained by linear regression of the cumulative fraction absorbed (FAcum) as a function of time (min), V(R) was the volume in the receiver chamber (mL), and A was the area of the filter (cm2).",0985fb2e-76f0-4453-be25-d1a9c73fab3c
16,methods16," Determination of the cumulative fraction absorbed (amount permeated), FAcum versus time, FAcum was calculated from: (2) FAcum = ∑ (C(Ri))/(C(Di)), where C(Ri) was the receiver concentration at the end of the interval i and C(Di) was the donor concentration at the beginning of interval i. A linear relationship should be obtained. The apical-to-basolateral and the basolateral-to-apical Papp were determined by Equation (1) for each molecule. For each filter, the calculated mass balance was determined as described in Section 4.6. Experiments were performed at least 3 times.  4.10. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism 5.01 statistical software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
