Glycemia, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), body weight and fat mass were compared among groups. In liver and kidney, protein expression and histone post-translational modifications were assessed by Western blot, and gene expression by quantitative Real-Time PCR.

1,results0," After a 10 weeks HDF feeding, administration for 8 weeks of a KD or CD induced a comparable weight loss and decrease in fat mass, with better glycemic normalization in the KD group. Histone β-hydroxybutyrylation, but not histone acetylation, was increased in the liver and kidney of mice fed the KD and the rate-limiting ketogenic enzyme HMGCS2 was upregulated – at the gene and protein level – in liver and, to an even greater extent, in kidney. KD-induced HMGCS2 overexpression may be dependent on FGF21, whose gene expression was increased by KD in liver.  Conclusions  Over a period of 8 weeks, KD is more effective than a chow diet to induce metabolic normalization. Besides acting as a fuel molecule, BHB may exert its metabolic effects through modulation of the epigenome - via histone β-hydroxybutyrylation - and extensive transcriptional modulation in liver and kidney.",7c46d984-1369-409d-b10c-db4be825246e
2,results1,"  Highlights  • In mice fed a high fat diet, the dietary switch to a ketogenic diet causes weight loss and loss of fat mass.  • Glycemic normalization is superior than observed in mice fed a chow diet.  • Ketogenic diet induces mild ketosis, and β-hydroxybutyrylation on histone H3 lysines.  • Upregulation of rate limiting ketogenic protein HMGCS2 is observed in kidney.  • Ketogenic diet may be a transitory nutritional intervention to favor weight loss.

3,results2," induce the body to rely on ketone bodies as primary energy source [1]. Ketone bodies, of which the quantitatively major species is β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), are mainly produced hepatically from fatty acids precursors, and represent the major energetic source for the brain [2], heart, kidney [3] and other organs under conditions of carbohydrate deprivation.  In addition to its role of energetic substrate, BHB acts as an anti-inflammatory molecule [4], via inhibition of the of the NLRP3 inflammasome [5], and as a regulator of the epigenetic transcriptional state of chromatin by acting as a modulator of histone deacetylases (HDACs) [6,7]. BHB is also the substrate moiety for histone β-hydroxybutyrylation, a novel protein post-translational modification (post translational modification (PTM)) - taking place on histone and non-histone proteins - associated to gene expression [8,9].",60f71edb-780e-4706-a3c6-e3590ff39071
4,results3," The participation of BHB in the regulation of gene transcription and inflammation, together with its capability to prevent senescence of vascular cells [10] and enhance their proliferative potential [11] may contribute to its positive effects on metabolism.  Somehow paradoxically, feeding on an energy-dense ketogenic diet is akin to starving or caloric restriction, two other nutritional states relying on the mobilization of stored fat depots once carbohydrate availability becomes scarce: in both cases, BHB will serve as a fat-derived fuel molecule substitute for glucose [12].  In specific circumstances, the administration of a ketogenic diet has been proven to be of clinical benefit, such as in pharmacologically intractable epilepsy [13] or in GLUT1 deficiency syndromes [14].",a6391105-5aad-4790-96cb-8438b4a3bf5f
5,results4," The feasibility of feeding on a ketogenic diet, associated with the metabolic similarities that the ketogenic diet shares with starving or caloric restriction, promoted the hypothesis that the uptake of a ketogenic diet may be beneficial and contribute to improved metabolic health and ageing. In mice, long term administration of a ketogenic diet enhanced longevity and “health span” [15]. From the clinical standpoint, the effect of ketogenic diet is complex and sometime opposite effects are observed. On the one hand multiple studies show that KD is clinically useful to alleviate epileptogenic seizures in pharmacologically refractory epileptic patients [13,16] and is recommended in mood disorders treatment [17], on the other hand it was found that a KD aggravates neurodegeneration in mice with induced mitochondrial DNA toxicity in the forebrain [18].",80a0ff15-4f9c-4bab-98cd-dce33f5d5a28
6,results5," Also, while the KD ameliorates the clinical state of malignancies of the central nervous system in rodent models and humans [[19], [20], [21]], a firm proof from a randomized clinical trial is still missing.  In particular, a KD may have therapeutic value in situations where metabolic disturbance is associated with increased risk and severity of a given pathology, as in the highly prevalent case of obesity-compounded osteoarthritis [22]. Within this context, we investigated in mice the metabolic and epigenetic effects of a KD administered to osteoarthritic animals rendered obese by previous administration of a high-fat-diet.",849ab2d1-d8fd-4631-ae08-3b94a252b02e

Besides the observed loss in fat mass, administration of the KD may also affect internal organs, as the kidney weight was significantly lower in the KD group (Figure 1D). Glycaemia, measured after a 6-hours fasting, was significantly decreased in both CD and KD groups as compared to the high fat diet (HFD) group, with stronger glycemic normalization in the KD group showing a return to normoglycaemia (Figure 1E, upper graph). An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IGTT)), performed on an independent set of experimental animals, also demonstrated a significantly improved glucose disposal both in the CD and KD group (Figure 1F).

Figure 8  4 Discussion  While obesity should not be viewed as a disease per se, it is associated to most of the chronic diseases that are major contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and osteoarthritis [28]. Notwithstanding that the development of obesity carries a non-negligible contribution from non-modifiable hereditary causes [29], numerous studies addressing dietary, pharmacological and lifestyle treatments, alone or in associations, have attempted to solve the simple and urgent problem of inducing weight loss, with short term success [28] often followed by body weight catch up [30].",d8971031-49c8-49c7-836f-4881959bead0
31,results30," In recent years, the ketogenic diet has been proposed as a possible nutritional paradigm to reverse obesity. The ketogenic diet, in which calorie intake from dietary carbohydrates is expected to account for <5% of the total calories ingested [31] forces the body to switch to fatty acid metabolism and production of ketone bodies as primary energy source, recapitulating the metabolic features of caloric restriction or fasting. Studies in mouse models have shown that administration of a ketogenic diet reduces mortality and improves cognitive functions [15]; an extension of longevity (akin to caloric restriction) and “health span” was also observed [32].  Here, we attempted to move forward the study of the benefits of a ketogenic diet on weight loss by establishing a protocol in which mice were initially rendered obese by the administration of a high fat diet for 10 weeks and then switched to either a chow diet (CD) or a ketogenic diet (KD) for 8 weeks.",74b0d5be-0686-4d02-9e3f-e7d8251c63d9
32,results31," An experimental control group submitted to high fat diet for 18 weeks (i.e. without a dietary switch) was also investigated (high fat diet (HFD), Figure 1). All animals, before the dietary switch, were submitted to a destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery to induce osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a common chronic articular disease, particularly prevalent and severe in the obese population. Findings about the effects of the dietary switch on disease progression in this experimental model of obesity-compounded osteoarthritis will be published elsewhere.  The KD and CD were equally effective in reducing body weight and incidence of fat mass. As expected, mice submitted to a KD developed a mild ketosis, with a median concentration of circulating BHB of ≈2 mmol/l. A decreased glycaemia was observed in both the CD and KD groups, with the KD group reverting to an almost normoglycaemic condition.",5c4807bf-8418-463b-a613-dea482153aa2
33,results32," Our study protocol was inspired by a previous study in which a high fat diet (HFD) was administered for 12 weeks prior to a switch to a KD or maintenance of a high fat diet (HFD) as control [33]. In keep with our data, this study showed that a KD reversed body weight increase in mice previously fed a high fat diet (HFD) and [33]. In addition, we showed here that a switch to a KD is metabolically superior because of improved glycaemia, at least during an 8-weeks regimen, to a switch to a chow diet. These results indicate that a KD may be a useful transitory nutritional approach to reverse previously established metabolic disturbances. As a promising clinical translation of our observations, a recent study on obese volunteers with type 2 diabetes demonstrated that a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet was superior to a standard low-calorie diet in inducing glycemic normalization at 3 and 12 month after the start of the dietary treatment [34].",e8f44c6b-f974-4e2b-81c0-7a6b8fe4d8ec
34,results33,"  The numerous beneficial effects on inflammation [4,5], metabolism [9], and hypertension [35] of the ketogenic diet may be linked to modulation of gene transcription following histone β-hydroxybutyrylation, an histone post translational modification (PTM) promoted by BHB [8]. While global protein β-hydroxybutyrylation has been shown to occur on various organs in mice fed a KD for 4 weeks [9], we provide here, to our knowledge, the first identification of the specific increase of histone β-hydroxybutyrylation in liver and kidney. β-hydroxybutyrylation in skeletal muscle was absent both in CD/high fat diet (HFD) groups and in the KD (S. Nasser, unpublished data), suggesting the existence of tissue specificity for this histone post translational modification (PTM). In accordance with this observation, only a small number of genes, mainly belonging to the tricarboxylic acids cycle and cytokine/chemokine signaling were regulated in primary muscle cell cultures exposed to BHB [36].",b07326ce-e089-4749-b60e-18a16fb5d433
35,results34," The ketone body BHB is a precursor for histone β-hydroxybutyrylation [8] and was proposed to be a histone deacetylase inhibitor in the millimolar range when applied to cells in culture [6], a concentration that was reached in the KD group. While increased β-hydroxybutyrylation could be detected in the KD group both in liver and kidney, we could not identify any difference in histone acetylation, suggesting that, in vivo, at the low millimolar concentrations characteristic of sustained KD induced ketonemia (∼2 mmol/l), BHB may not be an HDAC inhibitor. Nonetheless, chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated lysine on histone H3 from liver and intestine tissues from mice fed a ketogenic diet revealed circadian oscillatory changes of histone acetylation that were higher in amplitude as compared to tissues from mice fed a control diet [37].",1d894b3a-27d5-4f4b-8e55-b1dc1f41047c
36,results35," Some of the genes that we found to be overexpressed upon the switch to a KD, namely Socs3 and Cpt1a, were similarly upregulated in the liver of mice subjected to a 48 h fasting [8]. Interestingly, these fasted mice displayed an approximately 2-fold increase in histone β-hydroxybutyrylation, but not acetylation, in the vicinity of the TSS of Socs3 and Cpt1a [8]. Other genes, including Hnf4a, Per1 and Ppargc1b, however, did not display this correlation (Supplementary Fig. 6). This may suggest that β-hydroxybutyrylation acts as a partly shared transcriptionally-promoting histone post translational modification (PTM) between the experimental situation of fasting-induced ketosis [8] and in the KD administered in our study.",e7d3ec9b-0269-45d9-a2e0-961f97044a1b
37,results36,"  Independently from the relative contribution of histone acetylation and histone β-hydroxybutyrylation to the modulation of gene expression, several studies indicate that the ketogenic diet induces extensive transcriptional and proteomic responses that repurpose the body metabolism to cope with the almost total absence of ingested carbohydrates [9,33]. As histone β-hydroxybutyrylation, that we observed upon switch to a KD is an epigenetic regulatory mark linking metabolic adaptations to gene expression, we evaluated the effects of the KD switch on the expression of ketogenic and ketolytic genes in the liver and kidney, representing the quantitatively major ketogenic organ and ketone bodies consuming organ respectively.",08687d8d-b234-4ed4-9d1c-8d63fea11d9d
38,results37," Higher expression of ketogenic genes both in the high fat diet (HFD) and KD condition indicate that the liver contribute to ketogenesis already in the continued high fat diet (HFD) feeding condition, but without detectable mild ketosis, irrespective of the presence of dietary carbohydrates. The switch to a KD was, however, affecting the kidney to a greater extent, as we observed an important upregulation of Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) both at the gene and protein expression level. Gene expression modulation in the liver of Fgf21 serving as a hormone promoting ketogenesis, Cpt1a, allowing fatty acids import in the mitochondria where β-oxidation and ketogenesis take place and the monocarboxylate transporter Slc16a1, allowing ketone bodies exit from the cell, all converge to support the notion that transcriptional changes occur in the liver and kidney to adapt the organism to the switch from a high fat diet (HFD) to a KD.",7707d5da-9072-4352-848e-c39fb5afc3ed
39,results38," A recent report using liver- and kidney-specific gene knockout of Hmgcs2 indicates that renal HMGCS2 overexpression observed in kidney upon fasting does not contribute to whole body ketogenesis [38], while the contribution of hepatic HMGCS2 is essential to avoid the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [39], as HMGCS2 would diminish the lipid load in the liver by redirecting lipids into ketone bodies synthesis. In the switch to a KD diet, we also observed a prominent downregulation of the lipogenic machinery, with substantially decreased gene and protein expression of the rate-limiting lipogenic AcCoA carboxylase (ACC) and Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) which can be explained on the basis that the KD fails to provide lipogenic substrates – i.e. carbohydrates.  Our results support the possibility that nutrition based on a ketogenic diet may, at least in the short term, lead to successful weight loss with improvement of metabolic parameters in obese individuals.",1555c1b5-e52a-4c45-a086-0efc58ec2999
40,results39," Recently, a small scale randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of a low-carbohydrate (<50 g/day) and energy-restricted diet in mildly obese diabetic patients for 12 weeks demonstrated improvement of multiple anthropometric and clinical parameters, including decreased body weight, BMI and fat mass, glycaemic normalization, and decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, accompanied with a reduction – to full discontinuation in some participants – of antidiabetic medications [40]. Similarly, a less stringent approach with a dietary reduction of caloric carbohydrate intake from 50% to 30% for 6 weeks showed a mild improvement of glycemic control and decreased circulating and hepatic triglycerides in mildly obese type 2 diabetic patients, although ketosis was unlikely to develop [41].",b5a1120d-1cba-485d-8e20-4999fefebc50
41,results40,"  Administration of a ketogenic diet has shown beneficial effects, at least in the short time course of the dietary intervention in women suffering of polycystic ovary syndrome (polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)), the most common endocrine disorder of women at reproductive age, associated with obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance [42]. In a pilot study on 11 women, administration of a very low calories ketogenic diet for 24 weeks led to significant body weight decrease and improvements of fasting insulin [43]. Similarly, Cincione et al., administered a ketogenic diet to 17 obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), observing the induction of ketosis and improvement of anthropometric and biochemical parameters including an improvement of the LH/FSH ratio, insulin sensitivity and HOMA index [44]. Whether modulation of inflammatory responses is critically involved in the effects of KD is still a matter of debate.",52821bc4-f8dd-4818-9f35-22e567758584
42,results41," While earlier studies in mice models supported the establishment of an anti-inflammatory state [4,5], we rather observed a general immune activation, with KD-inducing an increase of both pro- and anti-inflammatory factors. Our observation is in line with a recently published study on a small cohort of obese patients receiving a very-low calories ketogenic diet in which an immunomodulatory effect with increases in both pro- and anti-inflammatory factors was observed [45].  Despite its novelty in assessing the effects of a KD after induction of obesity by prior administration of a high fat diet (HFD), our study presents some limitations. Firstly, prior to the dietary switch from high fat diet (HFD) to a KD or CD, all experimental mice have been subjected to a destabilization of the medial meniscus (destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)), a surgical model to induce osteoarthritis that, although applied to all animals, may have had confounding effects on metabolism.",34accc2a-cc54-4c2c-9699-fd58ef8a25d9
43,results42," Secondly, our study protocol permitted ad libitum feeding, preventing us to define the relative contribution of food intake versus metabolic adaptations in the normalization of body weight, fat mass and triglycerides content normalization observed in the KD and CD groups. Finally, mice receiving the ketogenic diet, which contains 6% of available energy from proteins as compared to 20% in the high fat diet (HFD) and CD, simultaneously experience dietary protein restriction which, together with the carbohydrate virtual absence and fat overrepresentation, could contribute to the observed results.  In conclusion, our findings indicate that in a model of body weight loss the ketogenic diet can be, in the short term, superior to a switch to a normal diet (chow diet in mice).",0b51f3f5-5ce1-4743-8263-4db1787ad644
44,results43," Among the specific adaptations and responses elicited by the KD we observed an improved glycemia, lowered mass of kidney weight and occurrence of specific histone β-hydroxybutyrylation as a histone post translational modification (PTM) potentially governing KD-induced gene and protein expression modulation.
