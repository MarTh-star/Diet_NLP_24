0,introduction0,"Pyruvate is a pivotal component in intermediary metabolism, lying at the crossroads between cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism. The main intracellular source of pyruvate is glycolysis in the cytosol, which generates two molecules of pyruvate per molecule of glucose. Glycolysis-derived pyruvate then follows one of two major routes for energy production: conversion into lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) in a reaction that replenishes the cytosolic NAD+ cofactor pool, allowing maintenance of the glycolytic flux; or cytosolic pyruvate can enter the mitochondria to be oxidized to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH)), fueling the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Alternatively, mitochondrial pyruvate can be used in an anaplerotic pathway through conversion to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase.",4884114b-a762-4a70-9759-85f0232743fb
1,introduction1," In most differentiated cells, decarboxylation of pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) is used in order to meet the high energetic demands associated with specialized cellular processes such as the transmission of neuronal signals or muscle contraction [1]. In contrast, the strong anabolic requirements of proliferating cells are better met by high glycolytic rates, since several intermediates in this pathway serve as precursors for biomass production, including nucleotides and proteins synthesis [1,2]. This marked reliance on high glycolytic flux is a hallmark of highly proliferating cells, including many cancer cells in which a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) is frequently observed [2]. During embryogenesis, dynamic regulation of metabolic substrate utilization takes place, in which glucose utilization increases during the early, highly proliferative stages of development reaching a peak after embryo implantation.",d33c3719-6da5-4b79-82d3-3afe424214b0
2,introduction2," Vascularization and increased oxygen supply then trigger oxidative metabolism [1] allowing differentiation into different tissues [3,4]. Accordingly, mutations in glycolytic genes impair early post-implantation embryonic viability, while alteration in oxidative processes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) activity often results in embryonic lethality at later stages (~E9-E11), when mitochondrial metabolism becomes crucial [1]. This versatility of metabolic pathways therefore allows the developing embryo to adapt its metabolism to meet the energetic and anabolic requirements of the diverse cellular programs.  In order to fuel the TCA cycle and drive oxidative phosphorylation, glucose-derived pyruvate must enter the mitochondrial matrix. To do so, it is believed to diffuse non-specifically through the outer mitochondrial membrane via porins [5], before being taken up by a specific carrier to cross the impermeable inner mitochondrial membrane.",4683b175-75b2-45de-aa5f-5196cb1513ae
3,introduction3," The existence of a specific transporter has been postulated since the 1970s [6], and its biochemical properties have been extensively studied, including its specific inhibition by chemical compounds [7,8]. However, the molecular and genetic identity of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)) were revealed only recently by us and by others [9,10]. In mammals, the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is believed to be composed of two obligatory, interdependent subunits, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)2, which form a multimeric complex of so far unknown stoichiometry [10] to mediate pyruvate transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane.",01730d8f-4dbe-474a-80c1-c745cb2ad959
4,introduction4," These findings have led to renewed interest in the study of the physiological and pathological importance of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), since they have allowed the development of genetic and biochemical strategies to investigate and experimentally modulate its expression, regulation and activity.  Recent studies in both yeast and mammalian cells have revealed a close and reciprocal relationship between mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) expression and activity and changes in cellular metabolic programs. When grown under fermentative conditions, yeast cells express a carrier composed of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)2 subunits. In contrast, when grown under oxidative conditions they express mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)3 subunits, which results in the formation of a carrier with a higher efficiency for pyruvate import [11].",60a4e933-852d-49f3-9640-fdbb3fa10645
5,introduction5," In turn, the importance of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) regulation as a driver of changes in cellular and whole organism metabolism is also beginning to be explored. In cell culture models, several recent studies have reported that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) resulted in a decreased contribution of glycolysis-derived pyruvate to the TCA cycle. Instead of leading to decreased TCA cycling, oxygen consumption and cell growth, the oxidative TCA cycle flux was maintained through an increase in glutamine-mediated anaplerosis and fatty acid oxidation. In addition, to compensate for the reduced pyruvate import, some pyruvate was found to be synthesized in situ, in the mitochondrial matrix, by mitochondrial malic enzymes [12,13]. Finally, in several cancers, a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) activity has been observed [14–16], which correlates with poor prognosis in multiple colon cancers [16].",7dc18b88-3f6d-4f39-a501-7e725cb298e4
6,introduction6,"  Several mouse models of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) deficiency have now been published (mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)2 hypomorphic allele [17], liver-specific knock-outs of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 or mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)2 [18,19], acute mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) inhibition by UK5099 [20]), which showed defects in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion or gluconeogenesis, thus demonstrating a role for the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) in regulating whole-body glucose homeostasis. However, ubiquitous disruption of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)2 expression in mice results in embryonic lethality, and this has not been further investigated [17].  In this study, we have generated a whole-body knock-out of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 gene and we have studied the impact of ubiquitous loss of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) activity on mouse embryogenesis.",b881ce87-d188-4c73-ac27-da557dfc9d97
7,introduction7," We show that the loss of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 protein results in embryonic lethality at E12-E14, and perturbations of respiratory and metabolic profiles in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from mutant embryos. These changes were reversed by re-expression of a functional mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 gene. In addition, mutant embryos presented lesions in the pons region of the brain stem, and the metabolome of the telencephalic brain showed significant anomalies, including lactate accumulation and an imbalance in the levels of several neurotransmitters. Interestingly, both lethality and the brain metabolism defects were prevented when the pregnant dam was maintained on a ketogenic diet. Overall, our results demonstrate that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is required for normal mouse embryogenesis and brain development, but that the effects of its absence can be compensated, at least until birth, by a ketogenic diet.

11,results3," The mitochondrial content of each of the tissues analyzed was evaluated using an antibody against the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Tom20.  The efficiency of our gene disruption strategy was assessed by measuring mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 mRNA levels in embryos at E13.5. In mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/+ embryos, RT-qPCR showed that mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 mRNA levels decreased to about 50% compared to mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1+/+ (WT), while in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt embryos, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 mRNA was drastically reduced to about 5% of the WT level (Fig 1D).

16,results8,"  Under basal conditions, permeabilized primary mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt MEFs showed no detectable defect in oxygen consumption rate (oxygen consumption rates (OCR)) when pyruvate was provided as a respiratory substrate, but a major drop in oxygen consumption rates (OCR) was observed when maximal respiration was evoked by the addition of fCCP (Fig 2B and 2C). This defect was abolished by supplementing the medium with methyl pyruvate (Fig 2C) which diffuses freely across membranes and thus bypasses the requirement for the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) [21]. Furthermore, the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) inhibitor UK5099 decreased pyruvate-driven oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1+/+ MEFs but had no effect on mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt MEFs (Fig 2D), also indicating that mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) activity was severely affected in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt MEFs.",c482d5d1-2209-4044-a85c-5d3bf5552b8e

Western blotting experiments using spontaneously immortalized MEFs showed that neither mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 nor mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)2 could be detected in the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt derived cells (Fig 2E), suggesting that in the absence of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)2 is unstable and is degraded, as previously proposed by others [10,17,19,23].",f8f2d59c-79bf-4c55-a57c-df7322eff217

In the presence of [U-13C]glucose, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt cells showed a substantial decrease in the M+2 mass isotopomer fraction of TCA cycle intermediates and a corresponding increase in the unlabeled fraction (Fig 3B). The M+2 mass isotopomer results from the incorporation of glycolytic pyruvate into citrate via mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH), and CS (S1A Fig). The very low M+2 fraction measured in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt cells indicates that this route is blocked in the absence of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1.",b26fcb6a-7c9b-41a8-86af-0acb2cb134f5
23,results15," Using [U-13C]glutamine, we found that this amino acid was the main carbon source for dicarboxylic acids in the TCA cycle (Fig 3C) in both mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1+/+ and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt MEFs.

The lack of M+2 mass isotopomers is consistent with a lack of CS activity which in the mutant, prevents synthesis of [13C4]citrate from [U-13C]oxaloacetate (S1B Fig). The higher M+3 fractions indicate an increase in reductive glutamine metabolism (S1B Fig). This shift was confirmed in a labeling experiment with [1-13C]glutamine (Fig 3D), which allowed us to distinguish between reductive and oxidative TCA-cycle activity (S1C Fig).",f05151e8-9372-4e8e-962c-786aad61a7e6

In addition, in brain samples we found several additional changes in other pathways (e.g. proline, pyrimidine, glutathione), indicating the existence of pleiotropic effects of loss of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 on the metabolic state in E13.5 mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt brains.",2a5f2d0e-82fc-4863-a4b6-e471875171c4
34,results26," Interestingly, neurotransmitter levels were substantially affected in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt brain samples, where a decrease in glutamine, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)) and an increase in N-acetylaspartylglutamate (N acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG)) were observed (Fig 6C and 6D) suggesting that impaired pyruvate metabolism also affects the balance of neurotransmitter levels during development In addition, the phosphocreatine to creatine ratio (PCr/Cr) was low in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt brains following a normal dietary regime, indicative of an energy deficit in vivo (S3 Fig). Virtually all of these effects were abolished in E13.5 mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt mice maintained on a ketogenic diet (Fig 6C and 6D and S2B Fig).",dcad36cf-2935-4e84-af56-fa63c6de340a
35,results27," Under these conditions, the levels of most metabolites including amino acids, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), and N acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) were similar to those seen in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1+/+ embryonic brains samples. Levels of lactate and aspartate were still increased in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt embryos under the ketogenic diet (q < 0.05) although they were only increased by 30% compared to WT embryos (Fig 6C and 6D and S2B Fig).

36,discussion0,"The aim of this study was to understand better the physiological role of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) in regulating metabolic homeostasis in vertebrates. In the genetic mouse model described here, we used a gene trap strategy to abolish mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 expression in all tissues. Homozygous disruption of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 resulted in embryonic lethality between E12 and E14 (Fig 4A and 4B), and this is consistent with the results on the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)2 knock-out mice reported by Vigueira et al. [17] who observed embryonic lethality around E11. In the latter case, a frameshift mutation was introduced two nucleotides after the initiator codon likely resulting in complete loss of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)2 protein.",2537ac48-ddfb-4f27-b745-d6a7c22e55df
37,discussion1," In our model, approximately 5% of mature transcripts were still present in homozygous mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt embryos (Fig 1D), presumably because the splicing machinery may bypass at low frequency the splice acceptor site present in the gene trap. Even though no mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 protein could be detected by Western blotting (Fig 1E), we cannot fully exclude that low levels of functional mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) may persist. Thus, differences in the gene inactivation strategies could explain the slightly earlier death of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)2 knock-out embryos as compared to the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt embryos.  Targeted metabolomics studies using mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt MEFs, derived from mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt embryos at E13.",903cdec0-c7cc-4c72-b23f-69c418ddd62a
38,discussion2,"5, showed that citrate was barely detectable (Fig 3A), and our labeling experiments using 13C-tracers (Fig 3B and 3C) confirmed that the citrate synthase step of the TCA cycle is strongly inhibited in these cells. On the other hand, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) disruption led to a compensatory increase in the use of glutamine as a substrate for reductive TCA cycle metabolism. In addition, our findings based on metabolic flux analysis in MEFs cultured with [U-13C]glucose showed that the contribution of glucose-derived pyruvate to TCA cycle intermediates is strongly inhibited in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt cells (Fig 3A and 3B) to a greater extent than previously reported [12,13].",76e22878-860e-42ce-8a31-86f638eb23d7
39,discussion3," The absence of any significant residual contribution in the present study could be explained by a more complete inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) mediated by insertion of the gene trap cassette, compared to the approaches based on pharmacological inhibition and RNA interference used in the previous reports. This is consistent with the fact that neither mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 nor mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)2 could be detected by Western blotting in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt MEFs (Fig 2E) and that no residual pyruvate import was detected making unlikely the existence of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-independent pyruvate import activities in these cells (Fig 2D). This also indicates that in our cellular model, glucose-derived pyruvate does not enter mitochondria through alternative pathways, such as pyruvate-alanine cycling as recently proposed by McCommis et al.",c8edb26d-5995-4b86-a5e9-4e95a55a4e93
40,discussion4," [19], or through the action of malic enzymes that could convert pyruvate to malate in the cytosol, and convert it back to pyruvate after import of malate into the mitochondrial matrix [28]. However, we cannot exclude that these alternative routes or that additional pyruvate carriers may function in specific organs during embryogenesis, which could explain how embryos lacking the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) can reach E12 to E14 stage. These alternative mechanisms leading to pyruvate synthesis within mitochondria may also explain why the phenotype of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-deficient embryos appears to be slightly less severe than the phenotype of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH)-deficient embryos which die at around stage E9 to E11 [29], and in which the contribution of pyruvate to the TCA cycle is fully inhibited.",7b97203d-60b4-4f1a-a014-2e9749eaa4fc
41,discussion5,"  The cause of the death of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt embryos has yet to be completely elucidated although we hypothesize that metabolic acidosis is at least in part responsible for the phenotype we observe. Several years ago, Brivet et al. [30] described details of a patient showing impaired mitochondrial pyruvate import which was linked to a mutation in a gene which, a posteriori, was found to be mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 [10]. This patient was the first child of healthy consanguineous parents and presented at birth with hypotonia, mild facial dysmorphism, periventricular cysts, marked metabolic acidosis and severe hyperlactacidemia [30]. Consistent with this study, we found increased lactic acid in the telencephalic brain of E13.5 mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt embryos (Fig 6C and 6D) while Vigueira et al. [17] reported increased lactate in the blood of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)2 hypomorphic mutant.",d8252eb6-4c50-46d0-a453-ee89f3b3912d
42,discussion6," Any impairment in pyruvate oxidation, whether it be due to a deficit in mitochondrial pyruvate import as in our study, decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) activity [29] or defects in the TCA cycle or the respiratory chain [31], would be expected to result in increased reduction of pyruvate to lactic acid by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), greater release of lactic acid into the extracellular medium and consequently to metabolic acidosis. Long term metabolic acidosis results in multiple organ failure, in particular to defects in heart contractility leading to cardiac arrest [32]. The brain is also particularly at risk during periods of metabolic acidosis and, for example, the dysfunction of neurons which accompanies inhibition of the neuronal pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) activity has previously been shown to be the cause of embryonic lethality [33].",f011d188-b7e4-48b1-97a9-3f21925bed4f
43,discussion7," All these results argue in favor of acidosis being a major, if not the principal cause, of embryonic lethality of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) deficient embryos. This hypothesis is further supported by the findings that a ketogenic diet provided to the pregnant female from E8.5 onwards rescued the embryonic lethality of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt embryos and prevented lesions in the mesencephalon (Fig 5).  A ketogenic diet is commonly used to treat the lactic acidosis resulting from pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) deficiency in humans [26,27], and has been shown to have similar effects in experiments with zebrafish embryos [34]. Used therapeutically, the ketogenic diet reduces lactic acidosis probably by decreasing glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis, the main pathway induced in mammalian cells to compensate for a deficiency in OXPHOS.",c817400a-bac8-46dd-9183-edff2c0c340e
44,discussion8," The beneficial effects of the ketogenic diet may be immediate, through fueling the TCA cycle with acetyl-CoA, or delayed, through an epigenetic regulation of gene expression [35] in the embryos. In addition, the beneficial effects of the ketogenic diet may also be mediated through changes in the maternal metabolism thus changing the supply of metabolites and/or growth factors to the embryo. In our experiments, maintaining the pregnant dams on a ketogenic diet from E8.5 onwards reduced lactate accumulation allowing the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt embryos to complete normal gestation (Fig 5). We suggest that this is because the diet is able to sustain efficient oxidative metabolism, which is required during the later stages of embryogenesis for cell and tissue differentiation [1,3,4]. In agreement with this is the fact that the ketogenic diet rescued the energy deficit observed in vivo in the brains of E13.5 mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt embryos (S3 Fig).",67b0bb7f-1c6b-415a-9ae3-e25c17575200
45,discussion9," Moreover, in addition to the effects on lactic acid and energy balance, we observed that the ketogenic diet also normalized other metabolic parameters in the brain, including glutaminolysis which seemed abnormally elevated in untreated mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt embryos as evidenced by reduced glutamine and glutamate levels (Fig 6C and 6D). Under the ketogenic diet, glutamine, glutamate, and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were increased compared to untreated mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt embryos (Fig 6C and 6D) whereas the level of N acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) was decreased (Fig 6C). It was recently shown that gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission in neonatal mice is essential for cortical neuron development and the establishment of a proper balance between excitation and inhibition in the adult cortex [36].",4b0db070-5232-4382-bec6-c9716058a75d
46,discussion10," Together our results allow us to hypothesize that during embryogenesis, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) activity is required not only for adapting energy metabolism to the needs of the developing embryo, but also in maintaining a balanced pool of major neurotransmitters and ensuring normal brain development. It is already established that pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) deficiency is associated with severe neurological phenotypes such as developmental defects, ataxia, cognitive delay and epilepsy [24–27], the latter being caused by impaired energetic status and abnormal neurotransmitter metabolism [26]. In future experiments, it will be of interest to evaluate further the role of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) in modulating neurotransmitter levels and in regulating brain function.",6413e40a-5b2c-42bf-9dcf-e9d97eb53960
47,discussion11,"  Despite the ability of the ketogenic diet to restore normal metabolism and gestation of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt embryos (Figs 5 and 6 and S2 Fig), the newborn pups survive for only a few minutes post-delivery. This suggests that without nutritional support from the dam, which provides a continuous source of glucose and ketone bodies, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt pups were not able independently to meet their energetic needs during the post-natal starvation state. Loss of pyruvate oxidation and ketogenic supply in the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1gt/gt pups may be further exacerbated by the fact that autophagy-driven gluconeogenesis, an important source of energy during the post-natal period [37], is probably impaired in these newborn animals.",a2501a76-8c32-448e-9270-40c457e27cb3
48,discussion12," Indeed, recent reports indicate that liver-specific ablation of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) activity diminishes the gluconeogenic flux because of the relatively low efficiency of compensatory pathways such as glutaminolysis and pyruvate/alanine cycling in liver [18,19]. Our results show that global loss of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) activity is incompatible with embryonic development and neonatal survival in mammals.
