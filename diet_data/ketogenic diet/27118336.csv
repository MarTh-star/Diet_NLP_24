0,introduction0,"Obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide and is associated with negative public health consequences and large socioeconomic costs.1 A weight loss (WL) between 5 and 10% of baseline weight, if sustained, can have large health benefits by preventing or improving several obesity-related risk factors and comorbidities.2 Even though this can be achieved in the short-term with lifestyle interventions,3 most adults will experience weight regain in the long term.3, 4, 5  Maintaining lost weight is physiologically challenging, as diet-induced WL is associated with compensatory responses on both sides of the energy balance equation.6 These responses are driven by a cross talk between the gut and the brain, leading to an increase in appetite and reduction in satiety,7, 8, 9 concomitant with an overall reduction in energy expenditure.10, 11, 12 These mechanisms can reduce WL rate and increases the risk of relapse.",ae0b1607-1452-477a-bed9-b1627b6f9131
1,introduction1,"9 An increase in ghrelin plasma concentration13, 14, 15 and a reduction in the concentration of several satiety hormones, such as peptide YY (peptide YY (PYY)), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)13, 16, 17, 18 and cholecystokinin (concentration (glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP 1) cholecystokinin (CCK))13, 19 has also been reported with diet-induced WL.  To our knowledge, no studies to date have determined how appetite is affected with progressive WL. With a WL of only 1–2 kg being shown to increase subjective feelings of hunger,20 and a WL of 0.8 kg associated with an increase in postprandial total ghrelin and a reduction in subjective feelings of fullness,21 it is not surprising that adults find WL maintenance extremely hard. However, when carbohydrates and/or energy (using a very-low-energy diet (very low energy diet (VLED))) are restricted sufficiently to induce ketosis, the increase in appetite seen with WL appears to be absent.",07257c09-65f1-42f2-9821-007fe89df5b1
2,introduction2,"12, 22 This has contributed to the generalised idea that ketogenic diets are easy to follow. Most of the studies looking at the impact of WL induced with ketogenic diets on appetite have, nevertheless, been done in females22 and none has investigated how long time does it take for appetite suppression to occur under ketogenic diets. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to assess the timeline over which changes in both subjective feelings of appetite and appetite-related hormones are activated during WL with a ketogenic very low energy diet (VLED). A secondary aim was to assess if males and females respond differently. ",712fae2d-1755-499c-9fdd-6f3c1df1b39a

However, in our study sex responses were apparent. Males (which would be more easily comparable with Pasiakos and colleagues study33), displayed no changes in AG.21 Unfortunately, none of the previously mentioned studies measured ketosis during WL.  After 5% WL (12±8 days), feelings of hunger and desire to eat in fasting remained elevated, GLP-1 AUC had increased significantly and concentration (glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP 1) cholecystokinin (CCK) AUC was significantly reduced.",eb3659af-e615-4faf-9825-98fc098a4b4a

Previous studies using ketogenic diets and inducing a similar WL (6–8%) have systematically shown no change in hunger feelings.18, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 Even though some of these studies report a significant increase in fullness feelings (both fasting and postprandial),36, 38 others report no changes in feelings of fullness in the fasting state after WL.34, 35, 37  A study by Adams et al.,16 where participants with obesity (males and females) underwent 6 weeks of a very low energy diet (VLED) (7% WL), reported a reduction in hunger at 90 and 120 min, an increase in fullness at 120 min postprandial, as well as a decrease in postprandial total GLP-1 (but no changes in fasting).

All but one of the studies included in the analyses had average β-HB plasma concentration around 0.50 mmol l−1.22 It is surprising that hunger feelings in fasting in our study were increased on day 3 and 5% WL, but not at 10% WL, even though β-HB concentration did not differ from 5% WL.",c8d5011f-9828-488f-8b93-01f7a34180b6
25,discussion4," The reasons for this mismatch between β-HB concentration and subjective appetite feelings are unknown. However, it can be that participants got used to feeling hungry and that this perception therefore was attenuated overtime. Moreover, a recent review has suggested that other factors such as free fatty acids, reactive oxygen species and microbiota may also play a role.40  At week 9, with a 16±2% WL and ketosis, no changes in subjective feelings of appetite were seen, with the exception of PFC AUC, which was reduced compared to baseline in all participants and females. Basal active GLP-1 was significantly reduced in males and GLP-1 AUC was increased in females, while concentration (glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP 1) cholecystokinin (CCK) AUC was reduced in all participants and males.

It is possible that more than 2 weeks of weight stabilisation are needed for the concentration of satiety hormones to normalise. Another study by Chearskul et al.19 with an 8-week very low energy diet (VLED) (429 kcal per day) in 12 males with obesity who experienced a 15% WL, did not report any changes in hunger or satiety feelings, or concentration (glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP 1) cholecystokinin (CCK) concentration, either fasting or postprandial, immediately after the intervention, while in ketosis.",970a852f-c7df-4052-8e75-ee0b6e215d57
28,discussion7," However, 1 week later and without ketosis, a significant reduction in postprandial concentration (glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP 1) cholecystokinin (CCK) was described (opposite to our study where no changes were seen). Again, differences in the duration of the stabilisation phase might have impacted on the results. In a recently published study, Iepsen et al.41 reported a significant increase in fasting and postprandial total ghrelin, and peptide YY (PYY)3–36 and postprandial concentration of total GLP-1 after a 17% WL induced with an 810 kcal per day diet over 8 weeks when participants were out of ketosis. Differences in the hormones’ fractions measured may account for some of the differences.  The increased hunger feelings and AG plasma concentrations seen after refeeding (week 13) in the present study may have important implications regarding WL outcomes.",d315439e-5316-45d8-88c0-ff0c807d475b
29,discussion8," A recent study has reported that the increase in appetite seen with WL was three times larger than the corresponding reduction in total energy expenditure, highlighting the important role the feedback control of energy intake may have on long-term maintenance of a reduced body weight.33  Throughout the study period, a mismatch was apparent between subjective appetite feelings and anticipated relevant appetite-related hormones. Among others, there was an increase in hunger on day 3 (2±1% WL), despite no changes in appetite hormones except for insulin, and 5% WL, despite an increase in GLP-1 AUC and a reduction in concentration (glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP 1) cholecystokinin (CCK). Even though this mismatch can derive from lack of power, it is well known that the appetite control system is extremely complex and subjective feelings of appetite are not always correlated with the concentration of appetite-related hormones.",016af99e-3c4d-4daa-8762-f4faa6e4a349
30,discussion9,"42 Pre-lunch plasma concentrations of total ghrelin and peptide YY (PYY) were also found not to be associated with lunch energy intake in healthy women.43 Moreover, a recent review by Holt et al.44 concluded that self-reported appetite ratings of appetite cannot reliably predict subsequent energy intake.  As previously described, some sex differences were noted in both subjective feelings of appetite and appetite hormones with progressive WL. The fact that males, as opposed to females, reported no increase in hunger throughout the study (despite increased AG at week 13 (16±2% WL)) is surprising. Females were found to have a more sensitive neuronal response to food-related visual cues, which can contribute to the sex differences reported in the present study. Moreover, in our study, females had overall higher fullness AUC, and overall higher basal and AUC for AG, while males had overall higher hunger, desire to eat and PFC AUC.",d456968c-8cc0-4c3a-86da-75b290be18ba
31,discussion10," This is in line with previous findings showing that females have a higher satiating response to meals45 and lower ratings of hunger and PFC.46 It needs to be acknowledged, nevertheless, that with the very low energy diet (VLED) used in this study, males had a much larger energy deficit per day compared with females, which resulted in a larger overall absolute WL, and this might have contributed to the sex differences reported.  A strength of this study is its design; the fact that multiple measurements were undertaken during progressive WL under ketosis, and after a period of weight stabilisation and no ketosis. This is important, given that ketosis is thought to modulate appetite.12, 22 Moreover, subjective and objective aspects of appetite were assessed, both in fasting and after a meal. Compliance with the intervention was monitored throughout and was excellent.",36ed2f53-4fa6-474f-851f-c6683fa409b5
32,discussion11," The choice of time points is also a strength, given that it allowed to evaluate the impact of minimal, but significant WL (achieved at day 3), 5 and 10% WL, considered necessary to achieved health benefits,2 and large WL (16–17%) under ketosis vs no ketosis, on appetite outcomes. It is also a strength that we have adjusted for the increased risk of finding statistically significant differences by chance alone (by using Bonferroni adjustment for multiple time comparisons and the Benjamini—Hochberg method for multiple outcome variables).28 A limitation of this study is that it may be underpowered to examine sex differences.  This study has important practical implications for patients, clinicians and researchers alike.",ecbd2c90-506a-4c55-bf14-082c9e316ced
33,discussion12," Opposite to previous reports that the drive to eat is suppressed while under a ketogenic diet,19, 22 we have shown a transitory increase in hunger from baseline up to 3 weeks on a ketogenic very low energy diet (VLED), which then disappear and only come back after refeeding (and no ketosis). This information is of importance because it can influence patients’ expectations and adherence to very low energy diet (VLED)s.  Conclusions Progressive WL with a ketogenic very low energy diet (VLED) induces a transient increase in fasting hunger feelings up to 5% WL (3 weeks), despite no changes in AG and an increase in active GLP-1 AUC. A WL between 10 and 17% under ketosis is not associated with increased appetite feelings or AG plasma concentration, despite reduced fasting concentration of total peptide YY (PYY) and concentration (glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP 1) cholecystokinin (CCK) AUC. Increased hunger and AG plasma concentration return with refeeding (no ketosis) and weight stabilisation.",7a28c1c5-d111-4f9a-921c-c6257d732d98
