0,introduction0,"Clinical symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)), not only include motor disability but also cognitive deficits. Cognitive impairments are primarily learning and memory difficulties in 43% to 70% of MS patients during both early and late stages of MS [1]. Recent brain magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) studies in patients with MS have shown structural derangements of both the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus (a primary locus of memory consolidation). Moreover, convincing evidence of memory dysfunction in MS patients has been reported [2]–[4].",f78d0cf2-4b67-47ed-9ef9-4f9769dc8bd8
1,introduction1,"  Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)), a commonly employed animal model of MS – characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) – has been shown to recapitulate hippocampal injury and synaptic loss with resultant impairment in spatial learning and memory [5]. Indeed, the extent of memory decline, more than the degree of motor disability, has proven to be a significant predictor of social handicap in MS [6]. One of the hallmark features of MS/experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) inflammation [7], [8], which subsequently facilitates reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) generation in a feed-back manner [9], [10].",e6379b65-7a8c-4865-a4d8-06b93ae58ec7
2,introduction2,"  Intriguingly, it has been observed that learning and memory decline in models of Alzheimer’s disease and normal rodents is accompanied by a cytokine burst [11]–[13], whereas cytokine blockade prevents such cognitive impairment [11], [13]. Further, it is known that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation that exceeds cellular antioxidant capacity leads to disruption of hippocampal synaptic plasticity [14]. Despite the growing literature supporting the critical pathogenic role of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and aberrant reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)/MS, it is unknown whether these factors are directly involved in contribution to memory loss in both humans and in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model.  Dietary treatments have rapidly emerged as an alternative intervention for a variety of neurological disorders.",5d45a44c-7356-410c-89e4-1626852b3169
3,introduction3," Specially, the ketogenic diet (KD) has been shown to be clinically efficacious and safe in patients with medically refractory epilepsy [15]. The broad neuroprotective properties of the KD have been highlighted in a growing number of experimental models. For example, the KD attenuated amyloid beta 40 and 42 deposition in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease [16] and restored motor deficits in transgenic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) mice [17]. Additionally, either inflammation or thermal nociception was significantly attenuated by KD treatment [18]. While the mechanisms underlying such effects remain unclear, one possibility is that the KD decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by increasing the expression and activity of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins [19].",fb921438-7d04-4b3d-b614-83f59690fe8c
4,introduction4,"  In the present study, we asked whether inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in a murine model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are linked to memory dysfunction in mice. We found that impairment of spatial learning and memory in vivo and synaptic plasticity in vitro correlated closely with increased cytokine/chemokine expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Further, we observed that the KD significantly dampened motor disability, central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and memory dysfunction in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice, suggesting that dietary interventions may prove to be clinically useful in the treatment of MS.

31,discussion1," cytokine/chemokine expression and oxidative stress.  There is mounting evidence that an aberrant cytokine and chemokine burst characterized by T-cell proliferation may be a critical factor in the initiation of MS/experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [7], [8]. Although memory impairment has been shown to result from increased cytokine expression (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia and post-operatively [25], [26], the functional role of inflammatory mediators in MS/experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-mediated memory impairment has yet to be fully elucidated. Our findings strongly suggest that central nervous system (CNS) inflammation plays a major role in the memory impairment seen in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).",63fcce4d-87a5-42ca-a9ba-7925343b4268
32,discussion2," Furthermore, the broad modulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by the KD appears linked to the diet-induced attenuation of adverse functional and structural consequences in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that KD treatment increased the differentiation of Treg cells and led to a concomitant decrease in IL-6 and Th17 cell generation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), changes that are consistent with a recent study reporting similar findings in MS, and proposed to yield beneficial effects [27]. Collectively, our data strongly support the notion that the KD may be clinically useful in patients with MS.  It is well known that up-regulated cytokine/chemokine expression triggers reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) production, which subsequently promotes an inflammatory cascade in a feedback manner [10], [28].",ef7957ab-cb7b-4204-aaf0-8ec6f7bd0c9a
33,discussion3," The link between neuroinflammation and pathologic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is further supported by a prior study demonstrating elevations in thiobarbituric acid substances and F2-isoprostane levels (both indicators of oxidative stress) in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients [29]. Additionally, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by microglia and macrophage activation has been correlated with demyelination and axonal injury in both experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and MS [10], [30], [31].  Consistent with these studies, our data clearly indicates that in vivo reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is associated with impaired memory consolidation post experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induction.",3997e75f-5838-4a9e-8cd7-38c774197f4d
34,discussion4," The KD not only significantly reduces central nervous system (CNS)-derived CD4+ cells and CD11b+CD45+ cells, but also restores memory function in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice possibly by reducing in vivo brain reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. While this protective effect may be a consequence of decreased microglia and macrophage activation, we cannot exclude the possibility that the KD enhances intrinsic antioxidant capacity. Earlier studies have shown elevations in hippocampal glutathione peroxidase activity and catalase levels induced by the KD and its associated metabolites such as ketone bodies [32], [33].  MR imaging studies have helped solidify the concept that the memory impairment seen in MS patients is closely related to structural brain changes [3], [4]. Notably, the CA1 hippocampal region in humans becomes atrophic in the early stages of MS which then spreads to adjacent areas [34].",e6197bf8-7bff-4ed7-a44f-42d1b1d1a016
35,discussion5," This clinical observation is paralleled by a recent study demonstrating loss of neurons, synaptic integrity and memory impairment in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice [5]. In the present study, hippocampal volume loss in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice was also documented on MR imaging at the same time when impairment of memory consolidation was observed.  Many metabolic substrates [e.g., polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and ketones] and hormones [e.g., leptin and adiponectin] [35]–[37] are both elaborated and altered by KD treatment. Interestingly, dietary supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs – which mirrors one important facet of the KD – led to decreased pro-inflammatory and enhanced anti-inflammatory changes in models of MS [38]. However, whether PUFAs are beneficial in MS patients remains controversial [39]–[42].  There are other metabolic players that may be relevant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).",61da617a-da76-4419-b312-8d3298f945e5
36,discussion6," It is well known that both adiponectin increases and leptin decreases after chronic calorie restriction. Thus, it is of interest that calorie restriction – which shares some metabolic features with the KD – exerted anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [43]. Prior studies have demonstrated that up-regulation of adiponectin suppressed inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10) and led to weight loss [44], whereas increased leptin expression correlated with a pro-inflammatory action [45]. Additionally, KD-treated obese rats showed increases in adiponectin expression, weight-loss and down-regulation of TNF-α levels [37]. Thus, it appears that a metabolic treatment such as the KD or calorie restriction induces changes in specific hormones that positively modulate neuroinflammation.",4d56feda-77ad-4f94-a807-8dbf3801d0b4
37,discussion7,"  Another potential pathogenic mechanism in MS is hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in excitable demyelinated axons, which leads to decreased ATP production [46]. Furthermore, down-regulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein (uncoupling protein (UCP)) activity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) –which results in pro-inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation – was shown to induce serious motor disability [47]. In this light, it is interesting to note that the KD has been shown to provide synaptic protective effects in hippocampal slices under conditions of low glucose-induced metabolic stress, and was correlated with up-regulation of genes encoding mitochondrial ATP synthases [48]. Similarly, a more recent study demonstrated that ketone bodies alone afforded synaptic protection against the effects of mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors via enhanced ATP generation and antioxidant activity [33].",91c3f7c0-2fb0-463e-ad83-ec27c0a092cf
38,discussion8," Further, it has been shown that the KD increases the expression and activity of uncoupling protein (UCP)s in normal brain – effects that led to diminished mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation [19]. Taken together, the experimental evidence would strongly suggest that bioenergetic stabilization and subsequent reduction in oxidative stress may yield neuroprotective effects in MS/experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).  In summary, we have shown that memory deficits in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice are correlated with brain inflammation as evidenced by the enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. And importantly, the KD significantly attenuated brain inflammation and reversed both memory dysfunction and motor impairment in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice.",21349c67-e403-4593-9185-526749be96b4
39,discussion9," There is mounting evidence that metabolic substrates (and certain hormones) can reduce inflammatory responses, and as a consequence provide both structural and functional neuroprotective effects. Since the KD is currently available in many clinical centers throughout the world, patients with MS may readily benefit from this non-pharmacological treatment option. In light of the present study and supportive evidence from the literature noted above, prospective, controlled clinical trials assessing the therapeutic effects of the KD now appear warranted.
