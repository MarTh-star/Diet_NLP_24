0,methods0," Participants  Females over the age 18 years with history of AN for at least 10 years were recruited from the community through targeted advertisements. The study was approved by IntegReview Institutional Review Board, Texas, USA, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Participants were not compensated. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 04714541.  Potential participants were screened for eligibility by completing an online screening form, phone interview, and then video interview with the principal investigator. Eligible participants had a physical examination with their primary care physician, resting electrocardiogram, and laboratory screening including electrolytes, glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, complete blood count, prealbumin, lipid panel, acylcarnitine panel, serum pregnancy test, urinalysis, and urine tox screen.",8c51c605-0870-47c3-a2c3-d4f6c04a3112
1,methods1," Laboratory values had to be within normal range for study admission. Participants continued current psychiatric medications under the care of their outpatient provider. Of the 25 adults who were screened initially, 5 met criteria for participation.  A psychiatric interview (LC) assessed for psychiatric diagnoses and verification of AN with weight recovery. Diagnosis of AN was met using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and was confirmed with the Eating Disorder Assessment of DSM-5 Feeding and Eating Disorders (EDA-5) Version 3.0 (Adult). Participants also completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Clinical Impairment Assessment (Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA)) for Eating-Disorders, Eating Disorders Recovery Questionnaire (Eating Disorders Recovery Questionnaire (EDRQ)) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, (PHQ-9) (see supplement for detailed information).",eebdec61-6dfe-427f-8f7b-a939670feb9e
2,methods2,"  Design and procedure  The trial sequence consisted of a therapeutic ketogenic diet (therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD)), designed by an experienced ketogenic dietitian which involved a 2-day immersion program, home maintenance of nutritional ketosis for 4–8 weeks, followed by six titrated ketamine infusions. therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) was aimed at inducing nutritional ketosis but not losing weight.  Study settings  Immersive introduction to the clinical trial and the therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) occurred in person over a 2-day period for the whole group. Maintenance of therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) and nutritional ketosis occurred at home. Administration of ketamine infusions occurred in an outpatient private psychiatric clinic.  Immersion and maintenance of therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD)  Each participant was accompanied by an adult support person who was a family member or friend.",c41bade6-4388-4e77-8403-0999d5c14cb4
3,methods3," Immersion into nutritional ketosis using a therapeutic therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) focused on the following: encouraging three meals and two snacks daily of ketogenically balanced macronutrients of which fat would provide the main source of calories, followed by protein then carbohydrate. The macronutrient ratio of the therapeutic therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) used in this study was 70% fat, 20% protein and 10% carbohydrate. During the 2-day immersion program, all study staff (including psychiatrist, internist, experienced ketogenic dietitian/nutritionist, and peer support counsellor), participants, and their support persons met informally, prepared all meals together, and ate together. The patient who was the index case from our previous case report was present throughout and offered peer support.  Breath acetone is an accepted non-invasive indication of ketosis, although there is not direct equivalence between breath acetone and blood ketones.",deab74ef-e5ce-45b2-af28-6540a95ad0d4
4,methods4," Each participant was provided with Keyto (getkeyto.com), a commercial breath acetone meter, and measured breath acetone twice daily for 2 weeks, then daily for the remainder of the therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) phase of the study. The Keyto monitor reports levels on a 0–6 + scale, and the goal for each participant was to achieve and maintain levels of at least 4 throughout the active intervention phases of therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) and ketamine administration.  Participants were blinded to weight measurements, which were recorded daily for 1 week, every other day for 1 week, then weekly until study completion and obtained by a medical provider, the participant’s support partner, or ClearStep®, a scale without visible display that transmitted data directly to the research team.",a336425e-0483-414b-b217-a2b02cabdb29
5,methods5,"  Following the immersion program, participants returned home and were monitored for safety, therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) adherence and efficacy with daily phone calls, weight, and breath acetone monitoring, which tapered to biweekly monitoring by the end of four weeks. Weekly optional group meetings were offered by study staff for additional monitoring and support. After four weeks of demonstrated nutritional ketosis, participants could elect to continue the therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) for an additional 4 weeks before proceeding to ketamine administration.  Ketamine administration  Each participant received a total of six infusions of racemic ketamine within a 17-day period, modified from the planned 3-week period due to participant transportation and vacation plans. The initial dose of 0.75 mg/kg body weight and titration goal of 1.2 mg/kg administered over 45 min, was modeled after the index patient to accomplish dissociation [9].",86fe333f-fe26-4e61-a58e-aba86ee5c931
6,methods6," Pulse, blood pressure, respiration, and O2 saturation were monitored throughout the infusion and recovery periods.  Participants were given ondansetron orally dissolving tablets 8 mg before each infusion. Nausea and dizziness were managed respectively with intravenous metoclopramide 2.5 mg or oral meclizine 25 mg. Participants were prepared to expect dissociation by the psychiatrist.  Follow-up  After the sixth ketamine infusion, follow-up assessments were conducted weekly for 4 weeks, monthly for 3 months, then every 3 months until 6 months with plans to continue follow-up again at months 9 and 12.",70cb1cc2-7c83-4449-8351-29bca148f3fd

15,discussion0," This follow-up study on the previously published case report indicates that therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) followed by ketamine infusion treatment normalizes AN-related psychopathology. Weight remained largely stable in this cohort and the treatment did not result in any severe adverse effects that would have required stopping the trial.  All study participants reported improvement after therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) and more so after addition of the ketamine intervention. This raises important mechanistic questions. Genetic studies implicate central neurotransmitter function as well as metabolic mechanisms that contribute to AN [2]. Ketogenic diet provides an alternative energy source for cellular function and protects dopaminergic neurons against neurotoxicity [6]. Ketamine affects dopaminergic neurotransmission and normalizes circuits associated with emotional processing [7, 8].",f3a0b934-29f2-41a2-ad3b-bc8e84ba3538
16,discussion1," The underlying mechanisms due to therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) and ketamine that contribute to reversal of AN-related behaviors in this sample cannot be determined by this study. However, they are intriguing and require further study. During therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD), the brain shifts from relying on glucose as the exclusive source in “usual” circumstances, to utilizing ketones to supply 60% of the energy requirement. Changing the brain’s available energy source changes brain physiology and functioning, implicating effects on mitochondria, lipids as signaling agents, adenosine, neuronal stabilization due to less fluctuations in glucose, and changes in the gut microbiome [10]. It is possible that an alternative energy source is beneficial to reduce AN-related symptoms. However, nutritional ketosis also is associated with reduced inflammatory markers, which could contribute to the findings.",7145ec1b-4994-466e-97ce-8f05cda79365
17,discussion2,"  While the study sample was small, there were significant changes observed in symptom improvement, with large effect sizes. For some individuals, therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) provided significant relief from AN behaviors to the extent that they desired to stay longer on therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD). However, in all cases, the addition of ketamine provided additional relief, suggesting that there was no ceiling effect. One participant relapsed 4 months after the intervention and required a higher level of care. That individual did not remain on therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) and it can be speculated whether she would have remained significantly improved had she stayed on the ketogenic diet. It is possible that for some long-term therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) is therapeutic. Two individuals remained on therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) through the 6-month follow-up and have remained largely symptom free.",d1e68b38-63dd-48ef-8b6a-359030a5b7a8
18,discussion3,"  Strengths and limits  This well-designed study indicates that therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) plus ketamine is beneficial to reduce AN-related psychopathology. All participants were diagnosed with comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD), while some had anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)- or trauma-related disorders. Whether therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) or ketamine had specific effects on depression that subsequently improved AN-related psychopathology, or whether the effects were independent require further study. The sample size was small, participants were permitted to extend the 4-week adherence to therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) to 8 weeks before ketamine infusions, and to taper/discontinue the therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) following the final infusion. Ketamine dose was titrated and variable, and integration of the dissociative experience was variable.",308df4d4-2a8e-4b36-8653-e293f6b19dd8
19,discussion4," Other limitations include the lack of a control group, and the use of breath acetone as an approximation of ketosis rather than blood betahydroxybutyrate.  Conclusions  These results of this study suggest that therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) that is aimed to establish and maintain nutritional ketosis but not weight loss, followed by ketamine infusion treatment, is safe, effective and can provide symptomatic relief for individuals with AN who have weight normalized but continue to have severe preoccupations with fears of weight gain, body shape concerns and difficulties with self-acceptance. These results are promising and support larger studies to identify novel interventions to promote lasting recovery.  What is already known on this subject?  Animal research implicated ketogenic diet and ketamine as potentially beneficial to normalize brain dysfunction and behaviors in models for anorexia nervosa.",05e72b63-941f-46da-bd2c-2704951d7b57
20,discussion5," A case report in a person with long-standing anorexia nervosa showed sustained recovery after ketogenic diet and ketamine treatment.  What this study adds?  This study adds to the evidence that ketogenic diet and ketamine may be generalizable to individuals with anorexia nervosa in reducing symptoms. The results of the study support the need for larger studies in anorexia nervosa to test the effectiveness of ketogenic diet and ketamine.
