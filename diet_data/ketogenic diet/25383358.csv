0,introduction0,"Ketogenic dietary therapies (ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT)) can be an effective treatment for people with drug-resistant epilepsy (Henderson et al., 2006, Keene, 2006, Neal et al., 2008, Payne et al., 2011) and are the treatment of choice for epilepsy associated with the genetic conditions glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency .  In the absence of specific metabolic disorders, predictors of response to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) are unknown . Certain epilepsies, many of which are caused by single gene mutations, may respond well to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) (Kossoff et al., 2009, Nangia et al., 2012, Thammongkol et al., 2012), although further evidence is needed that epilepsies of different aetiologies respond differently to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT).",ea655525-c30b-481b-bfbd-437caa676536
1,introduction1," Strain-specific responsiveness to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) in terms of seizure threshold has been shown in mice (Dutton and Escayg, 2008). From animal models, two genes have been highlighted as candidates implicated in the antiepileptic mechanisms of ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) (Giménez-Cassina et al., 2012): KCNJ11, which encodes the Kir6.2 pore-forming subunit of KATP channels, and BAD, which encodes the minimal death domain BH3-only protein and also has a metabolic role (Danial et al., 2003, Danial et al., 2008).  BadS155A (from mice bearing a non-phosphorylatable knock-in allele of BAD) and Bad−/− cortical neurons and astrocytes exhibited increased mitochondrial utilisation of β-hydroxybutyrate and decreased utilisation of glucose, compared with wild types (Giménez-Cassina et al., 2012). These changes in energy substrate utilisation are reminiscent of the response to fasting or ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT).",c648ec6f-1258-4cdf-b66c-90c7576cd0ba
2,introduction2," BadS155A and Bad−/− mice showed resistance to kainic acid-induced seizures; resistance was diminished in Bad−/−, Kir6.2−/− mice. The open probability of single KATP channels was increased in Bad-deficient neurons, compared to wild types.  Gene expression changes can directly influence phenotypic traits; a major influence on gene expression is genetic variation (Fu et al., 2012, Grundberg et al., 2010, Williams et al., 2007). It therefore seems possible that individual genetic variation influences the efficacy of ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) on seizure control. We hypothesised that variants in KCNJ11 and BAD may influence response to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) in humans. ",a40f5f90-709b-41f3-b14d-a1f8f533e4d2

4,methods1," KCNJ11 sequencing data were received from patients from Massachusetts General Hospital, in collaboration with Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.  Criteria for study inclusion were: individuals aged ≥3 months who were either following ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) or who had followed ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) in the past for epilepsy. Exclusion criteria were: individuals who discontinued ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) before the 3-month point due to lack of tolerability (those who discontinued ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) before the 3-month point due to lack of response or seizure increase were included), individuals with known glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency or known to have other metabolic disorders, and individuals with progressive myoclonic epilepsies or other progressive neurological diseases.  In the UK clinics, all eligible for recruitment were invited to participate.",a0765978-5b09-4bd9-adaf-d20ccc1d0431
5,methods2," The majority of Australian participants were recruited prospectively.  Phenotypic data collection All underwent electroclinical phenotyping to establish seizure type and epilepsy syndrome. This involved medical history, seizure semiology, examination and review of EEG and imaging studies. Demographic data were obtained from medical records. The proforma used to collect phenotypic information is given in Supplementary Material. Apart from ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) response, detailed clinical data were not available for cases from Boston.  ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) response was defined in terms of seizure frequency. In 121 cases, response was determined prospectively and in 125 cases it was retrospective Response was estimated in 28 day epochs prior to starting the diet (baseline) and prior to 3-month follow-up after the start of ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT). Clinic letters and seizure diaries, where already used as part of clinical monitoring (in 35 [11.",8ae822b0-3e7e-47db-81ed-84846067122b
6,methods3,"6%] patients), were used to estimate seizure frequency at each time point. The calculation used to determine percentage reduction in seizure frequency was: [(a − b)/a] × 100, where a = number of seizures in the 28 days prior to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) initiation; b = number of seizures in the 28 days preceding the 3-month point (three months since ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) was started). A case/control study design was adopted. Those with ≥50% seizure reduction were classified as ‘responders’; those with <50% seizure reduction were ‘non-responders’. Seizure freedom achieved at any follow-up point was also documented. All cases received from Boston had diet response classified at the 3-month point.  For individuals with demographic data available, the effect of various factors on ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) response was assessed by logistic regression. Statistics were performed in R (R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",0c1eb991-382b-43a4-83ef-b29426ac3ffb
7,methods4," To avoid the inflated likelihood of Type I error when testing multiple hypotheses, a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold was applied.  Genotypic data collection DNA was extracted from venous blood using Autogen (AutoGen Inc, Hollister, Massachusetts, USA), Fujifilm (FUJIFILM Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) or QiaAmp Blood Maxi kits (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany).  KCNJ11 and BAD Sanger sequencing was undertaken in a clinically-accredited laboratory at the Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital. Exon 1 of KCNJ11 was amplified in three fragments, and the three exons in BAD were amplified using M13 tailed PCR primers (primers on request). Sequencing was performed using a Big Dye Terminator Cycler Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) according to manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were analysed on an ABI 3130 Capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and sequences were compared to the published sequence (KCNJ11: NM_000525; BAD: NM_004322.",8bf8bc6f-ebac-4daf-ac03-9c0027aa92a8

Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using public variant databases (dbSNP http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/, 1000 Genomes http://www.1000genomes.org/ and Exome Variant Server http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/).  KCNJ11 sequencing results were also received from Boston. The full KCNJ11 gene had been sequenced bi-directionally using three 500–600 bp amplicons with published primers . Sequencing was performed using an ABI 377 machine (PE Biosystems, NYSE:PEB) with Big Dye terminator chemistries (PE Biosystems, NYSE:PEB).

9,methods6," An alpha level according to the effective number of tests was used (two phenotypes and seven SNPs were effectively tested for in association analyses—two SNPs were in high linkage disequilibrium). As there is no naturally-existing ketogenic diet (or indeed sustained calorie restriction, at least in Europeans), disease (or trait) prevalence is hard to gauge. The estimated prevalence of treatment-resistant epilepsy, the usual subject population considered for ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT), was therefore used: a disease prevalence of epilepsy of 0.5% was used, as in other studies , of which ∼35% are thought to be treatment-resistant. The genetic architecture of response is unknown and so power calculations were performed using co-dominant, dominant and recessive penetrance models.  As shown in Fig. 1, with a sample size of 303 (as used in the KCNJ11 analysis), variants with a minor allele frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF)) of approximately 0.",d192ab58-65a0-4b5f-8418-b1e9f3634783
10,methods7,"05 and a relative risk of 3 could be detected with 80% power, assuming a dominant or co-dominant penetrance model; assuming a recessive penetrance model, the variant minor allele frequency (MAF) would have to be at least 0.3 if the variant had a relative risk of approximately 3.  Association analyses The following quality control filtering was undertaken: individuals were excluded for missing genotype rates >2% and excessive identity-by-descent estimates indicating genotypic relatedness (Pi-hat [proportion of identity-by-descent] score >0.4, calculated from genome-wide SNP data, which were available for 243 individuals); SNPs with deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, p-value <1 × 10−6, or missing rates >2%, were excluded (cases from Boston were analysed separately, as these did not have BAD sequencing data).  Fisher's exact test for allelic association was conducted in PLINK (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu) (Purcell et al.",64eba237-c30c-4409-90f1-81225de68846

Two response phenotypes were examined: one, with response defined as ≥50% seizure reduction at 3-month follow-up and another, with response defined as seizure freedom at 3-month follow-up.  The Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH)) test was also conducted to correct for population stratification. Each cluster was set as an ethnic group, which was self-reported by participants as genome-wide SNP data were not available for all individuals. The self-reported ethnicity clusters were: Caucasian (including Australian and American Caucasians, n = 251), African (n = 5), Middle Eastern (n = 6), Central/South Asian (n = 14), East Asian (n = 2), Black and Caucasian mix (n = 19), East Asian and Caucasian mix (n = 3), South Asian and Caucasian (n = 2) and South American (n = 1).  Unadjusted p-values were corrected using the permutation procedure (100,000 permutations).",b5d7222f-2608-45c4-a4e2-c5d9d62e9f2b

The demographic characteristics of these 246 participants are summarised in Table 1.  A further 57 individuals from Boston had KCNJ11 sequencing results and ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) response data available (KCNJ11 sequencing data were available for 58 individuals from Boston but response data were not available for one of these individuals). 176/303(58%) were responders at the 3-month point; 22/303(7%) were seizure-free.

With a sample size of 303, we had 80% power to detect associations of variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of ≥0.05 and relative risk of ≥3, depending on the genetic model assumed. Variants in KCNJ11 or BAD may have a smaller effect on ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) response, which we did not have power to detect. However, such effect sizes are unlikely to be clinically relevant when attempting to predict response to dietary therapies, though variants with smaller effect sizes may still cast light on the mechanisms of action of ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT).  rs5216 in KCNJ11 merits possible further investigation as it reached suggestive significance in the ≥50% seizure reduction phenotype analysis.",64fd2380-7d18-4b76-b5ee-d28fb4c03376
21,discussion1," In pancreatic β cells, the binding of adenine nucleotides to the Kir6.2 pore closes the channel; variants affecting this subunit could influence the open-channel probability and alter cell excitability . Considering the ‘KATP-glycolysis hypothesis’ (Yellen, 2008), if rs5216 were to alter KATP open-channel probability in the brain, this may affect the extent to which ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) depress neuronal excitability. The functional consequences of rs5216 on KATP channel activity are unknown. It is located in a conserved region and is rare in the general population, indicating that it may influence gene/protein function and may be damaging (Liu and Kumar, 2013). rs5216, however, is a synonymous variant and is predicted by SIFT to be tolerated.  The previously-unreported variants and those SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.01 in this cohort are unlikely to be important for most people following ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT)s.",b9d5725b-f4d2-4953-b565-4f75717b43e1
22,discussion2," They are not variants that influence response to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) shared across patients; most variants were only present in one or two individuals. The possibility cannot be discarded that other, rare variants in KCNJ11 or BAD, not found in this cohort, may play a minor role in response to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT). Deep resequencing with application of stringent genotype call probabilities may be the only way to identify the full extent of rare genetic variation in an individual .  This study has limitations. Due to the nature of dietary interventions such as ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) and the limited available of ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) in the UK, the sample size in this study is numerically small.",dad22b3e-f5e3-4162-b629-7b5baec414a1

Further international collaboration would be needed to obtain a larger cohort size. The time-points at which response is calculated also influence results. For many people with epilepsy, ‘responder’ or ‘non-responder’ status to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) is known by the 3-month point, but it may take longer to categorise response for others, for example, those with seizure clusters. Alternative procedures to estimate response may need to be explored.",0d1111be-4cec-4e6e-8d97-e42aef27cc2c
24,discussion4," p-Values were largely unaffected when including ethnicity as a covariate; whilst genetic influence on response to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) might genuinely not be confounded by population stratification, it is difficult to be certain with our small number of non-European participants. In future studies, the issue of ethnicity and response to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) should not be disregarded, as certain variants may be more relevant in populations with a more recent or longer history of survival through starvation. Most such populations, however, will not have epilepsy services with capacity for ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT), if indeed any treatment is available.  Our heterogeneous cohort is typical of individuals with complex epilepsy who commence ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT). Conducting association studies with narrower phenotypes, where patients are in more homogenous groups, for example, by epilepsy cause or syndrome, may be an option for future analyses.",ba460ca1-be5a-467f-8c98-1b91098cf9a2
25,discussion5,"  Conclusion We have shown that common variants in the candidate genes KCNJ11 and BAD are not associated with response to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) at 3-month follow-up. Associations from variants with a smaller effect size or rare variants may be detected with a larger sample size. It remains to be seen whether variants in other genes influence response to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT). An unbiased approach across the genome or exome is needed. This may allow us to identify biological pathways not previously associated with response to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) (Minihane, 2013).
