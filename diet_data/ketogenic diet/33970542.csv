0,methods0," 2.1. Study Setting  This is a retrospective cohort study conducted at the Salmaniya Medical Complex (Salmaniya Medical Complex (SMC)) in Bahrain between March 2018 and June 2021. The study protocol was approved by the Secondary Health Care Research Subcommittee (Subcommittee (SHCRC)) of the Ministry of Health, Bahrain (serial number: 23250221; approved on 25 February 2021). The study was conducted in full compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and written parental consent was obtained.  2.2. Patients and Data Collection Protocol  The cKD has been used as a treatment for children with drug-resistant epilepsy at Salmaniya Medical Complex (SMC) since 2010. Patients are monitored by a multidisciplinary team including pediatricians, neurologists and licensed dietitians. Patients were under treatment with these antiepileptic drugs (AED)s drugs: clobazam, oxcabazepine, levetiracetam, topiramate, phenobarbiton, clonazepam, sabril, vigabatrin, rivotrel and clonazepam.",c58831f1-9aae-4983-a51e-339cd906910f
1,methods1,"  Medical records were used retrospectively to identify all infants and children aged 0 to 14 years who were treated with cKD for drug-resistant epilepsy at Salmaniya Medical Complex (SMC) between 2010 and 2021. Patients’ demographic data were collected at baseline including sex, age at epilepsy onset, age at cKD initiation, epilepsy duration (time between epilepsy onset and cKD initiation), epilepsy diagnosis/etiology, number of antiepileptic drugs (AED)s used, and seizure frequency. Furthermore, biochemical (total cholesterol, TC; triglycerides, TG; alkaline phosphatase, ALP; alanine transaminase, ALT; gamma-glutamyl transferase, GGT; and albumin) were collected at baseline and at outpatient clinic follow-ups at 6 months, and anthropometric (weight, height, and body mass index, BMI) data were also collected at baseline and at outpatient clinic follow-ups at 12 months.",5915576b-2a71-4840-9517-af315692dcb2
2,methods2,"  cKD efficacy in patients was categorized into three categories: responders (>50% seizure reduction), non-responders (<50% seizure reduction) and seizure freedom after a follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months. Diet information of cKD type, route of feeding, cKD duration and reason of cKD discontinuation were recorded as well.  The World Health Organization (WHO) growth reference and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)) reference chart were used to determine z-scores for weight-for-age, height-for-age, BMI-for-age, and weight-for-length. World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards were used for children less than 2 years old, while Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts were used for children aged 2 years and older as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",eedd12a0-efbc-45b3-a893-d1f6970a1e47
3,methods3," Differences in baseline and 12 months follow-up after cKD initiation z-scores were calculated for height (∆ height z-score), weight (∆ weight z-score) and BMI (∆ BMI z-score).  2.3. Ketogenic Diet Protocol  Following a standardized protocol [3], patients were admitted to Salmaniya Medical Complex (SMC) for cKD initiation for an average of 3–4 days. The macronutrients distribution of the prescribed diet was around 90%, 6% and 4% of total calories intake from fat, protein and carbohydrate, respectively. Compared to the normal diet that is typically composed of 45–65% of calories from carbohydrate, 20–35% from fat and 10–35% from protein, it may seem an unbalanced diet. The diet was advanced daily by either one-third energy interval, with a constant cKD ratio, until full energy requirements were achieved, or by daily advancement of a cKD ratio from 1:1 or 2:1 to 3:1 or 4:1 with total energy provided.",a4005ac8-6313-4c3e-acd1-83c67288a482
4,methods4," The fasting protocol (12 h) prior to KD initiation was applied for all patients between 2010 and 2018. Since 2019, the non-fasting protocol was utilized following the updated recommendations of the International Ketogenic Diet Study Group on the optimal management of children receiving the cKD [3]. No supplementations of multivitamin or potassium citrate have been included into the protocol. The KetoCal® KD formula (Nutricia North America, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was used as the sole source of nutrition for both infants < 6 months old and enterally fed patients. In addition, KetoCal® was used to supplement the intake of other orally fed patients. During admission, patients were closely monitored for ketosis and hypoglycemia.",54437b45-23ff-4275-a43e-e6672285c40f
5,methods5," After verification of cKD tolerance and positive urinary or blood ketones was achieved, patients were discharged from the hospital and followed up in the dietetic outpatient clinic every 3 and 6 months to monitor cKD efficacy and tolerability and to assess growth and biochemical status.  After discharge, caregivers were instructed to monitor urine ketones several times per week to ensure cKD adherence and monitor the ketosis level. If the level of ketosis was low at follow-up (urine ketones less than 80 mg/dL), the ketogenic ratio was increased. After 6 months of cKD, the discontinuation rate was reported. This paper did not include data about the hydroxybutyrate, since the database had incomplete data related to this outcome, since the data collection was provided by the caregivers.  2.4.",afb95b66-b84e-4330-bdb1-bae6ee8c750d
6,methods6," Statistical Analysis  A retrospective open label, experimental pre–post study was designed, and sample size was not determined a priori because the subjects were n > 12, as previously suggested by Julious [19]. R software version 3.5.3 was used to perform the statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics of the sample were performed using median and interquartile range values and frequencies. Attrition was treated by complete cases analysis, as recommended by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for exploratory studies [20].  Non-normally distributed data were checked by Shapiro–Wilk test. Generalized estimating equation (Generalized estimating equation (GEE)) models [20,21] for repeated measures were employed to ascertain the changes in outcomes among individuals across time.",02c9c349-d4cb-44ef-96af-4fbe642b0397
7,methods7," Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were selected due to their strength for missing values and the possibility of managing the intra-subject variability resulting from the different measurements performed on each patient [22]. For each outcome, a Gaussian Generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was fitted in which the time reflected a categorical two-level variable (i.e., follow-up measurement (post-) or baseline (pre-), with baseline as reference) with the ‘‘focus’’ predictor. An ‘‘identity’’ link was used to fit the Gaussian Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. The Generalized estimating equation (GEE) time parameters (ΔT) were interpreted as mean differences of the outcome at the follow-up time (t1) from baseline (t0). Furthermore, a stratified analysis considering the two cKD types, 4:1 (n = 9) and 3:1 (n = 13), was performed.",8d2ccbb2-17cb-4fee-abf8-6650534ac9c3
8,methods8," A Generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was fitted, where the time reflected a categorical two-level factor, based on the number of time points (i.e., baseline (t0) as reference and the last measurement (t1)) and the type (i.e., “4:1” or “3:1”, with “3:1” as reference), and their interaction terms were ‘‘focus’’ predictors. Accounting for these Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, ΔT were interpreted as mean differences of the outcome at the time point t1 from baseline in the 3:1 group; the interaction parameters (ΔTxTy) were interpreted as mean differences of the outcome between type at a given time point. Finally, type-associated parameters (ΔTy) were interpreted as baseline mean differences between type. Wald tests were performed, and statistical significance for model variables was assessed by 95% confidence intervals. Two-tailed p-values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.  3.

9,methods9," Demographic and Clinical Data  Initially, 37 epileptic patients treated with cKD at Salmaniya Medical Complex (SMC) were identified from medical records. However, 13 patients were excluded due to insufficient information. Therefore, the final study cohort consisted of 24 children (13 males and 11 females) who were treated with cKD for drug-resistant epilepsy. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample are summarized in Table 1. The seizure etiologies were known only in 11 patients: genetics (n = 8), structural (n = 2) and infectious (n = 1). The identified epilepsy syndromes were infantile spasm (n = 5), epileptic spasm (n = 5), Ohtahara syndrome (n = 3), myoclonic epilepsy (n = 2) and one case each of Rett syndrome, multifocal seizure syndrome, complex partial seizure, myoclonic encephalopathy, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and Aicardi syndrome. The mean age at epilepsy onset was 6.25 months (age ranged between 4 months and 11.",f41bcb7f-2502-42fd-98ca-723b62482e95
10,methods10,"25 years), whereas at cKD initiation, it was 27.6 months (age ranged between 4 months and 8 years). All patients received cKD, with a 3:1 ratio in 62.5% (n = 15) and 4:1 ratio in 37.5% (n = 9) of the patients, respectively. Oral feeding was the administration route for the majority of the study population (79.17%, n = 19), except for five patients (20.83%) who were on enteral feeding. The mean duration of the cKD was 22 months (range between 3 months and 6 years). The mode of antiepileptic drugs (AED)s drugs was 2 (IQR: 1–5).  3.2. Efficacy on Seizure Reduction at 3 and 12 Months Follow up  In total, 14 patients (58.3%) were cKD responders with >50% seizure reduction at 3 months, and one-third (33.3%) achieved seizure freedom at 12 months. However; 10 patients (41.7%) were non-responders (<50% seizure reduction).  3.3. General Characteristics of the Sample  As shown in Table 1, 24 children (13 males and 11 females) were treated.",b5c0e8af-28d1-49a9-8712-21995398dd01
11,methods11," The seizure etiology was known in 11 patients: eight patients had genetic causes, two had structural causes, and one was infectious. The identified epilepsy syndromes were Ohtahara syndrome (n = 3), Rett syndrome (n = 1), epileptic spasm (n = 5), multifocal seizure syndrome (n = 1), complex partial seizure (n = 1), myoclonic encephalopathy (n = 1), infantile spasm (n = 5), Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome (n = 1), Aicardi syndrome (n = 1), and myoclonic epilepsy (n = 2).  The mean age at epilepsy onset was 7 months (IRQ: 36 months), whereas at cKD initiation, it was 24 months (IQR 28.5 months). All patients received cKD, with a 3:1 ratio in 62.5% (n = 15) and a 4:1 ratio in 37.5% (n = 9) of the patients. Oral feeding was the administration route for the majority of the study sample (79.17%, n = 19), except for five patients (20.83%) who were on enteral feeding.

12,methods12," Effect on Biochemical Markers  Table 2 shows the median and IQR for biochemical markers at baseline and 6 months follow-up. All biomarkers were within the normal range. In Table 3, concerning Generalized estimating equation (GEE) modeling, the previous significant mean increases of triglycerides (ΔT = 1.47, p = 0.002) and albumin (ΔT = 4.30, p = 0.034) were detected by pre–post modeling (see Table 3). The significant increase in triglycerides was also confirmed in the cKD type interaction modeling (ΔT = 1.46, p = 0.010). Although the mean value of TC and ALT increased by 0.21 mmol/L and 6.29 U/L, respectively, after cKD initiation, the difference was statistically not significant. Additionally, insignificant reductions of both ALP and GGT mean levels were observed. Notably, no cKD type interactions resulted in significant biochemical outcomes (Table 3). Figure 2 shows the interaction plots of the biochemical outcomes between time and cKD type (cKD ratio 3:1 versus cKD ratio 4:1).  3.5.",98b9fd59-55eb-46b9-8d9e-4834754ec8a9
13,methods13," Effects on Growth  Table 4 shows the change in growth after 12 months of cKD. From baseline to 12 months follow-up, the median z-scores for weight, height and BMI (or weight-for-length) z-score did not show a statistically significant change.  3.6. Predictive Factors for cKD Efficacy  Figure 3 represents the correlations between positive response to cKD (>50% seizure reduction) and the different baseline variables. The blue lines denote positive correlations, and the numbers represent the correlations between variables.  cKD duration was the highest correlated variable with cKD efficacy (0.76), which was followed by age at xKD initiation (0.47). The number of antiepileptic drugs (AED)s drugs was not correlated with the duration of cKD.  3.7. Reasons for cKD Discontinuation  The cKD was discontinued by 14 patients (58.3%) at 6 months.",6dd12177-9825-4a52-adda-e9c3cd6c4299
14,methods14," The reported reasons of discontinuation were inefficacy (n = 8), poor compliance (n = 3), food refusal (n = 1), achieved required efficacy (n = 1) and death (n = 1). The death case had lost follow-up, and death happened outside Bahrain. Although no detailed information could be obtained, it was most probably related to the disease complications and not the cKD.  4. Discussion  The cKD was effective in reducing seizures by over 50% in 58.3% of children after 3 months of cKD initiation in Salmaniya Medical Complex (SMC) in order to treat drug-resistant epilepsy. Furthermore, 33.3% of the total sample achieved seizure freedom after 1 year of cKD initiation. This study reports similar results in accordance with Chen and Kossoff [23], who reported a response rate of 55% and seizure freedom in 35% of their total sample following cKD initiation.",08371ac4-e062-4f26-90c9-15d9239570a8
15,methods15," Nevertheless, the response rate observed in this study was lower than that reported by several previous studies which ranged between 70 and 90% [24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. This might be explained by the low retention rate (41.7%) in this study. Out of a total of 24 children who started the cKD, 14 patients (58.3%) discontinued the diet at different time points for several reasons.  The present study examined the impact of cKD on the biochemical indices of the children, particularly lipid profile and LFT. In terms of lipid profile, an increase was observed in both triglycerides and TC levels after cKD treatment, but the increase was significant only for the triglycerides. These findings are in line with both Dressler et al. [31] and Pires et al. [32] who have shown an increase in triglyceride level with the cKD. Furthermore, TC levels were significantly higher in the cKD group compared to the care-as-usual (control) group as reported by Lambrechts et al.",e529631c-fbec-4c02-9bac-35d0663c7b60
16,methods16," [33] in their randomized control trial of children with refractory epilepsy. Hyperlipidemia is a well-known side effect of almost all KDTs, but the effect may be transient [34] and does not prevent continuation of the treatment with adequate diet modifications [35,36,37,38]. Further studies to evaluate the long-term risk of these elevations in lipid profiles in both children actively receiving the ketogenic diet and those who discontinued it years prior are necessary.  Arslan et al. [39] investigated the hepatic effect of cKD in children with drug-resistant epilepsy and reported elevated levels of ALT and AST after one month of cKD initiation. Similarly, an increase in ALT levels was also observed in this study. On the other hand, ALP and GGT levels were reduced during the cKD. More studies are needed to explain the cKD-induced liver problems.  Hypoalbuminemia was previously reported as one of the side effects of cKD [40].",0c40e11c-7acc-4c8f-af5d-b2c5f8238719
17,methods17," This is in contrast with the present study where a significant increase in albumin was observed during the cKD period. On the other hand, Martins et al. [41] and Arslan et al. [39] both reported insignificant changes in albumin levels with cKD. This improvement in albumin levels in the study sample can be attributed to the adequate protein in the cKD meal plans provided to the patients containing high biological value protein sources. In addition, this study found no significant variation in biochemical markers in terms of different cKD ratios (3:1 versus 4:1). This finding is in line with a previous randomized open-label study which found no significant difference in biochemical parameters between different KD ratios (4:1 versus 2.5:1) [41].  When considering the growth of children who started the cKD, the mean z-scores for height, weight, and BMI (or weight-for-length) did not change significantly at 12 months follow-up compared to the baseline values.",736878d0-445e-4700-aafe-61ff7b3cd63c
18,methods18," The present finding is comparable to the findings of Tagliabue et al. [42] and Ferraris et al. [17] who reported constant growth z-scores after 6 and 12 months of cKD, respectively.  These results can be explained by the fact that patients of this study had received adequate calories, in addition to the intensive follow-up program provided at Salmaniya Medical Complex (SMC), which allowed patients access to dietitians by phone for diet troubleshooting and ensuring compliance with the KD that meets energy requirements. Furthermore, most of the study patients were receiving a specialized ketogenic formula to supplement their food intake, which further improved their calorie intake. In addition, more importantly, this result indicates that calorie needs can be fulfilled by cKD to promote the normal growth of children.",89f6f901-fd44-4908-b9d6-cd162d70a4dd
19,methods19,"  The findings of this study found a favorable response to cKD being correlated with the duration of cKD, age at cKD initiation, epilepsy duration, and number of antiepileptic drugs (AED)s at baseline. These factors have also been identified in several studies as predictors of cKD efficacy [24,32,43]. However, in line with Coppola et al. [44], cKD efficacy in this study cohort was not associated with sex and baseline weight. Interestingly, cKD duration was the most variable positively correlated with efficacy, which suggests that patients are more likely to adhere to the cKD if they achieved a positive response.  In the present study, inefficacy was the most reported reason for discontinuing the cKD by the majority of the study sample followed by poor compliance. These results coincide with previous studies which reported that inefficacy was the factor most associated with cKD withdrawal [14,15,22,23,24,25,37,41,42,43,44,45].",ad78458b-1940-48bc-81c8-fdd9f2cc199f
20,methods20," Acceptance of the diet was another factor that contributed to the compliance and adherence of the diet. This is in line with the Indian study by Baby [46], who reported that poor compliance was one of the most common reasons of KD discontinuation in 74 south Indian children whose usual diet is rich in carbohydrates, especially rice. Thus, the cultural tolerability was a main contributor to cKD adherence, which emphasizes the importance of customizing recipes to better suit the cultural dietary preferences. A less restrictive diet (low glycemic index treatment (LGIT)) was found to be more acceptable than the more restrictive cKD in an Iranian study by Karimzadeh et al. [47]. This suggests that these less restrictive diets can be used as another approach to increase cKD adherence.  Despite the efficacy of cKD in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, it may convey clinical and nutritional risks, including hyperlipidemia and hepatic side effects.",c2814b9e-ec85-4476-8bab-961705c2e7fb
21,methods21," In this study, a significant increase in triglycerides was observed after cKD initiation, as well as the increase in levels of the liver enzyme ALT. Consequently, it is highly recommended to closely monitor liver enzymes and lipid profile and to focus on healthy fats such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats instead of unhealthy saturated fats when preparing dietary plans for these patients. However, the cKD had no significant influence on the growth parameters of the studied patients at 12 months follow-up.  cKD efficacy was highly correlated with the duration of cKD in this study, which indicates that a positive response increases the adherence to cKD. Furthermore, cKD tolerance in terms of absence of side effects is another factor that affected the adherence in the cohort.  Interestingly, this study is the first study conducted in Bahrain to evaluate cKD treatment for childhood drug-resistant epilepsy, which makes it a valuable contribution in the existing literature.",7619d1a1-baaf-49ad-b4b6-24f3c3262780
22,methods22," However, like other studies, this study has a number of limitations, including its retrospective nature and the small sample size. In addition, it was not possible to exclude the effect of antiepileptic drugs (AED)s on liver enzymes. Moreover, the absence of ketonemia levels was another important limit.  It is highly recommended that future research includes larger sample sizes and a prospective study design to assess the nutritional and clinical effects of cKD, both in the short and long term. In addition, other benefits of cKD in terms of quality of life can be investigated in patients with epilepsy. Finally, other less restrictive types of cKD including medium chain triglyceride KD (MCTKD), modified Atkins and low-glycemic index diets could be evaluated in future studies.
