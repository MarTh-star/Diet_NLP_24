0,methods0,"2.1. Participants Seventy-two volunteers were recruited for the KetoPerformance study [6] (registered at germanctr.de as DRKS00009605), out of which 42 could be allocated to the KD intervention and successfully finished the 6-week intervention study. Twelve of these 42 subjects were recruited for the present ancillary MR study. The subjects’ age was in the range of 30–67 years (mean 48.4 ± 11.3) and the Body mass index (BMI) range was 22.3–33.3 kg/m2 (mean 25.8 ± 2.8). In addition to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the main study [6], magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contraindications including unsafe ferromagnetic or functional MR implants as well as claustrophobia applied. All subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Albert-Ludwig University Freiburg (494/14).  2.2.",aad9ead6-8ce4-4d5c-88d5-f08baa1cb9f9
1,methods1," Study Design and Intervention This study had a single arm before-and-after comparison design. The experimental intervention consisted of a KD without caloric restriction lasting six weeks (42 days) with a preceding preparation period including detailed instructions during teaching classes and individual counselling by a dietitian. Day one and day 42 will subsequently be denoted as PRE and POST, respectively. More details about study design and intervention as subjects of the main study are given in reference [6].   2.3. Data Acquisition Except of MR-examinations all testing procedures were performed at the Institute for Exercise- and Occupational Medicine in the morning between 07:00 and 09:30 after an overnight fast lasting at least 8 h. The subjects were not allowed to exercise the day before, and were advised to arrive to the examinations without any physical effort. Our endpoints are hereafter described in the chronological order recorded at PRE and POST.",6a9636ea-09b1-4a89-896a-329cc70143d0
2,methods2," Fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (fat free mass (FFM)) were determined via air displacement plethysmography (air displacement plethysmography (ADP)) using the BodPod device (Cosmed USA Inc., California, CA, USA), which was calibrated prior to each use according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. By using bioelectrical impedance analysis bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) 2000-M (Data Input, Pöcking, Germany) following a standardized procedure according to guidelines [16], body compartments FM, fat free mass (FFM), and body cell mass were determined. More details about air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) methodologies of the main study are given in reference [6].   All MR experiments were performed on a 3T MR system (Magnetom Trio, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) at the Department of Radiology, Medical Physics.",c76766ef-e551-4579-ac68-181336810e85
3,methods3," Two six-channel body array coils, a spine array coil integrated into the patient table for signal reception, and a MR protocol employed in previous studies [17,18] were used. The subjects underwent the following MR protocol on the first day of the study, before KD intervention (PRE) and the last day of the study, which was day 42 (POST). A Dixon-based sequence [19] covering the abdomen at least between the top of the femoral heads and the liver apex was used for fat/water imaging.  Figure 1 gives an overview of the measurement locations within the abdomen. Furthermore, under free breathing and prospective acquisition correction (prospective acquisition correction (PACE)) based on navigator triggering, liver magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and spectroscopy (MRS) was performed using single voxel point-resolved spectroscopy (point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS)).",348ede45-96c7-488e-9123-5e91dfab3bfc
4,methods4," The measurement voxel (3 × 3 × 3) cm3 was positioned in the lateral part of the liver, avoiding the liver edges as well as contamination from larger blood vessels. Using this setup, non-water-suppressed as well as water-suppressed magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and spectroscopy (MRS) data (Figure 4) with 64 spectral averages were acquired using an echo time (TE) 35 ms and a minimal repetition time (TR) of 1 s.  2.4. Data Post Processing Fat and water images were reconstructed from the acquired multi-TE gradient echo MR data using the graph cuts algorithm [20], and intra-abdominal and subcutaneous fat volumes were determined. Using mean density values [21,22] allows estimation of corresponding fat and fat-free masses [17]. For tissue segmentation and fat quantification, a MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) based analysis pipeline was used [17].",4ff52049-92d3-4bbf-8749-88d39dcb378a
5,methods5," This included a semi-automatic segmentation to quantify intra-abdominal fat, mainly visceral adipose tissue (visceral adipose tissue (VAT)), and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)) and their corresponding fat-free tissue shares separately.  The liver MR spectra were fitted and quantified with LCModel [23], using a dedicated analysis protocol for lipid detection in the liver. The lipid signal was modeled with peaks at [0.9, 1.3, 1.6, 2.1, 2.3, 2.8, 4.1, 4.3, 5.2, 5.3] ppm by LCModel. Quantification results determined with Cramer-Rao lower bounds larger than 20% were rejected for further analysis. For determination of the intrahepatic lipid (intrahepatic lipid (IHL)) content, the fat signal (FS) was quantified as the sum of the integrated lipid peaks at 0.9, 1.3, and 1.6 ppm, while for the water signal (WS), the integrated water peak in the non-water-suppressed spectra was taken.",a6c2fca8-9d35-4986-8c60-fed0565a5ea8
6,methods6," The integrated signals were corrected with the relaxation constants reported by [24] and the intrahepatic lipid (IHL) content was calculated as intrahepatic lipid (IHL) = FS/(FS + WS). From the quantified lipid resonances, mean chain length, saturated lipid component, total unsaturated lipid component, and fraction of unsaturated lipids were determined as described by reference [25].  Data acquisition of fasting blood parameters as well as fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (fat free mass (FFM)) determined via air displacement plethysmography (air displacement plethysmography (ADP)) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)) were part of the main study and are described elsewhere [6].   2.5.",084ede9f-5468-49fe-9439-764e2deeaf24
7,methods7," Statistics Bland-Altman-diagrams were created to evaluate the agreement among bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and air displacement plethysmography (ADP) results and to allow identification of any systematic difference between baseline and follow up measurements of the same modality. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to check for distribution differences in the matched samples of PRE and POST values and asymptotic significance values (2-tailed) were calculated. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for investigating associations between variables. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 24 for statistical analysis (IBM, New York, NY, USA).  3. Results 3.1. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) All twelve subjects finished PRE and POST MR examinations a well as the corresponding air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) assessments.",457747f8-64af-42f3-8166-d8d90eeaa86b

Data of one patient had to be excluded since the patient could not follow breathing commands during the POST examination and accordingly the measured MR data were corrupted. For all subjects, fasting blood parameters as well as fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (fat free mass (FFM)) data, determined via air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) within the main study, were available.",fcc5164c-1b82-45df-ab75-7c0c507abd9f
9,methods9,"  For total body weight normalized values of Body mass index (BMI) and results derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of total subcutaneous mass, subcutaneous fat-free mass, and subcutaneous fat mass changed significantly from PRE to POST, as listed in the lower part of Table 1. This decrease went along with a decrease in body mass index for all subjects (Supplementary Figure S2). All values calculated for the total abdominal masses and internal masses did not show significant changes.  An intra-subject comparison of PRE vs. POST magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results showed a systematic decrease in total abdominal volume between the top of the femoral heads and the liver apex for each subject prior to diet and six weeks after diet initiation (Figure 2a), which accompanied an decrease in body weight for all subjects (Figure 2b).",06f3de35-a251-4ff1-a64c-27151153bfa3
10,methods10," Volume ratios of fat-free mass/total mass and fat mass/sub volume mass for the subcutaneous and the internal sub volumes are plotted in Figure 2c,d and Figure 2e,f, respectively. None of the values reached given significance levels for the differences of PRE and POST values. Total volume and the ratios of subcutaneous volume/total volume, subcutaneous fat mass volume/subcutaneous volume decreased between pre and post for all subjects. Correspondingly the ratios internal volume/total volume and subcutaneous fat-free mass volume/subcutaneous volume increased between pre and post for all subjects.   3.2. Modality Comparison For comparison, Figure 3 displays changes of fat mass (left) and fat-free mass (right) measured by air displacement plethysmography (air displacement plethysmography (ADP)), bioelectrical impedance analysis (bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)), and magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) results.",35137976-d884-4193-b0ab-897f0fe4fdd1
11,methods11," Supplementary Figure S3 shows each modality Bland-Altman-Plot comparing PRE and POST examinations. This view on an individual subject level reveals a systematic and consistent decrease of fat mass in all subjects except for one. Fat-free mass showed the same direction of changes in individual data for air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results. bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) fat-free mass results did not reveal a consistent development over all subjects. On a group level, Body mass index (BMI) and fat parameters of all three modalities decreased significantly, but there was no such uniform change regarding the fat-free parameter (Table 1).  Bland-Altman plots shown in Supplementary Figure S4 compare air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) results for fat and fat-free mass.",c877e6fa-1032-4db6-baf1-89128f9d5ff9
12,methods12," Through statistical analysis, it was found that total fat mass derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a strong correlation (p < 0.001), with the corresponding values derived from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) data with a correlation coefficient of 0.815 and from air displacement plethysmography (ADP) data with a correlation coefficient of 0.834, respectively. The same was found for total fat-free mass with correlation coefficients of 0.906 for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) vs. air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and 0.904 for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) vs. bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Correlations coefficients between bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and air displacement plethysmography (ADP) data were 0.937 for fat mass and 0.982 for fat-free mass with p < 0.001.  3.3. magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and spectroscopy (MRS) Figure 4 shows example liver spectra with the quantifiable lipid peaks.",e118a509-005f-40fd-ab21-b32cd2bc4d30
13,methods13," One subject had to be excluded from the magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and spectroscopy (MRS) analysis due to erroneous voxel positioning. The LCModel analysis could be performed for all other subjects. The intrahepatic lipid (IHL) content as well as saturated lipid component and fraction of unsaturated lipids could be determined for all spectra. The mean chain length parameter could only be quantified without accounting for the resonances L52 and L53, which could not be quantified with sufficient accuracy (Cramér–Rao lower bound CRLBs < 20%) in several subjects. The total unsaturated lipid component could not be determined in all subjects and was therefore excluded from further analysis.   None of the magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and spectroscopy (MRS) parameters showed a significant difference between PRE and POST examination.",87fd8cfc-b7d7-42b7-8429-d14f5b0db415
14,methods14," Figure 5 shows the derived mean intrahepatic lipid (intrahepatic lipid (IHL)) values for PRE and POST measurements. Changes of intrahepatic lipid (IHL) between PRE and POST examination were heterogeneous between the subjects and on a very low level were mostly below 1%, as seen in Figure 5a.  4. Discussion The primary purpose of this before-and-after comparison study was to evaluate the effects of a proven non-energy-restricted KD on body composition parameter and intrahepatic lipid content. After the 1-week transition phase, urinary ketosis was detectable on 97% (69%–100%) of the days, revealing a very good compliance to the KD [6]. While low-technology measures such as Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratios can give some indication on the locations of fat deposits in the body, they provide little knowledge about local body composition, since they are indirect measurements.",97863802-85b5-470b-a809-ba6815a88645
15,methods15," There is also uncertainty about how these measures perform across diverse ethnic groups since many earlier studies are based chiefly on Caucasian populations, and hence, it remains unclear whether derived relationships are consistent in non-Caucasian populations [26].   Magnetic resonance methods like MR-fat-water-imaging and liver spectroscopy, developed or optimized for this purpose in the context of obesity research, were employed to access such parameters on an individual level within this study. With full volume coverage and spatial resolution in the mm3-range, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for in vivo body composition measurements [27]. In addition, air displacement plethysmography and bioelectrical impedance analysis data available from the main study were compared to the MR findings.",f67a02f3-4fdb-4edf-ace9-239fefb68759
16,methods16," We found a strong correlation of fat mass as well as of fat-free mass derived from air displacement plethysmography (ADP), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), even though the basic measurement principles are quite different and there are differences in the body coverage of the methods.  bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) estimates total body water indirectly via electrical impedance measurements [28]. The subtraction from body weight leads to an estimate of body fat mass. air displacement plethysmography (ADP) measures body volume, allowing the estimation of fat and fat-free mass in combination with body weight using empirically derived equations [29]. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) directly measures the volume and type of body tissue, allowing direct calculation of body composition fractions by segmenting the data [30]. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in this study was limited to parts of the trunk, as shown in Figure 1.",4177c6c0-3c03-402d-a15c-5aed125e331a
17,methods17," Even though there are individual variations in mass distribution over various body parts, the individual mass changes from PRE to POST measured by air displacement plethysmography (ADP), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the same trend. Variations may be attributed to the fact that according to body segmentation data, the whole trunk accounts for 43% of the body mass [31], which leads to approximately 20%–25% of the whole body mass accounting for the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-examined part in this study. Changes in the remaining part of the body go unnoticed by such an abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol. However it is known that with weight loss the waist/hip ratio does not change, but the waist/thigh ratio decreases [32], since there is a relatively greater deposition of fat at the waist than on the thighs.",bb9c057b-3920-4c98-ac86-c2c3fe0769e6
18,methods18," This might be an indication that the good correlation values may be read as if changes in the rest of the body are at least not opposite to the changes in the trunk. Correlation values r < 1 can be interpreted to indicate that changes are smaller than in the trunk. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements with restricted body coverage like the used abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-protocol therefore seem to be a good estimation of the overall changes in the body. Alternatively a whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol would have to be applied [17]. This would allow exact measurements of spatially resolved fat distribution in the whole body [33]. The disadvantage is a significant longer acquisition time. Since this usually also requires covering not only the abdomen, but the whole body with surface array receiver coils, patient comfort and therefor the overall patient acceptance rate might be reduced.",5575ed06-ea1d-4746-817f-19a7c266210a
19,methods19,"  The good correspondence in the results of weight and body composition from air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in this subgroup with the findings of the main study indicates that even though the sample size was limited, it seems to be representative of the larger group of the main study. Significant losses of fat mass and, albeit to a lower extent, of fat-free mass via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) were found, while the significance levels of the losses in fat mass and in fat-free mass derived from air displacement plethysmography (ADP) data were much higher. Except for one subject on an individual level, the Bland-Altman plots revealed a consistent decrease in fat mass independent of the used method. However, the absolute values differ, which is not surprising since the examination volume and therefore the absolute covered fat mass examined was different in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).",86290898-be4b-4657-ab90-eb908277c035
20,methods20," The Bland-Altman plots also reveal that the changes for fat-free mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) are incoherent; over all subjects they varied from small decrease to small increase over the subject group. This may be attributed to the known limitations of single bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements in individual patients [15]. While bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) values are mainly influenced by body water within extremities, it is of limited use regarding the tissue composition within the abdomen. The latter can be very precisely measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [33], which is an additional benefit compared to bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) examinations.  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is in agreement with these findings showing significant losses in fat mass but not in fat-free mass.",5217ac42-7bbd-4018-8ecb-05698e7d94e3
21,methods21," In addition to this, the possibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate the localization of the tissue by segmentation into various compartments or even into muscles and organs allows a more detailed view [34]. In the analysis of this study, segmentation into the two compartments of subcutaneous and internal tissue was done. This reveals that the overall losses in fat-mass are mainly attributed to losses in the subcutaneous fat mass and only to a small extent to changes in internal fat mass. Changes in fat-free mass are not observable for internal tissue. This also shows that the overall losses in abdominal mass leading to reduced body weight is to a large extent a result of the losses in subcutaneous fat mass.",2fa24000-47a8-4a50-a291-93a8a0060175
22,methods22,"   The found mild weight loss over the entire 6-week KD period is consistent with non-energy-restricted KD studies, although one study suggested that body fat loss slowed on transition to KD [5,7,9,10,35] possibly because of augmented utilization of body protein. The seemingly discrepancy to the finding of unchanged mean energy intake is discussed in more detail in the main study [6]. The main study showed that a non-energy-restricted KD leads to a significant but mild weight loss over the entire 6-week KD period, although mean energy intake did not change [6,36]. Even if the diet was supposedly not energy restricted, no measurements of energy expenditure or strict dietary compliance was documented and a slight reduction in energy intake could be possible. The KD predominantly impaired the endurance capacity but not the performance in the sub maximum area so that activities of daily living and training in the aerobic zone would not be impaired.",a0d0fb42-0900-48fd-b50c-5e08a448e7fd
23,methods23," The air displacement plethysmography (ADP) measurement, which is based on the same principles as the gold standard method of hydrostatic weighing [14], revealed that weight loss consisted in equal parts of reductions in fat and fat-free mass, which is consistent with the results of the present subgroup analysis. In this study, intrahepatic lipid content was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and spectroscopy (MRS). intrahepatic lipid (IHL) values were lower than reported in other studies investigating healthy subjects [37,38], however the Body mass index (BMI) of their subjects were higher compared to our group. Therefor one factor might be the resulting selection of subjects, which included mostly lean and athletic women. Investigating a group of males with similar small Body mass index (BMI)s, Moller et al. [39] found similarly small intrahepatic lipid (IHL) values. While van Herpen et al.",71a2950f-e7a7-4a77-816f-b3789ca432e5
24,methods24," [38] found an 17% intrahepatic lipid (IHL) increase after a three week high-fat diet we could not observe significant changes of intrahepatic lipid (IHL) after 6 weeks of KD in healthy subjects. The intrahepatic lipid (IHL) values were below 3% in all and below 1% in 7 of 11 subjects. Even though the average change in body weight was >2kg, the calculated intrahepatic lipid (IHL) changes between PRE and POST examinations were even smaller and heterogeneous across subjects. Within the accuracy achievable with the given setup, there are no significant changes in intrahepatic lipid (IHL) between PRE and POST examinations.   In the literature, it has been reported that a diet rich in saturated fats can increase both liver fat and insulin resistance [40] in patients. With different dietary approaches, the intrahepatic lipid content not only may be reduced but furthermore intrahepatic lipid quality may be specifically modulated [18] in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients.",8de5c0ab-b02d-4461-9aac-595744cb1342
25,methods25," However, the clinical consequences of such interventions have to be investigated in further studies. In this study, changes in the fat deposits of the liver by a ketogenic diet in healthy humans could not be detected.  Body cell mass as a compartment of fat-free mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was unaffected, which represents the protein-rich and metabolically-active compartment [41]. Together with a rise in hand grip strength as a surrogate marker of total muscle mass and function, the main study concluded that the KD intervention affected neither muscle mass nor muscle function negatively.  Based on these combined results, including physical fitness of the main study, the conclusion that there was no negative impact neither on muscle mass nor on muscle function, and only a mild/slight negative impact on physical performance by the intervention does match with this more detailed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.",f336b432-f4e1-4833-b867-562a43e5e16c
26,methods26," The body composition changes may be regarded as positive. However, the main study lacked the possibility for interpreting the fat mass loss regarding health implications, due to the indirect nature of the applied methods used to measure total body fat mass. Fat mass, a loose connective tissue composed mostly of adipocytes, can be subdivided into several compartments regarding its location: beneath the skin (subcutaneous fat), around internal organs (visceral fat), in bone marrow, intermuscular, and in the breast tissue. Fat mass is recognized as a hormonally active tissue that is able to produce hormones such as leptin, estrogen, resistin, and the cytokine TNF-alpha [42]. We found a significant median abdominal fat mass loss of 0.8 kg through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) usage, whereby the major part of it was subcutaneous fat (75%) and the remained loss affected the internal/visceral fat.",01f14b7d-3953-4c23-88da-19b84dd3aec6
27,methods27,"  Both fat compartments have different health implications, where excess visceral fat is associated with type 2 diabetes [43], insulin resistance [44], inflammatory diseases [45], and other obesity-related diseases [46]. Hence, from a clinical perspective, preferential loss of visceral fat may be metabolically advantageous [47]. Interestingly, the fat mass loss during the KD intervention led mostly to a decrease in subcutaneous fat, which is not related to many of the classic obesity-related pathologies [48]. Especially notable is the fact that a non-energy-restricted KD without any changes in physical activity resulted in losses of abdominal subcutaneous and intraabdominal fat mass.  Magnetic resonance spectroscopy results were unexpectedly of limited use. The aim to use additional information to characterize the hepatic fat composition was only partly achieved.",3ce0dc6d-9a57-425e-9452-cb67cc68643c
28,methods28," As shown in Figure 4, magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and spectroscopy (MRS) was able to distinguish 6 to 10 hepatic fat components. However, except for the main contribution of L13, the other components often were very low and therefore their estimation subject to increased uncertainty. In the next step, this uncertainty prevented reliable detection of any possible changes. Subjects in other studies using magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and spectroscopy (MRS) to monitor liver fat properties mostly were obese and only the main or overall fat component was quantified instead of individual fat components [49]. Retrospectively analyzed, the volunteer cohort was biased toward athletic, nutrition-conscious, mainly women of normal weight levels, with lifestyles dependent on low liver fat values.",6601b867-fa6e-48b0-9338-8161d47c2327
29,methods29," The signal-to-noise ratio of the investigated group therefore was much lower compared to other groups measured with a very similar protocol before [50]. For reliable measurement of such low hepatic lipid levels, one would have to increase measurement time or voxel size or both. The former is limited by patient compliance and the latter by size and structure of the liver.   5. Conclusions In summary, our results demonstrated that magnetic resonance imaging provides body composition information on the abdominal fat distribution changes during a ketogenic diet. This information is complementary to anthropomorphic and laboratory measures and it is more detailed than measures from air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). It was shown that there was no significant change in internal fat distribution as well as in intrahepatic lipid content.",56189cbb-e6c1-4ce0-ba3f-b56034499ec6
30,methods30," However, a systematic decrease in subcutaneous masses which translates into a decrease in total mass equaling to moderate body weight reduction was found. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy however was of limited use in the investigated cohort, which might require a modified magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and spectroscopy (MRS) acquisition protocol for reliable detection of small lipid components. This might be different in more adipose subjects with higher lipid levels in the liver. ",19989e18-b432-43b7-a3fe-cb77249941aa
