0,background0,"Glioblastoma multiforme (glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)) is the most common and malignant of the primary adult brain cancers (1–4). Although survival is better in younger adults (<50 years) than in older adults (>50 years), less than 20% of younger adults generally survive beyond 24 months (3, 5–7). Accumulating evidence from cell culture studies and preclinical models indicate that glucose and glutamine are the primary fuels that drive the rapid growth of most tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (8–11). Glucose drives tumor growth through aerobic fermentation (Warburg effect), while glutamine drives tumor growth through glutaminolysis (11–15). The fermentation waste products of these molecules, i.e., lactic acid and succinic acid, respectively, acidify the tumor microenvironment thus contributing further to tumor progression (16–18).",175d0077-e938-4954-bad2-8c39e600a332
1,background1," Glucose and glutamine metabolism is also responsible for the high antioxidant capacity of the tumor cells thus making them resistant to chemo- and radiotherapies (10, 19). The reliance on glucose and glutamine for tumor cell malignancy comes largely from the documented defects in the number, structure, and function of mitochondria and mitochondrial-associated membranes (10, 20–27). These abnormalities cause the neoplastic glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells to rely more heavily on substrate level phosphorylation than on oxidative phosphorylation for energy (28). Hence, the effective management of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) will require restricted availability of glucose and glutamine.  The current standard of care (standard of care (SOC)) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) involves surgical resection and radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (temozolomide (TMZ)) (3).",f49e710c-3fd8-4640-b7e8-40bb81a4c52b
2,background2," High dose steroid (dexamethasone) is often prescribed along with the standard of care (SOC) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) to reduce vasogenic edema (29–31). It is now recognized that surgical resection and radiotherapy produce significant necrosis and hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment (4, 32). These disturbances disrupt the tightly regulated glutamine–glutamate cycle in the neural parenchyma thus increasing the levels of glutamine and also glutamate, an excitotoxic amino acid that enhances glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) invasion (33–37). Although temozolomide (TMZ) increases progression free survival, it has only marginal effect on overall survival and actually increases the number of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) driver mutations (3, 38). Moreover, dexamethasone not only increases blood glucose levels but also increases glutamine levels through its induction of glutamine synthetase activity (30, 34, 39, 40).",3e53a06b-a641-4950-ac5f-6bafd51162f7
3,background3," The anti-angiogenic drug bevacizumab, which exacerbates radiation-induced necrosis and selects for the most invasive tumor cells, is also widely prescribed to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients (35). Viewed collectively, these observations may help explain why overall survival remains poor for most glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients.  Ketogenic metabolic therapy (ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT)) is emerging as a viable complimentary or alternative therapeutic strategy for the management of malignant gliomas (35, 41–44). Calorie restriction and low-carbohydrate high-fat ketogenic diets (KD) reduce the glucose needed to drive the Warburg effect while also elevating ketone bodies that cannot be effectively metabolized for energy in tumor cells due to defects in mitochondrial structure and function (23, 27, 42, 45–50).",d2906556-3d9f-4264-9ae3-1681cb601bd2
4,background4," Calorie restriction and restricted KD are anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-invasive, and also kill tumor cells through a proapoptotic mechanism (46, 51–54). Evidence also shows that therapeutic ketosis can act synergistically with several drugs and procedures to enhance cancer management improving both progression free and overall survival (10, 43, 55, 56). For example, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)) increases oxidative stress on tumor cells especially when used alongside therapies that reduce blood glucose and raise blood ketones (57). Chloroquine inhibition of lysosomal pH can prevent invasive and metastatic tumor cells from obtaining glucose and glutamine through phagocytosis or autophagy (10, 58). The glutamine dehydrogenase inhibitor, epigallocatechin gallate (epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)) is also proposed to target glutamine metabolism (59).",42d14c78-89c6-45e8-bb69-7577900683cc

Laboratory investigation revealed unremarkable blood chemistry, with liver and renal functions within normal limits (Table 1). Blood homocysteine level was elevated, while blood lipid analysis showed hypercholesterolemia and hypobetalipoproteinemia with mildly elevated levels of triglycerides (Table 1). Fasting blood glucose was normal, but fasting insulin level was elevated suggesting some degree of insulin resistance. The patient’s level of circulating 25(OH)D3 was low (3.1 ng/dL). The patient was heterozygous for mutations (c677t and a1298c) in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)) gene suggesting a folate deficiency.

The patient’s caloric intake at diagnosis was approximately 2,200–2,500 kcal/day (estimated from a 3-day food record and a 24-h diet recall). The patient underwent a 72 h water-only fast immediately after preliminary diagnosis and before any medical or surgical treatment (Figure 1A).",b1a85815-62c4-446b-a77c-47acfdf0777a
10,background11," Consumption of a calorie restricted ketogenic diet (KD-R) for 23 days followed the fast. The patient’s biomarker profile before and after fasting and KD-R is shown in Table 1. Measurements of glucose, ketones, and insulin were taken at the laboratory in the morning. Urine ketones were scored as +, ++, and +++ corresponding to median capillary blood ketone levels of 0.5 mmol/L [interquartile range (IQR): 0.1–0.9], 0.7 mmol/L (IQR: 0.2–1.8), and 3 mmol/L (IQR: 1.4–5.2), respectively.

The KD-R was supplemented with B-complex vitamins, minerals, calcium, magnesium, and omega 3 fatty acids to maintain nutrient adequacy and normal blood chemistry. Vitamin D3 was prescribed (5,000 IU/day) to correct the patient’s vitamin D deficiency. Other additions included metformin (1,000 mg/day) and methylfoliate (1,000 mg/day) to overcome methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) enzymatic blockage, to correct DNA hypomethylation, and to help decrease homocysteine accumulation.",fc5d10dd-4f07-44a9-8b88-540e27b38f6d
12,background13," The patient received levetiracetam (1,500 mg/day) to control seizure activity. Immediate preoperative laboratory investigation revealed correction of the previous vitamin D deficiency, a return of homocysteine and triglycerides to normal levels, and correction of hypercholesterolemia and hypobetalipoproteinemia (Table 1). The patient’s glucose-ketone index (glucose ketone index (GKI)), a calculation that tracks the ratio of blood glucose to ketones as a single value, remained in the predicted therapeutic range (Figure 1B) (60). No steroids (dexamethasone), phenytoin, or sugar-based osmatic diuretics (mannitol) were given to the patient.  After 21 days following initiation of the KD-R, the patient underwent an awake craniotomy with subtotal tumor resection (March 2016). The suspected diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) was confirmed by histopathology of tumor tissue.",3d48c152-cca4-4c56-a08d-064506d78e78
13,background14," Regressive and regenerative changes not typical of untreated glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were noted, possibly reflecting a favorable response to preoperative ketogenic therapy (Figure 3A). Haematoxylin and eosin histological analysis revealed the classical patterns of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Figure 3A). The tumor was composed of a heterogeneous mixture of cells having pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei and variable amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm set in a fibrillary background. Gemistocytic cells (<20%) were focally admixed. Focal epithelioid and clear cell features were also noted. Numerous mitotic figures, vascular proliferation, areas of necrosis (constituting 50% of the tumor), and focal pseudopalisading necrosis were seen.",6a3a26c0-016c-4d4e-8dd4-06f6be564ed4
14,background15," It is noteworthy that less aggressive forms of vascular proliferation and mitosis (namely, glomeruloid vascular proliferation and granular mitoses, respectively) were noted together with the more ominous type of vascular proliferation and irregular mitoses (3/10HPF), more typically associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Figure 3A). Also noted was limited infiltration of tumor cells into the surrounding parenchyma. Thick-walled hyalinized blood vessels, often seen in lower grade tumors, were also notable given that this patient had not yet received standard of care (SOC). Granulation tissue formation and proliferating fibroblasts (organized around areas of necrosis) was another feature not usually present in untreated glioblastomas and suggested a favorable response to preoperative ketogenic therapy.",944ca1b9-6dce-4f3c-af1b-5333ffcce9c1

The patient’s postoperative recovery was excellent with no signs of previous left weakness or seizures. The patient’s blood glucose level was 64 mg/dL and his urine ketone level was +++, producing an approximate glucose ketone index (GKI) of 1.3. There was no intraoperative or postoperative increase in blood pH assessed by five arterial blood gas measures taken at consecutive hours. The patient was discharged to home 2 days after surgery. The R-KD was continued together with 14 h daily fasting between dinner and breakfast.

17,background18," Two weeks postoperative, the patient began receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) (2.5 ATA for 60 min, 5 times/week). The baseline serum lactate/pyruvate ratio (L/P ratio) test showed an increased lactate ratio indicative of an abnormal oxidation-reduction state.  Enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)) evaluated 3 months postoperative and before radiation or chemotherapy revealed a stationary course of disease regarding tumor size that persisted to 12 months (Figures 2B,C). The choline creatine ratio on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) indicated significant reduction in tumor metabolism (Figure 4A). The patient was neurologically intact and free of clinical seizure activity using only levetiracetam (1,500 mg/day) and KD. Fasting glucose was 60–70 mg/dL with ++ to +++ urine ketone levels and producing approximate glucose ketone index (GKI) value of 1.8.",109f2218-f447-406a-bc38-570105253b61
18,background19," Circulating insulin was low (approximately 4 IU) compared with the initial assessment (13 IU). The patient’s body weight was 67.7 kg with a BMI of 23.7. Radiotherapy with oral temozolomide (TMZ) (75 mg/m2 orally once a day for 42 days) was initiated 18 h after water-only fasting (no food was consumed for up to 8 h following RT and temozolomide (TMZ)). The patient also received 20 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) (2.5 ATA, 5 days/week, for 60 min/session). The L/P ratio, known to be elevated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, was measured every week and sessions were repeated whenever L/P ratio increased (61). hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) was also used to help lower the L/P ratio within normal limits (62, 63). The L/P ratio is also a good serum indicator for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) effectiveness on tumor oxygenation, glucose metabolism, and tumor redox state.

22,discussion0,"In this case report, we describe a favorable therapeutic response to ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) and other treatments targeting metabolism in a 38-year-old man with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and metabolic imbalances. ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) is a nutritional anti-neoplastic intervention involving ketogenic or low-glycemic diets for managing malignant gliomas (42). The standard of care (SOC) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) was modified in this patient to initiate ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) prior to surgical resection, to eliminate steroid medication, and to include hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as part of the therapy. Specific drugs and dietary supplements were also used in the therapy. Previous studies showed that a KD is well tolerated for most glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, but therapeutic efficacy can vary among patients perhaps due to differences in the degree of calorie restriction (42, 64–69).",ef56b541-4917-4964-a199-81599ade873e
23,discussion1," Few of the adult glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients treated with KDs in these studies were able to reach or maintain the glucose ketone index (GKI) predicted to have the greatest therapeutic benefit for patients (near 1.0) (60). However, an excellent therapeutic response to the KD was seen in two children with high-grade gliomas (70). When compared to baseline, blood glucose levels were lower and blood ketone levels were higher in both children at 8 weeks, with the glucose and ketone values in the theoretical therapeutic zone (60). The observed reduction in blood glucose in our patient would reduce lactic acid fermentation in the tumor cells, while the elevation of ketone bodies would fuel normal cells thus protecting them from hypoglycemia and oxidative stress (10).  Previous studies showed that glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) survival and tumor growth was correlated with blood glucose levels, i.e.",50164407-d2de-450a-bf17-e368052854a8
24,discussion2,", the higher was the blood glucose, the shorter was the survival, and the faster was the tumor growth (31, 40, 71–76). As the dexamethasone steroid is often prescribed together with the standard of care (SOC) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (31, 40), the elimination of this steroid treatment could have contributed in part to the reduced glucose levels and favorable outcome observed in our patient. Evidence indicates that glioma cells cannot effectively use ketone bodies for energy due to defects in the number, structure, and function of their mitochondria (10, 23, 27, 42, 45–50, 77). The accuracy of the glucose ketone index (GKI) as a predictor for therapeutic efficacy, however, is better when ketone bodies are measured from the blood than when measured from the urine (10).",c1ca8743-c3ec-4166-a9cb-08450a59accb
25,discussion3," Nevertheless, the low glucose ketone index (GKI) values observed in our patient following ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) was in the direction of predicted therapeutic success for reducing lactic acid fermentation (41, 60). A reduction of glucose-driven lactic acid fermentation would not only increase tumor cell apoptosis, but would also reduce inflammation and edema in the tumor microenvironment thus reducing tumor cell angiogenesis and invasion (51, 52, 54, 78, 79).  Although ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) is effective in targeting the Warburg effect in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells it would be less effective in targeting glutamine, the other major fuel that drives glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) growth (8, 10, 14, 42). Besides serving as a metabolic fuel for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), glutamine is also an essential metabolite for normal immune cells (10, 80).",a5fb88f6-7519-4d78-bbbf-4a5b28d5d477
26,discussion4," Macrophages in particular are needed to repair the microenvironment and to remove dead tumor cells following metabolic therapy (10). Therefore, therapies that inhibit glutamine availability and utilization must be strategically employed to avoid inadvertent impairment of immune cell functions. It can be difficult to restrict glutamine without also impairing important functions of normal immune cells. Consequently, we used the non-toxic green tea extract, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and chloroquine in an attempt to limit glutamine availability to the tumor cells. epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is thought to target the glutamate dehydrogenase activity that facilitates glutamine metabolism in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells (59, 81). Chloroquine, on the other hand, will inhibit lysosomal digestion thus restricting fermentable amino acids and carbohydrates from phagocytosed materials in the tumor microenvironment (10, 82).",3119b747-7359-4d5e-a399-9941b05056e2
27,discussion5," We also treated the patient with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to increase oxidative stress in the tumor cells (10, 57). We originally described how somatic mutations could make tumor cells more vulnerable to physiological stress than normal cells based on the evolutionary concepts of Potts (83, 84). As glucose and glutamine fermentation protect tumor cells from oxidative stress, reduced availability of these metabolites under ketosis could enhance the therapeutic action of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), as we recently described (10). The observed reductions in the L/P and choline/creatine ratios coupled with increased N acetylaspartate (NAA) are consistent with research suggesting that metabolic management may improve survival (85, 86). We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that our patient’s tumor contained certain genes (IDH1 mutation, ATRX and 1p/19q deletion) that might have also contributed to his favorable response.",4c20f5fd-b2a6-4507-931e-1a38a29a4b80
28,discussion6, More detailed studies in other glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients surviving to 24 months would be needed to test this hypothesis. We suggest that the targeting of glucose and glutamine in a press-pulse therapeutic strategy together with a modified standard of care (SOC) could have contributed to the favorable outcome in this glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patient despite evidence of postoperative residual tumor.  Concluding Remarks Glioblastoma multiforme remains among the most aggressive and difficult to manage primary tumors of the central nervous system. Emerging evidence indicates that cancer is primarily a mitochondrial metabolic disease where tumor cells become dependent on fermentation for growth. Glucose and glutamine are the prime fermentable fuels that drive glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell growth and invasion.,5524e817-5995-4d8d-a2d4-f2da587f4707
29,discussion7," A press-pulse therapeutic strategy was implemented to target glucose and glutamine availability in a 38-year-old glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patient using a modified standard of care (SOC) and ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT). As less than 20% of younger adults generally survive beyond 24 months with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), it is possible that the response observed in this case resulted in part from ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) and the modified standard of care (SOC). The patient is now 40 years old and remains in excellent health with no noticeable neurological issues (Karnofsky Score, 100%) after 24 months of treatment.
