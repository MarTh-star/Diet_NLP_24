0,background0," Recent research suggest that gut microbiome may play a fundamental role in athlete's health and performance. Interestingly, nutrition can affect athletic performance by influencing the gut microbiome composition. Among different dietary patterns, ketogenic diet represents an efficient nutritional approach to get adequate body composition in athletes, however, some concerns have been raised about its potential detrimental effect on gut microbiome. To the best of our knowledge, only one study investigated the effect of ketogenic diet on the gut microbiome in athletes (elite race walkers), whilst no studies are available in a model of mixed endurance/power sport such as soccer. This study aimed to investigate the influence of a ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY)) diet on gut microbiome composition in a cohort of semi-professional soccer players.

1,methods0," 16 male soccer players were randomly assigned to ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet (ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet (KDP) n = 8) or western diet (WD n = 8). Body composition, performance measurements and gut microbiome composition were measured before and after 30 days of intervention by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Alpha-diversity measures and Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) was used to investigate pre-post differences in the relative abundance of all taxonomic levels (from phylum to genus) and Spearman's correlations was used to investigate associations between microbial composition and macronutrient intake. Linear discriminant analysis was also performed at the different taxonomic levels on the post-intervention data.   Participants  This is a secondary analysis of a previous published research (13).  A more detailed description of the experimental study and physiological measures can be found (13).",ef7c7f3f-8d8d-47e1-9741-deefd5354e51
2,methods1," Sixteen semi-professional soccer players (25.5 ± 2.8 years, 77.2 ± 11.88 kg) were recruited for the study. The exclusion criteria were: participants with a body fat percentage over 32%, (determined via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry DXA), cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, thyroid or any other metabolic diseases, weight change ± 2 Kg over the last month, adherence to special diets, use of nutritional supplements (except a daily multivitamin-mineral), use of antibiotics (17), use of medication to control blood lipids or glucose. The anthropometric details of the subjects enrolled in the study were provided in our previous published study (13).  During the study players were asked to keep their normal training schedule (8 h of training/week).",71ee3969-8180-47d7-8abb-62442ed74e58

The workload of all athletes was over-imposable because the coach and trainers strictly controlled the training schedule, and they were instructed to maintain the same level of physical activity throughout the study (The study protocol is shown in detail in our previous article, Figure 1).  Figure 1 Detailed list of food provided.  Dietary intervention  Before the start of the study, athletes were provided nutritional counseling and resources to better adhere to ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY).",f60a2086-bf07-4cda-8cdd-ad5a70f15796

6,methods5," Moreover, since the nutritional protocol of KD it may be hard to be maintained for long periods due to the lack of sweet taste (19), many ready-to-eat ketogenic products (ready to eat ketogenic products (RKP)) have been provided in addition to usual low carbohydrate foods (20). The present study indeed tested some ready-to-eat foods selected from the product range of Tisanoreica® snacks and meals (Gianluca Mech S.p.A., Asigliano Veneto, Vicenza, Italy) and Le Gamberi Food® and meals.  In our protocol we used some ready to eat ketogenic products (RKP) as a ketogenic pasta (selected with a ketogenic ratio of fats: protein+carbohydrate equal to 4:1) (Le Gamberi Foods, Forlì, Italy), and other ready to eat ketogenic products (RKP) (specialty meals and drinks) that mimics the taste of carbohydrates, constituted principally of high-quality protein (18 g of protein per portion), fibers, and electrolytes (mainly magnesium and potassium) (Tisanoreica® by Gianluca Mech S.p.A.",a46f0f88-2cfb-4080-9b5b-16bcfab39e94

Both diets were designed to be isoproteic i.e., same amount of protein (1.8 g × Kg−1 × body weight−1 × day −1). The distribution of macronutrients during the ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) was carbohydrate (< 30 g × day−1; < 10%) protein 1.8g × Kg−1 × body weight−1 × day −1 (~25–30%), fats ad libitum. Moreover, each subject was provided of three herbal extracts [Table 1, Antonio Paoli et al.

9,methods8,"  During the first week, subjects were provided of pure medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT oil: 20 g Named® Natural Medicine), in order to facilitate ketosis (21) and to allow players maintaining the same work load during training sessions. WD group was provided of a diet similar to western diet, thus the intake of protein has been increased to 1.8 g × Kg−1 × body weight−1 × day−1 in order to be make the two diets isoproteic. The WD was composed mainly of whole cereals (spelt, rye, oat) and pseudo-cereals (buckwheat, quinoa, amaranth), whole grain pasta, potatoes, meet, fish, vegetables, fruit, legumes, olive oil, milk, and red wine (at most 1 glass per day). Thus, the WD ensured a constant energy and macronutrient balance: protein 1.8 g × Kg−1 × body weight−1 × day−1, (~ 30%), fats ~20–25% and carbohydrate ~50–55%. WD diet was also designed to contain < 10% saturated fat and < 300 mg cholesterol/day.",a4037c36-3d89-4762-a490-1dd9e42b5b0c
10,methods9,"  It should be stressed that, as it can be noted, the WD diet we provided to the athletes was totally different from the typical high-fat, high sucrose Western diet usually adopted in research studies.  In both groups protein intake was distributed equally throughout the day (every 3–4 h) and pre-sleep casein protein intake (30–40 g) was provided in both group after training evening session, as indicated by the ISSN's position stand (22). The diets were explained to all subjects during an individual visit and dietary intake was measured by validated 3-food-diary that has been used in the past in studies with athletes (23) and analyzed by Nutritionist Pro™ (AxxyA systems, Arlington, VA).  Subjects received the specific instruction for completing detailed weighed food records during 7 day-periods for each diet and were daily monitored by call interviews each day after dinner.",7cc99df6-8f51-4a25-b27e-0c6f05bc81d9
11,methods10," To ensure that carbohydrates were restricted throughout the ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet, subjects tested their urine daily using reagent strips at the same time of the day (Ketostix semiquantitative urine strips, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), recording the result on log sheet and, once or twice a week, subjects were tested by GlucoMen LX Plus (Menarini Diagnostics, Firenze, Italy) to detect ketones concentration in capillary blood. Subjects received follow-up counseling and dietetic education if necessary. Additionally, a WhatsApp (Meta Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) group was created and some applications for smartphone were provided (Keto-diet tracker, https://ke.to/; Keto-app, https://ketodietapp.com/), to track their food daily intake.

14,methods13," The bioinformatic analysis was performed by means QIIME 2 2021.4 version (24). Raw reads were firstly trimmed applying Cutadapt to remove residual primer sequences and then processed with DADA2 plug-in (25) to perform the denoising step. DADA2 was run with default parameters except for the truncation length: forward and reverse reads were truncated at 260 and 245 nucleotides, respectively. The resulting Amplicon Sequence Variant (Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV)) sequences were filtered out by applying a 0.01% frequency threshold in order to discard singletons and very rare sequences.

17,analysis1," A dissimilarity matrix with Bray-Curtis distance was calculated, and a Permutational Analysis of Variance (Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA)) for repeated measures was used to test pre-post differences between the two groups (ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet (KDP) vs. WD) in the relative abundances at phylum and genera taxonomic levels, using the adonis R function, and post-hoc comparisons were performed with a paired Wilcoxon test with false discover rate (FDR) correction. Furthermore, after ruling out baseline differences in the microbial composition at baseline, data were filtered for the presence of each taxon in at least 70% of the subjects, and a linear discriminant analysis (linear discriminant analysis (LDA)) was performed at the different taxonomic levels (from phylum to genus) on the post-intervention data (LEfSe; linear discriminant analysis (LDA) Score >2.0, p < 0.",6069f705-b04a-4ff4-b124-ec39d9732e24

Subjects adhered to the given instructions for both diet interventions according to analysis of diets records (3 days food-diary before the study and 7 days food-diary during the study). During the diet interventions, all dietary nutrients were significantly different between the ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) and WD diets. Indeed, the intake of CHO g/day and % in ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) and WD group was, respectively (ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet (KDP) = 22 ± 5 g/day; WD = 220 ± 56 g/day, p < 0.0001), (ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet (KDP) = 9 ± 3 %; WD = 51 ± %, p < 0.0001) while the intake of % fat was (ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet (KDP) = 64 ± 3%; WD = 20 ± 8 %; p < 0.0001).",6197cc27-8b47-4935-98ba-218663ff1978

28,discussion0," The human gut microbiome is well recognized to be implicated in the promotion-maintenance of health as well in some disease states (27).  Given its plasticity, the gut microbial community can be affected by several factors including genetics, nutrition, environment, exercise and exposure to antibiotics; however, among these contributors, diet elicits the predominant influencing factor (28). To date, while only one study investigated the effect of ketogenic diet in sport's performance and gut microbiome in endurance discipline (16), no data are available about the effect of ketogenic diet on gut microbiome composition and athlete's performance in team sport.",5e4115f8-ae4b-4a2f-b322-0305776dab4d
29,discussion1,"  In this study we demonstrate that 30 days of ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) did not affect the overall gut microbiome of athletes in terms of alpha- diversity indices (the total number of species and the Shannon's Effective Number of Species); however, both groups presented a significant variation both at phylum and genus levels composition (Figure 1).  Indeed, the phylum of Actinobacteria was significantly decreased in the ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) and increased in the WD group (Figure 3), while Clostridia UCG-014, Butyricimonas, Odoribacterter and Ruminococcus genera were significantly increased after ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet (KDP) intervention (Figure 4).",c5b0b32b-49a6-4aae-8b6d-da2fa51d03fc
30,discussion2,"  Although our data are in contrast with previous studies identifying a positive association between “high fat diet” and impairment on gut microbiome (14, 34, 35), our results are not surprising since the previous studies investigated the effect of a high-fat, high sugar, Western diet on gut microbiome and did not investigate the effect of ketogenic diet (14, 34, 36) that represent a unique, specific dietary pattern.  In addition, many studies (29–32) investigating the effect of a high-fat diet on gut microbiome tested only mouse models fed a refined high-fat, low fiber diet with animals fed a standard chow diet, high in soluble fibers. For this reason, the conclusions arising from animal studies cannot be adopted to predict the outcomes of a ketogenic diet and, consequently, its associated effect on human gut microbiome (33).  As a matter of fact, in humans, Turnbaugh et al.",109ccd4d-c8ee-42cb-ad8b-706255eccac2
31,discussion3," recently confirmed (34) that ketogenic diets differentially alter the composition of gut microbiome when compared to high-fat diet and, further, the authors showed that only ketogenic diet was able to provide positive gut-associated systemic outcomes (34).  Moreover, another explanation for the maintenance of microbial diversity after ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) intervention may rely on the specific composition of our ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet. Indeed, when investigating the effect of a ketogenic diet on gut microbiome and health parameters, it should be considered not only the amount of fat (i.e., 70–80% fat from total daily calories), but also the different type and quality of fats. Different types of fat are associated with different effects on the gut microbiome and, consequently, with different effects on intestinal and systemic health (35–37).",f6e4a13e-e978-44bb-8213-971f82ec0e98
32,discussion4," If on one side saturated fats are associated with decreased microbiome diversity (14) in humans, polyunsaturated fat such as omega-3 did not affect microbial diversity and richness. Polyunsaturated fats have the capacity to improve gut epithelial integrity and gastrointestinal health through their ability to produce SCFAs (38). In our study, the ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet was highly composed in mono-polyunsaturated fat (49 ± 16 g and 21 ± 5 g, respectively) differently from the WD diet which was lower (9 ± 5 g and 5 ± 2, respectively) (13). We hypothesized that sources of omega-3 fatty acids may have act synergically with ketone bodies to promote an anti-inflammatory state (39), also influencing the intestinal microbiome by increasing the production of SCFAs (37). However, further studies investingating the hypothesized mechanisms are warranted.  Of note, more recently, Furber et al.",53e979f4-ffe7-484a-8652-c6bae88a6915
33,discussion5," (40) investigated the relationships between gut microbial communities and athletic performance in a cohort of highly trained individuals underwent dietary periodization (high-carbs vs. high-protein diet). Interestingly, apart from the taxonomic differences between two dietary interventions, the authors revealed that that better athletic performance was linked with gut microbial stasis, where athletes harboring stable microbial communities consistently performed best in each dietary intervention compared to those with a more turbulent gut microbiome.  This result brings to light a pivotal concept: the maintenance of a stable gut microbiome during dietary intervention represents a marker for gut-health and athletic performance (40).  Differences at phylum level  At phylum level, the decrease in Actinobacteria relative abundance could mainly be attributed to a decrease of the relative abundance of the genus Bifidobacterium (Figure 3).",2edd885c-0127-40a7-b76a-bbac94a74a80
34,discussion6,"  Bifidobacteria are common to the healthy human gastrointestinal tract and represent one of the first colonizers of the mammalian gut. Bifidobacteria metabolize complex carbohydrates given that the genome of these bacteria harbors many genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism (41, 42). The metagenome includes a variety of genes encoding for a specific hexose fermentation pathway, the fructose-6-phosphate (43), which represent the principal pathway for the energy output produced, compared to classical pathways used by other fermentative intestinal bacteria. Indeed, it provides a growth advantage for bifidobacteria in the presence of complex carbohydrates (43). These facts may explain the concomitant proportional decrease of bifidobacteria and genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism during ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) intervention. Accordingly to the reduction in Bifidobacterium genus, Turnbaugh et al.",443977ed-382b-43ba-8797-79cc55131d95
35,discussion7," (34) recently demonstrated in a cohort of over-weight humans that the drop in bifidobacterial genera was correlated with the increase of ketone bodies and positively associated with a decreased intestinal Th17 cell levels and adipose tissues. Given the links between obesity and chronic low-grade inflammation (44), the authors suggested that decreased levels of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells in both gut and adipose tissues during ketogenic diet may be a potential mechanism contributing to the greater efficacy of ketogenic diet in improving some aspects of metabolic syndrome such as glycemic control (45) and reduction in body fat (46).",47b7dde6-9a71-48b5-9295-3faad523359e
36,discussion8,"  A decline in bifidobacteria has been also observed in weight loss intervention on a macro nutritionally balanced diet, gluten-free diet and low-gluten intervention diet (47, 48), thus, the reduction of Bifidobacterium abundance after ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) intervention may be also attributed to the low intake of cereal grains.  On the other side, the higher abundance of Actinobacteria phylum after WD intervention may be, at least in part, the consequences of the different amount of fibers given that the intake of fibers decreased in the ketogenic diet (from 13 to 11 g per day) while increased in WD diet (from 11 to 15 g per day), which could be a strong driver of Actinobacteria abundance (49).",b342efb0-0963-4c8c-b41d-eb7d095a8174
37,discussion9,"  Finally, at phylum level, our analysis also revealed that ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) intervention altered the composition of the gut microbiome by increasing Bacteroidetes and lowering the Firmicutes phylum (decreased F:B ratio), compared to WD controls. Even though the F/B ratio is outdated (50), many studies (51–54) have reported that the balance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes may represent an important biomarker for obesity and an indicator of health. More specifically, an increased F:B ratio is commonly associated with dysbiosis, obesity and negative metabolic outcomes (55). These findings are in line with our results since athletes following ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) underwent a significant reduction in body weight, body fat mass, waist circumference and visceral adipose tissues (13).",0c583453-10be-4b91-9259-cc8c6fcb01d8
38,discussion10," Moreover, it is well known that an excess of adipose tissue (and particularly visceral adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue (VAT)) is related to inflammation (56). In our study, both groups lost body weight, but ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) group showed a greater reduction of fat mass and visceral adipose tissue (VAT).  Differences and genus level  At genus level, we observed an increased in Butyricimonas, Clostridia UCG_14, Odoribacter and Ruminococcus. Enrichment of Butyricimonas negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and triglyceride levels indicates that these taxa may promote health or contribute to the prevention of obesity (57, 58). Our results may support this idea because these taxa increased after ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) intervention.",45ca5ef4-57ec-43d8-b3d7-c0bfa4fda6a1
39,discussion11," Moreover, a high abundance of butyric-acid-producing such as Butyricimonas has been associated with normal weight and diets high in animal protein and saturated fats (59).  Differently as expected, we observed an increase in the relative abundance of the Ruminococcus genus in the ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) group.  This result is in contrast with previously data which reported an inverse association between Ruminococcus abundance and a poly-unsaturated fat-rich diet (60). Indeed, the growth of the genus Ruminococcus spp. is usually supported by dietary polysaccharides (3) and individuals consuming animal-based diet or ketogenic diet tend to decrease the levels of the butyrate-producing Ruminococcus spp. which are mainly involved in the metabolization of undigested complex dietary carbohydrates and production of SCFAs (3).",bdf46dd8-b7ed-457d-a6ff-61331a41dbc0
40,discussion12," However, we may speculate that the daily intake of fiber (cellulose, pectin and lignin) provided during ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) intervention in the food form of fermented foods, berries and vegetables, was adequate to support the growth of Ruminococcous bacterial taxa.  Accordingly, we also observed that Odoribacter genus increased after ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) intervention. Odoribacter, belonging to the order Bacteroidales, is a common SCFAs producing bacteria (61), and, it seems to be associated with some metabolic health benefit such as the improvement of obesity condition (62, 63).  Importance of up-to-date database  To underline the importance to utilize an up-to-date database in such a new and rapidly growing field as microbiome analysis we reported here, briefly, the most significant differences between our previous analysis performed with Green genes v.13-8 database and the current Silva 138 database.",44778c9e-94e6-4fa4-b3dd-ea1ab8ed0625
41,discussion13," The almost daily advancement in new bacteria classification request the utilization of the most recent database Silva 138. To confirm this fact, the same data showing the main differences are presented in brief and showed in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 2.  Green genes v.13-8 database vs. Silva 138 database  At phylum level the differences in Proteobacteria disappeared with the more recent database, while the phylum of Actinobacteriota did not change: it increased in the WD group and decreased in the ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) group.  At genus level, the main differences were found for Ruminococcus and Dorea genera.",c0ccb81b-c6c2-48a7-af40-320eefa3a638
42,discussion14," In the previous analysis both genera were slightly reduced in the post condition for ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) and increased in the WD group, while, with the recent Silva 138 database, the genus of Ruminococcus increased in ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) group while Dorea disappeared.  More specifically, Green gene database revealed an increase in Bifidobacterium, Roseburia, Butyricicoccus and Gemmiger genera in the WD group, and an increase in Parabacteroides and Odoribacterter genera for ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) group; differently, the last database revealed an increase in Clostridia UCG-014, Butyricimonas and Odoribacterter genera in the ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) group, while the genus of Paracteroides disappeared.",4b7fe6f2-8567-4b83-9baa-9608d30b52ed
43,discussion15,"  The potential mechanisms of positive effects of ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet on gut microbiome  Our findings suggest that ketogenic diet may partially affect the intestinal ecosystem throughout different mechanisms. We hypothesized that one of these mechanisms might include the production of SCFAs and especially butyrate. Indeed, we supposed that during ketogenic diet, SCFAs and butyrate may be originated from:  i) the liver and then secreted into the gut (because of the ketogenic state);  ii) ketogenic regimens adequately formulated for supplying a medium but adjusted amount of plant-based fermentable fiber to be fermented by SCFAs-producing bacteria;  iii) butyrate producing bacteria such as Odoribacter, Butyricimonas and Ruminococcus;  iv) specific food sources included in ketogenic diet that may directly provide the adequate amount of butyric acid such as dairy foods (butter and cheese);  v) fermented foods (kefir, yogurt, tempeh),",83fbd0d9-35cc-42c1-ad33-ac95a34171c1
44,discussion16," naturally enriched in SCFAs (64–67).  As a matter of fact, butter is one of the richest butyric acid food sources with an inherent natural supply of 3–4% of fat content as butyric acid. For example, one tablespoon of butter is composed of 560 mg of butyric acid (68). Thus, for individuals following a ketogenic diet, it is easily possible to consume well more than 1,000 mg of butyrate in a day, from natural sources (68). Hence, butyrate acts in synergy with the ketogenic goals since it represents a direct substrate to undergo beta-oxidation (69).  In line with these concepts, Nagpal et al. observed a slight increase in fecal butyrate after 6-weeks of modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet. The authors supposed that the butyrate might have originated in the liver as consequence of the ketogenic state, or the ketogenic diet might have promoted the intestinal production of butyrate by supplying plant-based fermentable fibers to be fermented by bacteria (65).",e24afbd8-9553-40d9-b784-e9ff005ec0a5
45,discussion17,"  Notably, it should be also underlined that our ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) was composed also of functional fermented products (kefir, kimchi, whole yogurt and fermented cheese) which are naturally enriched in short-chain fatty acids (64).  In addition, beta-hydroxybutyrate derived from hepatic production during ketogenesis, has also the ability to influence, directly or indirectly, the gut microbiome, providing additional support for the fundamental function of ketone bodies at both intestinal and systemic level (34).  Current limitations  Despite these interesting results, our study is not without limitations. First, the reduced sample size of our cohort of athletes may represent a limit for a real robust statistical difference in gut microbiome profiling.",d1a7a846-2e17-4e61-8fdf-998069d08235
46,discussion18," Moreover, our analysis has been performed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing which represent the most applied method to investigating gut microbiome, but it is not efficient as shotgun metagenomic sequencing (70). Indeed, 16s rRNA targets and reads a region of the 16S rRNA gene while shotgun technique sequences all given genomic DNA while achieving strain-level resolution. The results is that 16S rRNA gene sequencing detects only part of the gut microbiome community revealed by shotgun sequencing and it does not provide a functional profiling of gut microbes (71). However, a technical challenge was considerable at the time of analysis. Since our research was conducted there years ago and shotgun metagenomic was orders of magnitude more expensive and relatively new than amplicon analysis (~$150 USD for shotgun and ~$50 USD for 16S), at that moment, 16S rRNA sequencing represented the best and most used method for microbiome studies.",848bb6a0-1903-4e28-9520-75e50f183705
47,discussion19," Moreover, it is important to highlight that also regular physical exercise, such as that performed by our cohort of semi-professional soccer players, might have influenced the results of the study by promoting the maintenance of a functional and physiological microbiota in both groups (72).  Further studies on KD on athletes would help validate these findings in gut microbiome and, thanks to the innovative available bioinformatic platforms, the integration of omics-data with the metagenomic methods may improve the understanding of the relationship between diet, gut microbiome and physical exercise (73). In addition, our study did not measure the level of SCFAs that could be an additional finding helping the explanation of the underlying mechanisms and of the interpretation of results.  Conclusion  There is a growing body of research on the role of gut microbiome in sport and performance.",484a57e8-7208-4851-8ac9-d3d5195c8719
48,discussion20," For the first time our results demonstrate that (i) ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet may be considered a feasible and safe nutritional strategy for athletes to get an adequate body composition, (ii) ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet do not change the overall composition of gut microbiome and, (iii) 30 days of ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) intervention may represent an alternative tool for maintaining and/or modulating the composition of gut microbiome in athletes practicing regular exercise. These findings suggest that ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet may represent an efficient dietary pattern for athletes, according to the notion that preserving a stable gut microbiome during dietary intervention represent a marker of gut health and greater athletic performance.",7f29fd14-6b30-4fe5-ade9-a0d4410ad94a
49,discussion21,"  It should be stressed that our ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet was mainly composed by healthy fats (good sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats), fibers (low-carb veggies, seeds), plant-based protein (tofu, tempeh) and fermented foods (kefir, tempeh, yogurt, kimchi), different from a standard high fat–low fibers ketogenic diet, which may not arouse the same beneficial effects on gut microbiome. Our findings demonstrate also that changes in microbial taxa pre and post intervention significantly correlate with environmental variables such as athlete's macronutrient intake.  Finally, it should be emphasized that data analysis performed with not updated database may give back partially different results as we demonstrated here.
