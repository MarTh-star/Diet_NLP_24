0,discussion0," KBs display a broad array of biological effects in the brain beyond their role as metabolic fuels. It is important to bear in mind that some of the biological effects described above that might be attributed to KBs have only been observed in ketogenic diet-fed experimental animals, but a direct action imparted by KBs has not been fully confirmed yet. Moreover, the metabolic rates in terms of fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis in rats and mice are different, which may well also account for the diverse biological effects observed using different experimental models, as ketotic levels might not be comparable (Puchalska and Crawford, 2017). From a basic point of view, understanding their contribution to the modulation of neuronal function can provide new layers of regulation of neuronal excitability, thus adding up to the complexity of networks and circuits in the brain.",929035f8-dea6-456f-b30d-d23dabfe8427
1,discussion1," From a translational point of view, their importance is underscored by the use of ketogenic diets to treat pharmacoresistant epilepsy, as well as potentially other neurological and rare metabolic disorders for which ketogenic diets are currently being evaluated (Paoli et al., 2014; Dahlin et al., 2015; Heussinger et al., 2018; Oonthonpan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). Unfortunately, the extreme composition of ketogenic diets makes it non-palatable and difficult to tolerate by many patients, who develop gastrointestinal complications , ultimately compromising compliance. In addition, recent studies have alerted of potential side effects , including an increase in serum lipidemia with concomitant increased risk of cardiovascular alterations , higher risk of bone mass reduction , long-term alterations in the immune system , or increased probabilities for cardiac fibrosis (Xu et al.",c20a8c73-e8bc-41e9-aa33-f89c16520d65
2,discussion2,", 2021). Because of these potential adverse effects, and the difficulty to adhere to the diet, different dietary formulations are being proposed to achieve a therapeutic effect with a more tolerable nutritional intervention (Dallérac et al., 2017; Kossoff and Cervenka, 2020). Furthermore, the anti-seizure efficacy in patients treated with ketogenic diets is not always replicated in experimental rodent models, which hampers research on the underlying molecular mechanisms (Holmes, 2008), This is probably due to biological differences in metabolic rates and in cellular responses to KBs between humans and rodents, as well as to the fact that ketosis is tightly controlled in humans to avoid dangerous situations, whereas mice and rats fed a ketogenic diet are allowed to eat ad libitum. This becomes even more difficult considering the aforementioned differences in metabolic rates between rats and mice (Puchalska and Crawford, 2017).",ab1b2845-9921-4b79-b5da-ae1029739fa0
3,discussion3," Nonetheless, understanding how KBs work, as well as other ketogenic diet-derived metabolites, and gaining insight into the molecular impact of KBs in neuronal physiology, could significantly contribute to identifying novel therapeutic targets in which we can benefit from the diet, but without all the accompanying adverse effects.  One of the main questions is whether the therapeutic effects of ketogenic diets can be purely attributed to KBs or to other factors. KBs have direct biological effects, as discussed above. There is a long-standing debate on whether KBs are directly responsible for the protective effects of the ketogenic diet to prevent epileptic seizures. There are several studies addressing the administration of BHB, AcAc, or acetone in diverse models of epilepsy, either chemically or genetically induced. In fact, in some cases, direct administration of KBs may have potent biological outcomes (Likhodii et al., 2003; Nielsen et al., 2019; Pérez-Liébana et al., 2020; Si et al.",db7bbaa3-5414-480b-b685-18cb1c083b83
4,discussion4,", 2020), although their anti-seizure effect has been variable depending on the experimental model, which probably accounts for the heterogeneous etiology of epileptic seizures, and also the KBs may only act on some determined types of seizures . But in addition to the clear biological effects of KBs per se, it must be considered that the increase of KBs in circulation, either via fasting or through ketogenic diets, entails profound systemic metabolic changes (Kennedy et al., 2007; Longo and Mattson, 2014; De Cabo and Mattson, 2019). Some of these changes include lower glycemia, changes in the endocrine profile, and alterations in the circulating levels of other metabolites, such as amino acids and/or long-, medium- and short-chain fatty acids, with potential additional biological effects through diverse mechanisms (reviewed in Katsu-Jiménez et al., 2017).",5ef25406-c2b4-45ba-b972-70e553edb93f
5,discussion5," As an example, and as discussed above, BHB directly upregulates Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) expression by remodeling chromatin accessibility . However, another work had previously shown that lowering glycolytic flux, which physiologically happens in parallel to ketone body utilization, negatively regulates Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) expression (Garriga-Canut et al., 2006). This was attributed to subcellular compartmentalization of NAD+ reduction to NADH, which can modulate the assembly of transcriptional complexes (Zhang et al., 2002; Garriga-Canut et al., 2006). The fact that blocking glycolytic flux represses Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) while increasing ketone body levels upregulates its expression seems contradictory, as ketogenesis is activated as a result of glucose scarcity.",72d5fb7e-c3a1-4733-a229-90524cb309f3
6,discussion6," Previous reports had already linked Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) signaling with metabolic rewiring (Burkhalter et al., 2003; Giménez-Cassina et al., 2012a). In light of these findings, and given the importance of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in neuronal development and survival , it appears that metabolic oscillations have a profound impact on cellular physiology, and it highlights the complexity of how metabolic networks are tightly intertwined with physiopathological processes. Hence the need to dissect carefully the molecular impact of metabolic shifts and the crosstalk between different metabolic pathways.  Concluding Remarks  In summary, KBs are fascinating metabolites that exhibit a myriad of biological functions beyond their role as energy fuels, and they constitute an active field of research.",087a3358-c58f-42ce-bed4-bc0296fcad75
7,discussion7," There are still many lingering questions as to how they exert their biological effects, and whether they can exert such effects alone or in combination with the concomitant metabolic changes linked to ketone body increase. Understanding in depth their biology will not only provide new layers of regulation of neurophysiological processes highly intertwined with ketone body metabolism but may also contribute to opening up new avenues of research to identify and characterize novel therapeutic targets for neurological disorders.
