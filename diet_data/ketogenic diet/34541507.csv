0,methods0," Questionnaire  The questionnaire was composed of three validated questionnaires: the ASKU (Allgemeine Selbstwirksamkeit Kurzskala) [6], the PAM 13-D (Patient Activation Measure) [7], and the AKKOM (questionnaire on complementary and alternative medicine, developed by the working group Prevention and Integrative Oncology of the German Cancer Society) [2]. The development and testing of the questionnaire has been reported before [8]. The questionnaire was divided into seven sections containing 71 questions in total:Demographic data (age, gender, education, marital status, religion, number of children, type and time of cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment and lay-etiologic concepts)  General self-efficacy scale  Patient Activation Measure  Complementary medicine (interest in, aims with and usage of complementary medicine sources of information)  Importance and satisfaction with information the patients got about their disease.",f2bdf5f2-27b9-41de-9c0f-8df34b0d2e3a
1,methods1,"  The questionnaire included different types of questions, such as closed, multiple choice as well as 4-point and 5-point Likert scales questions.  The anonymous questionnaire was distributed as print version.  Patients  We included adult patients (≥ 18 years) with cancer attending an oncological outpatient clinic for the pilot study and patients attending a series of lectures on complementary medicine in different regions of Germany.

2,analysis0," Exporting data was managed using Excel 2019. We utilized IBM SPSS Statistics 27 for data collection and analysis. To analyze associations between variables, chi-square tests were used and p values smaller than 0.05 were considered significant.  Ethics vote  Participation was voluntary and had no influence on the counseling on Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) or treatment. Written informed consent was given by filling in the questionnaire. The survey was accepted by an ethics committee. ",99f95f8b-76c1-4511-a0f4-86a41f846b3d
3,results1,"6)	 	No answer	16 (2.5)	  Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) usage and goals with Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)  Nearly two-thirds of the patients reported already using Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) (294 of 484; 60.7%). The majority used Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in order to strengthen the forces of their body (82.3%) or the immune system (78%). Improvement of well-being (58.7%) and detoxification (27.4%) were further reasons. Less than a fifth used Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for healing cancer (18.4%). In contrast, reducing side effects, coping with mental stress, or supporting conventional medicine were only a goal for 6.1% of the Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) users. Detailed data are reported in Ciarlo et al. [8].  The categories of Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) methods that were most often used included biologically based (73.2%), whole medical system (63.",4c92a4bf-7c98-4736-a704-e9dc38aa9069

Detailed data are reported in Welter et al. [9].  Higher self-efficacy was associated with higher interest in Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) (p = 0.03). Yet, patients with higher self-efficacy do not use Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) more often than those with lower self-efficacy (p = 0.099). Some goals with Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) are associated with a higher self-efficacy. These goals are strengthening one’s own forces (p = 0.035), healing of the cancer (p = 0.008), or to do something for oneself (p = 0.",dc4aff83-84d6-4492-8084-50fd78599e94
5,results3,"039). Considering the methods used, patients with higher self-efficacy more often use homeopathy (p = 0.035), prayer (p = 0.040), or relaxation (p = 0.018). Yet, there was no association to meditation, yoga, or biologically based methods with the exception of vegan diet (p = 0.030). Also for cancer diets (low carb, ketogenic, Budwig or Breuss), there was no association.  Higher patient activation was associated with higher interest in Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) (p = 0.004) and usage of Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) (p = 0.012). Considering the different goals, no association was found to patient activation. With respect to Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) methods, patients with higher activation significantly more often reported using homeopathy (p = 0.007), prayer (p = 0.002), Yoga (p = 0.032), meditation (p = 0.002), low carb or ketogenic diets (p < 0.001) (but not vegan or other cancer diets).

6,discussion0," Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) usage is high in cancer patients and the type of Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) used was similar to former surveys with a preponderance of biologically based methods, mostly micronutrients [9]. Main goals for using Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) were strengthening the forces of the own body or the immune system. These goals are similar to former surveys [2, 3] even on an international level [10–12]. These goals may be categorized as general goals in contrast to specific ones as reducing side effects. This was also reported by Wode and colleagues [12]. In line with this, two studies report a higher self-efficacy in patients in mind–body intervention groups [13, 14]. Moreover, patients turn to mind–body methods which often aim at improving well-being [15].  In contrast, reduction of side effects was named only by a small minority. Also Koenig et al.",275c939c-137d-4e6c-abce-595d7c22bffb
7,discussion1," reported an improvement of tolerability to be a less important goal [16]. Accordingly, we have a contrast between patients’ needs and the endpoints in most clinical studies on biological-based Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) which aim at specific side effects.  Another important point in this context is that higher self-efficacy goes along with a higher effect of alternative treatments as Reiki which depend on a high placebo effect [17]. In fact, this would also explain the affinity of high self-efficacious patients to homeopathy.  Considering patient activation, a higher activation is associated with higher interest in Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and usage of Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). We found a broad range of methods being associated with higher activation which are quite similar to the methods used by patients with higher self-efficacy. Yet, considering the different goals, no association was found to patient activation.",5d39aa8a-4d1e-4290-86ea-491cba6cd31d
8,discussion2," Loquai et al. have shown that patients using Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) are more likely to be physically active and to look for psychosocial support or contact to self-help [18]. Accordingly, Hibbard et al. reported higher activation in patients better coping with side effects [19].  All in all, a strategy to discuss Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) with cancer patients may be to start with agreeing on the goals before discussing special Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) methods. Moreover, patients attitude and needs for holistic (mind, body, soul) care should be addressed. Considering these goals and attitudes, patients should be referred to the best matching methods for which respective endpoints have been studied.  Limitation  The most important limitation of our survey is the recruitment of the patients as we addressed participants of lectures on Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).",78a78bee-c736-4ad9-9ed5-c59b31fa00d3
9,discussion3," Thus, interest in Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has to be expected to be high. Yet, the rate of Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) users is nearly in line with recent German data [1, 3, 20].  Conclusion  Physicians might focus on patient activation as a goal in patient–physician relationship which will help patients to adhere to a healthy lifestyle and to participate in the whole treatment process.  Also, self-efficacy may entail positive effects if it is directed on goals such as coping with cancer and distress which may improve quality of life [17, 21, 22]. Providing information on mind–body techniques or self-help group participation may focus these patients on beneficial activities [23]. ",2fe09080-c65f-43ba-a17a-1c99c53cbc68
