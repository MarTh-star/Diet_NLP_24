0,introduction0,"Previously, we have shown that Every-Other-Day-Fasting (Every Other Day Fasting (EODF)) improves neurological recovery in rats following cervical and thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) [1-3]. Despite this demonstration of neuroprotective and functional benefits of Every Other Day Fasting (EODF), concerns have been voiced regarding the additional weight loss such a dietary regime would likely induce in acute spinal cord injury (SCI) patients at a time when they are already nutritionally vulnerable and prone to losing weight. Therefore, we explored the implementation of an alternative dietary strategy that mimics the increase in neuroprotective ketone bodies as that observed with Every Other Day Fasting (EODF), albeit while consuming food.   Ketogenic diets (KD) are high in fat while carbohydrates are kept at a minimum level.",6c387b2b-7ac7-48a5-9259-eed1208a17fe
1,introduction1," A physiologically low intake of carbohydrates causes a metabolic state of increased hepatic ketogenesis, which results in high levels of blood ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone) due to the breakdown of fatty acids [4,5]. These ketone bodies cross the blood brain barrier and enter neuronal and glial cells through monocarboxylic acid transporters (monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)s) of which monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1 is the primary isoform found in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells. After uptake into the mitochondria, ketone bodies are converted to acetyl-CoA, to enter the tricarboxylic acid pathway for ATP generation [6-13].   KD was discovered in the 1920 for the treatment of epilepsy and only recently validated as an effective non-pharmacological preventive treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy.",61696d39-7fe0-4f43-893f-3366afc833db
2,introduction2," Interestingly, a recent pilot study suggested that KD might also be beneficial in humans with Parkinson’s disease as significant improvement on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale were seen after as little as 28 days [14]. In the laboratory setting, KD has recently been shown to be effective in animal models of several neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, cerebral hypoxia or global brain ischemia, cerebral artery occlusion, and traumatic brain injury [15-19].    To date, the potential benefits of KD have never been tested in the context of spinal cord injury (SCI). Hence, we assessed the effectiveness of KD comprised of a 3:1 ratio of fat to carbohydrate plus protein in which the carbohydrate content is limited to 3% by wet weight. Since most clinical injuries occur at the cervical level of the spinal cord, we tested KD in a C5 hemi-contusion model in rats.",26913286-a163-404d-b085-c550b28a3586
3,introduction3," We used a wide variety of behavioral and histological assays to test the effects of KD after spinal cord injury (SCI). To understand how KD might ameliorate spinal cord injury (SCI) symptoms, we additionally examined the effect of pharmacological inhibition of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)s after spinal cord injury (SCI). We hypothesized that inhibition of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) transport will attenuate the beneficial effects of KD supporting the notion that the benefits of this diet are directly mediated by ketone body uptake.

4,methods0,"All Animal experimentation was performed in accordance with the Guidelines of The Canadian Council for Animal Care and was approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of British Columbia (Permit Number: A010-0018). All efforts were made to minimize suffering and the number of animals used. All surgery as well as behavioural and histological analyses were performed blinded to the treatment assignment of the animals.  Animals and general housing conditions Upon arrival young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (~350g; Charles River Breeding Laboratory) were group-housed (21°C; 12h:12h light:dark cycle) and given ad libitum access to standard rodent diet (LabDiet-5001; Purina Mills Brentwood, MO).

8,methods5,"   Food intake The average caloric intake was calculated by multiplying daily food intake per cage over a 24-hour period with the calorie density of the appropriate diet divided by number of rats in the cage.   Blood ketone levels To measure blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentration (mmol/L), Medisense Precision Xtra monitor (Abbott Laboratories, Canada) was used with blood obtained by tail vein puncture.   Cylinder rearing task Details on forelimb usage during rearing have been described previously [23,24]. The animals were videotaped during spontaneous vertical exploration in a plexi-glass cylinder, and a frame-by-frame analysis of the forelimb usage during 20 independent rears was performed. During a rearing motion, paw usage of the affected forelimb was scored as “ipsilateral only“, or “both (ipsi+contra)” usage.   Grooming test Grooming is an innate behavior and was assessed as previously described in detail [25].",0d68f6c7-5710-4d30-9e1f-4430b72a2945
9,methods6," After placing a drop of water onto the head of the rat, grooming activity was recorded with a video camera for a total time of 15 minutes. Frame by frame video playback was used to score each forelimb independently by the maximal range of motion during grooming.   Montoya staircase reaching task The Montoya staircase is a device for the assessment of food pellet reaching [26,27]. Animals were placed in the Montoya staircase apparatus for a period of 15 minutes, after which the number of food pellets consumed on either the right or left side was noted (Dustless Precision Pellets F06506; Bio-Serv). To increase reaching motivation, caloric intake was reduced to 75% of food consumed during ad libitum feeding conditions. Pellets were color-coded according to the level of each well on the staircase to distinguish between pellets remained and pellets misplaced [28].",b9761d54-bc20-4a7e-b37c-f277542304db
10,methods7,"  Whishaw single pellet reaching task The Whishaw chamber consists of a plexi-glass box with a narrow slit through which the rats can reach for a single food pellet placed onto a platform attached to the front of the box. This platform has two indentations for the food pellets that are placed in such a manner that one can only be reached with the left paw and the other only with the right paw. High fat food pellets (Dustless Precision Pellets F06506; Bio-Serv) were placed in either the left or right indentations depending on pre-operatively measured paw preference. A total of 10 separate reaching attempts were videotaped and scored for 7 distinct reaching components as described previously [29,30]. Qualitative measures were analysed frame-by-frame.   Immunohistochemistry Paraformaldehyde perfusion-fixed and cryoprotected segments of the spinal cord (C3-C7) were frozen and cut longitudinally (horizontal) on a cryostat (Microm, Heidelberg, Germany) at 20μm.",63c75622-13ba-4398-87fd-14fcd0ce6afa

AB1286; Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). For detection, Alexa Fluor 488-, 594-, or 405-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA).  Assessment of lesion size Lesion area of longitudinal sections was based on the disruption of the cytoarchitecture using GFAP immunostaining. Total lesion volume (mm3) was calculated with the Cavalieri's Estimator of Morphometric Volume on 7x 20 μm thick tissue sections spaced 240 μm apart through the dorso-ventral axis of the spinal cord: [SUM lesion area * distance between sections]-[lesion area epicenter * section thickness] [31].",4fc42808-98ee-4566-a2bb-f477c6ea419a
12,methods9,"   Assessment of vascular density Immunostaining for RECA-1 and GLUT1 were used to characterize blood vessel density [32]. Digitized photographs at the level of the spinal central canal were used to count the number of positive blood vessels within a 750×750μm window placed over the gray matter at the penumbra of the lesion (with bottom of the window always touching boundary between gray and white matter).   Antrograde tracing of corticospinal tract (CST) axons To anterogradely trace ipsilateral corticospinal tract (CST) axons, 10% FluoroEmerald (Molecular Probes) was injected into the forelimb area of the sensory-motor cortex (4 injection sites, 0.4 μl each) as described previously [1-3]. Tracer filled ipsilateral corticospinal tract (CST) axon branches in the gray matter (1 mm rostral and 2 mm caudal to the lesion edge) were digitally tracked in 7 longitudinal spinal cord sections at 80 μm intervals centered on the epicenter.",9a85fad4-6f84-4cd8-b790-d3d8e89f485a
13,methods10," Sections were quantified and the total length of corticospinal tract (CST) axon branches in the gray matter at the C5 level for each animal was normalized to their C1 corticospinal tract (CST) average intensity to account for differences in tracing efficacy.  Analysis of tissue sparing Three microscope pictures were taken for quantification, all at the epicentre, 80 μm apart within the dorsal-ventral position of the corticospinal tract (corticospinal tract (CST)). Spared grey matter was measured as the minimum width of gray matter between the border of the lesion and the ipsilateral corticospinal tract (CST), i.e. the width of the spared dorsal horn (sum of all three sections). White matter sparing was defined as the minimum width of the residual ipsilateral corticospinal tract (CST) (sum of all three sections).   Western blotting 15 μg of ipslateral spinal cord protein samples 7 days post-injury (centered on the lesion plus 2.",52f13e1b-cc79-4122-9030-3cedfe2f8cbc

Protein density was calculated from digital images (BioSpectrum AC Imaging System; UVP, Upland, CA) with Sigma Scan Pro 4 Software (Chicago, IL) and presented as the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1/actin mean optical density ratio.  Isolation of total RNA and real-time quantitative RT-PCR Like for the protein analysis a 5 mm segment of the ipsilateral side of the spinal cord centered on the impact site was removed for extraction of RNA. Total RNA was extracted using a Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers’ manual. Quantitative PCR reactions were performed using the TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix Kit (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).",1a87dd29-c2f0-43c4-9004-d31a8f298675

Triplicate reactions were run for each sample for both the gene of interest and the endogenous control (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAPDH). Table 4 contains the TaqMan primer and probe sequences for the genes analyzed. Results are presented as 2-dCt, where dCt was difference between cycle threshold (Ct) values of GAPDH and gene of interest, a calculation that compensates for loading errors.

18,methods15," For intrathecal infusion, the polyethylene catheter was stretched to reduce its diameter. After a pre-puncture of the dura mater with a fine needle, the stretched catheter was inserted into the subarachnoid space (catheter tip ending at C2/3 level). The other end of the catheter was connected to an Alzet osmotic mini-pump (flow rate: 0.5 μl/h, model 1007D; Alzet, Palo Alto, CA) filled with either α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (4-CIN; 2 mmol/LC2020, Sigma Aldrich) or 0.9% NaCl-solution. All pumps were primed overnight at 37°C to attain a constant flow rate. The osmotic mini-pumps were implanted into the subcutaneous space at the back of the neck close to the lesion site. The skin incision was closed with sutures.   Seven days after injury, animals were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PF).",f58e4e4e-fc11-4f32-a822-4c3acd9fc75f

21,results0,"Food intake & bodyweight following KD feeding are similar to SD rats Both KD and SD rats showed less food intake during the first week after injury, except that the KD animals ate even less on day 1 and 2 than the rats on SD, likely because they had an aversion to a novel diet. Within one week following injury, food intake recovered in both SD and KD-fed animals (Figure 1A). By 2 weeks, body weight of both groups had returned to pre-injury levels and continued to increase similarly thereafter. Following 14 weeks of KD-feeding the bodyweight was similar to that observed for SD-fed rats (Figure 1B).   10.1371/journal.pone.0078765.g001Figure 1 Body weight, caloric intake, and blood ketone levels in rats consuming a 3:1 ketogenic diet (KD) or standard diet (SD) after C5 hemi-contusion injury (experiment 1).",2854f5b0-4cf5-45a0-b6d2-c5c5a6cf57a7

23,results2,"   KD-fed rats showed a larger forepaw range of motion during grooming Grooming is an innate behaviour that comprises different type of movements such as postural adjustments and forelimb strokes over the entire face, often reaching to behind the ears. Functional use of the forelimbs was evaluated by examining the active range of motion of each forelimb during grooming. KD rats showed significantly higher grooming scores compared to SD animals (p=0.051; Figure 2A-B). The majority of animals in the KD group (7 out of 11; 63.6%) were able to raise their affected paw up to eye level (score 3), whereas most of the SD animals (7 out of 9; 77.8%) could at best reach as far as the nose (score 0-2; Figure 2C; p=0.064, Pearson Chi-square).

26,results5," The Montoya staircase test for reaching success represents a convenient tool for the bilateral measurement of an animal's forelimb extension and grasping skills.   In the Montoya staircase test animals reach from a central platform with their forelimbs to retrieve food pellets from eight descending steps with shallow wells [26,27]. The pellets in lower wells are more difficult to grasp than those in wells higher on the staircase. KD-fed rats exhibited greater reaching success with the ipsilateral paw compared to SD animals at 6 weeks post-injury (t(1,34)=2.640, p=0.012; Figure 3A), with no differences were observed for pellet retrieval with the contralateral paw (Figure 3B). When using the ipsilateral paw, KD-fed animals were able to retrieve significantly more number of pellets from well number 3 and 4 compared to SD animals (ANOVA repeated measures, F(1,34)=6.971, p=0.012; well#3, t(34)=2.725, p=0.010; well#4, t(34)=2.592, p=0.014, respectively; Figure 3C).",8b12dcf0-c1a7-422f-9b67-7d2511daec9b
27,results6," It is noteworthy here that analysis of the video recording revealed that rats were able to use their tongue to retrieve pellets from the top two steps. Reaching is therefore only considered successful if the pellets were eaten from the bottom five steps (well 3-8). Somewhat surprisingly, the improved retrieval success with the ipsilateral paw was lost when tested at 12 weeks post injury (Figure 3A). Again this finding was robust, as in an additional KD-experiment we found a similar improvement in staircase performance at 6 weeks post-injury (t(25)=3.727, p=0.001; Figure 4) which again was lost when followed up at a later time point (Figure 4). There is a possibility that animals could potentially adopt a variety of whole body or postural compensatory strategies in order to obtain food pellets. These compensatory strategies, might have partially masked the differences between both groups at the later time points.",dfd263ea-3931-46d6-8d37-e26c5b4ee897

It has recently been shown that rodent digit use during grasping actions are very similar to that described for primates [35]. Reaching chambers like the ones used in the Whishaw test allow for a detailed analysis of the components of the reaching movements [29,30] and have been useful for the investigation of skilled forepaw use and motor functioning deficits after unilateral spinal cord damage in rodents [30].",4f8bfbac-b617-40d0-b1fc-6539d51eb3f3
30,results9," The injury affected the animals’ ability to grasp food pellets and to pronate the paw, while supination II and release of the food pellet were basically abolished (Figure 5A-B). KD treatment, however, resulted in higher average scores for the components grasping for food (t(24)=1.974, p=0.060; Figure 5C) and supination I (t(24)=2.464, p=0.021; Figure 5D). To assess their best movement capability of the different reach components, we additionally analyzed the highest score achieved during 10 separate reaches. Significantly more KD animals (50%, 6 out of 12) achieved maximal grasping scores of 1, reflecting their enhanced ability to perform normal grasping movements. In contrast, none of the animals in the SD group reached a score of 1 (0%, 0 out of 14; p=0.003, Pearson Chi-square).",fa2e06f1-98c5-48da-896a-904fb0827741

33,results12," Ipsilateral forelimb usage during vertical exploration in uninjured healthy rats is usually around 45% of total wall placements. After hemi-contusion injury, SD rats used their injured forelimb less than 3% of the time while rearing (Figure 6A). KD animals however, exhibited a four-fold increase in use of the impaired forelimb to around 13% (ANOVA repeated measures, F(1,18)=7.907, p=0.012).

In an additional, independent group the beneficial effect of KD on forelimb usage was reproduced (ANOVA repeated measures, F(1,27)=6.020, p=0.021, Figure 6B), demonstrating improved usage of the affected paw after 10 and 12 weeks of KD treatment (wk10: t(31)=2.114, p=0.043; wk12: t(30)=2.300, p=0.029).

37,results16,"   KD does not enhance corticospinal tract plasticity While there has been far less work on the effect of KD on neuroplasticity as compared to neuroprotection there are some molecular changes that indicate a potential of increased plasticity with KD. For example, KD increases serum leptin levels by as early as 5 days after starting the diet [36]. Leptin is known to be not only neuroprotective, but it also enhances neuronal plasticity in vitro and in vivo [37-42]. Another known molecular mechanism for synaptic plasticity is the AMP-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)), which is activated with various stresses including glucose deprivation as would occur on a KD [43,44]. Bcl-2, a protein that controls the mitochondrial membrane transition pore, not only prevents apoptosis but may also promote in vivo regeneration in the CNS [45-47].",989014f6-40c0-4454-8bc3-16d315f181a8
38,results17," A 3 week pretreatment with KD or a 4 day infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) resulted in an increase in bcl-2 levels in the brain [18], and thus could potentially be another mechanism to improve axonal plasticity after spinal cord injury (SCI). Finally, the stimulating effect of KD on mitochondrial density [48]could induce neuronal plasticity. Dendritic mitochondria have been implicated in synapse formation following hippocampal stimulation and the number of mitochondria is correlated with the number of newly formed synapses [49-51].  These four potential pathways mentioned above provide a rationale to also assess whether KD increases plasticity/regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI). We anterogradely traced the left corticospinal tract projecting to the ipsilateral gray matter of the spinal cord. When comparing the C5/C1 ratio within 1 mm rostral (SD: 106.2 ± 20.8; KD: 83.7 ± 16.3, p=0.42) and 2mm caudal (SD: 113.8 ± 47.7; KD: 98.2 ± 31.1, p=0.",e3c70682-269f-4c8b-ba70-a963b8de383f

We also observed HIF1α immunoreactivity in the lesion penumbra most prominently – but not exclusively - associated with astrocytes (not shown).

Importantly, we demonstrated that after returning to a standard diet after 12 weeks of consuming KD, the functional benefits were maintained. Besides improved behavioral recovery, KD treatment reduced lesion size and increased grey matter sparing.

48,discussion1,"    We initiated KD not until 4 hours after injury and food intake was low for 2 days. This time window of intervention differs from the majority of drug treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI), which have been studied with only little to no delay [58,59]. For most treatments only a 30-min time window of intervention has been established thus far, which unfortunately can only be achieved in a small subpopulation of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. By this time window criterion KD is one of most effective treatments and hence the translation of KD to humans seems feasible.    In contrast to a high fat diet used in obesity research, the 3:1 KD used in our study is a very low carbohydrate, high fat diet; while many high-fat diets used in obesity laboratory animal research contain a decreased fat to carbohydrate ratio (i.e. increased carbohydrate content). In our study both groups had ad libitum excess to either 3:1KD or SD. Spinal cord injured rats fed a 3:1KD diet containing 6.",ac74e705-cb3b-4854-ab42-3d1a8004be06

Interestingly, when we treated animals with a 7:1KD after a mild dorsolateral crush injury, improved paw usage during spontaneous vertical exploration was evident (data not shown); however, this improvement was accompanied by a reduced body weight. We hypothesized that the low protein content in 7:1 KD was inadequate for general growth, given that raising the protein content in the 3:1 KD prevented weight loss. The absence of significant weight loss or weight gain with the 3:1 KD makes this formulation much more clinically applicable.  The unilateral contusion model used in our study produced marked impairments in skilled reaching with the ipsilateral forelimb, as illustrated by the decreased ability to retrieve pellets in the staircase test.",bbb3eca2-b833-4ef1-b5c8-b8325f84a0bc
50,discussion3," The improvement seen in pellet reaching at 6 weeks post-injury by KD was robust and reproducible in our hands. We surmise that the decline during follow-up assessment could be due to the fact that animals experience limited success while attempting to reach the pellets with the ipsilateral paw, so they choose not to make further attempts. Such “learned non-use” of the ipsilateral forelimb has been reported following stroke in monkeys, rats and humans [29,60,61]. In our study, a similar phenomenon can be observed for both SD and KD fed animals in the cylinder rearing test. Over the time course of the experiment both groups exhibited a decline in general paw usage.   KD treatment significantly improved reaching components that involve fine manipulation of the distal muscles of the digits and supination. These involve the integration of several motions including paw rotation, continued pellet grasp and coordinated arm withdrawal.",adde4028-b9c6-4d82-a171-0c750d870779
51,discussion4," This is clinically relevant, since a recent study showed that humans and rats display a similar sequence of digit flexion/extension and supination/pronation movements during reaching for food [35]. Since similarities in fine hand movements exist between rodents and humans, our results would imply that KD may impart improvements in one of the most coveted functions for quadriplegic individuals [34].   Others have suggested that some of the benefits of KD are mediated by increased endogenous ketone levels, since the exogenous administration of specific ketones has been proven to be protective in experimental models of Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and glutamate toxicity [62-69].",1705dce2-7fd4-4744-b75c-102e0703b98b
52,discussion5," Interestingly, intravenous infusions of β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) administered 1 hour after transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery ischemia significantly decreases infarct size [70]and similarly exogenous β-HB administration is neuroprotective when administered after a cortical concussion insult in adult rats [71].   The diet used in our study is mostly comprised of fats, constituting (65% of the total calories by weight). Fatty acids are known to induce the activity of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs), which results in a reduction of the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, reducing ATP synthesis, mitochondrial calcium influx, and reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) production [66,72,73]. Sullivan et al.",ad71ef1d-59aa-44bb-8dbf-579f918f242f
53,discussion6," [73]illustrated the relevance of these observations to the action of KD, demonstrating that mitochondrial UCP activity was increased while reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation was decreased in mouse hippocampus after KD treatment. Reduction of calcium influx, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are major mechanisms of secondary injury following spinal cord injury (SCI) and various agents/health supplements that reduce free radical production have been reported to increase tissue sparing and to improve functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) [74-78].   Although their was no obvious difference in blood vessel density as stained by RECA-1 [79], KD treatment did result in a ~30% increase in the expression of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) in the vascular system, which has been reported previously in uninjured rats [32]. It is notable, that whereas most Glut-1 vessels were RECA-1-positive, not all RECA-1-labeled vessels co-expressed readily apparent levels of Glut-1.",ab536138-1668-42fc-bb7b-38097b1be16e
54,discussion7," This suggests that KD may affect the regulation of the function of the vasculature, i.e. alter the efficacy of glucose transport across the BBB near the lesion site, however not the extent of spinal cord (re)vascularization after injury. Since the most overt increase of GLUT1 occurred in the gray matter at close proximity to the lesion site of the cord (i.e. penumbra), it is likely that the increased vascular GLUT1 density may reflect local changing metabolic requirements of neuronal cells after injury [80]. Local tissue densities of GLUT1 were found to be closely correlated with local cerebral glucose utilization and transport rate [81,82]. The protective property of KD following spinal cord injury (SCI) may thus be partially associated with restoring the delivery of nutrients to tissue and providing a favorable environment for cell survival and growth.",fc994821-d4b4-4df0-a8a7-f296789b02eb
55,discussion8," Although we were unable to confirm the reduction in GLUT1 by western blot analysis (data not shown), we suspect that analyzing a large volume of tissue (5-mm spinal cord segment) by during western blotting may have diluted the effect seen in some peri-lesion blood vessels.   Endothelial cells, astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes are capable of utilizing alternative energy substrates such as lactate, β-HB and acetoacetate. In agreement with others [9,83] we show that KD treatment significantly increased monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1 expression after 2 weeks, which coincided with changes in blood β-HB levels suggesting increased cerebral uptake of ketones. Our study and others have demonstrated that monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)s are a crucial component of the local energy supply, and the disruption of this transport can exacerbate neuronal damage [84].",b0125310-40c6-46f0-8b43-788966abf85c
56,discussion9," monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)s facilitate the transport of monocarboxylic acids such as lactate, pyruvate and ketone bodies across biological membranes. So far, 14 members of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)s have been identified but only monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1-4 have been found to be expressed in an active form in the brain and characterized as proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)s [85-88]. monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)s have an important role in various tissues due to their function in metabolic homeostasis and their requirement for the transfer of ketone bodies into and out of cells. monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1 is predominantly expressed by vascular endothelial cells, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes [57,89,90]. Recent evidence supports the notion that, not only the liver, but also astrocytes can produce ketone bodies from fatty acids [91].",9b39fb66-5fae-402d-b4de-497f7ce4b1ea
57,discussion10," Moreover, similar to lactate, ketone bodies might directly protect neurons from death [68] and thus may also play a role in neuroprotection leading to improved recovery of neuronal function after spinal cord injury (SCI).   Multiple mechanisms may account for the neuroprotective effects of ketones, which may be in part due to the reduction of neuronal excitation due to several mechanisms including the inhibition of vesicular glutamate transporter by acetoacetate, and increased adenosine levels (for review see 92). In addition, ketone bodies are directly used in the mitochondria for ATP production while glycolysis is bypassed lowering cytoplasmic ATP production, which in turn may increase activity of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels and dampen excitation (for review see 92).",75b12c90-ba3c-4e39-a94a-836ac2e0de57
58,discussion11," Since excitotoxicity is a major player in the secondary injury cascades after spinal cord injury (SCI) [93] the reduction of excitation by ketones may play a significant role in their protective effects after spinal cord injury (SCI). In addition, neuroprotection by ketones may be related to the upregulation of HIF1α[18]a known regulator of several neuroprotective factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)), vascular endothelial growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)), and stromal cell-derived factor -1α (SDF1α). It has been reported that HIF1α expression increases in the injured spinal cord [94], however, we could not detect any differences between SD and KD treated rats in any of the prominent candidate targets downstream of HIF1.",42b8814d-ed2c-4dc4-b893-f4ac080def11
59,discussion12," While we cannot rule out that our dissection technique might have diluted possible effects; these effects, if existing, are likely small or highly localized since with the same dissection technique we found a robust increase in monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-1 – that we also confirmed on the mRNA level (data not shown). Very recently, βhydroxybutyric acid, at concentrations that do occur under KD, was shown to inhibit class I Histone Deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC2), leading to increased acetylation at the Foxo3a and Mt2 (metallothionein) promoters of genes known to protect against oxidative stress [95]. In addition, this study found induced levels of MnSOD and catalase also known to protect against oxidative stress.   In summary, we show that short-term post-injury KD treatment provides neuroprotection, and conveys into long-term functional benefits following spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats.",ea9c55b2-d02e-45ed-96b3-79db14b4cb51
60,discussion13," Interestingly, KD preserved tissue following the primary impact but this was abolished in the presence of the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) inhibitor α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4-CIN), suggesting that transport of monocarboxylic acids such as ketone bodies played a role. Although 4-CIN is thought of as a specific inhibitor of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)s, it is important to note that it also inhibits the mitochondrial pyruvate transporter, as well as the anion exchanger AE1. More research will be necessary to clarify the precise role of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1 in spinal cord injury and KD.   We suggest that KD could be readily translated into the clinical setting of spinal cord injury (SCI) since this dietary regimen is already a well-established therapy for epilepsy, and KD formulas are already available for enteral feeding of human patients (Ketocal; Nutricia, Gaithersburg, MD).",af485d63-da95-4db8-a527-9936cd6129bf
61,discussion14," Our results call for a reconsideration of standard clinical practices, which have traditionally promoted high carbohydrate nutritional content in “standard enteric formulations” for acute spinal cord injury (SCI) patients [96-99]. We would encourage opening further dialogue on this important aspect of patient care in acute spinal cord injury (SCI), given the limited interventions currently available for this devastating injury. As dietary treatments like the ketogenic diet most likely evoke a wide array of complex metabolic changes, we do not exclude the possibility that KD may also act through other actions including antioxidant, energy metabolism, programmed cell death and anti-inflammatory effects. As we understand the underlying mechanisms better, it will be possible to develop more palatable dietary approaches or alternative strategies that produce similar or even improved therapeutic effects.",0814ab04-188d-48c2-88a5-cbb59a0b4b28
62,discussion15," As we have to feed the spinal cord injury (SCI) patient, changing a diet to a more protective one can be implemented anywhere in the world at low cost and without major regulatory hurdles.  We would like to thank Dr. Jamie Lecker (Bio-Serv) for her expert advice regarding the custom designed diets and Juan Felipe Molina in the Central Animal Facility for help and advice with animal care. =",aea4c0fa-79ef-4f84-81d5-5383adc3c177
