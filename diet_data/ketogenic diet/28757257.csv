0,introduction0,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, moderate protein therapy that shifts energy production away from glucose-based and toward ketone-based ATP production. It is effective in treating pharmacoresistant epilepsy (Neal et al., 2009; Sharma et al., 2013; Cervenka et al., 2017) and growing evidence supports its beneficial effects in diverse disorders (Yang and Cheng, 2010; Winter et al., 2017; Augustin et al., 2018) and in healthspan and lifespan . As the fundamental mechanism(s) underlying its success remain unclear, molecular changes induced by the diet must be characterized in healthy cells.  Recently we proposed that the broad effectiveness of the KD is related to increased levels of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)) , a pivotal molecule for redox reactions and the backbone of ATP generation.",300caa30-1c41-4371-a2a5-09d4428677d8
1,introduction1," Because fewer nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) molecules are reduced during ketone-based vs. glucose-based metabolism in brain, elevated levels of the oxidized form (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+) can be expected. Consistent with this prediction, we demonstrated that KD can induce rapid and sustained changes in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratio in rat hippocampus - an energetically demanding brain region considered a seizure gate  - but not in the cerebral cortex . Similar results have been found in aged mice with a ketone ester supplemented diet .  Elevated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ limits seizures and mediates lifespan extension (Lin and Guarente, 2003; Mills et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017).",ef38b4fb-7b5e-4c23-8d4e-175384800d11
2,introduction2," Experimentally increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ levels enhance mitochondrial function, protect against oxidative stress damage and decrease cell death (Kussmaul and Hirst, 2006), diverse effects that could be linked to downstream pathways. nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ serves as a substrate for two enzyme groups, sirtuins and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)s), that affect diverse cellular functions ranging from gene expression to DNA repair .  The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+-dependent sirtuin enzymes are important regulators of metabolism, inflammation, and DNA repair (Michishita, 2005). Sirt1 is involved in the deacetylation of transcription factors, growth factors, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory proteins . Sirt1 is essential for normal cognition, preservation of memory and neuronal plasticity .",feb164ab-85bc-4d2e-a91b-5b07520567ab
3,introduction3," Interestingly, Sirt1 has seizure-suppressing effects in animal models of epilepsy  and mediates benefits of caloric restriction, such as lifespan extension and promotion of cell survival (Lin et al., 2000; Cohen et al., 2004; Satoh et al., 2013). Sirt6 and Sirt7 participate directly in base-excision repair of DNA, thus decreasing age-associated DNA damage .  poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes add polymers of ADP-ribose to nuclear proteins in an nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+-dependent matter and are major consumers of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+. poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 plays an important role in cell survival and DNA damage repair (Grube and Burkle, 1992; de Murcia and de Murcia, 1994). DNA oxidation by reactive oxygen species induces a steady-state level of DNA damage and is a by-product of normal cellular metabolism.",87f500a0-08e5-422f-9acf-4f6677ceb3b2
4,introduction4," poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 is a molecular sensor for this type of DNA damage and both its activity and protein levels are affected directly by cellular levels of oxidative DNA damage (Dantzer et al., 2006; Bürkle and Virág, 2013; Shen et al., 2016). Although poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes play a vital role in DNA repair, their over-activation (and subsequent depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+) has been linked to diverse neuropathological conditions .  Since the KD rapidly increases nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ levels  and changes in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ levels modulate the activity of the abovementioned enzymatic pathways, we hypothesized that consumption of a KD would lead to downstream beneficial changes in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+-dependent enzymes’ activity in rat hippocampus.

9,results0,"To re-establish previous observations on rapid and sustained KD-induced increases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ availability , we treated a new cohort of rats with control diet or KD. In addition to replicating increased circulating ketones (mM: 0.76 ± 0.15 2d KD, 0.67 ± 0.23 3w KD, 0.05 ± 0.02 CD; p = 0.0189) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)H ratios in response to KD (Figure 1A), we established that the increase in ratio was solely due to an increase in the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (Figure 1B).

To address downstream effects sirtuin enzymes’ activity, and expression, which depend directly on the levels of the main substrate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ , were examined and the collective deacetylation activity of nuclear sirtuin enzymes (Sirt1, Sirt6, Sirt7) was measured in hippocampal nuclear extracts.",1def8697-36e1-4a32-b314-e010e4c74f97
11,results2," As shown in Figure 1C, a rapid, robust increase in sirtuins’ activity was detected at 2d of KD treatment compared to control, and remained elevated at 3w, albeit reduced. Changes in enzymatic activity could be reflective of alterations in gene expression of one or more of these enzymes. Analysis of nuclear sirtuins expression levels showed that Sirt1 mRNA was increased in animals fed a KD for 2d compared to control diet but normalized after 3w of treatment (Figure 1D). No significant mRNA changes were observed for Sirt6 and Sirt7 (Figures 1E,F).  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ also serves as main substrate for poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1, an enzyme that functions as a DNA damage sensor and participates in DNA repair. We, therefore, examined potential changes in the hippocampal DNA damage response after KD treatment.",a7936dcb-6cf0-4f87-816b-81d78dce3fb3
12,results3," A rapid and dramatic decline in poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 protein level was detected after 2d, with further reduction upon longer KD exposure (Figure 2A). Although poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 is a major consumer of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+, the activity and protein levels of this enzyme are modulated primarily by levels of oxidative DNA damage . Therefore DNA damage in hippocampal tissue was assessed further by quantification of 8-OHdG, a critical biomarker of oxidative stress. Dietary treatment with 2d KD decreased the levels of 8-OHdG, and a 3w treatment led to a further decrease in this biomarker (Figure 2B). poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 protein levels strongly correlated with the changes in oxidative DNA damage here detected .",0ff91cae-148a-4124-8cae-6bed1ef52821
13,results4," Together, observed decreases in poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 and 8-OHdG levels suggest that consuming a KD decreases oxidative DNA damage.

14,discussion0,"Here we determined that KD increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+, decreased levels of DNA damage and induced rapid changes in poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 and sirtuin enzymes. This cohort of changes induced within 2 days of KD exposure could thus be protective for healthy cells against oxidative and metabolic damage and provide key mechanisms rendering KD beneficial across a range of neurological conditions.  The time-course of changes in Sirt1 activity and expression parallel the persistent increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ levels  and support the idea that elevated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ increases activation of sirtuin enzymes. The ability of Sirt1 to affect the expression of genes implicated in a variety of functions ranging from neuroinflammation to proliferation and apoptosis  could explain the KD’s ability to impact diverse cellular pathways.",a5ba5fba-2f79-4bcc-ae78-fb970c37f985
15,discussion1," Sirt1 activity reduces cell death and inflammation  and increases neuronal survival and life-span (Cohen et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2012). Therefore beneficial effects of ketogenic treatment in decreasing inflammation and combating neurodegenerative diseases could be attributed to these molecular mechanisms (Gasior et al., 2006; Ruskin et al., 2009; Kashiwaya et al., 2013).  Several genes controlling ketosis, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis are upregulated after long periods of KD treatment (Cullingford et al., 2002; Bough et al., 2006; Kennedy et al., 2007). Augmented sirtuin enzymatic activity without enhanced gene expression observed at 3 weeks may be due to elevated levels of the substrate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+. As Sirt1 was found to play a role in hepatocellular lipid metabolism (Hou et al.",f83e6863-fdd6-4fd8-9c14-440ed8d3463e
16,discussion2,", 2008), the transient upregulation of Sirt1 could be a cellular response to the shift in energy metabolism from glucose to fatty acids and disappear after adaptation occurs.  Previous work illustrated that ketogenic treatment reduced reactive oxygen species . Notably, Sirt1 can prevent neuronal cell death by reducing oxidative stress  which has been implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders (Andersen, 2004; Guo et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2016; Islam, 2017). A consequence of oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial function is DNA damage (Beal, 1995). This type of oxidative damage occurs as a by-product of normal cellular respiration, and can significantly contribute to the process of aging and neurodegeneration (Yakes and Van Houten, 1997). Moderate DNA damage triggers poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 activation and DNA repair, resulting in reduced 8-OHdG levels (Hegedűs and Virág, 2014).",0e688b9c-6ba4-406f-84cd-357b480a1e93
17,discussion3," Our quantified decrease in 8-OHdG and correlated poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 changes suggest that ketogenic therapy can also rapidly and directly modulate DNA repair and oxidative stress. Therefore, potential direct effects, as well as elevation of Sirt activity and/or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ inhibiting DNA damage  and decreasing reactive oxygen species (Lin and Guarente, 2003; Barzilai and Yamamoto, 2004; Kussmaul and Hirst, 2006) could contribute to decreased DNA damage. Interestingly, inhibition of poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 can enhance mitochondrial metabolism and activate Sirt1 enzyme . Thus our data reinforce the existence of cross-talk between Sirt1 and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 , possibly triggered by KD treatment, and modulated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ levels (Fouquerel and Sobol, 2014; Hegedűs and Virág, 2014; Mendelsohn and Larrick, 2017).",ca99ce97-a9f3-4fea-8717-07e77c9280e1
18,discussion4,"  The rapid response of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ and downstream effectors may relate to the anti-seizure response found in some patients after just a few days of KD treatment (Freeman and Vining, 1999; Cervenka et al., 2017). Moreover, elevation in poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 activity, accompanied by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ depletion and reduced Sirt1 activity, was shown to mediate neuronal death after seizure induction in animal models . Our data point to an opposite effect of KD on these three cellular measures, thus hinting at these effects as potential anti-seizure mechanisms. In addition, neuronal cell death and hippocampal 8-OHdG levels were increased following kainate-induced seizures in rats and prevented by administration of antioxidants .",f06fe1ee-83e2-4966-b3bd-00a926a01dba
19,discussion5, The KD’s ability to modulate oxidative DNA damage and reduce 8-OHdG levels in the hippocampus suggests that KD treatment may also be protective against seizure-induced neuronal death and DNA damage.  Here we quantified altered endogenous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ levels and key downstream effectors as a direct result of consuming a KD and offered key potential mechanisms underlying anti-seizure and neuroprotective effects of ketogenic therapy. The changes found in disease-free animals in our current and previous studies  indicate that the use of ketone bodies as an energy source can be associated with a healthier metabolic phenotype and an enhanced redox state even in the absence of disease or senescence.,40a88f63-5f06-4ac7-a8f5-bc8c3fd2b486
20,discussion6," Furthermore, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ precursor nicotinamide ribose and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are proposed to combat cancer and a host of inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases (Basello and Scovassi, 2015; Lee et al., 2015; Ohmoto and Yachida, 2017; Vaur et al., 2017). We provide evidence that consuming a KD can mobilize similar mechanisms, and promote the metabolic resilience necessary to combat neurodegenerative and age-associated diseases.
