0,introduction0," Patterns of energy consumption are a powerful regulator of mortality and longevity. In addition to caloric restriction, which has been extensively shown to extend maximum lifespan across species [1–7], time restricted feeding (time restricted feeding (TRF); also referred to as meal feeding or intermittent fasting) may also improve morbidity and mortality rates [8]. Intermittent periods of eating inevitably lead to episodes of ketogenesis, in which fat is oxidized into ketone bodies, reducing the need for glycolysis [8–10].  Without fasting, ketosis can also be achieved with high fat, low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (KD). Importantly, long-term ketosis has also been shown to prevent cognitive and physical declines associated with aging [11–18].",5eb0ff60-fb94-4f76-994f-d0c3255c65d6
1,introduction1," It remains to be determined, however, whether time restricted feeding (TRF) alone can produce sufficient levels of ketosis to elicit similar health benefits and the extent to which time restricted feeding (TRF) with a KD may have additive benefits on the healthspan of older adults and other animals.  The process of switching from glycolysis to a reliance on fat-derived ketone bodies as a primary energy source is termed keto-adaptation [19, 20]. While nutritional ketosis has been proposed as an intervention for a number of age-related metabolic and neurological diseases [21–23], aged animals take longer than young to produce high levels of circulating ketone bodies [14, 15]. Understanding the factors responsible for delayed keto-adaptation in old animals, and how to overcome this, are critical as brain utilization of ketone bodies directly correlates with circulating levels in the periphery [24–26].",bfa28a13-2747-4fc0-9e2b-f4c4af6e7f82
2,introduction2," Thus, in order to design precision ketogenic diet therapy [27] that can improve cognitive functioning and physical health in older adults, it is imperative to understand ketogenesis across the lifespan and the metabolic variables that can delay or promote metabolic switching.  The prevailing theory regarding the initiation of ketogenesis is that ketone body production is triggered once the body depletes its glycogen stores. This glycogen depletion hypothesis likely stems from the body’s natural metabolic response to vigorous exercise or longer fasts [28, 29]. Following 1 hour of exercise, there is an inverse relationship between glycogen content and ketone body levels [30]. Given the presumed relationship between keto-adaptation and glycogen levels, it is conceivable that aged rats take longer to achieve stable nutritional ketosis due to higher levels of glycogen or altered glycogen dynamics.",82c2fd4b-b00c-419a-8746-043aad1d71b3
3,introduction3," There are differences in body mass with age [15], as well as evidence that aged rats have reduced glycogenolytic capacity [31]. Specifically, the hepatic release of glycogen [32], which increases blood glucose in response to epinephrine [33], is decreased in aged compared to young rats [34]. Thus, old animals may be deficient at converting glycogen to glucose on demand, which would decrease the rate of glycogen depletion. An alternative to the glycogen depletion hypothesis is that old animals have impaired metabolic switching, herein defined as the ability to utilize either carbohydrates or fat as a fuel source when appropriate. In line with this idea, insulin insensitivity occurs in advanced age [35–37], and fasting insulin levels are often elevated. Since insulin inhibits fat oxidation, higher insulin levels could also delay keto-adaptation.",6972fe94-d3c9-4140-9acf-1bbc0bae3a21
4,introduction4," The current study tested the extent to which altered keto-adaptation in old age was related to impaired glycogen dynamics or metabolic dysfunction in rats that were placed on time restricted feeding (TRF) (fed once per day) with a standard diet (SD) or time restricted feeding (TRF) in combination with an isocaloric ketogenic diet (KD).

17,results0," Age-related delays in keto-adaptation are not due to altered feeding patterns Keto-adaptation is the coordinated set of metabolic adaptations that ensures proper interorgan fuel supply in the face of low carbohydrate availability [38]. This process is enabled by metabolic switching from glycolysis to ketosis in which glucose oxidation is replaced by lipid oxidation and the synthesis of ketone bodies (primarily beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) in the liver. A proxy for keto-adaptation is elevated, asymptotic levels of blood beta-hydroxybutyrate that exceed 2.5 mmol/L in response to consumption of a high-fat, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD).  A potential explanation for delayed keto-adaptation, as previously observed in aged compared to young rats [14, 15], could be altered food consumption patterns.",cd803102-a223-4a48-b9d3-6e3e7bd7e2e6
18,results1," To rule out differences in food consumption, and to evaluate the amount of time that rats were fasted during time restricted feeding (TRF), caloric intake was measured for three hours postprandially and at 24 hours. Young (4 mo) and aged (20 mo) male Fischer 344 x Brown Norway F1 Hybrid rats fed 51 kcal of the SD or KD once per day, as well as young and aged rats free-fed regular chow ad libitum, were evaluated for this comparison. The ab libitum fed groups allowed for a comparison of food consumption patterns during time restricted feeding (TRF), as used here, and ad libitum feeding that is common in aging studies.  ANOVA-RM with the between subjects factors of age and diet group indicated a significant effect of time point (F[8,224] = 329.96; p < 0.001; Figure 1C) on the amount of food consumed for all groups, as well as a significant effect of diet group (F[2,28] = 35.86; p < 0.001), but no effect of age (F[1,28] = 0.58; p = 0.45).",84a8543e-12ba-4862-8287-de0913fa53bb
19,results2," Critically, the consumption patterns of young and aged rats on the SD or KD did not vary, indicating that altered caloric intake over time cannot account for the age-related delay in keto-adaptation. Diet group, however, significantly interacted with time point (F[16,224] = 67.59; p < 0.001). Specifically, the ad libitum-fed rats did not consume the same density of calories in the 3-hour postprandial period, and consumed significantly more calories 24-hr after feeding (F[3,30] = 113.326; p < 0.001). Furthermore, after 24 hours, the aged ad libitum-fed rats consumed significantly more kcal than the young rats of the same feeding group.  Figure 1 Dietary implementation.

Because the caloric intake in the SD and KD groups was significantly less in a 24-hr period than animals that were fed ad libitum, we compared the body weights of these animals over the course of 6 months (Figure 1B). Prior to diet implementation, there were no differences in weight across eventual diet groups (F[2,32] = 0.33; p = 0.",c20094ea-5a31-491a-985c-645ce4e747db

These data demonstrate that pathological overconsumption was prevented in the current animals without caloric restriction.  After establishing that food consumption patterns did not vary between age groups, postprandial blood glucose (Figure 2A) and ketone body levels (BHB; Figure 2B) during the first day of initiation of a medium chain triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) oil-based KD or a calorically-matched and micronutrient equivalent standard diet (SD). This procedure was done to examine if age-related delays in keto-adaptation could be replicated in these animals. Blood measurements were conducted every 3 days for 28 days in rats that underwent time restricted feeding (TRF) with access to 51 kcal given once daily. In both young and aged rats, the KD decreased blood glucose levels and increased serum BHB.",e200155a-0e13-4ec9-8368-8df046483e39
22,results6," Note, levels of BHB in the KD-fed rats that significantly differed from the SD-fed rats were achieved before those levels stabilized across weeks. Thus, keto-adaptation was defined as the point at which BHB in the blood reached stable levels that exceeded 2.5 mmol/L.  Figure 2 Keto-adaptation differs by age. (A) Glucose, (B) BHB and (C) glucose ketone index (GKI) levels of young and aged rats consuming either a KD or SD as a function of days on the diet indicate an age-dependent delay in keto-adaptation.

For all panels: time restricted feeding (TRF) standard diet n = 5 young, n = 4 aged; time restricted feeding (TRF) ketogenic diet n = 5 young, n = 4 aged.  The reduction in glucose and concurrent increase in BHB can be combined to quantify the overall level of ketosis using the glucose ketone index (glucose ketone index (GKI); Figure 2C).",1f418cbf-3d18-4aa5-92d1-20f27b6a6987
23,results7," Importantly, the glucose ketone index (GKI) tracks better with therapeutic efficacy of KDs in cancer than either glucose or BHB levels alone [39]. Briefly, the glucose ketone index (GKI) is the ratio of the molecular weight normalized serum glucose level (expressed as mol/g x dL), to the serum BHB levels (mM). Thus, lower glucose ketone index (GKI) values are indicative of higher levels of ketosis. Therefore, the time required for glucose ketone index (GKI) to be asymptotically lowered can be used to extrapolate the time it takes an animal to keto-adapt.  During 1 month of time restricted feeding (TRF) with either the isocaloric KD or SD, the glucose ketone index (GKI) was significantly lower in KD-fed animals (F[1,14] = 1459.55; p < 0.001). Moreover, the glucose ketone index (GKI) was significantly lower in young compared to aged rats (F[1,14] = 20.23; p = 0.001), indicating lower levels of ketosis in older animals.",af37aebc-58ba-40b7-b226-03d87cca9eae
24,results8," When examined longitudinally, the glucose ketone index (GKI) significantly changed across the 28 days (F[9,126] = 4.21; p < 0.001). The interaction between days on the diet and diet group was also significant (F[9,126] = 6.12; p < 0.001), such that the glucose ketone index (GKI) in KD-fed rats significantly decreased while the glucose ketone index (GKI) of SD-fed rats did not. Importantly, glucose ketone index (GKI) levels across days on the diet significantly interacted with age (F[9,126] = 2.78; p < 0.01), with young rats having significantly lower glucose ketone index (GKI) values compared to aged rats on days 4 (t[7] = 7.11; p = 0.001) and 10 (t[7] = 3.14; p = 0.02). No difference across age groups was detected from day 13 onward (p > 0.1).

25,results9,"  Age-related metabolic impairments delay keto-adaptation rate To assess the contribution of age-related metabolic differences on keto-adaptation, young and aged rats fed ad libitum underwent an insulin tolerance test (insulin tolerance test (ITT)). Insulin powerfully inhibits ketogenesis [40], therefore insulin receptor insensitivity and hyperinsulinemia could delay keto-adaptation. Notably, all animals were fed ad libitum prior to initiating the KD or SD, so these rats represent the basal metabolic state prior to experimental diets being implemented. ANOVA-RM with the between subjects factor of age indicated a significant effect of time point (F[6,54] = 83.33; p < 0.001), but glucose levels at baseline were not significantly different between age groups (t[9] = 1.70; p = 0.12; Figure 3A).

When fasted, aged rats had significantly higher insulin (t[29] = 3.14; p = 0.004), leptin (t[49] = 3.54; p < 0.001) and C-peptide (t[48] = 3.41; p < 0.01). In a subset of these rats, fasted glucose was also obtained and a homeostatic model assessment (homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)) value could be calculated as (insulin (mU/I) x glucose (mg/dL)) / 405. Aged rats had a significant elevation in homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) relative to young rats (t[20] = 3.36; p = 0.003; Figure 4D). Together these data show that aged rats fed ad libitum have metabolic impairments and it is notable that elevated homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) values are a risk factor for diabetes type II [41] as well as cardiovascular disease [42].",c128deb5-f8be-4d08-a9e1-5238467300f6

Keto-adaptation in young and aged rats is decoupled from glycogen content One hypothesis regarding the initiation of ketosis is that fat oxidation is promoted when glycogen content in the liver and muscles is depleted. The age-related delay in keto-adaptation observed in aged animals could therefore be due to increased glycogen levels in liver or muscle. Thus, to determine how glycogen dynamics interact with ketosis, we measured the glycogen content in the liver and muscle of young and aged rats on the SD or KD for at least 12 weeks prior to sacrifice. Most rats were fasted for at least 15 hours prior to sacrifice, however a small subset of rats was fed 1 hour prior to sacrifice.

This difference between fasted and unfasted animals was particularly evident in the aged rats and was not observed in the KD group, indicating that ketosis prevents fasting-induced glycogen depletion. These data suggest that long-term ketosis reduced liver glycogen content, but these levels were not affected while fasting. In contrast, aged rats on a SD that were fasted quickly lost liver glycogen, which was not observed in young rats. There were no differences in glycogen content within the muscle across age (F[1,50] = 0.47; p = 0.50), diet (F[1,50] = 0.04; p = 0.85) or fasted versus fed groups (F[1,50] = 1.31; p = 0.26; Figure 8B).

Because age differences in liver glycogen were only detected in fasted animals, all rats were sacrificed 18-22 hours after eating for quantification of liver glycogen content.

These data demonstrate that it is not critical for liver glycogen to be depleted to initiate dietary ketosis in either aged or young animals. Moreover, in aged rats that are transitioning from ad libitum feeding to time restricted feeding (TRF) of a SD, more glycogen is associated with lower glucose ketone index (GKI) values.

We replicated previous data [14, 15] demonstrating an age-related impairment in keto-adaptation, and extended these observations to show that keto-adaptation induced by diet does not correlate with liver glycogen depletion. While a lack of correlation between liver glycogen and level of ketosis does not in itself mandate a decoupling of these two processes, taken together with the rest of the data presented here, it is clear that ketosis can be decoupled from glycogen depletion.",7530b124-6efe-4e5c-94a7-9f1331821270
58,discussion1," Surprisingly, when fasted, rats in long-term ketosis had levels of liver and muscle glycogen that were comparable to young rats on the standard diet (SD) and considerably higher than aged SD-fed rats. Moreover, the KD appeared to enhance glycogen dynamics, with KD-fed rats showing an enhanced increase in blood glucose in response to epinephrine. Thus, age-related declines in metabolic switching do not appear to result from differences in glycogen storage and dynamics, but rather emerge from metabolic dysfunction associated with hyperinsulinemia.  Aged rats had elevated fasting and postprandial insulin levels while ad libitum feeding with standard rodent chow, as well as during the initial stages of keto-adaptation. In young rats, fasting insulin levels decreased significantly following the first 24 hours of a KD. This decrease in fasting insulin was not observed in aged rats during the first week of a KD.",085624a1-be65-4d12-9b19-184a19c2cf51
59,discussion2," In addition to insulin deficits, aged animals fed ad libitum with chow had significantly elevated leptin, c-peptide, and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). While some metabolic factors were significantly improved following time restricted feeding (TRF) with the SD, such as the insulin tolerance test, combining time restricted feeding (TRF) with a KD was most efficacious at restoring metabolic markers in aged rats to levels comparable to young animals, as well as enhancing the epinephrine-induced increase in peripheral glucose.  If metabolic switching is defined as being able to switch bi-directionally between periods of carbohydrate/glucose usage and fatty acid/ketone body usage [48], then the KD enhanced metabolic switching beyond what was observed with time restricted feeding (TRF) alone.",92a78900-a6b4-49d1-a911-b7d54f966787
60,discussion3," While time restricted feeding (TRF) did increase the rate at which aged rats could transition from glycolysis to ketosis, enhanced keto-adaptation was further augmented by time restricted feeding (TRF)+KD. These data concur with previous studies demonstrating the additive benefits of food restriction with a KD at increasing seizure threshold [49]. Surprisingly, young and aged rats in our study consuming the KD still showed an enhanced glucose response to an acute increase in epinephrine, beyond what was observed in rats fed time restricted feeding (TRF)+SD. This observation further supports the notion that time restricted feeding (TRF)+KD may confer the greatest improvement in metabolic switching. Enhancing metabolic switching may be particularly important in aged populations. While epinephrine is able to improve memory performance in young rats through hepatic glucogenesis, aged rats show an attenuated elevation in blood glucose in response to epinephrine, and no cognitive benefits.",9863f0bc-14da-4a40-9c81-2b0c33cde71f
61,discussion4," Thus, old animals do not cognitively benefit from this physiological stress response that is an evolutionary conserved mechanism to promote survival [50].  In the short term, consumption of a large quantity of fatty acids, and relatively little glucose, initiates an inhibition of glycogen production via the glucose fatty acid cycle [51]. These effects are due to changes in enzymatic activity in response to dietary composition [52]. However, the glucose fatty acid cycle is dysfunctional in metabolically impaired individuals, such as those with type 2 diabetes. Thus, it is conceivable that the aged rats in the current study, which had elevated fasting insulin and impaired insulin sensitivity, may have metabolic deficits that produce impairments in the glucose fatty cycle. How this specifically interacts with long-term versus cyclical dietary ketosis is an avenue of investigation worth pursuit.",88353538-f994-4416-855e-631048f5231f
62,discussion5," Additionally, weight differences across age groups may also be an influencing factor on keto-adaptation, as obesity increases the incidence of insulin resistance and other metabolic issues, and could be addressed in future studies through the implementation of weight control measures prior to KD intervention.  Although time restricted feeding (TRF) alone can enhance metabolic switching, and improve cognitive health across the lifespan [8, 9, 48, 53–55], the current data suggest that additional benefits can be obtained through nutritional ketosis. It is also notable that the benefits of time restricted feeding (TRF) for cognitive function might be due to comparisons with ad libitum fed rodents that are metabolically morbid [56]. In fact, it is well documented that excessive energy consumption can lead to cognitive impairments [57–59].",83b34e25-bc37-4cb8-a66d-fbd132758138
63,discussion6," A strong indicator that time restricted feeding (TRF) alone is not sufficient for extending the cognitive healthspan is the wealth of studies demonstrating age-related cognitive decline in rodents while utilizing tasks requiring appetitive motivation. Many tests of cognitive function require animals to be restricted to <85% of their body weight to motivate participation by feeding once daily, making a large portion of investigations on the neurobiology of cognitive aging into incidental experiments of caloric restriction with time restricted feeding (TRF). While incentive motivation for food rewards does not change with age [60], robust age-related deficits are observed on working memory [61–63], other executive functions [64–66], as well as behaviors that require the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe [14, 67–69].  Importantly, there may be pertinent differences in metabolism, brain aging, and responses to dietary ketosis between males and females [70].",dac675d2-5ed7-4f81-a8fb-711a2618d546
64,discussion7," Unfortunately, the current lack of availability of female Fischer 344 x Brown Norway hybrid rats from maintained rodent colonies (https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/aged-rodent-colonies-handbook) did not permit the consideration of sex as a variable in the current experiments. Potential interactions of sex and dietary ketosis will need to be examined in future studies.  We’ve shown that combining time restricted feeding (TRF) with a KD provides a more robust restoration of metabolic health than time restricted feeding (TRF) alone. Furthermore, as the number of individuals living with metabolic disease (e.g. diabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, etc.) continues to increase, these data demonstrate the translational potential of time restricted feeding (TRF)+KD for alleviating many of the health burdens facing these patients.",2fb67ea1-df13-4e81-bfac-95714b927cd6
65,discussion8," In addition to the metabolic factors measured here, a previous study has shown that this feeding pattern can enhance cognitive function and decrease anxiety-like behaviors [14]. Moreover, time restricted feeding (TRF)+KD alters transporter protein expression within the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus [14, 15], increases BDNF [71, 72], decreases pain and inflammation [73], modulates KATP channels [72, 74], modifies neurotransmitter levels [75, 76] and lessens amyloid and tau pathologies [77]. Each of these biochemical alterations induced by ketosis are likely to confer resilience to cognitive decline.  In addition to peripheral health, memory deficits and other types of cognitive impairment have a profound contribution to decreasing quality of life in individuals and their caregivers. Although the increased mean life expectancy has had a commensurate increase in the number of aged people living without physical limitations [78], the same cannot be said for cognitive deficits.",43dec58d-643c-4033-9ec8-bb1180f71045
66,discussion9," In fact, the proportion of individuals experiencing mild or severe memory impairments will reach 1 in 3 by the 8th decade of life [79], and disrupted brain bioenergetics is a common feature of aging [80, 81]. Improving metabolic function in the aged population can have profound impacts on cognitive outcomes, as the brain disproportionately uses metabolic resources [80] Furthermore, cerebral glucose metabolism decreases with age, most notably within the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex [82], both of which are critical for higher cognitive function [83–85]. Importantly, this decline correlates with worse spatial memory performance [82]. Thus, developing metabolic-based interventions for improving peripheral metabolic health will likely have profound therapeutic potential for increasing the cognitive healthspan.
