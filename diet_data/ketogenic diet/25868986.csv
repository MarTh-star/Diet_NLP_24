0,introduction0,"Glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation are key energy producing pathways in the brain. These metabolic pathways may play a role in the control of seizures and epileptogenesis . For example, glycolytic rates are acutely increased during ictal activity  and ictal hypermetabolism in human epileptic foci is followed by interictal hypometabolism, probably resulting from a decreased mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity . Hypometabolism associated with seizures may reflect glucose transport abnormalities or defects in electron transport chain (electron transport chain (ETC)) enzymes . Seizures are also associated with an imbalance in ATP levels (Grisar, 1984) and represent a common symptom in patients with mitochondrial disease (Wallace et al., 1988; Mecocci et al., 1993; Liang et al., 2012).",12484767-781d-4b75-a850-bf664e54906b
1,introduction1,"  Although altered metabolism may be a feature of acquired and/or focal epilepsies, it has not been systematically investigated in any genetic form of epilepsy. Dravet syndrome (DS) is one example of a severe genetic epilepsy most commonly associated with de novo mutations in a brain-specific voltage-activated sodium channel (SCN1A). DS children exhibit significant developmental delays, cognitive deficits, behavioral disturbances, and increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP; Dravet, 2011). Two types of observations suggest that metabolic dysfunction may be occurring in DS. First, mitochondrial defects in muscle biopsies have been reported in patients. Second, some DS children respond positively to treatment with ketogenic diets (KDs; Caraballo, 2011). Although numerous mechanisms may underlie the efficacy of KDs , these observations suggest that energy metabolism is not well studied in DS, or any form of genetic epilepsy.",a89b4456-f8b4-4737-bfea-9c1df5b19730
2,introduction2," Here we developed novel techniques to show, for the first time, that glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration are abnormal in a zebrafish model of DS and its rescue by a form of a KD. Moreover, altered metabolism in scn1Lab mutants was accompanied by downregulation of several glycolytic genes rather than defects in select mitochondrial enzyme activities.

Baseline glycolysis rates in scn1Lab mutant and age-matched WT zebrafish were 7.70 ± 0.18 mpH/min and 13.06 ± 0.61 mpH/min (Fig. 1A; Table 1), respectively, indicating a 41% decrease (p < 0.0001)a of baseline glycolysis. Similarly, basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was significantly decreased in scn1Lab mutant zebrafish (189.3 ± 3.47 pmol/min) compared with WT controls (296.",9fc1d70f-0ae4-4273-9f11-fcea33b476f2

17,results10," To determine the consequences of increased neuronal excitability associated with induced seizure activity, WT zebrafish were stimulated with 4-AP and glycolytic and mitochondrial respiration rates were measured (Figs. 1A,B). 4-AP, a chemoconvulsant previously shown to induce electrographic seizures in zebrafish , increases metabolic demand in cortical cells and synaptosomes . Following metabolic challenge with a single, high dose of 4-AP, WT zebrafish showed increased behavioral seizure activity (Fig. 1C,D) and 360% increase in glycolysis within 8 min. Scn1Lab mutants, which exhibit spontaneous seizures at a rate of ∼1 ictal-like event per minute , also showed increased glycolytic rate after 4-AP stimulation albeit in a delayed manner, achieving maximal glycolytic rates about 30 min after 4-AP addition (Fig. 1A).",92350a90-6060-442d-9b5d-830e5f7b9e8c
18,results11," In scn1Lab mutant zebrafish, glycolysis was increased 350% from baseline to an average of 27.26 ± 1.12 mpH/min (p < 0.0001e, Fig. 1A). Both the immediate and delayed increase of glycolytic rates in WT and scn1Lab mutant zebrafish were sustained for the duration of the experiment, 48 min. After 24–32 min when scn1Lab mutant zebrafish had maximal response to 4-AP, the fold-change was significantly greater in scn1Lab mutant zebrafish than that of WT zebrafish. Behavioral seizure analysis on an independent clutch of WT larvae demonstrated that a single concentration of 4 mm 4-AP induced the severe convulsive seizure behavior (Stage III) at the 8 min time point in 23 of 48 larvae; circling Stage II behavior was noted in 25 of 48 larvae. After continuous exposure to 4-AP, seizure behavior corresponding to Stage II was observed in the majority of zebrafish larvae (47 of 48). Representative locomotion plots are shown for WT zebrafish at baseline and following exposure to 4 mm 4-AP (Fig. 1C).",89018c4d-0414-4247-9196-1af05a1dc1a7
19,results12," Mean velocity measurements, which act as a surrogate marker for Stage III behavior  were significantly increased at the 8 min exposure point (Fig. 1D c).  WT zebrafish showed a small, nonsignificant, increase in mitochondrial respiration immediately after 4-AP stimulation, which rapidly returned to baseline (Fig. 1B). However, scn1Lab mutant zebrafish showed a delayed and gradual increase in mitochondrial respiration with maximal increase about 30 min after stimulation. Mitochondrial respiration was increased ∼142% from baseline to 253.1 pmol/min in scn1Lab mutant compared with WT zebrafish.  These data, when plotted as oxygen consumption rate (OCR) versus extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), show a unique metabolic shift (Fig. 2A). At baseline, WT zebrafish are more glycolytic and oxidative than mutant zebrafish, but both processes are in a narrow metabolic field. Increased neuronal excitability shifts the metabolic field toward the glycolytic direction.",583af411-cac4-41ad-907a-7d472cefc11b
20,results13," The mutant zebrafish increase glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation after 4-AP exposure to approach the metabolic state of WT zebrafish after 4-AP. This suggests that mutant zebrafish retain a similar metabolic capacity as WT zebrafish, or in other words, there are no defective enzymes in the downstream energetic pathway. To confirm this, we assayed three different parameters. To ensure that alterations in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were not due to differences in mitochondrial content, relative mitochondrial copy number was determined. Results demonstrate that there is no significant difference between total mitochondrial copy numbers between groups (p = .2056h; Fig. 2B). Next, to determine whether oxygen consumption rate (OCR) differences were due to alterations in electron transport chain (ETC) activity, complexes I–IV were assayed in WT and scn1Lab mutant zebrafish. No differences were observed in the activity of any of the complexes (p = 0.9367i; Fig. 2C).",1f90fd8a-6512-44e1-b0be-3753b866c4a7
21,results14," oxygen consumption rate (OCR) may also have been decreased in scn1Lab mutant zebrafish if the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes were inactive, providing fewer electron donors for the electron transport chain (ETC). Analysis of aconitase, fumarase, and malate dehydrogenase demonstrated no difference in enzymatic activity in WT and mutant zebrafish (p = 0.5801j; Fig. 2D). This suggests that the primary metabolic defect may lie even further upstream, in glycolysis.  Figure 2. Respiratory chain complex activity in WT and scn1Lab mutant zebrafish.

23,results16," Since the activity of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes were unaltered in scn1Lab mutants and previous results suggested that genes related to metabolic processes are differentially expressed in scn1Lab mutant zebrafish , we examined gene expression changes using an 84 probe glucose metabolism microarray (Fig. 3A,B). Of these, six genes were changed at least twofold (Fig. 3C). Five of these six were downregulated in scn1Lab mutant zebrafish compared with WT and included g6pca.1, pck1, pck2, pdk2, and phkg1a. Gene expression was also analyzed 1 h after 4-AP treatment. In 4-AP stimulated zebrafish, four genes were changed at least twofold compared with untreated controls (gck, pck1, pdk2, and pdk4). PCR array results were verified using specific Taqman primers, which were available for pck1, pck2, and pdk2. PCR results verified fold-changes of pck1 (−2.83 ± 0.45), pck2 (−2.36 ± 0.45), and pdk2 (−2.23 ± 0.42) in scn1Lab versus WT zebrafish (Fig. 3C, inset).",77c6c899-1e06-4c85-b957-83044e9191d5

These results suggest that baseline decreases in extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in scn1Lab mutants likely results from mutation-induced downregulation of key glycolytic genes leading to an overall decreased flux of substrates through these pathways. Exaggerated responses in extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in scn1Lab mutants could be the result of mutation-induced upregulation of key glycolytic genes (ie, pck1 and pdk2). Together, alterations in glycolytic gene expression provide a mechanistic basis for ion channel related alterations in metabolism.  Figure 3.

27,discussion0,"Here we demonstrate significant decreases in metabolism in a zebrafish model of SCN1A-related epilepsy. These mutants exhibit hyperactivity, including convulsive behavior, spontaneous electrographic seizures, shortened lifespan and a pharmacological profile similar to the human condition (Baraban et al., 2013; Dinday and Baraban, 2015). We now demonstrate, using novel methodology, that these scn1Lab mutant zebrafish, representing one example of a genetic epilepsy, exhibit decreased glycolytic and mitochondrial respiration rates. Although mitochondrial respiration has been measured in early embryogenesis up to 48 h postfertilization  and cell-based (Giménez-Cassina et al., 2012) or rodent-based  systems, this is the first time metabolism has been measured in live zebrafish larvae and could be useful in identifying metabolic dysfunction in the growing armamentarium of zebrafish mutants.",65ca7398-3888-4050-80b0-af7483e9864f
28,discussion1,"  Hypometabolism in DS has not been extensively reported in the literature. However, in a single study evaluating the metabolic status of patients with DS, Craig et al.

The etiology of the comorbidity is not entirely obvious but the authors suggest an scn1a mutation is not the only cause. Our results support these suppositions. The scn1Lab mutant zebrafish did not show any defects in electron transport chain (ETC) complexes I–IV, suggesting respiratory chain defects may not be inherent to DS.  The mechanism by which loss of sodium-channel function results in the constellation of symptoms observed in DS is incompletely understood. Our results suggest a general decrease in expression of glycolysis related genes resulting in decreased glycolytic substrates driving mitochondrial respiration.",041240ca-1d56-4b22-adda-18d4183e59b4
29,discussion2," It is possible seizures, which are spontaneously occurring in these mutants, induce oxidative stress resulting in posttranslational oxidative modification and decreased activities of complex I . Metabolic dysfunction, in particular mitochondrial dysfunction, has been known to have epilepsy as a dominant or collateral feature of the phenotype (Finsterer and Zarrouk Mahjoub, 2012). In addition, mitochondrial complex I deficiency has been observed in human and experimental temporal lobe epilepsy . Whether the presence of seizures alone explains the metabolic deficits is unclear and needs further exploration.  Interestingly and consistent with a metabolic defect, KDs have shown efficacy in controlling seizures in some DS patients (Caraballo, 2011) and the scn1Lab mutant zebrafish used here . We now show that a KD also improves the metabolic state of scn1Lab mutant zebrafish to WT levels.",f13d2dc4-938c-4f9f-98e6-58028b88a04a
30,discussion3," One potential mechanism of action is that the KD alters expression of glucose-related metabolism genes in scn1Lab mutant zebrafish to WT levels. However, this seems unlikely because alteration of the genes reported here, and others, by KD has not been reported in the literature. Murata et al.

Jornayvaz et al. (2010) showed similar results in KD fed mice for pck, glucose-6-phosphatase, and pyruvate carboxylase compared to control diet. However, a more likely mechanism is that a KD alters the fuels available for glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to use. Impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics capacity can critically affect apoptosis, neuronal excitability, and seizure susceptibility .",3a937a8d-0ece-4161-92b5-9fbd3a7f7f04
31,discussion4," Ketone bodies can decrease the spontaneous firing of GABAergic neurons, dependent on KATP channels  and given the deficits in interneuron function thought to be associated with scn1a mutation this could be a direct site of action.  4-AP is a potassium channel blocker that is commonly used to elicit seizures in animal models, including larval zebrafish . Here, we demonstrate that WT zebrafish respond to 4-AP by immediately increasing glycolysis but not mitochondrial respiration corresponding with severe behavioral seizures. The metabolic alteration is reminiscent of ictal hypermetabolism  and it is interesting to note that scn1Lab mutants have delayed increases in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration after a 4-AP challenge.",fb5a6a81-2ea8-4b5f-91c5-5b346f927834
32,discussion5," We also report a significant downregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases (pck1 and pck2) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (pdk2) in scn1Lab mutant, genes important in gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Specifically, pck is responsible for converting oxaloacetate in to phosphoenolpyruvate, a glycolysis intermediary and its loss would result in less intermediates and less glycolytic flux. Pdk2 is a gene responsible for inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA. Decreased pdk2 would result in increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and less pyruvate and lactate. This could explain the lower extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) observed here . It may appear that increased pyruvate dehydrogenase would result in increased respiration in scn1Lab mutant zebrafish.",0b7764ce-01c2-4e39-b91f-7c92cca230c6
33,discussion6," However, because there are fewer intermediates, and less flux through glycolysis, it is reasonable that the overall respiration rate is reduced in scn1Lab mutant zebrafish. In WT zebrafish, the increase in pdk2 would increase inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase and subsequently lead to increases in glycolytic metabolites pyruvate and lactate, suggesting a mechanism for increased glycolysis.  Overall, our results suggest a metabolic impairment concomitant with a sodium channel mutation in DS, likely due to glycolysis gene-expression changes, and reversible by the KD (Fig. 5). We demonstrate this with a novel technique to assess extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in live zebrafish and propose that the metabolic impairment in scn1Lab mutant zebrafish may be due to changes in gene expression related to glucose metabolism (Fig. 3B).",45631f5b-9b99-4f43-8650-98b49221f078
34,discussion7," This approach was applied here to one genetic model of epilepsy, but opens new avenues for studying metabolism in any zebrafish model or as a means to screen compound libraries for new drugs that would improve metabolic function.  Figure 5. Summary diagram depicting proposed mechanism. Mechanism demonstrating changes in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in scn1 mutant zebrafish at baseline (in black) and proposed action of KD (in red).   Figure 6. Metabolic differences in WT and scn1lab mutant zebrafish are reproducible when grown in a separate facility, as well as with different instrumentation. All zebrafish in this figure were bred and grown at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (UCD). Using the same instrumentation as Figures 1 and 4 (XF24) the baseline differences are recapitulated in zebrafish grown at University of California San Francisco (UCSF).",950c64d2-ac2a-4bee-885b-665a364ee439

36,discussion9," The following reviewers agreed to reveal their identity: Annapurna Poduri, Timothy Simeone  Summary of NWR-0008-16  This submission describes metabolic consequences in the absence of the zebrafish ortholog of the Dravet syndrome gene, Scn1Lab. Both reviewers are enthusiastic about the study and agree that the work advances the field. However, there are several items that need to be addressed before the submission is appropriate for publication. In particular, the clinical relevance should be modified and the PCR array methods and results need to be better explained and included.  Reviewer #1  Advances the field: New techniques are presented that expand the repertoire of analyses that can be applied to zebrafish models of epilepsy and potentially other disorders.  Review - The authors provide an interesting new experimental paradigm to assess glycolysis and mitochondrial enzyme activity, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) activity, and related gene expression in a zebrafish larval system.",33aa01cc-42c0-4d97-8e87-9f8b92857b2b
37,discussion10," These techniques are worthy of reporting. The model used, the Scn1Lab, is an established and published zebrafish model of epilepsy.  What is not clear to this reviewer is how much of the effect seen in the Scn1Lab larvae is specifically related to SCN1A protein dysfunction vs a general inherent tendency to epilepsy that would be seen in any genetic model of epilepsy in the zebrafish in which spontaneous epileptiform activity would be expected to occur, at least episodically. Ideally, as more genetic models of epilepsy become available, it would make sense to use the array of techniques demonstrated in this manuscript to compare different models.  In addition to concern about the specificity of the effects seen to Scn1a in the zebrafish, I have concerns about the lengthy introduction and discussion of Dravet syndrome in humans.",935d240e-ed33-4d86-8358-9892867ba865
38,discussion11," The evidence for hypometabolism in Dravet syndrome is not strong, and in fact, we do not know the means by which the ketogenic diet appears to be successful in some patients with Dravet syndrome. Some of the references to ictal hypometabolism cited refer to findings in patients with focal epilepsy (NOT Dravet syndrome). As the authors do point out, the mitochondrial abnormalities noted, e.g., complex III and IV abnormalities, are not specific to patients with sodium channel mutations.  Thus, I would recommend the following:  (1) reducing the emphasis on the clinical relevance of these findings in both the introduction and discussion, including the removal of references that are not directly relevant,  (2) presenting the data as ONE example of features that can be assessed in genetic models of zebrafish, minimizing a specific role of SCN1A unless more data can be provided to support it,  and  (3) providing examples of such methods used in other systems (e.g.",6b7cc658-e1c6-41ec-b85a-c7c17d711792
39,discussion12,", cell-based or rodent) if they are available with a rationale for why they are applicable and useful in the zebrafish system.  Reviewer #2  Advances the field: This manuscript provides evidence for potential metabolic dysfunction in Dravet syndrome that should be tested in the future for confirmation. Furthermore, this study sets the stage for identification of metabolic dysfunction in other genetic epilepsies and performing high-throughput screening for metabolic therapies.  Review - This manuscript presents a unique and exciting study on metabolic dysfunction in a zebrafish model of Dravet syndrome. The authors find that zebrafish carrying a mutation in scn1a have reduced glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration rates. These functional differences were not correlated with changes in function of individual complexes in the electron transport chain (ETC) or enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. They were associated with down-regulation of genes involved in glucose metabolism.",57cc0ebc-4eef-4a50-915b-8d52415b57e5
40,discussion13," Acute 4-AP application resulted in increases in glycolysis, respiration rates and up-regulation of genes. Speculating that bypassing glucose metabolism may be beneficial, the authors' fed the scn1a mutant zebrafish a ketogenic diet and glycolysis and respiration were rescued to wild-type levels. This manuscript provides evidence for potential metabolic dysfunction in Dravet syndrome that should be tested in the future for confirmation. Furthermore, this study sets the stage for identification of metabolic dysfunction in other genetic epilepsies and performing high-throughput screening for metabolic therapies.  This study is well designed and strong, however, I have listed a few concerns below that need to be addressed. Most importantly the authors' need to address the questions concerning the PCR array experiment and develop the discussion section a bit more.  1.
