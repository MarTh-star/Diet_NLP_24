0,introduction0,"Epilepsy affects 1 in 26 people across the lifespan [1], and 25–30% of patients suffer uncontrolled seizures in spite of pharmacotherapy [2]. In addition, the incidence of side effects of anticonvulsants is high, and can lead to cessation of medications [3, 4]. Ketogenic diet (KD) is a metabolic therapy that employs a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein formulation developed initially to mimic the metabolic state of fasting [5, 6]: it is established as anticonvulsant [7], antiepileptic [8], neuroprotective [9], and particularly useful in some specific diagnoses [10] and in refractory epilepsy [11, 12].  Fasting and adhering to a KD each produce hallmark changes in blood ketone bodies (increased) and glucose (decreased) but it has remained unclear how these changes relate to beneficial effects.",6c3e192c-e762-458d-942a-6f7b4913c3fa
1,introduction1," For instance, blood ketone body levels do not always correlate with anticonvulsant effects [13], and in general anticonvulsant benefits of ketones versus glucose in clinical and laboratory work is mixed and still under active investigation and debate [14]. Furthermore, mechanistic links between these metabolic blood chemistry changes and anticonvulsant effects are unclear. Clearly many systemic changes occur with dietary therapy, making it difficult to sort out key mechanisms of efficacy. To date a number of studies have examined changes in blood metabolites aside from ketone bodies and glucose, typically examining a limited number of predetermined compounds to address specific hypotheses [15–21]. While cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) is significantly more difficult to collect than blood, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites may be more relevant to KD mechanisms in epilepsy [22–25].",6fb96285-6d1c-4565-a9d2-7f9062d89771
2,introduction2,"  Metabolomics is a liquid chromatography/gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy-based technique for quantifying all detectable small molecule metabolites, such as carbohydrates, small lipids, amino acids, etc. and has been used to describe biological phenotypes in epilepsy [26] and other neurological disorders [27] as well as dietary treatments [28]. Extant metabolomics studies of serum and ketogenic diet have described compensatory adaptations in amino acid metabolism [29] and correlations between metabolites and fecal microbiota [30] in experimental rodents. In general, metabolomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be a powerful tool for discovering KD-related mechanisms. Here we present novel data based on a set of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected twice from pediatric patients with refractory seizures – once before KD treatment and once during KD treatment.",5eea6343-7b45-4603-b677-2b95cec6f33d
3,introduction3," This experimental design enables each patient to serve as their own control, and thus the ability to compare baselines and changes in the metabolome to the observed clinical response. A metabolomic analysis of carbohydrates and lipids could relate the biochemical effects of the KD to the magnitude of the clinical (anticonvulsant) response, and enables a review of predictors of KD efficacy.

4,methods0,"Ethics The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Karolinska Hospital and the informed consent of the parents and, when possible, patients, was obtained.  Patients Patients have been described in detail previously [22, 23]. Briefly, the study was part of a larger prospective open trial on the efficacy and safety of the KD in children with epilepsy. The patients were enrolled consecutively as they attended the Epilepsy Outpatient Clinic and the decision to start the KD was made.  Inclusion criteria were an age of 1–18 years, pharmacologically refractory epilepsy with a prior trial of at least three antiepileptic drugs, consideration of epilepsy surgery, no medical contraindications, family and patient able to cooperate in a KD trial, and approval for performing two lumbar punctures before and during KD.

5,methods1, Parental reports were compared with the observations of seizure type and frequency made by the epilepsy nurses during hospitalization. A subgroup of 27 children were selected based on the most differentiated clinical outcome – namely those observed as seizure-free seizure and those with no observed improvement. Five of the patients became seizure-free and were classified as having “optimal response” and five patients had no detectable seizure reduction and were classified as having “no response” (see Table 1). In these ten included children metabolomics analysis with a focus on changes in carbohydrates and lipids. These patients all had variable levels of intellectual disability except for one who had autism spectrum disorder; patients were a mix of verbal and non-verbal.,5d4e6788-e9a1-476c-b2f9-33bca9308f1c

During the 2nd sampling the patients were on 3:1 or 4:1 KD ratio (Table 1). All lumbar punctures were performed in the morning, around 8 AM, soon after breakfast. During both lumbar punctures, four mL cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected: samples with visible blood content were not used. Aliquots were immediately cold-centrifuged, supernatant collected, frozen, and stored at − 70 °C. Prior studies have shown that metabolites stored at this temperature are expected to remain stable for decades [32, 33].

9,methods5,"  The diet followed a standardized protocol for the classic KD, which is a slightly modified version of the protocol of the Johns Hopkins Hospital [34]. Most patients were started at a 4:1 (fats:(proteins + carbohydrates)) ratio. A minimum of 1 g/kg body weight per day of protein was used. At diet start supplements of vitamins and minerals were given to all patients as well as carnitine (100 mg/kg body weight per day). All calculations of the amount of calories and the nutrient composition of the menus of the diet were made for the individual child by a specially trained dietician.  The parents were educated on all aspects of the diet by a specialized dietician, neuropediatrician, and keto nurse during a 4–5 days inpatient stay at diet start. The parents were carefully instructed on the importance of being accurate in preparing the menus of the diet, and on keeping detailed diaries.",55cbd307-dab9-4231-a4ec-d69895777736
10,methods6," Dietary compliance was monitored by daily testing of urine ketones at home by parents with data reported to nurses, and also by blood testing for β-hydroxybutyrate during frequent visits with the diet team consisting of nurse, dietician and neuropediatrician. Members of the team had frequent (sometimes daily) telephone consultations with parents on how to manage the diet. Also, diaries were discussed with the team during clinic visits at 1 and 3 months of treatment. Medications were not changed during the study, with the exception of slight decreases in some children.

The ketone bodies acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate were increased many-fold, and although the ketone body acetone was not itself detected, its metabolite 1,2-propanediol [35] was detected and elevated significantly. There were large increases in trimethylamine N-oxide (a gut microbiotic metabolite of dietary carnitine and lecithin) and glycocholate (a gut microbiota-modified bile acid). There were decreases in methylmalonyl-carnitine (involved in fatty acid synthesis) and glycerol 3-phosphate (a triglyceride metabolite).

16,results5," Regarding compounds that were significantly changed in both patients with an optimal vs. no observable clinical response (e.g. hexanoyl- and acetyl-carnitine, 3-hydroxyoctanoate, trimethylamine N-oxide), examination of the fold changes in means reveals larger magnitude changes in optimal responders.  Not surprisingly, since a KD greatly reduces dietary carbohydrates, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sugars and their metabolites/derivatives during KD therapy changed greatly from baseline to during KD (Table 3). Some carbohydrates were decreased, including glucose (significant only in optimal responders) and the glycemic indicator 1,5-anhydroglucitol [36].

19,results9,"  Statistical analysis was further focused on the hallmark changes in biochemistry within the lipid and carbohydrate families, namely the ketone bodies and glucose. We applied two-by-two ANOVAs to these cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites with clinical response to KD and time as factors. There were no baseline differences between the groups (locants are overlapping in Fig. 1). As expected, ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) were elevated and glucose was lowered during KD treatment; however, all these responses were significantly smaller in the patients with no clinical response vs. those with optimal response (Fig. 1). Serum levels of β-hydroxybutyrate during KD were also significantly lower in patients with no clinical response (3.2 ± 0.4 mM) vs. those with optimal response (5.2 ± 0.1 mM, p < 0.01), expected as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ketone body levels track blood levels [38–42].Fig.",437e1eda-3895-4c5b-a486-a07bff762fd4

21,results11," In two patients, however, seizures came back during tapering: in one there are very few seizures but in the other the seizures were as bad as before KD. In the five patients with no seizure response, the diet was tapered after 3–4 months in three patients, but parents of two patients persevered with the KD because of improved communication and better alertness. Dietary treatment was continued for 2–3 years with these behavioral improvements persisting. ",d6176667-6c46-410b-9dc2-b0b06b6c081a
22,discussion0,"We characterized KD-induced changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lipid/carbohydrate metabolome in pediatric epilepsy patients with the most distinct clinical behavioral responses at 3 months: either no detectable seizures (optimal response) or no detectable change in the frequency of refractory seizures. A major finding from this analysis, supported by longitudinal and between-subjects analyses, is that those patients who had an optimal response had a stronger metabolic response to the KD than those patients who showed no seizure improvement. This effect was evident by a larger number of KD-changed compounds and a larger magnitude change in most of those compounds in optimal responders – including glucose and the ketone bodies. While this pattern might be interpreted to indicate that the patients with no clinical response were less compliant, there is some evidence to suggest this is not true. For example, diet compliance was described as good by caretakers and medical personnel.",daec2234-5ebc-4124-9f4a-3a715c83deb7
23,discussion1," Furthermore, all patients with no clinical response (as well those with optimal response) had striking elevations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ketone bodies during KD compared to pre-diet (and high blood ketone bodies during KD), confirming adherence to a KD that precipitated a shift to ketone-based metabolism. Thus, these differences may be due to inherent biological variability in metabolic response. We cannot rule out, however, that some external dietary factors (exact ratio of KD administered, types of fat or of protein, etc.) could be involved.  Of paramount interest is the identification of compounds that could be mechanistically involved in the anticonvulsant effect of a robust metabolic response. The eponymous products of a KD are an obvious candidate [14].",8be50bd2-3b78-4ca6-b779-db5557caf3e1
24,discussion2," Beyond being a more efficient fuel for in oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial health, ketone bodies are putative signaling molecules in several pathways that should improve the state of hyperexcitable brain tissue, including inhibitory ion channels [43], vesicular glutamate release [44], inflammation [45], nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidation state [46], and histone deacetylases [47]. It was realized in the earliest KD studies that some threshold level of blood ketone bodies needed to be reached for beneficial outcomes [48, 49]. Beyond that, however, the connection of elevated blood ketone bodies and anticonvulsant effects clinically has been controversial, described as correlated [50–52] or not [53]. Studies have noted that some individual patients benefit despite not being in ketosis [54–56] or have described a correlation only at certain lengths of KD treatment [55, 57].",18d0386e-4ab9-426d-82d4-cd5ade51ab2e
25,discussion3,"  Besides elevating brain ketone body levels via the liver, low glucose appears to have direct effects in brain. Mildly lowered glucose promotes an autocrine inhibition in pyramidal neurons in vitro based on the neuromodulator adenosine [58]. This same mechanism is invoked by KD treatment [59] and is anti-seizure [60]. Similarly, partial block of glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose tempers epileptiform activity in vitro [61] and seizures in vivo in some models [62]. Low glycemic index diets can be anticonvulsant in the absence of ketosis [63, 64], and low glucose rather than elevated ketone bodies seems to underlie the anticonvulsant action of caloric restriction [65]. At the other end of the glycolytic pathway, elevated pyruvate was significant in optimal responders only, which may indicate decreased usage due to increased acetyl-CoA production from ketone bodies.  Acetyl-carnitine, associated with dietary red meat [28] is involved in synthesis of acetyl-CoA.",d977e525-0617-4208-8b46-3a5292988866
26,discussion4," Although little work has been done with seizures directly [66], this molecule is thought to be neuroprotective, neurotrophic, and antioxidant. Notably, acetyl-carnitine is well-tolerated as a dietary supplement [67].  Conversely, this metabolomics analysis revealed some elevated compounds that may be mechanistically detrimental to the efficacy of a KD. KD-related elevations in fructose and sorbose occur in patients with no clinical response and not those with optimal response. Because fructose and sorbose can be metabolized to fructose-6-phosphate, these KD-related changes could augment glycolytic metabolites downstream of glucose. Combined with a smaller reduction in glucose itself in patients with no clinical response, this pattern might indicate that substantial amounts of acetyl-coA are still entering the Kreb’s cycle from the glycolytic pathway.",e56aa860-ba94-4d88-af06-2e7192698a83
27,discussion5," This state may offset the enhanced efficiency of adenosine triphosphate production during ketolysis, undermining the beneficial effects of the KD-related metabolic state presumably occurring with full force in optimal responders.  Many detected compounds likely reflect a stronger metabolic response to the KD in optimal responders without being mechanistically involved in a better anticonvulsant response. For instance, increases in trimethylamine N-oxide is to be expected in a diet rich in meat, fish, and eggs; changes in glycocholate and methylmalonyl carnitine comport with a high fat diet; decreased glycerol 3-phosphate could be due to increased shunting into glycolysis (via dihydroxyacetone phosphate) to augment this underpowered pathway – none of these metabolites are thought to have signaling properties in brain. 3-hydroxyoctanoate is a signaling molecule with specific receptors expressed in adipocytes but not brain [68].",ee328cbf-cf42-4931-a996-036fa5ca1e25
28,discussion6," γ-hydroxybutyrate also acts on specific receptors (GPR172A), and is used exogenously as an abused hypnotic/sedative drug. However, antagonism of GPR172A is anticonvulsant; conversely, activation is used to produce an animal model of absence seizures [69] making higher γ-hydroxybutyrate unlikely to be involved in a better anticonvulsant response to the KD. It was hypothesized that elevated β-hydroxybutyrate might mediate the mild euphoria found during fasting and sometimes during KD [70] by acting pharmacologically like γ-hydroxybutyrate; however, elevated γ-hydroxybutyrate itself may underlie this effect.  These findings can be related to prior clinical studies of the plasma metabolome, and some changes found in plasma were not present in these cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. For instance, KD did not elevate cortisol in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), whereas it has been reported to do so in plasma; these latter studies were, however, in rheumatoid arthritis patients [19, 53].",4d722318-43f9-44a3-9c20-55d2903dd96f
29,discussion7," Cappuccio et al. reported elevated plasma hydroxybutyryl- and acetyl-carnitine and lower methylmalonyl-carnitine in KD-treated glucose transporter 1 deficient patients [16], similar to the present results. Also, Schoeler et al. demonstrated a stronger β-hydroxybutyrate response to KD treatment in patients with optimal clinical response vs. those with no response; however, they also reported that optimal responders had higher baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-hydroxybutyrate and octanoyl- and acetyl-carnitine [21]. We did not replicate those findings, and in fact showed a trend for lower initial acetyl-carnitine in optimal responders (and a significant increase during KD was also specific to optimal responders – showing a strong regulation by KD). These discrepancies could be due to true differences between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or might reflect dissimilar definitions of patients with optimal response or no clinical response.",b21abfde-9ea2-48fc-ad40-b120ec0ef1ec
30,discussion8,"  We acknowledge some limitations to the present study. The number of subjects is low, which reduces statistical power. Also, we are unaware of any clinical study that describes effects of the presently-used anticonvulsants on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of our metabolites of interest, so if and how these drugs had any effect remains unknown. Last, metabolomics was not performed on plasma, which was collected but lost in a freezer accident. This could have indicated correlations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma and possibly identified blood-born predictors of clinical response.  Conclusions In a small but valuable clinical cohort with pre- and post-KD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling, we found a more effective anticonvulsant response correlated with a stronger central metabolic response at 3 months of KD treatment.",a9a66296-c444-43bc-afa0-7c8e8528ab0d
31,discussion9," Such samples present a special opportunity as studies with sequential lumbar punctures in pediatric patients are rare, but allow for within-subjects analysis. This study extends and complements prior work on monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitters in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [22, 23]. Focused studies of specific metabolites are valuable, but the unpredicted changes found here (such as KD-elevated levels of hexoses only in non-reponders) highlight the importance of casting a wide net. Further work is needed and could determine more quantitatively if a strong central metabolic response early in KD treatment predicts an ultimately effective anticonvulsant outcome, information that may be useful in decisions about treatment adjuvants, adjustments and/or continuation. In addition, a blood-based correlate that predicts efficacy would be extremely valuable because cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection is necessarily invasive.",5e9e5907-2e04-4e5f-81ef-32ea7eecacda
32,discussion10," It is worth noting that some of the relevant metabolites (ketone bodies, 1,2-propanediol, glycerol 3-phosphate) are detectable with 1H or 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. For those whose poor anticonvulsant response may due to inherent biological factors, on possibility is that KD treatment could be amplified by manipulating hallmark metabolic changes directly – for example supplementing with relevant molecules, e.g. ketone bodies (via precursors such as ketone esters, medium chain triglycerides, or coconut oil) or acetyl-carnitine.",83a6d1fc-ad9f-430b-935d-cd1c040a2576
