0,introduction0,"Skeletal muscle comprises 40% of the body mass and it functions in locomotion, postural support, glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation. Skeletal muscle consists of distinct fast-twitch glycolytic and slow-twitch oxidative fibers. Balanced muscle protein synthesis and degradation can retain skeletal muscle mass and muscle performance. Muscle protein metabolism varies according to nutritional and environmental circumstances. It increases in response to food intake, exercise and anabolic hormones such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and decreases in response to starvation, aging, muscle disuse, loss of neural input, cancer and catabolic hormones such as glucocorticoid (GC)1.  The physiological and molecular events that occur in rodents deprived of food for 24–48 h have been determined in a study of the mechanism of muscle mass loss2.",6a12608b-7ebb-4d7e-b758-88f531f4fe18
1,introduction1," Total food deprivation suppresses insulin secretion and increases GC production, then activates muscle protein catabolism to release alanine and other amino acids as a source of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Increased fatty acid oxidation leads to the production of ketone bodies. Depriving rodents of food also induces hyperactivity. Impaired insulin signaling and an increase in endogenous GC could trigger the degradation of skeletal muscle proteins by activating the ubiquitin-proteasome (ubiquitin proteasome (UPS)) and autophagy systems3. The fast-twitch fibers in the gastrocnemius (Ga) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles are more sensitive to atrophy induced by fasting than slow-twitch fibers3 possibly because they are prone to GC-induced muscle atrophy4,5. The stimulation of these proteolytic systems is mediated through increased expression of the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1)6–10, as well as autophagy11.",5a060d0f-cf08-4b14-a2a8-a23054e63c17
2,introduction2," Activation of these muscle atrophy-related genes is regulated by GC-regulated transcription factors such as glucocorticoid receptor (GR)8,10,12, FOXOs11 and KLF1513. However, these molecular events might be transient in rodents that have fasted for 24–48 h and might not accurately reflect the effects of chronically poor nutrition. In fact, the amount of total muscle proteolysis varies daily in humans deprived of food3. Furthermore, Lange et al. sequentially analyzed skeletal muscle in rats after a 48-h fast and identified a rapid, transient starvation signal. The intramuscular AMP/ATP ratio, an indicator of cellular energy status, significantly increased from ~1.5- to 12.5-fold between 6 and 24 h, respectively, then started to decrease at 48 h but remained ~5-fold higher than that of non-fasted mice14. The phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) also transiently increased at 6 and 12 h, then returned to baseline at 48 h.",580e9c3c-5bf8-43ba-8f78-50d2b1b38d1a
3,introduction3," These results suggest that intracellular energy status remarkably varies after a short fast. We consider that muscle-wasting is caused by chronic and mild malnutrition rather than fasting in humans. Thus, experimental food withdrawal is limited as an animal model of the effects of chronically poor nutritional status on skeletal muscle.  Ketogenic diets (KD) comprising high-fat, low-carbohydrate and protein contents have been included in weight loss strategies for both obese and non-obese individuals. Such diets mimic the metabolic status of fasting or caloric restriction and are based on theoretical concepts of the effects of dietary component ratios on energy expenditure15. The present study aimed to determine degrees of muscle atrophy in mice fed with a KD. ",dde3dc8a-2556-4f13-9b50-f028f2d13df4

The KD increased LC3-II values and KD plus colchicine increased them above that observed with KD alone or with ND plus colchicine in Ga and TA muscles (Fig. 8). The KD alone increased LC3-II values in Sol muscles, but adding colchicine did not increase the intensity of LC3-II band. We found that colchicine increased p62 in the Ga and TA, but not in the Sol muscles of both groups of mice.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 plays a key role in muscle hypertrophy20. In accordance with plasma IGF-1 values (Fig. 2h), the mRNA expression of Igf1 was decreased by 30% in the Ga and Sol muscles, and by 58% in the TA muscles of mice fed with the KD (Fig. 10a). Myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD1) is a major transcription factor that mediates the transactivation of myofibrillar genes such as myosin heavy chain and skeletal α-actin21–23. The mRNA expression of Myod1 was significantly decreased in the Ga and TA muscles of mice fed with the KD, but essentially identical in the Sol muscles of mice fed with the KD and the ND (Fig. 10b).

26,discussion0,"Chronically poor nutritional status accompanied by anorexia is considered to be a factor that causes muscle atrophy under pathological conditions such as sarcopenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), cancer cachexia, and anorexia nervosa25,26. Food has been withdrawn from experimental animal models in efforts to elucidate the molecular basis of short-term starvation. However, these studies were more focused on acute and transient responses of skeletal muscles. Here, we created a new experimental model of starvation-induced muscle wasting, by feeding mice with a KD. This model allowed evaluation of the chronic effects of starvation on muscle atrophy, unlike the conventional model in which food is withdrawn for only 24–48 h to ensure the welfare of rodents24.",5bf5487a-0a0b-4676-ba7b-6a26cb7ce7a5
27,discussion1," Consuming a KD decreases circulating levels of albumin, glucose and insulin, and increases ketone bodies and free fatty acids (FFA), indicating that consuming a KD modeled persistent starvation in which the primary fuel source shifts from glucose to ketones generated by free fatty acids (FFA) oxidation. The KD caused the loss of muscle mass accompanied by decreased plasma insulin and IGF-1 and increased plasma corticosterone values, then upregulated GR-target ubiquitin ligases and autophagy marker genes in the Ga, TA and Sol muscles. Hu et al. reported that the stimulation of muscle proteolysis requires increased endogenous GC and impaired insulin signaling27. The attenuation of IGF-1 signaling also accelerates muscle atrophy20. In vivo autophagy flux assay revealed that KD mainly activated autophagy in the Ga muscle.",0d83f3fd-357f-48c1-a3f7-dcb98daee2e2
28,discussion2," Based on these findings, we concluded that hypercorticosteronemia and hypoinsulinemia, along with decreased IGF-1 secretion induced by the KD, resulted in muscle atrophy via autophagy, particularly in the Ga muscle. On the other hand, expression of the antioxidant genes Sod1, Gclc, Hmox1 and Cat was upregulated in the Ga, TA and Sol muscles, suggesting that the KD caused ROS generation; nonetheless, the antioxidant system in skeletal muscles remained relatively intact. Although the molecular mechanism remains unknown, the KD downregulated mRNA expression of the muscle anabolism-related genes, Igf1 and Col1a2, indicating a decline in muscle anabolism. SUnSET analyses confirmed that the KD suppressed muscle protein synthesis in all muscles evaluated. These finding suggest that suppressed protein synthesis contributed to KD-induced muscle atrophy in the TA and Sol, whereas accelerated autophagy and reduced protein synthesis synergistically induced atrophy in the Ga muscle.",510e2a53-4c1e-47a2-89de-cc91c5bfe8d9

30,discussion4,"    In addition to hypercorticosteronemia, we postulated that oxidative stress contributes to muscle atrophy in mice fed with a KD. The expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes was increased by the KD, although whether a KD causes oxidative stress remains controversial28. We measured 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (hydroxy 2 nonenal (HNE))-conjugated cytosolic protein as an indicator of lipid peroxidation and found that 4-hydroxy 2 nonenal (HNE) levels were essentially identical between ND and KD mice (Supplementary Fig. 1). An activated antioxidant system could improve the mitochondrial redox state after consuming a KD. Further studies are needed to confirm the involvement of ROS production on muscle atrophy caused by a KD.  The weight of the TA did not significantly differ between mice fed with the ND or the KD, although gene expression was similar among all muscles evaluated. We found that hypercorticosteronemia contributes to the induction of muscle atrophy while on a KD.",fe527e7c-e4ec-4e9a-8acb-3981e1ade37f
31,discussion5," The TA muscles comprise fast twitch-muscle fibers that are sensitive to GC-induced muscle wasting. We speculate that an unidentified mechanism contributes to the maintenance of TA weight, although this awaits confirmation.  The KD increased levels of the circulating ketone, β-hydroxybutyrate. This metabolic substrate works not only to produce energy during prolonged fasting, but also as a signaling molecule. It is an endogenous and specific inhibitor of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), it promotes the hyperacetylation of histone proteins and contributes to an open chromatin environment that leads to induction of the transcription factor FOXO329. Activated FOXO might accelerate the upregulation of Mafbx and Murf1 mRNA during KD consumption.  Calorie intake could not account for the decrease in BW on day 3. Depleted hepatic and muscle glycogen stores along with associated bound water are thought to decrease BW during the initial phase of extreme carbohydrate restriction15.",d727c5b4-6789-4d1e-8d5d-f31c792b0f1c
32,discussion6," We postulated that the depletion of glycogen stores decreased the amount of water stored with glycogen, resulting in increased water excretion and a loss of BW at the initial phase of KD consumption in our model mice.  The KD reduced plasma IGF-1 levels in the present study. A growth hormone (GH)-GH receptor cascade positively regulates Igf1 mRNA transcription30. Reports have indicated that GH values are normal31 or elevated32, whereas circulating IGF-1 levels are reduced in rodents fed with a KD31. Our findings were similar to these. The KD might have caused GH resistance33 which could have been responsible for the IGF-1 reduction. Further studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the IGF-1 reduction in mice fed with a KD.  A KD is of interest to humans because it has been applied as a weight-loss strategy15 and to treat epilepsy34.",ce34d244-e895-4ed1-ba62-44e29c5767e2
33,discussion7," However, skeletal muscle physiology might be at risk due to hypercorticosteronemia, hypoinsulinemia, decreased IGF-1 secretion and an oxidized redox environment associated with chronic KD consumption. However, little is known about the adverse effects of a KD on skeletal muscle.  Alanine released from skeletal muscle during starvation in response to increased protein degradation for hepatic gluconeogenesis results in a decrease in muscle mass16. Dyar et al. identified increased serum alanine values in mice fed with a high-fat diet for 10 weeks, possibly via muscle proteolysis35. However, they noted that serum creatinine was increased on the high-fat diet, indicating that muscle mass was maintained and that rates of protein turnover increased35. The present study found lower plasma alanine levels in mice fed with the KD, compared with the ND, suggesting the slow release of amino acids from skeletal muscle or accelerated hepatic gluconeogenesis and alanine consumption.",03ebd8aa-cb5d-4cdd-98da-15cb30eeb1af
34,discussion8," Plasma alanine levels are lower in patients with chronically poor nutrition, such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)36, as well as in aged mice37, although the mechanism remains obscure. A KD might replicate the slower protein degradation associated with chronically poor nutrition. When food is unavailable, experimental animals become hyperactive for food. Mice become hyperactive after one or two days on a KD, whereas chronic continuous KD consumption gradually decreases locomotor activity and body temperature38. Based on these facts, physiological adaptation to a KD might somewhat resemble the chronically poor nutritional status associated with aging and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Table 1).",b1207ae1-4aaa-4fab-9bb8-fccac0b96ed7
35,discussion9," Although poor nutritional status shares some features with acute forms of muscle atrophy caused by food withdrawal, sciatic denervation and synthetic GC administration, food withdrawal from experimental animals is of limited value to understanding the effects of chronic poor nutritional status on skeletal muscle. Feeding experimental animals with a KD is a novel model of starvation, which might more closely resemble the chronically poor nutrition associated with conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and anorexia, as well as aging.Table 1 Comparison of ketogenic diet consumption with other animal models of skeletal muscle atrophy.",ee51346c-a008-4897-9d99-c8a915911098
