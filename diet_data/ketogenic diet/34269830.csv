0,methods0," 4.1. Ethics Statement  This study was approved by the local ethics committee (Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy), protocol P/740/CE/2012.  Written, informed consent was provided by all the subjects, and all experiments were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki—Ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects.  4.2. Patients’ Samples: Study Design and Participants  Human blood plasma samples were collected in accordance with ethical guidelines and approved standard clinical protocols after overnight fasting. EDTA plasma was prepared via 10 min of centrifugation at 4 °C and 3000 g. We evaluated 20 hypogonadal male patients and 20 age- and BMI-matched controls (Table 1). All subjects enrolled were informed about the study protocol and gave their written consent. The diagnosis of hypogonadism was based on the presence of clinical symptoms related to this condition (e.g.",5acfa8ea-a61f-4d74-9b58-57fe6c2c2b56
1,methods1,", delayed sexual development, reduced libido, or erectile dysfunction) and on the results of standard hormonal exams (total testosterone < 8 nmol/L). The patients affected by hypogonadism were only included if they had HOMAi > 2.5. The participants in the control group were healthy males who were referred to the Outpatient Clinic of Endocrinology and Metabolism for check-ups.  4.3. Study Treatment  The study was carried out at Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy. Twenty healthy men and twenty men with hypogonadism diagnosed using both clinical symptoms of hypogonadism, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and/or decreased energy, as well as evidence of low serum T (≤8 nmol/L) were enrolled in our study. The hypogonadal patients were treated with testosterone preparation Gel 2%. The gel was formulated to have a similar application and appearance. Serum testosterone concentrations were measured at 60 days.",15c12441-f23c-4212-af11-41aa2e9a1d41
2,methods2," All patients gave their informed consent before participating in the study.  4.4. Plasma Collection and Metabolite Extraction  Metabolites were extracted by adding 200 µl of each plasma sample to 600 µL of cold (−20 °C) chloroform: methanol: water (1:3:1 ratio). Samples were vortexed for 1 min and left on ice for 2 h for complete protein precipitation. The solutions were then centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000× g.  4.5. ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)  Twenty microliters of extracted plasma were injected into an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)) system (Ultimate 3000, Thermo) and run in positive mode. Samples were loaded onto a Reprosil C18 column (2.0 mm × 150 mm, 2.5 μm—Dr Maisch, Germany) for metabolite separation. Chromatographic separations were achieved at a column temperature of 30 °C and flow rate of 0.2 mL/min.",b4a5edb1-a4df-44cb-979d-0065505fc32e
3,methods3," For positive ion mode (+) MS analyses, a 0–100% linear gradient of solvent A (ddH2O, 0.1% formic acid) to B (acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) was employed over 20 min, returning to 100% A in 2 min and a 6 min post-time solvent A hold. Acetonitrile, formic acid, and HPLC-grade water and standards (≥98% chemical purity) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system was coupled online with a mass spectrometer Q Exactive (Thermo) scanning in full MS mode (2 μscans) at 70,000 resolutions in the 67 to 1000 m/z range, with a target of 1106 ions, a maximum ion injection time (IT) of 35 ms, 3.8 kV spray voltage, 40 sheath gas, and 25 auxiliary gas, operated positive ion mode. Source ionization parameters were spray voltage, 3.8 kV; capillary temperature, 300 °C; and S-Lens level, 45.",5f63b643-de52-4c31-a11a-df5b83835bee
4,methods4," Calibration was performed before each analysis against positive- or negative-ion-mode calibration mixes (Piercenet, Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL, USA) to ensure sub-ppm error of the intact mass. Metabolite assignments were performed using computer software (Maven, 18 Princeton, NJ, USA) upon the conversion of raw files into the mzXML format through MassMatrix (Cleveland, OH, USA).  4.6. Metabonomic Data Processing and Statistical Analysis  Raw files of replicates were exported, converted into the mzXML format through MassMatrix (Cleveland, OH, USA), and then processed using MAVEN software (http://maven.princeton.edu/) (accessed on 1 April 2013). Mass spectrometry chromatograms were elaborated for peak alignment, the matching and comparison of parent and fragment ions, and tentative metabolite identification (within a 2 ppm mass-deviation range between observed and expected results against the imported KEGG database).",dc6df28a-9926-453e-a973-548f556b7eb9
5,methods5," To further explore the metabolic differences between the two groups of subjects, multivariate statistical analyses were employed on an MS data set consisting of 20 hypogonadal men pre- and post-treatment. Multivariate statistical analyses were performed on the entire metabonomic data set using the MetaboAnalyst 3.0 software, which also enabled an overview of the data variance structure in an unsupervised manner. Before the analysis, raw data were normalized by median and auto-scaling to increase the importance of low-abundance ions without the significant amplification of noise. The web- based tools MSEA (Metabolite Set EnrichmentAnalysis) and MetPA (Metabolomic Pathway Analysis), which are incorporated into the MetaboAnalyst platform, were used to perform metabolite enrichment and pathway analyses, respectively. Data for metabolites detected in all samples were submitted into MSEA and MetPA with annotation based on common chemical names.",12e907a4-c5ea-4032-b04e-e12c7ea3b10c
6,methods6," Accepted metabolites were verified manually using HMDB, KEGG, and PubChem DBs. A Homo sapiens pathway library was used for pathway analysis. Global test was the selected pathway enrichment analysis method, whereas the node importance measure for topological analysis was the relative betweenness centrality. For MSEA metabolites, data were mapped according to HMDB, and the “metabolite pathway associated metabolites set” library (currently 88 entries) was chosen for the enrichment analysis, which was performed using the package global test. The results were graphed with Graphpad Prism 5.01 (Graphpad SoftwareInc) (CA, USA). Statistical analyses were performed with the same software. Data are presented as mean ± SEM of fold-change relative to the metabolite levels in controls. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 and further stratified to p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively.  5.",8435587d-0ae4-4cf3-815d-5dfd501045f2
7,methods7," Conclusions  In conclusion, our investigation confirms that in insulin-resistant hypogonadism, testosterone therapy does not re-establish complete metabolism restoration. At present, we cannot exclude the fact that those 60 days of Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) are not sufficient; further research would need to be conducted to investigate this. Longer treatment times are most likely necessary to re-establish complete metabolism restoration, although insulin resistance cannot improve with Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), which is at the heart of the complications observed. Our investigations revealed that upon the application of common testosterone therapy, it is beneficial to add supplementary biochemical markers which were not restored by Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) to obtain a better wellness recovery, such as carnosine, acetylcarnitine, leucine, and isoleucine.",828b99bb-44c9-47e3-8b33-40b303789a14
8,methods8," Regarding the new symptoms observed after Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), they could be managed by the assumption of remedies proposed for ‘keto flu’ [49], such as an increase in sodium intake supplements with electrolytes, drinking broth (including bone broth and stock cubes), increasing magnesium, increasing potassium, increasing dietary fats (including avocado, monocarboxylate transporter (MCT), olives, butter, nuts, and fat bombs), and increasing water intake.
