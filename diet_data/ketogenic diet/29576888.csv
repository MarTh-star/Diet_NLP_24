0,methods0,"2.1. Ethics Human tumors were obtained from the Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Salzburg. The study was performed according to the Austrian Gene Technology Act. Experiments were conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 (revised 2013) and the guidelines of the local ethics committee, being no clinical drug trial or epidemiological investigation. All patients signed an informed consent document concerning the surgical intervention. Furthermore, the study did not extend to the examination of individual case records. Patient anonymity was ensured at all times. All analyses on human CCC samples were approved by the local ethics committee (415-EP/73/37-2011).  2.2. Samples To evaluate differences in expression between malignant and corresponding normal tissue, we constructed a tissue microarray (tissue microarray (TMA)) of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)) tissue blocks from 34 individuals with CCC.",46817002-989c-424c-9ef7-ec612d1a16d8
1,methods1," Three punches of each individual were analyzed: the tumor center, the tumor periphery, and the adjacent normal tissue. Samples were analyzed by two professional pathologists and the mean values were taken for statistics.  2.3. Clinical Parameters The following clinical parameters were evaluated: age, sex, overall survival from the day of diagnosis, localization (intrahepatic, perihilar, extrahepatic), growth type (mass forming, periductal, intraductal), tumor size, TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification, metastasis, UICC (Union Internationale Contre le Cancer), grading, etiology (Table S1).  2.4. Immunohistochemical Staining of org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) Complex Subunits and VDAC1 (Porin) of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) Tissues All primary antibodies (Table 1) were diluted in Dako antibody diluent with background-reducing components (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark).",4bed472e-c8a6-4e13-9663-80c556c76a26
2,methods2," Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously [20]. For antigen retrieval, the sections were immersed for 45 min in 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 8, at 95 °C. Tissue sections were incubated for 30 min with the above-listed primary antibodies (Table 1).  2.5. Statistical Analysis For comparison of tumors and normal adjacent tissue, a t-test was applied. For multiple comparisons, one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction were applied. The Pearson correlation was applied to analyze potential associations between the evaluated parameters. For analysis of survival, Kaplan–Meier curves were used.  3. Results 3.1. Immunohistochemical (IHC) Scoring Staining intensities were rated using a scoring system ranging from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating no staining, 1 being mild, 2 moderate, and 3 strong staining. Score values were obtained by multiplying the staining intensity by the percentage of positive cells. The percentage of positive cells was analyzed with 10% increments.",0fd877ce-2d9f-46ec-a2c3-5c83328f0e95
3,methods3, For 10–20% of positive cells a median value of 15% was used for statistics. Examples for immunohistochemical scorings are shown in Figure 1.  3.2. Expression of VDAC1 and Subunits of the Five org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) Complexes VDAC1 was used as a marker for the mitochondrial mass. It is highly expressed in the outer mitochondrial membrane which is otherwise relatively sparse of proteins. Therefore it represents the gold standard for determination of the mitochondrial amount. Protein complexes of the org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane where they transport electrons to generate a proton gradient used by the ATP synthase (complex V) to make ATP.,6e5122e7-d62b-4d24-8ad8-ad40cb5e1346
4,methods4," Subunits for each of the five org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes were analyzed in CCCs. Complex I (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) coenzyme Q oxidoreductase) is the largest multisubunit complex of the org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system with a molecular mass of 970 kDa consisting of 45 subunits [21,22]. NDUFS4 is an iron–sulfur cluster-containing subunit incorporated during a very late stage of complex I assembly essential for complex I function. Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) is the smallest complex consisting of four subunits and the only complex exclusively encoded by the nuclear DNA. Complex III (coenzyme Q: cytochrome c-oxidoreductase) consists of 22 subunits. Cytochrome b is the only mtDNA-encoded subunit of complex III [23].",6ae6c72e-1f03-472b-b087-bf613d0f4a04
5,methods5," Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) represents the last complex of the respiratory chain catalyzing the terminal step in reduction O2. Three complex IV subunits are encoded by mtDNA. Complex V (ATP synthase) uses the protons translocated by the respiratory chain enzymes for production of ATP [23,24]. Complex I, complex III, and complex IV are furthermore organized in even bigger protein complexes, of which the most abundant one is termed respirasome [25].  Significantly higher VDAC1 expression was observed in the tumor center compared to adjacent normal tissue (p < 0.0001) (Figure 1A–C, Figure 2A,C and Figure 3A).  VDAC1 levels in the tumor periphery were similar to those in normal tissue and significantly lower than in the tumor center (p < 0.001) (Figure 1A–C and Figure 3A). NDUFS4 (subunit of complex I) expression did not differ between normal tissue and the tumor center or the periphery (Figure 2 and Figure 3B).",f6f60ca9-8d8c-47d8-a5d7-c2b7adb7a573
6,methods6," SDHA (subunit of complex II) levels were significantly lower in the tumor periphery than in the tumor center (p < 0.05) and in adjacent normal tissue (p < 0.001) (Figure 1D–F and Figure 3C). No significant difference was detected between the tumor center and normal tissue (Figure 1D,E). UQCRC2 (subunit of complex III) expression was lower in the periphery compared to the control tissue (p < 0.01) (Figure 3D). MT-CO1 (subunit of complex IV) protein levels were significantly reduced in both the center (p < 0.0001) and periphery (p < 0.001) of the tumors compared to normal tissue (Figure 3E). Finally, ATP5F1A (subunit of complex V/ATP synthase) was significantly diminished in the tumor periphery (p < 0.001) and showed a trend to lower levels in the center, compared to controls (Figure 3F).",f4d7a0b3-fb39-44c3-b8be-bc76bba59fc5
7,methods7,"   Areas with cells negative for one or more org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits were found in both tumors and normal tissue (Figure 2D–F,M–O): 3% (tumor center), 21% (tumor periphery), and 25% (normal tissue) of the cases showed a loss of VDAC1 in more than 30% of the analyzed cells; 43% (tumor center), 60% (tumor periphery), and 35% (normal tissue) of the cases showed a loss of NDUFS4 (Figure 2F); 30% (tumor center), 54% (tumor periphery), and 11% (normal tissue) showed a loss of SDHA; 34% (tumor center), 54% (tumor periphery), and 10% (normal tissue) showed a loss of UQCRC2; 45% (tumor center) (Figure 2O), 41% (tumor periphery), 0% (normal tissue) showed a loss of MT-CO1; and 23% (tumor center), 30% (tumor periphery), and 0% (normal tissue) showed a loss of ATP5F1A.   3.3.",73ba21d8-4552-4414-a5bc-54016daec05e
8,methods8, Associations between org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) Subunit and VDAC1 Expression and Clinical Outcome A significant inverse correlation between the percentage of VDAC1-positive cells and MT-CO1-negative cells was detected (p = 0.0093). A significant inverse correlation was found between VDAC1 score values and UICC stage (p = 0.0065; R = −0.4855) (Table 2).  VDAC1 levels in the tumor center were lower in cases with lymph node involvement (p = 0.0201). The tumor periphery showed a similar trend (mean score values N0 = 162 ± 31 versus N1 = 147 ± 46). The same trend was present when metastasis occurred in the tumor center (mean score value for M0 = 229 ± 54; mean score value for M1 = 186 ± 48) (Table 3). No differences were observed in the tumor periphery with respect to M stage. Significantly lower NDUFS4 levels were present in males compared to females (p = 0.0454).,b830f3ec-3b20-479e-9c77-4dd3e0b75bf6
9,methods9,"  We divided the cases into high/moderate and low expressors. High expressors were defined as having staining intensities above 2. Since, in general, the staining intensities were lower for NDUFS4 and MT-CO1, high expressors for these subunits were defined by staining intensities above 1.5. A significant difference (p < 0.05) in survival was observed between these groups (high/moderate vs. low expressors) for VDAC1 expression (Figure 4 and Figure 5).  No correlations were found between survival and expression of any of the markers of differentiation (epithelial: CK7, CK19; mesenchymal: vimentin), cell cycle proteins (p16, p27, p53 and Ki67) and org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that individuals with tumors with high VDAC1 expression (staining intensity > 2) had significantly reduced overall survival (p < 0.05) compared to low expressors (staining intensity ≤ 2).",cffdb1b9-3080-4cf4-a6d3-8a0e334418fc
10,methods10," None of the org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes was significantly associated with survival. Score values, extensities (percent positive/negative cells) and the intensities were used for the overall survival analysis. However, only the intensity of VDAC1 staining was associated with survival. Therefore, we suppose that the staining intensity might be an independent prognostic factor for CCCs indicating more an on–off-phenomenon than a gradient mechanism.   4. Discussion The analysis of the mutational landscape revealed that TP53, KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene), IDH1 (Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1), and PTEN (Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase and dual-specificity protein phosphatase) are the most frequently mutated genes in intrahepatic CCCs [26]. Numerous studies have shown that p53 is involved in the regulation of many reactions in energy metabolism.",8946159a-d5f9-45f1-b7d4-c510f4e5973c
11,methods11," p53 can be regarded as a master regulator of energy metabolism since it influences glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the pentose-phosphate pathway, mitochondrial org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and glutamine metabolism [27,28]. Mutations in the oncogene KRAS drive metabolic reprogramming through enhanced glucose uptake and regulation of glutamine metabolism [29]. Additionally, PTEN was shown to regulate several aspects of energy metabolism [30]. IDH1 catalyzes the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to yield α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Under hypoxic conditions, IDH1 catalyzes the reverse reaction of α-KG to isocitrate, which contributes to citrate production via glutaminolysis [31,32]. In the present study, the levels of SDHA, UQCRC2, MT-CO1 and ATP5F1A were significantly reduced in the tumor periphery compared to the control tissue.",572e00a8-3841-4780-b076-be88282fd4b9
12,methods12," Thus, genetic alterations of proteins influencing energy metabolism are clearly central to the pathogenesis of CCC.  Large areas of NDUFS4 negative cells were found in tumors and control tissue, suggesting that this is an early event in tumorigenesis. No patient had large negative regions of MT-CO1 or ATP5F1A in normal tissue. In addition, SDHA and UQCRC2 were affected in only 11% and 10% of the cases, respectively. Mitochondrial DNA was reported to be significantly mutated in CCCs [26,33]. This can partially explain the observed org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) defects in our sample cohort. Moreover, the heteroplasmy of mtDNA mutations might explain the heterogeneity of the org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunit expression [34].",811d3876-f406-40be-babf-7233a7116947
13,methods13," According to the COSMIC database, potentially pathogenic mutations in nuclear-encoded org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits are very rare events in CCCs. Therefore, it would be interesting to analyze the mutational landscape (TP53, KRAS, IDH1, PTEN) in relation to the expression of org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits. However, it was not possible to perform a detailed genetic analysis because this was a retrospective study using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)) tissue.  As we found differences in the expression levels between the tumor center and periphery, we hypothesize that within CCCs, several modes of energy generation coexist.",0a2aaff4-6336-46ec-ae91-19d166588a66
14,methods14," Tumor cells at the margin might be more dependent on glucose than tumor cells at the center, as indicated by the lower levels of org/licenses/by/4 0/) Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits in the latter. This could be attributable to the fact that newly generated tumor cells at the growth front might not be sufficiently supplied with oxygen, because the generation of new blood vessels requires time. However, this hypothesis is controversial because necrosis is often seen in the tumor center, which is at least partially attributed (in the literature) to low oxygen supply.  Mitochondrial mass was increased in the tumor center compared to adjacent normal tissue, as indicated by VDAC1 staining. A significant inverse correlation found between the percentage of VDAC1-positive cells and MT-CO1-negative cells suggests there may be compensatory upregulation of mitochondrial mass.",7e4b7876-b0a5-4c43-ad91-c22da0494c9e
15,methods15," This phenomenon is well described in individuals with mitochondrial disorders, who frequently have increased mitochondrial content, as indicated by citrate synthase activity, VDAC1 levels, and mtDNA copy number [35]. In addition, oncocytic tumors, which are characterized by complex I defects caused by pathogenic mutations in mtDNA-encoded subunits, show a very pronounced increase in mitochondrial mass [19,36]. In addition, mtDNA content and mass increase in the tumorigenic progression of normal endometrial tissue to hyperplastic tissue to cancerous tissue [37]. MtDNA mutations and deletions have been reported in endometrial tumors [38].  Another possibility is that tumor cells at the periphery might express different sets of proteins compared to tumor cells in the center. The intercellular or cell–cell lactate shuttle hypothesis proposes that lactate is generated and exported from one cell and taken up and utilized by another cell.",24779f94-0589-40aa-89df-e75dde2e58f1
16,methods16," This mechanism has been described for neurons and astrocytes [39].  A significant inverse correlation was found between VDAC1 expression and UICC tumor stage. This agrees with findings in the literature, and may be explained as follows: aggressive tumors that are highly dependent on glucose should potentially exhibit low mitochondrial mass. In support, we found that VDAC1 levels were lower in cases with lymph node involvement. The same trend to lower VDAC1 levels was also present if metastasis occurred. Significantly lower survival was observed for low/moderate VDAC1 expressors compared to high expressors. That is, lower mitochondrial mass was associated with shorter survival.  The clear association between energy metabolism and CCC development has important therapeutic implications.",a85b6598-57ea-401b-a679-d6feadb0dae1
17,methods17," CCCs might be susceptible to metabolic therapies such as the ketogenic (high-fat, low-carbohydrate) diet, which was recently shown to significantly inhibit tumor growth in numerous xenograft models and patients [40,41,42,43].
