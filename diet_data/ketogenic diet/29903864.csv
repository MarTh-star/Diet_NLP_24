0,methods0,"3.1. Cell Culture MDA-MB-468 cell line (ATCC, HTB-132) was used for the generation of breast cancer xenografts. Cells were cultivated in high glucose DMEM medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Vienna, Austria) and penicillin/streptomycin amphotericin B solution (Lonza, Cologne, Germany).  3.2. Animal Experiments All in vivo experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved for this study by the Salzburg Animal Care and Use Committee (20901-TVG/116/6-2016, approved on 19 September, 2016 for breast cancer and 20901-TVG/87/7-2014, approved on 28 July, 2014 for healthy animals). Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and care conformed to the Austrian Act on Animal Experimentation. All experiments were performed on female CD-1 nu/nu mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany), the animals were group-housed and had unlimited access to food and water.",b426cbcb-29ba-4cfc-b007-48f2e5fa6d3f
1,methods1," Xenografts were established as previously described [19,42]. Briefly, a suspension of 1.5 × 107 MDA-MB-468 cells in serum-free medium and matrigel (BD Biosciences, Austria) were injected into the right flank of 5- to 6-week-old mice.   As soon as tumor size reached 300–350 mm3 (i.e., 2–5 weeks after injection of tumor cells), mice were randomized into different dietary intervention groups (control (CTRL), long chain triglycerides (LCT)-medium chain triglyceride (MCT)8; n = 5–6) [19]. As mice are able to keep blood glucose levels and show lower ketosis on 2:1 to 4:1 diets, compared to humans, we decided to use an 8:1 diet in our mouse model, to reach at least a ketosis over 2 mmol/L. Dietary interventions were combined with oral metronomic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (CPA) (30 mg/kg). The healthy, 7 weeks old, mice were fed with the experimental diets (control (CTRL), long chain triglycerides (LCT)-medium chain triglyceride (MCT)8; Supplementary Table S2) [19,42].",d707cf0f-fe86-4880-a478-8b55a92b67e6
2,methods2," All animals were monitored twice a week for body weight using a digital scale. Blood glucose and ketone body (β-hydroxybutyrate) levels were monitored once a week using a specific enzyme-based kit (Precision Xceed, Abbott Laboratories, Vienna, Austria). Tumor volume was measured twice a week in the xenografts bearing mice, by using a caliper and calculating the volume according to the formula 4/3 Pi × d1/2 × d2/2 × d3/2 (d—dimension).  Breast cancer bearing mice were euthanized after 80 days of treatment, whereas healthy mice after 40 days. Therefore, mice were injected with 10 μL/g of anesthetic mix (ketamine 20.5 mg/mL, xylazine 5.4 mg/mL, acepromazine 270 μg/mL in saline solution), and after checking for absence of reflexes from the paw, heart puncture was performed. Mice were then immediately euthanized via head-neck dislocation.",fe3d1476-a31f-4f10-b1ad-2c3afec0f1fd
3,methods3," Blood was transferred into tubes (BD Microtainer® PSTTM LH tubes; BD Biosciences, Vienna, Austria) and plasma was collected as described in the manufacture’s protocol, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen [19,42].  3.3. Preparation of Plasma Samples Metabolites were extracted by adding 810 µL of ice-cold methanol (VWR, Rednor, Pennsylvania, USA), containing 10 µmol L−1 ethylparaben (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland), 2 µmol L−1 3-nitro-L-tyrosine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 4 µmol L−1 d4- succinate (Sigma-Aldrich) to 90 µL of plasma. The internal standards ethylparaben, 3-nitro-L-tyrosine and d4-succinate were used for quality control for the assessment of the system stability. Proteins were pelleted in a centrifuge (HERMLE, Wehingen, Germany) at 18,620 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at room temperature, followed by resuspension in 90 µL 50% methanol.  3.4.",c1d89325-3974-4366-8235-f9de6f728947
4,methods4," HPLC-MS Measurements An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)) system consisting of an Accela 1250 pump, a Column Oven 300 (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany), and an LC PAL DLW Option Autosampler with a 100 µL syringe (from CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Switzerland) was coupled to a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Model Q Exactive Plus; Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a heated electrospray ion source operating in the positive or negative ion mode. A quality control sample (pool) was generated by merging an aliquot (10 µL) of all samples included in the study. Prior to injection into the HPLC-MS system, samples and pools were diluted 1:5 with Millipore water for reversed phase mode and 1:3 with acetonitrile (VWR, Rednor, PA, USA) for hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) mode separation.",89521b2c-d10c-47a9-8be4-283cd6ae5e8d
5,methods5,"  Each sequence started with three blank runs, followed by three pool injections and finished with one pool and one blank run. In between, a blank run and a pool run were conducted after every third sample. Each sample was measured in four different selectivity and ionization mode combinations, which were RP—positive ionization, RP—negative ionization, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)—positive ionization, and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)—negative ionization, resulting in four data sets per study. For each combination an exclusion list of the 100 most abundant ions obtained from prior blank runs was generated, to avoid MS fragmentation of chemical or electronic noise signals.  For RP-HPLC separations, a 100 × 2.1 mm i.d. Hypersil Gold aQ column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) packed with 1.9 µm octadecyl silica particles was applied. For column protection, a 4.0 × 3.0 mm i.d.",a23d6d12-37d7-4a17-a064-ffb78efc6329
6,methods6," C18 Security Guard pre-column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was installed. In reversed phase mode, mobile phase A and B were Millipore water and acetonitrile, both containing 0.10% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). The HPLC method started with holding 100% A for 1.5 min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% B in 6.5 min. After washing for 2.0 min at 100% B, the column was re-equilibrated to starting conditions for 3.0 min, resulting in a total run time of 13.0 min.  hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)-HPLC separations were performed using a 150 × 2.0 mm i.d. Nucleodur hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), packed with 1.8 µm zwitterionic functionalized particles. Additionally, a 4.0 × 2.0 mm i.d. Nucleodur hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) 1.8 µm pre-column, also from Macherey-Nagel was applied to protect the column.",58ae9c7c-b7c2-48d6-9fa4-513de94e0a0f
7,methods7," In the hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) mode, mobile phase A contained 50 mM ammonium formate in 50% acetonitrile, while mobile phase B was 10 mM ammonium formate (Sigma-Aldrich) in 90% acetonitrile. After holding 100% B for 3.0 min a linear gradient to 100% A in 17.0 min was applied. The column was washed for 2.0 min at 100% A and re-equilibrated to starting conditions for 8.0 min, resulting in a total run time of 30.0 min.  In both modes a flow rate of 0.30 µL min−1 and an injection volume of 2.70 µL were applied. The column temperature was held constant at 30 °C. Apart from the run time of 13.0 min in RP mode and 30.0 min in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) mode, MS settings of the data-dependent Top 5 method were identical for both selectivity modes. Scan range and resolution of MS1 scans were set to 80–850 m/z and 70,000, respectively, using an AGC target of 1 × 106 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms.",809c3d31-9ef5-4039-a5cf-2f42ba2a2d4e
8,methods8," The five most abundant ions of the MS1 scan were isolated with an isolation window of 0.8 m/z, fragmented via HCD applying stepped normalized collision energies of 20, 40, 60 and acquired in centroid mode. The maximum injection time was set to 64 ms with an AGC target of 5 × 104 at a resolution of 17,500. In addition to an exclusion of charges greater than two, dynamic exclusion of 5.0 s was used, in order to avoid multiple fragmentations of the same ions. Using these settings, all samples were measured in the positive and negative ionization mode in separated sequences for each selectivity and ionization mode. Tune parameters were a capillary temperature of 320 °C, a probe heater temperature of 350 °C and an S-lens level of 50 for both ionization modes. Differing settings were a sprayer voltage of 4.0 and 3.5 kV, sheath gas flow rate of 35 and 45, as well as an auxiliary gas flow rate of 5 and 10 in positive and negative ionization mode, respectively.  3.5.",6ea87401-2653-4f85-87a5-2bb30472665b
9,methods9," Data Evaluation Acquired raw files were converted to mzML files using the MSConvert tool of the ProteoWizard software (version 3.0.8688). Metabolomics data have been deposited to the EMBL-EBI MetaboLights database [60] with the identifier MTBLS1066. The complete dataset can be accessed here https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1066. The resulting files were further processed using a bioinformatic workflow in the Konstanz Information Miner (Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME)) [61], version 3.3.4 with integrated OpenMS 2.1.0 software [33] (see Supplementary Tables S3–S7 for detailed settings). The applied Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME) workflow can be accessed here https://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/5109.html.",02b7cc91-0cdf-4920-a094-0572271020a5
10,methods10," After peak picking, feature detection and feature alignment, data was filtered, normalized, and statistically evaluated using Linear Models for Microarray Data (Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA)) [43] followed by Benjamini–Hochberg correction [44] for multiple testing.   The metabolomics (MTX) study design and data treatment involved stringent filtering of “noise” signals or such originating from the chemical background, which enabled the reduction of chemical and electronic artefacts. Along that line, the HPLC-MS signals were aligned retention time wise, followed by exclusion of features that did not exceed a threshold of fivefold the median intensity of the corresponding signal in the blank from further data processing. In the next step, data was normalized via a robust regression, as explained in [27] to account for variations occurring during sample preparation and measurement.",c900230e-aba2-46f5-a462-2a7a7d7e8501
11,methods11," Features showing instable signals in the quality control runs and those not being present in a sufficient number of replicates or treatment conditions were removed. Filtering was based on peak area threshold in blank runs, as well as on relative standard deviation in quality control samples and occurrence in biological replicates.  Identification was done in a multiple step approach: (1) Monoisotopic mass search in the HMDB [45]; (2) molecular structure database search using SIRIUS in combination with CSI:FingerID [33,34,35,36]; (3) manual fragment spectra search using METLIN for all signals that resulted in a hit after step 1, but not after step 2 [37]; (4) verification of database hits via comparison of retention time and fragment spectra of reference standards. For detailed settings of the applied software used for identification see Supplementary Tables S8 and S9. Principal component analyses were generated using SIMCA (version 13.0.3.0; Umetrics, Umea, Sweden).  3.6.",3f77862e-b35d-42e3-baca-2dc0c03c4bd1
12,methods12," Verification of Database Hits with Standards All reference standards, besides N(5)-acetylornithine, 5,6-dihydrouridine, and N-acetyltaurine were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and measured on the same instrument using the same methods as for plasma and tumor tissue samples. N(5)-acetylornithine and 5,6-dihydrouridine were customly synthesized by MedChemTronica (Sollentuna, Sweden) and AKos GmbH (Lörrach, Germany) respectively, while N-acetytaurine was synthesized inhouse. Retention time and MS2 spectra concordance between samples and standards was assessed manually by visual comparison.  4. Conclusions The present study revealed molecular effects of KDs in a breast cancer mouse model. We could show that long chain triglycerides (LCT)-medium chain triglyceride (MCT)8 diet can shift a derailed plasma metabolome induced by breast cancer xenografts under chemotherapy back to the one of healthy mice.",cc2aba0b-88b3-4d0c-aab9-fa891c369171
13,methods13," Further, we found a strong up-regulation of amino acid metabolism as well as of amino acid N-acetylation in healthy and breast cancer bearing mice upon KD treatment. In this course, N(5)-acetylornithine, which is involved in amino acid biosynthesis as a precursor of arginine and proline was significantly down-regulated in plasma of the breast cancer xenograft group. long chain triglycerides (LCT)-medium chain triglyceride (MCT)8 diet, however, induced an elevation of N(5)-acetylornithine levels back to the ones found in healthy mice fed with a control diet. This raises the interest for this metabolite and therefore requires further investigation to disclose its relevance in relation to tumor growth and treatment with adjuvant KD.
