0,background0,"Angelman syndrome (AS) was first described in 1965 [1], and has a prevalence in the general population of 1:10,000–1:24,000 [2–4]. Loss or reduction of function of the maternal UBE3A gene (ubiquitin protein ligase E3A) was identified in the late 1990s as the causative mechanism in the majority of cases [5, 6]. Patients with AS universally have global developmental delays including speech impairment and movement disorders [7]. Individuals are typically described as having a happy disposition with frequent laughter. Eighty percent of patients also experience seizures, and all individuals with AS have a disordered electroencephalogram (EEG) [8, 9]. A large proportion of the population also has feeding problems (75%) and other gastrointestinal (GI) complaints [7, 10]. Unfortunately, AS has no cure. Typical treatment protocols include pharmacotherapy for seizures, physical and behavioral therapies, and educational interventions [11].",91d009b1-743c-4da0-94c4-5f2e53cbe795
1,background1," However, approximately 77% of the AS population experience treatment-resistant seizures [8].  Refractory epilepsy has been treated successfully with specialized dietary approaches, such as the ketogenic (KD), medium-chain-triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT))-based-, and low-glycemic-index diets (low glycemic index diets (LGIT)); these diets have also been successful in AS [12–15]. The KD allows the body to shift from carbohydrate-based metabolism to fat-based metabolism, thus stimulating hepatic ketogenesis. Nutritional ketosis is a state where the blood levels of ketone bodies are significantly above baseline, typically > 0.5 mmol/L. The ketone bodies (acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)) are energy substrates used by mitochondria to produce adenosine triphosphate, and can be used as alternative fuels to glucose by the brain, heart, and skeletal muscles.",abc36461-e414-4a4c-b4d8-b6dace970e03
2,background2,"  The high rate of refractory seizures, feeding and GI problems, and severe communication impairments in AS lead to a high unmet medical need. Overwhelming challenges exist to ensuring appropriate diets that serve the complex needs of individuals with AS. Nutritional approaches that promote the body’s use of ketones as an alternative fuel may improve overall nutritional status and allow for a liberalized dietary therapeutic strategy in individuals with AS and, therefore, improve quality of life.  Dietary supplementation with ketogenic ingredients is hypothesized to have an important impact on meeting the nutritional ketosis needs of patients with AS. Ketone supplements can aid in achieving and maintaining ketosis, improve the patient’s overall nutritional health in AS symptom management, and may improve quality of life for patients and their families.",b6de1e4e-b821-41dc-9197-c386becff713
3,background3," This study is designed as the first-ever to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the ketogenic ingredient beta-hydroxybutyrate in a patient population with a high rate of refractory epilepsy. This manuscript describes the rationale, methods, and potential importance of ketone-based nutritional interventions in children with AS.  Objectives The primary objective of the trial is to assess the tolerability of a nutritional formulation containing BHB in patients with AS aged 4–11 years on a variety of dietary backgrounds. The secondary objectives include assessment of ketosis when consuming the nutritional formulation and safety of the nutritional formulation in patients with AS. These outcome measures were chosen as this is a vulnerable, nonverbal population with limited ability to communicate difficulties with tolerability and safety concerns.",a396300c-91f0-4604-8c4c-10b2b36f2133

After obtaining informed consent from the parent/caregiver, subjects enter a 2-week run-in period. At the beginning of the run-in period the natural history and medical history is collected from the subject’s parent/caregiver. At baseline, a 3-day recall record of the subject’s diet, appetite, GI health, sleep, seizure, mood, and activity level are collected. While one goal of this study is to assess the effects of dietary background on the suitability of the nutritional formulation, there is no requirement for a specific number of patients per diet due to the rarity of the population. Additional study measures, including physiologic, are also collected (Fig. 1).

Subsequently, at the completion of the second intervention, they undergo the final scheduled study visit and laboratory sampling. A washout period follows Intervention Period 2, and at approximately week 16 of the study, a follow-up call is made to the family to review symptoms and ensure the patient is not experiencing adverse events during this period. The trial schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments is outlined in Fig. 1 (Formulation in patients with ANgelman Syndrome (FANS) trial schedule of procedures).",91901ecb-51a0-4ed9-8b6e-9aef2548f104
15,background15,"  Procedures and interventions Background information regarding the subject’s natural history is collected using a REDCap© survey (Copyright 2006–2013 Vanderbilt University.  [16]. Body weight and height are measured at each study visit. Serum laboratory analysis is conducted to establish a metabolic baseline: comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), and lipid panel. EEG, event related potential (ERP) and gait analysis using the ProtoKinetics Zeno™ Walkway are performed at each study visit (Fig. 1). The utility of event related potential (ERP) and gait analysis to predict changes in patient function in an Angelman population has not been clearly established, but their appropriateness in similar populations has been detailed elsewhere [17, 18].

Dietary intake, seizure frequency, sleep, and GI health are evaluated throughout the protocol through at-home monitoring. Data collected during home monitoring is recorded on tablet devices provided to the parents/caregivers upon enrollment, preloaded with necessary tracking applications. Families are provided an EarlySense® monitor with a written guidance for home sleep monitoring. External sleep monitors are important in an AS population as wearable devices are typically removed by the patient. The monitors have not been studied with patients with AS; however, their validity has been demonstrated in the general population [20].",6333acc1-fede-4a3b-8a70-603e51ea9390
17,background17," Urinary ketones are measured by the patient’s caregivers throughout the protocol, using Ketostix which are a validated measure of urine acetoacetate [21, 22].  Tolerability is determined at the end of each 4-week intervention period. Protocol compliance is monitored during both investigational and placebo intervention periods by recording the amount of formulation consumed. Formulation acceptability is assessed at the end of each intervention period by a parent questionnaire evaluating convenience, taste, and degree of acceptance of the nutritional formulation on a 10-point Likert scale or based on compliance with the study protocol and consumption of the formulation three times daily consistenty during the 4-week interventional period. Similar ranking systems to assess formulation acceptability have been used with other nutritional interventions in epilepsy populations [22–25].",e0d48210-91c7-4d56-a560-5841575cece1

20,background20,"  Statistical considerations The primary outcome of the trial is to assess the tolerability of a nutritional formulation containing BHB in patients with AS. Tolerability is demonstrated through patient compliance with the protocol as determined by the amount of formulation consumed as compared to the amount prescribed and is assessed at the end of each intervention period. Premature discontinuation of the nutritional formulation by the family is also deemed as potential intolerability. Tolerability is also assessed at the end of each intervention period through a parental questionnaire. These outcome measures were chosen as this is a vulnerable, nonverbal population with limited ability to communicate and, therefore, determining if the formulation is suitable and well tolerated is an appropriate first step.  The secondary outcomes include assessment of ketosis when consuming the nutritional formulation and safety of the nutritional formulation in patients with AS.",823e6e73-4d7f-4274-82e2-ff70ff2da669
21,background21," Ketosis is evaluated daily through urine testing as well as blood analysis at the end of each intervention period. The degree and timing of ketosis may be clinically relevant to demonstrating better patient nutrition as nutritional ketosis has been related to better patient outcomes as described in the background of this manuscript. Safety is evaluated by changes in motor function, cognitive function, GI tolerance, sleep, and seizures, along with changes in height, weight, and blood metabolic panels as assessed at the end of each intervention period. In addition, adverse event reporting is monitored in real time by the study coordinator.  No studies testing ketone supplementation in patients with AS exist. Therefore, sample-size estimation is based on measures of ketosis.",cab0de0a-65fe-4f04-a31e-3c467cf8abbd
22,background22," It is assumed from murine pre-clinical investigations, non-AS clinical studies using medium chain triglyceride (MCT) and/or BHB, and low-carbohydrate dietary interventions, that the minimal change of the secondary outcome, degree of ketosis, from the baseline to the end of the fourth week of the investigational formulation intervention period will be 100% change from baseline (baseline for standard diet is typically < 0.5mmol/L of d-BHB in blood, or < 5 mg/dL acetoacetate in urine). The acetoacetate test used is Ketostix (Bayer Corp. Diagnostics Division, Tarrytown, NY, USA) which exhibits a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 96% when compared to a serum standard of 14.4 ml/dL. Considering a 25% drop-out rate, an estimate of 25 subjects need to be screened to achieve 15 completers.

28,discussion0,"Angelman syndrome is characterized by refractory epilepsy. In fact, the EEGs of individuals with AS are abnormal when compared to neurotypical controls even in the absence of seizures [26]. Fasting has been recognized as a potential treatment for seizures since ancient times, and dietary intervention that mimicked fasting was introduced in the early 1920s [27, 28]. These diets place the body in a state of nutritional metabolic ketosis. Using nutritional ketosis as a model, many dietary interventions have been studied in both animal models and in human clinical trials for a variety of neurologic disorders.  For children with refractory epilepsy, dietary interventions leading to nutritional ketosis are efficacious and safe. A modified Atkin’s diet, prospectively studied in children aged 3–18 years, demonstrated that moderate urinary ketosis developed within 4 days with significant improvement in seizure frequency at 6 months [29]. In AS, case reports also demonstrate efficacy [30].",4750542d-3896-4189-94d9-07107906bb6b
29,discussion1," For a 5-year-old girl with uncontrollable daily seizures resistant to triple-anticonvulsant therapy, a KD proved to be effective in diminishing seizures from the first week of initiation. An EEG with no epileptic activity confirmed the patient’s improvement along with improvement in sleep and hyperactivity. In a separate study in patients with AS, 4 months of low glycemic index diets (LGIT) resulted in decreased seizure frequency with correlative improvement post-trial EEG, with evidence of developmental progress. The diet was well tolerated and five of six subjects remained on the low glycemic index diets (LGIT) after completion of the trial [14]. A retrospective medical record review of 23 subjects with AS who utilized low glycemic index diets (LGIT) suggested that 22% of subjects maintained complete seizure freedom, 43% maintained seizure freedom except in the setting of illness or non-convulsive status epilepticus, and 30% had a decrease in seizure frequency [13].",c620c24b-c5da-4ca1-a250-0377ac087cc6
30,discussion2,"  The literature suggests a safe transition from glucose to ketone bodies as fuel. A large study of the use of the low glycemic index diets (LGIT) diet in pediatric epilepsy revealed limited side effects and decreased seizure frequency [31]. Studies of the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet revealed GI complaints as the greatest tolerability issue [32]. Acidosis has also been reported. The risk of nutritional deficiency in children on restrictive dietary treatments and a lack of KD-specific supplements raised concerns about micronutrient status. Vitamins A and E, zinc, selenium, calcium, and magnesium levels have been measured in children with intractable epilepsy treated with the KD [33]. The researchers suggested that changes in plasma vitamins A and E and the decline in magnesium status after 12 months may be suboptimal and require supplemental approaches to the KD.",7bec6475-3bf1-4e2c-a942-c81b2310b8ed
31,discussion3,"  While clinical evidence suggests that nutritional ketosis through diet is effective, well tolerated and safe in seizure control; little clinical evidence is available regarding the consumption of exogenous ketones as part of nutritional support to improve a patient’s overall health, supporting dietary and pharmacologic management of seizures and other symptoms. Such an approach is supported by animal models. Transgenic mice, altered at the E6-AP ubiquitin ligase gene which is known to be the causative factor in AS, resemble human AS with motor dysfunction, inducible seizures, and a context-dependent learning deficits [5, 6, 34]. These mice were fed an exogenous ketone (R, S-1,3-butanediol acetoacetate diester) ad libitum for 8 weeks, mixed into the standard rodent chow at 10% weight/weight. The animals were in nutritional ketosis and demonstrated improved motor coordination, learning and memory, and synaptic plasticity [35].

These improvements returned to baseline levels on the first day without ketone supplementation [36].  The animal evidence supporting ketone supplementation and the clinical evidence for KDs in models of AS and seizure control, respectively, suggest that dietary interventions including exogenous ketones may be an important development in clinical management strategies. The current study is designed as an initial evaluation of ketogenic formulations used with a variety of dietary backgrounds. It represents a unique opportunity to study the potential benefits of nutritional intervention in a pediatric population (ages 4–11 years) with AS.",19f516ec-c30f-445b-85d6-08f7be6afd86
33,discussion5," The knowledge gained from the study may guide further evaluations in the use of exogenous ketones for nutritional strategies in the dietary management of patients AS.  It is known in the AS population that there is a large placebo effect. Our study also offers a unique design in which the use of objective measures is prioritized. We hope that this will yield measures that benefit future trials in the Angelman community in addition to a clearer understanding of the overall effectiveness and mechanism of action of BHB for inducing ketosis. The ultimate goal will be to positively impact nutritional status, which should enhance the ability of the patient to overcome the symptoms of AS such as seizures, cognition and learning, gait/mobility, and/or sleep disturbances.
