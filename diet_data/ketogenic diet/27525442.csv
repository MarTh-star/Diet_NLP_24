0,introduction0,"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women, with nearly 1.7 million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2012. It ranks as the fifth cause of death from cancer overall (522,000 deaths) and is the leading cause of cancer death in women [1]. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with several biologically distinct subtypes. Triple-negative breast cancer (triple negative breast cancerTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC)) is defined by the absence of immunohistochemical expression of the estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR) receptors and a lack of amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/Neu gene, accounting for approximately 20% of breast cancer cases. triple negative breast cancerTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a highly aggressive nature, develops among younger women, and has a higher risk of distant metastasis than other types of breast cancers.",1b99074f-c9d5-4a66-9366-310be0f50360
1,introduction1," Its lack of molecular targets has contributed in part to the difficulty in managing triple negative breast cancerTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only systemic therapy available for these patients. In the treatment of early-stage disease, chemotherapy is effective and pathologic complete response (pCR) rates exceed those of hormonal receptor-positive subtypes [2]. However, patients with metastatic disease experience rapid progression through several lines of chemotherapy. No prior studies have evaluated the influence of metabolically supported chemotherapy (metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT)), ketogenic diet (KD), hyperthermia (HT), and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)) as a therapeutic strategy for managing triple negative breast cancerTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC).",e27d7801-d1a5-416d-80c3-d06eadf544f4
2,introduction2,"  The rationale for metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT) is based on Warburg’s hypothesis that “cancer is a disease of metabolic dysregulation” where aerobic fermentation compensates for insufficient oxidative phosphorylation for energy generation [3]. In practice, metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT) initiates with a 12-hour fast, the application of pharmacological doses of regular insulin, and the development of mild hypoglycemia prior to the administration of chemotherapy. As was previously demonstrated in a case report of rectal cancer and a case series in pancreatic cancer, metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT) may enhance the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy [4-5].  The reduction in circulating glucose can exploit the dependency of cancer cells reliant on glycolytic fermentation. The KD, a high-fat, carbohydrate-restricted diet, decreases blood glucose levels and elevates blood ketone levels, thus slowing the progression of cancer [6].",e011d4d3-1282-4d03-9337-5b9dcd4419e9
3,introduction3," HT exposes body temperature to 42°C or higher and exploits the heat sensitivity of cancer cells [7]. Tumor hypoxia increases the glycolytic dependency of cancer cells, and hypoxic environments have cancer-promoting effects. hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) increases oxidative stress specifically in tumor cells and reverses the cancer-promoting effects of hypoxia [8]. We report here a case of stage IV triple negative breast cancerTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in a patient that achieved a complete clinical, radiological, and pathological response after receiving a combination of metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT), KD, HT, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).  Case presentation An overweight 29-year-old woman with a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) of 28.1 presented with a lump in her left breast that was detected during a physical examination in December 2015.

7,introduction7,"  An metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT) protocol designed for the patient consisted of docetaxel (30 mg/m2), doxorubicin (20 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m2). This drug combination was administered following a 12-hour fast and the introduction of 5 to 10 units of regular insulin (Humulin R). Chemotherapy delivery was initiated at blood glucose levels of 50 to 60 mg/dL. With the patient’s written and informed consent, this therapy was delivered on the first and eighth day of a 21-day cycle for a total of four months. Insulin delivery and chemotherapy infusions were delivered after assessing blood glucose levels upon arrival at the clinic, and the insulin dosage was sufficient to lower her blood glucose to approximately 50 mg/dL prior to delivery of the chemotherapy drugs.  In addition to metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT), the patient was encouraged to consume a KD.

Her urinary ketone levels were also checked prior to each metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT) session and served as a measure of her dietary compliance. The patient remained compliant with the KD presumably because of her understanding of the poor prognosis of this disease and her oncology team’s knowledge about the previously published papers reporting the efficacy and importance of the KD [6,9].",de1a6cb6-cb6a-4539-9747-c57315084ecc

The OncoTherm EHY-3010 HT device (OncoTherm, Troisdorf, Germany) was used to gradually increase her body temperature to 45°C for each hyperthermia session (12 sessions, 60 minutes each) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. A mobile electrode measuring 40 cm x 50 cm was positioned on the thorax and abdomen that fully involved both the primary lesion and the liver metastasis. The Quamvis 320 hyperbaric oxygen chamber (OxyHealth, California, US) was used to produce an operating pressure of 1.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA; 12 sessions, 60 minutes each).

There are, currently, no specific treatment guidelines for managing triple negative breast cancerTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and the lack of identifiable molecular targets makes management even more challenging. However, pCR is strongly correlated with a favorable long-term prognosis [10]. We proposed that the effect of standard chemotherapy drugs would be enhanced when combined with therapies that also target the metabolic weaknesses of cancer cells with the goal of achieving pCR.",89ba84a3-abcd-4a19-b4b8-a943fc79e7cd
17,discussion1," metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT) is a therapeutic strategy that builds on Warburg’s theory that tumor cells lack metabolic flexibility and become dependent on the aerobic fermentation of glucose due to impaired respiration [3-5, 9]. In the case presented here, this therapeutic strategy included the induction of mild hypoglycemia achieved through a 12-hour fast and pharmacological doses of insulin prior to each administration of chemotherapy.  The strong dependence of cancer cells on glucose makes them vulnerable to KDs that lower blood glucose levels while elevating levels of circulating ketone bodies. Ketone bodies are water-soluble energy substrates derived from fatty acid metabolism. They cannot be utilized for energy in cancer cell mitochondria due to respiratory defects [9].",5f7c1b33-6cff-4333-a5ae-86e7bc70acb1
18,discussion2," Although the KD has been used for decades as a treatment for intractable pediatric epilepsy, its potential as a therapy for targeting energy metabolism in cancer cells has only recently been explored [6]. The reduced blood glucose levels with elevated urinary ketone levels observed in this patient are theorized to have contributed in part to the patient’s pCR.  In addition to the KD, HT and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) also targeted the defective energy metabolism of tumor cells. HT contributes to a therapeutic effect by aiding the uptake of drugs, increasing oxygen radical production, and inhibiting DNA repair in cancer cells, which leads to cancer cell death [7]. hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) targets tumor hypoxia, which is associated with tumor aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy [8].",1355f1f9-1ad0-49ba-a791-790563295954
19,discussion3," Both HT and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) also exploit the reliance of tumor cells on glycolysis, a major contributor to the upregulation of antioxidant activity responsible for the tumor’s increased resistance to pro-oxidant chemotherapy and radiation therapies [9]. Consequently, HT and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) will selectively increase oxidative stress in the tumor cells. Ketone bodies protect normal cells from this stress while also providing a substrate for energy production. We suggest that the synergistic effect of targeting cancer cell metabolism concurrent with the standard chemotherapy drugs contributed to the patient’s pCR. Moreover, it is important to emphasize that the patient tolerated this treatment well and reported no discomfort or adverse event.",373eca03-541e-4a75-be02-3ceb7c258940
20,discussion4," This underscores the need to determine if our patient’s response to this treatment was an isolated occurrence or if this response might also be seen in a larger cohort of patients with triple negative breast cancerTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC).  Despite the advanced stage of this disease, the therapeutic strategy of combining metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT), KD, HT, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) achieved a clinical and radiological complete response in this patient within four months. The treatment regimen was continued for an additional two months when pCR was further documented in tissue following her mastectomy.  Conclusions triple negative breast cancerTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is more aggressive and metastatic than other types of breast cancer and has a lack of molecular targets making it more difficult to manage than other cancers.",1e543ae7-df71-413f-9edb-af97f07a84b8

This single case study presents evidence of a complete clinical, radiological, and pathological response following a six-month treatment period using a combination of metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT) and a novel metabolic therapy in a patient with stage IV triple negative breast cancerTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Given this patient’s remarkable favorable outcomes, further research and randomized clinical trials exploring add-on therapies (such as KD, HT, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)) that may enhance the efficacy of traditional cancer treatments by exploiting the metabolic weaknesses in cancer cells are warranted, especially for patients with poor prognosis of high grade and/or late-stage cancer that is not expected to respond to treatment.",16bfa852-d7d1-4eda-b954-fccd3eb76467
22,discussion6," Furthermore, this patient did not experience the adverse effects that are commonly associated with the current standard of care and this improved quality of life should also be considered when designing research that compares outcomes of metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT), KD, HT, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to traditional treatment.
