0,introduction0,"Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES)) is a rare epileptic encephalopathy of unknown etiology which occurs in patients without active epilepsy or underlying neurological disorders. It is characterized by new onset of refractory status epilepticus (SE) following a short nonspecific febrile illness (1). It is a biphasic disease, with an acute phase of refractory SE that always transforms into super-refractory SE (super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), i.e., SE that continues or recurs 24 h or more after the onset of anesthesia). This condition often requires intensive care and management, and it often progresses to a chronic phase which is characterized by refractory epilepsy without an intervening silent period. In the acute phase, the risk of mortality is high. Moreover, survivors are likely to live with a drug-resistant epilepsy and neuropsychological impairment.",c790d203-f486-4a35-abaf-06d4dd403773
1,introduction1," Nevertheless, few individuals do not experience neurologic sequelae or mild learning difficulties (2). Multiple therapeutic modalities have been reported for this disease, but most of them do not effectively control the high epileptic activity in such patients (3). Therefore, it is imperative to develop Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) therapies with high efficacy.  Ketogenic diet (KD) contains high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and moderate protein content. It alters the primary cerebral energy supply from glucose to ketone bodies, mimicking the biochemical changes of starvation (4, 5). Although the exact mechanisms of KD's are not well-defined, it is thought that KD has antiepileptic activity, anti-inflammatory effect and neuroprotective activity (6–9) making it a therapeutic target for Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES).",47931e2b-db65-4300-9b0b-d13bf5ac161a
2,introduction2," In recent years, several small case studies have highlighted the value of diet in the treatment of Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES). Results from such studies indicate that diet is not only suitable for acute patient management, but also for long-term management (10, 11). In April 2018, the International Ketogenic Diet Study Group have reached a consensus that KD is particularly useful for Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) (12).  Despite fatal presentation, high disability and fatality rate in patients with Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), this syndrome is rarely diagnosed. Patient with Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) are often diagnosed using the exclusion diagnosis method, and this explains why patients with Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) are often diagnosed at a late stage due to lack of early disease markers.",aeac1150-5463-4e41-8c5d-16cb3668de22
3,introduction3," Currently, there is inadequate scientific data on the therapeutic efficacy of early initiation of KD for Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES). Therefore, we aimed to explore strategies for timely recognition of Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) through EEG recordings. Moreover, the KD therapy was given to 7 patients with Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) and super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) to investigate the efficacy and safety of KD as well as determine the effect of early KD treatment on the prognosis of Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) patients.

4,methods0," We performed a retrospective review of patients who met the diagnostic criteria of Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), and were treated with KD between 2015 and 2018 at the Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. The following data were recorded: demographic features, clinical presentation, anticonvulsant treatment, timing and duration of KD and follow-up information. Electroencephalography recordings were reviewed and analyzed.  Patients and Approvals We carried out a retrospective review of 7 patients diagnosed with Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) (13, 14) and super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), and treated with KD at the Department of Pediatrics of Xiangya Hospital in Central South of China between 2015 and 2018. This study was approved by The Central South University Institutional Review Board.",0cc9b1b8-d385-4ce4-99bc-43e8d4784eb1
5,methods1,"  Clinical Data The following patient data was collected: demographics, general situations, history of seizures or SE, Glasgow Coma Scale (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)), total hospital length of stay (length of stay (LOS)), ICU length of stay (LOS), and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used before KD initiation and at discharge. Anesthetic agents, SE duration prior to KD, KD ratio, type and duration of KD, presence of ketones, and KD side effects were also obtained. KD therapy, seizure burden and modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) score at follow-up were collected in the outpatient neurology clinics. The clinical data were supplemented by a retrospective review of the electronic medical records (electronic medical records (EMC)).  Considering that SE has a subtle or no clinical manifestations in Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), its diagnosis requires EEG monitoring. Here, two approaches were adopted to define SE.",ecab6a10-d732-4271-a7ec-105990db3843
6,methods2," Before hospital admission, SE was defined by continuous clinical or electrographic seizures lasting 5 min or more and/or recurrent episodes without recovery in between episodes (15). After admission, SE was defined by either a single seizure lasting ≥30 min or recurrent seizures totaling ≥30 min in any 1-h period (16).  All EEG recordings were digital with time-locked synchronized video. Electrodes were positioned in accordance with the international 10–20 system of electrode placement. The EMG activity and ECG were also recorded. All patients were monitored with EEG for 2–15 h immediately after arrival at our PICU. The frequency of EEG monitoring varies, depending on available institutional resources and perceived clinical condition. All EEG recordings were analyzed individually by a board-certified pediatric neurologist and two Asian Epilepsy Academy (Asian Epilepsy Academy (ASEPA))-certified electroencephalographers.",af58b1bf-127f-4fbc-bb61-813455698dde
7,methods3," The following EEG features were analyzed: seizure burden, interictal and periodic epileptiform discharges, background activity, and sleep architecture. Five segments of EEG recordings were reviewed selectively to confirm the specific EEG pattern of Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) and the effectiveness of KD. We used the first recording at admission to our PICU as the 1# epoch, the last recording prior to initiation of KD as the 2# epoch. The recording at which SE disappeared after KD treatment was recorded as the 4# epoch, and the last recording before discharge as the 5# epoch. The 3# epoch was selected to divide the period between 2 and 4# approximately into two equal parts. All EEG data was stored in original format and was used for review.  Data were analyzed by reviewing of physician notes, laboratory findings, neuroimaging studies, EEG recordings and other supporting data.",0484c5e8-4bba-4b91-8b0e-0133decc608a
8,methods4,"  Diet Initiation Baseline laboratory examinations including complete blood counts, serum carnitine, chemistries, electrolytes, lipids, fatty acids were performed for all patients prior to KD initiation. These parameters were evaluated by a collaborative team of neurologists, critical care medicine personnel and nutrition experts to ensure there were no contraindications to KD therapy. KD was administered through two routes without a fasting period. All patients received enteral KD (EN KD) except 2 patients with severe gastrointestinal dysfunction who were placed on intravenous KD (IV KD). The commercially available ketogenic formula (Jiantong, Kinton medical food. Ltd, Guangzhou, China) with a fat to protein and carbohydrate (in gram scale) ratio of 4:1 were administered via enteral route and mixed with the current formula at the prescribed ketogenic ratio.",724b7af6-3a0d-4001-b9df-1cd6bef34c5a
9,methods5," IV KD comprised of commercially available fat emulsion with medium-chain triglycerides (Lipovenoes MCT, Sino-Swed Pharmaceutical Corp. Ltd, Wuxi, China), dextrose and amino acid solutions (Vamin, Sino-Swed Pharmaceutical Corp. Ltd, Wuxi, China).  The KD was initiated at a low ratio (about 2–3:1 in EN KD, 1:1 in IV KD) and then gradually advanced to a ratio of 3–4:1. The calorie intake of KD was restricted to 1/3 of the estimated diet energy needs (75% of recommended dietary allowance) initially and increased by 1/3 every 1–3 days (slower in IV KD) to full estimated diet energy. This step-by-step approach was adopted to prevent hypertriglyceridemia or hyperamylasemia induced by high intake or infusion of lipids. All dextrose was removed from fluids and all medications were changed to low-carbohydrate forms. Glucose-free solutions such as anticonvulsants and saline were prepared as required. Electrolytes, minerals, vitamins, and micronutrients were prepared at normal concentrations.",dfac53f4-1384-4bbf-b32b-13188226345f
10,methods6," The enteral preparation was given 6–8 times per day. IV KD was infused continuously over 20 h and stopped for 4 h. When enteric-related complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding and enteroparalysis were resolved, EN KD was initiated and the calorie intake was increased by 1/10–1/5 of the estimated daily intake, adjusted after each 1–2 days to replace IV KD. Electrolytes, arterial blood gases, serum ketone bodies and glucose were measured once KD was initiated.  Data Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (IBM, SPSS Statistics Version 21). Proportions were calculated for continuous variables whereas medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were calculated for categorical variables. Pearson correlation analysis was applied for the duration of SE before KD initiation and mRS score at the latest follow-up (the normality test was completed). ",a015a96e-11dc-4725-8df0-e11264ccc6de
11,results0," Seven patients with Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) were put on KD (5 via enteral route, and 2 via intravenous line) for super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) in the PICU. The median age was 8. Four patients were male and 3 were female. Although patients underwent treatment with a median of 4 antiepileptic drugs and 2 anesthetic agents, the status epilepticus (SE) persisted for 7–31 days before KD initiation. After KD initiation, all patients achieved ketosis and SE disappeared within an average of 5 days (IQR 3.5), although there were minor side effects. In 6 patients, a unique pattern was identified in the EEG recording at the peak period. After initiation of KD, the number of seizures reduced, the duration of seizure shortened, the background recovered and sleep architecture normalized in the EEG recordings. The early initiation of KD (at the onset of SE) in the acute phase of patients decreased the mRS score in the subsequent period (p = 0.012, r = 0.866).",d1610771-68a4-40fe-897b-96f465fa170e
12,results1,"  Conclusions: The characteristic EEG pattern in the acute phase promoted timely diagnosis of Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES). Our data suggest that KD may be a safe and promising therapy for Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) with super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), and that early initiation of KD produces a favorable prognosis. Therefore, KD should be applied earlier in the course of Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES). Intravenous KD can be an effective alternative route of administration for patients who may not take KD enterally.  ketogenic dietfebrile infection-related epilepsy syndromesuper-refractory status epilepticusPICUEEGNational Natural Science Foundation of China10.",13f59452-2d07-44b8-ba85-8f9af7835037

Fever preceded the first seizures with a median duration of 4 days, ranging from 2 to 5 days. Shortly after onset of seizures, within 24 h, the seizures rapidly progressed into SE or became frequent with loss of consciousness between the attacks.

At the peak hours of SE, we identified a characteristic EEG pattern consisting of focal ictal activity of small to moderate amplitude at the onset of the seizure, which evolved into higher amplitude and faster/slower frequency, spreading unilaterally and/or bilaterally, sometimes shifting from one hemisphere to the contralateral. These features can be used for early recognition and intervention of Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES).  Currently, there are no effective treatments for Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES).

Interestingly, some children with Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) displayed good response to KD. Nine studies including 26 patients have reported this phenomenon (7, 10, 13, 17–22). The effective rate (>50% seizure reduction) was 62%. In this study of 7 children with Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) and super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), we found that immunotherapy and AEDs could not control this condition, but KD treatment produced significant therapeutic efficacy and safety, which is consistent with previous reports.  It is worth noting that the clinical presentation of patients in this study shows that early initiation of KD improves outcomes of Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES).",7692e70e-dfb0-4b03-9c43-3781b29d41b5
32,discussion3," In all patients, the frequency of seizures at the last follow-up was similar, and seizures were reduced by ≥75% in all patients except one who converted to vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). However, their functional outcomes were dissimilar. A shorter duration of SE in the acute phase of patients indicated a lower mRS score in the subsequent period (p = 0.012, r = 0.866). Patients (2, 3, 5, 7) who had an SE duration of < 15 days before initiation of KD had a better prognosis with mRS scores ≤ 3 at the end of KD and ≤ 1 at the last follow up. In these patients, it is important to recognize Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) symptoms early using specific EEG pattern and initiate KD treatment. KD therapy resolved super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) successfully unlike other treatments (immunotherapy, four or more AEDs, and at least one general anesthetic agent).",ab627ce6-ac95-4d45-85c1-04f9382d9940
33,discussion4," This indicates that KD can prevent damage from excitotoxicity processes, inhibit secondary processes induced by initial excitotoxicity, prevent multiple complications due to prolonged anesthesia and unconsciousness, increase alertness of patients and decrease the need for invasive respiratory support.  Generally, KD can be administered through enteral route (by mouth or tubes). But patients with conditions such as Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) often suffer from gastrointestinal problems caused by prolonged use of AEDs, general anesthetics and mechanical ventilation. Some of the gastrointestinal problems include vomiting, severe diarrhea, and intestinal bleeding. Therefore, administration of drugs using enteral route may worsen these complications. In fact, in the presence of these conditions, enteral intake of KD is compromised and ketosis is impaired, making KD diet unsafe and inefficient (23).",c4563d69-28d2-4a45-b8b0-1c57ec1d4ba6
34,discussion5," In this study, KD was given as parenteral nutrition to 2 children with Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) and super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) (patient 1 and 5) who required bowel rest due to upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage or gastroplegia. Thereafter, they were converted to enteral diet successfully. This study has demonstrated that KD can be effectively applied to patients with intestinal failure who need to start KD early.  The major limitations of this study should be discussed. This is a retrospective study containing a small number of patients. Considering the severity of patients with super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), we were unable to include a group of patients with super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) and Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) who were not put on KD treatment during the same period for comparison.",f5078ffc-4b53-4c63-a616-17591213ef8d
35,discussion6," Moreover, a combination of treatments comprising AEDs, immunotherapy and KD was used, making it difficult to isolate the exact benefit of a single intervention while excluding other treatments. Nevertheless, considering the rapid response (resolution of SE in clinical course and improvement of EEG features on assistant examination) in acute phase and good prognosis of patients in this study, we conclude that KD treatment is effective for Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) patients. More studies are needed to reveal the exact mechanism of KD in Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), define the optimal timing and propose a protocol of KD application.  Conclusions In summary, this study shows that KD has a therapeutic effect on Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), especially in the acute phase as it can resolve super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE).",e46a830c-d025-4baa-8734-fdf22b368779
36,discussion7," Early identification of Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) and prompt initiation of KD therapy may improve the prognosis of this condition. Unique EEG features of Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) may aid early diagnosis. Intravenous KD is a reasonable alternative for patients who cannot take KD enterally due to intestinal failure.  Author Contributions PP, LM, and JP conceived the study. XD and FH provided the clinical information and PP checked. CC, XW, and JP analyzed the EEG data. PP drafted the initial manuscript which was edited by LM, SG, FY, and JP.
