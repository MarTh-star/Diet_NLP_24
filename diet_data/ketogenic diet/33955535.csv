0,introduction0," Epilepsy is a neurological disease that affects both children and adults. Although an increasing number of etiologies (e.g. structural, metabolic, or infectious) have been identified, the cause of epilepsy still remains unclear in many patients.1 Furthermore, as almost a third of epilepsy patients do not achieve adequate seizure control in spite of drug treatment, current strategies are clearly insufficient.2 Importantly, most available therapies are directed at symptomatic epilepsy management rather than targeting the pathogenic mechanisms of disease and the term “anti-epileptic drugs” has therefore been suggested to be altered to “anti-seizure medications”.3 Identifying pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development (i.e. the epileptogenesis) and the sustained activity of epilepsy may offer new targets for pharmacological interventions in treating patients with intractable epilepsy and even target the development of disease per se.",0c49ddf8-13a8-47f6-8ce0-ded5aa03a641
1,introduction1," A role of inflammatory processes in both the epileptogenesis and sustainment of epilepsy has been demonstrated in both human and experimentally acquired epilepsies (reviewed in3), and recently also in genetic epilepsies.4 The relationship between inflammation and epilepsy is thus reciprocal with inflammation contributing to seizure precipitation and seizures inducing inflammation.  For children with refractory, i.e., pharmaco-resistant epilepsy, ketogenic dietary therapies, including classic ketogenic diet (KD), (Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) and Medium Chain Triglycerides (Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT)) are well-established, non-pharmacological treatment alternatives that have been used for many years.5 KD is a high-fat, sufficient-protein and very low-carbohydrate dietary therapy. Randomized controlled studies have shown >50% seizure reduction of KD in up to one half of children with refractory epilepsy.",5cdbabc5-87bc-47b0-8699-6628360c3df3
2,introduction2,"6,7  During KD, as intake of carbohydrates is limited and intake of fats is drastically increased, the body induces ketosis with production of ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone) which are used as an alternative energy substrate for ATP production in cells. This metabolic shift induces many biochemical, metabolic and hormonal changes that may contribute to decreased neuronal excitability and seizure reduction. However, the underlying mechanisms of action of KD are still not clear. Neither is it clear, why some patients respond to the treatment with less seizures while other do not. Several potential hypotheses have been proposed. These include enhanced GABA-mediated inhibition, inhibitory actions of polyunsaturated fatty acids on ion channels, elevated ATP levels which convert to the inhibitory mediator adenosine, as well as increased mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced oxidative stress.8 Recently, other possible mechanisms of action have been proposed.",f57c090c-788a-49ef-a249-a4b9fc9bfdcd
3,introduction3," These include anti-inflammatory actions, epigenetic changes, and changes in the gut microbial composition.9  The aim of this study was to analyse changes in the fecal microbiota and levels of blood inflammation markers after three months on KD treatment in a cohort of children with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Using state-of-the-art bioinformatics and machine learning methods we identified specific signatures of correlated microbial and inflammatory signals related to the anti-seizure effect of the diet.

4,background0," Recently, studies have suggested a role for the gut microbiota in epilepsy. Gut microbial changes during ketogenic diet (KD) treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy have been described. Inflammation is associated with certain types of epilepsy and specific inflammation markers decrease during KD. The gut microbiota plays an important role in the regulation of the immune system and inflammation. ",17c448d7-15fd-42b3-8ca8-33cc609f5022

After a clinical decision was made to start the KD for treatment of refractory epilepsy, patients were asked to participate in the present study and were enrolled consecutively. The inclusion criteria were age older than 1.5 years and younger than 18; pharmaco-resistant epilepsy not accessible to epilepsy surgery, no medical contraindications to treatment with KD, no antibiotics or probiotics treatment within three months before sampling, and informed consent for participation in the study by a legal guardian.

Serum samples from both time points were available from 14 children. Three children only provided a serum sample at one time point. These were included in the unpaired analyses as described below. Demographics on the patient cohort and patients included in the sub studies are shown in Table 1. The age at KD initiation and first feces and blood sampling in the study group was 7.7 ± 4.6 (mean ± SD) years; range 1.9–17.8 years. The gender distribution was 11 boys and 17 girls.

The most common seizure types were tonic and generalized tonic-clonic. The etiology and epilepsy syndrome were classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification from 2017.1 The etiology was structural in ten children, genetic in twelve and in the remaining six it was unknown. Among the patients with structural lesions a genetic basis was found in three of these patients.

However, the majority of these children managed to take half or more of their food orally.  Study design  In line with our previously published pilot study11 the design was as follows:  The efficacy of the KD was evaluated based on seizure response. Seizure frequency was calculated from seizure calendars routinely used in our clinic. Here, parents and other caregivers daily recorded the number and type(s) of seizures. The mean seizure frequency the month before initiation of the KD was calculated as baseline and was compared to the mean frequency during the month preceding follow-up visit at three months on diet. Children with ≥50% seizure reduction were classified as responders and those with < 50% reduction as non-responders.",a7a9a4e6-e6a1-48b8-8c7f-78b2b41fcd81
10,methods7,"  In this study we used the classical KD and followed a standardized protocol, which is a slightly modified version of the protocol of the Johns Hopkins Hospital.12 A dietitian, specially trained to carry out KD treatment, calculated the total calorie level per day and composition of meals and supplements for each child. The calculations of the total calorie amount and the energy percentage derived from fats, proteins and carbohydrates was based on a 2-day diary kept by the parents before admission in which they recorded all food consumed by the child. The caloric level was then modified to the recommended calorie amount according to age, weight as well as to the expected level of physical activity. Fasting or restriction of calories or fluids were not utilized. A minimum of 1g/kg body weight per day of protein was included.

For the initiation of KD, the child was hospitalized for about four days for surveillance and educational purposes of caregivers. Before the diet start, a blood sample was obtained in the morning before breakfast for analyses of glucose, the ketone β-hydroxybutyric acid (β-OHB) and inflammatory markers. During the hospital stay KD meals were introduced. The diet was monitored by clinical examinations and daily blood levels of β-OHB, glucose, and acid-base balance to avoid hypoglycemia and acidosis. KD was usually started on a ratio of 2:1. This ratio was increased once a week by 0.5. Blood was sampled to monitor ketones, glucose and acid-base balance after increases in ratio. An optimal ratio for the individual was normally reached within 3–6 weeks. This ratio was kept constant until three months after start when KD was evaluated concerning efficacy and the second fecal and blood samples were taken.",2802f644-d425-44e0-b83e-52743f6daa9f
12,methods9,"  All children were taking ASMs during KD. The rationale was trying to avoid ASM dose changes before evaluation of KD at three months to minimize confounding factors which was achieved in the majority of cases (see Methods, Patients cohort description).  Fecal sample collection, transport and storage  Fecal samples were obtained by swab from the diaper or toilet paper by a parent using a sterile FLOQSwab™ (Copan). The first sample was taken at home the day before starting KD or in the morning of the day of starting. The second sampling at three months on diet was collected at home and the swabs were kept in a refrigerator for a few hours until transported to the hospital on ice and immediately stored at −70 °C.

Members of the B. longum cluster correlated positively with TNF, whereas members of the diverse Bifido cluster significantly negatively correlated with CCL25 (Figure 3). Thus, these Bifidobacteria may exhibit different functions. Bifidobacteria, especially B. breve and B. longum, are typically associated with breastfeeding and an immature gut microbiota. They are more abundant during early life and decrease with age.35 No participant was breastfed during our study and the youngest was 1.9 years old. However, the decline of Bifidobacteria may occur during the first years of life. Our cohort had an age range of 1.9 to 17.8 years, the mean age of non-responders was 7.3 years before starting KD and for responders it was 8.0. We analysed whether the Bifidobacteria in our samples negatively correlated with age.",c39a6e82-0794-4ae3-9afb-18df80ebf9a6
43,results17," We observed negative correlations of B. longum cluster members with age (either significantly or as a trend) in the non-responders both before starting KD and during KD (Figure 4B). In responders, however, this correlation was absent prior to KD treatment. After three months on KD, responders converted to moderate negative correlation of B. longum cluster members with age. At young age (below four years), responders and non-responders had comparable relative abundances of members of the B. longum cluster; however, the older the patients were, the more apparent the differences became. Responders exhibited higher relative B. longum/breve abundance compared to non-responders with the most pronounced differences above 15 years of age.

Albeit using a different approach for taxonomic profiling and analyses, including machine learning, these taxa were identified among others as important drivers of microbial changes during KD. Our new approach enabled higher resolution at species and strain level. Changes in relative abundance of several E. coli strains and various Bifidobacterial species were associated with the dietary intervention.  Recently, several studies investigating the gut microbial changes during KD in epilepsy patients have been published and several reviews have summarized these findings.36,37 Unfortunately, most studies were small in cohort size as KD is an expanding but still not common treatment option in epilepsy.",90b92688-4c1f-446d-9e26-acd75ea10f49
47,discussion1," These studies employed different designs with varying compositions of the diet and treatment lengths. Sample processing and analysis differed as well as demographics. Thus, the lack of consensual findings is not surprising. However, our findings are in agreement with several other studies. We find Bacteroides as important taxa associated with KD as previously demonstrated.38,39 In three independent cohorts comparing the gut microbiota of drug-resistant epilepsy patients and healthy controls, Bactereoides were decreased in epilepsy.38,40,41 Importantly, the decrease in Bifidobacteria during KD previously identified in our pilot study11 and by Xie et al.38 was recently confirmed by Gong et al.42 Unfortunately, the gut microbiota was analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V4 region) which does not provide species-level identification of Bifidobacteria.",729fd5aa-9b28-4412-96b0-994b4b052be3

During KD treatment of overweight or obese adults both a decrease in Bifidobacteria and an increase in E. coli was observed.44 Here, Bifidobacteria abundance was negatively associated with BHB levels and Th17 cells. Functional analysis by Lindefeldt et al.11 revealed a significant decrease in several microbial pathways of carbohydrate metabolism during KD associated with the decrease in Bifidobacterial abundances. As KD is usually deprived of fiber and Bifidobacteria thrive on dietary fiber,45 this finding is not surprising.",ce4f9760-40fa-4d0d-8004-d955ec150ec4
49,discussion3,"  Our machine learning approach demonstrated that there was a discriminating microbial signature in fecal samples comparing patients before starting KD to after three months on KD. To some extent, we could also distinguish responders from non-responders at baseline based on their fecal microbes. However, the poor performance of the algorithms to delineate responders from non-responders after three months of KD indicates little differences in the gut microbial profiles during KD. Similar findings in the inflammation profiles suggest that responders have a different gut microbial and inflammation profile before treatment, which may contribute to seizure propensity.  Inflammation has been shown to play a role in both the origin of individual seizures as well as the epileptogenic process between seizures in both patients and in animal models.46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 According to Meng et al., inflammation may be both the trigger and result of epilepsy.",a68895f3-8c44-449a-80fc-9a9456540e87
50,discussion4," Thus, treatment strategies mitigating inflammation are worth exploring.53 Systemic inflammation can potentially disrupt the blood-brain barrier (blood brain barrier (BBB)) enabling infiltration of peripheral toxic molecules and cytokine-producing immune cells and thus contribute to epileptogenesis.54 Protection of blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity may diminish seizure occurrence.55  The ketogenic diet has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties.56, 57, 58 Previous studies on the effect of KD on systemic inflammation demonstrated changes in cytokines levels, e.g., decrease in TNF, IL-1ß and IL-17A.56,59 We observed an overall decrease in inflammation-related peptides during treatment, with few exceptions (Figure 2A). We were able to confirm the previously described decrease in TNF and IL-17A.  Only three of the 92 inflammation-associated peptides increased significantly during KD, namely IL-18, CCL25 and IL-1alpha.",962206dc-5e4c-4085-912d-bd8d1b0c14b4
51,discussion5," IL-18 has been proposed to help maintain a healthy gut microbiota and to protect from colitis likely involving induction of mucin production.60, 61, 62, 63 However, while IL-18 increases in serum during KD, systemic IL-18R1 (also known as IL-18Rα or IL-1R-related protein (IL-1Rrp)), its essential receptor,64 decreases significantly. IL-18-binding protein was not analysed. Thus, the role of IL-18 during KD may be confined to the gut but remains currently unclear. Under local inflammatory conditions, expression of CCL25 in the colon can be induced as observed in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) where it correlated with disease severity.65 UC is commonly associated with increased abundance of various pathogenic E. coli strains in the gut66, 67, 68, 69 and a role for E. coli in CCL25 induction has been suggested.70 The increase of CCL25 in our cohort correlated with an increase in several E. coli strains during KD.

52,discussion6," coli-associated increase in colonic inflammation during KD but further studies are needed to evaluate the consequences of the potential risk for intestinal inflammation during KD treatment as previously discussed by Lindefeldt et al.11 We need to keep in mind that the methodologies used in this study only render relative abundance of fecal microbes. Thus, a relative increase in E. coli during KD might reflect a mere decrease of most gut microbes upon fiber-deprivation and not an actual increase in E. coli.  We found that responders to KD had significantly higher serum levels of both TNF and IL-12B than non-responders before starting treatment and these levels decreased significantly during three months of dietary intervention. In the brain, TNF71 can increase the number of glutamate receptors and decrease the number of GABA receptors via endocytosis.72 This leads to increased excitatory and decreased inhibitory synaptic strength.",bd0f0553-34c5-4bf0-806f-4eafe5b3b3a8
53,discussion7," Increase of TNF due to neuronal insults might thus result in neuronal dysfunction and overexcitation potentially causing or exacerbating seizures. High levels of systemic TNF have been associated with epilepsy, particularly with drug-resistant epilepsy.73 It also plays a major role in the inflammatory response to infection and cancer. It promotes inflammation and is involved in various autoimmune disorders. IL-12B, also known as IL-12p40, is a common subunit of both IL-12 and IL-23. Interestingly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy blood donors74 or cord blood from neonates produced both high levels of IL-12 and TNF when stimulated by typical gut commensal gram-positive bacteria, including Bifidobacteria.75,76 Several species and subspecies of Bifidobacteria have been shown to induce TNF production in various in vitro models77, 78, 79 of which B. adolescentis induced the lowest levels of TNF.79 In addition, B.",e0b0085c-a88e-49c9-b069-e9ee0adbeb6a

Both CCL3 and CCL4 might be involved in the responders-specific signalling between microbiota and inflammation but might not serve as good biomarkers as their expression was not found significantly different between responders and non-responders in our small cohort. Taken together, the results suggest that the cytokine induction by Bifidobacteria is a strain-dependent property.",4945d3c5-9dca-4bf8-9c93-9650abdf0675
55,discussion9,"79 Bifidobacteria have been found to adhere to human intestinal cells and human mucus in vitro81,82 allowing a close interaction with the immune system. Our results indicate an association of these commensal bacteria with inflammation in epilepsy patients and that a decrease of these may alleviate seizures. Thus, patients with higher abundance of members of the B. longum cluster and higher levels of TNF may be more likely to benefit from KD treatment. While several studies have shown a direct induction of cytokines in vitro by Bifidobacteria, we cannot exclude the possibility that this association may be a result of Bifidobacterial communication via the vagus nerve. It has been demonstrated in mice that B. longum NCC3001 could impact the brain by communication via the vagus nerve.83  Bifidobacteria are in general regarded as health promoting bacteria important for development of a eubiotic gut35 and the development of the immune system in early childhood.84 However, a specific B.",3c45b61c-080e-4710-a5fa-f217e9f1ea33

It is intriguing to find early life associated bacteria lingering in the gut of older children with epilepsy. A similar finding in children with autism spectrum disorder (autism spectrum disorder (ASD)) was recently published.86 Wan et al. demonstrated a persistent underdevelopment of the gut microbiota in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to neurotypical age-matched peers. Interestingly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy are common comorbidities.

57,discussion11," Further studies should investigate the role of Bifidobacterial species in larger cohorts including adult patients with epilepsy. Most studies investigating microbial changes in the intestine during KD treatment of epilepsy were performed in children. Comparative whole genome sequencing and in vitro characterization of members of both Bifido clusters identified in our study should contribute to our understanding of the functional differences of these subspecies and their role in human health.  Recently, indications that modulation of the gut microbiota could be used to treat epilepsy was found in animal studies as well as limited human studies using either fecal microbila transfers or probiotic treatment.87, 88, 89, 90, 91 Our study suggests that the reduction of specific Bifidobacteria may reduce seizures in children with refractory epilepsy.

Nonetheless, we were able to confirm various previous publications, e.g., the increase in relative abundance of E. coli and Bacteroides sp., as well as the decrease of Bifidobacteria, IL-17A and TNF during KD. We were able to identify new inflammation-related peptides influenced by KD including those expressed in the gut epithelium and correlating to gut microbes. By combining a panel of inflammatory peptides and measurements of fecal microbiota in our study, we were able to identify known interactions in a new context, i.e., in drug-resistant epilepsy patients, thus, identifying new roles for these interactions.

59,discussion13,"85 However, the finding that these Bifidobacteria and TNF were higher in responders before starting KD, especially in older patients, and both decreased during dietary treatment, is novel and may indicate a dysregulation of the gut microbiota in these patients where Bifidobacteria, typically associated with an immature microbiota, are still present and may uphold a certain level of TNF-associated inflammation that could contribute to the higher systemic inflammation triggering the onset of seizures or worsening of seizures. The finding that responders had higher Bifidobacteria and TNF posed the question whether there were differences in baseline nutrient intake before diet. Calculations on consumption of fats, proteins and carbohydrates showed no significant differences between responders and non-responders. Neither was the ratio of fats to proteins and carbohydrates different in relation to response.",4861b217-bc92-4ff0-a4d9-b3377691723d
60,discussion14," Thus, differences in macronutrient intake at time of diet start is not likely to explain our findings.  In our study, we only analysed changes in the gut microbiota and inflammation in patient serum. We do not have any data on molecular changes in the brain that might explain the seizure reduction observed. Olson et al. showed that KD treatment of mice reduced seizures through increases in the GABA/glutamate levels in the brain and that a gut microbiota was necessary for this effect.92 While TNF may decrease the GABA/glutamate levels in the brain, we can only speculate that this may happen in our cohort. Another possibility is that the overall reduction in systemic inflammation seen in all patients contributes to seizure relief. Downstream consequences may be different for responders and non-responders, e.g., different molecular changes in the brain influenced by the individual cause of epilepsy.

Treatment with the ketogenic diet reduces both factors, possibly contributing to seizure alleviation. Other inflammatory peptides such as IL-12B, CCL3 and CCL4 might be involved but the mechanisms remain unclear. Our study justifies further investigation to confirm whether either B. longum/breve, TNF or both might be useful biomarkers to identify potential responders to KD treatment prior to treatment initiation. In addition, either targeting members of the B. longum cluster, TNF or both might reduce seizures without KD treatment.
