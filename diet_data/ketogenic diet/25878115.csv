0,background0,"Epileptic encephalopathy is a group of neurological disorders characterized by severe and progressive cognitive and behavioral impairments, which are most probably caused or worsened by epileptic activity [1]. Heterozygous mutations in the GNAO1 gene (MIM*139311), encoding the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), were first described as a cause of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE)) in 2013 [2]. Subsequent reports have broadened the spectrum of clinical presentation [3–5] which includes prominent dyskinesia and intellectual disability with few or no seizures (4) and the condition is currently classified as early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE)17 (MIM #615473). Interestingly, all the cases reported to date involve female subjects despite the disease-causing gene maps to chromosome 16q13.",c1f73fc0-1b14-4d8d-bb92-dc8f8dc1b21e
1,background1,"  The GNAO1 gene product is the alpha subunit of Go, a member of the G-protein family, involved in cellular signal transduction. Three functional G-protein subtypes are defined, namely inhibitory G-proteins (Gi), stimulatory G-proteins (Gs) and “other” (Go) the latter being abundantly expressed in the brain [6]. Typically, G-proteins are characterized by their alpha subunit, which binds and hydrolyzes GTP and interacts with specific GPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)s (G-protein coupled receptors) or effector molecules, such as adenylate cyclase. Relevant to neuronal excitability, Go proteins modulate neurotransmitter release by mediating the presynaptic auto-inhibitory effect of several neurotransmitters on their receptors, including M2/M4 muscarinic, alpha(2) adrenergic, mu/delta opioid and GABA-B receptors [7].  We here report the first Spanish girl with this disorder carrying a de novo GNAO1 heterozygous mutation.",17a5a40c-975e-4020-afef-d4826e2db63e

A 4 year-old sister is healthy. Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful. Neonatal physical examination was reportedly normal, with head circumference of 34 cm (35th percentile). Seizures appeared on the third day of life and were tonic generalized or manifested as facial congestion, drooling, or motor phenomena such as sucking, grimacing or winking. They lasted from seconds to a few minutes, recurred up to 40 times per day and were refractory to treatment, including a pyridoxal phosphate-containing vitamin cocktail.  She was referred for study at the age of 3 months.",c6b9d115-c303-4c3a-8416-0027b836bfc9

16,results2," The Leu199Pro mutation was introduced with CHIMERA [14]. The Leu199Pro mutation site is located in the GTPase domain of Gαo, specifically residing in the interior of a β-sheet that is packed between the N- and C-termini and interacting with adjacent α-helices. According to the homology model of human Gαo, Leu199 is not involved in GDP/GTP binding so its mutation to proline is not predicted to directly affect ligand binding or hydrolysis (see Fig. 3a).Fig. 3  a Homology model of human WT Gαo.

Using a conversion factor of 0.73 to convert from Rosetta Energy Units to kcal/mol [12], the predicted ddG of Leu199Pro is +6.1 kcal/mol. This suggests the mutation has a destabilizing effect on the protein and could possibly cause defects in its folding. To investigate this effect in more detail, both the WT protein and Leu199Pro mutant were subjected to a 1 μ-second MD simulation using ACEMD [13].",41dcb353-f6b7-403f-869a-43e73105c164
18,results4," During these simulations, the WT protein remains stable in terms of both its secondary and tertiary structure with an RMSD that fluctuates between 1.0 and 2.0 Å (Fig. 3d). However the Leu199Pro mutant displays significant structural change in its GTPase domain, with multiple H-bonding in its central B-sheet broken, causing the creation of a large flexible loop region and increased positional fluctuation (Fig. 3c), with a protein RMSD of 1.5–3.0 Å across the simulation (Fig. 3d). In addition, the mutation also affects other areas of the domain, in particular α-helices: 208–217 and 257–262, both which lose their structural integrity and experience greater positional fluctuation during the simulation (Fig. 3c).  In the context of the protein as a whole, heat-map representations of positional fluctuation reveal structural disturbances across both domains, GTPase and helical, in the mutant Leu199Pro protein (see Fig. 4).",23af9534-4b39-4d94-924e-f9b7b0dcc6f6

Based on the loss of calcium-current inhibition found in vitro in GNAO1 mutants, resulting from altered Gαo -mediated signaling induced by norepinephrine, Nakamura et al. suggested the use of selective calcium-channel blockers or the use of the high-voltage activated calcium channels modulator topiramate to alleviate epilepsy in patients with GNAO1 mutations [2].

In our present work, we investigated the effect of the novel p. Leu199Pro mutation in the structure of the human Gαo protein using state-of-the-art computational tools. These provide evidence that the mutation causes significant defects in protein stability. The observed disturbances occur locally in the GTPase domain where the mutation is situated but also in several loop regions throughout the protein. This suggests the p.Leu199Pro mutation decreases overall structural stability and perhaps folding of the Gαo protein. From a functional point of view, the location of the p.Leu199Pro mutation may be particularly significant in terms of interactions Gαo makes with its binding partner Gβϒ and others.",0aea8417-6150-4121-9a04-49db6fa77c14
27,discussion7," With respect to the crystal structure of the complete heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide-binding protein Gi (PDB id: 1GG2), when the Gαo subunit is superimposed, the mutation p.Leu199Pro is in direct contact with Gβϒ (see Fig. 1b). Therefore any introduced structural instability in this interface would likely adversely affect the stability of the Gαβϒ complex as a whole. From the observed results, it is certainly conceivable that the p.Leu199Pro mutation could generate this level of instability. The issue of a female gender bias in this disorder deserves special consideration. A distorted sex ratio can be found in many complex disorders, for instance autism spectrum disorder [28] and a male-biased effect has been described for 16p13.11 copy number variants as predisposing factor to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders [29].",12b430ab-0087-4035-a6b6-973d9469f3bb
28,discussion8," Possible causes include hormonal factors, sexual dimorphic brain differences, imprinting or genetic modifiers, with a net effect of greater protection of the female brain. It is conceivable that the penetrance of GNAO1 mutation is higher in the less resilient male brain thus producing a more severe phenotype. While female bias in early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE)-17 remains unexplained, it could be posited that disruption of G-protein signal transduction may lead to prenatal lethality in males.  Conclusions We describe a further female patient with GNAO1-associated neonatal-onset epilepsy and a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Seizures were amenable to treatment with KD. Structural analysis of the novel mutation suggests it introduces significant structural instability into both the Gαo subunit and the whole G-protein heterotrimeric complex.",55dafa21-1d20-43ca-973f-2487b1c953ae
