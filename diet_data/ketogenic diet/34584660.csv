0,background0," The prevalence of sarcopenic obesity (SO) is increasing worldwide, posing important challenges to public health and national health care system, especially during the COVID pandemic. In subjects with SO, it is essential to reduce body weight, and to preserve lean mass, to avoid worsening of muscle function. Adequate nutrition and correct physical activity is essential to counteract SO progression. Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)), a well-established nutritional intervention for obesity, has been also indicated for the treatment of SO. To date, the effects of physical training during Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) have not been investigated.  Aim  This pilot study aims to determine the efficacy of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) combined with interval training, compared to a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) alone, on weight-loss, body composition, and physical performance in participants with SO.

1,methods0," Study design  This was an open, nutritional intervention, pilot study that enrolled participants with SO among those attending the Center for the Study of Eating Disorders and Obesity, Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Medical Pathophysiology, Food Science, and Endocrinology of the University of Rome “La Sapienza,” Italy. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05287659).  Inclusion and exclusion criteria  The inclusion criteria were as follows: women and men, age between 50 and 70 years old, body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 kg/m2 with stable BW in the previous 6 months, WC ≥ 102 cm for men and ≥88 cm for women, sarcopenia, insulin resistance (Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance, HOMA-IR ≥ 2.5) or type 2 diabetes mellitus treated only with metformin.",9856bdef-2203-4dd8-885f-f8c1ddefc9d9
2,methods1,"  The presence of SO was considered when the following conditions were satisfied:  - FM > 39–41% for woman and > 29–31% for man, according to ESPEN and European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) Consensus Statement (5).  - Five times Sit-to-Stand Chair test > 15 s according to EWGOP2 (14).  - Short physical performance battery (Short physical performance battery (SPPB)) < 8, according to EWGSOP2 (14).  The exclusion criteria were the following conditions: lack of informed consent, hypersensitivity to components of meals replacement, type 1 diabetes; cell failure in type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin therapy or concomitant use of sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors,",f6f3cf7e-16db-4ac2-942e-f2f42c1c738d

Anthropometric assessment  Body weight, height, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), WC, and hip circumference (HC) were measured at T0 and at the end of the protocol. Anthropometric measurements were recorded after an overnight fast under resting conditions using calibrated equipment. BW was measured using a balance-beam scale (Seca GmbH & Co, Hamburg, Germany). WC was measured midway between the costal arch and the iliac crest and HC was measured at the symphysis-greater trochanter level to the closest 1 cm (16). Height was rounded to the closest 0.5 cm.",4be62773-4948-4590-bd23-da14d8127c03
4,methods3," body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by squared height in meters (kg/m2). Systolic and diastolic BP were measured using a mercury-gravity manometer.  Blood and urine chemistry  In accordance with the Society of Endocrinology (SIE) Position Statement of the Caprio et al. (11), blood tests [blood count, electrolytes, glucose, insulin, lipids, total proteins and albumin, plasma creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (blood urea nitrogen (BUN)) and uric acid, alanine transferase, aspartate transaminase, and Vitamin D levels] were performed before starting the protocol and after 6 weeks of diet therapy with meal replacements. Insulin resistance was determined using HOMA-IR (17). Estimation of the concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in plasma, without use of the preparative ultracentrifuge was determined at the beginning and at the end of the protocol (18).",10a1b0ba-1372-4403-a8c3-99322bb3da16
5,methods4," eGFR was calculated with Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)) (19). β-Hydroxybutyrate capillary blood levels were tested at the beginning of the study, every 2 weeks and at the end of the study, through a portable glucometer (GlucoMen LX Sensor, A. Menarini Diagnostics, Neuss, Germany; sensitivity < 0.2 mmol/L). The threshold value for nutritional ketosis was set at 0.5 mmol/L (20).  Body composition  Body composition was measured through multifrequency Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), Human Im Touch, DS Medica, Milan, Italy) at baseline and after 6 weeks (12). The Human Im Touch device records impedance at five frequencies (5, 10, 50, 100, and 250 kHz). During Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), patients were lying supine. All measurements were performed on the patient’s right side. The four-surface standard tetra polar electrodes technique on the foot and hand was used.",e5971f72-5952-46ee-889c-8828c3d2bfe7
6,methods5,"  Muscle strength and physical performance analysis  To evaluate strength, chair stand test (chair stand test (CST)) was performed, as indicated by the ESWGOP2 report (14). chair stand test (CST) measured the amount of time needed for a patient to rise five times from a seated position without using arms: sarcopenia was diagnosed when the patient took more than 15 s to complete the task, as indicated by EWGSOP2 (14). To evaluate physical performance, the Short physical performance battery (SPPB) battery was used, consisting of three components of physical performance: (1) standing balance, (2) chair stands, and (3) gait speed. A score from 0 (poorest) to 4 (best) was assigned for each of these three components. The sum of the scores provided a composite score ranging from 0 to 12; physical performance was considered impaired when the total Short physical performance battery (SPPB) score was ≤ 8 (14).",c6e18214-015a-462b-b4be-c8cb68e819b3
7,methods6,"  Dietary intervention  All patients followed a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) [780–800 kcal/day, with the following composition in macronutrients, percentage of caloric intake, and g/kg of ideal BW of proteins (derived by the body mass index (BMI) set at 25 kg/m2), respectively: carbohydrates 26 g (13.5%), fats 35 g (40.4%) and proteins 80–90 g (1.2–1.4 g/Kg of ideal BW) for 6 weeks] (21). Patients were given four or five meals/day [timing was at main meals (7.30 a.m., 1.00 p.m., and 8.30 p.m.), mid-morning and mid-afternoon]. Supplements of vitamins, minerals and omega-3 fatty acids, were provided in accordance to international recommendations (22). The dietary fat component mainly derived from extra-virgin olive oil (20 g per day); in particular, polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) proportion was 8%, monounsaturated fatty acid (monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)) 77%, and the saturated fats 15%.",51a2807e-69b4-4883-8605-30f275907307
8,methods7," The amount of daily fiber intake was about 25 g/day, as requested from Italian Guidelines (LARN 2014), mostly deriving from the vegetable servings. Participants received counseling by physicians and nutrition experts at baseline (T0) and every 2 weeks up to the end of the protocol (T6); dietary compliance was also assessed with a food frequency questionnaire, every 2 weeks. It was also recommended to drink not less than 2.0–2.5 L of water per day.  Physical training intervention  Seven days after the beginning of the nutritional protocol, the patients enrolled in the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) + IT group started Interval Training (IT) twice a week, with 48–72 recovery hours between sessions (13). Due to the pandemic, physical exercise sessions were carried out via Zoom platform with a personal trainer and each session lasted 30–35 min.",57ed31fe-19de-4c64-afe8-d43cf44b5d15
9,methods8," Each session of physical exercise was structured as follows: an initial part of warm up, breathing and stretching, a second part based on functional exercises repeated for 20 s with a 10 s pause, a part of proprioception and balance, and finally a part focused on breathing. The required home-based equipment consisted of a chair with a backrest and without armrests, two bottles of water and a towel. Functional exercises proposed were changed every week; timing schedule was also modified, with an increase in exercise time and a decrease in recovery time.

24,discussion0," To date, there are still no clear indications regarding the type of physical activity to be performed during a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD). In some cases, healthcare providers even suggest that the patient starting a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) protocol should stop physical activity, due to the low calorie and carbohydrate content of the nutritional treatment.  In this study, we demonstrated that a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) combined with physical IT from the very beginning of the protocol improved body composition by reducing FM and preserving fat free mass (FFM) to a greater extent than Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) alone. Importantly, patients following Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) showed a significant increase in muscle strength and function after 6-weeks of treatment, independently of IT, as shown in Figure 3. As shown in a recent study by Romano et al.",4aa9dd95-b1c5-4334-a7ec-b96ba4e9871a
25,discussion1," (24), a reduction in fat free mass (FFM), more specifically in lean mass, has been observed during Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes, but this variation was limited to the beginning of the nutritional protocol, whereas, only a loss of FM was observed subsequently. In keeping with this, as observed in a previous study by Merra et al. (25), Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) was effective as a dietary approach determining a reduction in BW, FM and fat free mass (FFM) maintenance, in patients with obesity. In general, skeletal muscle loss may occur in the context of BW reduction during a hypocaloric diet (26), and an increase in muscle proteolysis has been suggested to play a role in muscle mass reduction under calorie restriction. Data obtained in these studies confirm that Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD), albeit a slight reduction in initial lean mass, results in a preservation of skeletal mass.",04738f11-2e24-4df5-b6ee-2f886198535b
26,discussion2," In addition, our study evaluated the role of physical training during a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) protocol. These results, although preliminary and observed in a limited number of patients, confirm that it is essential to combine physical training during the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) protocol in order to maintain fat free mass (FFM). Furthermore, the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) + IT group did not experience any significant reduction in basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body cell mass (BCM), and the preservation of fat free mass (FFM), despite the caloric deficit, was determined by physical training.  FIGURE 3 Box plot of pooled ranking of observed relative differences (% variation vs. basal values) from T0 to T6 in Chair stand test in Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) and Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) + IT groups.  In both groups, physical performance was significantly increased, irrespective of physical training.",43171e5b-b69b-4814-bcf3-6cdcc3072d57
27,discussion3," We speculate that the improvement in physical performance was mainly explained by the relevant weight loss in both groups, together with the improved nutritional and inflammatory status. Of note, we failed to observe an improvement of physical performance in the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) IT group. It is possible that the tests used in this study were not the most appropriate to highlight potential advantages due to physical training.  It is well-known, as reported in a study by Frank et al. (27), that physical activity is directly related to cardiometabolic health. In fact, 150 min of physical activity have a positive impact on reducing body mass index (BMI) and increasing high density lipoprotein (HDL) plasma levels. Remarkably, we did observe a significant increase of high density lipoprotein (HDL) plasma levels only in the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)-IT group (p = 0.002).",6e4fd4be-9bfb-483b-a68c-2bdeca0d0654
28,discussion4," This was not observed in patients following Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) alone.  In our study, a significant improvement in all metabolic parameters was observed, independently of the physical training.  In addition, an increase in vitamin D levels was found in both Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) and Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) + IT groups (p = 0.002 and p = 0.003, respectively). As already reported in many studies, subjects with obesity have low vitamin D levels, as it is sequestered in fat cells (28, 29). Whenever a reduction in BW and FM occurs, there is an upward trend in Vitamin D levels, with favorable effects of metabolic and endothelial function (30).  The Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) was safe and well-tolerated for 6-weeks; in fact, a significant reduction in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine was observed in both groups, together with a mild improvement in eGFR.",e5dd983c-1587-4c6d-adb9-824f9d522e6a
29,discussion5," These results, confirm that Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) is safe and does not lead to a worsening of renal function in patients with visceral obesity and sarcopenia.  However, we still remind that Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) is a nutritional approach requiring strict medical surveillance. Our pilot study has several limitations: first of all the number of participants enrolled was small, although sufficient to appreciate the changes induced by Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD). The short duration of the study protocol represents a further limitation, together with the lack of follow-up. Furthermore, due to the pandemic, physical training was performed via the Zoom platform: in-person exercise would certainly have been even more accurate in terms of control of the quality of exercise performance. Body composition analysis was performed by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), and not by DXA.",15671673-514a-492d-8e08-76c72924c865
30,discussion6," Finally, a further limitation of our study is represented by the lack of individualized training intensity; in fact, only Borg’s RPE scale was used at the end of each training session to test the perception of fatigue (31, 32).  Conclusion  Evidence supporting the beneficial impact of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) on adipose and skeletal muscle metabolism in the management of obesity is increasing. In patients with obesity, this dietary approach markedly improved lipid and glycemic profiles, with proven cardiometabolic protective effects.
