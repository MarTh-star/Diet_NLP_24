Subjects In order to obtain the population sample, we contacted the main state-wide MS associations, which informed their members about the nature of the study. The following selection criteria were applied to the 35 people interested in participating in the study: patients over 18 years of age diagnosed with MS at least 6 months ago and treated with glatiramer acetate and interferon beta. Moreover, the exclusion criteria included: pregnant or breastfeeding women, patients with tracheotomy, stoma or with short bowel syndrome, patients with dementia, evidence of alcohol or drug abuse, with myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, symptoms of angina or other heart conditions, patients with kidney conditions with creatinine levels two times higher than normal markers, patients with elevated liver markers three times higher than normal or with chronic liver disease,",7e8782ee-6796-40e7-8837-7d5bf857926e

Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS v.23 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) tool. The first step aimed to estimate the distribution of the variables investigated through statistical methods for the assessment of normality, including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. This analysis demonstrated the non-normal distribution of all the scale variables studied. Therefore, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess changes before and after the intake of the study diet. Categorical data were analysed with a chi-square test. Finally, a two-tailed Spearman’s test was employed for correlation analysis. A p-value below 0.05 was considered significant. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or the number of patients and percentage.  2.3.",e5df0b73-40ed-456e-b0eb-eba16b8f42d1
2,methods2," Procedure Once the sample was obtained, the volunteers and their families received detailed information on the study. They were also given instructions to not change their lifestyle habits throughout the 4 months of the duration of the study. They were provided with information on the characteristics of a ketogenic diet and their obligation to follow it over the 4-month period. Once these requirements were accepted, the participants signed an informed consent form. In order to verify that the patients complied with the treatment, weekly telephone calls were made in which they were asked about any doubts and problems in following the diet.  2.4. Intervention Once each participant had been assessed, a ketogenic diet was designed by using the nutritional-dietary software “Nutrition and Health” version 2.0® (University of Granada, Granada, Spain). This diet was given for a 4-month period and was adapted to the individual characteristics of each participant.",b54780d7-f8e3-474d-a898-a0b7a17c7f8d
3,methods3," It consisted of an isocaloric diet with 5 meals a day: breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner. The percentage distribution of the 3 main macronutrients with respect to the total caloric value of the diet was as follows: 20% proteins, 40% carbohydrates and 40% lipids. The diet was based on promoting healthy food and avoiding ultra-processed products. Thus, foods with a high content of rapidly-digested simple sugars (dairy desserts, juices, chocolate bars and soft drinks), unhealthy fats (cold meats and pastries) and with a high level of salt and additives (snacks) were avoided. In addition, the consumption of alcohol, both fermented and distilled, was not considered. Foods rich in proteins of a high biological value of animal origin were included, such as lean meat, white and oily fish, eggs, seafood and dairy and healthy derivatives (yoghurt and cheese).",938ec552-60d3-498d-b57a-d3c436e40b8d
4,methods4," Proteins of vegetable origin cooked in a healthy way and roasted or raw nuts without salt were also included. In order to guarantee sufficient vitamins, minerals and fibre, the consumption of low glycaemic vegetables and fruits and slowly-digested complex carbohydrates were included, preferably a wholemeal whenever possible (rice, pasta, legumes, tubers) and cooked in a healthy way.  Regarding the diet’s lipid panel, which corresponds to 20% of the total caloric value, it was distributed as follows: 65.69% saturated fatty acids, 19.64% monounsaturated fatty acids and 14.77% polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, the diet provided a total daily amount of 232.41 mg of cholesterol and 38.74 g of fibre. Finally, with the aim of achieving a ketogenic state, a total of 60 mL of coconut oil was provided on a daily basis (30 mL of coconut oil for breakfast and 30 mL for lunch). The lipid panel of the 60 mL of coconut oil was as follows: 91.84% saturated fatty acids, 6.",c7af975a-6886-4db4-8e9f-8117020c343d

Measurements The following measurements were taken before and after the 4-month intervention, in the same conditions and by the same researcher assigned to the study.  Nutritional and dietary anamnesis: Just before starting the study, a nutritional and dietary anamnesis was carried out for each patient with the Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) [44]. This tool made it possible to determine how often foods belonging to different groups were consumed: dairy products, vegetables, fruits, juices, nuts, meat, fish, seafood, eggs, tubers, rice, legumes, pasta, cold meats and sausages, snacks, pastries and biscuits, chocolate bars, soft drinks, fermented alcohol and distilled alcohol.",21f58661-c0d2-435e-a8e4-743644462ebf

Blood test and marker analysis: A blood test was carried out at 9 a.m. on an empty stomach, then the serum was separated from the plasma after centrifuging the samples. The bodies mainly beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels were measured with a commercial kit (Randox Laboratories, Crumlin, UK) and PON1 activity by using 4-Nitrophenyl acetate [46]. In both cases, an automated clinical biochemistry analyser (Olympus A 400, Tokyo, Japan) was used. Ghrelin was quantified by means of a commercial method, ELISA kit (BioVendor, Asheville, NC, USA).  Appetite Assessment: Participants completed an appetite questionnaire for one whole day, immediately before eating a meal and again after 2 h (breakfast, lunch and dinner).",35398d3f-7b00-4269-8d15-3532bba08b12
8,methods8," The appetite questionnaire used a visual analogue scale (visual analogue scale (VAS)), which has been found to be a reliable and valid tool for appetite assessment [47]. This questionnaire included eight questions followed by 10 cm horizontal lines, where 0 represented “sensation not felt at all” and 10 represented “sensation strongly felt”. Subjects were asked to mark the line at the point which corresponded to how they were feeling at that particular time. The questionnaire was developed by Parker et al. [48] to assess human appetite. The distance from the beginning of the line to the participants’ mark was measured from the left-hand side.  2.6.

Results This study analysed a sample of 27 MS patients with a comparable proportion of patients of the different types of MS accepted at present and a mean age of 44.56 years (Table 1).  3.1. Dietary Habits of the Study Population According to this study’s data, the study population’s dietary habits before the intervention were based on a high intake of simple sugars (dairy desserts, juices, pastries, chocolate bars and soft drinks) and a low intake of refined complex carbohydrates (rice and pasta). In addition, fruit and vegetable intake was low, therefore providing little fibre to their diet. Regarding fats, they mainly originated from cold meats, pastries, chocolate bars and snacks.

10,methods10," Change in Satiety Perception and bodies mainly beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) Production Once the intervention had finished, a significant change in the increase in satiety perception before and after lunch and dinner was observed. However, this variation was not observed at breakfast. bodies mainly beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels in the blood significantly increased (Table 3).  3.3. Percentage Changes in Fat and Muscle and PON1 Levels Regarding body composition, a change characterised by a significant increase in lean mass, as well as a significant decrease in fat mass, was observed. Likewise, a significant increase of PON1 in the blood was found (Table 3, Figure 1).  3.4. Changes in Hunger Perception and Ghrelin Secretion After the intervention, hunger perception showed lower scores before and after lunch and dinner. Nonetheless, this change was not observed at breakfast time, where perception was similar to that of before the study.",a6e5593a-eec3-4d1f-8525-499d0fa04889
11,methods11," Regarding hunger perception assessed through the blood values of ghrelin, no changes were observed after treatment (Table 3).  4. Discussion Due to pathogenesis based mainly on energy alteration at a mitochondrial level, patients with MS express a worsening of physical function [4,50], decreasing their muscle mass [51]. An alternative treatment is to restore this mitochondrial activity. For this reason, our study prescribed a ketogenic diet for 4 months. According to literature, this is the first study to address the possible improvements in body composition, oxidation state and metabolism in MS patients, based on the satiating effect of a Mediterranean isocaloric diet rich in fats with a high MCT content.",6a1edd9f-ba53-47a7-88e0-9afc527744a5
12,methods12,"  In general, our results coincide with those of other studies, which indicate that ketone bodies can be a good alternative to improve motor function, not only as a result of their neuroprotective properties analysed by other authors [9,10,11] but also due to the metabolic impact based mainly on the satiating effect related to weight loss with an increase in lean mass [25,26]. In particular, there was a significant increase in bodies mainly beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in serum after our intervention, alongside an increase in lean mass and a decrease in fat mass, which in both cases were significant. In addition, possibly as a result of an anthropometric profile change, there was a significant increase in PON1 levels, a marker associated with low levels of oxidative stress and inflammation.",23b0c365-0b74-407f-92a2-6982208a04bf
13,methods13," This could be due to an improvement in the total antioxidant status in the blood, already evidenced especially after intake of certain nutrients, such as fruit and vegetables, present in large quantities in the Mediterranean diet, and precisely by promoting higher production of PON1 in the liver [52]. In this sense, the ketogenesis induced in our study has a Mediterranean diet base. This fact could increase the antioxidant activity, which has already been observed after only a three-week ketogenic diet [53,54]. The changes obtained in our study after a four-month intervention imply a variation in the organism’s preference for ketones as a fuel (especially bodies mainly beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB)). This was already observed a few weeks after prescribing a ketogenic diet [55,56].  As previously mentioned, the satiating effect of ketone bodies [19,20] could have a relevant role in improving the aforementioned anthropometric improvements.",535c4f69-27f9-444d-a891-b57c94853aaa
14,methods14," In this sense, and as indicated in previous research [19,20], this study showed a significant increase in satiety. In addition, this effect also saw a lower hunger perception. Nonetheless, ghrelin, the hormone directly related to hunger [57], maintained levels similar to those that patients had before starting the intervention. This discrepancy could be due to the relationship between bodies mainly beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) secretion and the hormone. In accordance with our results, another study [58] showed how ghrelin levels do not vary in the blood if ketone body administration is in the long term, specifically 8 weeks, despite a decrease in weight and increase of bodies mainly beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Something similar could be observed when a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet was prescribed for 12 weeks, as there were no variations in ghrelin when fasting, although there was weight loss [59].",ffbe2763-4131-456b-a2b9-e6b9f4a777c0
15,methods15,"  After our intervention, changes in satiety and hunger were before and after lunch and dinner. This was not the case with breakfast. The explanation of these results could be based on the hypothesis that the production of both molecules is related in the short term, and during the day, depends on meals. Recently, a significant decrease in ghrelin in the blood has been shown between 2 and 4 h after timely drinking a ketone ester drink, with a peak increase of bodies mainly beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in the blood after 60 min. This was also associated with an immediate decrease in appetite and the desire to eat after this period of time [39]. In our study, although the levels of ketone bodies and ghrelin were not measured in the different meals to avoid adding stress to the individuals involved in the study, we could say that, based on the aforementioned, due to the use of coconut oil at breakfast and lunch, the highest levels of ketone bodies would be given at lunch and dinner.",079f1886-829b-424d-8f2c-1914ca027455
16,methods16," The same applied to the lowest levels of ghrelin. Therefore, this would explain the feeling of satiety and lack of hunger before and after both meals. In this sense, by not using coconut oil for dinner and after not eating for 8 h, the highest levels of ghrelin in the blood would most likely be produced just before breakfast on an empty stomach. Regarding bodies mainly beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and its relation to the lack of satiety before and after breakfast, despite an increase in bodies mainly beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) after treatment, it is possibly due to the organism adapting itself to use that source of energy [55,56] that the impact on satiety does not occur before and after breakfast. The peaks after coconut oil intake at breakfast and lunch caused satiety at lunch and dinner. Another aspect that could have an influence on the differences in satiety and hunger observed, among the three main meals, are the changes in dietary habits and nutrients.",ecbed3b3-3267-4281-95b0-276045ce42b6
17,methods17," Regarding dietary habits, patients mainly had four meals a day before the study. However, patients had five meals a day during the intervention. This could have had an influence on satiety and hunger, as smaller and more regular meals (five per day) are related to less sudden changes in blood sugar and lipemia, as well as an improvement in regulating appetite and satiety sensation [34,35].  In relation to food consumption, alterations in the glycaemic metabolism have been observed in MS patients, related to damage at the mitochondrial level [60] and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation, helping to slow down the progression of the disease [61,62,63]. In addition, fast-digesting simple sugars in the short- and long-term favour appetite and increase intake [32,33], as a rise in insulin leads to an increase in hunger and a decrease in satiety [64] related to a rise in the glycaemic index [65,66].",be1e08f5-06a4-48e4-a8a6-de4fd706e2ab
18,methods18," As a result, this study performed a nutritional change, going from consuming a high intake of carbohydrates, mainly simple sugars, to consuming complex carbohydrates and healthy fats. This would regulate the glycaemic index and, as a result, decrease hunger and increase satiety throughout the day [67,68]. Furthermore, a larger amount of fibre in the diet, in relation to the diet before the study, would favour the regulation of glucose levels and the satiating effect [30], thus explaining the obtained results. Finally, our intervention also included a higher amount of protein than previously consumed and balanced with respect to the other nutrients, which could also contribute to decreasing hunger and increasing satiety [69,70]. In short, comparing the effects of the ketogenic diet on the different organs described in the introduction (Figure 2A), our results after the discussion suggest the contributions that can be seen in Figure 2B.",ec10ee92-1778-4863-a7d3-53cf9b9d2097
19,methods19,"  Despite the fact that our results show evidence of improvement related to the disease and the production of markers related to the perception of satiety and hunger after prescribing a ketogenic diet, the study has a series of limitations. Among such limitations, in addition to a small sample leading to relatively high standard deviations, bodies mainly beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and ghrelin measurements were not taken during the day. Therefore, future research should include a larger sample. Furthermore, bodies mainly beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and ghrelin should be measured during the day, in order to better understand the interaction between the variation levels with the perception of satiety and hunger. Finally, it is necessary to study further the behaviour and role of other molecules and parameters directly related to hunger and satiety, highlighting the glycaemic index.  5.",d85e9a06-4a1b-4c29-871b-41ccaf92b556
20,methods20," Conclusions After the intervention with MS patients had taken place, an increase in lean mass was observed, alongside fat mass loss. These changes could be related to patients’ metabolic profile improvements, evidenced by an increase in PON levels associated with less oxidation and inflammation. Furthermore, a satiating effect was found, alongside a lower feeling of hunger, at lunch and dinner, which could be associated with an increase in bodies mainly beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels and changes in dietary habits. These results indicate that obtaining ketogenesis by consuming a Mediterranean diet rich in MCT fats produces a satiating effect, possibly related to metabolic and anthropometric changes that have a positive impact on the clinical evolution of MS. Consequently, this type of diet may represent a therapeutic alternative by supplementing the pharmacological treatment. However, new studies would be required to confirm the conclusions drawn and the mechanisms proposed. ",8aa1f3a4-6b1d-4a7b-a9b8-c218fca0a770
