0,introduction0," The NIMA-Related Kinase 1 (NEK1) gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase with homology to NIMA (never in mitosis gene-A)1. Homozygous LoF (loss-of-function) NEK1 mutations lead to autosomal-recessive lethal osteochondrodysplasia, a severe early developmental disorder known as short rib polydactyly syndrome type II (short rib polydactyly syndrome type II (SRPS)) in humans2. In addition, NEK1 reduction of function variants such as p.Arg261His has been identified as a risk factor associated with approximately 3% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases3. NEK1 has been implicated in mediating diverse cellular functions, including cell cycle, cilia formation, DNA-damage response, microtubule stability, and neural development4. It remains unclear how NEK1 may mediate these diverse functions at cellular levels; nor is it known why NEK1 deficiency in animals and humans can lead to early developmental disorders.",cf17bd26-479b-465d-9ce5-f42e292f2956
1,introduction1," Nek1Kat2J mutant mice harbor a spontaneous mutation resulting from the insertion of a guanosine residue in the NEK1 kinase coding region which produces a frame shift that results in a premature termination codon (premature termination codon (PTC)) and leads to a null phenotype5. Nek1Kat2J mutant mice exhibit premature lethality and pleiotropic defects such as facial dysmorphism, polycystic kidney disease, craniofacial anomalies, and growth retardation6 and thus, provide a model for investigating the null phenotype of Nek1. Knockdown of Nek1 has been found in a focused siRNA screen to sensitize to RIPK1-dependent apoptosis (RIPK1 dependent apoptosis (RDA)) by promoting the activation of RIPK17. However, the mechanism by which NEK1 regulates RIPK1 is unknown.  RIPK1 is a serine/threonine kinase which functions as a key regulator of cellular responses in cells stimulated by TNF8, 9. RIPK1 contains an N-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate domain, and a C-terminal death domain (DD).",408a45ee-e561-4564-a9f9-c437b254b9b7
2,introduction2," Activation of RIPK1 downstream of TNFR1 signaling plays an important role in promoting programmed cell death via either necroptotic or apoptotic pathway. In TNF stimulated cells, RIPK1 is rapidly recruited into complex I in association with the intracellular DD of TNFR1 where RIPK1 is extensively modulated by ubiquitination and phosphorylation which collectively decides whether RIPK1 is to be activated. RIPK1, once activated, interacts with either FADD and caspase-8 to form complex IIa and mediate RIPK1-dependent-apoptosis (RIPK1 dependent apoptosis (RDA)) or with RIPK3 to form complex IIb and mediate necroptosis. The activation of RIPK1 is extensively modulated by ubiquitination9. A20 is a ubiquitin editing enzyme that is known to modulate Lys63 ubiquitination and activation of RIPK1 to inhibit apoptosis and necroptosis10–12.",6eb43853-22e4-4572-9d35-159ccaca583e
3,introduction3,"  The retromer complexes are highly conserved eukaryotic protein machinery that binds to the cytosolic side of endosomes and mediate retrograde transport from endosomal compartments to the trans‐Golgi network (trans‐Golgi network (TGN)) and the plasma membrane13. The mammalian retromer complex consists of a heterotrimeric core, VPS26, VPS29, and VPS35, in association with a dimer from the sorting nexin (sorting nexin (SNX)) family14. Mammalian cells express two different isoforms of VPS26: VPS26A and VPS26B. Although VPS26B shares marked homology with VPS26A, its C-terminus is distinct and the functional role of VPS26B is unexplored15. Sorting nexin 2 (sorting nexin (SNX)2) is a mammalian ortholog of yeast retromer component VPS5p and involved in intracellular degradative and recycling functions16. The sorting nexin 27 (sorting nexin (SNX)27)-retromer complex is a major regulator of endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling of transmembrane cargos17.",1b98d808-10be-4e27-9374-c9c327d65421
4,introduction4," sorting nexin (SNX)27-retromer maintains the cell surface levels of glucose transporter GLUT1 by preventing its lysosomal degradation18. Reduced retromer function has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, as has decreased glucose metabolism in the brains of patients19. Genome-wide association studies (Genome wide association studies (GWAS)) have identified many variants in the core components of retromer complexes as risk factors in promoting age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD)20. However, it remains unclear how regulation of retromer is involved in neurodegenerative diseases.  Here we investigated the null phenotype of Nek1 and the mechanism by which NEK1 deficiency promotes early lethality using Nek1Kat2J mutant mice. We show that NEK1 regulates retromer-mediated trafficking by directly phosphorylating VPS26B.",82908c46-2f43-41b6-820c-59b888540a59
5,introduction5," NEK1 deficiency impairs retromer-mediated trafficking of plasma membrane proteins such as GLUT1 and promotes metabolic defects. Dysregulated metabolism in Nek1Kat2J cells sensitizes RIPK1 activation by down-regulating A20 which can be inhibited by genetic inactivation of RIPK1 and by metabolic regulation. We demonstrate that the postnatal lethality of Nek1Kat2J mutant mice is mediated by BBB damage involving both RIPK1 dependent apoptosis (RDA) and necroptosis of cerebrovascular endothelial cells, which can be rescued by either inhibiting RIPK1 activation or rescuing metabolic defects with a ketogenic diet.

25,results0," Rescue of BBB damage in Nek1Kat2J mice by RIPK1 inhibition  We first analyzed the expression pattern of NEK1 in the central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)) using immunostaining with anti-NEK1 antibody. In the mouse spinal cord, NEK1 was found in the NeuN+ neurons in the ventral and lateral horns (Supplementary Fig. 1a). A large fraction of ChAT+ motor neurons in the ventral horn of wild type (WT) spinal cords were NEK1+ (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In addition, NEK1 was detected in CD31+ endothelial cells and IBA1+ microglia in WT mouse brains (Supplementary Fig. 1c-d). The immunostaining signal of NEK1 was absent in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J mouse brains, consistent with the null phenotype of this mutant line5.  As reported, approximately half of Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J newborn pups die before weaning age6: the percentage of surviving Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J pups at 2 weeks of age from intercrosses of Nek1Kat2J/+ mice was only 13.7%.",4dc57872-eae8-474c-9fe7-7492c9155e67
26,results1," The remaining pups also died early: 6 of the 7 surviving Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J pups died between 2 to 4 weeks of age and the last one died before 6 weeks of age (Fig. 1a, b). To examine the role of RIPK1 in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J mice, we generated Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J;Ripk1D138N/D138N mice by crossing Nek1Kat2J/+ mice with RIPK1 kinase-dead knock-in Ripk1D138N/D138N mice21. The survival of Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J;Ripk1D138N/D138N newborns was increased compared to that of Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J newborns: Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J;Ripk1D138N/D138N newborns account for 20% of the total littermates that survived past 2 weeks (25% is expected based on Mendelian ratios), compared to 13.7% of littermate Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J newborns. Among the 15 surviving Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J;Ripk1D138N/D138N mice, 8 died before 6 weeks, the remaining 7 Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J;Ripk1D138N/D138N mice survived more than 5 months until they had to be euthanized due to malocclusion caused by craniofacial abnormality between the ages of 5 to 11 months (Fig. 1a, b).",627e419a-b6a3-4fda-a550-73fd419add94

Inhibition of RIPK1, however, did not affect the polycystic kidney development, dwarfism, or facial deformity in this mutant line (Supplementary Fig. 1e-g). Inhibition of RIPK1 did not rescue the reduced body weight in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J;Ripk1D138N/D138N mice at 2 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. 1h). While inhibition of RIPK1 rescued the lethality of Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J mice to allow their survival, the body weight of Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J;Ripk1D138N/D138N mice at 5 months of age was still lower than that of WT or Ripk1D138N/D138N mice (Supplementary Fig. 1i).

Knockdown of Nek1 using shRNA also sensitized RGC5 cells and L929 cells to RIPK1 dependent apoptosis (RDA) and necroptosis, which was protected by RIPK1 inhibition with Nec-1s (Supplementary Fig. 2d-f). Thus, Nek1 deficiency sensitizes MEFs to both RIPK1 dependent apoptosis (RDA) and necroptosis.  Downregulation of A20 in Nek1Kat2J cells  We next characterized the mechanism by which Nek1 deficiency sensitizes to RIPK1-dependent cell death by analyzing the components of the TNFR1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC or complex I) which forms rapidly in TNF-stimulated cells and is crucial in determining cell fate24. Interestingly, we found that the levels of A20 recruited to complex I were much lower in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J cells relative to that of WT (Fig. 2a).",15d19298-d317-417a-a8b3-523a04ee197e

Using an in vitro kinase assay, we found that VPS26B could be directly phosphorylated by NEK1 in vitro, and this phosphorylation was Ser302/Ser304 dependent as the phosphorylation was blocked by VPS26B-S302A/S304A mutation (Fig. 4f).  We next investigated the functional significance of VPS26B phosphorylation by NEK1. Although the overall structure of VPS26B is highly similar to VPS26A, VPS26B contains an unique conformationally flexible “tail” (a.a. residues 297-336) that extends from the center of the protein, which has no structural information available43. We found that the C-terminus of VPS26B is important for binding between VPS26B and sorting nexin (SNX)27 as a truncation of VPS26B that lacks the C-terminal 298-336 residues bound poorly with endogenous sorting nexin (SNX)27 (Supplementary Fig. 4i).",d67ac97b-b80c-42f7-8dee-f86c73be2734

NEK1 deficiency disrupts glucose uptake  sorting nexin (SNX)27-retromer is known to mediate the transport of glucose transport 1 (GLUT1) from endosomes to the plasma membrane18. We compared the levels of GLUT1 protein in plasma membrane after cell-surface biotinylation in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J and WT MEFs. We found that the plasma membrane distribution of GLUT1 in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J MEFs was much lower than WT MEFs (Fig. 5a).",627a0c81-3c72-4aec-a5f5-4a1eeb354afe
57,results32," The reduced plasma membrane localization of GLUT1 in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J MEFs was further confirmed by immunostaining (Fig. 5b, c). Reduced plasma membrane presence of GLUT1 was not affected by treatment of Nec-1s (Supplementary Fig. 5a), which is consistent with the model that activation of RIPK1 is downstream of retromer defects in Nek1 deficient cells.  The reduced plasma membrane levels of GLUT1 in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J MEFs were restored by the expression of WT NEK1 but not NEK1D146N, a kinase dead mutant of NEK1, suggesting the importance of NEK1 kinase activity in regulating the trafficking of GLUT1 (Supplementary Fig. 5b). To assess if the phosphorylation of VPS26B at Ser302/Ser304 affects the localization of GLUT1 on plasma membrane, we expressed VPS26BWT, VPS26BS302A/S304A and VPS26BS302D/S304D in HeLa cells. The expression of VPS26BWT and VPS26BS302D/S304D promoted the localization of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5d, e).",c075fe27-053d-42b7-a4b4-86b34d47a974
58,results33," In Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J MEFs, the expression of VPS26BS302D/S304D, but not VPS26BWT or VPS26BS302A/S304A, promoted the localization of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5f, g). Thus, the phosphorylation of VPS26B Ser302/Ser304 by NEK1 is important to shuttle GLUT1 from endosomes to the plasma membrane. Taken together, Nek1 deficiency may inhibit the recycling of sorting nexin (SNX)27-retromer from plasma membrane back to endosome which makes it unavailable to deliver additional GLUT1 from endosome to cell surface membrane.  We next analyzed the functional consequences of reduced plasma membrane presence of GLUT1 using 13C6-labelled glucose uptake. We found that Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J MEFs showed dramatically reduced levels of 13C6-glucose uptake as well as 13C-labelled downstream metabolites of 13C6-glucose compared to WT MEFs in fast 13C-labelling experiment (Fig. 5h).",1badac62-5b5f-4d87-ba75-f6b93954af3b
59,results34," Longer term 13C-labelling experiment also demonstrated the reduction in the levels of pyruvate in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 5c). With reduced precursor metabolites such as pyruvate from glycolysis, the TCA activity of Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J MEFs was also compromised, which were evidenced by the reduced oxygen consumption rate in seahorse analysis (Supplementary Fig. 5d), reduced levels of acetyl-coA (Supplementary Fig. 5e) and reduced levels of ATP (Supplementary Fig. 5f). Consistent with reduced glucose uptake and the activation of starvation response, Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J MEFs showed higher levels of p-S79 ACC, a substrate of AMPK, than that of WT (Supplementary Fig. 5g). The levels of p-S79 ACC in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J and WT MEFs were elevated to the same levels when treated with metformin, which is known to activate AMPK44 (Supplementary Fig. 5g). Treatment with Nec-1s had no effect on the levels of p-ACC (Supplementary Fig. 5h).",b4607a58-8f0b-4d38-97cc-491305bdfaa0
60,results35," Thus, AMPK is likely activated in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J MEFs due to inadequate glucose uptake. These results suggest that NEK1 deficiency disrupts retromer-mediated trafficking which in turn impairs glucose uptake due to reduced GLUT1 in plasma membrane and leads to metabolic defects upstream of RIPK1.

Glucose is an important source of acetyl-CoA for cells. Consistent with inadequate glucose uptake in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J cells, we found the acetyl-CoA levels were also lower in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J cells (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Since the levels of acetyl-CoA, an important donor of acetyl-group, can regulate the acetylation of A20 protein and reduced acetylation of A20 protein ptomotes its lysosomal degradation51, we examined the levels of acetylated A20 in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J cells and whether ALCAR and sodium octanoate could upregulate A20. Consistent with the decreased acetyl-CoA levels, the acetylation of A20 protein was much lower in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J cells (Supplementary Fig. 6i).",87c10b38-fa69-4d24-ab43-db9cf14a6914

Thus, by regulating VSP26B phosphorylation, NEK1 may control the flux and direction of intracellular retromer trafficking. Blocking of S302/S304 VPS26B phosphorylation in NEK1 deficient cells inhibits the recycling of sorting nexin (SNX)27- and sorting nexin (SNX)2-retromers which distorts the cellular distribution of the retromer components and substrates that include increased plasma membrane levels of sorting nexin (SNX)27 and decreased plasma membrane levels of sorting nexin (SNX)2, as well as at least 79 other known substrates of the retromer, such as the critical glucose receptor GLUT1 (Fig. 8).",4a11db06-3623-4784-92de-c306c377fa79

NEK1 deficiency blocks the recycling of sorting nexin (SNX)27-retromer from cell surface to endosomes.

77,discussion3," Reduced glucose uptake disrupts mitochondrial metabolism and reduces cellular levels of acetyl-CoA. Reduced acetyl-CoA inhibits the acetylation of A20 which promotes its lysosomal degradation. Reduced levels of A20 sensitizes to the activation of RIPK1-dependent cell death and inflammation which can be inhibited by Nec-1s and also by ketogenic diet which provides alternate source of acetyl-CoA to restore cellular levels of A20.  Dysregulation of ubiquitination has been implicated in mediating neurodegeneration57. A20 is an important ubiquitin editing enzyme implicated in multiple human inflammatory diseases25, 26. Cell lineage-specific deficiency of A20 in mice recapitulates several human inflammatory diseases involving RIPK126. Here we show that metabolic dysfunction in Nek1 deficient cells reduces the levels of A20 to promote the activation of RIPK1, necroptosis of CD31+ endothelial cells, and BBB damage, which is critical for the postnatal lethality of Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J mice.",d50d2f8d-ba70-4c43-b7ef-9a0c2f563c48
78,discussion4," Our study reveals the mechanism by which dysfunction in metabolism may promote the activation of RIPK1: unlike amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated genetic variants of OPTN and TBK1, which directly promote the activation of RIPK158, 59, NEK1 can indirectly modulate the activation of RIPK1 through regulating retromer trafficking and metabolism which in turn controls the levels of A20 by regulating the levels of acetyl-CoA. Consistently, ketogenic diet, which may provide alternate source of acetyl-CoA, can also suppress the activation of RIPK1, neuroinflammation and early lethality in Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J mice. Thus, the activation of RIPK1 in Nek1 deficient cells is a downstream consequence of metabolic dysfunction caused by defects in retromer. Consistently, inhibition of RIPK1 has no effect on the other cellular defects caused by retromer dysfunction including lysosome which is known to be regulated by retromer60.",9540b7e0-efd5-4fbb-8780-8f6b6ae74634
79,discussion5," Our results suggest that the metabolic defects in cerebral endothelial cells in different disease conditions might sensitize to the activation of RIPK1 due to reduction in the levels of A20.  Our study highlights the role of RIPK1 and necroptosis of cerebrovascular endothelial cells in mediating central nervous system (CNS) pathology. We have shown that the necroptosis of cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells is involved in mediating BBB damage in Alzheimer’s disease and ischemic stroke51, 61. Here we show the role of RIPK1-mediated necroptosis and apoptosis of cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells in BBB damage due to NEK1 deficiency. Necroptosis and RIPK1-mediated inflammation has been implicated in mediating neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) associated with specific mutations in TNFR1 pathway including OPTN and TBK158, 59, 62–65.",319a8a59-9763-49fe-b40f-b0576102ec25
80,discussion6," Our study suggests that inhibition of RIPK1 may reduce neuroinflammation and the accumulation of misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases that are not genetically connected with mutations in the genes that directly regulate the activation of RIPK1. Inhibition of RIPK1 not only genetically rescued the postnatal lethality of Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J mice by inhibiting BBB damage, but also reduced neuroinflammation and the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as α-synuclein, suggesting that the activation of RIPK1-mediated inflammation might also contribute to the disruption of cellular homeostasis which in turn promotes the accumulation of α-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s diseases and the cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease66–68.  The therapeutic value of a ketogenesis such as by following a Mediterranean diet has been investigated as a metabolic supplement for neurodegenerative diseases69.",3f8c1c8d-32a6-4c82-b80f-827461531785
81,discussion7," Impairment of glucose uptake and defective glycolysis has been noted in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)70. Our study highlights the role of acetyl-CoA as a metabolic regulator of RIPK1. Acetyl-CoA is mainly produced by the breakdown of carbohydrates through glycolysis and lipids through β-oxidation. In low glucose uptake, the origin of Acetyl-CoA heavily relies on lipid β-oxidation, which could be facilitated by ketogenic diet. Other origins of Acetyl-CoA such as from acetate and amino acids might also contribute. Altered fuels, such as ketogenic diet with increased components of C4 ketones, the addition of ketogenic medium-chain triglyceride trioctanoin, the triglyceride of octanoate (caprylic acid), have been suggested as a metabolic supplement for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Ketogenic diet has been shown to increase motor function and survival in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (SOD1G93A)71.",66d824fb-c822-4b13-91dd-69bf5e7c44f1
82,discussion8," Our study supports the use of ketogenic diet in a sub-population of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with metabolic defects to provide additional acety-CoA which may indirectly suppress the activation of RIPK1 by regulating the levels of A20 to reduce neuroinflammation and accumulation of misfolded proteins.  Our study highlights the role of the retromer in regulating homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS) and reveals how retromer dysfunction may mediate neurodegeneration. We show that metabolic defects in Nek1Kat2J mice promote α-synuclein aggregation, a hallmark of PD, which can be ameoriated by inhibition of RIPK1. Genetic variants of retromer components have been associated with AD and PD such as VPS35 genetic variants72. A gene expression profiling study has found that VPS26 is downregulated in AD and implicated in promoting Aβ production73. Variants of the VPS35 gene (also known as PARK17) have been recognized as a cause of late-onset familial PD74.",146439f1-1923-439e-a18f-fd1c15bbeade
83,discussion9," Defects in retromer-mediated endosomal trafficking promote lysosomal dysfunction and disrupt mitochondrial homeostasis50. Thus, defective retromer-mediated endosomal trafficking may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD and PD, but also amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as shown in this study. Although it remains unclear how genetic variants of retromer components may promote the onset of distinct pathology in different neurodegenerative diseases, our study suggests that the regulation of different subtypes of retromer complexes, such as the phosphorylation of VSP26B by NEK1, and the control of subpopulations of retromer substrate trafficking may contribute to the specificity of neuropathology.",abbebc1f-6573-4485-94fe-2fbcd26e0a0d
84,discussion10," Overall, our study suggests the possibility of inhibiting RIPK1 kinase for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), AD, and also PD, to prevent cell death resulting downstream of myriad etiologies of neurodegeneration, but also suggests that metabolic regulations may provide additional benefit for therapeutic intervention.
