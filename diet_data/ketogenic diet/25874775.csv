0,introduction0,"Mitochondrial diseases are the most common group of inherited metabolic disorders, affecting approximately 1:5000 people (Thorburn 2004). They are unusually heterogeneous diseases, both phenotypically and genetically, and can present at virtually any age and with any symptom or combination of symptoms. To date >200 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear-encoded genes have been linked to mitochondrial disorders (Rahman 2013). Leigh syndrome, also known as subacute necrotising encephalomyelopathy, is the most severe form of mitochondrial disease. Patients usually present in late infancy or early childhood, with progressive neurological abnormalities. Symptoms include respiratory abnormalities, nystagmus, ataxia, dystonia and hypotonia (Fassone and Rahman 2012; Leigh 1951).",acf3700c-05c6-49df-ab9a-96334d96ae5b
1,introduction1," Diagnosis of Leigh syndrome requires the presence of characteristic clinical features, increased lactate in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid, and the appearance of characteristic bilateral symmetrical hyperintensities in the basal ganglia and/or brainstem in T2-weighted magnetic resonance image sequences (Fassone and Rahman 2012; Rahman et al 1996). Leigh syndrome is itself genetically heterogeneous, with causative mutations found in genes encoded by the mtDNA, 14 nuclear-encoded subunits of complex I (Fassone and Rahman 2012), and numerous other genes (Lake et al 2015). Despite many advances made in understanding the molecular causes of mitochondrial diseases, treatment options are still very limited and mainly rely on alleviation of symptoms (Kanabus et al 2014).  The ketogenic diet (KD), a high fat, low carbohydrate diet used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy for decades, has been investigated previously as a potential treatment for patients with mitochondrial diseases.",486ef7e2-2129-4cf1-a655-642e3efb87c4
2,introduction2," In cybrid cell lines containing mtDNA deletions, the KD was shown to induce a heteroplasmy shift in favour of wild-type mtDNA (Santra et al 2004). Studies in animal models also showed that the KD can trigger various beneficial cellular changes. Increased mitochondrial respiration, decrease of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), upregulation of expression of uncoupling proteins (Sullivan et al 2004), and increase of glutathione and lipoic acid levels (Jarrett et al 2008) were observed in mice fed with the KD. In the Deletor mouse (a mouse model for mitochondrial diseases, with mutations in the Twinkle helicase which results in multiple mtDNA deletions) a decrease in COX-negative fibres, improved mitochondrial ultrastructure and increased mitochondrial biogenesis were also observed (Ahola-Erkkila et al 2010).",62db2855-1a1f-4e33-923a-1a5fc0ae23a7
3,introduction3," The few clinical reports of the use of KD or high fat diet in complex I deficiency noted improvement in seizures (Kang et al 2006; Seo et al 2010; Yoon et al 2014), and transient improvement of oculomotor palsy in one patient with early-onset Leigh-like syndrome due to NDUFV1 mutations (Laugel et al 2007). However, long-term follow up and treatment of larger cohorts has not been reported, and formal clinical trials are required to provide evidence of efficacy (Rahman 2012).  The KD mechanism of action remains poorly understood, despite its use in clinical settings for decades. Proposed mechanisms include alterations in mitochondrial antioxidant status (Jarrett et al 2008), modulation of neurotransmitter levels (e.g. gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA) (Yudkoff et al 2004) and changes to cellular energy metabolism accompanied by mitochondrial biogenesis (Bough et al 2006). The medium-chain triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) diet is a variation of the classic KD.",e9797d69-4fd0-450f-add8-bd94b7a3d122
4,introduction4," It is as effective in treating seizures as the classic KD, which mostly consists of long-chain fats. In the classic KD approximately 80 % of total caloric intake is fat derived, whereas in the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet this proportion can be reduced to 60 % (Neal et al 2009), and it predominantly contains octanoic acid and decanoic acid, which are also observed in increased levels in the plasma of individuals on this diet (Haidukewych et al 1982).  Recently decanoic acid (C10) was reported to be a ligand for the nuclear receptor PPAR-γ which is known to be involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (Malapaka et al 2012). Furthermore C10 has been shown to induce mitochondrial biogenesis and increase complex I and catalase activity in a neuronal cell line (Hughes et al 2014).",0b3ba4af-6983-40f6-9ce8-ed916cc2aeaf

We show that the two control fibroblast cultures and six fibroblast cell cultures from six research participants with complex I deficiency (Fig. 1a) respond differently to a 6 day exposure to C10. Control cell cultures both showed a significant increase in CS activity, as did cells from three of the six research subjects following C10 treatment (Fig. 1b).

31,results12," Subject 1 cells showed a significant increase in relative expression levels of HMOX1, while no change was observed in expression of TXNIP. In contrast, cells from subject 6 showed no change in HMOX1 expression levels, while TXNIP was significantly decreased upon a 6 day treatment with C10. ACADVL and CAT expression was increased in cells from both subjects 1 and 6 after treatment with C10 (Fig. S4).  Discussion and conclusions Mitochondrial diseases, despite being the most common group of inherited metabolic disease, are in the majority of cases untreatable and often fatal diseases. Huge scientific efforts are currently being directed towards developing new treatment approaches. However, due to the large genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of these disorders, validation of new treatments through proper clinical trials is proving to be extremely challenging (Pfeffer et al 2012; Kanabus et al 2014).",cc3e8916-92f9-4734-a632-896a46ae6d65
32,results13," Several treatment approaches under consideration aim to increase mitochondrial biogenesis, for example Bezafibrate (Yatsuga and Suomalainen 2012) and 5-amino-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR) (Golubitzky et al 2011). Recently our group proposed another alternative, C10, as a potential activator of mitochondrial biogenesis (Hughes et al 2014). It is known that C10, a medium chain fatty acid, is a PPAR-γ ligand (Malapaka et al 2012). Our previous work demonstrated that in a neuronal cell model (SHSY-5Y cells), C10 increased the activities of CS, complex I and catalase (Hughes et al 2014). In view of these findings, in this study we investigated whether C10 could have similar beneficial effects in fibroblast cells obtained from subjects with genetically confirmed primary mitochondrial diseases.  The enzyme CS is widely used as a biomarker for mitochondrial enrichment.",3b8ace09-fe07-4c96-aac7-8ae3e7ef5492
33,results14," It has been shown that CS activity has a strong relationship with mitochondrial fractional area (Larsen et al 2012). We observed an increase in CS activity in the majority of fibroblasts upon incubation with 250 μM C10 for 6 days. Since CS enzyme is a marker for mitochondrial enrichment, we examined overall mitochondrial volume using MitoTracker Green FM staining. We found no significant changes in all but one cell line — subject 3. This suggests that the increase in CS activity may not necessarily be caused by an increase in cellular mitochondrial volume. Furthermore, microarray and qPCR results also did not show an increase in expression levels of CS, but a transient change in expression levels may have occurred prior to day 6.  C10 has previously been shown to be a partial activator of the PPAR-γ receptor (Malapaka et al 2012).",e23a4516-b348-489b-922c-eae8f0a6ce9b
34,results15," More potent PPAR-γ activators such as members of the thiazolidinedione drug family (including rosiglitazone) may trigger serious side effects including adipogenesis, stroke and myocardial infarction (Spiegelman 1998; Graham et al. 2010). C10 is a component of the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet, which is not associated with such adverse effects. Additionally, it has been shown that C10 does not increase glucose sensitivity, and improves the overall lipid profile without having an effect on weight in diabetic mice (Malapaka et al 2012). In order to confirm that the increase in CS enzyme activity observed in cells supplemented with C10 is a downstream effect of PPAR-γ activation, we also measured CS activity in the presence of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), a PPAR-γ receptor antagonist (Fig. 1c and d).",a2581d29-5390-49b5-8d19-9297ee8866f8
35,results16," We found that incubating control fibroblasts in the presence of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) reduced CS activity levels significantly, while incubating these cells with bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) + C10 restored CS activity levels to control values. These data confirm that the observed increase in CS activity occurs as a result of a PPAR-γ mediated pathway, at least in control cells. However, the observation of an attenuated response to bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) in one subject raises the possibility of altered PPAR-γ mediated signalling in some cases of complex I deficiency.  It has been previously suggested that an increased mitochondrial content may be associated with reduced respiratory chain enzyme activities (Bernier et al 2002). Since we were investigating the effects of C10 on cells obtained from complex I deficient individuals, we measured complex I to ensure that C10 does not have a detrimental effect on these cells.",ec6c8c77-4fff-4019-a62e-901efce08e82
36,results17," Reassuringly, our results showed that C10 did not exacerbate the complex I deficiency. Moreover, in control 2 cells, complex I activity was increased. Our previous study performed on SHSY-5Y cells also found an increase in complex I activity after treatment with C10 (Hughes et al 2014). Complex I is reported to be rate limiting for ATP formation in neuronal cells but this may not be the case for other cell types such as fibroblasts (Davey et al. 1998). Furthermore, the glycolytic nature of fibroblasts plus the genotype/phenotype of the affected subjects’ cells studied may be contributing factors to the differences seen in this study when compared to those previously performed on a relatively homogeneous cell line.  C10 has a similar chemical structure to the anticonvulsant valproic acid, which has also been linked to increased mitochondrial biogenesis (Hayasaka et al. 1986), and which has been shown to reduce mitochondrial complex IV activity (Ponchaut et al. 1995).",0ba840ca-2124-4292-b34c-4e5ab65e44fc
37,results18," It was therefore important also to measure complex IV activity following treatment of the control and subject fibroblasts with C10. We observed a decrease in complex IV activity only in one out of eight fibroblast cultures, suggesting that C10 does not share valproate’s toxic effects on mitochondrial respiratory chain function.  We further evaluated the effects of C10 on reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and mitochondrial membrane potential. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are thought to be one of the main pathogenic mechanisms underlying mitochondrial disorders, especially in patients with complex I deficiencies, since complex I is a major site of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Any compound which increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels could potentially cause further damage to the respiratory chain (Heales et al. 1996; Marí et al. 2009).",63bf1ec3-b705-4a35-9bef-29499378e361
38,results19," We found that in all subject cells, except for subject 3, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were unchanged following C10 treatment. Subject 3 cells also showed an increase in overall mitochondrial volume, which might explain the observed increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Indeed, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels per unit of mitochondrial volume were unchanged. Additionally, our qPCR experiments revealed increased CAT expression levels in all three cell lines studied, including the one which did not show an increase in CS activity (i.e. cells from subject 1). These data are consistent with our previous observation that C10 treatment increased catalase enzyme activity in SHSY-5Y cells (Hughes et al 2014) and led us to suspect that C10 may increase cellular resistance to oxidative stress.",010bafb1-a838-444f-a8d1-ac5ce31a40cc
39,results20," This hypothesis was confirmed by the fact that cells treated with C10 and exposed to rotenone had lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels than cells not treated with C10 but exposed to the same concentration of rotenone. However, this observation may also indicate an improvement of mitochondrial function as we have previously reported that reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is more sensitive than ATP as an indicator of changes in mitochondrial function (Jacobson et al 2005). We also examined mitochondrial membrane potential pre- and post-C10 treatment. Increased mitochondrial membrane potential would be suggestive of better proton pumping functions of the respiratory chain complexes and increased ATP production.",df56fb01-d05d-4124-8c28-bef0b2ccefbc
40,results21," It is important to note, however, that increased mitochondrial membrane potential may result in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and vice versa, high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels can lead to the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Korshunov et al. 1997). Furthermore, under certain conditions mitochondrial membrane potential may be maintained at the expense of ATP production, by reversal of the activity of the ATP synthase (Duberley et al. 2013). Similarly to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) results, we observed no changes in mitochondrial membrane potential in cells from both controls and all studied subjects, except fibroblasts from subject 3, in which we also observed increased mitochondrial volume, as discussed above.",dd573a14-c48b-49eb-a33a-aa75ca450aba
41,results22,"  Our microarray data also suggest that supplementation of cell culture medium with C10 in the presence of high glucose concentration upregulates genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, whilst downregulating expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism (Table 2, Fig. 4). Upregulation of genes such as LDLR, CPT1A and ACADVL suggests that lipid metabolism pathways are overall upregulated without discriminating the length of the fatty acid chain. This may find its applications in a wider range of diseases, such as hyperlipidaemia or obesity. Additionally, we also observed an increase in expression of the ATP5O subunit of ATP synthase, alongside a decrease in expression of NDUFC1, encoding a supernumerary subunit of complex I, the precise function of which remains unknown. This may reflect the fact that fatty acid metabolism bypasses complex I in the respiratory chain.",5171c6bc-5b98-4bc6-affd-2ea22779832c
42,results23," The genes involved in glucose metabolism which were downregulated include PCK2 which encodes the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis. Additionally, we also observed an increase in expression levels of PDK4 and PDK3, which encode the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, an enzyme which inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase — an essential link between glycolysis and the TCA cycle (Fig. 4). Finally, the observation that expression of genes associated with gluconeogenesis was decreased, whilst that of genes associated with fatty acid oxidation was increased, suggests the possibility that stress signalling may be at play, possibly mediated by AMPK (Hardie et al 2015). This would be an interesting avenue for further investigations.",cefd13bd-3953-4ac8-b346-9f6761a6a85f
43,results24,"  We conclude that supplementation of fibroblast cells with C10 has pleiotropic effects on mitochondrial function through targeting the PPAR-γ receptor, and thus potentially increasing mitochondrial biogenesis as well as increasing cellular resistance to oxidative stress. Based on these preliminary findings, we suggest that this therapy should now be further investigated in mouse models of mitochondrial disease. Our results also highlight the importance of genetically and phenotypically matched cohorts when studying treatments for mitochondrial diseases, and suggest that not every mitochondrial patient will benefit from the same type of treatment. Furthermore, the assay methods described here could be utilised to identify suitable patients for further investigation of the efficacy of C10 therapy in a clinical trial, in a ‘personalised medicine’ approach.",9f23feb3-c8af-467d-bd66-80423c6de676
