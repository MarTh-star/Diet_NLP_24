0,background0,"Migraine is a complex, common and debilitating neurological disorder [1] that affects approximately 17% of women and 8% of men in Europe [2]. With a peak incidence during the most productive years of life, migraine not only causes a huge amount of suffering, but also inflicts a substantial amount of costs on society: approximately €18.5 billion per year in Europe alone [3].  Various lines of research suggest that brain energy metabolism abnormalities are likely to be part of migraine pathophysiology [4–9]. Specifically, there is some evidence for reversible abnormalities in mitochondrial functioning in migraine [7, 8, 10]. For example, treatment with riboflavin and coenzyme Q10 has been shown to have migraine-protective effects [4, 7, 9–12], probably via a positive effect on energy metabolism [7, 10].",6c2a18ba-ba94-487c-8b4a-0f6b0913c2a1
1,background1," Lactic and pyruvic acid, markers of mitochondrial disease, have been found to be increased in migraineurs [13]; 31P-MRS patterns seen in migraine are consistent with what is seen in mitochondrial disorders [5, 14–16]; and COX-negative fibres typical of mitochondrial diseases have also been seen in some patients with migraine [6]. A breakdown of the resting membrane potential due to lack of ATP could explain cortical abnormalities in excitability, which have been reported in migraine [17–21] and would offer a mechanism by which the trigeminal pain pathway, whose afferents densely innervate the meninges and its associated blood vessels, could be activated or sensitised in migraine. The activation and sensitisation of the trigeminal pain pathway is considered the current understanding for the origin of the migraine headache [22–24].",8eafa574-6c86-4ffd-9f83-3ec6c6a757c1
2,background2,"  Despite causing a huge amount of suffering and a substantial amount of costs for society [3, 25], current migraine treatment options are limited and their mechanisms of action are also not completely understood [26]. Most of the prophylactic agents licensed to date are not migraine specific and are additionally associated with significant, sometimes intolerable, side-effects. Furthermore, their migraine-preventive properties tend to be moderate at most. Hence, there is a need for developing alternative anti-migraine therapies.  The ketogenic diet (KD) was developed about 100 years ago after the observation that prolonged fasting has anticonvulsive properties [27]. With its high fat, low carbohydrate and medium protein content, the KD simulates the metabolic effects of starvation. With the advent of antiepileptic medication the rather complicated KD fell out of favour.",39420901-a586-418f-bc65-d7cea94582e5
3,background3," However, within recent years it has received new interest, in particular since ketone bodies (KBs) might be beneficial for a variety of neurological and even psychiatric disorders due to various different mechanisms [28–30], including improved energy metabolism.  Recently, some case studies [31–34] and a first short proof-of-concept study [35] have demonstrated a reduction in migraine attack frequency, severity and use of acute anti-migraine medication during ketosis—with effect sizes ranging from total absence of attacks [31] to a reduction to 1/5th of the run-in period [35]. In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that the migraine-protective effect may outlast the duration of ketosis [31, 32, 35]. This might be a result of longer-lasting gene expression changes [28, 36]. Elevated KB levels in humans have been shown to be well tolerated for extended periods of time (up to several years) [34, 37–48].",ad354918-4896-4bf2-9a2e-31b744901b79
4,background4," However, a strict KD might not provide a feasible long-term solution for all episodic migraine patients, because patient adherence may be limited and it is not easily implemented in an ambulatory setting.  An alternative means to induce a state of mild to medium nutritional ketosis (0.4–2 mmol/l), irrespective of blood glucose levels, is dietary supplementation with ketogenic substances, such as beta-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) salts [45, 49–52]. This approach could be easily implemented with intake of a ketogenic powder dissolved in water (consisting of a calcium–magnesium–βHB salt three times a day). This intervention seems much more feasible than a strict KD in larger patient populations and avoids the complications of a very restricted high-fat diet. These considerations led us to examine the efficacy and safety of KB mineral salts in migraine prevention within the scopes of a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety trial with a crossover design.",c25633b1-3404-416e-a278-94ade451a98e

As the study medicament has a half-life of less than 4 h and the outcome measures are based on the last 4 weeks of the 12 weeks intervention only, a 4-week wash-out period was judged to be sufficient. This will be followed by a second 12-week intervention period of the alternative treatment (patients who first received placebo will now receive investigational medicinal product (IMP) and vice versa).

Also known as beta-hydroxybutyric acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid or 3-hydroxybutyrate, βHB is an endogenous metabolite with the formula CH3CH(OH)CH2CO2H. It is a beta-hydroxy acid and a keto acid. The investigational medicinal product (IMP) was purchased from Ergomax (https://www.ergomaxsupplements.com) in bulk powder of GMP quality and packaged at Hänseler AG (Herisau, Switzerland).

This adds up to less than 100 kcal per day. Each serving will raise KB levels for approximately 3 h. To minimise possible gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating or diarrhoea, patients are instructed to increase the dosage over time, starting with half the dose during the first week before reaching the maximum dosage by day 7.  Elevated ketone body (KB) levels have been shown to be well tolerated for extended periods of time (up to several years) [31–35, 37–49].

The rather conservative dose of 18 g βHB mineral salt per day (as compared to endogenous production during starvation) was determined largely by the mineral load of Mg2+ and Ca2+, which we wanted to keep within acceptable ranges. Not going over the suggested maximum supplemental guidelines meant 9 g of Mg-βHB and 9 g of Ca-βHB, respectively. A similar dose of 5 g βHB/day was shown to lead to a modest elevation in blood KB (up to 0.4 mmol/l) [52], supporting the safety of our chosen dose.

A day with head pain will only be classified as a migraine day if it meets ICHD-3 classification criteria. According to the International Headache Association and the European Medical Association Guidelines, the recommended measure to assess migraine frequency reduction is the change in migraine days per 4 weeks compared to baseline.

A crossover design in migraine is typically not recommended [68] because of the following limitations [67]: the possibility of a carry-over effect; the need for a long total period of treatment (extended by a wash-out period) with concomitant increases in drop-outs over time and in turn loss of statistical power [70]; and the increased likelihood of adverse events, which can unmask the blinding when a subject is exposed to both treatments.",097b6219-641a-4951-9e6c-0446ff0e1ee2
72,discussion4,"  In our case, a crossover design has three key advantages:A crossover design greatly improves statistical power, as each patient can be his/her own control (within-subject analysis versus between-subject analysis), which can be especially useful in a heterogeneous disease such as migraine, and hence fewer patients would be necessary to demonstrate a given effect. The sample size is effectively halved, even when more conservative a priori assumptions are employed, which is advantageous in single-centre studies. To compensate for some of the aforementioned weaknesses of crossover designs in migraine, we decided to make our a priori assumptions to determine the sample size more conservative than we would have with a parallel group design: a statistical power of 90% and a drop-out rate of 30% were chosen (in addition to a 30% placebo effect).",1a57103b-f077-4e76-937a-88d213810a90
73,discussion5,"  A crossover design gives each patient the chance to try the investigational medicinal product (IMP), which—from our experience—increases compliance, motivation and participation rates. We asked 25 prospective subjects for their preference and all of them favoured a crossover over a parallel group design. Instead of 6 months including a follow-up period, patients are now participating for a total of 9 months. The longer duration might lead to a slight increase in drop-out rates; however, on the other hand, it also leads to much improved participation rates, while only needing half of the patients. Additionally, it is known that vigilant patient education, monitoring and follow-up may reduce drop-out rates in longer trails [70]. From our experience, the moderate increase in trial duration has nowhere near negatively outweighed the positive impact of being guaranteed exposure to the investigational medicinal product (IMP).",01753b2b-58b0-4162-a8a9-43b1cbec7c7f
74,discussion6," A subsequent open-label period at the termination of the parallel group design would have a similar effect, but would also increase the costs substantially, as it does not have any impact on statistical power. This can be problematic, particularly for investigator-initiated trials.  In addition to adding a wash-out period, the crossover design also allowed us to incorporate a second baseline period. This might help control for any potential seasonal effects on migraine frequency.    The possibility of a carry-over effect is always there; however, with a very short half-life of approximately 3–4 h, a 4-week wash-out period was judged to be sufficient.  Finally, we addressed the possibility of unblinding due to exposure to both substances.",0dc51c20-cc85-4c39-a944-61f7c7319c28
75,discussion7," While there is no way to completely avoid this issue, we chose a placebo with a similar gastrointestinal side-effect profile to the investigational medicinal product (IMP): mannitol, a sugar alcohol, can cause gastrointestinal disturbances, without having any systemic effect as it does not leave the gastrointestinal tract [58].  Various explorative outcomes have been included in order to be able to identify some of the potential protective mechanisms of exogenously induced ketosis in migraine. In addition, we are hoping this might help us distinguish responders and non-responders on both a phenotypical as well as physiological level.  Trial status The trial started enrolment in May 2017 and is expected to be completed by the end of January 2020.  The newest protocol version is V6 of 5 September 2018. All protocol modifications have been and will be reported to the local ethic committee (Swissethics) and other relevant parties (such as Swissmedics, investigators and trial participants).",ce1acf88-82d6-43ea-9004-0887cb42b09c
