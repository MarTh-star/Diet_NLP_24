0,background0,"The dietary macronutrient that raises postprandial serum glucose and insulin most potently is carbohydrate [1]. This observation led to the use of diets low in carbohydrate for the treatment of diabetes before insulin or other medication therapies were available [2]. In like fashion, individuals who are insulin-deficient are instructed to estimate the amount of carbohydrate in the meal and then to administer the insulin dosage based upon the amount of dietary carbohydrate. This strong relationship between dietary carbohydrate and postprandial serum glucose led to the development of medications that block carbohydrate absorption for the treatment of type 2 diabetes [3].  Clinical studies that have lowered the percentage of dietary carbohydrate and/or the glycemic index of the carbohydrate have consistently shown improvements in glycemic control among individuals with type 2 diabetes [4-8].",5af29acd-3db6-4f74-9681-86d6cb09c9bd
1,background1," In randomized studies, low-carbohydrate diets have been found effective for the treatment of obesity for durations up to 24 months [9]. While glycemic control was not a primary outcome, some of these studies additionally demonstrated improvement in glycemic parameters when carbohydrate intake was lowered. In the Nurse's Health Study cohort study, low-glycemic load diets were found to be associated with lower cardiac risk over a 20 year period [10]. One mechanism to explain these findings is that when patients are instructed to limit carbohydrate intake to low levels without mention of caloric intake, there is an overall reduction in caloric intake [11].  In several recent studies, in the outpatient setting and metabolic ward, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets led to improvements in glycemic control among patients with diabetes [12-16].",73342d62-ed7e-4448-93c5-b390166d640a

In the present study, our hypothesis was that a diet lower in carbohydrate would lead to greater improvement in glycemic control in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus over 24 weeks in the outpatient setting.

The diet containing fewer carbohydrates, the Low carbohydrate Ketogenic Diet Group Intervention (LCKD), was most effective for improving glycemic control. In patients taking insulin, the effects were often quite powerful. For example, participants taking from 40 to 90 units of insulin before the study were able to eliminate their insulin use, while also improving glycemic control. Because this effect occurs immediately upon implementing the dietary changes, individuals with type 2 diabetes who are unable to adjust their own medication or self-monitor their blood glucose should not make these dietary changes unless under close medical supervision.",55b3913b-71b7-4921-a002-c467348d9407
24,discussion1,"  A low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet combines two approaches that, on their own, improve blood glucose control: weight loss and a reduced-glycemic index diet. Weight loss via dietary modification has a beneficial effect on diabetes [27,28]. A reduced-glycemic index diet without weight loss can also lead to improvement in diabetic control, with the magnitude of effect of a 0.43% reduction in hemoglobin A1c, when compared with higher-glycemic diets of similar carbohydrate content [4]. The greater effect of the low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet in this study appeared to be due to the lower carbohydrate intake, because statistical significance remained after adjustment for weight loss. Because ""low-glycemic"" diets in previous studies typically contain from 40–60% of calories from carbohydrate, it is possible that the beneficial effect of ""low-glycemic"" diets could be augmented by further reduction of the absolute amount of carbohydrate, or by a reduction in caloric content.",3bb56181-6c73-47b8-ad3d-6878fce44863
25,discussion2,"  While this study was a treatment trial of individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle modification has been shown to prevent type 2 diabetes in the Diabetes Prevention Program (Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)).

While the effect was stronger than medication, the intensive lifestyle group developed diabetes at a rate of 20% after 4 years. Future research should include the use of lower-carbohydrate diets for the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes.  Like previous studies, we found that the Low carbohydrate Ketogenic Diet Group Intervention (LCKD) led to weight reduction, improvement in glycemic control, and elevation in HDL-cholesterol, but no deterioration in fasting lipid parameters.",ed52f537-8f82-4261-8489-1b1b24eafd0b

It is interesting to note that the Low glycemic index diet group intervention (LGID) group reported consuming fewer calories than the Low carbohydrate Ketogenic Diet Group Intervention (LCKD) group, yet had less weight loss. This may reflect problems with the diet data as collected, issues with differential physical activity, or metabolic inefficiency (leading to increased energy expenditure) which may occur during the consumption of a carbohydrate-restricted diet.  Limitations of this study include the lack of blinding of physicians and outcome assessors to treatment group, and the use of food records.

The last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis might generalize better to a population of patients who have different food preferences from their assigned diet, who lose/lack motivation, or who experience other barriers to dietary change. Another possible limitation is the baseline imbalance in the primary outcome, HgA1c, which occurred despite random allocation. The equation used to calculate energy requirements for the Low glycemic index diet group intervention (LGID) participants may underestimate requirements, particularly in obese people.",23ecb7e2-2c6d-4d7d-88c7-b1ecd4cb7380
28,discussion5," This would result in more severe energy restriction than the 500 kcal deficit as stated, which might bias the weight loss effects in favor of the Low glycemic index diet group intervention (LGID).  It is often presumed that obesity is the cause of type 2 diabetes, but there are clearly instances where obesity occurs without type 2 diabetes, and instances where type 2 diabetes occurs without obesity. In this study, the change in hemoglobin A1c was independent of the change in weight (Figure 2). This supports the concept that weight change and glycemic control are not serially linked but rather may be the result of the same pathophysiologic process, such as abnormal insulin metabolism.  The underlying principle of carbohydrate-restriction and the historic precedents of using the low-carbohydrate diet for type 2 diabetes suggest that the low-carbohydrate approach may be one of the most effective dietary treatments for diabetes.",bb8169ed-4a85-41d8-b158-d79528c41cf7
29,discussion6," Our findings support this position, and it suggests that the burden of proof be placed upon alternative points of view. The dearth of randomized, controlled trials using the low-carbohydrate approach for type 2 diabetes, despite the historical and current clinical use of these approaches, challenges the idea that the randomized controlled trial should be the only guide of scientific inquiry and clinical practice.  Conclusion In summary, lifestyle modification using two diets that reduce carbohydrate intake led to improvement in glycemic control, diabetic medication elimination/reduction, and weight loss in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes over a 24-week period in the outpatient setting. The diet containing fewer carbohydrates, the low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet, was more effective for improving glycemic control than the low glycemic diet.",7831e029-133b-426a-97b3-2b19dabad877
