0,background0," Individuals with allergic asthma exhibit lung inflammation and remodeling accompanied by methacholine hyperresponsiveness manifesting in proximal airway narrowing and distal lung tissue collapsibility, and they can present with a range of mild-to-severe disease amenable or resistant to therapeutic intervention, respectively. There remains a need for alternatives or complements to existing treatments that could control the physiologic manifestations of allergic asthma.  Objectives  Our aim was to examine the hypothesis that because ketone bodies elicit anti-inflammatory activity and are effective in mitigating the methacholine hyperresponsiveness associated with obese asthma, increasing systemic concentrations of ketone bodies would diminish pathologic outcomes in asthma-relevant cell types and in mouse models of allergic asthma.

55,discussion0," The increasingly prevalent global asthma epidemic60—especially the epidemic of severe asthma6, 7, 8—has created a pressing need to devise alternative and complementary strategies to limit the impact on patients’ lives imposed by the syndrome. “Therapeutic ketosis” is one such approach that has recently gained attention for its potential to provide benefit in a myriad of disease settings and through a number of mechanisms. As reported herein, our studies demonstrate that the ketone bodies AcAc and BHB inhibit agonist-induced cytokine production from several asthma-relevant cell types, including proinflammatory cytokine production from macrophages and airway epithelial cells, secretion of prototypic cytokines from polyclonally stimulated or restimulated CD4+ T cells, and type 2 cytokines and IFN-γ secretion from house dust mite (HDM) allergen–restimulated lymphocyte cultures.",2bd9b8e0-728a-47c0-8e62-0c7dd5b095da
56,discussion1," The mechanisms whereby these ketones affect a myriad of cell types in vitro remain uncertain, but they may include activation of cell surface receptors, providing energetic substrates for utilization through the Krebs cycle, functioning as antioxidants, modulating intracellular signaling regulating cytokine production and cell contraction, and inhibiting allergen protease activity. Moreover, through these or other mechanisms, dietary treatments that increase systemic concentrations of BHB in vivo, including a ketogenic diet, ketone body precursor feeding, or KE supplementation decrease allergic asthma–associated methacholine hyperresponsiveness, the most relevant pathophysiologic manifestation of preclinical asthma models.  Both large airway and peripheral lung dysfunction are present in allergic asthma,61 and our interventions show that increased BHB concentrations benefit both of these anatomic units.",d42c05e7-320f-4985-ac9e-f97488a10fcd
57,discussion2," In each of the preclinical allergic asthma models presented, ketone bodies decreased the parameter airway resistance, which provides a measure of the flow resistance of the entire airway tree. Ketone body augmentation also decreased tissue damping and tissue elastance, which are increased by the development of heterogeneous ventilation to the distal reaches of the lung owing to variations in airway narrowing, and also by derecruitment of lung units,62 both of which are particularly sensitive to contraction of peripheral airways.63 As the central airways and the lung periphery are not mechanically independent owing to the tethering of parenchymal tissues to the airways,64 we speculate that a mechanism through which ketones restrain airway hyperresponsiveness may involve affecting bronchial smooth muscle cells affected by house dust mite (HDM) challenges, attenuating their capacity to contract in response to methacholine, and thereby affecting the changes in all 3 mechanics parameters.",03eedb59-abc4-4cfe-9267-4c863aa67294
58,discussion3,"  Our studies using human bronchial smooth muscle cells cultured in vitro show that house dust mite (HDM)-induced morphologic change is attenuated in the presence of BHB and is at least partially a consequence of BHB-mediated inhibition of house dust mite (HDM) protease activity. We posit that providing elevated levels of ketone bodies could provide benefit65 to patients with allergic asthma and may do so through a number of direct and indirect effects on lung physiology throughout the proximal airways and distal airspaces that modulate inhaled methacholine hyperresponsiveness. Although our studies reveal 1 mechanism by which ketone bodies may beneficially affect allergic asthma by attenuating house dust mite (HDM)-induced effects on bronchial smooth muscle cells, the anti-inflammatory effects observed in vitro may also be evoked if higher concentrations of BHB are achieved in vivo, perhaps through pharmacologic instead of dietary means.",4afb0885-8636-4d6d-8ad4-f944118179fa
59,discussion4," Indeed, several studies of in vivo anti-inflammatory activities of therapeutic ketosis have been reported, with some directly relevant to lung inflammation.18,34,35 Intriguingly, it has been shown that ketogenic diet inhibits allergic airway inflammation elicited by the protease papain by decreasing type 2 innate lymphoid cell influx, activation, and accompanying cytokine production, although the mechanism described was related to decreased glucose availability rather than to the effects of ketone bodies per se, and methacholine responsiveness was not assessed.66  Elevating ketone bodies is safe both in animal models of disease and in human subjects.22,23,40,67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73 In our studies, feeding a ketogenic diet, adding 1,3-BD to chow, or supplementing with KE augmented circulating BHB levels, but not to remarkably high concentrations and not nearly to those used in our in vitro studies or in those of other investigators.",194e21f0-8451-485a-90e9-5e09b1142ab9
60,discussion5," A ketogenic diet contains sufficient protein, reduced amounts of carbohydrates, and an abundance of fat that serves as a substrate for ketone body formation.74 1,3-BD is an ethanol dimer that is converted by the liver into BHB that can enter the circulation15 and has been incorporated into KEs. KEs are considered a dietary supplement and have shown benefits to elite athletes and in patients with chronic disease.22,23,40,67,68 As used in our studies, the KE (R)-1,3-BHB (R)-1,3-BD23,67,68 augments circulating BHB levels and was incorporated into mouse food at a concentration of 20% of weight (and approximately 20% of calories) to promote protracted consumption. KE supplementation elicited the most consistent and substantial effects to decrease methacholine hyperresponsiveness in each of the mouse models of allergic asthma, which we speculate is a consequence of its capacity to most markedly elevate circulating BHB levels.",db5b2c07-2488-40ac-9d08-89d7dacc3921
61,discussion6," This KE supplementation strategy could be optimized as an approach to promote a state of “therapeutic ketosis” similar to that achieved through the feeding of a ketogenic diet or fasting, without any caloric deficit or the need for substantial lifestyle modification.  BHB has been reported to function as a class I histone deacetylase (histone deacetylase (HDAC)) inhibitor11,12,32 and to induce β-hydroxybutyrylation of histone H3 lysines75,76 to influence gene expression. Histone modifications have been reported in the context of allergic asthma.77,78 β-Hydroxybutyrylation also posttranslationally modifies a multitude of additional cellular proteins with both known effects and heretofore unknown consequences.",8e467bfe-e4db-4933-9eea-f4529d8c75f8
62,discussion7,"79,80 Although we speculated that hydroxybutyrylation of house dust mite (HDM) proteins could account for the ability of BHB to inhibit house dust mite (HDM) protease activity, inconsistencies of available reagents did not enable us to provide compelling evidence to support this hypothesis. As we have previously reported altered levels of expression of the smooth muscle–associated genes transgelin/SM-22 alpha (Tagln) and actin alpha-2/alpha-smooth muscle actin (Acta2) in the lungs of methacholine-hyperresponsive HFD-fed obese mice, which were decreased in obese mice consuming a KE supplement, bronchial smooth muscle cells in vivo may perhaps be targets of BHB-induced posttranslational modifications affecting gene expression or protein functions related to methacholine hyperresponsiveness. The effects of BHB on methacholine-induced intracellular signaling events in bronchial smooth muscle cells merit further investigation.",60ad7b41-f5a7-4b36-90c8-9e8d22b24c82
63,discussion8," Intriguingly, inflammasome activation18,34, 35, 36 and PAD4-regulated netosis81 are both inhibited by BHB, which decreases the regulated secretion of bioactive products, including IL-1β and NETs, respectively. It is possible that in addition to inhibiting bronchial smooth muscle contraction, BHB inhibits mucus secretion from methacholine-stimulated airway goblet cells, which could affect airflow and, therefore, the parameters measured in our flexiVent analysis.  There are several limitations to our findings. Namely, we used in vitro studies, cell lines, and preclinical mouse models instead of human subjects. The allergic asthma models used are not representative of the protracted nature of human asthma, and end points such as fibrotic remodeling were not assessed.",6837fb08-aee6-4839-bd8f-5093d168ad0f
64,discussion9," Furthermore, whereas methacholine hyperresponsiveness is a relevant end point to assess in mice, it is not truly a surrogate for important human asthma–associated symptoms or morbidities such as exacerbation frequency, dyspnea, or impact on quality of life. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of therapeutic ketosis in decreasing the methacholine hyperresponsiveness associated with allergic asthma in several models implicates the potentially broad effectiveness of therapeutic ketosis in several asthma endotypes. Asthma “endotyping” is an approach in which clinical presentation and biomarkers are used to stratify patients and identify targets for disease intervention.",93366b29-4517-40ce-a261-8d3fd6e5c684
65,discussion10,"3,82 We used house dust mite (HDM)-driven preclinical allergic asthma models representative of TH2-dominated, eosinophilic, acute disease that is sensitive to corticosteroid treatment (alum/house dust mite (HDM) and intranasal house dust mite (HDM) sensitization),52,83 a house dust mite (HDM) reexposure model representative of more protracted disease, and a model of mixed granulocytic, steroid-resistant, severe disease.52 Interestingly, in this model of severe allergic asthma, combined treatment with dietary KE and systemic corticosteroid significantly decreased methacholine hyperresponsiveness, particularly airway resistance, but also tissue damping and tissue elastance at the highest doses of methacholine. Add-on biologic therapy and corticosteroid administration is routinely used in the treatment of TH2high asthma,84 and it would likely be used in novel non-TH2 severe asthma therapies as well.",c9fe892d-ba4b-4747-ad88-dee29e7d28c8
66,discussion11," Although it is possibly only one of several approaches that may be useful, perhaps the combined dietary ketone supplementation plus corticosteroid treatment represents an optimal therapeutic strategy. How mice receiving dietary KE supplementation ""reestablish"" corticosteroid responsiveness remains unclear. As is already being tested,85 metabolic therapies for allergic asthma, including “therapeutic ketosis,” could provide potential complements or alternatives to other conventional approaches for the treatment of these patients.
