0,methods0," This is a retrospective analysis of hospitalized adults with serious and persistent mental illness who were provided a KD in lieu of the standard hospital menu. Between May 2019 and April 2020, 31 adults whose chronic psychiatric symptoms were poorly controlled despite intensive psychopharmacological management were admitted to the Clinique du Castelviel and placed on a KD under the supervision of their treating psychiatrist, Dr. Danan. This treatment program was approved by Clinique du Castelviel administration and ethics review.  Participants  Participants were uncompensated volunteers selected by Dr. Danan from his outpatient psychiatric practice. Informed consent was obtained in every case. Eligibility criteria were failure to respond adequately to conventional psychiatric care and willingness to try a KD. Exclusion criteria were anorexia nervosa, BMI below 18.5 kg/m2, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and contraindicated medical conditions (23).",eac666ce-f826-48e8-b4e5-e2474eb58c96
1,methods1," Primary psychiatric diagnoses were bipolar disorder type two (n = 13), schizoaffective disorder (n = 12), and major depressive disorder (n = 7). All participants had at least one indicator of poor metabolic health, such as overweight, obesity, hypertension, and/or elevated fasting blood glucose. Most participants had been in Dr. Danan's care for many years (mean [SD] 10 [7] years, range 5 months to 30 years), and all had been psychiatrically hospitalized in the past under his supervision one or more times either at this same facility or a similar affiliated facility with minimal clinical improvement. None of the participants had ever attempted to follow a low-carbohydrate diet before.  Of 31 patients, 22 were voluntarily admitted for the express purpose of initiating the KD in a monitored setting. The remaining 9 were initially admitted for conventional care but later agreed to the KD because non-dietary interventions proved ineffective.",e0ec8acc-913e-4f04-bf20-8e16b6e6944f
2,methods2," All 31 were taking psychotropic medication at the time of KD initiation.  In addition to the KD protocol, which was the cornerstone of their treatment plan, participants also received the usual care available to all patients admitted to this unit. Hospital staff was comprised of 8 psychiatrists, 3 psychologists, 2 general medical practitioners, 2 social workers, an occupational therapist, an exercise instructor, and a dietitian. Illnesses typically treated at this facility included mood disorders, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, and eating disorders. Participants resided on the inpatient unit 6 days per week but were free to leave the hospital on weekends for up to 36 consecutive hours.  Statistical Analysis  Means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables; frequency distributions were calculated for nominal and ordinal variables.",2e1334b9-f8ed-4362-b869-fca5c27f1ce5
3,methods3," We used paired t-tests when the pre-post differences had a normal distribution and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests when the differences were skewed, using SPSS 28.0.1.1.  Interventions  The KD protocol employed was adapted from that used by Dr. Westman in clinical trials at Duke University (24); see Supplementary Figure 1: Ketogenic Diet Protocol for details and a sample meal plan. Briefly, carbohydrate intake was restricted to a maximum of 20 total grams per day (approximately 5% of daily calories), exclusively from vegetables, nuts, lemon juice, and small amounts of dark chocolate. Protein comprised 15–20% of daily calories and was sourced from meat, seafood, poultry, dairy products, eggs, and nuts. Fat comprised 75–80% of the diet; added fats permitted were olive oil, coconut oil, butter, mayonnaise, and sour cream.",49e0270f-3e7f-42ae-881c-1ccfd85c309f

Participants also received once-daily supplementation of fish oil (250 mg: 18% EPA, 12% DHA), magnesium oxide (300 mg), copper (1 mg), vitamin B1 (1.1 mg), vitamin B5 (6 mg), vitamin B6 (3.4 mg), vitamin B12 (2.5 mg), and vitamin C (330 mg).  Dr. Danan met individually with each participant 6 days per week to monitor clinical progress and provide dietary education and support.

Urine acetoacetate was measured at least once per participant during the intervention period. Metabolic monitoring including blood tests, blood pressure, and body weight was conducted on day 0 of the KD and again on the final day of the KD, just prior to hospital discharge.  Admission date, hospitalization length, KD duration, and non-dietary aspects of care varied depending on clinical circumstances.

18,discussion0," This iteration of a KD was safe, feasible to administer in an inpatient setting, well tolerated by most patients, and associated with substantial and statistically significant improvements in symptoms of depression and psychosis not observed during previous hospitalizations. Effect sizes were large (Cohen's d > 0.8) (36) across all mental health outcome measures in all subgroups, and were very large among those with a primary diagnosis of major depression. Given that the interventions implemented during this hospitalization differed only in the addition of the KD to usual care, we believe it is likely that the KD contributed considerably to these unprecedented mental health improvements, particularly in the 79% of patients whose psychotropic medications were either reduced or unchanged.",14dfa8b2-405f-4d18-8e5d-f75d2d6e6e6e
19,discussion1," The notable improvements in multiple markers of metabolic health including body weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, and triglycerides observed in this series would be difficult to ascribe to any aspect of the hospitalization other than the KD, which is known to facilitate these healthy changes (37).  Historical and Scientific Context  A recent non-randomized study of 262 outpatients with type 2 diabetes treated with a KD detected significant improvement in mood. This cohort included 36 patients with mild clinical depression, more than half of whom no longer met criteria for depression at week 10 (38).  To the best of our knowledge, this case series represents the first exploration of the use of the KD in hospitalized patients with bipolar illness or severe depressive illness, and only the second exploration of the use of the KD in hospitalized patients with psychotic illness—the first having been published in 1965 (39).",ba53cf59-fc9f-47e5-8688-b15ac31bd4e9
20,discussion2," In that pilot study, a KD was administered to 10 women with treatment-refractory schizophrenia, resulting in statistically significant improvements in mean symptom scores after 2 weeks. Since that time, a number of isolated case reports describing people with mental illness who have benefited substantially from KDs have been documented; the first of these was published by one of us in 2009 (40) and offers an example of long-lasting resolution of psychotic symptoms and the ability to completely discontinue antipsychotic medication.  Biological Plausibility  The biological plausibility that KDs may be of therapeutic benefit in major depression, bipolar illness, and schizophrenia is strongly supported by the scientific literature (18, 41–44).  Major Depression  Inflammation is implicated in all three conditions but has been most extensively studied in depression.",8f83d647-d752-48e0-96d5-1a79f2187eed
21,discussion3," Inflammation plays a role in the development and course of many cases of clinical depression and is associated with poor response to antidepressant medications (45, 46). The KD has been shown to reduce inflammation via complex influences on both central and peripheral immunoregulatory pathways (47–50). The KD also influences multiple neurotransmitter systems involved in depression, including the dopaminergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic systems (51).  Bipolar Disorder  Among those with bipolar illness, there is a higher prevalence of impaired glucose metabolism even in drug-naïve individuals (52). Calkin (53) found that those with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes are more likely to experience rapid mood cycling, less likely to respond to lithium, and more likely to suffer a more progressive disease course.",96ad1967-0a3a-4f62-839e-f6cb77a30b04
22,discussion4," Proposed mechanisms by which glucose and insulin dysregulation may dysregulate mood include damaging oxidative stress which, in turn, could impair mitochondrial function (16). Napolitano et al. (54) recently discovered that the KD can increase brain levels of glutathione, a ubiquitous intracellular antioxidant key to buffering oxidative stress. Campbell and Campbell (55) hypothesize that the KD might help ameliorate symptoms of bipolar illness by shifting the brain's primary fuel source from glucose to ketone bodies, thereby bypassing existing mitochondrial defects and reducing further mitochondrial injury. Calkin et al. (56) have proposed that insulin resistance, via inflammatory damage to endothelial cells, can compromise the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (blood brain barrier (BBB)) in people with bipolar illness.",64b654cf-562c-4800-9096-30373eaab537
23,discussion5," Interestingly, disruption of the tight junctions critical to blood brain barrier (BBB) structure and function has been observed not only in bipolar illness but also in major depression and schizophrenia (57).  Schizophrenia  Hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose metabolism are more common in treatment-naïve individuals experiencing first-episode psychosis than in the general population (58). While this association alone is insufficient to support a causal relationship between metabolic dysregulation and psychotic symptoms, several cases of acute hyperglycemia associated with transient psychotic symptoms in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have been reported (59). Pathophysiological features of schizophrenia shown in pre-clinical studies by Sarnyai et al. (44) to improve in response to a KD include N-methyl-D-aspartate (N methyl D aspartate (NMDA)) receptor hypofunction, sensory gating deficits, and glutamate excitotoxicity.",fa075ded-0e4e-44ca-83e2-d36bf1067a03
24,discussion6,"  KDs also help rebalance neurotransmitter systems, (16) stabilize neural networks (60), improve neuroplasticity (61), and bridge the energy gap resulting from the cerebral glucose hypometabolism associated with major depression, bipolar illness, and schizophrenia (17).  Strengths and Limitations  Unique strengths of this series include the diversity of psychiatric diagnoses and the relatively large number of patients exposed to the same intervention in the same semi-controlled clinical setting. It was with these elements in mind that we chose not to report these patient outcomes as individual case studies.",4007ac4e-0ddd-4435-8fe6-7d73f1d86ae4
25,discussion7," The provision of education, monitoring, and support by a psychiatrist who had trusting therapeutic alliances with his patients prior to the intervention seemed to contribute to patients' openness to the intervention and likely improved dietary adherence and honesty about transgressions, although this special treatment context makes it unclear whether these same outcomes would be possible under different circumstances.  Neither the treating psychiatrist responsible for assessing outcomes nor the patients themselves were blinded to the intervention, therefore there is a risk that impressions of clinical progress may have been biased. While patients may have benefited simply from having been hospitalized, a strength of this cohort is that all patients had previously been hospitalized under Dr. Danan's care at least once (and in many cases, multiple times) at either this same facility or a sister facility where all non-dietary aspects of care were very similar, yet Dr.",671059dc-e90e-4b90-a5e2-6a33d27459b0
26,discussion8," Danan reports never having observed this degree of clinical improvement in these patients before. These patients therefore might be considered to have served as their own historical comparison group, although mental health outcomes were not formally measured during previous hospitalizations.  As with any intervention in which ad libitum dietary patterns are replaced with a structured dietary pattern of interest, multiple dietary variables were manipulated, therefore even if it were possible to assign clinical benefits to the KD, it would still be difficult to determine which aspect(s) of the KD may be responsible for those benefits. For example, this iteration of the KD was not only low in carbohydrate—it was also grain-free, very low in processed foods, and supplemented with micronutrients. As KD meals and snacks were portion-controlled, patients may also have consumed fewer calories than usual.",7eb21668-972b-4ec2-846c-5be2f0e8b346
27,discussion9,"  It should also be noted that this setting did not allow for complete control over the dietary intervention, as participants were permitted to leave the unit on weekends, and while on the unit, could interact with nonparticipant patients who were served standard fare. As this was not a metabolic research ward, urine ketone monitoring (which can be helpful in assessing dietary adherence) was burdensome for busy staff, and therefore was conducted only once per patient. However, weight loss is another piece of evidence that patients were adherent to the dietary program, as most overweight or obese individuals will lose weight on a KD (24), and clinically meaningful weight loss in people with serious mental illness is otherwise unexpected, even when lifestyle interventions aimed at weight loss are implemented (62).",86baf8ed-5c13-41b9-ac2f-6569fd998406
28,discussion10," All but one patient lost weight including 96% of those who were taking antipsychotics, and nearly half achieved clinically significant weight loss [defined as ≥5% reduction in body weight (34)]. This welcome outcome alone makes a compelling case for the implementation of the KD in people who are taking antipsychotic medications, whether or not psychiatric symptoms improve in response to the KD, as counteracting antipsychotic-induced weight gain is extremely difficult (63).  Whether weight loss alone could lead to a reduction in symptoms of depression, bipolar disorder (64), and/or psychosis remains a largely unanswered question. In people with type 2 diabetes treated with a KD, improvement in depression symptoms was not correlated with weight loss (38).",0cc6628d-2d56-4abc-8010-c344a28553ca
29,discussion11," While studies find that people with clinical depression who have undergone bariatric surgery report fewer depression symptoms 6 months or more following the procedure, weight change appears to be an unreliable predictor of improvements in mood (65). We are unaware of any studies evaluating the impact of weight loss alone on symptoms of bipolar or psychotic illnesses.  Practical Considerations  Ketogenic diet protocols exist on a spectrum ranging from the “classic” KD originally used to treat medication-refractory pediatric epilepsy (90% fat, 6% protein, 4% carbohydrate) to modified KDs which allow for higher percentages of protein, to modified Atkins diets (66), in which protein may be eaten to satiety (67). The protocol Dr. Danan chose to adapt for use with his patients falls into this last category, although protein intake was limited in this setting to 15–20% of daily calories at least 6 days per week.",67053fc6-f437-4593-b5e3-bbdffacbd289
30,discussion12," One advantage of this more liberal approach is that precision control of macronutrient ratios is not required, easing the logistics of both administration and adherence.  In addition to rare metabolic disorders typically diagnosed in childhood, there are several health conditions considered by many to be absolute contraindications to initiating KDs in adults; these include acute pancreatitis, nephrolithiasis, renal failure, liver failure, congestive heart failure, anorexia nervosa, and concurrent use of SGLT2 inhibitors.  A well-formulated KD can quickly and effectively lower levels of blood glucose, insulin, and blood pressure—all considered clinically desirable goals in many patients, particularly those with metabolic syndrome. However, these generally beneficial physiological adaptations to the KD necessitate careful medication management.",5514a008-9d0c-430f-9bb5-0cbc52f1552d
31,discussion13," Medications that lower blood glucose (such as insulin, sulfonylureas, and meglitinides) and medications that lower blood pressure (such as diuretics and ACE inhibitors) warrant diligent monitoring as some may need to be reduced or even discontinued as early as day 1 of KD initiation to minimize the risk of hypoglycemic, hypotensive, and hypovolemic events (68, 69).  We are unaware of published research on the potential interactions between ketogenic diets and psychotropic medications with the notable exception of anticonvulsants. Studies of patients with epilepsy treated with a KD find that anticonvulsant levels can change in response to the diet. Although these changes are typically small and clinically inconsequential, valproate levels can fall significantly (70).",ca83f955-d3ed-4138-80b7-abfce3f514ca
32,discussion14," Since these agents have not yet been formally studied in people with psychiatric conditions, it would be prudent to monitor blood levels of all anticonvulsants as well as of any other psychiatric medications for which changes in blood level may be of clinical importance, such as lithium. With these cautions noted, for most adult patients, the potential benefits of simple, well-formulated KDs would seem to outweigh the potential risks (71).  As clinical response to the KD in this patient cohort typically occurred within 3 weeks or less, it should be noted that the highly variable and, in some cases, lengthy duration of hospitalization in this cohort was not related to the KD but largely to socioeconomic factors. In France, inpatient psychiatric care is cost-free for patients, bed availability is high, and hospitalization criteria are liberal, therefore stays lasting many months are commonplace.",44c100a7-bd15-4b7e-98ea-85580bf52330
33,discussion15," Given that this iteration of the KD was generally well tolerated and psychiatrically safe even in the complex cases that comprise this series, hospitalization may not be necessary so long as proper medical supervision is provided, particularly around medication management.  Key to the successful transition to a KD in any population is dietary education and support, and likely particularly important in this population was the provision of prepared meals and snacks, as depression, psychosis, and other serious psychiatric symptoms may otherwise have made the logistics of adopting and adhering to the KD (or any new diet) formidable. It is conceivable that a thoughtfully designed intensive outpatient program could provide the necessary structure and support for patients with serious mental illness to transition to a KD, and it is encouraging to see that nearly half of patients in this group managed to continue following a KD after discharge.",a6cd5bd3-505f-48de-9071-af647ff80c6a
34,discussion16,"  Future Research Considerations  Our observations warrant further research into the potential of the KD to improve the lives of people with mental illness. Many unanswered questions remain in this nascent field that carefully designed, adequately powered, randomized controlled trials—whether conducted in inpatient, outpatient, or virtual settings—could begin to address. As serum beta-hydroxybutyrate measurements are currently the most reliable method of assessing metabolic response to the KD, daily monitoring of this metric would help clinicians and patients understand whether the degree and consistency of ketosis are important to clinical outcomes.",5cde08b3-22d5-453b-8768-8bef058fdf5e
35,discussion17,"  Conclusion  In this retrospective analysis of clinical care, which to our knowledge represents the largest number of people with serious mental illness treated with a KD in a hospital setting thus far, we found that the KD was feasible, safe, well-tolerated, and associated with considerable improvements in mental health symptoms as well as in multiple markers of metabolic health. While more rigorous research is needed to confirm the association between the KD and improved mental health outcomes, these findings indicate that medically supervised carbohydrate restriction is a simple, safe, universally accessible intervention well worth considering as an adjunctive strategy in the treatment of serious mood and psychotic illnesses.
