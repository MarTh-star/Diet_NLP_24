0,methods0," We retrospectively evaluated the data of 119 infants with IS who underwent whole-exome sequencing (whole exome sequencing (WES)) before KD treatment. The KD efficacy was analyzed at the 16th week after initiation. Patients showing ≥ 50% seizure reduction from baseline and/or the disappeared hypsarrhythmia were considered as the responders. Chi-squared tests or two-sided Fisher's exact tests were performed for categorical data and Mann–Whitney U-tests for non-parametric and continuous data.   Patients  Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a 16-week ketogenic diet (KD) in IS patients with different pathogenic gene mutations. Totally 119 IS patients by KD treatment with prior Whole-exome sequencing (whole exome sequencing (WES)) test results were collected in this study in the Pediatric Department of Peking University First Hospital in China, from November 2017 to December 2018.

For whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis, genomic DNA fragments were captured by using the SSEL XT Human All Exon v6 kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A.) and sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.) sequencing platform with 150 bp paired-end reads. Raw data were transformed to fastq file by bcl2fastq inhouse package (Illumina). Exome data processing, sequence alignment to GRCh38/hg38 reference genome, variant calling, and variant annotation were performed by using BWA, SAMtools and Pica. Annotations of genetic variants were performed by ANNOVAR.",5fc8ca2e-52d1-471c-8d5a-99783413acf2
3,methods3," Further interpretation regarding pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variant of uncertain significance was performed following the criteria of American College of Medical Genetics (American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)), and further filtration was performed following two rules: (1) target genes were associated with the patients' phenotypes; (2) target genes were congregation in Trios.  Ketogenic Diet Intervention  Patients were instructed to follow a classic 3:1 KD diet by the attending pediatric epileptologists (8). According to the patient's age, height, and body weight, the recommended daily intake was calculated. Calories were restricted to 75% of the recommended daily intake. The patients were supplemented with daily required amounts of calcium, vitamins, and minerals, without sucrose and lactose. During KD treatment, the dosage of the primary anti-seizure medications was kept unchanged.",f50c7eb9-d992-4ecb-bc6d-a663d355e15b
4,methods4,"  Clinical Observation  Complete clinical data included detailed documentation of seizure frequencies and EEGs (at least for 4 h including awake and sleep phase). For the assessment of efficacy data, EEGs was recorded before and 16-weeks after the KD treatment. EEGs were scored according to the burden of amplitudes and epileptiform discharges (9).  The reduction in spasms and remission of hypsarrhythmia in EEG after the 16-weeks of treatment was used to indicate KD efficacy. The result was grouped into grade I (electro-clinical remission): epileptic spasms were completely controlled for at least 1-week with remission of hypsarrhythmia in EEG; grade II (partially effective): the frequency of epileptic spasms reduced by more than 50% and/or the remission of hypsarrhythmia in EEG; and grade III (ineffective): the frequency of epileptic spasms reduced by <50% with hypsarrhythmia.",12b7b2d3-5c13-4789-8021-7a088bcd4ad6
5,methods5," Patients after 16-week KD had definite efficacy data were classified as responder (grade I+II) or non-responder (grade III).  Statistical Analysis  Comparisons between two groups were performed using chi-square tests or two-sided Fisher's exact tests for categorical data and using Mann–Whitney U-tests for non-parametric and continuous data. All statistical analyses were done with SPSS 26.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Clinical variables included age at seizure onset, age at KD initiation, lead time from seizure onset to KD initiation, gender, and identified genetic etiology. The median age of patients at seizure onset and KD initiation were 5.00 months (interquartile range (IQR) = 3.00–8.00 months) and 17.00 months (interquartile range (IQR) = 11.00–23.00 months), respectively. And the medium lead time from seizure onset to KD initiation was 10.00 months (interquartile range (IQR) = 6.00–16.00 months).

7,results1," No statistical differences were found between responders and non-responders with respect to clinical variables including the age at seizure onset, age at KD initiation, lead time from seizure onset to KD and genetic mutations. However, there was a significant difference between KD responders and non-responders in terms of gender (p = 0.04), i.e., females tended to respond better to the KD treatment. In addition, there was no significant association between whether a patient carried a IS-related mutation and their response to KD treatment (p = 0.89).

9,results4,"88%) patients were responders and the other 17 (53.12%) were considered as non-responders to KD therapy. The most common mutations were in the cyclin dependent kinase like 5 (CDKL5) gene (n = 8 [25.00%]) and potassium sodium-activated channel subfamily T member 1 (KCNT1) gene (n = 8 [25.00%]), followed by solute carrier family 35 member A2 (SLC35A2) (n = 5 [15.63%]), protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) (n = 4 [12.50%]), syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) (n = 4 [12.50%]) and asparagine-linked glycosylation 13 (ALG13) gene (n = 3 [9.37%]). To explore the relation between efficacy of KD and causative monogenic gene, the patients were classified as responder (grade I+II) or non-responder (grade III) group. In order to evaluate the efficacy of KD in infantile spasms (IS) with one specific mutated gene, the efficacy of KD in patients with each specific mutated gene was compared with that of those patients without the mutation in that gene.",d08b619b-fb2c-424f-8fe3-0cfad3d15de5
10,results5," Responder rate to KD of the patients with mutations in CDKL5 (responder rate = 87.50%; p = 0.03) was significantly higher than responder rate of the patients without CDKL5 mutation. Responder rate of patients with ALG13mutations (responder rate = 100%; p = 0.11) was higher than responder rate of patients without ALG3 mutation, and responder rate of patients with mutations in KCNT1 (responder rate = 37.5%; p = 0.72), SLC35A2 (responder rate = 20.00%; p = 0.37), PCDH19 (responder rate = 25.00%; p = 0.62) or STXBP1 (responder rate = 0; p = 0.12) was lower than responder rate of patients without the respective gene mutations (Table 3 and Figure 1).

11,results7," Furthermore, among the CDKL5 coding mutations, five of them were truncation mutations that directly influenced different functional motifs of CDKL5 protein, such as the ATP binding site, Ser/Thr kinase active site, Thr/Glu/Tyr motif, nuclear localization signal (nuclear localization signal (NLS)), and nuclear export signal (nuclear export signal (NES)). And the other 2 mutations were missense mutations in the catalytic domain. One patient whose mutation was truncation without loss of the functional motifs did not respond to KD treatment (Figure 2). Moreover, all genetic variations in ALG13 in three patients were clustered in exon 2 or 3, and all three patients were responders to KD treatment. But all four patients with STXBP1 variations did not respond to KD treatment. Genetic features of other causative monogenic mutations are shown in Table 4.",d0932eaa-a804-4502-981d-cd6e721b74cd
12,results8," Taken together, these results indicated that different IS-associated genetic mutations had a differential influence on the patient's response to KD therapy, suggesting the involvement of diverse disease mechanisms in the onset of IS.

13,discussion0," KD has become increasingly popular as one of the non-pharmacological treatment options for pediatric patients with IS (10). In this study, 57 (47.90%) patients were considered as the KD responders, consistent with earlier KD treatment reports showing about 50% response for IS at 12 or 13 months (11, 12), which suggested that KD therapy could cure a subset of patients with IS. Here, the significant differences we observed between KD responders and non-responders in terms of gender are consistent with previous KD treatment for epilepsy studies (13). Female mice with epilepsy benefited more in KD, suggesting that differences in KD-treated mice may be related to gender-related β-hydroxybutyrate levels (14, 15). Thus, KD therapy might be more effective in girls than in boys. Although the median lead time of the responders' group and the non-responders' group was 9 and 12 months, respectively. The lead time from seizure onset to KD showed no significant difference with response to KD (P = 0.",4edd6f1a-3e08-4b82-ba5c-3d141f97dfe2
14,discussion1,"06), which might be related to the small sample size in this study.  whole exome sequencing (WES) has been widely utilized to detect the causative mutations in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, mental disorders, and IS (16). In this study, the molecular diagnostic rate was 26.89% for 119 patients with IS, which was consistent with previous studies (17, 18). In addition, the age at seizure onset and gender were significantly correlated with identified genes in this study. Thus, we deduced that disease-causing genetic mutations were more likely to occur in patients with early-onset IS. Moreover, the proportion of boys was significantly lower than girls in patients with identified mutations, suggesting that pathogenic gene mutations were more likely to occur in female patients with IS.  Understanding of the genetic etiology can be helpful to predict the efficacy of KD treatment for patients with IS (19).",bbc70fcf-033e-4067-956a-7dd4eadd7cd9
15,discussion2," Prediction on patients who respond to KD therapy can be difficult. KD is a well-established treatment for patients with specific metabolic disorders, i.e., GLUT1 deficiency. In our study, there was no significant difference between the patient groups (with vs. without molecular diagnosis) in terms of response rate. However, the negative molecular diagnosis might be due to the technical limitations on the detection of the mutations in this study. KD therapy was considered to be the most effective way to treat patients with SLC2A1 gene mutations. Unfortunately, we did not detect any such variant in our IS cohort. Therefore, the efficacy of KD in patients with each gene was compared with those of patients without the same gene. Patients with CDKL5 mutations exhibited significantly favorable responses to KD treatment.",beb7e4d7-5b83-4fec-83f6-27daa6e53cc3
16,discussion3," Patients with KCNT1, ALG13, SLC35A2, PCDH19, or STXBP1 mutations showed non-significantly favorable responses to KD compared to the responses without the same genetic mutations. This is consistent with the results from previous trials that showed a better response to KD in children with specific syndromes, especially those with CDKL5 mutations (20, 21). Thus, the efficacy of KD was different in patients with various types of pathogenic mutations and was more effective in patients with CDKL5 mutation-induced IS. CDKL5, as a serine-threonine kinase plays an important role in alternative splicing, neuronal morphogenesis, dendritic arborization, and energy metabolism (21). In this study, all mutations except for p.N267fs*5 produced proteins with presumably affected functional motifs, seven out of eight patients with these mutations responded effectively to KD treatment. Lim et al.",52abd20f-04a5-404a-a2da-bf742136fd14
17,discussion4," (20) have found that patients harboring missense and/or in-frame variants within the catalytic domain tended to need a longer period of time for KD treatment to be effective than those carrying non-functional protein-truncating variants. These findings indicated that the KD was effective in patients with CDKL5 mutations that could affect important motifs of CDKL5 protein (20, 22). Thus, the KD might be an optimal treatment for IS infants with CDKL5 mutations.  All 3 cases with ALG13 mutations responded effectively to KD. ALG13 gene encodes a crucial protein involved in the process of N-linked glycosylation, and abnormal N-linked glycosylation leads to neurological deficits and disorders (23). In this study, although patients with ALG13 mutations had non-significantly favorable responses to KD than those without ALG13, all three patients with ALG13 mutations were responders to KD. Bobby et al. (24) reported that 9 out of 12 patients with ALG13 mutations responded to KD treatment.",9b790741-1e1c-4326-bdf6-daf0e24db8a0
18,discussion5," KD treatment for IS patients with ALG13 mutations was considered as an efficient therapy.  STXBP1 is an essential protein for presynaptic vesicle release. Four patients with STXBP1 mutations in our study had no response to KD treatment. Li et al. (25) has reported a case with STXBP1 mutations also had no response to a two-year KD treatment. Li et al. (26) reported three patients, of whom two failed to respond, and one female patient was seizure-free after KD treatment for 1-week. Therefore, it is suggested that KD therapy is not suitable for patients with STXBP1 mutations.  Several limitations of this study should be noted, including the small sample size thus a few IS-related genes/variants were studied and short follow-up period. Therefore, additional prospective studies including a larger number and greater diversity of genes/variants, more complete clinical data, and long-term evaluation are required to confirm our findings.",b61f6ab6-e1eb-4f61-9a3d-945d8755064c
19,discussion6,"  Conclusions  Collectively, our findings suggested that KD is an effective treatment for the patients with IS. Female patients exhibited a comparatively better response to KD therapy than male subjects. whole exome sequencing (WES) yielded a higher diagnostic rate among younger or female patients with IS. The KD treatment was particularly effective in patients with IS caused by CDKL5 mutations influencing the protein kinase motifs. However, KD was not effective in patients with IS caused by KCNT1, SLC35A2, PCDH19, and STXBP1 mutations. These results will provide rational evidence for effective treatment for patients with IS.
