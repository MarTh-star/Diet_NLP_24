0,introduction0," Efforts to provide individualized dietary recommendations based on genetic markers have been underway for several years. However, these efforts have largely detected alleles with small-effect sizes that are not clinically actionable [1–3]. As with studies investigating responses to other environmental factors, responses to diet are likely not due to the action of single alleles with a large effect, but rather the sum of multiple small-effect alleles, interactions among alleles, epigenetic modifications, and sex.  Recently, our group observed strong mouse strain-specific differences in response to feeding different human-relevant diets [4–6]. This initial study provided evidence for striking differences between C57BL/6J (B6) and FVB/NJ (FVB)/NJ (FVB/NJ (FVB)) mice in response to high-fat diets varying in carbohydrate content.",633c2881-acc6-469f-b0c9-dd9ff32e8380
1,introduction1," Although studies increasingly consider the role of sex as a biological variable, the role of sex in the response to diets with varied macronutrient contents has been understudied [7].  To further investigate the genetic origin of differential response to carbohydrate restriction and sensitivity to high-fat diets, we generated an intercross population (F2) between B6 and FVB/NJ (FVB). All F2s were fed either an American (35% of energy from fat, 50% from carbohydrate) or a ketogenic (84% of energy from fat, 0% from carbohydrate) diet and changes to body composition and serum cholesterol concentrations were measured. In this population, we performed genome-wide linkage analysis to elucidate the genetic architecture contributing to differential responses to the specific diets. The data obtained provide evidence for genetic loci that not only directly affect body composition response but also loci that indirectly affect response through differences in serum cholesterol concentration.",2d037d59-9d4e-40ae-a14a-91882d015417
2,introduction2," In addition, significant sex differences in the effects of the identified quantitative trait loci (quantitative trait loci (QTL)) were detected. ",6c235507-1402-483d-891f-3eb0f8c834bf
3,methods0," Animals and diets  Initially, we screened 6-week-old B6 and FVB/NJ (FVB) mice for their response to American (35% of energy from fat, 50% from carbohydrates) and ketogenic (84% of energy from fat, 0% from carbohydrates) diets after a 6-month feeding trial. These strains have previously exhibited significantly different responses to these two diets [4]. Detailed diet compositions are provided in Supplementary Table 1. B6 females were crossed with FVB/NJ (FVB) males to generate F1 mice and subsequently intercrossed to generate the F2 population. Four-week-old F1s and 3–5 week-old F2s were screened for their response to American and ketogenic diets during a 3-month feeding trial.  For the feeding trials, mice were randomly assigned to one of the two diet groups.",e0091a6b-2d9f-4375-b43c-21d25e503eb5
4,methods1," Half of the B6, FVB/NJ (FVB), F1, and F2 mice were placed on American diet (B6: 11 males, 9 females, FVB/NJ (FVB): 10 males, 10 females, F1: 6 males, 6 females, F2: 102 males, 122 females) and a half on the ketogenic diet (B6: 9 males, 10 females, FVB/NJ (FVB): 10 males, 10 females, F1: 6 females, 9 males, F2: 126 males, 119 females). Researchers were not blinded to diet assignments. All animals were maintained in accordance with Texas A&M University Institution Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines at 22 °C under a 12-h light cycle. At the end of the feeding trial, mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, blood was collected, and tissues were harvested and immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Phenotyping  Echo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRI)) (Echomagnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRI), Houston, TX, USA) was used to measure the fat and lean mass of all individuals.",326d7cce-b79f-4781-876b-dda038117c3a
5,methods2," During the initial screen of the B6 and FVB/NJ (FVB) strains, body weight and body composition were measured at a 3-month time point of the 6-month feeding trial. In the F1 population, body weight and body composition were measured at the beginning and end of the 3-month feeding trial. The fat percentage of total body weight was calculated at the 3-month timepoint for B6, FVB/NJ (FVB), and F1 populations. Fat percentage is the percentage of total body fat mass measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRI) relative to body weight at the time of the magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRI) measurement. In the F2 population, body weight and body composition from before and after the 3-month feeding trial allowed for changes in fat and lean mass to be calculated. Fat and lean mass gains were calculated as the difference in fat and lean mass prior to the feeding trial and after 3 months on the assigned diet.",a4b5fa30-4d6f-4d04-aaf1-3262b26cce20
6,methods3,"  In the F2 population, total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL fractions, as well as APOA2 were measured in serum obtained from blood at sacrifice at the end of the feeding trial. Total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL measurements were performed in duplicate using the EnzyChrom AF HDL and LDL/VLDL Assay kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA). APOA2 measurements were performed in duplicate in a subset of the F2 population with the highest and lowest serum HDL cholesterol concentration (11 males, 27 females), using the Mouse Apolipoprotein A2 ELISA kit (ABclonal cat no. RK02605, Woburn, MA, USA).  Genotyping  The F2 population was genotyped on the Mouse Universal Genotyping Array (Mouse Universal Genotyping Array (MUGA)) that includes 7854 SNP markers [8]. Markers that were not polymorphic between B6 and FVB/NJ (FVB) were removed from the dataset and uncertain genotype calls for individuals (GenCall score quality metric <0.7) were set to missing.",7535b675-29ed-4be9-a635-8cc1dec9da7e
7,methods4," The remaining markers were used to generate a genetic map to check for problematic markers and/or sample DNAs. After all corrections, 1667 markers were used for the association analyses. Updated Mouse Universal Genotyping Array (MUGA) marker annotation was obtained from Dr. Karl Broman (https://kbroman.org/Mouse Universal Genotyping Array (MUGA)arrays/new_annotations.html).  Heritability calculations  Broad-sense heritability for body fat percentage was calculated as the ratio of total genetic variance (variance in the F2 population) to environmental variance (variance in the F1 population).  Quantitative trait loci analysis  Outliers can have a strong influence on the results of quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses. We observed biologically implausible errors in data that were greater than three standard deviations from the mean and suspect that these reflect the technical errors in the measurements.",b217fb50-db80-4875-949a-fecb4232f6c9
8,methods5," As such, outliers were defined as individuals with phenotypes that were more than three standard deviations away from the mean for each sex and phenotype in the F2 population. Outliers were set to missing. This procedure was repeated iteratively to discover all outliers in the data. Pearson’s correlation between phenotypes was determined after correcting for sex and diet effects (Supplementary Fig. 1). Code available by request.  The combined model includes all F2s, both sexes, and both diets (y~ sex * diet + marker). quantitative trait loci (QTL) peaks with a logarithm of the odds (logarithm of the odds (LOD)) greater than thresholds determined by 10,000 permutations were considered genome-wide significant (P < 0.05, logarithm of the odds (LOD) > 3.90) or highly significant (P < 0.01, logarithm of the odds (LOD) > 4.70).

9,methods6,"5 logarithm of the odds (LOD) from the top marker was used to determine the 95% confidence intervals, or support intervals, for each quantitative trait loci (QTL). Linear models using ANOVA was used to check for any interactions between sex and/or diet with the top markers of each quantitative trait loci (QTL). The variance explained by the top markers at each quantitative trait loci (QTL) was calculated by dividing the sum of squares of the model including the top marker by the total sum of squares of the model without quantitative trait loci (QTL).  Candidate gene analysis using KEGG  KEGG pathways are a collection of pathway maps that reflect known genetic and metabolic relationships. All genes within each significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) confidence interval were annotated with KEGG pathway identifiers.",1112e151-aabc-42e2-9321-8b47df9609c3
10,methods7," We further characterized our candidate genes by KEGG pathways related to glucose, insulin, fatty acids, adipocytes, cholesterol, obesity, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. A comprehensive list of KEGG pathway queries is provided in Supplementary Table S4.  Conditioned and unconditioned linkage analysis  We performed a set of conditional quantitative trait loci (QTL) scans using traits as covariates in the analysis of other traits based on the individual quantitative trait loci (QTL) that were identified for each trait and suspected biological relationships. If conditioning the genome scan with a covariate resulted in a significant increase or decrease in the absolute value of the logarithm of the odds (LOD) score, it was interpreted that the traits are causally related to one another.",31cd5d08-1074-4846-9adf-72b0750d4d04
11,methods8," When comparing conditioned and unconditioned quantitative trait loci (QTL) scans, an increase or decrease in the logarithm of the odds (LOD) of at least 2.0 corresponds to a 5% type I error rate [9, 10]. Only conditioned genome scans that resulted in a change of 2.0 logarithm of the odds (LOD) were considered pleiotropic, or shared, quantitative trait loci (QTL) between the two traits.  Causal network inferences  For traits with overlapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) we made causal inferences in networks based on methods described elsewhere [11]. Briefly, the first trait (T1) was regressed on the second trait (T2) and T2 was regressed on T1 in order to obtain the residual of each trait after adjusting for the other (R1 and R2). A bivariate t test between R1, R2, and the shared locus was used to infer the causal network among them. P values were Holm–Bonferroni corrected for the number of tests (i.e., number of residuals tested = 2) where P = α0.",db29ff94-be90-4215-856b-0aa3f2f858d2
12,methods9,"05/(number of tests – rank of ith hypothesis +1). A P value < 0.05 is considered significant. An initial pathway describing the relationship between T1 and T2 was defined based on the inferred causal networks, and the predicted causal models were compared with the Akaike’s information criterion (Akaike’s information criterion (AIC)) and Bayesian information criterion (Bayesian information criterion (BIC)). A lower Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) indicates a better model.  Structural equation modeling  Structural equation modeling was used to illustrate observed and unobserved relationships between the quantitative trait loci (QTL) models. The models were refined until all path coefficients were significantly different from zero. Linear models using ANOVA was used to check for the amount of variation explained by each predictor in the structural model.",9f3329d0-1070-401f-9078-446c8e68ba11
13,methods10, The proportion of variation explained with the predictors modeled was calculated by dividing the sum of squares of the model including the predictor by the total sum of squares without the predictor.  Quantitative PCR (qPCR)  RNA from flash-frozen gonadal fat and liver were extracted using the simplyRNA Tissue kit on a Maxwell AS3000 (Promega). cDNA was generated using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Roche). qPCRs were performed on a LightCycler 480 (Roche) and CFX384 (BioRad) with LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master reagent (Roche). B2m was used as a housekeeping gene to correct for starting amounts of cDNA in both gonadal fat and liver.

14,results0," Genetic background and sex modulate parental strain fat differences  The fat percentage of B6 males consuming an American diet was 1.77-fold higher compared to B6 males consuming a ketogenic diet (B6 male American: 27.4 ± 5.2%, B6 male ketogenic: 15.5 ± 7.1%, P = 0.001, CI = 5.8–18.0%; Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3). Conversely, B6 females and FVB/NJ (FVB) males and females fed the same two diets did not show diet-dependent differences of body fat percentage (B6 female American: 20.7 ± 8.8%, B6 female ketogenic: 17.2 ± 5.7%; FVB/NJ (FVB) male American: 18.1 ± 6.9%, FVB/NJ (FVB) male ketogenic: 20.4 ± 7.5%; FVB/NJ (FVB) female American: 13.4 ± 6.7%, FVB/NJ (FVB) female ketogenic: 16.2 ± 6.4%; Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3). The mean fat percentage in B6 males on the ketogenic diet is lower than the fat percentage in FVB/NJ (FVB) males on the ketogenic diet, although the difference is not statistically significant (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3).Fig.",548d1566-8746-4a1b-a48f-80458b2536fc

This trend persists in the F1 population where F1 males on the ketogenic diet have a lower percentage of body fat than F1 males on the American diet. The F1 males on the ketogenic diet also have a significantly higher percentage of body fat than B6 males on the ketogenic diet.  Sex modulates hybrid population fat differences  The F1 males, but not females, also responded to the ketogenic diet.

Sex and diet modulate phenotypes in the F2 population  As expected, sex had a profound effect on the phenotypes used for analysis (Supplementary Table 3). This effect was greater than the effect of diet for all phenotypes (Supplementary Table 3). Regardless of the carbohydrate composition of the diet, females had lower fat mass gain than males (F2 females, 4.5 ± 3.0 g, F2 males, 8.2 ± 4.5 g, P < 0.001, CI = 2.8–4.2 g), lower lean mass gain than males (F2 females, 5.5 ± 1.6 g, F2 males, 9.0 ± 3.2 g, P < 0.001, CI = 3.0–3.9 g), and lower serum HDL cholesterol concentration than males (F2 females, 157.6 ± 58.3 ng/mL, F2 males, 201.6 ± 32.5 ng/mL, P < 0.001, CI = 34.9–53.0 ng/mL).",50bf37f8-fd6e-436b-bf05-8e4fdaff8d19

22,results9,"  We expected that FVB/NJ (FVB) alleles would drive higher fat mass gain across the genome based on the initial screen of B6 and FVB/NJ (FVB) showing that B6 males have a differential response to American and ketogenic diets, while FVB/NJ (FVB) mice do not have a differential response to these two high-fat diets. Surprisingly, the FVB/NJ (FVB) allele contributes to lower fat mass gain in response to the ketogenic diet at the most highly significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) at Fmgq2 as well as Fmgq3, but higher fat mass gain at Fmgq1.  In the initial analysis of fat percentage in B6, FVB/NJ (FVB), and F1 populations, we also observed that the male response to the ketogenic diet was greater in the F1 population compared to the B6 parent strain (Fig. 1). This prompted us to test if the combination of parent alleles at Fmgq1 with either Fmgq2 or Fmgq3 resulted in a higher fat mass gain in the F2 population.

28,results15,"  KEGG pathway annotation of candidate genes at Fmgq1 and Fmgq2 highlights steroid hormone biosynthesis  We searched for candidate genes that might elucidate the functional interaction between Fmgq1 and Fmgq2. Out of 98 positional candidate genes, 4 genes at Fmgq1 are found on metabolically relevant KEGG pathways: Hsd11b1 (steroid hormone biosynthesis; mmu00140), Ephx1 (bile secretion; mmu004976), Camk1g (aldosterone synthesis and secretion; mmu004925), and Ppp2r5a (AMPK signaling pathway; mmu004152) (Table 2). Out of 482 positional candidate genes, 2 genes at Fmgq2 are found on metabolically relevant KEGG pathways: Srd5a3 (steroid hormone biosynthesis; mmu00140) and Cox7b2 (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; mmu004932) (Table 2).Table 2 Candidate genes in quantitative trait loci (QTL) confidence intervals for Fmg1 and Fmg2 were annotated with metabolically relevant KEGG pathways.",5a93db01-3699-4551-b549-e417e130473a

30,results17," Consistent with Srd5a3 underlying Fmgq2, we observed lower expression of Srd5a3 in gonadal fat of F2s that are homozygous for the FVB/NJ (FVB) allele at Fmgq2 relative to F2s that are homozygous for the B6 allele at Fmgq2 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, we also observe a 1.59-fold increase in Srd5a3 expression in F2s that are B6/B6 at Fmgq2 and carry FVB/NJ (FVB)/FVB/NJ (FVB) alleles at Fmgq1 relative to F2s that are B6/B6 at both loci (Fig. 3C). This makes Srd5a3 a strong candidate gene at Fmgq2 and for the functional interaction between Fmgq1 and Fmgq2.  At Fmgq1, we did not observe any genotype-dependent differences in expression of Hsd11b1 (liver), Ephx1 (liver), or Ppp2r5a (gonadal fat) (Supplementary Fig. S6ABC). We did, however, observe a 1.61-fold increase in Ppp2r5a expression in F2s that are B6/B6 at Fmgq2 and carry FVB/NJ (FVB)/FVB/NJ (FVB) alleles at Fmgq1 relative to F2s that are B6/B6 at both loci (Fig. 3D).",db699acc-8a7a-4934-b02b-65cb87da6fd0

The remaining candidate at Fmgq1, Camk1g, is exclusively expressed in brain tissue, which was unavailable to measure expression. Given the involvement of Camk1g in aldosterone synthesis and secretion, we instead measured serum aldosterone concentration (after the feeding trial) and observed no genotype-dependent differences (Supplementary Fig. S6D). The remaining candidate at Fmgq2, Cox7b2 is expressed exclusively in the testis, which was unavailable to measure its expression.  Conditioned linkage analysis of fat and lean mass gain  Fmgq2 and Lmgq1 overlap in the combined model of F2s that includes both sexes and diets. For both traits, this quantitative trait loci (QTL) appears to be driven largely by males on the ketogenic diet. This shared quantitative trait loci (QTL) prompted us to model the relationship between fat and lean mass gain.",bbfa5268-832a-46c3-9b5d-baf871e5906b
32,results19," There is no significant change to the logarithm of the odds (LOD) score on Chr5 at 73.7 Mb when the fat mass gain is conditioned on the lean mass gain, nor when the lean mass gain is conditioned on fat mass gain. Thus, the relationship between fat and lean mass gain at this locus could not be elucidated in this model. This would suggest that the overlapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) region harbors one or two tightly linked genes that affect both lean and fat mass in the same direction.  Conditioned linkage analysis of fat mass gain and serum HDL cholesterol concentration  The close proximity of Hdlq1 and Fmgq1 in the combined models prompted us to model the relationship between fat mass gain and serum HDL cholesterol concentration at these loci. We observed that when the fat mass gain is conditioned on serum HDL cholesterol concentration, there is no significant change to the logarithm of the odds (LOD) score on Chr1 at 191.6 Mb (Table 3).",e73b8a68-3955-45f9-9986-751571d43081

Causal network between Fmgq1, fat mass gain, and serum HDL cholesterol concentration  We also explored causal networks between fat mass gain and serum HDL cholesterol concentration at Fmgq1. After adjusting for multiple testing, the inferred network shows that serum HDL cholesterol concentration and fat mass gain are independently related to Fmgq1 (Table 3).",b6db640c-250b-4faf-9cfe-230b51095a2a
36,results23," The Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) model selection scores suggest that the model in which serum HDL cholesterol concentration occurs upstream of fat mass gain at Fmgq1 is most consistent with the data (Table 3).  Structural equation modeling of fat mass gain and serum HDL cholesterol concentration  We built a structural model from this inferred network to illustrate the magnitude of the effects of each predictor in the models of fat mass gain and serum HDL cholesterol concentration (Fig. 3E). The path coefficients are all significantly different from zero (Table 3). The proportion of variation explained with the predictors modeled for fat mass gain and serum HDL cholesterol concentration is 29.95% and 27.00%, respectively. ",12aba392-5169-4844-824e-05ea45f9e7ab
37,discussion0," This study provides evidence that individual responses to a high-fat diet significantly depends upon three factors: (1) the presence or absence of carbohydrates in the high-fat diet; (2) the combination of alleles occurring in the study population; and (3) sex. In our experiment, B6 males have a lower percentage of body fat in response to the high fat, no carbohydrate, ketogenic diet, while in contrast, B6 females and FVB/NJ (FVB) males and females do not have a differential response to American and ketogenic diets. This sex-specific response to carbohydrate restriction on ketogenic diet observed in B6 males persists in F1s males, and we observed that the combination of B6 and FVB/NJ (FVB) alleles in the hybrids results in a higher percentage of body fat in response to the feeding trial. The difference in ages at the beginning of the parent and F1 feeding trials might also contribute to the higher percentage of body fat we observed in the F1s.",3eea9325-4a02-4689-a7ad-ecd7aa844f2c
38,discussion1," In the F2 population, we observed a very high heritability for fat mass gain in both sexes and were able to identify significant quantitative trait loci (QTL)s for fat mass gain at Fmgq1, Fmgq2, and Fmgq3. This raises the question of whether these loci could be used to make predictions about the individual responses to carbohydrate restriction. Fmgq2 explains the most variation in the fat mass gain in males on the ketogenic diet. We observed that the FVB/NJ (FVB) allele drives lower fat mass gain at Fmgq2 and Fmgq3, while at Fmgq1 the FVB/NJ (FVB) allele drives higher fat mass gain. In addition, we provided evidence that male F2s exposed to the ketogenic diet that is homozygous for B6 alleles at Fmgq2 and carry at least one FVB/NJ (FVB) allele at Fmgq1 gain the most fat mass during the feeding trial. We observed that Fmgq2 and Lmgq1 represent the same quantitative trait loci (QTL) on Chr5 for fat and lean mass gain.",bd9bab65-f290-47e5-82db-3b355869bd65
39,discussion2," Likely, a single gene or two tightly linked genes are responsible for the change in lean and fat mass.  The quantitative trait loci (QTL) for serum HDL cholesterol concentration at Hdlq1 is significant in both males and females and contains Apoa2. Apoa2 has been described repeatedly for its relationship to serum HDL cholesterol concentration, especially in these two strains [12–14]. The initial observation of the Apoa2 locus affecting serum concentrations of HDL cholesterol was made in an association study of females using an advanced intercross line between B6 and NZB/BINJ [12]. Later, in a panel of inbred strains that included B6 and FVB/NJ (FVB) mice, it was determined that the amino acid substitution Ala61Val in APOA2 led to increased serum HDL concentrations [13]. B6 carry Ala61 while FVB/NJ (FVB) mice carry amino acid substitution 61Val. Both males and females of all strains carrying the 61Val had increased serum HDL cholesterol concentrations.",833f606e-4efc-4477-a42d-5b93dbbc64b3
40,discussion3," The results of our linkage analysis for serum cholesterol concentrations are consistent with the amino acid differences. They show that Hdlq1 affects HDL in males and females. We confirmed that FVB/NJ (FVB) alleles at Hdlq1 drive higher concentrations of serum HDL cholesterol and serum APOA2.  In our causal network of the relationship between fat mass gain and serum HDL cholesterol concentration, we found that serum HDL cholesterol concentration and fat mass gain are independently linked to Fmgq1. The close proximity of the Fmgq1 and Hdlq1 quantitative trait loci (QTL)s puts them in linkage disequilibrium and this makes their direct and indirect effects difficult to detangle. In general, we would have expected that serum HDL cholesterol concentration would have a negative relationship with fat mass gain given the well-established relationship between serum HDL cholesterol and obesity in humans.",124cdf81-df1e-447d-9263-fd415c72b637
41,discussion4," It is likely that the two traits are independently linked to Fmgq1 because of the linkage disequilibrium. However, the Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) scores for the models suggest that differences in serum HDL cholesterol concentration occur upstream of the differences we observe in fat mass gain at Fmgq1.  Overlaying genes within Fmgq1 and Fmgq2 onto metabolically relevant KEGG pathways revealed candidate genes involved in the biogenesis of cortisol (Hsd11b1), aldosterone (Camk1g), and testosterone (Srd5a3). Cholesterol falls upstream of the production of each of these steroid hormones. Ephx1 resides inside of Fmgq1 and plays a role in the transfer of bile acids to the liver, a process that is critical for the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol. Each of these candidate genes has in common, a relationship with cholesterol.",612e7a50-7469-4555-9a38-887ebd231ff8
42,discussion5," This offers insight into the role these particular genes could play in the causal network we inferred that showed serum HDL cholesterol concentration occurring upstream of fat mass gain. The inferred network might be reflective of the relationship between fat mass gain and one of these candidate genes more so than a direct relationship between serum HDL cholesterol concentration and fat mass gain.  Further, our candidate genes offer insight into the sex-specific interaction in males on the ketogenic diet that we observed between Fmgq1 and Fmgq2. Our most prominent quantitative trait loci (QTL) at Fmgq2 harbors Srd5a3 that converts inactive testosterone to active dihydrotestosterone. We confirmed that F2s that are homozygous for FVB/NJ (FVB) alleles at Fmgq2 express Srd5a3 less than F2s that are homozygous for B6 alleles. At this quantitative trait loci (QTL), FVB/NJ (FVB) alleles also drive lower fat mass gain.",e00ce686-8d07-46f2-a17d-284912e95f99
43,discussion6," This suggests that more active dihydrotestosterone promotes more fat mass gain at Fmgq2. The functional interaction we observed between Fmgq1 and Fmgq2 showed us that male F2s that are homozygous B6 at Fmgq2 and carry at least one FVB/NJ (FVB) allele at Fmgq1 gained the most fat mass. Interestingly, we observed that F2s that carry this interaction have a 1.59-fold increase in expression of Srd5a3 relative to animals that are homozygous B6 at both Fmgq1 and Fmgq2. This provides further evidence that more active dihydrotestosterone promotes more fat mass gain in this population. Ppp2r5a at Fmgq1 has been associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)) through pathway analysis of genes enriched in genome-wide association studies (genome wide association studies (GWAS)).",608ee565-25fe-4ce5-900e-4a2b6dedb99d
44,discussion7," Ppp2r5a is a member of the oocyte meiosis KEGG pathway that was significantly associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a pathway affected by the hyperandrogenemia that frequently occurs with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [15]. The association of Ppp2r5a with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) makes Srd5a3, and Ppp2r5a primary candidate genes of interest for further investigation.  Each of the remaining candidate genes has a potential relationship with Srd5a3 and active dihydrotestosterone levels. Hsd11b1 at Fmgq1 reversibly converts active cortisol to inactive cortisone. Epidemiological data in humans show that the ratio of androgens to glucocorticoids is critical to metabolic homeostasis and alterations in this ratio can lead to increased incidence of obesity and metabolic syndrome [16].",759880ff-927b-4a8d-ae31-fee0dc6bdbc2
45,discussion8," In addition, excessive levels of active dihydrotestosterone have been shown to stimulate aldosterone secretion by a mechanism that is dependent upon the calmodulin/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C intracellular signaling pathways [17]. Camk1g at Fmgq1 is a member of this pathway and people with obesity often experience hyperaldosteronism [18]. Ephx1 at Fmgq1 has previously been associated with other Srd5a isoforms in genome wide association studies (GWAS) of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [19], and similarly, Cox7b2 at Fmgq2, has been identified in another genome wide association studies (GWAS) for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [20]. The association with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) establishes a probable link between both Ephx1 and Cox7b2 and abnormal androgen secretion.  Sequence variation between B6 and FVB/NJ (FVB) result in amino acid changes in EPHX1, CAMK1G, and PPP2R5A, sometimes at multiple locations within the proteins.",c7488278-bd39-43d5-ad29-4abe249a8590
46,discussion9," In HSD11B1 and SRD5A3, no amino acid changes have been documented, but sequence variation in Hsd11b1 and Srd5a3 does result in noncoding transcript variants that might be of interest in further investigation. These noncoding transcript variants would suggest differences in expression of relevant candidate genes like we observed for Srd5a3. However, we did not observe genotype-dependent differences in expression of Hsd11b1, but did find in the F2 population that mice that are B6/B6 at Fmgq2 and carry FVB/NJ (FVB)/FVB/NJ (FVB) alleles at Fmgq1 express Ppp2r5a 1.61-fold more than F2s that are B6/B6 at both loci.  Overall, our data parallel a clinical trial showing a greater fat mass loss among men than women on very low energy, ketogenic diet [21–23]. The differences could not be attributed to the attenuation of appetite-stimulating hormones, and concentrations of serum steroid hormones were not considered in the study.",54252fa8-9fa1-4551-8323-19b584353553
47,discussion10," Unfortunately, studies in humans that utilize very low carbohydrate, ketogenic diets typically lack the power to detect sex differences or fail to incorporate realistic control diets [24–28]. Nonetheless, meta-analyses of human, genome-wide association studies of body mass index and waist-to-hip circumference have identified several sex-specific loci [29–33]. Future sex-specific genome-wide association studies that are powered to detect differential responses to macronutrients between men and women are needed.  Conclusions  It is possible that the genetic architecture for fat gain in response to high-fat diets is more complex in females than in males, and as such, the genetic component we are able to detect in our model contributes more to the overall response in males than in females.",bb92c245-1051-4042-b16d-047f6132a835
48,discussion11," The observation of these sex-specific quantitative trait loci (QTL)s for fat and lean mass gain at Fmgq2 and Lmgq1 and serum HDL cholesterol concentration at Hdlq2 and Hdlq3 highlights the importance of sex-specific analyses during the development of individualized dietary guidelines. We identified a known quantitative trait loci (QTL) at Hdlq1 for serum HDL cholesterol concentration that harbors Apoa2. Interestingly, the quantitative trait loci (QTL)s at Fmgq2 and Fmgq3 affect fat gain directly while Fmgq1 seems to influence fat gain directly as well as via an intermediate physiological change in serum cholesterol related to the strain-specific Apoa2 phenotypes. We have shown that genotypes at Fmgq2 alter the expression of Srd5a3 in a sex- and genotype-specific manner.",1abc9ffb-707d-4f22-a9b8-5f6acddd53ec
49,discussion12," It remains unclear if these loci explain the differential response to carbohydrate restriction we observed in the initial parent strain screen or if instead, they characterize the increased fat mass gain that we observe after the parental genomes are combined in hybrid and F2 populations. Further investigation of the candidate genes presented here will elucidate their roles in response to carbohydrate restriction in the parent, hybrid, and F2 populations.
