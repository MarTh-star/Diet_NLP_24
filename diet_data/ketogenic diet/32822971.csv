0,methods0," An online survey was developed using Microsoft Forms by a consensus group of ketogenic dietitians, as part of the Ketogenic Dietitians Research Network [Ketogenic Dietitians Research Network (KDRN)]. The survey link was circulated via email to Ketogenic Dietitians Research Network (KDRN) members working in 39 KD centres across the UK and Ireland. Data were requested only from members who were dietitians concerning patients currently following the KD for management of drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) only (excluding neurometabolic disorders). Data were collected between 3 June and 5 July 2019.",50b92b37-0f9d-4d54-a120-95aae07a1438
1,methods1,"  Dietitians were asked to categorise patients depending on feeding route, KD variant, and, if fed via a feeding tube (nasogastric, naso-jejunal, gastrostomy or jejunostomy), by type of ketogenic enteral feed (ketogenic enteral feed (KEF)) received and to give their best estimate (if the exact time was unknown or difficult to quantify) of the average number of hours (to the nearest whole hour) spent as an individual dietitian on a per-patient basis during the KD patient journey of pre-diet preparation, initial 3-month trial, 2-year follow-up period, follow-up beyond 2 years (if provided), and diet discontinuation. All patient-focused activity comprising direct patient contact and indirect patient activity, i.e., care contact time, as defined by the British Dietetic Association (British Dietetic Association (BDA)) [16], was to be included.",67eee2eb-a84d-4d6a-a681-cfe36b2897ec
2,methods2,"  Dietitians were invited to use free text to identify and describe specific factors that they considered impacted their time spent managing patients with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) on a KD, for example, certain patient and caregiver characteristics or the availability of support with patient-focused activity (direct and indirect) from dietetic colleagues and members of the KD multidisciplinary team (MDT). No patient data was requested.  Dietitians wishing to participate in the survey were advised to seek approval from the local research and audit team at their KD centre via email and retain for their records.  Data analysis was undertaken using Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, Version 2106 (Build 14131.20320 Click to run).  3. Results  3.1. Demographics  Responses were received from 15 dietitians representing nine UK-only National Health Service (National Health Service (NHS)) KD centres.",d301eb16-8d22-455e-8427-0f3cdf5701fd
3,methods3," Six (67%) provided a service to children only (aged 0–18 years), one (11%) solely to adults (aged 19 years plus), one (11%) to adolescents and adults (aged 13 years plus), and one (11%) to all age groups.  Data were obtained for 335 patients of which 267 (80%) were 18 years old or under. A total of 59% (198/335) took the KD orally, 36% (120/335) received a ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) via a feeding tube only, and 5% (17/335) used a combination of tube and oral feeding. A total of 56% (189/335) were on a classical KD (all children). Another 39% (130/335) followed the modified ketogenic diet (MKD) (67 children, 63 adults), and 5% (16/335) followed the MCT KD (8 children, 8 adults).  By stage of KD patient journey, out of 335 patients on the KD, 34 (10%) were in pre-diet preparation and 38 (11%) in an initial three-month trial. A total of 155 (46%) were within the two-year follow-up stage, and 89 (27%) had been followed up for more than two years.",dd370433-5b50-4314-91ba-9c30c1ff18cd
4,methods4," Nineteen (6%) were being discontinued from the diet.  3.2. Estimated Dietetic Care Contact Time per Feeding Route and KD Variant during the KD Patient Journey  For all feeding routes, KD variants, and ketogenic enteral feed (KEF)s (where applicable), a median of 162 h (IQR 54) of dietetic care contact time was spent per dietitian, per patient, during the KD patient journey (for a maximum of two years follow-up) (Table 1). Of this, a median of 48% (IQR 6) comprised direct patient contact (Table 2).  Patients following the classical KD via a combination of tube and oral feeding required the most dietetic care contact time during the KD patient journey (median 211 h, IQR 172), and those solely tube-fed a proprietary ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) required the least (median 85 h, IQR 61).",462fa73e-ab8f-4398-a85d-ba5bb01ffd3b
5,methods5," Median percentage time for direct patient contact was highest for those following the classical KD, modified ketogenic diet (MKD), and MCT KDs orally (50%, IQR 25) and lowest for patients on a classical KD given as a combination of tube and oral feeding (38%, IQR 25).  For orally fed patients, the classical KD was estimated to require the most dietetic care contact time per patient (median 193 h, IQR 213), followed by the modified ketogenic diet (MKD) (median 104 h, IQR 94) and MCT KD (median 95 h, IQR 82).  For KDs given as a ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) solely via a feeding tube, care contact time per patient per dietitian was highest for a blended food ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) (median 189 h, IQR 148) compared to those using a bespoke ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) (median 162 h, IQR 128) or proprietary ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) (median 85 h, IQR 61) during the KD patient journey.  3.3.",0c60f98c-1551-4039-afb2-630fd2bee419
6,methods6," Estimated Dietetic Care Time per Stage of KD Patient Journey for drug resistant epilepsy (DRE)  Median total estimated dietetic care contact time during each of the four stages of the KD patient journey (for a maximum of two years follow-up) for drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) categorised by feeding route, KD variant, and ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) type (if applicable) is shown in Figure 1.  During the pre-diet preparation stage, patients estimated as requiring the greatest amount of dietetic care contact time were those following either the classical KD blended food ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) (median 13 h, IQR 4), classical KD via combined tube and oral feeding (median 13 h, IQR 10), or the classical KD taken orally (median 13 h, IQR 8). Patients following an oral modified ketogenic diet (MKD) were estimated to need the least dietetic care contact time (median 4 h, IQR 9).",b33cf5d3-cec4-4b67-835f-2495794fe705
7,methods7,"  Throughout the three-month initial trial, the blended food ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) took the most care contact time (median 72 h, IQR 20), whilst the least was for those using a proprietary ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) (median 24 h, IQR 30) or a bespoke ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) (median 24 h, IQR 39).  For a maximum follow-up of two years, patients following the classical KD via combined tube and oral feeding were estimated to take the greatest amount of dietetic care contact time (median 144 h, IQR 120), whilst those on a classical KD proprietary ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) (median 48 h, IQR 36) and MCT KD (median 48 h, IQR 36) required the least.  Estimated dietetic contact care time for diet discontinuation and return to usual diet was greatest for a bespoke ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) (median 8 h, IQR 4) and blended food ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) (median 8 h, IQR 4). It was lowest for the modified ketogenic diet (MKD) (median 4 h, IQR 3).",80ce64c1-20bb-4146-9b67-aa74574defae
8,methods8,"  Of the 15 respondents, 12 (80%) had patients who had been following the KD for longer than two years. The estimated median care contact time for these patients was 2 h (IQR 2) per patient, per dietitian, per month.  Dietetic care contact time was estimated to be higher for all KDS per patient, per dietitian, per month during the three-month initial trial than during the two-year follow-up stage (Figure 2).  3.4. Impact of Specific Patient and Caregiver Characteristics on Dietetic Care Contact Time  Patients identified as needing additional care contact time (time not quantified in free text) were infants, toddlers, and young children, particularly during weaning and periods of rapid growth; adolescents and adults with learning difficulties, poor numeracy or literacy skills, or problems using email or the telephone; those with food allergies or intolerances, following self-restricted diets such as veganism,",c28e09aa-b304-48aa-9c48-404a36e28f91
9,methods9," or with poor tolerance of the KD on initiation; patients with complex medical conditions and co-morbidities; and those with multiple-agency involvement (including school, college, respite care facilities) or living in specialist accommodation.  Caregivers supporting patients with KD provision (for example, parents, relatives, or care staff) identified as increasing the dietetic care contact time needed per patient included individuals with learning and communication difficulties; non-English speakers and those with English as a second language, particularly if an interpreter was needed; those with health and mobility issues impacting their ability to cope with the practicalities of the KD, such as weighing and measuring of foods, and meal preparation; and individuals exhibiting challenging behavior or who were anxious and frequently seeking reassurance and those with health beliefs or dietary preferences not aligning with KD evidence-based practice.  3.5. Allocated vs.",d92c9f27-4ca7-4c68-a44d-2f7f37446d4f
10,methods10," Actual Dietetic Care Contact Time  In the UK National Health Service (NHS), one whole time equivalent (whole time equivalent (WTE)) dietitian is employed for 37.5 h per week [17]. A total of 445 h per week was officially allocated to the 15 respondents for the provision of KD services for 335 patients, equating to 11.85 whole time equivalent (WTE) dietitians with a mean of 28.3 (range 13.5–57.5) patients per whole time equivalent (WTE) dietitian.  Ten of fifteen (67%) respondents considered they had insufficient official working hours to fully undertake all patient-focused activity in conjunction with their requisite staff, service, and self-focused activities as defined by the British Dietetic Association (BDA) [16], which includes duties such as line management, student training, continuous professional and service development, and clinical governance. These dietitians reported spending an extra 4 to 13.75 h per week fulfilling all their job-related commitments.",877e18a0-6f23-4108-9865-4d00273011fc
11,methods11," However, the time involved fluctuated depending on patient and workplace demands, the latter often influenced by the need to provide holiday, sick, maternity, and study leave cover for dietetic colleagues as required.  Of the 15 respondents, 12 (80%) received help with patient-related tasks (including administration, training, and follow-up) from dietetic colleagues and members of the KD multidisciplinary team (MDT), such as a dietetic assistant or epilepsy-specialist nurse. Eight (53%) dietitians identified use of a ketogenic meal planner, such as the Electronic Ketogenic Manager (Electronic Ketogenic Manager (EKM)) [18], as a time-saver.  4. Discussion  Our survey showed that, in the UK, a median of 162 h of care contact time is estimated to be spent per dietitian, per patient with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) during the KD patient journey.",3f3f610e-a7e7-4b61-befb-6339af425042
12,methods12," Those following a classical KD taken orally as a combined tube and oral intake or as a blended food ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) were estimated as taking the greatest amount of dietetic care contact time. Two-thirds of survey respondents considered they had insufficient official working time to fully complete all their patient, staff, service, and self-focused dietetic activities. To our knowledge, no previous study has investigated dietetic care contact time in conjunction with consideration of the varied ways in which the KD is administered, albeit our results were estimated and obtained from a small number of survey participants.  Our estimated results are higher than stated in previous reports. MacCraken and Scalisi calculated that for the classical KD, dietetic time was approximately 16 h in total per patient, with diet duration ranging from 5 weeks to 2.75 years [10].",9923a847-93cb-4bec-be4f-22058ee9d046
13,methods13," Pre-admission appointments took an average of 55 min for tube-fed patients and 127 min for oral feeders, with inpatient admissions for diet initiation averaging 9 h (range 5.5 to 20). Outpatient follow-up, mostly via telephone, averaged 7 h. In comparison, Lord and Magrath’s UK survey estimated that implementation and monitoring of the classical KD took more than 50 h of dietetic time per patient [11]. Our data suggested that modified KDs require less dietetic time compared to the classical KD, in accordance with previous reports, although our estimations of required time are somewhat higher. Dietetic management of adult patients with glioblastoma receiving the modified ketogenic diet (MKD) in the UK has been reported to take 8.8 h (4 h non-clinical, 4.8 h clinical) per patient over a 12-week period [12]. In the USA, a minimum of 2.5 h of face-to-face dietetic contact time was needed for adults on a modified Atkins diet (MAD).",736c4df1-3347-4501-b375-83eb7206acc7
14,methods14," This included an individual enrollment appointment, group education session (1–1.5 h), and 0.5-h follow-up visits after three and six months and then annually, depending on diet duration [13]. Dietetic time needed for other patient-associated duties were not outlined. Kossoff and Dorwood [14] described initiation of the modified Atkins diet (MAD) in an outpatient setting with limited dietetic involvement and dietary education taking approximately 0.5–1 h.  Differences in estimations of dietetic care contact time spent, for any KD variant, will be influenced by the range of patients referred and the level of support they require. Country-specific dietetic practice and differences in medical service funding and resource availability may also impact estimations of time taken, as previous UK data are closer to our findings compared to those from the USA. In addition, differences may exist between the type of patient care contact that was examined, i.e.",a5224588-d3ff-415f-a804-658b3affab61
15,methods15,", direct, indirect, or combined, as this will have influenced the total amount of time reported. In addition, several studies have measured the time taken in hours prospectively [10,12,13,14], whereas our results are based on retrospective estimation. Therefore, direct comparisons between our findings and those of other authors may be problematic.  Our results suggest that certain KD variants and feeding routes are potentially more time and resource efficient than others. However, it is important to emphasize that KDs are highly individualised, which prohibits automatic allocation of specific diet prescriptions, standardised initiation protocols, and meal plans. In practice, choice of KD variant is guided not by time taken but by medical and nutritional need alongside the social circumstances, abilities, and preferences of patients and caregivers.",013fec36-a27f-44dd-9702-f8556cd676a2
16,methods16," For example, a more time-consuming bespoke or blended food ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) may be indicated rather than a proprietary ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) because of food allergies, intolerances, or to specifically meet individual nutritional requirements; a modified KD may be favoured for older children and adults for reasons of palatability and social acceptance rather than the requirement for less dietetic care contact time in comparison with the classical or MCT KD. KD variant selection may also be influenced by clinical evidence, particularly for younger children, where the classical KD has been found more effective than the modified Atkins diet (MAD) for patients aged 1–2 years [19].  Individuals with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) often have significant comorbidities, poor health-related quality of life, and specific socio-economic circumstances that conspire to make comprehending and undertaking KDs challenging both for themselves and their caregivers [20,21].",8d3622a6-2110-4a9e-8c6c-b05c2961b5bf
17,methods17," These factors may directly influence the amount of dietetic care contact time required and will account for high variability between patients, even for the same KD variant. Respondents to our survey identified certain patient and caregiver characteristics they considered necessitated more prolonged and intensive dietetic input leading to an increase in the duration and frequency of care contact time provided or demanded, although the estimated time involved was unquantified. Patient-focused activities described as taking longer were both direct (for example, training and education about the KD, responding to more frequent queries, giving extra reassurance, repetition of verbal instructions, and seeking clarification that information was understood and being followed correctly,",728c5047-eab9-4619-9ae5-0e21854f7fe1
18,methods18," especially if an interpreter was involved) and indirect (such as the preparation or adaptation of resources and support materials on an individual patient basis and the sourcing of new nutritional information for specialised food items). Adults and children with multiple-agency involvement required greater effort as, in addition to the immediate caregivers, training, support, and communication was essential to ensure wider health and social care networks were informed and involved. Conversely, once the KD was fully established, respondents indicated that dietetic care contact time was saved by training able patients or caregivers to use an online ketogenic meal planner, such as the Electronic Ketogenic Manager (EKM) [18].  Estimated dietetic time taken per patient will be impacted by the individual patient circumstances or underlying health or social needs and the experience level or individual practice style of the dietitian.",0adb78cf-a920-4cd8-99f9-508384a7082c
19,methods19," It could be assumed that more complex patients or less-experienced dietitians would have reported increased dietetic time, but as we did not collect this data, we cannot confirm this. In addition, external confounding factors are recognised as impacting healthcare service provision, such as facility location, setting, and population served and the skill mix and degree of support available from other members of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) [22]. Any one or more of these may have influenced our estimates of care contact time as well as how long the KD service had been established and operational for.  It is of concern that two-thirds of respondents considered they had insufficient official working time to fully undertake all patient-focused activity for their patients with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) on a KD in conjunction with requisite staff, service, and self-focused activities.",c4700a86-241d-4947-a559-3846f91eee68
20,methods20," This stretched working time may be exacerbated by some patients or caregivers deciding not to start the KD despite pre-diet preparation being completed by the dietitian or by individuals stopping the diet during or at the end of the three-month trial period due to no clinical improvement or the challenges involved in KD implementation; in these cases, the most time-intensive periods will have been undertaken by the dietitian but (usually) without benefit to the patient. It should also be noted that many KD services for drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) are built on the provision of a two-year KD follow-up period, and as such, patients remaining on diet for longer periods increase pressure on resources even if dietetic input needed for these long-term patients is less per month [9].  We fully acknowledge that this study has many limitations.",475cdf74-db8f-43f9-91ff-6c1e79a8c10e
21,methods21," Firstly, despite inviting all 39 KD centres in the UK and Ireland to participate, only 15 dietitians representing 9 UK National Health Service (NHS) KD centres completed the online survey. A previous questionnaire circulated amongst the Ketogenic Dietitians Research Network (KDRN) membership by Whiteley et al., 2020 [9], reported results from 39 KD centres across the UK and Ireland, although the total number of individuals who took part in their survey was not detailed by the authors. Self-selection bias may have influenced the decision to participate in the survey. We have no knowledge about certain characteristics of the fifteen dietitians that took part, as we did not ask for information concerning, for example, level of KD experience, workload, or how many of their patients or associated caregivers required a higher intensity of dietetic input and support.",a91f418a-42ba-4d70-8533-1a624ba6e50d
22,methods22," These factors may have also affected reported estimates of time taken for dietetic activities, but we are unable to account for this. Time was estimated retrospectively rather than by a formal prospective workload time analysis. This was a pragmatic approach chosen to place least demand on respondents. The survey was not validated, and therefore the estimates of time we obtained, although they add to the information available on this subject, cannot be relied upon for accuracy nor can they be generalised. Researcher imposition may have occurred given that the survey was designed by a consensus group of ketogenic dietitians. Our survey results are mostly related to paediatric patients, and any difference in time needed for management of children versus adults was not assessed.",1bd46200-c047-4a68-81e7-48edb34a2de7
23,methods23," We did not break down the dietetic care contact time needed by individuals following a KD for longer than two years by KD type, feeding mode, or ketogenic enteral feed (KEF) due to the varying lengths of time that individuals remain on diet. Time required for other healthcare professionals involved in the KD service, such as physicians and clinical nurse specialists, was also not evaluated. Finally, it may be difficult to extrapolate our UK National Health Service (NHS)-specific results to other countries.  5. Conclusions  Despite its many acknowledged limitations, our survey offers novel insight into the care contact time estimated to be required by dietitians in the UK to manage patients with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) following KDs considering the variety of modes in which they can be delivered.",2d24c7bc-6bf7-40bc-9adc-1a0f0bae4d91
24,methods24," Subject to careful interpretation and application due to the non-validity of the instrument used for data collection, potential bias from respondents, and data inaccuracy, our results may have application in the identification of inefficiencies in the delivery of patient-focused activities by dietitians during the KD patient journey. Further work could be undertaken to find ways in which the time involved could be reduced or capitalised upon without compromising patient care, for example, during the intensive initiation and three-month trial stages, or to inform the re-design of traditional care pathways for dietary management of drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) and to investigate the relationship between outcomes of patients on the ketogenic diet and dietetic care contact time.
