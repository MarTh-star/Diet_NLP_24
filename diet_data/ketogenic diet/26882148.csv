0,introduction0,"Hypobaric hypoxia is defined as a condition caused by the decreased partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere at high altitude, leading to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues. The brain is particularly sensitive to hypobaric hypoxia stress due to its high oxygen requirement. Moreover, in addition to structural alterations of the brain, high-altitude cerebral edema, neuroinflammation, motor impairment, memory impairment, etc. develop with exposure to hypobaric hypoxia [1, 2]. Regarding hypobaric hypoxia-induced memory impairment, an early report found that exposure to hypobaric hypoxia above 4700 m resulted in serious adverse changes in behavior performance, especially learning and memory [3]. Pagani et al. found that a significant impairment of spatial memory in mountaineers has been reported at altitudes greater than 5350 m for more than 15 days [4].",2293e1c1-97be-4eb4-82a6-9b6e883746d6
1,introduction1," Based on animal models and biochemical screens, these cognitive deficits may be attributed to several molecular mechanisms, such as oxidative stress, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, altered ion channels, etc. Accordingly, antagonizing these signaling pathways plays a preventive role in ameliorating the impaired memory function [5]. Since hypobaric hypoxia exposure produces a complex and comprehensive stress on the brain, targeting a single pathway usually produces inadequate neuroprotection with limited efficacy. The development of new interventions is in urgent need.  Ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat with low-carbohydrate diet, has been an effective treatment of intractable epilepsy in children for decades. Increasing evidence shows that KD also has a positive impact on cognition and behavior in various neurological disorders [6]. For example, Ijff et al.",c171050e-0c7b-429b-8e09-6af5e357a5f3
2,introduction2," found that the KD exerts a positive impact on behavior and cognitive functioning in children and adolescents with refractory epilepsy [7]. In a rat epilepsy model kindled with pentylenetetrazol, KD not only attenuated the decrease in the exploration ratio in both the new object recognition and novel placement recognition task but also had a protective effect on spatial memory in the Morris water maze [8]. Although increasing evidence that the KD enhances cognitive function in both pathophysiological and normal healthy experimental animal systems [9,10], the exact mechanism of action by which the KD exerts these effects has not been fully understood. Previous studies have focused on its property of tissue energy transition and anti-oxidative damage.",af918abe-4a85-4342-8aa2-4a30cb6f0ab2
3,introduction3," However, the recent findings that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the main ketone body of KD metabolism, is an endogenous and specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase (histone deacetylase (HDAC)) provide new insights into the understanding of KD activity [11]. It is suggested that the cognition-improving effect of the KD might be related to increased histone acetylation modification.  In addition to activation of the Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway, hypoxia also provokes different epigenetic mechanisms involved in gene expression [12]. A recent report found that hypobaric hypoxia has differential effects on acetylation of proteins in the neocortex and hippocampus of the rat brain and that the predominant targets for this acetylation appear to be histones [13]. Reversing the decrease in histone acetylation may be an effective method to relieve injuries caused by hypobaric hypoxia.",c2e328ce-0fc3-44b9-8f65-acf6df0e9d5b
4,introduction4," We proposed that KD may improve cognitive dysfunction caused by hypobaric hypoxia through modification of histone acetylation. In the present study, we found that KD administration not only enhances spatial learning in adult rats but also reverses the spatial memory impairment caused by hypobaric hypoxia. Moreover, the decrease in histone acetylation induced by hypoxia was reversed by KD treatment. These findings indicate that a KD can protect against memory impairment caused by exposure to hypobaric hypoxia. ",09904f26-1737-417d-b01f-67dcb4dd6e61

33,discussion2," These results strongly support the hypothesis that BHB-mediated acetylation modification plays a crucial role in the memory-improving effect induced by KD. This notion was also supported by clinical trials involving patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment [21]. An orally administered mixture of medium chain triglycerides was reported to improve memory and attention in these individuals, and better performance was associated with higher plasma BHB levels.  brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is considered as the most prevalent neurotrophic factor in the brain, responsible for neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity et al. Acute and chronic hypoxia have been reported to decrease the levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Anti-hypoxia treatment can increases the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in these regions [22, 23].",164e7790-ccd7-4691-af06-11e388e312e6
34,discussion3," Activation of the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway may be involved in the hypoxia-insult protection. More importantly, it is also reported that the decreased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be involved in cognitive impairment during acute high altitude hypoxia in human volunteers [24]. In the present study, we found that the decreased levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein are restored by KD pre-treatment, which is accompanied by increased levels of acetylated histone H3 and H4 in the hippocampus. Moreover, The results of ChIP-PCR showed that there is increased acetylated histone H3 binding to promoter I of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene. Since KD is ketogenic and BHB is known serves as histone deacetylase (HDAC)s inhibitor, BHB is probably the executor via its histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibiting activity to specifically induce brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression.",1e6e808d-f754-4c66-8a31-f0e3c41e05b0
35,discussion4," This propose is efficiently supported by a newly published report that both exercise-induced BHB and exogenous injected BHB specifically increases brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promoter I activity in the hippocampus of mice, which is accompanied by inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC)2 and histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 activity [25]. Therefore, KD restores memory-related gene expression through the enhancement of histone acetylation at gene promoters.  It is well known that epigenetics, especially histone acetylation, play crucial roles in the cellular response to hypoxia. Histone acetylation is necessary for the protection of brain function from injury through remodeling of chromatin structure and, consequently, gene expression [26]. The results of the western blot in our study showed that the reversal of the decreased histone acetylation provided a foundation for KD treatment to protect the brain from hypoxia-induced memory impairment.",fa15dfdb-028c-4d90-9232-6d42fa959afd
36,discussion5," This notion is also supported by a new published report that severe hypobaric hypoxia (equivalent to an altitude of 11 km) caused global repression of the acetylation process in the neocortex and hippocampus in 3–24 h [13]. It has also been found that up-regulation of histone acetylation by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor treatment improved long term memory performances in several hippocampal-dependent paradigms, such as contextual fear conditioning [27], Morris water maze [28], and object location [29]. Moreover, in addition to rescuing cognitive impairment resulting from neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors also have great potential to serve as cognitive enhancers for the cognitively healthy. Administration of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA or NaB resulted in enhanced contextual fear memory performance in mice and improved spatial memory on the water maze task, respectively, [30].",67afec59-e9cd-4f70-9f48-674869440b09
37,discussion6," Therefore, targeting dysregulated histone acetylation is a promising strategy to modulate memory functions in various neural disorders, including hypobaric hypoxia-induced memory impairment.  In combination with previous findings, our data provide new evidence that there is a promising application for the KD in improving cognition of neural disorders resulted from hypoxia injury. Evidence supporting this proposal comes from findings that ketosis, whether induced by a KD or by administration of BHB, plays a protecting role in various models. For example, administration of 4 mM Na-BHB, a concentration observed in mild ketosis, has been reported to enhance the survival of primary cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to hypoxia in serum-free media by decreasing apoptotic damage [31].",8fbd03ed-b5cd-45f0-a16a-ca177db42445
38,discussion7," In the organotypic hippocampal culture model, exogenous ketone administration of BHB not only preserved neuronal integrity and stability but also protected cells from the metabolic and excitotoxic insults and reduced post-hypoxic hyperexcitability [32,33]. Oral KD or intraventricular-infused BHB also resulted in a significant reduction in infarct volume following MCAO in rats [34]. Taken together, these data suggest that a KD might be a strong candidate for treatment of neural disorders resulting from hypoxia injury. Since the clinical safety of a KD has already been verified, it would be interesting to determine the preventive effects of a KD on high mountain disease in volunteers at a high-altitude plateau.  Although more studies are necessary to fully define the fundamental mechanisms of KD-induced cognitive enhancement, the present data may offer valuable clues towards a better understanding of a KD in the improvement of cognitive disorder.",2757b331-a5cf-4e4b-825e-c40b4c1b4cff
39,discussion8," Our results also lay the foundation for future research by identifying the critical improvement in synaptic plasticity, the molecular basis of cognitive flexibility. As our knowledge of KD as an effective intervention for cognitive disorders continues to expand, future research aimed at exploring the impact of a KD on cognition deterioration when reaching a high-altitude plateau is of great clinical significance. =",e80a964a-936e-4423-a28e-233892a4506e
