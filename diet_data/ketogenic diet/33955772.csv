0,abstract0," Elevating blood ketones may enhance exercise capacity and modulate adaptations to exercise training; however, these effects may depend on whether hyperketonemia is induced endogenously through dietary carbohydrate restriction, or exogenously through ketone supplementation. To determine this, we compared the effects of endogenously‐ and exogenously‐induced hyperketonemia on exercise capacity and adaptation. Trained endurance athletes undertook 6 days of laboratory based cycling (“race”) whilst following either: a carbohydrate‐rich control diet (n = 7; carbohydrate (CHO)); a carbohydrate‐rich diet + ketone drink four‐times daily (n = 7; Ex Ket); or a ketogenic diet (n = 7; End Ket). Exercise capacity was measured daily, and adaptations in exercise metabolism, exercise physiology and postprandial insulin sensitivity (via an oral glucose tolerance test) were measured before and after dietary interventions.",d0582d9e-1a64-4bca-9c07-efafd1f522a3
1,abstract1," Urinary β‐hydroxybutyrate increased by ⁓150‐fold and ⁓650‐fold versus carbohydrate (CHO) with Ex Ket and End Ket, respectively. Exercise capacity was increased versus pre‐intervention by ~5% on race day 1 with carbohydrate (CHO) (p < 0.05), by 6%–8% on days 1, 4, and 6 (all p < 0.05) with Ex Ket and decreased by 48%–57% on all race days (all p > 0.05) with End Ket. There was an ⁓3‐fold increase in fat oxidation from pre‐ to post‐intervention (p < 0.05) with End Ket and increased perceived exercise exertion (p < 0.05). No changes in exercise substrate metabolism occurred with Ex Ket, but participants had blunted postprandial insulin sensitivity (p < 0.05).

Physiological Reports, 10 , e15309. 10.14814/phy2.15309 ==== Body pmc1 INTRODUCTION  To sustain contractile activity for extended periods, exercising skeletal muscle must rapidly resynthesize ATP through substrate‐level and oxidative phosphorylation (Hargreaves & Spriet, 2020).",d6597acb-42e8-4c35-8241-d4f2f049457d
3,abstract3," The relative contribution to ATP resynthesis from skeletal muscles’ primary fuels, fat, and carbohydrate (carbohydrate (CHO)), is largely dependent on the intensity of exercise undertaken . At moderate‐high exercise intensities (~ >70% peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak)), glucose‐6‐phosphate from intramuscular glycogen catabolism represents the major fuel . Dependence on this relatively small energy depot is unsustainable during prolonged (~ >1 h) exercise (Pernow & Saltin, 1971).  When sufficiently elevated, the ketone bodies—β‐hydroxybutyrate (βHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc)—may provide a supplementary oxidative substrate for skeletal muscle (Balasse & Fery, 1989). Given this, it is hypothesized that inducing hyperketonemia may enhance exercise capacity by reducing muscles reliance on carbohydrate (CHO) .",552a77c7-54b2-4f41-8aa9-8dc772c09293
4,abstract4," However, the estimated contribution of ketone oxidation to overall energy expenditure during exercise varies widely from 0% to 18% (Balasse & Fery, 1989; Cox et al., 2016; Dearlove et al., 2021; Dearlove et al., 2021; Wahren et al., 1975), meaning the utility of this substrate is debated . Ketones also have a range of metabolic signaling effects (Newman & Verdin, 2017), including altering the availability and utilization of carbohydrate and fat, which could acutely modulate exercise capacity and alter adaptative responses to exercise training . However, these effects may depend on whether hyperketonemia is induced endogenously or exogenously.  Blood ketone levels may be increased through severe restriction of dietary carbohydrate (CHO) . With prolonged fasting, plasma βHB concentrations increase to ⁓1.5–2.5 mM within ~3 days and reach a physiological plateau of ⁓6 mM after 5–6 weeks (Robinson & Williamson, 1980).",f73578ff-9b9d-45c0-b48b-5928800207b0
5,abstract5," Ketogenesis may also be induced through a very‐low‐carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet, with βHB levels achieved dependent on the degree of carbohydrate (CHO) restriction (Noakes & Windt, 2016). Although the effects of a ketogenic diet on acute endurance exercise performance are equivocal, (Burke, 2021) exercise training undertaken during severe carbohydrate (CHO) restriction augments potentially favorable molecular adaptations that increase maximal fat oxidation rates (Burke, 2021). However, this adaptive response is not thought to result from hyperketonemia, but rather the metabolic milieu required to induced ketogenesis (Cox & Clarke, 2014).  Alternatively, blood βHB levels may be elevated exogenously through the consumption of ketone esters. Here, blood ketone levels rise rapidly and transiently in a dose‐dependent fashion , without the need for dietary carbohydrate (CHO) restriction.",1ee9e037-2cb0-4370-b3f6-834edc02c3bd
6,abstract6," The combination of hyperketonemia with replete carbohydrate (CHO) stores may enhance acute endurance exercise capacity , although both null (Dearlove et al., 2019; Evans & Egan, 2018; Evans et al., 2019; Poffé et al., 2020) and negative effects  have also been reported. Moreover, prolonged supplementation of ketones during high‐intensity exercise training may prevent the deleterious effects of overreaching , and has been hypothesized to influence the adaptive response to exercise training .  The comparative effects of these hyperketotic states on exercise capacity and adaptation has not been determined. Accordingly, we recruited 21 trained endurance athletes to an exercise study where exercise capacity and physiological/metabolic adaptation in response to a carbohydrate control diet, a carbohydrate‐rich diet supplemented with ketones, and a ketogenic diet was determined.  2 ",118c0b0d-9d70-4c8d-9f1f-17d2c01665f9

11,methods4,"1 carbohydrate (CHO)  As current nutritional guidelines advocate a high‐carbohydrate (CHO) diet to support endurance exercise performance and training , we included a carbohydrate (CHO) control group. Participants maintained a habitual macronutrient composition diet, supplemented with drinks containing a weight‐adjusted amount of dextrose, an artificial sweetener (Neotame NutraSweet), and a bitter additive (product code: 648352, Symrise). Four study drinks were consumed daily (Figure 1).  2.2.2 Ex Ket  Participants maintained a habitual macronutrient composition diet, supplemented with drinks containing a weight‐adjusted amount of D‐βHB monoester (D‐β‐hydroxybutyrate‐R 1,3‐butanediol monoester; TdeltaS), dextrose, and an artificial sweetener (Neotame NutraSweet). Based on internal piloting, we predicted this would elevate blood βHB levels for ~10 h (see Supplementary information 2).  2.2.",0335d8b3-d2c9-4dde-a587-834c028049c9
12,methods5,"3 End Ket  To induce ketogenesis, the target dietary macronutrient composition was ~5% energy from carbohydrate (CHO), ~80% energy from fat, and ~15% energy from protein (Noakes & Windt, 2016) (e.g., diet diary in Supplementary Information 3). Participants were given a weight‐adjusted lipid containing drink (Calogen, Nutrica HCP).  Compliance was determined through diet diaries, and in the End Ket group (non‐blinded) only, also through the measurement of pre‐breakfast capillary blood βHB concentrations using a portable monitor (Freestyle Optium Neo). βHB concentrations in 24‐h urine collections were used to determine compliance with study drink consumption in Ex Ket. Several participants reported missing one or more of their 24‐h urine collections. For this reason, urine data is reported as a ratio versus the carbohydrate (CHO) group, rather than absolute values.  2.",30f49074-3e59-4cf6-b4d3-fa577c52ad5a
13,methods6,"3 VO2 peak test  Following enrolment, subjects completed an incremental‐intensity exercise test on an electronically braked cycling ergometer (Ergoselect 100) to determine power at VO2 peak, as described previously . Briefly, tests began at 100 W and increased 25 W every 3 min until volitional fatigue with continuous measurements of pulmonary gases.  VO2 peak was defined as the highest 20 s average for volume of oxygen consumed per min (VO2) during the test. Power attained at VO2 peak was recorded and used to set fixed power outputs for the subsequent laboratory cycling (% of VO2 peak). Maximal power (WMax) was calculated as previously reported .  2.4 6‐day laboratory cycling  To assess exercise performance, participants undertook six days of laboratory exercise (‘race’; Figure 1). Participants were instructed to perform no additional exercise during this time.",ff771643-aff1-44d6-8b16-af0bad3af70e
14,methods7," Participants were permitted self‐selected pre‐race meals (finished no later than 1 h before attending the laboratory). Once at the laboratory, the only energy consumed was from study drinks. The exercise consisted of 90 min at 70% VO2 peak on an electronically braked cycling ergometer (Ergoselect 100). Following a 10 min break, participants undertook an incremental exercise test to fatigue. This began at 75% VO2 peak and increased 5% every 5 min until volitional fatigue or inability to hold a cadence ≥60 revolutions per min (revolutions per min (RPM)).  2.5 Fasted exercise tests  Pre‐ and post‐intervention, participants attended the laboratory after an overnight fast for measurements of exercise metabolism and physiology (Figure 1). Body weight was measured using calibrated scales (BF508, Omron, Japan) and skin‐caliper measurements were taken at seven sites to quantify body composition (Harpenden Skinfold Caliper).",32126a0e-99ad-45f1-91b2-ec31c864b1f1
15,methods8," A catheter was inserted into an antecubital vein of the arm and a fasted blood sample was drawn. Resting respiratory gases (via indirect calorimetry) and heart rate were recorded. A muscle biopsy was performed on the vastus lateralis using methods previously described . After a subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsy was performed (see Supplementary Information 4), participants commenced exercise. No study drinks were administered before or during exercise, so that pre‐ versus post‐intervention differences in exercise physiology/ metabolism may be attributed to the dietary intervention. The exercise protocol was identical to that employed for the exercise intervention (90 min steady state at 70% VO2 peak followed by an incremental exercise test to volitional fatigue). Blood was drawn, respiratory gases and heart rates were measured, and perceived exertion was recorded at t = 30 min, 60 min, and 90 min during steady‐state exercise.  2.",e9ad2fb7-dc48-4787-b12d-37bf4e62bd2f

Study drinks were consumed on rest days.  2.8 Cardiorespiratory measurements  Indirect calorimetry was used to determine the volume of carbon dioxide expelled per min (VCO2), VO2, respiratory exchange ratio (respiratory exchange ratio (RER)), and expired minute volume (VE). Participants wore a snug, comfortable fitting face mask (Hans Rudolph) attached to a calibrated indirect calorimeter (Metalyzer 3BR2, Cortex Biophysik) for the continuous sampling of respiratory gases, displayed in real‐time using Metasoft (v7.9.1, Cortex Biophysik).",a2055b2c-ff83-4bba-b5f2-e79d0e860037

Following the completion of measurements, cardiorespiratory data were time‐averaged (5 s) in MetaSoft and exported to a.CSV file for further analysis.  2.9 Calculations of carbohydrate and fat oxidation rates and gross efficiency  Energy expenditure and fat and carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation rates were calculated from VCO2 and VO2 values using the non‐protein exercise‐intensity dependent calculations of Jeukendrup & Wallis (2005). To allow direct comparison with other studies, calculations were not corrected to account for the effects of ketogenesis and ketolysis, and thus include a small systematic error (Frayn, 1983).  2.",67a4bbe6-de7b-460c-ba0e-fcec258ba520

Participants attended the laboratory having fasted overnight. A catheter was inserted into an antecubital vein of the arm and a baseline blood sample was taken. Participants then consumed a drink containing 75 g dextrose in 400 mL water. Blood samples were taken at t = 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min while the participant rested.

For these participants, respiratory gases were sampled using a Douglas bag immediately prior to blood draws. Participants breathed into a mouthpiece containing a one‐way valve, connected to a 50 L Douglas bag.

41,discussion0,"  Hyperketonemia may enhance physical capacity and modulate adaptive responses to exercise training (Burke, 2021; Evans et al., 2017). To determine if this depends on how hyperketonemia is induced, we compared the effects of a ketogenic diet (End Ket) and ketone supplementation (Ex Ket) on exercise capacity and physiological/ metabolic adaptation to an 11‐day dietary intervention. We found that exercise performance versus a pre‐intervention test was significantly increased on 50% of race days with Ex Ket, but markedly impaired on all race days with End Ket. End Ket caused a pronounced increase in fat oxidation during exercise, whereas Ex Ket caused a blunting of postprandial insulin sensitivity. Adaptive responses to exercise may have been diminished with both Ex Ket and End Ket versus carbohydrate (CHO).",b6b07733-fdf5-4a9b-bb7e-7dabe64d461b
42,discussion1,"  Consistent with previous reports (Burke, 2021), exercise capacity was significantly decreased with End Ket, both versus the pre‐intervention fasted exercise test and relative to Ex Ket and carbohydrate (CHO) conditions. Additionally, athletes that adopted a ketogenic diet experienced greater perceived exertion during exercise and overall mood disturbance, as measured by the daily analysis of life demands of athletes (DALDA) questionnaire. The 11‐day dietary intervention was arguably too short to induce cellular adaptations required to support exercise at intensities >70% VO2 peak whilst primarily utilizing fat . Indeed, only skeletal muscle PDK4 content—an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase and, therefore, an important regulator of glycolytic flux  ‐ was increased with End Ket. However, fat oxidation rates were ~1.",c949c9f1-785f-4e21-a5af-0a6e6885a8d1

This suggests fat oxidation rates may have already reached physiological limits with End Ket. One participant improved exercise capacity at the post‐ versus pre‐intervention fasted exercise test with End Ket, whereas all other participants were markedly worse. This athlete had a lower fasted blood βHB concentration (peak 1.7 mM vs. 4.0 mM group mean), which based on self‐reported macronutrient intakes and fasting non‐esterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels (the precursor for hepatic ketogenesis; 0.6 mM vs. 0.7 mM group mean), was not due to non‐compliance. Notably, fat oxidation rates at the post‐intervention fasted exercise test were lower for this individual (0.8 g·min−1 vs. 1.",6da43a6c-5642-403f-9842-1e944040d8a1
44,discussion3,"2 g·min−1 group mean), potentially suggesting an increased capacity for glycogen synthesis from non‐glucose precursors, thus providing substrate for glycolysis. The erogenicity of supplementing athletes with ketones with or without carbohydrate (CHO) co‐ingestion versus isocaloric carbohydrate (CHO) remains equivocal (Cox et al., 2016; Dearlove et al., 2019; Evans & Egan, 2018; Evans et al., 2019; Leckey et al., 2017; Poffé et al., 2020, 2021). The change in exercise capacity (daily time to exhaustion during ‘race’ vs. time to exhaustion at the pre‐intervention fasted exercise test) was consistently higher with Ex Ket versus carbohydrate (CHO); however, this 3‐condition study may have been underpowered to test the statistical significance of this comparatively small difference, particularly considering the substantial variation introduced by the marked decrease in exercise capacity with End Ket.",adfdaf75-c38c-4ab2-84cf-b7d0d934f4e8
45,discussion4," Indeed, an exploratory analysis of only Ex Ket and carbohydrate (CHO) data showed a significant increase in exercise capacity with Ex Ket.  A broad goal of endurance exercise training is to increase oxidative capacity, which necessitates enhancing the ability of the cardiovascular system to deliver oxygen and substrates to skeletal muscle (central component) and skeletal muscles’ ability to oxidize substrates (peripheral component) . In response to endurance exercise training, skeletal muscle increases its capacity to oxidize fat and has enhanced metabolic flexibility (Egan & Zierath, 2013)—that is, an increased ability to switch its proportional utilization of fat and carbohydrate depending upon their availability and/ or environmental conditions (Goodpaster & Sparks, 2017). Adaptive responses to endurance exercise in the present study diverged across dietary interventions. HR at 70% VO2 peak was significantly suppressed with carbohydrate (CHO) and Ex Ket.",c1b093b8-ded6-485c-bb53-8e0dac78c58d
46,discussion5," This could represent increased cardiorespiratory system efficiency (functional adaptation) or parasympathetic overtraining (non‐functional adaptation) (Budgett, 1990). In support of the former, mood disturbance (daily analysis of life demands of athletes (DALDA) questionnaire) and exercise capacity did not deteriorate. Alternatively, the high carbohydrate (CHO) intake may have decreased urinary sodium and chloride excretion, leading to an expansion in plasma volume . In turn, this may cause a lower heart rate for a given exercise intensity . VO2, VE, energy expenditure, and perceived exertion were decreased during 70% VO2 peak exercise from pre‐ to post‐intervention with carbohydrate (CHO) only, which may represent an advantageous cardiorespiratory and muscular adaptation in response to the high‐carbohydrate (CHO) diet.",a2bf606a-af8a-46a8-87ba-4ee34302b583
47,discussion6," The observed blunted adaptive response to a ketogenic diet versus carbohydrate (CHO) is consistent with previous reports in elite race walkers (Burke et al., 2017, 2020). Given the growing list of ketone signaling effects on human physiology and metabolism (Newman & Verdin, 2017), it is plausible that ketone supplementation (Ex Ket) may have blunted adaptive responses versus carbohydrate (CHO). However, further work would be required to determine this.  Consistent with a potentially deleterious adaptive response to ketone supplementation, postprandial insulin sensitivity was blunted with Ex Ket. Notably, participants did not consume ketones immediately before/during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)s and, therefore, the reduced insulin sensitivity must have been an adaptive response, rather than an acute effect of hyperketonemia.",e7e29176-3c3f-492c-acfd-30ab6fcca814
48,discussion7," This is supported by in vitro work demonstrating that prolonged, but not acute, incubation of cardiomyocytes and mouse soleus muscle in βHB causes reduced glucose uptake . The mechanism for the reduced insulin sensitivity with Ex Ket is unclear. We hypothesized that changes in adipocyte function may have contributed. Prolonged niacin infusion induces transcriptional changes in the cAMP signaling pathway within adipocytes, which may contribute to the insulin resistance observed with prolonged niacin treatment . βHB has a similar signaling effect on the cAMP signaling pathway in adipocytes . However, we found no changes in cAMP, lipolytic or SLC2A4 (GLUT4) gene expression with Ex Ket. Calorie intake during race tended to be increased compared with participants habitual intake with Ex Ket only (~700 Kcal increase with Ex Ket).",b9391020-05bf-4c2e-87a4-645150286cb7
49,discussion8," This finding is consistent with previous work reporting dietary intake in free‐living individuals supplemented with the same ketone ester during endurance exercise training , but is contrary to reports that acute exogenous ketone supplementation suppresses appetite . Short‐term energy surplus may impair glucose tolerance  and thus, the relative increase in calorie consumption with Ex Ket could, in part, explain the decrease in insulin sensitivity. However, the effects of energy surplus on glucose tolerance are reversed when concomitant daily vigorous‐intensity exercise is performed , as with the present study. Whilst the mechanism for the reduced insulin sensitivity is unclear, within the context of starvation‐induced ketosis the rational for why ketones may impair insulin‐stimulated glucose disposal is logical.",bde4620a-a11e-44bf-ad30-809e9f8b8b18
50,discussion9," This action would reduce glucose uptake in insulin‐sensitive tissues—most notably, skeletal muscle—preserving this vital metabolic substrate for the brain during environmental conditions of reduced carbohydrate (CHO) availability.  Our study is not without limitations. To ensure the study drinks were isocaloric, we supplied carbohydrate (CHO) at a rate of 1.4 g min−1 in the carbohydrate (CHO) group, rather than the gold‐standard 2.0 g min−1 . Moreover, we did not supply multiple‐transportable carbohydrate (CHO)s as per gold‐standard recommendations . It is possible that exercise performance with Ex Ket and carbohydrate (CHO) would have been the same, or even favor carbohydrate (CHO), had we followed these guidelines. An important explanation for observed decreases in exercise capacity following a low‐ or very‐low‐carbohydrate (CHO) diet is the depletion of intramuscular glycogen.",566474a2-31fb-436d-8ad4-77d3b7e7c761
51,discussion10," To prioritize muscle samples for proteomic analysis, we did not measure the effects of the dietary interventions on intramuscular glycogen content and, therefore, cannot comment on this. However, the decrease in blood glucose during exercise and rapid weight loss (~60% of total weight loss within 1 day of commencing the diet) with End Ket might suggest glycogen was depleted. Only one female completed the study, who was randomized to Ex Ket. It would be useful to determine whether sexual‐dimorphism effects performance and adaptive responses to dietary interventions. Finaly, participants volunteered for End Ket, rather than being randomized to it, which may have introduced a selection bias. However, participants reported habitually consuming a carbohydrate (CHO)‐rich diet and no baseline characteristic differences were noted versus participants in carbohydrate (CHO) and Ex Ket.  5 ",a056da12-0f7c-4190-83a6-4f8e12fd7530
