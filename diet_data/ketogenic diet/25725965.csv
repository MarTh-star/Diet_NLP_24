0,background0,"The term “ketogenic diet” (KD) generally describes any diet under which the serum levels of the ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acetoacetate (AcAc) and acetone increase beyond their reference ranges, typically 0.3 mmol/l for BHB, the most abundant circulating ketone body. This state of “ketosis” is a physiological condition for humans also occurring naturally in neonates, during intermittent and longer-term fasting or after intense exercise without glucose replacement [1]. To achieve the state of “nutritional ketosis”, a KD is usually composed of a very low carbohydrate (carbohydrate (CHO)) and high fat content and may additionally be combined with calorie restriction.  In recent years, the number of expert reviews concluding that KDs possess promising effects for cancer patients has sharply increased [2–10].",2850ecb8-a344-4008-84fc-d2658baacee5
1,background1," Specifically, it has been proposed that ketone bodies would confer protection to normal cells during radio- or chemotherapy while being non-protective or even toxic to tumor cells [6]. In addition, a high fat diet with ample protein intake may be ideally suited to meet the metabolic demands of the cancer patient whose metabolism is often affected by the tumor in such a way that peripheral tissues become more carbohydrate (CHO) “intolerant” while relying more on fatty acid oxidation [10]. However, clinical research on the effects of KDs in cancer patients is still scarce. There are some concerns against using KDs in cancer patients due to the side-effects that can occur. These include deficiencies in micronutrients, appetite loss, nausea, constipation, fatigue, hyperlipidemia and—especially relevant for cancer patients weight loss [11].",3b34cd24-03c0-45a5-82c6-27647766bb81
2,background2," Some of these side-effects, however, may be attributable to the transition phase in which the body has to adapt to the high fat and low carbohydrate (CHO) content of the diet, usually one to 3 weeks. Other, longer-term side-effects may be preventable by restricting the KD to the timeframe of (RT)/radiochemotherapy (restricting the KD to the timeframe of (RT)/radiochemotherapy (RCT)) since there is evidence that it is most useful as a supportive intervention in this context [6]. We have therefore started to collect data on ambulatory patients consuming a KD during RT, and here report our initial clinical experience with the first six of such patients within a busy community hospital environment. Our main aim was to assess the feasibility of such an intervention and track body composition changes during the combined KD-RT treatment; secondary outcome variables included biochemical blood parameters and quality of life (QoL).",209a53dc-cadf-4446-a984-8f71570b094b

Data collection was performed on the first six consecutive patients undertaking a KD during RT/restricting the KD to the timeframe of (RT)/radiochemotherapy (RCT) in our clinic. In most cases patients already had initiated or wished to initiate the diet at the initial consultation with the treating radiation oncologist. In one case (patient 2) we recommended the diet during restricting the KD to the timeframe of (RT)/radiochemotherapy (RCT) in an attempt to stop continuing weight loss. All patients were told, however, of the limited clinical experience with this diet in the context of cancer treatment and informed about potential side effects such as headaches, light-headedness, constipation/diarrhea and weight loss.",d8ac63fa-5dda-4748-871d-168c51a3d77a

At study entry, all patients gave written informed consent to collect and publish their data. In particular, all patients agreed that their data could be used for scientific purposes such as publication in a scientific journal. Besides the KD and QoL assessment none of the interventions were unusual for a patient undergoing restricting the KD to the timeframe of (RT)/radiochemotherapy (RCT) in our clinic. All these procedures were performed according to the ethical standards of the declaration of Helsinki and approved by an institutional review board.",d49c8fcb-0663-48f9-82f6-f7c003603160
6,methods2,"  Body composition Body weight and composition were assessed at study entry and in regular intervals thereafter (the aim was once per week) through bioimpedance analysis (bioimpedance analysis (BIA)) on a seca 515/514 medical body composition analyzer (mBCA; seca Deutschland, Hamburg, Germany). The mBCA device has a standing platform with an integrated scale and a handrail system, with one pair of electrodes for each hand and foot (eight-electrode bioimpedance analysis (BIA)). A current of 100 μA and a total of 19 frequencies between 1 and 1000 kHz are used to obtain impedance measurements. Instrumental precision is specified as 100 g for BW between 50 and 200 kg and 5 Ω for impedance of the left and right half of the body.",1b5a2485-e21c-4e10-ace5-4c43d12e66fd

In order to minimize systematic errors, patients were always measured fasted and without having drunk for at least 10 h. Patients were also asked to void their bladder prior to each measurement. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, body height was measured to within the closest 5 mm with a seca 231 stadiometer before the patient stepped onto the mBCA platform and placed feet and hands on the corresponding electrodes.",77fe875f-3933-4227-9f4b-67373d221314

The PA is of special interest for oncological and other critically ill patients, as small PA values have been shown to predict a poor prognosis [13, 14].  Blood parameters In all patients except patient 5, blood draws were performed at study entry, once during RT and in the week of treatment termination.",24faf1e3-419d-4df5-b0d3-7dd23b3c7a6d
9,methods5," Parameters of interest included a complete blood count as well as HDL and LDL cholesterol, BHB, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and thyroid stimulating hormone (thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)). In patient 5 blood test results were requested from the hospital where the patient underwent chemotherapy. Starting with the fourth patient, we also used occasional finger-pricktests with a FreeStyle Precision device (Abbott Diabetes Care Ltd., Range Road, Witney, UK) in order to determine BHB and blood glucose concentrations.  Ketogenic diets Due to the limitations imposed by the ambulatory setting in our clinic, all KDs were self-administered with counselling at least once per week. Patients received short handouts providing basic information on KDs such as main foods to eat and avoid as well as sample menus. For more detailed information we also lent and recommended to buy a popular book on KDs for cancer patients [15].",8a3e0070-9b83-4438-afa2-28089be7640a
10,methods6," In general we recommended to restrict carbohydrate (CHO) intake to <50 g/day and emphasized the intake of olive oil, coconut oil, butter, ghee, and fatty fish, cheese, meat and non-starchy vegetables. To monitor ketosis, patients were provided with urine strips (Ketostix®, Bayer Consumer Care AG, Basel, Switzerland) and a diary for protocolling their measurements, preferably done in the afternoon. Patients were also asked to record the quantity of all foods eaten for at least 2 days in order to determine their actual energy and macronutrient intake.  Questionnaires QoL was assessed using the EORTC QLC-C30 questionnaire version 3.0 together with its disease-specific modules [16].

While the small sample size, short duration of follow-up and lack of a control group are obvious limitations for the interpretation of our results the strength of our data is that patients were followed prospectively and many measurements of clinical relevance were made. A main result is that the KD intervention within the context of a busy community hospital setting was feasible, but posed some challenges, the main one being patient compliance which is hard to control within an ambulatory setting. From our experience with the six cases presented here we have learned that three measures would help to maximize compliance and high ketosis: (1) frequent individual counselling by a dietician experienced with KDs; (2) provision of ketogenic formulas and meals; (3) offering cooking classes.",90c23e24-4b76-456f-95a9-cf453da20948
30,discussion1," These three steps have now been implemented in our clinic for the care of future patients who wish to undertake a KD during RT.  Importantly, no diet-related side effects occurred in our patients who finished RT without breaks and rated their subjective feeling on the diet as “good”. Furthermore no negative effects on blood parameters were detectable, contradicting the account of some authors who describe the KD as unhealthy or even dangerous. It is likely that limiting the duration of a KD to a short timeframe such as the period of RT limits any negative impact on blood parameters. Weight loss could be a concern, however, although in our study this has to be interpreted within the context of restricting the KD to the timeframe of (RT)/radiochemotherapy (RCT) that by itself can lead to BW loss of a similar magnitude as observed in our patients [19].",8e634992-e7d8-4638-b7de-768295f61878
31,discussion2," While theoretically a KD has both appetite stimulating and appetite suppressing mechanisms, the interaction of these mechanisms as well as the common experience in humans speaks more for an overall anorexigenic effect [20], consistent with the reports of our patients.  Our bioimpedance analysis (BIA) data indicate that weight loss was mainly due to FM loss during the diet phase. PA was also basically unaltered with the exceptions of patient 5 who had extensive disease with a rapidly growing tumor and the steep decrease of PA at the final measurement in patient 4 that remains open for interpretation. PA is an important measure of overall health, muscularity and nutritional status on the cellular level [21] and it is not uncommon for PA to decrease during RT [19].  While a decrease in FM can even be rated as beneficial for some patients [22] there is strong evidence that skeletal muscle mass is the crucial component for long-term prognosis and QoL [23].",6fc4eac1-8f83-48df-953d-dc8c5139a8ef
32,discussion3," It would be ideal for a diet of cancer patients to both counteract protein catabolism and stimulate protein anabolism. The KD might be such a “cancer-specific diet” [10]. Regarding catabolism, studies have shown that ketosis decreases urinary nitrogen losses and muscle mass breakdown in both healthy individuals [24] and undernourished cancer patients [25]. Regarding anabolism it should be considered that different protein sources differ in their net nitrogen utilization (net nitrogen utilization (NNU)), i.e., the percentage of amino acids that—after digestion—get utilized in the anabolic pathway to build new body protein without energy production or nitrogen loss [26]. Proteins with lower net nitrogen utilization (NNU) provide a larger percentage of amino acids that get deaminated in the catabolic pathway, delivering more precursors for endogenous glucose production via gluconeogenesis as well as nitrogen catabolites that have to be detoxified by the liver.",78069a70-ef21-4da4-b9a6-33829a10f7a5
33,discussion4," For this reason we advised our patients to consume high quality proteins such as fish and eggs and began substituting them with MAP which has been shown to have a net nitrogen utilization (NNU) of 99 % when used as the sole protein source in healthy individuals [26].  Focussing on high quality protein makes particular sense in the context of a KD where the ketosis-repressing properties of dietary protein have long been known. The classic KD used for treating intractable epilepsy in children has therefore been based on calorie restriction and a ketogenic ratio of at least 3:1 in order to maximize ketosis and its therapeutic efficacy [27], with the downside of severe protein restriction. The ketogenic ratio in our patients ranged from approximately 1:1–2:1 (but probably higher due to not reporting of cooking fats and dressings) which allowed for ample protein intake and good tolerability, but might have been too low to considerably elevate BHB concentrations in some patients.",e39cc9c9-6990-48c4-b84c-88fbad3bada0
34,discussion5," Our experiments with patient 5 suggest that ketogenic drinks, especially enriched with medium chain triglycerides, provide an easy way to transiently increase the ketone to blood glucose ratio.  Given the large variety of human tumors and the fact that most cancer patients are old and/or present with weight loss, sarcopenia, diabetes and other metabolic comorbidities (including those induced by their tumor) it is presently unclear what the ideal ketogenic ratio for an individual cancer patient is. Thomas Seyfried’s group has emphasized the importance of maximizing the ketone to blood glucose ratio [28].",4b1e3542-c25f-4b54-b3e9-9758b52687c6
35,discussion6," Can we achieve a good compromise between maximally lowering this ratio and providing sufficiently high protein and energy intake in order to maintain important muscle tissue? Can we also implement additional calorie restriction in certain patients to enhance efficacy without a negative impact on body composition as indicated by one case report [29]? These questions must be addressed with human data. For our part, the initial observations reported here motivated us to initiate a randomized study on the feasibility and effects of a KD intervention on body composition, blood parameters and QoL. The protocol of this study called KETOCOMP (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02516501) is provided in a companion article [30].  Conclusions We presented a variety of prospectively collected measurements on the first six consecutive patients that undertook a KD during RT treatment in our clinic within a busy community hospital.",db897e73-2002-4651-9740-e1ced368e47f
36,discussion7," No serious diet-related side effects occurred, and subjective feeling on the diet was rated as good. Ketosis was not as pronounced as it is usually reported for protein- or calorically restricted KDs, and blood sugar levels did not decrease significantly. This might indicate problems with either compliance or prescribed diet composition which is discussed within the context of the ideal diet composition for cancer patients aiming at the preservation of muscle mass. Importantly, although significant weight loss occurred in some patients, our bioimpedance analysis (BIA) data indicate that weight loss was mainly due to fat mass loss. From these observations we implemented additional measures of diet counselling and initiated a randomized study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02516501) the protocol of which is published in a companion paper [30].",ccb2025a-45d4-4b29-9216-622dbdaccde7
