3,methods3,"  Dietary intervention  Participants followed a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD), known as Nic's Ketogenic Diet, for 140 days. The diet provided 5% calories from carbohydrates, 70% from fat, and 25% from protein. Daily calorie needs were assessed by a Registered Dietitian (RD) using the Harris–Benedict equation to calculate basal energy expenditure which adjusts for age, height, weight, gender, and activity level.27 This estimate was then multiplied by 0.9 to calculate 90% of their energy requirements for weight maintenance.  Detailed dietary information to participants is provided in Supplementary File S1. Sweeteners, all fruits with the exception of berries, starchy vegetables, low-fat dairy products, soy, grains, beans, and alcohol were to be avoided.

Ketogenic diets for weight loss have been gaining popularity3 with the typical ratio of fats to carbohydrates and proteins ranging from 3:1 to 4:14; the goal being to induce “physiological ketosis” marked by increases in blood ketone levels.5  One concern with such diets is their conflict with globally accepted dietary guidelines advocating a high-carbohydrate, low-fat dietary pattern.",fa03707b-3ef5-4bc3-8cf8-186570dc8d87

A significant 12.8% increase in HDL-C is clinically relevant as a 1% increase in HDL-C is associated with a 2%–3% reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.46 The 0.23 mmol/L TG reduction together with HDL-C changes may have stronger implications for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk as they are associated with LDL-C phenotype. At Day 140, all participants had a lipid profile suggesting a nonatherogenic phenotype A.

Calorie reduction and substantial weight loss may have confounded the changes in cardiometabolic markers, including HDL-C, TG, HbA1c, and SBP, in this study. Maximum weight loss with a ketogenic diet has been proposed to be achieved by 6 months with improvement of cardiometabolic markers continuing up to 24 months.52 It is possible that with longer study duration, improvements in HbA1c, lipid profile, and BP observed in the current study may have continued, after the weight loss period had subsided.",4bc0e5c0-239e-49ba-93cd-a83bbf91275c
25,discussion6," Future studies should explore the efficacy of very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) over a period up to 2 years to examine the effect on cardiometabolic markers independent of weight loss.  There have been few longer term studies examining ketogenic diets among obese participants,24,55 with similar limitations of open-label design and lacking a control group. While the findings of this study suggest beneficial changes in cardiometabolic outcomes, the potential detrimental effects of a long-term very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) need to be recognized.

Future studies should also examine the adjustments that are made after a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and return to habitual diet as this has not been previously examined.  Conclusion  This open-label study demonstrated that 140 days of a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD), known as Nic's Ketogenic Diet, significantly reduced body fat, weight, body mass index (BMI), SBP, and HbA1c and increased muscle mass in healthy participants with mildly elevated LDL-C levels.",f0437059-5819-4a9b-960f-15e91223357c
27,discussion8," Significant increases in TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C were observed after 140 days which may have been driven by a variety of factors, including diet, genetics, and weight loss. This diet was found to be safe as assessed by AEs, clinical chemistry, hematology, heart rate, and electrocardiogram (ECG). The beneficial changes in body composition and clinically relevant changes in cardiometabolic markers suggest that very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) could possibly be used as a strategy to mitigate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, these findings need to be explored in future randomized clinical trials.
