0,methods0," Pure strain male NMRI mice (age 12-15 weeks) were purchased from Banting and Kingman (Hull, UK) and were fed rat and mouse breeding diet (Pilsbury, Birmingham, UK) and water ad libitum. The standard diet contained 50% carbohydrate and supplied 11.5% of the energy as fat. Fragments of the MAC16 tumour were implanted into the flank by means of a trocar as described  and were given free access to rat and mouse breeding diet after transplantation until weight loss occurred, when they were randomised as described below. Blood was removed using a heparised syringe by cardiac puncture from animals under anaesthesia with a mixture of halothane, oxygen and nitrous oxide without subsequent survival. Plasma was prepared by centrifuging whole blood in a Beckman microfuge for 30 s. Isophane insulin was supplied by Evans Medical Ltd (Greenford, Middlesex, UK).",05a13e8c-dd4a-4312-b9e6-42865de19ad6
1,methods1,"  Insulin administration  When the tumours became palpable and the animals started to lose weight (14-21 days after transplantation) they were randomised into six groups, five of which continued to receive the rat and mouse breeding diet and water ad libitum. One group served as control and was injected s.c. in the leg daily with 200 /tl of 0.9% NaCl. A second group was injected daily with 15 U insulin kg-I day-I and two groups were injected daily with 20 U insulin kg- 1 day- 1. All insulin injections were administered in a volume of 200 jMI of 0.9% NaCl between 10 and 11 a.m. for an 8-day period. One of the groups receiving 20 U insulin kg- 1 day- 1 was given sodium D(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate in the drinking water at a concentration of 30 p mol ml -1 and another group received D(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate alone. The average daily water consumption for all groups did not differ significantly and is indicated in Table I.",fddabecd-efdc-4e2f-89ba-38378ef473c3
2,methods2,"  A fifth group of animals received a diet which was isonitrogenous and isocaloric to the rat and mouse breeding diet, and which supplied 80% of the calories as medium chain triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) and was supplemented with rodent 006 premix . This diet was formulated as a paste to minimise food scatter. All food was supplied ad libitum. Two control groups of non-tumour-bearing animals of the same body weight received daily injections of either 0.9% NaCl or 20 U insulin kg -I day- . Body weights and food and water intake were measured daily during the course  Br. J. Cancer (I 989), 59, 677-681  678   S.A. BECK & M.J.",f2e9fe95-bb01-4983-a169-4f4bb3338268

Ammonia, urea and creatinine in urine were analysed quantitatively using Sigma diagnostic kits (Sigma Chemical Co., Dorset, UK).  Body composition analysis  Each carcass was placed in an oven at 80?C until constant weight was reached. Carcasses were then reweighed and the total fat content was determined by the method of Lundholm et al. (1980). The residue was the non-fat mass. The thigh plus gastrocnemius muscle dry weights were also determined. ",af7115bd-10f9-41d9-a6c8-151e74fdbe7f

6,results0," The effect of daily insulin injection on the food intake, degree of weight loss and tumour weight in male NMRI mice bearing the MAC16 adenocarcinoma is shown in Table I. Non-tumour-bearing animals injected with insulin at the maximum   concentration  of 20 U kg 1 day-1  had  no significant alteration in either food intake or body weight gain when compared with animals injected with 0.9% NaCl alone. Animals bearing the MAC16 tumour had a highly significant decrease in body weight when treated with 0.9% NaCl alone without an alteration in food or water intake, and this weight loss was significantly reduced either by feeding a diet in which 80% of the calories were supplied as medium chain triglyceride (MCT) or by insulin injection (20 U kg 1 day- 1), with or without supplementation with D(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate in the drinking water.",5455d536-cc54-44e8-9bdb-1abeb988554b
7,results1," Prevention of weight loss in animals fed either an 80% medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet or administered insulin occurred without a significant alteration in food consumption (Table I), determined by analysis of variance. The extent of weight loss with lower concentrations of insulin (15 U kg- day-1) was not significantly different from controls. The prevention of weight loss by the 80% medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet was associated with a significant reduction in tumour weight, while in animals administered 20 U insulin kg- 1 day- 1 the tumour weight was 50% greater than in tumour-bearing animals administered 0.9% NaCl (P<0.05). This stimulation of tumour growth rate by insulin was counteracted by the inclusion of D(-)-3hydroxybutyrate in the drinking water without any effect on the extent of weight loss. Animals administered 3-hydroxybutyrate alone had a weight loss and tumour growth rate similar to those administered 0.9% NaCl.",2a2a9493-8332-4a0e-9ded-ece30e98b429

9,results3,"  The plasma level of metabolites in each of the dietary groups is shown in Table III. As previously reported  mice bearing the MAC16 tumour have a significantly reduced blood glucose level and the hypoglycaemia is maintained in animals administered insulin. Plasma levels of Free fatty acid (FFA), which are reduced in tumour-bearing animals, are not altered by insulin, but are elevated in animals fed the 80% medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet or given supplementary 3-hydroxybutyrate. Plasma levels of acetoacetate or 3-hydroxybutyrate are not elevated in tumour-bearing animals fed the normal diet despite the large depletion of carcass fat (Table II). While insulin alone had no effect on the plasma levels of acetoacetate or 3-hydroxybutyrate, the inclusion of 3-hydroxybutyrate in the drinking water, or changing the diet to 80% medium chain triglyceride (MCT), caused a significant elevation in the plasma levels of both ketone bodies.",d20ebd83-670f-47fe-92a4-7cdd41012f08
10,results4,"  The effect of dietary modification and insulin injection on the nitrogen balance and urinary nitrogen excretion is shown in Table IV. Nitrogen excretion in the faeces is not significantly different in animals bearing the MAC16 tumour from that in non-tumour-bearing animals. Animals bearing the MAC16 tumour had a similar nitrogen input but a significantly greater nitrogen output than non-tumour-bearing controls. The major contribution to the nitrogen output was urinary urea, which was significantly elevated in tumourbearing animals fed a normal diet, suggesting an increased gluconeogenesis from amino acids. Tumour-bearing animals fed an 80% medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet had a nitrogen intake which was not significantly different from those fed a normal diet, but the nitrogen output was significantly reduced such that the nitrogen balance was not significantly different from that of  non-tumour-bearing controls.",169df1fe-194b-42ad-a195-fd0c2865f92c
11,results5," Urinary urea excretion was also significantly reduced in tumour-bearing animals fed the 80% medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet suggesting a reduction in gluconeogenesis from amino acids. Although the total nitrogen output was significantly reduced in tumour-bearing animals administered 20 U insulin kg- 1 day- 1, and the urinary urea excretion was significantly reduced from tumour-bearing animals administered 0.9%, the nitrogen balance was not significantly elevated above saline infused controls. Urinary ammonia levels were significantly elevated only in animals given sodium 3hydroxybutyrate in their drinking water due to the excretion of  keto  acids  in  the   urine  (total  concentration 0.23mg24h1)h ",926d1f64-dcce-4d89-a5fc-8e5d22133eb6
12,discussion0," Plasma levels of immunoreactive insulin have been reported to be decreased and glucagon increased in tumour-bearing animals  and insulin administration has been reported to decrease host catabolism while not stimulating tumour growth . In fact a number of tumours have been reported to grow faster in diabetic animals (Hissin & Hilf, 1978; Sauer & Dauchy, 1987). However, insulin is a known stimulator of cell growth and in high concentration is a vital component for the growth of cells in serum-free medium (Barnes & Sato, 1980). Like many other growth factors the insulin receptor has tyrosine phosphokinase activity and undergoes autophosphorylation (Cobb & Rosen, 1984). In this study we have compared the ability of insulin injection, with or without D(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate supplementation to prevent host weight loss and to conserve lean body tissue without stimulating tumour growth rate.",c083f545-8ff9-4ff0-9f5f-b09ae0796763

Insulin administered daily at a concentration of 20 U kg 1 has been shown to be as effective as a ketogenic diet in the prevention of weight loss induced by the MAC16 tumour. However, whereas an 80% medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet leads to a significant reduction in tumour weight, insulin causes an enhanced tumour growth rate.",ad202306-9cc0-4e0e-b314-72d9ef99adb4
14,discussion5," The stimulatory effect of insulin on tumour growth is abolished by the continuous administration of sodium D(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate in the drinking water suggesting that 3-hydroxybutyrate has the ability to block the insulin mediated stimulation of tumour growth since 3-hydroxybutyrate alone has no effect on either weight loss or tumour growth. The anticachectic effect of insulin and a ketogenic diet is mediated without an increase in food consumption and animals bearing the MAC16 tumour show weight loss without a reduction in food intake, suggesting that anorexia is not responsible for weight loss in this model system . Previous workers have demonstrated a potent anticachectic effect of exogenous insulin which was attributed to a stimulation of food intake and occurred without an effect on tumour growth , although recent work suggests an increased tumour weight in insulin treated animals .",7adbb374-7d07-4be7-af9b-3afec0900c85
15,discussion6," However, insulin has the capacity to increase substrate availability, which may be important in the insulin induced growth stimulation. Certainly blood glucose levels are somewhat lower in the presence of insulin.  Both the carcass fat and the thigh and gastrocnemius muscle mass are preserved to some extent in MAC 16 tumour-bearing animals administered either insulin or an 80% medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet. Both insulin and 3-hydroxybutyrate inhibit lipase activation in adipose tissue (Bjorntorp, 1966) and insulin has been shown to stimulate protein synthesis and inhibit protein degradation in isolated rat diaphragm  and to reduce the conversion of alanine to glucose in the liver . An increased level of gluconeogenesis has been observed in cachectic cancer patients and may contribute to the weight loss (Gold, 1974).",7507ec99-8c06-47af-bb7e-1ac7ca0031d6
16,discussion7," The mechanism by which insulin and 3-hydroxybutyrate reduce the tumour-produced lipopolytic and proteolytic activity (Beck & Tisdale, 1987) remains unresolved, but may be related to their function in normal metabolism.  Increased muscle proteolysis in cachectic animals is evidenced by an increased urinary output of nitrogen metabolites, without an alteration of nitrogen input, resulting in a less positive nitrogen balance. Animals fed the 80% medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet have a reduction in total nitrogen output, without an effect on nitrogen input, raising the nitrogen balance to that of non-tumour-bearing controls, while the nitrogen balance in animals administered insulin is not different from saline infused controls despite a significant reduction in urea excretion.  We have recently shown that a ketogenic diet is capable of inducing significant weight gain in severely cachectic patients .",189bd0e5-332e-46d1-b1a1-bf8c7f293c45
17,discussion8," While no information on tumour growth rate was available from this clinical study we have previously shown that a similar diet fed to mice bearing a cachexia-inducing tumour was capable of preventing weight loss and at the same time reducing tumour burden . In this comparison with an 80% medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet as anticachectic therapy insulin produced not only an accelerated growth rate, but also occasional unexpected deaths, presumably due to hypoglycaemia. Moley et al. (1985) also reported a shortened survival of tumour-bearing animals receiving long-term insulin therapy, and thus patients would have to be closely monitored to avoid hypoglycaemic death.  Thus the potential for stimulation of tumour growth and possible toxicity would make insulin less suitable than a ketogenic diet as anticachectic therapy.  The authors would like to thank Mr M. Wynter for the tumour transplantation.",631cdbbf-44e5-4da8-b912-033ee2c14053
