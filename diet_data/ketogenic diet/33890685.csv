5,methods5," Elegibility Criteria  The PECOS framework, as aforementioned, was followed to determine which studies were included in the present systematic review. Each study had to meet the following inclusion criteria: (i) studies that test the effectiveness of fasting on athletes’ performance; (ii) articles should be randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or uncontrolled clinical trials; (iii) human studies published fewer than 7years ago. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) studies with subjects with pathologies and (ii) the language of the articles was not English or Spanish.  2.4. Study Selection  All studies identified by the search strategy were screened using the eligibility criteria that were specified previously. The first stage of assessment involved the screening of titles and abstracts by two reviewers (JJPM and MCV). The same reviewers undertook the second stage, screening the full text.",ca85994c-665b-4149-bf62-730f9bed1616
6,methods6," In cases of disagreement, a decision was made by consensus or, when necessary, a third reviewer (SNL) was consulted.  2.5. Data Extraction  Two independent reviewers (JJPM and MCC) who were blinded to each other extracted the following relevant data from each study: study details (first author, year of publication), characteristics of participants, setting, pain condition, SE measuring instrument, outcome measures, duration of follow-up, and study design. If there was any discrepancy between reviewers, a third reviewer was consulted (SNL).  2.6. Assessment of Methodological Quality  The evaluation of the methodological quality of the chosen studies was carried out by means of the PEDro scale translated into Spanish [29].",95dc422a-5b95-4e73-8a87-22849a19c937
7,methods7," The scale scores 11 items: specified eligibility criteria, random allocation, concealed allocation, similarity at baseline, subject blinding, therapist blinding, assessor blinding, >85% follow up for at least one key outcome, intention-to-treat analysis, between-group statistical comparison for at least one key outcome, and point and variability measures for at least one key outcome. The methodological criteria were classified as follows: if the criterion is met, it obtains 1 point, and if not, 0 points. The first item of the PEDro scale does not count in the score of methodological quality; hence, it was eliminated from the tables to avoid confusion. The PEDro Scale is recognized as a valid measure of the methodological quality of clinical trials due to the findings supporting its use in this category of trials [30].",aeccfa6c-169a-4764-b8d2-e67015088e93
8,methods8," The “Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields”(QUALSYT) checklist was used for the quality assessment of non-randomized trials. The scale is made up of 14 criteria that can be answered by four options: Yes, No, Partial and N/A. These items assess whether: the question or objective is sufficiently described, the design is evident and appropriate to answer the study question, the method of subject selection is described and appropriate, the subjects are sufficiently described, if random allocation to treatment group was possible, it is described, if interventional and blinding of investigators to intervention was possible, it is reported, if interventional and blinding of subjects to intervention were possible, it is reported, the outcome and means of assessment are reported, the sample size is appropriate, the analysis is described and appropriate, some estimate of variance is reported,",89c5f55b-bb5e-4f8a-8d4d-5406b831f207
9,methods9," it is controlled for confounding variables, the results are reported in sufficient detail and the results support the conclusions. The maximum obtainable score is 1. The final score is calculated as follows: Total sum = (number of “Yes” × 2) + (number of “Partial” × 1); Possible sum = 28 − (number of “N/A × 2); Final score: total sum/possible sum = ≤1.  To increase the methodological quality of the systematic review, the internal validity of each study was measured by the PEDro Internal Validity Scale(Internal Validity Scale (IVS)) [29]. Seven internal validity criteria were collected from the PEDro scale.",420b3ac9-7055-4f09-a299-50cabaeb5a2b
10,methods10," Criteria 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 were selected to form the Internal Validity Scale (IVS) and must be classified as follows: Articles with an Internal Validity Scale (IVS) between 6 and 7 are considered to have a high methodological quality; articles with an Internal Validity Scale (IVS) between 4 and 5 are considered to have an average methodological quality; articles with an Internal Validity Scale (IVS) between 0 and 3 are considered to have a low methodological quality.  3. Results  3.1. Characteristics of the Selected Studies  3.1.1. Study Characteristics  A total of 32,232 citations were identified through electronic databases. The number of studies retrieved from each database and the number of studies excluded in each screening phase are shown in Figure 1. A final number of 21 studies satisfied our inclusion criteria and were included in this review.",237c9ca3-98f5-46f7-89ee-2d051dadc9f3
11,methods11," Of these 21 studies,14 are randomized controlled trials [25,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43] and 7 are non-randomized trials [24,44,45,46,47,48,49], with a total of 407 participants who satisfied our inclusion criteria and were included in this review. There are 24 race walkers, 76 cyclist, 21 sprinters, 143 performed resistance training, 12 overload training, 8 runners and 127 participants who did not specify their physical activity.  3.1.2. Methodological Quality  The degree to which studies met the quality criteria varied considerably. The methodological quality assessment of all included studies is presented in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5. Characteristics of the selected studies are shown in Table 6.  Seven studies, in addition to being evaluated on the PEDro scale, were also measured on the QUALSYT since they were non-randomized controlled clinical studies.",53f09875-40ea-4e39-bc6b-f69d8c1b1f4d
12,methods12,"  The characteristics of the intervention and the results of the studies chosen for the review are shown as follows.  3.2. Intermittent Fasting  The main differences found between fasting and non-fasting groups were related to physical performance, concentration of glucagon-like-peptide-1, phosphorylation and levels of some proteins related to autophagy (presented LC3I, LC3II and p62 proteins), plasmatic glucose and consumed calories. No differences were found between groups when comparing the systemic concentration levels of the energy-regulating hormones [32].  It is of great importance to specify the results obtained in each kind of exercise given the differences found between them when they are being performed, such as energy production methods and energy distribution, when focusing on aerobic or anaerobic predominance.  In this regard, sprinters decreased speed when they fasted for 14 h per day over a period of 3 days.",ad26da45-31a1-4d0b-9fc3-434e46b55b46
13,methods13," However, their glucose levels remained stable after training and were higher than those of HDLc and free fatty acids [44]. The concentration of glucagon-like-peptide-1 in the non-fasting group was higher than the fasting group [32].  In endurance sports, the phosphorylation and levels of some proteins related to autophagy have been seen to be higher when fasting for 36 h when compared to untrained subjects [45].  Specific isometric contraction has been measured in sport populations after practicing Ramadan. The levels of voluntary activation and voluntary maximum isometric contraction showed a decrease during the first week of Ramadan, measured by the neuromuscular efficiency and the potential for contraction at rest [46].  Anaerobic and high-intensity performance has been shown to be decreased by assessment with the Wingate and cycling tests after fasting [31].",caabf600-ba1c-4bdb-8ad1-3dbb51943ba1
14,methods14,"  Finally, fasting before exercise could regulate blood glucose levels, leading to a metabolic shift, which increases fat metabolism and decreases fat storage after a reduction in the total caloric intake [33,50].  3.3. Time Restricted Feeding  The mean differences between the TRF groups and the non TRF groups were related to strength, resistance, healthy cardiometabolic markers, decreased body fat, decreased levels of testosterone and insulin growth factor type 1 (IGF-1), increased levels of adiponectin, weight loss, improvements in body composition and an increase in peak power output/bodyweight, and a reduction in white blood cells that usually appear after intense sports. There were no differences in muscle mass loss, hypertrophy, lean mass, muscle measurement in centimeters nor total cholesterol or triglycerides.",18d51de7-395f-4984-b159-9b1d5c5f2e86
15,methods15,"  Cyclists have been shown to improve body composition and an increase in peak power output/bodyweight (Peak power output (PPO)/Body weight) when compared to controls after using TRF intervention [39]. Furthermore, cyclists have shown to improve high intensity aerobic endurance using this nutritional strategy [41].  Strength has been shown to increase after TRF intervention, measured by bench press 1-RM and hip sled 1-RM [35].  Resistance has been shown to increase after TRF intervention, measured by bench press endurance and hip sled endurance [35].  Anaerobic capacity in sprint runners increased in healthy runners when compared to adult runners after a TRF intervention [34].  Health status has been shown to be improved after a TRF intervention, specifically in biomarkers such as blood pressure and increased adiponectin and HDLc, as well as body fat and cardiometabolic markers [37].  3.4.",10bb5021-33bb-4e06-8549-538df02b9c4c
16,methods16," Ketogenic Diet  The mean differences between the KD groups and the non-KD groups were related to salivary immunoglobulin A, decreased strength and endurance, decreased stamina, reduction in fat mass and visceral adipose tissue, increased insulin level, an increase in fat metabolism after intense exercise, reduction in body weight by decreasing the fat content and a decrease in muscle damage after exercise. There were no differences between groups when comparing blood pH, concentrations of lactate in the blood and the levels of bicarbonate, VO2max, grip strength and testosterone level.  Resistance trainers have been shown not to improve strength after using a KD intervention when compared to controls [25]. Furthermore, resistance trainers have been shown not to improve endurance after using a KD intervention when compared to controls [25,47].",c2e2b80a-f8c3-46ca-86f2-02b67ec23e1e
17,methods17," On the other hand, endurance athletes have reported an improvement in their well-being, easier recovery and benefits in the health of their skin and a reduction in inflammation after using a KD intervention [49].  With regard to muscle strength and hormone profile in male resistance trainers, no significant differences have been found when compared to controls [43].  Cyclists have presented a decrease in the performance of high-intensity exercises, evidenced by a low concentration of lactate after using a KD strategy [48].  4. Discussion  The objective of this study is to evaluate the existing evidence on different nutritional strategies in the improvement of the quality of life and performance of the athlete. This review shows that IF and TRF improve the health of the athletes. In terms of performance, there is still controversy in the current research.",5954038b-a898-4726-a89c-8101579066f0
18,methods18," Aerobic performance, such as resistance or endurance training, seems to be decreased by IF, TRF and KD in the short term, but benefits from nutritional strategies in the long term. Moreover, athletes performing aerobic exercises described an increased well-being, easier recovery, benefits in the health of their skin and a reduction in inflammation after using the KD strategy. Anaerobic exercise, such as strength training, measured by bench press, leg press, lat pull downs and sprints, seem to be increased when using a TRF strategy and decreased when using a KD in the short term. Nevertheless, both strategies may be useful in the long term.  4.1. Intermittent Fasting  Physical performance was observed to deteriorate during the first days of the transition period from a usual diet to intermittent fasting in four studies [31,41,44,46]. However, a recovery of performance in the last days of intervention was recognized in two studies [31,41].",fa948a75-237e-4d1c-a90c-5c0d2300e5e8
19,methods19," In addition, one study [46] explained that intermittent fasting increased the levels of depression, anxiety and fatigue during the first week; hence, the negative effects of IF, which occur at the beginning of this diet, are due to the change in diet. Therefore, a study with longer intervention time may clarify the lack of understanding of intermittent fasting´s effects in the long term.  In the research by Cheriff A et al. [44] and Bin Naharudin MN et al. [31], blood glucose levels were found to remain stable after exercise in fasting subjects. Cheriff A et al. [44] indicate an increase in free fatty acids in blood, while Bin Naharudin MN et al. [31] confirm a decrease in blood triglycerides levels. Thus, a decomposition of triglycerides is observed to create free fatty acids as a source of energy, which causes a decrease in body mass, as explained by Dethlefsen MM et al. [45], without the need to break down muscle tissue.  Dethlefsen MM et al.",05835c74-dc89-40a3-a082-b44719472a94
20,methods20," [45] verified the effects of 36 h of fasting and stated that the levels of phosphorylation and LC3I, LC3II and p62 proteins, related to autophagy, were lower in the non-sports group. In the trained group, autophagy was expected to start between 12 and 24 h after fasting. However, beclin1 was required to start the process, indicating that there were autophagy markers in the blood but not enough to initiate the process in the sports group, which suggests that a 36 h fast may serve to regulate skeletal musculature autophagy in subjects who perform sports. Furthermore, Edinburgh et al. [33] showed that exercise during fasting decreased plasmatic glucose levels by modulating them when compared to controls that carried out exercise after having breakfast.",5b501f33-62fb-4384-8d68-f29766b22794
21,methods21,"  Three main theories have been suggested to explain the benefits of IF on improving metabolic effects, such as better insulin sensitivity, and on metabolic markers, such as systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, fat mass and triglycerides, even in eucaloric conditions: (i) the Ketosis theory, (ii) oxidative stress hypothesis and (iii) the circadian rhythm hypothesis [19]. The first is widely known for its postulated mechanism of metabolic shift, which increases fat metabolism and decreases fat storage after a reduction in total calorie intake. The second focuses on mitochondrial metabolism, which decreases the cellular inflammatory process. The third is thought to affect our internal 24 h circadian rhythm at both a central and peripheral cellular level when altering the timing of food intake. These theories open new possibilities to plan the specific moment to use a nutritional strategy based on a specific goal.",51d1ee42-be54-4b25-b4b5-41b5e07e2a01
22,methods22," In the performance of athletes, this may be to increase insulin sensitivity or to improve energy metabolism based on the moment of the match or training. However, there is little evidence in this regard and more studies are needed to propose optimal IF protocols for athletes [50].  4.2. Time-Restricted Feeding  The TRF has managed to equal [36,38] and even surpass [35,39] the improvements in strength and endurance of the control group by carrying out different diets, but with similar caloric content. This shows that that TRF does not decrease sports performance and can be practiced by athletes without fear of losing performance. Gasmin et al. [34] showed that the use of two days per week of TRF for 3 months increased the level of red and white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit and neutrophiles in young athletes when compared to old athletes, which suggests that the efficacy of this nutritional strategy may be related to age.",2831d664-6cbe-41d8-b82f-4cac0cc4fac4
23,methods23,"  With regard to the development of muscle mass, Grant M et al. explains that although there was no decrease in it, the control group achieved a significant increase compared to the intervened group [35]. On the other hand, Grant M et al. and Moro T et al. stated that there was no significant difference in the improvements of the groups [36,38]. The differences between the studies most likely lie in the intervention times, the exercises performed during the intervention and the range of hours in which the subjects were fed. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is no decrease in muscle mass when practicing such a diet.  There was a significant reduction in terms of body fat in the intervened group in three studies [37,38,39]. Hence, the maintenance of lean body mass and decreasing fat could be considered a good method to control body weight.",46c9e686-5adb-4d99-ba9d-551eeb7273d2
24,methods24,"  As regards endocrine effects, it should be noted that in the three aforementioned studies adiponectin was observed, which accompanies an improvement in insulin affinity [37,38,39]. Both Moro T et al. and Moro T et al. reflected a decrease in testosterone and IGF-1 levels after exercising in the intervened group [38,39]. However, Moro T et al. indicated that white blood cell levels decreased significantly less in the TRF group than in the control group after intense exercise [39].  McAllister MJ et al. indicates a reduction in blood pressure and increased HDLc in the intervened group [37]. On the other hand, Moro T et al. states that there was no significant variation in cholesterol levels in any group. The difference in outcomes in both articles probably comes from the different exercises and intervention times applied in each study [38].  In the study by Grant M et al.",ea3345cf-f959-41da-ac75-10db35cd404b
25,methods25,", the effects of TRF were verified along with HMB supplementation, but did not show significantly different results compared to the group that only practiced TRF [36].  4.3. Ketogenic Diet  This diet focused on fat metabolism as a source of energy and is supported by two studies. Two studies agree that there was an increase in fat metabolism significantly in the subjects who followed this diet [48,49]; however, other studies [24,25,47] did not show a significant difference between the control and the intervened group. The differences in outcomes may be due to the distinct characteristics of the individual subjects recruited. Carr AJ et al. indicated that among the three groups that participated in the study, there were no significant differences between groups, arguing that this could be caused by the high performance capacity of the subjects, who were elite athletes [24].  Research in three studies showed that body mass was reduced in the intervened group [25,48,49].",41e0fa54-1349-4652-bdd3-a86b68674746
26,methods26," However, Kysel C et al. and Gasmin et al. indicate that in addition to reducing fat content, lean body mass was also metabolized [25,34].  The studies of Kysel P et al. [25], Zajac A et al. [48] and Zinn C et al. [49] stated that the participants felt that their athletic performance was significantly reduced compared to the controls and therefore they did not consider it a good diet to improve physical performance. Specifically, Sjodin et al. [40] concluded that a ketogenic diet decreased endurance in physically active women while they were using said nutritional strategy.  On the other hand, the participants of Zinn C et al. [49] indicated an improvement in their well-being, greater speed of recovery, benefits in the health of their skin and a reduction in inflammation.  Our results are in line with current research on the effects of KD in the athletic population.",611e5d54-52cd-4fa5-a703-b9958cf0b424
27,methods27," It affects physical health and has positive effects on fat oxidation but shows conflicting results regarding the effects of a KD on performance, which are mostly shown in the long term. Thus, there are both beneficial and detrimental effects after using a KD strategy in athletic populations [10,51,52,53]. Further research is required to establish recommended protocols regarding a KD for athletes. Furthermore, deleterious effects on stool microbiota and iron metabolism have been shown [51].  Further research exploration is still needed using different intervention times and variation in the individual characteristics of subjects, with different types of exercise and sports levels.  Finally, current research shows limited evidence when sub-grouping findings to specific athletic populations when using nutritional strategies to improve performance.",b780e1fc-36e9-4a46-a99e-1984f5b72be6
28,methods28," In this regard, in order to compound the findings, the effects of specific nutritional interventions to improve performance has only been possible to be shown in relation to resistance athletes, sprinters and cyclists.  Resistance athletes have been shown to increase performance when using IF and TRF interventions, but not when using KD. However, long-term benefits have been shown after using a KD intervention.  Professional sprinters have been shown to increase performance when using TRF but decrease it after using an IF intervention.  Professional cyclists have shown to increase performance when a TRF intervention has been followed.  4.4. Strengths and Limitations of the Study  First, the methodological quality of the literature was reviewed with the PEDro, Internal Validity Scale (IVS) and QUALSYT scales, which increases the quality of the present study and consequently the quality of the results obtained.",12ae1150-aa13-471e-8cd4-623c9a0f93ad
29,methods29," Second, the review of the literature deals with an innovative topic in which eating habits in the field of sports and the aim of improving the health and performance of the athlete are combined. Third, the conclusions of the review serve as a proposal for future studies in which variations in the health and performance of athletes are analyzed after the proposed interventions.  However, some limitations have to be recognized. Some variables in the results may be produced by the individual characteristics of the subjects, for example the different sports performed which included race walkers, cyclists, sprinters, runners, resistance training and overload training, and, furthermore, there were 127 participants who did not specify their preferred physical activity. In addition, because of heterogeneity and risk of bias between studies, we could not reach a clear consensus about specific effects of IF, TRF and KD on specific aerobic or anaerobic sports or sub-grouping.",a0b72643-6a39-4a89-8d15-c6f848652367
30,methods30," Interventions were based on changing the eating habits of sports subjects; hence, participation was limited. Additionally, the length of the intervention studies was also limited. Finally, this review concluded that the analyzed articles presented a medium level, a low level and a high level of methodological quality in the PEDro scale, the Internal Validity Scale (IVS) scale and the QUALSYT scale, respectively. Thus, the results from the present review should be interpreted with caution. Apart from PEDro, Internal Validity Scale (IVS) and QUASYLT used in this study, grey literature databases such as NHS Evidence, New York Academy of Medicine Grey Literature Report, Explore the British Library, TRIP database, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Grey Source, and Open Grey may be explored to detect any relevant unpublished work. However, due to the huge number of references obtained in the main search we considered it unnecessary to increase the search with unpublished work.  4.5.",48b2e4f5-e04b-40e6-92bd-4133d95aed1d
31,methods31," Clinical Application of the Results  Intermittent fasting and time-restricted feeding allow athletes to maintain their physical performance in the same way as with their usual diets, but with the presence of numerous positive effects, such as body weight control by metabolizing fat as an energy source without breaking down muscle tissue, increasing adiponectin levels and consequently improving insulin sensitivity, maintaining white blood cell levels after intense exercise, reducing systemic inflammation caused by low levels of glucose and omega 6 and finally improving personal well-being. However, these nutritional strategies are not in line with recommendations from international organizations such as the International Olympic Committee, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the American College of Sports Medicine, and Dieticians of Canada, which indicate that athletes with high training loads should consume a high-carbohydrate diet [9].",9b1231fc-5b16-42b6-8947-a7d3aa715ed1
32,methods32,"  These effects can be effective in preventing injuries and optimizing healing processes under clinical conditions. By reducing systemic inflammation, controlling body weight, improving insulin sensitivity, and strengthening the immune system, health and quality of life greatly improve. Furthermore, these health benefits will prevent injuries, such as muscle inflammation caused by the accumulation of lactic and pyruvic acid, joint wear or muscle tear, as well as the acceleration of the healing process resulting in optimal recovery. In this regard, IF before exercise may be used as an injury prevention strategy. A recent study by Navarro et al. showed significant differences in load tendon thicknesses (patellar tendon and Achilles tendon) between runners with different number of meals per day, as well as a negative association between tendon thicknesses and meals per day.",27bca28c-a29a-4b75-bfb7-3e2b8e311a25
33,methods33," The hypothesis behind this is based on the likely insulin resistance and hyper-insulinemia state in the athlete, which induces the overexpression of undercarboxylated osteocalcin and loss of bone density and collagen tissue damage by activation of RANKL in bones and increased uptake of glucose in collagen tissue, respectively. The increase in intracellular glucose activates the polyol pathway that induces the production of sorbitol and fructose under severe oxidative stress, which could be responsible for mitochondrial damage and tissue breakdown [54].  On the other hand, although it is out with the focus of the study, it is important to highlight that current research shows nutritional interventions as strategies that benefit the nervous system. In this context, IF produces effects through metabolic, cellular, and circadian mechanisms, leading to anatomical and functional changes in the brain, which might be protective in the development of neurological disorders.",0a46dde6-8b6b-44b8-bf66-b042e2258bc7
34,methods34," Theoretically IF may also be beneficial for neurodevelopmental and mood disorders, but hardly any experimental data exists on this topic [55,56]. Nutritional strategies in order to improve both central and peripheral nervous system may be of great interest to increase health and performance in athletes and future studies are needed [57].  4.6. Future Studies  Studies analyzing the effects of different nutritional strategies, not only IF, TRF or KD but others such as the Mediterranean and vegan diets, on performance, quality of life, nervous system and brain improvement, prevalence of injuries and injury recovery times in athletes, not only in the short but also in the long term, are necessary, as well as specific data on both aerobic and anaerobic sports.

35,methods35,"  Furthermore, studies taking the circadian rhythm into account when planning the timing of food intake based on the time of a match or training in order to increase the athlete’s performance would be of great interest.  5. Conclusions  The methodological quality of the studies assessed with the PEDro scale is considered medium, the internal validity of them is considered low and those valued with the QUALSYT scale had a high quality.  TRF may improve athletic performance in both professional sprinters and resistance athletes through increasing adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivity and decreasing both testosterone and IGF-1 levels after intense physical activity.  An athlete undertaking 5–6 h of exercise after intermittent fasting will improve their performance, specifically resistance athletes, although inconclusive results exist for anaerobic exercise where it may be impaired within the first week.  Both IF and TRF decrease body mass without significantly affecting lean mass.",5f7919c6-70bb-455d-a194-274c933898f7
36,methods36,"  The ketogenic diet reduces body mass by consuming fat, but with the risk of catabolizing lean mass. In relation to performance, controversy still exists in the current research, since there are both beneficial and detrimental effects after using a KD strategy in athletic populations.  The use of different dietary strategies may improve the health and performance of athletes, mainly in the long term after using a KD, while IF and TRF may improve performance in professional sprinters and resistance athletes in the short term.

Intervention A had a mixed diet.  Intervention B had a low-carb ketogenic diet.  After a month with the assigned diet and a week of rest, the groups interchange their diets.	Biochemical analysis.  VO2 peak.  Body composition.	High volume training in a ketogenic diet increases fat metabolism during exercise, observable by low triglyceride levels during max effort training and resting (p = 0.001).  The ketogenic diet reduces body mass (p = 0.011), fat content (p = 0.001) and post-exercise muscle damage, which was observed by lower rest and exercise plasma creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase.  The ketogenic diet reduces physical performance at high intensities evidenced by a lower lactate concentration (p = 0.001).	 Zinn et al.",789fe9b5-485d-4265-ba56-4032f15e2247
