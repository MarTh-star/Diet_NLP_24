0,discussion0," Despite particular safety concerns, the beneficial and advantageous aspects of KD cannot be denied. Because multiple factors are affecting the results, including using different mouse strains, providing KD with different food compositions, short study duration, etc. In the future, studies essentially need to explore the possible factors influencing the responses to KD and improve KD dietary plan for utilizing KD as a dietary therapy to minimize safety concerns.  Factors Affecting Ketogenic Diets Responses  Genetic Control of the Responses to a Ketogenic Diet  Nutrigenetic research suggested that genetic markers critically regulate nutritional interactions that impact body weight and composition, which lays the foundation for personalized nutrition therapy (94, 95).  Barrington et al. (96) observed that mouse genetic backgrounds determined dietary outcomes on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.",ebd1c557-f4e3-4415-8322-75ea8965f805
1,discussion1," Specifically, the study included mice from four inbred strains (A, B6, FVB, and NOD), which accounted for genetic and phenotypic diversity and examined mice’s metabolic responses to four human-comparable mice diets (American, Mediterranean, Japanese and ketogenic diets). The authors revealed that the effects of these diets on metabolic health were indeed dependent on genetic backgrounds. The outcomes of KD on body composition, glucose metabolism and liver health varied markedly among different strains.  The different diet responses could be partly attributable to the genetic background related to varying dietary therapy compliance. Parnell et al. (97) analyzed the interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)) in various cardiometabolic pathways and the intake of different nutrients.",743df36b-da16-4d55-baa5-a20992e80828
2,discussion2," Their results indicated that gene-environment (GxE) genes had better responses to plasma cholesterol-lowering or regression of atherosclerotic plaques, primarily through high-energy diets and fat intake.  As mentioned above, genetic background plays a vital role in individual responses to KDs and may consequently influence the effects of KDs. It is of great importance to take genetic background into account when initiating KD therapy.  Food Composition, Quality and Sources of KDs Influence the Outcome  As KDs are a kind of macronutrient-focused diet, we should fully consider the food composition, quality and sources to avoid potential drawbacks when starting a KD. As indicated in the research by Seidelmann et al. (98), there was a U-shaped association between the percentage of energy consumed from carbohydrates and mortality: 50–55% carbohydrate intake was associated with minimal mortality risk. In comparison, a percentage of <40% or >70% led to greater mortality risk.",b830927c-8770-43a3-b005-5f3bbebc93ee
3,discussion3," Besides, different types of dietary fatty acids have different effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and replacing saturated fatty acid (saturated fatty acid (SFA)) with unsaturated fats especially polyunsaturated fatty acids can lead to a significant reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (99). Moreover, diets that favored plant-derived protein and fat intake were associated with lower mortality than animal-derived protein and fat sources. Thus, the nutrient composition, types and sources should be taken into consideration when prescribing a KD therapy; the diversity in these nutrient details could affect the effects of KD and should be relatively standardized to compare the results.  Duration of KD Therapy Affects the Responses  Interestingly, increasing the therapeutic duration of KDs appears to reduce some safety-related problems (34, 35). For instance, long-term follow-up research has demonstrated that dyslipidemia caused by KDs is transient.",b76b6009-c962-429c-95fb-bb3cec6b032c
4,discussion4," Moreover, over 10 years, KD therapy has ended with normal vascular function as indicated by carotid artery ultrasound (91).  Modified KD Dietary Plan  Because of the irreconcilable options on the therapeutic use of KD, several studies concerning modified KD and cardiovascular risks have been performed. The “Spanish Ketogenic Mediterranean Diet” carried out by Perez-Guisado et al. (76) and two modified KDs (KEMEPHY (77) and KEMEPHY with omega-3 supplementation (78)) employed by Paoli et al. have all displayed beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors. A combined diet consisting of KD and a subsequent Mediterranean-like diet has been proven to decrease cardiovascular risks in patients (79). Therefore, a modified KD or multi-step dietary program including different diet patterns is promising in resolving the safety concerns associated with KDs.",84374d11-65d9-42c0-828f-072ce79e4349
5,discussion5,"  Conclusion  Based on the currently available evidence, KD appears to play a significant role in treating various cardio-metabolic diseases and reveals remarkable effects on cardiovascular function. KD therapy is generally promising in obesity, heart failure, and hypertension, though different voices still exist. In diabetes and dyslipidemia, the performance of KD remains controversial. As for cardiovascular complications of metabolic diseases, current evidence suggests that KD is generally protective to obese related cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), while remaining contradictory to diabetes and other metabolic disorder related cardiovascular disease (CVD)s. Various factors might account for the controversies, including genetic background, duration of therapy, food composition, quality and sources of KDs. Therefore, further studies are warranted to provide concrete and more conclusive opinions.",bd919ee8-ecf9-4d97-a9cb-8df8ae3d15eb
6,discussion6," Also, it is vital to monitor safety-related signs and biomarkers during the KD intervention, although most are reversible or transient. In addition, modified KD could be adequately designed and utilized to enhance compliance as a therapeutic approach. Overall, there is a critical need to conduct more rigorous research focusing on the clinical implication and safety issues of KD.
