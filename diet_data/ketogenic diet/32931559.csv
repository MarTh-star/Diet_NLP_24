0,discussion0," We present a 51-year-old female with type 2 diabetes mellitus on an sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i and a ketogenic diet for three weeks prior to bariatric surgery. Laboratory studies indicated euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) and subsequent acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient stopped canagliflozin 150 mg daily two days prior to surgery. Canagliflozin has a half-life between 10.6-13.1 hours. Therefore, between 3.12% and 6.25% remained in the patient’s system at the time of surgery. In March 2020, FDA announced canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin should be stopped three days prior to scheduled surgery as they are associated with acidosis and serious urinary tract infections [28]. Similarly, an international consensus review on sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors mentioned holding the medication three days before a procedure, especially in patients with decreased calorie intake [29]. However, Pace et al.",5052c143-dced-4d94-8240-fdc31543f63f
1,discussion1," recommended holding sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors preoperatively for at least five days because of the relatively long half-life and serious complication of EKDA [30]. It is crucial to be vigilant about the possibility of a prolonged half-life of sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i in patients with decreased renal function. These patients may need to consider holding medications for longer than the recommended amount of time. Aside from the proper holding time of medication, high-risk patients are not well-characterized. Meyer et al. exposed identifiable precipitants in a series of sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i-associated DKA cases, which indicated risk mitigation potential [31]. In the literature review, there are few similar DKA cases available regarding patients taking sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i against the backdrop of a low carbohydrate diet [32-35]. Shaikh et al. and Tauseef et al.",b74729dd-487d-4131-b0a5-3d47333fd905
2,discussion2," both share euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) examples of diabetics on sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i and ketogenic diets between one to three weeks [32,34]. These cases underscore the importance of considering euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) as a postoperative complication even after appropriate measures are taken to hold sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors. Recurring signs and symptoms to monitor for sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i-associated euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) complications include altered mental status, polyuria, polydipsia, gastrointestinal disturbances (vomiting, abdominal pain), glucosuria, tachypnea, tachycardia, dehydration, or ketosis [36]. Since we do not have preoperative labs on our patient, reported similar cases support the possibility that our patient could have already been in euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) prior to surgery.",a0628df2-5635-42a3-8f8a-c832a9008fa7
3,discussion3," In this case and others, there is potential to avoid the occurrence of DKA through detailed dietary counseling by establishing modifiable risk factors. This case emphasizes the need for further awareness and education of predisposing risk and perioperative management of sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors.  Before insulin treatment was started, the patient's blood work revealed hypokalemia. Arora et al. estimated a 5.6% prevalence of hypokalemia in patients with DKA [37]. The cause of hypokalemia in DKA can be explained by osmotic diuresis. Glucosuria induces volume loss, which prompts the release of aldosterone and, subsequently, potassium secretion [27]. Additionally, ketones are not reabsorbable anions in the distal tubule leading to increased urinary potassium loss. Therefore, total body potassium is generally low in DKA and can reveal itself as hypokalemia. However, hyperkalemia is a more common finding in DKA.",11e4e229-3cfa-445d-abba-457c3ab0f6bb
4,discussion4," This is explained by insulin’s role in the activation of sodium-potassium ATPases, responsible for the movement of potassium into cells. In the insulin-depleted environment of DKA, potassium remains in the extracellular compartment and may manifest as hyperkalemia. High serum potassium can predispose patients to fatal cardiac arrhythmias [37]. However, in patients that present with hypokalemia, treating DKA with insulin can result in profound, symptomatic hypokalemia (<2.5) affecting neuromuscular and cardiopulmonary systems. Severe symptoms can range from muscular necrosis, ascending paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory arrest, etc. [12,19-20,38]. Therefore, the American Diabetes Association guidelines on DKA recommend checking and correcting any hypokalemia before starting IV insulin.  The therapeutic intervention of DKA targets volume restoration, clearing blood ketones, and correcting any electrolyte imbalance.",031d36ae-7a28-4fa3-8977-d7af44c2e03f
5,discussion5," Our patient’s anion gap closed on day three, leaving a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis that persisted for up to 15 days postop. Freire et al. define prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay as three or more and six or more days, respectively [39]. A review of DKA hospitalizations in 2018 revealed a decreasing average length of stay between 2003 and 2014 with the average being 3.24 days in 2014 [40]. Accordingly, the duration of metabolic acidosis reversal caused a prolonged hospital stay in this patient. Although current management guidelines do not describe extended acidosis periods in euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA), there are sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitor-associated euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) cases reported taking longer to treat than DKA in non-users of the medication [29,41-43]. A Korean study revealed a significant ICU stay for DKA lasting four days in sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i users as opposed to the two days of non-users [41].",66b56dbf-b974-4668-a38e-92a9fea4ebf2
6,discussion6," However, there have been few cases describing long treatment times for euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) in particular. In a Japanese case report, one dose of an sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitor in a patient with a low-calorie diet caused euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) lasting about 60 hours after treatment was started [42]. In Ireland, two postoperative sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitor-associated euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) patients took 92 hours to fully recover from ketoacidosis after initiation of treatment [43].  In this patient’s allergy list, sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors are recorded with a life-threatening reaction of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA). The US FDA directs patients to stop taking sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors if they experience symptoms of ketoacidosis or if medical providers suspected ketoacidosis as treatment should be implemented promptly [28].",7dfe31ef-8ef6-4bdb-8703-7adb952bb378
7,discussion7," However, recommendations on reinstituting sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors after an episode of EKDA on the medication is unclear. Very few of the available sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i-associated euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) cases disclose their follow-up management describing if the medication was discontinued or reinitiated after euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) recovery. One case of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) in the setting of sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i and hypertriglyceridemia suggested consulting with an endocrinologist before restarting an sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i [44]. Another recommended close follow-up with nephrology only [36]. In this case, there may be multiple precipitating factors leading to the development of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) including the use of an sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i, ketogenic diet, and the physiologic stress of surgery.",ad3abfaf-df18-4822-9e88-0c87133c57c8
8,discussion8," It is uncertain if the patient would have experienced EKDA if she did not follow a ketogenic diet or undergo surgery. These intricate risk factors and inciting events require more study to investigate the possible reinitiation of sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors in patients where the drug has been shown to prolong life.  Conclusions  As sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i are increasingly prescribed, the reports of associated adverse effects like euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) are also rising. EKDA is characterized by severe metabolic acidosis, ketosis, and serum glucose within normal limits. Our case illustrates sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i-associated euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) in the setting of ketosis-inciting factors including a ketogenic diet and undergoing the physiologic stress of an operation.",478b64a6-22a3-48c8-958e-78e99e4eae56
9,discussion9," Low-carbohydrate intake is known to produce ketones as a primary source of energy and, ultimately, can contribute to ketoacidosis in a patient prone to metabolic dysfunction such as diabetes. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to review modifiable risk factors like diets in patients taking sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2i. Moreover, this euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) case was atypical in the presentation of hypokalemia instead of the more common measurement of hyperkalemia. Vigilant management was highlighted by testing and correcting hypokalemia and avoiding further worsening of hypokalemia with IV insulin before electrolyte correction. The next steps for future study would evaluate the safety of reintroducing an sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibitor after an episode of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis.
