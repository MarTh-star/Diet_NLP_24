0,introduction0,"There is a growing awareness of the significance of the human microbiome in health and disease. Microbial colonization of the skin and epithelial surfaces protects from pathogens. The biofermentation in the colon delivers energy from digestive leftovers and synthesizes a broad spectrum of vitamins and hormone-like substances, which regulate metabolism and neuronal activity (Galland, 2014). The enormous variety of the healthy microbiome conveys antigenic diversity to the host shaping its immunity and autoimmunity (Berer and Krishnamoorthy, 2014).  An ever growing number of studies demonstrates the involvement of the colonic microbiome in obesity, digestive, endocrine, inflammatory, and auto-immune disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS) (Berer and Krishnamoorthy, 2014; Galland, 2014; Glenn and Mowry, 2016).  Topics, methods and results of these studies are well presented and should not be repeated here.",b80533e8-0b9d-42f2-ab00-59dc5350f336
1,introduction1," However, the previous studies of the colonic microbiome in MS were restricted to identification of microbial patterns associated with disease (Miyake et al., 2015; Jangi et al., 2016; Tremlett et al., 2016). We found no literature on the quantitative evaluation of the colonic microbiome in MS patients. Microbial concentrations, however, are an important feature, which directly measures their functional contribution to colonic fermentation. The aim of this study was to compare the concentrations of different microbial groups in MS patients and healthy controls and to follow up changes in the colonic microbiome taking place during ketogenic diet.  The option of ketogenic diet was important for the following reasons: as long as complex microbiomes cannot be reliably transferred, maintained and tested in vitro, all data raised in vivo must remain observational. Therefore, interventions simultaneously affecting the microbiome and disease are necessary to unravel possible causality.",8aff9ea9-8f3f-44a5-b4d5-1e85247f8af5
2,introduction2,"  Ketogenic diet influences brain function, inflammation, immunity and the colonic microbiome. It is increasingly applied in clinical studies (Piccio et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2012; Choi et al., 2016). Different to fasting or mono-diets, ketogenic diet can be maintained over months and is well tolerated. Diet prescriptions are often circumvented in real life. The compliance of the ketogenic diet can be reliably verified through measurement of ketone bodies in blood and urine and cannot be falsified. ",5afffa53-2c33-470d-9074-1cf165b91288
3,methods0," We compared the composition of the colonic microbiota quantitatively in 25 MS patients and 14 healthy controls.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)) with 162 ribosomal RNA derived bacterial Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes was used. Ten of the MS patients received a ketogenic diet for 6 months. Changes in concentrations of 35 numerically substantial bacterial groups were monitored at baseline and at 2, 12, and 23/24 weeks.  Patients/samples Fourteen healthy volunteers from the Laboratories of Centre for Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Leipzig and 25 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis cared for at the Charité hospital were investigated for the composition of their colonic microbiome using fluorescence in situ hybridization ribosomal RNA based Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes available in public resources .",de932896-2c1c-4b51-9c18-26573a48d56c
4,methods1,"  The study was reviewed and approved by institutional review board: Ethikkomission Ethikausschuss 1 an Campus Charite Mitte EA1/130/07.  After the baseline investigation, MS patients received a ketogenic diet for 6 months. The ketogenic diet was designed (1) to achieve a modest ketosis (≥500 μmol/L ß-hydroxybutyrate) in the blood, self-measured after dinner twice a week (FreeStyle Precision, Abbott Diabetes Care Ltd.), (2) to achieve a modest ketosis (≥500 μmol/L acetoacetate) in the urine, self-measured after dinner once a week (Ketostix, Bayer Consumer Care AG), and (3) to maintain compliance. Patients received a booklet with meal suggestions over 28 balanced days and were encouraged to ingest fat. An average daily intake of < 50 g carbohydrates, >160 g fat, and < 100 g protein was recommended.",9c1e2818-52c3-4bfd-9bb1-7702711486cd
5,methods2," Patients received detailed information about nutritional facts, glycemic load and learned how to handle carbohydrates by an experienced nutritional coach during group based workshops on 3 weekends.  Ten of the MS patients who were recruited for the ketogenic diet were randomly selected for accompanying microbiome investigations. Stools samples were collected at baseline, week 2, 12, and after 6 months (week 23–25). The evaluation of the clinical effects on MS was not performed because of the low number of patients.  None of the enclosed probands received antibiotics or probiotics in the last 6 month preceding the study.  Fish Colonic microbiota were investigated using Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with ribosomal RNA derived probes. Hybridizations were performed on sections of Carnoy fixated, paraffin embedded and otherwise not manipulated stool cylinders . Four micrometers thick sections were placed on SuperFrost plus slides.",beca2362-a296-4e91-ab91-1b8253b7fbf0
6,methods3,"  A Nikon e600 fluorescence microscope was used. The images were photo-documented with a Nikon DXM 1200F color camera and software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).  Bacterial concentrations of homogeneous populations were enumerated visually in one of the 10 × 10 fields of the ocular raster corresponding to 10 × 10 μm of the section surface at magnification of 1,000. This number was assigned to a concentration of × 109 bacteria/ml, which was most equivalent to the calculation formula, that we had used previously .  In case of uneven distribution of bacteria over the microscopic field, the positive signals were enumerated in 10 fields of the ocular raster along the gradient of distribution and divided by 10.  Bacteria were quantified using group specific C3 probes.",7b2a4ebb-ecf2-4e98-ad48-ba0349b8f964
7,methods4," The FITC marked universal probe was used in each hybridization to evaluate the number of all bacteria, C5 marked probes with a different specificity to C3 probes were used to determine the spatial relation of different bacterial groups to each other.  Only signals that hybridized with a specific Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe and the universal Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe, but did not hybridize with specific Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes from unrelated bacterial groups, were enumerated (Swidsinski, 2006).  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes One hundred sixty-two bacterial Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes available from public resources were applied for the comparative analysis of the colonic microbiome in healthy controls and MS patients (Tables 1A,B).

We called these groups essential bacteria.  All other investigated bacterial groups were individual, detectable only in a subset of patients. We called them individual bacterial groups.  Twenty-eight of the individual bacterial groups were found in at least 30% of the probands (mostly 50–70%) in concentrations of higher than 109 bacteria/ml.

20,results2,"  Four of the individual bacterial groups including Bif (Bifidobacteriacae), Ebac (Enterobacteriaceae), Clit (Clostridium lituseburense), and Cdif (Clostridium difficile) are often found prevalent in newborns, after antibiotic treatment and convalescence patients and thus represent bacterial groups with pioneer function. We evaluated these groups separately.  Individual bacterial groups detected with 88 Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes (Table 1B) were observed in one, maximal two individuals in marginal concentrations of ≤0.1 × 109 ml. We called these individual marginal bacterial groups. Because of the uneven distribution of such bacteria over the stool cylinder, their quantification was highly unreliable.  Thirty-one of investigated Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes showed multiple uncharacteristic signals, in form and distribution, cross-reacting with unrelated bacterial groups.",77d8f489-9c88-429b-a9b2-42b0c5e47aaf

Microbiome in healthy controls and MS patients prior to diet intervention The morphologic appearance of single bacteria detected with corresponding Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes was the same in MS patients and healthy controls.

No rise of single marginal groups in MS patients was observed.  The difference in the microbiome of MS patients and healthy controls became striking, when concentrations of numerically substantial groups were summarized and considered as a whole (Table 2, marked in bold). The diversity of all substantial groups in MS patients was reduced by 36% (P < 0.001), the mean sum concentrations of all substantial bacterial groups were reduced by 24% (65 vs. 85.4 × 109/bacteria/ml., P < 0.001) compared to healthy controls.",a90879b9-ccd1-4f7f-8c0e-a303a48bb5f1

Changes of the colonic microbiome with the ketogenic diet in 10 MS patients The changes in the microbiome during the ketogenic diet were univocal. Except for Akkermansia, all groups of bacteria demonstrated consistently more or less marked decreases, leading to a reduction of the total bacterial concentrations of the substantial bacteria from 65 to 25 × 109 bacteria per ml at week 2.

This increase was consistent for all but the pioneer bacterial groups and Akkermansia. The concentrations of pioneer bacterial groups fell and remained low, the concentrations of Akkermansia increased initially but then declined during the ketogenic diet.

26,discussion0,"Previous investigation, using high throughput DNA sequencing technologies in large scale 16S rRNA or shotgun metagenomic sequencing, demonstrated miscellaneous changes in the composition of the colonic microbiome, which correlated with MS, MS-onset, -therapy or -relapse (Kim et al., 2012; Berer and Krishnamoorthy, 2014; Galland, 2014; Miyake et al., 2015; Glenn and Mowry, 2016; Jangi et al., 2016; Tremlett et al., 2016). Both single bacterial groups were found differently represented and also the whole microbiome was aberrantly composed. While the alpha diversity of MS and the healthy microbiome was similar, the beta diversity differed significantly. In ecology, alpha diversity expresses the mean species diversity in sites or habitat at a local scale, while beta diversity is the ratio between regional and local diversity. The differences indicated shifts in composition of the MS microbiome. The meaning of these observations is unclear.",22723eee-156f-4a43-9e9a-3e1f902a358d
27,discussion1," The pure occurrence of bacteria does not automatically mean that they are relevant or biochemically active. The vacant niches may be occupied by chance.  Although we applied publically available Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes as broadly as possible and included all groups covering numerically substantial components of the colonic microbiome, no conclusions to the entire biodiversity are possible, since Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) reliably detects only bacteria in concentrations of higher than 105 per ml.  However, while sequence analysis is perfect for identification of specific occurrence patterns, its information on physical abundance and contribution of bacteria to biofermentation is poor. Abundance of bacteria within the fecal mass however directly expresses their biofermenting power.  Our data quantifying microbial participants clearly demonstrate the impaired colonic function in patients with MS.",e0710270-2859-4497-a870-db73f61d9aec
28,discussion2," Both concentrations and biodiversity of numerically substantial bacterial groups were markedly reduced in MS. Essential bacteria were most, individual substantial bacteria less depleted, while pioneer bacteria were nearly unchanged.  This grading of suppression matches well with the proposed role of these groups for colonic function. Essential bacteria are present in every healthy person in large concentrations, contributing roughly to approximately half of the mass of the colonic microbiome. They are obviously important for colonic fermentation and represent main fermentative groups in human. The individual substantial bacterial groups are present only in subsets of healthy persons in varying concentrations, which are each distinctly lower than those of the essential bacterial groups. Their presence is dispensable for colonic fermentation.",7b60028c-a7bd-4b5c-b5af-53cb2feda505
29,discussion3," However, their diversity is high, composition specific for each subject, indicating that they fulfill special tasks not covered by the essential bacterial groups. Despite markedly lower concentrations, when compared to essential bacterial groups, the individual substantial groups constitute together another half of the colonic biomass.  Pioneer bacteria are usually found in low concentration in healthy adults. Their concentrations are high in newborns after antibiotic treatment and in convalescence, while the colonic microbiome is reshaped .  The fall in concentration in MS patients was gradual, decreasing from essential to individual substantial and further to pioneer bacterial groups. This suggests that the suppression is not due to the loss of responsible microbial groups or reshaping of the microbiome.",7db29ea6-3275-4498-bae1-a05d419a23af
30,discussion4," It presumably results from the general downregulation of the colonic biofermentative function and affects mainly biofermentative active groups, leaving bacterial groups with other specific tasks untouched.  We observed no changes in the microbiome that could be specific for MS.  While mean concentrations of all essential bacteria detected with EREC (mainly Roseburia), Bac303 (Bacteroides), Fprau (F. prausnitzii) probes were consistently reduced in MS, the shifts in individual substantial bacterial groups were multidirectional with concentrations of some bacterial groups unchanged, increased or reduced when compared to healthy controls. Although some of the differences reached the level of statistical significance, the fluctuations in concentrations of individual substantial bacterial groups were moderate and in the range of those, when unmatched groups of subjects are compared with each other.",fa0bf266-97f3-408d-9d7f-540a474d3c6d
31,discussion5," Similar fluctuations are documented while describing microbiome composition in other pathologies such as diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and others .  Since the microbiome is influenced by a multiplicity of racial, occupational, social, regional, and geographic factors, matching for all of them would be an impossible task. Mean values raised in small cohorts should therefore be critically evaluated, even when they occasionally prove to be statistically highly significant . Our data allow definitively no conclusions to whether the observed alterations in concentrations of colonic bacteria precede, result, specifically accompany MS or rely on independent coincident processes such as aberrant immunity, impaired digestion or simply changed behavior.",3cb9ba06-d2b5-4ab1-93b8-4ee53f67931e
32,discussion6," However, they clearly demonstrate that the perturbation of the microbiome in MS is not inherent and inevitable but can be definitively corrected with diet, supplementation and other means as assumed previously .  After 6 months on the ketogenic diet, the sum concentrations of the substantial microbial groups in MS patients increased significantly when compared to the period prior to intervention (83 vs. 65 × 109 bacteria/ml; P = 0.02) and became indistinguishable from the healthy group (83 vs. 85.4 × 109 bacteria/ml. P = 0.7).  Our data also demonstrate that the tracking of the changes in the microbiome should not be restricted to a single time point, but needs surveillance over longer periods of time.  The reduction of microbial concentrations observed 2 weeks after the start of the diet was dramatic, the ranges of suppression were comparable to antibiotics effects .",94219022-2056-47ca-ae7d-92c37799bf7e
33,discussion7," Concentrations of some individual substantial groups fell under detection limit, leading to further drop in the microbial diversity from mean 48 to 35 percent. However, the processes behind dietetic and antibiotic effects are principally different.  The improvement with antibiotic treatment occurred only after the end of treatment, while with the ketogenic diet, the improvement occurred in succession of the diet and the long-term effects of diet were opposite to the immediate response to the intervention. Although the diversity of the microbiome did not reach the values typical for the healthy population, at the end of the observation period, after 6 months on the ketogenic diet, it completely recovered as compared to basic values prior to treatment.  Obviously the increase in microbial concentrations was mainly due to improvement of colonic function and achieved by preexisting microbial groups.",bd7f2df6-1770-4ea1-bf6a-ee0352d27060
34,discussion8," Typical for convalescence after depletion of the colonic microbiome following antibiotic use, stroke or inflammation is a temporary excess of pioneer bacterial groups. Such excess was not observed with the ketogenic diet. In contrast, the pioneer bacterial groups remained reduced over the whole duration of the ketogenic diet (p < 0.05–0.008), indicating an absence of substantial microbiome reshaping.  Although the concentrations and the biodiversity of colonic microbiota are strong markers of the intensity of the microbial metabolism, the shifts in bacterial groups per se do not reveal the exact metabolic changes taking place. The role of single substances and metabolites in neurologic disorders is still to be unraveled and follow our preliminary observations.  Summarizing, we state that colonic microbiome and neuropathology are closely interrelated. Concentrations of numerically substantial biofermentative bacteria are significantly reduced in MS patients.",e9f26af3-829d-497c-b018-f513a61db358
35,discussion9, The microbial shifts can be reliably quantified and monitored by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) under ambulatory conditions. The ketogenic diet for 6 months completely restored the microbial biofermentation mass and is an interesting interventional tool for prospective clinical studies. ,721b9c99-a695-4fa5-831a-b26c4c8617a1
