0,abstract0,"  The ketogenic diet (KD), which can induce changes in gut microbiota, has shown benefits for epilepsy and several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effects of a KD on glucose and lipid metabolism remain inconclusive. Using two formulas of ketogenic diets (ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) with 89.5% fat and KDH with 91.3% fat), which are commonly used in mouse trials, we found that ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) but not KDH induced insulin resistance and damaged glucose homeostasis, while KDH induced more fat accumulation in mice. Further study showed that KD impacted glucose metabolism, which was related to the sources of fat, while both the sources and proportions of fat affected lipid metabolism. And the KD widely used in human studies still induced insulin resistance and fat accumulation in mice.",3b578a70-5d08-484f-ac0c-0c28fb6f65a6
1,abstract1," Moreover, KDs changed the gut microbiota and metabolites in mice, and the sources and proportions of fat in the diets respectively changed the abundance of specific bacteria and metabolites which were correlated with parameters related to glucose intolerance and lipid accumulation. Overall, our study demonstrated that the metabolic disorders induced by KDs are closely related to the source and proportion of fat in the diet, which may be associated with the changes of the gut microbiota and metabolites.

2,introduction0,"  Ketogenic diet (KD) refers to an extremely high-fat, very low-carbohydrate diet, which has shown its value in treating epilepsy and its increasing application to other diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, and metabolic syndrome (1, 2). However, reports about the effects of a KD on glucose and lipid metabolism in rodents and humans remain inconclusive. Previous clinical trials showed the effectiveness of weight loss and improvement in glucose tolerance and serum lipids in overweight/obese subjects (3–6). However, a 3-day KD increased postprandial plasma glucose in healthy men (7). Although it decreased triglycerides, a KD increased cholesterol and inflammatory markers in overweight/obese subjects after 4 weeks of dietary intervention (8). In a rodent trial, a KD reduced circulating glucose and lipids in both normal-weight and ob/ob mouse models (9) and improved glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese mice (10).",7ebde8d9-c52c-4997-9bd7-d3e6e11596cf
3,introduction1," Nevertheless, several studies found that a KD has negative effects, including hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance (11–17), and a recent study showed that 2 to 4 months of KD feeding depleted adipose-resident γδ T cells, which could restrain inflammation, resulting in impaired glucose homeostasis (18). Although the diets mentioned above are all called a “ketogenic diet,” the differences in ingredients and dietary composition even in more controlled and standardized animal studies still exist. Therefore, clearly exploring the impact of a KD on glucose and lipid metabolism is needed.  The gut microbiota is critically influenced by diet and has been considered a key mediator linking diet and host physiology (19).",b9b313e4-cfcd-42d7-afb7-cfb90fac3095
4,introduction2," Previous work found that a KD altered the structure of gut microbiota, and specific KD-associated bacteria could protect against seizures in mouse models of intractable epilepsy, which was further confirmed because the protective effects disappeared when mice were treated with antibiotics or reared germfree (20). Furthermore, a recent study showed that a KD decreased the abundance of Bifidobacterium, and KD-associated gut microbiota reduced the levels of intestinal proinflammatory Th17 cells (21). Therefore, whether the gut microbiota altered by a KD affects host glucose and lipid metabolism became an interesting question, as did whether microbe-associated metabolites also play a role.  Here, to evaluate the effects of KD on host glucose and lipid metabolism, gut microbiota, and microbe-associated metabolites, two kinds of ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials, type 1 (ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR)) and type 2 (KDH), were investigated in mice.",ccc3ff4d-51ed-440d-9e20-666b51660b69
5,introduction3," We found that ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) but not KDH induced insulin resistance and damage to glucose homeostasis, while KDH induced more fat accumulation in mice, which was associated with their distinct effects on the gut microbiota and metabolite profiles. Moreover, we showed that the differences in metabolic phenotypes in mice induced by these two kinds of KD may be due to the sources and proportions of fat in the diet.

30,results0,"  Ketogenic diets induced glucose intolerance and lipid accumulation in mice.  To observe how two kinds of ketogenic diets impacted physiological and metabolic consequences in mice, 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned into four groups: (i) fed ketogenic diet type 1 (ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR), caloric ratio of 89.5% fat, 0.1% carbohydrate, and 10.4% protein), (ii) fed control normal chow of ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) (NCR, caloric ratio of 10% fat, 70% carbohydrate, and 20% protein), (iii) fed ketogenic diet type 2 (KDH, caloric ratio of 91.3% fat, 1% carbohydrate, and 7.7% protein), and (iv) fed control normal chow of KDH (normal chow (NCH), caloric ratio of 15.5% fat, 64.5% carbohydrate, and 20% protein). Details of these diets are shown in Table S1 in the supplemental material.",1bfa2431-1751-4770-896b-38db84d3ac21

First, we observed how these two kinds of KD affected glucose metabolism.",07c4f03c-64df-49ff-9c47-fe632f2f43dd
33,results3," We did oral glucose tolerance test (oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) after 2 and 5 weeks of dietary intervention and found that the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) mice showed significantly higher fasting blood glucose levels than the NCR mice, but there was no significant difference between the mice in the KDH and normal chow (NCH) groups (Fig. 1a). Moreover, we found that the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) mice but not KDH mice had slower glucose clearance than their control group during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1b). Although the secretion of insulin was similar among the four groups of mice, which was confirmed by fasting blood insulin levels and immunofluorescence staining for insulin in the pancreas (Fig.",89293edf-53af-4b9e-91ea-dc53ed05be72
34,results4," 1c and d), the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index and insulin resistance index were significantly increased in the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) mice (Fig. 1e to g). These results suggested that ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) but not KDH induced insulin resistance and damage to glucose homeostasis in mice.

36,results6," n = 8 to 9 for both groups for all analyses except n = 5 for panel l.  Next, we observed how these two kinds of KD impacted lipid metabolism. After 5 weeks of dietary intervention, the KDH mice had lower body weights (Fig. S1c) and higher weights of epididymal and retroperitoneal fat mass (Fig. 1h and i) than the normal chow (NCH) mice. Furthermore, the KDH mice also exhibited excessive lipid accumulation in the liver with increased concentrations of liver total cholesterol and triglyceride compared to the normal chow (NCH) mice (Fig. 1j and k). However, there was no significant difference in the above parameters between the mice in the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) and NCR groups.",f51473ee-6370-467a-9278-4b5c6059acb0
37,results7," Both the adipocyte size and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) activity score significantly increased in the mice fed the two kinds of KD compared to their respective control groups, which were estimated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained epididymal fat and liver, and the KDH mice had significantly higher values than the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) mice (Fig. 1l and m). These results suggested that KDH induced more fat accumulation in mice than ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR).  Previous studies have shown that metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)), which disrupt glucose and lipid metabolism, are characterized by an impaired and defective intestinal barrier (22).",f3e373f9-e089-48b9-8e6d-da9b20bfac75
38,results8," To determine whether intestinal permeability was impacted by two kinds of KD, we measured the expression of Zo-1, Occludin, Muc1, Muc2, and Muc3 in the colon. The ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) and KDH mice showed significantly lower expression of Occludin and Muc2 than their control groups, implying that the intestinal barrier was damaged in the mice fed with the two kinds of KD (Fig. S1d), which was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining for ZO-1 in the ileum (Fig. S1e). Moreover, we found that the serum level of lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS))-binding protein (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP)) was significantly enhanced in the mice fed with the two kinds of KD, implying increased intestinal permeability to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and there was no difference between the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) and KDH mice (Fig. S1f).",266da742-54ac-4366-8f37-431112371f5e
39,results9," These results suggested that both ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) and KDH impaired intestinal barrier function in mice.  Two kinds of ketogenic diets molded disparate gut microbiota in mice.  By quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting the 16S rRNA gene, we found that the total bacterial loads in feces were similar among the four groups of mice (Fig. S2a). To analyze whether the structure of gut microbiota was modulated by these two kinds of KD, we sequenced the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region of fecal samples collected at the 5th week. After 5 weeks of intervention, the richness and diversity of gut microbiota, which were reflected by the numbers of observed amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and the Shannon index, were significantly increased only in the KDH mice but not in the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) mice compared to their control groups (Fig. S2b).",be061884-f9da-4696-8070-537a2bd942d6
40,results10," Principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERManalyzed with one way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) based on Bray-Curtis distances showed clear separations of gut microbiota structure between the mice in the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) and NCR groups, as well as the KDH and normal chow (NCH) groups (P < 0.01 with PERManalyzed with one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), 9,999 permutations). Although the gut microbiota structures were more similar in the mice fed the two kinds of KD than in mice fed the two control diets, there was still a significant difference between the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) and KDH mice (Fig. 2a and b).

We constructed sparse partial least-squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) models to identify members of the gut microbiota responding to these two kinds of KD intervention. We found that 44 ASVs were shifted in the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) mice compared to the NCR mice, while 40 ASVs showed differences between the KDH and normal chow (NCH) mice (Fig. S3a and b).",864e7b5d-b2dc-4035-976c-f5cf36180a3c
43,results13," Notably, only 16 ASVs showed the same changes in both the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) and KDH mice. Of these, the abundances of ASVs, including Ruminococcaceae (ASV208, ASV291), Intestinimonas (ASV43, ASV96, ASV272), and Lachnospiraceae (ASV44, ASV18, ASV159, ASV164, ASV165), were significantly enriched by both types of KD, and all these ASVs positively correlated with parameters related to glucose intolerance and lipid accumulation. Furthermore, 6 ASVs, including Enterococcus (ASV5), Blautia (ASV31), Turicibacter (ASV38), Lachnoclostridium (ASV56), and Lachnospiraceae (ASV59, ASV65), were significantly decreased by both KDs, and all these ASVs negatively correlated with parameters related to glucose intolerance and lipid accumulation. Next, we compared the gut microbiota in mice with the two types of KD and identified 38 significantly different ASVs (Fig. S3c).",aa1a62ed-cd27-49d9-8a66-e1c18db10b86
44,results14," Among these 38 ASVs, Bacteroides (ASV8, ASV36, ASV42), Lachnospiraceae (ASV313), and Ruminococcaceae (ASV60, ASV73) were significantly enriched in the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) mice and only positively correlated with parameters related to glucose intolerance. Moreover, Roseburia (ASV9, ASV63), Negativibacillus (ASV112), Acetatifactor (ASV22), Oscillibacter (ASV202), Lachnoclostridium (ASV285), and Lachnospiraceae (ASV25, ASV157, ASV159, ASV160, ASV169, ASV279, ASV286, ASV316) were significantly increased in the KDH mice and only positively correlated with parameters related to lipid accumulation (Fig. 2c).

The sources and proportions of fat in the ketogenic diet affected the metabolic phenotypes in mice.  The two kinds of KD induced different damage to metabolic phenotypes in mice, which was associated with gut microbiota and metabolite changes, although the components of macronutrients were virtually identical in ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) and KDH. Then, we customized a ketogenic diet called KD(89.",08ef7100-2143-493b-8780-784e3681b928

We obtained comparable results for parameters related to glucose and lipid metabolism for the mice fed KDH and normal chow (NCH) to those in the above-mentioned trial. Unlike the mice in the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) group, which had dramatic damage to glucose metabolism, the KD(89.5%) mice had fasting blood glucose levels, glucose clearance, and insulin resistance indices similar to the KDH mice (Fig. 4a to f). Furthermore, the KD(89.5%) mice exhibited an increase in epididymal and retroperitoneal fat mass compared to the normal chow (NCH) mice (Fig. 4g to i), which was not observed between the mice in the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) and NCR groups. Interestingly, the KD(89.",32afb1b9-fb3c-409b-a94f-20e1dccddddb

Based on the above results, we concluded that the sources of fat in ketogenic diets had important and significantly different effects on metabolic phenotypes in mice.

Combining the results that ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) but not KDH induced insulin resistance and damaged glucose homeostasis in mice, we speculated that the trans-fatty acids (TFAs) in ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) may be an important suspect.  10.1128/mBio.03601-20.5 FIG S5 The concentrations of trans-6,9,11-octadecenoic acid in three different ketogenic diets [ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR), KDH, and KD(89.5%)].

Taken together, we identified 10 ASVs and 4 ASVs that responded to the sources and proportions of fat in ketogenic diets, respectively. Thus, these 14 ASVs were considered key members that were affected by the sources and proportions of fat in the two kinds of KD.

From untargeted metabolome data, we showed that KDs affected many of the gut microbiota-related metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s), tryptophan metabolites, and bile acids (BAs). Thus, we quantified the concentrations of 4 main tryptophan metabolites, 6 short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s, and 40 BAs with LC-MS or gas chromatography (GC)-MS. Consistent with the results in untargeted metabolome, we also observed decreased tryptophan metabolites in both the KDH and KD(89.5%) mice (Fig. 5d). Moreover, we found that the concentrations of short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s significantly decreased in the KDH and KD(89.5%) mice, and there was no significant difference between the mice of these two groups. This suggested that decreased short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s may be related to lack of carbohydrates in the KD (Fig. 5e).",9fbe6b95-3bbb-445a-860c-7c547b84b0a0
63,results33," Furthermore, we observed the concentrations of 10 BAs were significantly different in the mice of different groups. Among them, deoxycholic acid (DCA), which belongs to secondary BAs, was significantly increased in both the KDH and KD(89.5%) mice. Notably, the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) mice had significantly higher deoxycholic acid (DCA) and Cdeoxycholic acid (DCA) levels than the KDH mice in untargeted metabolome, but there was no significant difference between the mice in the KD(89.5%) and KDH groups, suggesting that the differences of deoxycholic acid (DCA) and Cdeoxycholic acid (DCA) levels in the ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) and KDH mice may be due to different fat sources in the KD (Fig. 5f).  The ketogenic diet used in human studies still impaired metabolic health, gut microbiota, and metabolites in mice.",b62ed7a1-8d13-4d4e-85d8-5abcaa22e5a9
64,results34,"  Considering that the ketogenic diets used in the above two trials were nearly devoid of carbohydrates, the ketogenic diets used in human studies permit low carbohydrate consumption (approximately 5% to 10% of total caloric intake or below 50 g per day) (19). Thus, we customized another ketogenic diet called KD(72%) with 72% fat, 20% protein, and 8% carbohydrate. Notably, to eliminate the influence of TFAs in diet, KD(72%) used the same sources of nutrients as KDH. We observed increased β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations in the KD(72%) mice [NC, 0.44; KD(72%), 0.8 mmol/liter; P < 0.001]. Moreover, KD(72%) damaged metabolic health, which was mainly reflected in two aspects. First, although the fasting blood glucose level and glucose clearance during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in the KD(72%) mice were similar to those in the NC group (Fig. 6a and b), the secretion of insulin was significantly higher in the KD(72%) mice (Fig.",bd3d0f89-89c1-484a-a9e8-b459440d6251
65,results35," 6c and d), and the KD(72%) mice also had a higher HOMA-IR index and insulin resistance index (Fig. 6e and f). This suggests that insulin sensitivity was reduced in the KD(72%) mice. Second, the KD(72%) mice showed significantly higher fat mass and larger adipocyte size than the NC mice (Fig. 6g and h). To summarize, these results showed that KD(72%) induced insulin resistance and fat accumulation in mice.  FIG 6 KD(72%) impaired metabolic health in mice. (a) Fasting blood glucose.

Although selected specific ASVs were not exactly the same (Fig. S7), KD(72%) still enhanced the abundance of Roseburia, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae and reduced the abundance of Turicibacter similarly to the KDs in the above-mentioned trials (Fig. 7b).

69,discussion0,"  In the current study, we showed that the impaired glucose and lipid metabolism in mice induced by KDs may be due to the sources and proportions of fat in these diets, which are associated with their distinct effects on gut microbiota and metabolites.  The KDs, regardless of the proportions and sources of fat, impaired glucose and lipid metabolism in mice in our study, which is in agreement with previous reports that KDs caused glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and fat accumulation (11–17). Several studies had reported the possible mechanisms of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance induced by KDs, such as the reduction in γδ T cells that can restrain inflammation (18), or the decreased cell surface expression of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle, which reduces glucose uptake in the periphery (11). Regarding the hepatic lipid accumulation induced by KD, Schugar et al.",e7926d76-a129-4c32-a546-66ee2a70b883
70,discussion1," reported that the synergistic effects of protein restriction and choline deficiency may be potential contributors (23). Notably, an impaired colonic mucus barrier has been suggested as one of the causes of metabolic damage (24), and the expression of genes related to the intestinal barrier (Occludin, Muc2) was significantly reduced by 5 weeks of KD consumption in our work. Although improved serum glucose and reduced weight were reported in short-term (1-week) KD studies (6, 18, 20), our work observed that extending feeding time with KD impaired host metabolism, especially in glucose tolerance and hepatic lipid accumulation. The glucose and lipid metabolism disorders are a gradual accumulation process, and our work emphasizes that there is a risk of metabolic disorders on a long-term KD. Future work is still needed to identify the overall mechanism by which KDs impair glucose and lipid metabolism.",64c22421-deb9-48db-a7f0-3746ecbc01a7
71,discussion2,"  The destruction of glucose and lipid metabolism induced by KDs may be partly related to the changes in the gut microbiota and metabolites. In the current work, both two types of KD induced the changes of gut microbiota and metabolites. For example, we found that the increase in the abundance of many ASVs belonging to Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae was correlated with impaired lipid metabolism induced by two formulas of KD. Previously, a strain belonging to Lachnospiraceae was reported to induce the development of obesity and diabetes in germfree ob/ob mice (25). However, we also observed that the abundance of few ASVs belonging to Lachnospiraceae decreased in KD-fed mice, indicating that the response of gut microbiota to KD is species and strain specific, and this may explain our inconsistency with other studies (21).",e39a7b5f-2373-4114-a8af-4e3cf9da4915
72,discussion3," Furthermore, 3 ASVs belonging to Bacteroides were enriched only in our ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) mice, which could convert primary BAs into secondary BAs through the production of bile salt hydrolase (bile salt hydrolase (BSH)) (26). Recent studies reported that transplantation of Bacteroides vulgatus resulted in insulin resistance in recipient mice (27). In addition, a high secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA) level was observed in our ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) mice. deoxycholic acid (DCA) could bind to farnesoid X receptor (farnesoid X receptor (FXR)), and the activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) could induce metabolic disorders (28). Thus, ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) induces severe glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in mice, which may be due to increased abundance of Bacteroides and high deoxycholic acid (DCA) level.",221b98b0-3f01-4148-b043-da574f41fe40
73,discussion4," Notably, we found that the abundance of Lactobacillus murinus was decreased in the mice with KD. In our previous studies, we found abundant Lactobacillus murinus in the mice with calorie restriction (CR) (29, 30), which was significantly correlated with the improvement of midlife metabolic phenotypes. Moreover, we isolated a strain, L. murinus CR147, from the feces of CR mice and showed that this strain reduced intestinal permeability and systemic inflammatory markers in old microbiota-colonized mice (30). The beneficial effects of Lactobacillus murinus on glucose and lipid metabolism may be related to the ability to produce short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s and convert tryptophan into indole derivatives (31). short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s can protect the intestinal barrier by increasing the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) (32) and exert anti-inflammatory effects by binding the G-protein-coupled receptor 41/43 (GPR41/43) (33).",0865b750-8c07-42ab-86a9-4d1280c4e745
74,discussion5," indole acetic acid (IAA) was reported to play a role as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in regulation of intestinal health (34). indole 3 propanoic acid (IPA) can decrease intestinal permeability mediated by the pregnane X receptor (pregnane X receptor (PXR)) (35). The impaired intestinal barrier and an inflammatory condition have been regarded as a crucial pathological process underlying metabolic disorders (22, 36). In our work, decreased levels of short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s and tryptophan metabolites were observed in the mice with KD. Therefore, the decreased abundance of Lactobacillus murinus induced by two formulas of KD may contribute to the impaired glucose and lipid metabolism. Our studies pointed out that candidate bacteria and their potential metabolites correlated with KD-induced metabolic disorders. In future studies, we should use these specific bacteria and their metabolites responding to KD to investigate its causality in metabolic disorders and involved mechanism.",a47c4de5-af46-42c2-a08c-65be4998d5e1
75,discussion6,"  More importantly, we showed that both the sources and proportions of fat in the KDs modified glucose and lipid metabolism in mice, suggesting that the controversial results from previous reports may be due to neglect of the composition of the KD. We found that ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) but not KDH induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. A recent study using the same KD as our ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) demonstrated that long-term KD feeding depleted adipose-resident γδ T cells, leading to obesity and the loss of glycemic regulation in mice (18). Previous studies using a diet consistent with our KDH showed that KD reduced serum glucose in animal models (20, 37). In our study, we analyzed the composition of these two formulas of KD and found that their sources of fat are very different.",87bec2b6-0a8b-4bf4-b6ba-ac3775616bd7
76,discussion7," Therefore, future work in animal and clinical studies related to diet and nutritional intervention should consider not only the proportion of nutrients but also the source.  For the diets used in animal trials, the source of them may have an impact on the experimental results, especially in metabolic phenotypes. For example, ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR)-induced severe glucose intolerance in mice may be due to high TFAs levels in fat. In epidemiological investigations, TFA intake was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (38, 39). And in a mouse model, high TFA intake resulted in decreased sensitivity of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and downregulation of adipose triglyceride lipase (adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL)) expression in the liver (40).",b3b135fc-0e4e-4041-bbba-f59912e104da
77,discussion8," In an in vitro model, trans-9-octadecenoic acid may reduce the glucose uptake by cells through suppressing insulin-induced elevations of phosphorylated Akt levels and the fusion of GLUT4 storage vesicles (41). Our ketogenic diets commonly used in mouse trials type 1 (KDR) (Research Diets D12369B) is a KD commonly used in animal trials, and the experimental results of the previous studies using this diet cannot be attributed to high fat content completely but may also be related to TFAs in fat.  Overall, our study demonstrated that the metabolic disorders induced by KDs are closely related to the source and proportion of fat in the diet, which may be associated with the changes of the gut microbiota and metabolites. Although KDs have beneficial effects on epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases (1), according to our findings, KDs truly impair glucose and lipid metabolism.",7a1dc2bd-1ad3-411f-a472-ad61d2679717
78,discussion9," Thus, when using these diets for weight loss and the treatment of other conditions, the risk of glucose and lipid metabolism disorders should be kept in mind, and the sources and proportions of fat in these diets need to be further evaluated.
