0,discussion0," Nutrition studies have often received flak for their lack of credibility due to variations in recording quantities of foods and the subjective nature of the frequency of the various food regimen methods. Using biomarkers can enable a more objective assessment of food consumption and virtually eliminate bias using self-reported dietary assessments [20]. This case study utilized biomarker assessment at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks and attempted to assess dietary compliance through blood glucose and ketone-testing results. The use of a KetoMojo home blood glucose/ketone meter further assisted in validating dietary compliance [21].  Additionally, the nutritional content of various foods as documented in nutrition databases can be inconsistent due to multiple variables and may not reflect the exact nutrient content. Therefore, the use of biomarker assessment can further confirm nutritional composition, as in the case of our study participant.",bf48b369-2406-46ce-98f9-e0c384848580
1,discussion1," The combination of both a food-tracking tool, in this case, the MyFitnessPal app (Under Armour, Inc., Baltimore, MD) and biomarkers of health can provide valuable instruments for estimating nutrient intake and assessing health risks [20]. One example entails assessing fasting plasma glucose levels and associations with improved insulin sensitivity or plasma triglycerides and the link to cardiovascular disease [20].  According to a meta-analysis by Qiu et al. (2019), PD can be associated with an increase in C reactive protein (CRP) levels, potentially revealing a link between increased inflammation as measured by C reactive protein (CRP) and the development of PD [21]. Our participant's C reactive protein (CRP) was slightly higher at baseline (1.29 mg/L) than at 12 weeks (1.09 mg/L), which then further decreased at 24 weeks (0.64 mg/L).",ca96c121-c7c8-4785-8873-b7096ae526c8
2,discussion2," Even though her C reactive protein (CRP) levels were not significantly elevated at baseline, the 24-week results did indicate a reduction in this marker of inflammation. According to Loefler et al. (2015), in addition to motor signs and symptoms, people with PD can suffer from autonomic dysfunction and poor emotional regulation resulting in apathy, depression, and anxiety. Our participant demonstrated a modest reduction in symptoms of depression and anxiety after the 24-week dietary intervention.  The LCHF nutritional approach has been demonstrated to result in cognitive improvements in PD [22]. The diet mainly consists of meat, fish, poultry, low-carb vegetables, coconut oil, and avocados, representing nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins A, D, and B complex. The LCHF/KD has been used to generate blood ketones, improve neuronal cell energy and efficiency in brain neurochemistry, and produce anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [23].",c1cc4303-1498-4ed4-a1d2-efa33ee32c80
3,discussion3," Furthermore, clinical research studies on ketones have reported the production of blood ketones as a result of either an LCHF/KD or exogenous ketone salts or ketone esters, resulting in improved cognitive function, amelioration of symptoms in PD related to dopamine deficits, improved pain and mood, and reductions in urinary frequency [24].  Since the LCHF/KD is known to mimic fasting through the production of blood ketones, nutritional ketosis created by the diet can improve insulin sensitivity, increase supplies of brain neurotransmitters and other metabolic precursors for synaptogenesis, and reduce apoptosis [18]. According to Krikorian et al. (2019), ketone levels were positively correlated with performance on memory tests along with improvements in waist measurements, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin [23]. These results are consistent with our findings.",b24ac428-f3b8-4823-9ca9-b00727152ccb
4,discussion4," An increase in blood ketones and reduction in other biomarkers and hypothesized changes in the participant's symptoms may account for our participant's reported improvement in behavior and mood, decreases in symptoms of both anxiety and depression, and improved cognition during the 24-week intervention.  Some of the limitations of this case report include the small sample size (n=1), non-generalizable results with a lack of statistical analysis, possible placebo effect that may have influenced participant responses, and the potential effects of weight loss that may cloud the interpretation of the effects of the dietary intervention on PD symptoms. Nutritional studies have inherent issues related to the validity of food tracking and the veracity of dietary compliance. This case report attempted to control for these variables with daily food tracking by using a widely used daily food tracking app (MyFitnessPal) and home blood glucose/ketone testing.",b4425ae2-d799-4230-8a10-1086201f221d
5,discussion5,"  Conclusions  The implications of the use of dietary interventions in PD can be significant. In the face of rising healthcare costs, improving outcomes for patients with PD through a nutritional approach when medications may not offer sustained improvements or control of symptoms can provide a more natural method for symptoms management and enhance the quality of life. Empowering individuals with PD through a more personalized nutritional approach to symptom management can be achieved by offering adjuvant treatment approaches together with medication therapy to reduce symptoms and improve function. The results of this case study (n=1) demonstrate the need for more randomized clinical trials to further test the effectiveness of the LCHF/KD in improving cognitive function and controlling or reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and both motor and nonmotor symptoms in PD.",23e25e1d-9e32-499d-bacb-22875df8dd41
