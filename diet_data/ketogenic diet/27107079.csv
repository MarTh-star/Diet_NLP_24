0,background0,"Epilepsy is a condition whereby individuals are prone to recurrent epileptic seizures, a change in behaviour or movement that is the direct result of a primary change in the electrical activity in the brain. It is not a single condition – there are many different underlying causes and, more accurately, they should be referred to as the epilepsies. Up to 65% of individuals with epilepsy will have seizures controlled with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or enter spontaneous remission in their lifetime [1]. However, this leaves 35% who will continue with seizures despite treatment. Standard first-line management of an individual presenting with epilepsy is antiepileptic medication, decided on the basis of the type of epilepsy. Although guidelines exist on which drug to use, management is still based on a ‘trial and error’ approach [2]. When the type of epilepsy or seizure is unclear, it can be difficult to optimise treatment at the outset.",acf001ea-954a-4183-9174-c2113da504c9
1,background1,"  The incidence of epilepsy is greatest in the first 2 years of life (56–88/100,000 children/year), [3] a population who remain most at risk for neurodevelopmental compromise in the longer term. Early control of seizures is associated with better developmental outcome [4] but, unfortunately, many of the epilepsies presenting in infancy are associated with a poor prognosis for seizure control [5, 6]. Little evidence is available with regard to effective treatments and, even where seizure freedom is achieved, this is unlikely to be sustained long term [7]. This group of children place a large burden on health services, with a need for regular clinical review and ongoing medication, as well as clinical and therapy support. This is especially true for those who remain resistant to medication, this group being amongst the most costly for medical and care services long term. It is, therefore, imperative that all other treatment options are explored as early as possible [8].",1c462726-0c79-44a5-a144-492171fcae25
2,background2,"  The epilepsies in this age group also remain poorly defined entities; very few can be classified into an epilepsy syndrome and diagnosis of underlying cause remains difficult. Over 50% of infants presenting with seizures will have infantile spasms [3]. This affects approximately 1 in 2000 infants. First-line treatment options (corticosteroids or vigabatrin) lead to seizure freedom in up to 70% of cases [9] but side effects limit their duration of use and relapse rates are substantial (40%) [10]. Further, those who fail these treatments are limited in their treatment options. Of the remaining types of epilepsy, the majority are resistant to medication. There is little evidence on which to base our decisions on specific AED use in this young age group. Epidemiological data have shown this group to be the least likely to achieve longer-term remission of up to 2 years [11].",e1d8753d-073d-4ad9-8e43-77e8f23655bd
3,background3,"  The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet designed to mimic the effects of starvation on the body. The main energy intake is fat, which is converted to ketones in the body and used as an energy source. The classical KD is based on an intake of long-chain fat, usually in a ratio of 3 or 4 g of fat to 1 g of carbohydrate and protein. The medium-chain triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) KD utilises medium chain triglyceride (MCT) fat, which generates more ketones per calorie compared to long-chain fat, theoretically allowing greater dietary intake of carbohydrate. More liberal diets have also been utilised, including the Modified Atkins Diet and low-glycaemic-index treatment, which are high in fat, low in carbohydrate but with unlimited protein [12, 13].  The KD has been shown to be successful in controlling seizures in many observational studies [14, 15].",5058ab1a-f0a6-4b6c-bbad-90821313c8f1
4,background4," However, there is limited evidence examining efficacy against no change or alternative treatments from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) [16]. The first RCT of the KD to demonstrate effectiveness in children aged 2–16 years was published in 2008 [17]. In this trial, 145 children aged 2–16 years, who had failed at least two AEDs and had at least seven seizures weekly, were randomised to receive a KD, either immediately or after a 3-month delay with no additional treatment changes (the latter being the control group). After 3 months, the mean percentage of baseline seizures (on an intention-to-treat analysis) was significantly lower in the diet group (62%) than in controls (137%, p < 0.0001). Twenty-eight (38%) of the diet group had greater than 50% seizure reduction, compared to four (6%) controls (p < 0.0001). One further RCT of similar design and in the same age group has been reported demonstrating efficacy of the Modified Atkins Diet to a similar degree [13].",e39504b2-8600-4c18-bbc6-c4584b0cb766
5,background5," There has been no RCT assessing treatment with the KD in children under the age of 2 years.  Open-label, observational evidence indicates that the KD could be particularly effective in younger children. Open-label studies have suggested it to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for infants [12, 18–26]. One study reported significant improvements in infantile spasms and fewer side effects when the diet was used as an alternative first-line therapy to adrenocorticotrophic hormone (adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)) [27].  The mechanism of action of the KD is not yet known. Recent evidence suggests that medium-chain fatty acids, more specifically decanoic acid, may have a specific role in its antiepileptic effect [28–30]. These data raise the possibility that C10 alone has the ability to mimic aspects of the KD. Whether this has a role in a possibly enhanced action of the KD in infancy should be determined and the biochemical basis for effectiveness identified [31, 32].",a945293e-4f47-4861-8c31-645d6f7f6dcc
6,background6,"  The KD is a high-resource treatment, requiring patient-specific calculation and regular input from a specialist paediatrician and dietitian, with close monitoring thereafter. It also requires diligence on the part of the families. It is also not without side effects. It is imperative that the effectiveness and safety of the KD in this very young age group is now studied in a well-designed clinical trial.  Study objectives The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of the KD compared to AEDs in the treatment of infants with epilepsy aged 3 months to 2 years of age who continue to have seizures despite previous trials of two AEDs. The secondary objectives are to determine tolerability of the KD relative to standard AEDs, adherence to treatment over time, the effect on quality of life and neurobehavioural progress. Further, we aim to estimate whether the presence of medium-chain fatty acids in the context of use of the KD is associated with seizure control.",0ac8a0c9-f7a7-4aa1-af7d-1b55fc97db76
7,background7,"  Methods/design The project proposed is an open-label, randomised controlled, multicentre clinical trial of children aged 3 months to 2 years of age with epilepsy who have failed to respond to two or more pharmacological treatments (AED or corticosteroids), comparing KD to further AED treatment. The study will be conducted in two phases: first, we will carry out a pilot phase in two centres. If the pilot study recruits successfully, we will proceed to the full trial in a further seven centres. See Additional file 1 for a schematic of the trial design.  Eligible children will be consented via their parents. They will undergo baseline assessment including medical and seizure history, neurological and anthropometric examination, administration of quality of life (Infant and Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire, [33]) and developmental (Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Questionnaire, [34]) questionnaires and biochemical investigations.",6a91347e-41f8-485b-9557-ffe2303cd77c
8,background8," They will then start a 2-week observation period with documentation of seizure frequency. If the child is prone to particularly frequent seizures in excess of two per day, then a minimum baseline period of 1 week would be considered sufficient. Food diaries required for diet calculation will be returned by post from all enrolled infants 1 week (or sooner for those with an unstable clinical condition) into the observation period. Standardised seizure records will be kept during the observation period and throughout the trial. Randomisation will be conducted using an Internet randomisation system provided by Sealed Envelope™ (Sealed Envelope Ltd.). Randomisation will occur on day 8 or day 15 for participants to receive the KD or a further AED; the allocated treatment will commence following randomisation, with instruction and training.  The randomisation schedule will be independently generated and held by Sealed Envelope™.",60c7265f-8ff1-4d6a-a2d8-04711f05aa8f
9,background9," Allocations will be released by email to the coordinating centres once the investigator or research nurse has entered eligible participant information into the web-based randomisation service. Participants will be allocated to either the KD or further AED arm using a simple, concealed, randomisation method. Randomisation will aim to achieve 92 in the KD group versus 68 participants in the further AED arm (see calculation in ‘Sample size’ section). An Enrollment Log will be maintained to keep records of the screened and randomised patients at each site. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced and replacement numbers will not be issued. Whilst it will not be possible to blind participants to their treatment allocation, efforts will be made to minimise expectation bias by emphasising in the trial literature that the evidence supporting the KD for seizure control is currently limited.",44965e5f-c206-42fe-99a4-04bdacaf1bee
10,background10,"  A second assessment (4 weeks after start of treatment) will include clinical review and a tolerability questionnaire (modified Hague Scale of Side Effects – see Additional file 2). Assessments will be repeated at 8 weeks after the start of treatment including clinical review, administration of the Infant and Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire, the tolerability questionnaire, and biochemical investigations. After the 8-week assessment, according to patient’s clinical response to treatment with regards seizure outcome and tolerability, the KD (diet group) or AED (standard AED group) will then be continued or changed. Those in the AED group who have failed to achieve seizure control at the 8-week assessment will then be offered the KD outside the context of the trial. Those on the KD who have failed to achieve seizure improvement at the 8-week assessment will continue with medical management, as per clinician decision.",34d8db43-fca4-49cc-81f8-8377df4d6027

Children allocated to KD therapy will have their diets individually calculated by a paediatric dietitian with consideration of daily calorie requirements, adequate protein intake for growth and vitamin and mineral supplementation. All diets will be implemented according to a classical KD protocol, i.e. based on a ratio of fat to carbohydrate and protein that will usually be between 2:1 and 4:1. In order to achieve a state of ketosis, meal plans have to be accurately calculated for each child individually and recorded in the patient’s medical notes.",6fa282f8-a1e4-4a1b-b570-0b56fa09e2aa

Hospital stays will be determined by the clinical team at the treating centre, utilising the ‘Trial Intervention Manual’. A non-fasting initiation protocol will be used for all children. Parents or carers will attend a teaching session prior to diet commencement, including how to manage possible early side effects, such as excess ketosis and hypoglycaemia. Teaching of families in the KD arm will occur following randomisation and prior to starting the diet.

27,discussion0,"We summarise here the protocol of an open-label RCT, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the KD in children with epilepsy under the age of 2 years who have failed two AEDs, compared to standard AED treatment. We hypothesise that the KD is more effective in reducing seizure frequency in infants (age 3 months to 2 years) with epilepsy who have failed to respond to two or more pharmacological agents (AED or corticosteroids) compared to conventional management with an AED.  There is genuine equipoise between the two treatment groups. There is little evidence on the effectiveness of treatments in children with epilepsy under 2 years of age, in particular comparative evidence. The most common seizure type to present in infancy is infantile spasms, for which there is evidence on first-line treatment [9]; there is no RCT-derived evidence on which treatment to use should either steroids or vigabatrin fail.",e03bbf3d-8e53-4bf5-9fe7-8f0e74277b2c
28,discussion1," Further, there is little evidence in other seizure types or syndromes in this age group. There is, therefore, a need to determine whether KD treatment or standard drug treatment should be utilised early in the natural history of the condition. Information on the effectiveness of the KD in the treatment of younger children is limited to the results of open-label, non-randomised and non-prospective studies. Further, numbers are small, children are reported only at the severe end of the spectrum and, in some, the diet is trialled in preference to conventional antiepileptic medication known to be beneficial [27]. The results from the trial in the older children [17], although still showing the diet to be effective, did not show this to the same degree as in the reported open studies. It is important to determine the place of the KD in this younger group of patients, both with regard to effectiveness and safety, considering the resource required and vulnerability of the group.",5d861ac5-b95c-4de0-9255-8edf1f1e2313
29,discussion2,"  Some concern could be expressed about the duration of the trial at only 8 weeks to primary outcome; many studies utilise a 3-month assessment period, and the KD can take a while to introduce and fine tune. In the group of children to be assessed, namely children under the age of 2 years, many epilepsy syndromes are characterised by a high frequency of seizures. Further, many AEDs have a high rate of clearance in this age group. Indeed, a relatively high seizure frequency may preclude recruitment in view of the concern about a 2-week baseline. Our pilot data from previous trials and continuing work in our KD research clinics strongly suggest that seizure response to either the KD or usual AEDs is determined in the infant population by 4 weeks. Previous AED studies in this age group have also utilised a 1-day to 4-week titration period and a 4-day to 4-week stabilisation period [38–40].",38e397c7-8d36-4587-884e-f948b4bedaf8
30,discussion3," The balance is between the likely time required to determine failure of the AED and the time required to establish a child on the KD. Eight weeks allows a 4–6 week titration for establishing the KD or an AED, with at least 2 weeks’ stability for seizure assessment.
