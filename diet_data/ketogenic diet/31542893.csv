0,abstract0," The ketogenic diet (KD) has been successfully used for a century for treating refractory epilepsy and is currently seen as one of the few viable approaches to the treatment of a plethora of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Empirical evidence notwithstanding, there is still no universal understanding of KD mechanism(s). An important fact is that the brain is capable of using ketone bodies for fuel. Another critical point is that glucose’s functions span beyond its role as an energy substrate, and in most of these functions, glucose is irreplaceable. By acting as a supplementary fuel, ketone bodies may free up glucose for its other crucial and exclusive function. We propose that this glucose-sparing effect of ketone bodies may underlie the effectiveness of KD in epilepsy and major neurodegenerative diseases, which are all characterized by brain glucose hypometabolism.",235ccdce-a2b2-4a0d-bb19-6322f3f98dfa
1,abstract1,"  aerobic glycolysis antioxidant system glucose metabolism glycogen ketogenic diet ketosis cover-dateNovember/December 2020 ==== Body Significance Statement  The ketogenic diet (KD) was created in the 1920s as a therapy for refractory epilepsy. Since then, evidence accumulated showing its potential for other major neurodegenerative disorders. The exact mechanism of KD’s protective activity still remains unknown, nonetheless. In the brain, ketone bodies can be used for cellular energy, at least partially substituting glucose as brain fuel. However, glucose has essential functions beyond those of just energy supply that cannot be provided by alternative substrates. We propose that the glucose-sparing effect of ketone bodies may underlie the effectiveness of KD in epilepsy and other major neurodegenerative diseases which are all characterized by brain glucose hypometabolism. ",1a7d03b6-89eb-46d6-908d-5a6f5487135b
2,introduction0," There is no universally accepted definition of ketogenic diets (KDs). Moreover, there is a tendency to relax previous quantitative criteria (Zilberter and Zilberter, 2018) introduced almost a century ago (Wilder and Winter, 1922) that were based on macronutrient composition. Perhaps the most practical notion of whether a diet can be considered to be ketogenic is made by Seyfried (2012): it is “as long as the individual has reduced blood glucose and is producing ketones.” Although protein is included in the ketogenic ratio equation (Shaffer, 1921), glucose, ketone bodies, and their interplay determine the dominating metabolic mode: whether the predominant energy supply is glucose or ketone bodies . The current data allow us to conclude that the functional interaction between glucose and ketone bodies is not a binary winner-take-all process. Here, we attempt to describe more intricate relationships between them.",00c1b968-7aeb-4355-b68a-827b6b730012
3,introduction1,"  Glycolytic ATP Production  In the case of acute energy demand such as during intense network activity, the brain is able to intensify glycolytic ATP production for rapid supply. Aerobic glycolysis (when glucose is partially converted to lactate in the presence of oxygen, producing two ATP molecules) is disproportionate to the oxygen consumption of glucose utilization when the oxygen delivery is adequate (Dienel and Cruz, 2016). In the resting brain, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation rates appear well-matched, indicating nearly complete oxidation of glucose. However, in the activated brain at physiological conditions, e.g., during sensory stimulation and mental testing, aerobic glycolysis has been observed in various brain regions (Dienel and Cruz, 2016; Dienel, 2019a). The cellular contribution to aerobic glycolysis is yet unclear and is a matter of debate (Dienel and Cruz, 2016; Barros et al., 2020).",29793a05-9631-4401-bc11-83afdee073e6
4,introduction2," As lactate (in addition to pyruvate) is the end-product of the glycolytic pathway during aerobic glycolysis, it can either be cleared out from the brain or partially consumed as supplementary fuel for neurons (Pellerin and Magistretti, 2012; Dienel and Cruz, 2016). Indeed, aerobic glycolysis as an ATP production mechanism, while low-capacity, is rapid, ensuring fast ATP resupply in neurons where the dynamic demand for energy is highest (Yellen, 2018). The notion of fast ATP synthesis (aerobic glycolysis) is supported by an immediate rise in extracellular lactate and reduction in glucose levels during brief visual stimulation coincident with spiking activity (Li and Freeman, 2015).  Neurons are rich in mitochondria, a major source of ATP . However, for some of the neuronal functions, aerobic glycolysis may be the preferential method of fuel generation, for instance, for fast axonal vesicle transport .",6845570b-e1dc-4d97-9b90-21f653c02518
5,introduction3," Although synaptic transmission is a very energy-demanding process, many presynaptic nerve terminals lack mitochondria (Devine and Kittler, 2018; Tourigny et al., 2019), although mitochondria can migrate to and/or ATP can diffuse into the presynaptic boutons during enhanced synaptic activity (Chamberlain and Sheng, 2019; Rossi and Pekkurnaz, 2019). Recent studies indicate that presynaptic transmission is dependent on activity-induced glycolysis (Ashrafi and Ryan, 2017), while presynapses can use ATP produced by both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to sustain neurotransmission (Ashrafi and Ryan, 2017; Chamberlain and Sheng, 2019; Rossi and Pekkurnaz, 2019). Moreover, dendritic spines that receive most excitatory synaptic inputs have been shown to contain no mitochondria , despite being sites of intense energy utilization.",c30163bb-7cc3-4cc4-9309-164a243475e0
6,introduction4," Although some ATP might diffuse to spine heads from nearby dendritic mitochondria, it is conceivable that spines are reliant on glycolysis instead . Glycolytic ATP alone, with its limited production capacity, is unlikely to be sufficient to power ion pumping required for the maintenance of ion gradient and membrane potential , but it may nevertheless play an important role in fast refueling. For instance, the preferential role of glycolytic energy supply was demonstrated for Na/K-ATPase in fast-twitch skeletal muscle  and cardiac Purkinje cells (Glitsch and Tappe, 1993). Aerobic glycolysis during KD has not been studied yet. However, unlike glucose, ketones cannot be involved in aerobic glycolysis, and thus they contribute to ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation only .",80b5c305-027d-4971-a27a-3c77767e8649
7,introduction5,"  The Cytoplasmic Antioxidant System  Reactive oxygen species (Reactive oxygen species (ROS)) in brain cells originate from multiple sources and most of them are generated as byproducts of metabolic reactions. Intracellular Reactive oxygen species (ROS) come mainly from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)), xanthine oxidase, nitric oxide synthase, and mitochondria. nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) is the only enzyme with the primary function of generating Reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Bedard and Krause, 2007; Koju et al., 2019) that are mostly used for the “host defense” (e.g., microbial killing) in organisms. nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) enzymes are predominantly expressed in the cellular plasma membrane .",abe4ae6b-6d93-461f-8374-16f61a6f0c52
8,introduction6," The enzyme consists of a membrane-bound catalytic core and several cytosolic regulatory subunits (Bedard and Krause, 2007). There are seven known isoforms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)1, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)2, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)4 expressed in multiple brain regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, hypothalamus, midbrain, and/or striatum . These nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) variants are the most prominent isoforms detected in a variety of brain cell types (Cahill-Smith and Li, 2014; Rastogi et al., 2016; Hou et al., 2020), with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)2 the dominant form expressed by microglia, neurons, and astrocytes.",75958ca8-f66e-4dc7-a65d-bec59e636da4
9,introduction7," Activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) results in an increase of extracellular H2O2 levels followed by H2O2 entry into the cells via aquaporins (Bienert and Chaumont, 2014). Under “resting conditions” in the brain, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) is normally dormant and therefore its contribution to the total cellular Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production under resting or physiological conditions is not clear (Brown and Borutaite, 2012). In pathology, when nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) is activated by specific stimulation , its cytosolic subunits translocate to the membrane and associate to the functioning complex. Under these conditions, mitochondria and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) are the major Reactive oxygen species (ROS) producers (Tarafdar and Pula, 2018; Barua et al., 2019).",1c22f571-22bb-44f1-b074-cfff16240083
10,introduction8," However, before its diffusion to the cytoplasm, the internal consumption of H2O2 in mitochondria is much higher than originally anticipated (Munro and Pamenter, 2019) and during oxidative stress, mitochondria may be victims rather than producers of oxidative damage (Gandhi and Abramov, 2012). Indeed, in AD models, the effects of mitochondrial Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were found to be much smaller compared with those of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)-produced Reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Angelova and Abramov, 2018).  In the cytoplasm, an efficient anti-oxidative system based largely on the glycolysis-associated pentose-phosphate pathway strictly regulates Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels to avoid any oxidative injury (Bolaños and Almeida, 2010; Franco et al., 2019; Cherkas et al., 2020). Thus, brain cells use glucose as an energy provider as well as the substrate for cytoplasmic Reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification mechanisms.",761738c6-6028-4277-b018-860a0a26d53d
11,introduction9," The combination of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction with inadequate antioxidant defenses (such as when glucose utilization is inhibited) results in oxidative stress and consequent damages, e.g., neural cell death and neurodegeneration (Avery, 2011; Tarafdar and Pula, 2018).  An extreme example of the importance of glucose-based antioxidant defense for cellular function was reported by us when glucose in artificial CSF (artificial CSF (ACSF)) was exchanged for pyruvate in hippocampal slices (Malkov et al., 2014, 2019). The substitution resulted in oxidative stress leading to massive network depolarization (analogous to spreading depression; Pietrobon and Moskowitz, 2014) together with a “metabolic collapse.” Importantly, we obtained similar results replacing glucose with other mitochondrial fuels such as lactate or β-hydroxybutyrate (unpublished), indicating again the unique importance of glucose.",4401157e-bb0d-4430-b098-f6b1c633665e
12,introduction10,"  KD improves antioxidant defense by stimulating the endogenous antioxidant system. Mild oxidative stress following KD onset drives nuclear translocation of transcription factor Nrf2, leading to increased synthesis of glutathione which is one of the major components of the antioxidant defense (Pinto et al., 2018; Camberos-Luna and Massieu, 2020).  Glycogen Production in Astrocytes  The major energy reserve in the brain is glycogen, a macromolecular storage form of glucose (Dienel, 2019b). Found mostly in astrocytes (Dienel and Carlson, 2019; neurons can store less significant amounts; Saez et al., 2014), glycogen is a dynamic participant in brain activity and is regulated by neurotransmitters. Dysregulation of glycogen turnover may cause severe consequences, e.g., Lafora disease with progressive neurodegeneration and epilepsy leading to death in early adulthood .",498991b0-8928-4eeb-860c-b350eb0b106b
13,introduction11," During intense brain activity, glycogen converted to lactate and released from astrocytes can be used by neurons as mitochondrial fuel. Meanwhile, rapid glycogenolytic generation of ATP may be important for astrocytic energy demands (Dienel and Rothman, 2019), and thus glycogenolysis, by reducing the astrocytic requirement for blood-borne glucose, can spare an equivalent amount of glucose for neuronal utilization (Dienel, 2019a; DiNuzzo et al., 2019). The estimated glucose equivalent of glycogen concentration in astrocytes is up to 40–100 mM. Considering the high rate of glycogenolysis, the amount of glucose that can be released via glycogen breakdown is very significant (Dienel, 2019a; DiNuzzo et al., 2019). Unfortunately, glycogen levels in the human brain during KD have yet to be investigated. In rats, one study reported increased inbound glucose (reflecting glycogen content; DeVivo et al.",7420afe9-ebe5-4ff5-9080-d258a1ef1f4b
14,introduction12,", 1978) under KD, while no change in glycogen content was found in another study (Al-Mudallal et al., 1995) or glycogen was decreased . Carbohydrate intake does not affect brain glycogen content, while in both muscle and liver it does significantly correlate with glycogen levels .  Production of Major Neurotransmitters  Glucose fuels de novo synthesis of major neurotransmitters. Precursors for glutamate or GABA are synthesized by astrocytes and then transferred to neurons in the glutamine–glutamate/GABA cycle (Dienel, 2019a). The transmitters released during synaptic activity are transported back to astrocytes, where a fraction (∼25%) is degraded with the remainder released and reused by the neurons. The process is very intense, consuming up to 75% of the entire glucose consumption in the cortex (Schousboe et al., 2013; Hertz and Rothman, 2016).",24a5417a-155d-4637-96df-5c52b7a7835b
15,introduction13," Glucose metabolism is required for the synthesis of glutamate from glutamine in glutamatergic neurons (Bak et al., 2006; Lund et al., 2009; Chowdhury et al., 2014; Hertz and Rothman, 2016), but in GABAergic neurons, β-hydroxybutyrate is capable of replacing glucose for GABA production (Hertz and Rothman, 2016).  Glucose Utilization in the Brain during Ketosis  The KD is an efficient clinical treatment used for over a century to decrease brain hyperexcitability and seizures via a yet unclear mechanism. Carbohydrate limitation in KD led to a popular notion that glycolysis inhibition may partially reproduce the effects of KD. However, this hypothesis ignores the important fact that glycolysis inhibition a priori results in energy deprivation; meanwhile, no energy deficiency occurs under KD [in rats on KD, the brain ATP level was found either unchanged (Al-Mudallal et al., 1996; Bough et al., 2006) or increased ].",2d83972f-51cf-4188-9e60-7b42d94c7ea0
16,introduction14," However, do ketones inhibit glycolysis [as, for instance, does 2-deoxy-d-glucose  or iodoacetate (Schmidt and Dringen, 2009)] or do they just compete with glucose as mitochondrial fuel? The NMR study of Valente-Silva et al. (2015) is often cited as evidence of glycolysis inhibition. There are a number of important flaws in this study, however: (1) the 400-μm-thick brain slices were superfused with oxygenated artificial CSF (ACSF) at 3 ml/min rate that results in anoxic conditions within the tissue (Ivanov and Zilberter, 2011), making oxidative phosphorylation impossible; and (2) the authors used 4-AP to induce network activity, while epileptiform activity induced by 4-AP was itself shown to be a strong inhibitor of glycolysis . To the best of our knowledge, there are no other reports on ketones’ direct inhibitory action on glycolysis.  There have been many attempts to estimate brain glucose utilization under KD, with variable results.",079ecfdf-b70d-49d9-8a19-057c8887c1b9
17,introduction15," In awake animals, glucose utilization either increased , did not change (Al-Mudallal et al., 1995) or decreased , while brain glucose levels either increased , did not change  or decreased . Utilization of the fluorodeoxyglucose (18F)-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) technique in animals requires anesthesia that introduces a brain state quite different from an awake one. Nevertheless, under anesthesia, glucose utilization either increased , remained unchanged , or decreased . The variability of the results may be explained by the presence of confounding factors such as, e.g., the use of anesthesia, significant age difference and the relatively high interindividual variation in plasma ketones during KD .",20619ed1-59ee-49b5-b79a-dad748767223
18,introduction16,"  Interestingly, in healthy young/middle age humans, cerebral glucose utilization evaluated by arteriovenous difference was decreased under acute hyperketonemia (a blood infusion of β-hydroxybutyrate; Hasselbalch et al., 1996) or following 3 d of fasting . Recent studies using the FDG-PET technique confirmed these results reporting decreased brain glucose utilization in healthy humans under KD (Courchesne-Loyer et al., 2017) or acute hyperketonemia . Importantly and however, similar recordings during ketogenic intervention in humans suffering mild cognitive impairment  or mild-moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Croteau et al., 2018b) revealed no change in brain glucose utilization, while brain ketone metabolism was found to be normal (Castellano et al., 2015; Croteau et al., 2018a). Notably, glucose hypometabolism is a hallmark of AD pathogenesis (Caminiti et al., 2018; Gordon et al.",e6af4654-f3b6-4cdc-9fc8-5f5c8a014761
19,introduction17,", 2018; Butterfield and Halliwell, 2019). Indeed, disrupted glucose metabolism associated with oxidative stress is the common feature of major neurodegenerative diseases (Zilberter and Zilberter, 2017; Cunnane et al., 2020; Tang, 2020) and epilepsy (Pearson-Smith and Patel, 2017; Zilberter and Zilberter, 2017; Patel, 2018). For instance, AD pathology occurs well before (up to two decades prior) the onset of clinical symptoms (Caminiti et al., 2018; Gordon et al., 2018; Butterfield and Halliwell, 2019) with dysfunctional glucose metabolism as one earliest manifestation. In human epilepsy, clinical tests using FDG-PET imaging have established that decreased brain glucose utilization during quiescent (interictal) periods is a widely recognized biomarker of epileptogenesis (Sarikaya, 2015; Lotan et al., 2020).",86eca256-6bc7-447b-ae0a-bd680380902e
20,introduction18," Since glucose utilization underlies vital brain functions such as energy supply and antioxidant defense (see above), it is not surprising that disturbances in glucose metabolism can lead to a chain of harmful consequences, and thus likely represent a major underlying cause of disease initiation and progression (Pearson-Smith and Patel, 2017; Zilberter and Zilberter, 2017; Butterfield and Halliwell, 2019). Therefore, as also suggested previously (Cunnane et al., 2016a; Croteau et al., 2018b), it is logical to conclude that in a normal brain, where glucose can fully cover energy needs, the addition of ketones as mitochondrial fuel competitors reduces the need for a part of glucose function and the total glucose utilization goes down. In pathology, when glucose utilization is impaired leading to energy deficiency, ketone bodies compensate at least partially this energy gap, leaving more glucose available for its other vital functions such as mentioned above.",7abe04eb-c834-41d4-a881-63b66157fc86
21,introduction19,"  In fact, the glucose-sparing effect may be dominant in ketone’s beneficial therapeutic function ensemble. Clinical effects of KD are mostly known regarding epilepsy as childhood epilepsy has been successfully treated with KD since the 1920s (Wilder, 1921). Recently, however, the KD began to be used in preclinical studies of other disorders, including neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and brain injury (McDonald and Cervenka, 2018; Camberos-Luna and Massieu, 2020; Kraeuter et al., 2020), demonstrating promising efficiency that has also been confirmed in clinical trials in mild cognitive impairment, AD, and Parkinson’s disease patients (for review, see Cunnane et al., 2020). Meanwhile, it has been noted that the efficacy of KD in an array of disorders with distinct pathophysiologies may indicate shared underlying pathologic mechanisms .",f39ba4f5-3e55-4ddd-bbd4-3a26720c37ba
22,introduction20," In the case of major neurodegenerative diseases, one such mechanism is glucose hypometabolism (Zilberter and Zilberter, 2017; Cunnane et al., 2020; Tang, 2020). Definitely, impaired glucose metabolism may lead to energy deficiency that ketones can partially compensate by boosting mitochondrial oxidation. Here, it is interesting to note that in the case of early AD stages, neither cerebral oxygen consumption (Hoyer et al., 1988; Hoyer, 1992) nor mitochondrial ability for ketone utilization changed (Castellano et al., 2015; Croteau et al., 2018a), suggesting normal mitochondrial functioning (Cunnane et al., 2016b, 2020), despite pronounced glucose hypometabolism. Indeed, we demonstrated recently in hippocampal slices that amyloid-β  as well as epileptiform activity  strongly inhibited glycolysis while mitochondrial function remained normal or even upregulated, potentially as a compensatory mechanism.",bffa04c4-a6fa-46e6-8525-be6f7ee16bfe
23,introduction21," This therefore suggests that glucose metabolism deficiency mostly affects functions not related to oxidative phosphorylation and thus ketones possibly leave more glucose available for other vital functions (Fig. 1) that may be especially important for the therapeutic effects of KD. The potential importance of the glucose-sparing effect of ketones has been noted previously in reports considering neurodegenerative diseases (Cunnane et al., 2016a, 2020).  Figure 1. Roles of glucose and ketone bodies in brain cells: parallel, converging, and exclusive. Red: ketone bodies’ pathway to mitochondria. Blue: glucose pathway to mitochondria. Purple: the point of convergence. Green: exclusive roles of glucose.  Conclusions  Glucose does not share some of its functions in the brain with other metabolic substrates, which makes it an exclusive neurometabolite.",ec4d8b6f-c8f8-4e21-ab81-1c5488f3a658
24,introduction22," The frequent claim that ketones directly inhibit the process of glycolysis is not supported by experimental evidence and seems theoretically unlikely. Moreover, glycolysis inhibition modifies a number of cellular functions that lead to unpredictable variations of network excitability, and in the long-run has been shown to result in epileptogenesis (Samokhina et al., 2017, 2020). In pathology, ketones are capable of partially taking over the glucose’s energy fuel role in mitochondria and presumably spare glucose for its other exclusive functions. Here, we summarized the evidence and offer a non-antagonistic view of the ketone bodies-glucose interplay during metabolic shifting. The glucose-sparing effect of ketone bodies may determine the efficiency of the ketogenic regime and is especially important in epilepsy and major neurodegenerative diseases characterized by significantly impaired brain glucose utilization.",5d76f1b7-eede-4235-aa19-93dd2beb6d97

This issue is discussed in detail in a comprehensive review of Hertz and Rothman (Hertz and Rothman, 2016). In short, both glutamate and GABA are produced from glutamine delivered by astrocytes. In glutamatergic neurons, all glutamate formed from glutamine first enters mitochondria and then is returned to cytosol in a complex process, which requires simultaneous glucose metabolism.",e0f3694c-eb60-45b3-b916-b603a6143af6
33,introduction31," In GABAergic neurons, a part of GABA is formed directly in cytosol from glutamine-produced glutamate, while the production of another part from mitochondria-delivered glutamate requires acetyl CoA, which can be supplied by either glucose or β -hydroxybutyrate. This makes the GABA synthesis much less sensitive to the replacement of glucose with  β-hydroxybutyrate than the synthesis of glutamate. The reference is included in the text.  - Also, why is the following paragraph added to the paragraph of neurotransmitters? “while measurements in awake rats suggested that only about 50% of active brain’s energy requirements can be supplemented by β-hydroxybutyrate even at saturating plasma concentrations (17mM) -- the rest has to derive from glucose oxidation . The last conclusion was also confirmed in long-lasting-fasted humans  and in rats on the ketogenic diet (Zhang et al., 2013a).”  This text has been removed.",c2f8afbb-192c-4338-83c3-4bdacf69d68f
34,introduction32,"  - In the next paragraph, (5) glucose utilization in the brain during ketosis, the authors state “there is no energy deficiency during KD”. How is this argument congruent with the beforementioned paragraph that only 50% of the brain’s energy requirements can be supplemented by ketones?  The references confirming the statement “there is no energy deficiency during KD” are inserted in the new text. Ketones are able to substitute glucose efficiently in mitochondria but they cannot substitute ATP generated in aerobic glycolysis. During KD, however, both ketones and glucose present in the brain that presumably maintains aerobic glycolysis efficient enough.  - Are there important flows or flaws in the Valente-Silva et al study?  Corrected.  - “In awake animals, glucose utilization either did not change (al-Mudallal et al., 1995) or increased , while brain glucose levels did not change  or decreased ”.",d7a2378c-2f7f-411c-9089-a116f683c2f9
35,introduction33," Yudkoff et al (2015) showed lower plasma glucose levels in KD and argue that “label in 1-13C glucose and 13C lactate were higher in ketotic animals reflecting the fact that the isotope was administered into a peripheral blood glucose pool that is lower in the experimental group.” They did, however, not conclude that brain glucose utilization is higher perse.  We agree with your remark. Note, however, that in Table 3, both brain glucose and lactate are increased in ketotic animals, and the lactate increase is problematic to interpret otherwise than the result of enhanced glycolysis.  - Glucose utilization increased in the study of Roy et al (2012) were performed in aged animals using PET FDG, whereas the other studies cited in the same sentence were done in normally aged rats using PET (LaManna et al, 2009; Zhang et al, 2013b) or using mass spectrometry (Zhang et al, 2013a).",85745266-2b01-45f8-b939-c9847319ef06
36,introduction34," Could the authors provide more details to the studies summed up in one sentence? The age and methods used likely very much influence the findings. That is, both PET studies in young rats confirmed decreased glucose uptake in KD.  This is correct and the text has been modified accordingly.  - Why is a 20% glucose reduction considered small after a 4-day KD? (re: “only”?)  Corrected.  - Why is it “most likely” that ketones’ substitution of glucose in mitochondria spares glucose for vital functions such as antioxidant defense and fast glycolytic ATP production? I don’t see good arguments for this. Which decrease in glucose utilization would you expect for the inhibition of glycolysis?  The text has been modified considerably for making our hypothesis more clear and substantiated.",77bf4b17-7986-4c7c-9ffb-8d1c4069a066
37,introduction35," We have included the human data indicating that under ketogenic intervention the brain glucose utilization goes down but only in healthy recipients, while it is unchanged in patients with AD pathology characterized by pronounced glucose hypometabolism.
