0,methods0," Cachexia Model and Lung Tumor Induction  KrasG12D/+;Lkb1f/f mice have been previously described (11). Mice were housed in a 12-h light/dark cycle and 22°C ambient temperature and had free access to normal chow (PicoLab Rodent 20 5053; Lab Diet) and drinking water. Tumors were induced in adult (12- to 20-wk-old) male and female mice via intranasal administration of 75 μL of PBS containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 2.5 × 10 (7) pfu of Adenovirus CMV-Cre (Ad5CMV-Cre) purchased from the University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core (Iowa City, IA). A detailed description of the cachectic phenotype in these mice, its time-course, and its severity have been published previously (5). Briefly, the animals develop a cachectic phenotype that comprises progressive atrophy in type II myofibers, reduced muscle and total body mass, and worsened spontaneous and forced activity about 6 weeks after tumor induction.",22ca719a-c12d-43de-a8af-57fbb9fb67e1
1,methods1," The duration of the cohorts are 9-12 weeks and mice are euthanized if they reach the following humane endpoints: >30% loss from peak body weight or poor body composition score (<2). All animal studies were approved and maintained as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)) of Weill Cornell Medicine under protocol number 2013-0116.  Interventional Study Design  Intervention 1  Mice (15 male and 8 female) were induced with Ad5CMV-Cre. Four weeks after induction, mice were stratified by sex and randomized to continue normal chow or start a very low carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet (BioServ S3666) for the duration of the study. Animals were assessed and weighed weekly. Animals were euthanized if they exceeded a weight loss of 30% from their peak weight during the study or if they developed a poor body composition score (<2).",26cd234a-2ceb-43ee-af78-090d1e4344e7
2,methods2," All remaining animals were euthanized at 12 weeks after tumor induction if they did not yet meet euthanasia criteria.  A pilot study was performed on mice (9 male and 8 female) that did not undergo tumor induction to test the safety and efficacy of the ketone ester diet. A subset of the mice (6 male and 5 female) was fed normal chow infused with 10% (v/w) ketone ester (1,3-butanediol-acetoacetate provided by Disruptive Enterprises, LLC). The ketone ester diet was compounded, pelleted, and irradiated by LabDiet (St. Louis, MO). The remaining mice continued the standard normal chow diet. After 3 days of acclimation, blood was sampled from the tail vein every 4 hours for 20 hours to measure beta hydroxybutyrate levels using a point-of-care ketone meter (Precision Xtra). The mice were then euthanized.  Intervention 2  Mice (11 male and 10 female) were induced with Ad5CMV-Cre. Four weeks after tumor induction, mice were randomized to continue normal chow or start the ketone ester diet.",ed13642a-25ca-4308-80d9-59762cbbc675
3,methods3," The remainder of the study was the same as Intervention 1.  Tissue Collection Protocol  Prior to euthanasia, mice were food-deprived for 3 h and then glucose was measured from tail vein blood using a handheld point-of-care glucose meter (OneTouch). Euthanasia was performed using CO2 asphyxiation. Following euthanasia, whole blood was collected via cardiac puncture and placed into serum separator tubes on ice. Subsequently, the whole liver was removed, weighed, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The white adipose tissue, lungs, spleen and skeletal muscles were dissected, weighed, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixated in paraformaldehyde. All tissues were subsequently stored at −80°C until further processing.  Serum Metabolites and Corticosterone  Blood was centrifuged (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C), and serum was stored at −20°C.",6ff91107-1280-4fef-a925-fbc708c099dd
4,methods4," Serum β-hydroxybutyrate, Triglycerides (Stanbio Laboratory), non-esterified fatty acids (Wako Life Sciences), were determined using commercially available kits. Serum corticosterone was quantified by ELISA (ALPCO Diagnostics). The number of samples per cohort that we were able to include in our serum analysis varied on the basis of available blood volume and sensitivity of the kits.  RT-qPCR  Total RNA was extracted from liver tissue (30–50 mg) using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and a tissue homogenizer (Wuhan Servicebio technology) at 70 hz for two rounds of 70 s. After confirming purity, the samples underwent reverse transcription using VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher). Samples were stored at -80°C before the qPCR step was conducted on the next day.",338644d1-c3d0-4d73-8dd7-ffa12ace05c2
5,methods5," Transcripts were amplified using Applied Biosystems TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Thermo Fisher) with the following primers: Acox1 (Mm01246834_m1), Actb (Mm00607939_s1), Bdh1 (Mm00558330_m1), Ehhadh (Mm00619685_m1), Hmgcs2 (Mm00550050_m1), Rer1 (Mm00471276_m1), Rplp0 (Mm00725448_s1), Rpl7l1 (Mm00786031_s1). The mRNA expression levels of the genes of interest were normalized to the arithmetic mean of the four housekeeping-genes and calculated according to the delta-delta ct method (12). All animals included in the analysis were tumor bearing and displayed a weight loss of >10% from peak weight.  Statistics  Statistical analysis was carried out using Prism 9.3.1 (GraphPad Software). Individual data points are provided for every graph and assay with exception of time-course graphs (survival curves, acute ketone ester experiment). The mean ± SEM is displayed in addition to the individual data.",831a35de-b8ef-4e01-8c14-f23acce93953
6,methods6," The statistical test applied was dependent on the analysis performed and is indicated in each legend. Unless otherwise stated, a two-way ANOVA was performed to detect main effects for the dietary intervention, sex differences and any potential interactions between diet and sex. Sidak’s multiple comparison test was run post-hoc to investigate individual differences in the diet response for each sex. The time course of the acute ketone ester experiment was investigated using a repeated measures two-way ANOVA and Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparison test. Survival curves were compared by a Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Samples from male and female mice from the ketone ester cohorts were clustered for RT-qPCR analysis and group differences assessed by an unpaired t-test. A p-value of <0.05 was deemed as statistically significant, values between 0.05 and 0.1 are referred to as trends. ",10b1cd2f-4fe6-4201-889c-2de072e762e0
7,results0," A Ketogenic Diet Increases Ketone Bodies and Decreases Glucose Levels in Cachectic Mice With Lung Cancer  If ketones are essential to preventing the loss of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue mass during cachexia, then reactivating ketogenesis with a dietary intervention should prevent cachexia. This theory was tested using a high-fat, moderate-protein, very low carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet, which is known to initiate ketone body production in the liver (13). The diet was started four weeks after tumor induction to allow for normal tumor development. At this time, mice (15 male and 8 female) were stratified by sex and randomized to continue normal chow (NC) or start a very low carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet (KD) until they met endpoint criteria (30% weight loss, a body composition score <2, or survival at 12 weeks after induction). Beta hydroxybutyrate levels in the serum of male mice on KD were elevated to 1.3 mmol/l compared to 0.3 mmol/l in male mice on a standard chow diet.",7cb287a4-6d94-44ee-95ed-61d5f2fbcb4c
8,results1," Similarly, female mice on a ketogenic diet had mean beta hydroxybutyrate levels of 1.8 mmol/l compared to 0.1 mmol/l in female mice on the control diet. These differences resulted in a significant main effect for the diet intervention (p<0.01), and significant post-hoc differences for both sexes compared to the control groups (p<0.05) ( Figure 1A ). Glucose levels were decreased by 47% in male mice on a ketogenic diet and by 16% in female mice on a ketogenic diet compared to the control groups, resulting in a significant main effect for the dietary intervention (p<0.05) and a post-hoc difference between the male cohorts (p<0.05) ( Figure 1B ). There was a main effect for a sex indicating lower levels of circulating triglycerides in female mice (p<0.01) but no effect of the diet (p=0.52) ( Figure 1C ). The ketogenic diet reduced circulating corticosterone levels by 87 ng/ml in male and by 123 ng/ml in female mice, but this effect failed to reach statistical significance (p=0.",4ace59e5-485f-404b-924f-fa131fe5f3ce

10,results3,"  Increased Ketone Availability and Decreased Glucose Do Not Improve Survival in Cachectic Mice With Lung Cancer  Despite the changes in serum beta hydroxybutyrate and blood glucose, the median survival of male mice on a ketogenic diet was two weeks shorter than mice on a standard diet (KD: 7.6 weeks, NC: 9.6 weeks, p=0.07) ( Figure 2B ). Median survival in female mice on a ketogenic diet was 8.3 weeks compared to 9.1 weeks for mice on the control diet (p=0.8) ( Figure 2D ). Lung mass, a surrogate for tumor burden, was 59% greater in male animals fed a ketogenic diet compared to the normal chow group, but there were no statistically significant main effects for diet (p=0.58), sex (p=0.3), an interaction between diet and sex (p=0.12), or post-hoc for the male mice specifically (p=0.17) ( Figure 2E ).

13,results6,"  Ketone Ester Supplementation Acutely and Chronically Elevates Ketone Body Levels  Ketogenic diets modulate a broad array of metabolic hormones and metabolites in addition to serum ketones. To directly assess the role of the ketone body in cachexia, we fed mice a ketone ester supplement (1,3-butanediol-acetoacetate), which is metabolized to beta hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate by the liver (14). Ketone ester supplements increase the blood ketone levels without global distortions in systemic metabolism (15, 16). To confirm the efficacy and safety of feeding mice a ketone ester supplement, we performed a short pilot study in non-tumor bearing mice to measure the abundance of beta hydroxybutyrate in the circulation over a 24-hour period. In male mice, we found a significant main effect for the diet to elevate beta hydroxybutyrate levels (p<0.001). Post-hoc analysis determined that beta hydroxybutyrate levels were elevated with the ketone ester diet for every single time-point (p<0.",3b19f5d3-82b6-40e9-8263-9f263eadf5d6
14,results7,"05) ( Figure 3A ). Similarly, in female wildtype mice beta hydroxybutyrate levels were significantly increased for the ketone ester diet group (p<0.05) while post-hoc analysis did not reveal significant differences for individual time points ( Figure 3B ). In a 2-week pilot study using non-tumor bearing mice, the ketone ester diet had no deleterious effects on food intake, body weight, or spontaneous activity ( Supplementary Figure ) so we proceeded to perform an intervention study in tumor bearing mice.  Figure 3 Ketone ester supplementation acutely and chronically elevates ketone body levels. Non-tumor bearing mice were fed normal chow (NC) or NC supplemented with a ketone ester (KE). The resulting serum beta hydroxybutyrate levels over the course of 20 hours are shown for male (A) and female (B) mice.

16,results9,"18) ( Figure 3D ). We observed no significant main effects of the diet or the sex of the animals for circulating triglyceride ( Figure 3E ) or corticosterone levels ( Figure 3F ).  Increased Ketone Availability via Dietary Supplementation Does Not Improve Survival in Mice With Lung Cancer  Despite the combination of a balanced diet with increased ketone availability, male mice on a ketone ester supplemented diet lived just as long (a median of 9.7 weeks) as mice on a standard diet (a median of 9.4 weeks) (p=0.62) ( Figure 4B ). Similarly, female mice on a ketone ester supplemented diet lived a median of 8.9 weeks after induction of the virus, while animals on the control diet lived a median of 10.6 weeks (p=0.77) ( Figure 4D ). There was no main effect for the diet (p=0.58), sex (p=0.3), or the interaction between diet and sex (p=0.12) for lung weight ( Figure 4E ).

There was no effect of the diet (p=0.84) or an interaction between diet and sex (p=0.86) for white adipose tissue. While there was no main effect of the diet (p=0.72) on gastrocnemius mass, there was a main effect for sex differences (p<0.05) and a trend toward an interaction effect between the sex and the diet (p=0.06), with mass tending to increase in male- and decrease in female mice ( Figure 4G ). There was a significant sex difference for spleen mass (p<0.05) but no effect of the diet (p=0.79) and no interaction effect (p=0.13) ( Figure 4H ).

Ketone Ester Supplementation Activates Hepatic peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α  We examined peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α activity in the liver of mice fed normal chow and the ketone ester diet.",20f04b5b-3b48-4ed0-9539-854457f61fc2
19,results12," We found that the ketone ester supplementation increased the mRNA expression of hepatic peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α targets. Acox1 mRNA expression increased by 66% in the liver of mice on the ketone ester diet compared to the control diet (p<0.05) ( Figure 5A ). Similarly, Bdh1 expression increased by 70% in mice fed a ketone ester diet (p<0.05) ( Figure 5B ). In line with these observations, we observed trends for increased Ehhadh and Hmgcs2 expression. Ehhadh increased to 2.5-fold (p=0.05) ( Figure 5C ) and Hmgcs2 by 85% (p=0.07) ( Figure 5D ) in mice on a ketone ester diet compared to a standard chow diet.

21,discussion0," In this study, we used two dietary interventions to test the hypothesis that circulating ketones protect peripheral tissue mass during cachexia. Both the ketogenic diet and ketone ester supplement significantly increased blood ketones in mice with lung cancer, however this increase did not prevent or delay the onset of cachexia. Furthermore, there was no preservation of skeletal muscle or adipose tissue mass, and overall survival did not change. These data clearly negate our hypothesis.  The ketogenic diet has been suggested as a treatment for a wide range of medical conditions, including migraines (17), epilepsy (18), multiple sclerosis (19), Alzheimer’s disease (20), diabetes (21), aging (22), cancer (23), and cancer associated cachexia (24). One of the primary mechanisms underlying the purported benefits of the ketogenic diet is the switch from glucose as a primary fuel to fatty acids and ketone bodies.",36b8a012-d129-46ca-a5ab-cc169915f53b
22,discussion1," In support of this concept, we previously reported decreased levels of beta hydroxybutyrate in mice with lung cancer induced cachexia, and significant anti-cachectic benefits when ketogenesis was restored with the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α agonist, fenofibrate (5).  In this study, we anticipated that the ketogenic diet would activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α, restore ketogenesis, and protect against cachexia; however, this was not the case. While animals on a ketogenic diet have substantially higher circulating levels of ketones, this response did not preserve skeletal muscle mass or body weight. Furthermore, we observed several worrisome trends when mice with lung cancer were fed a ketogenic diet. Male mice tended to have increased tumor burden, decreased skeletal muscle and adipose tissue mass, and worse survival.",d4f820a4-9ae0-4f3f-89f9-c19918d1b067
23,discussion2," These effects were not observed in the mice fed the ketone ester supplement, which suggests that the ketone body itself is not directly involved in these responses. There are numerous differences between the ketogenic diet and normal chow that could be contributing to these effects, including the low carbohydrate and fiber content, the moderate protein restriction, and large amount of dietary lipids. Bhatt et al. previously described how loss of Lkb1 makes lung tumors dependent on fatty acid oxidation, so we speculate that the excess dietary lipids are a major contributor to the worsened survival (25).  In an attempt to avoid large changes in dietary macronutrient content, we created a well-balanced dietary formulation that contains exogenous ketones in the form of a ketone ester. This diet increased the availability of ketones in the circulation of mice with and without lung cancer.",80f844ea-9308-4460-bebf-8acdfa52fc3a
24,discussion3," Nevertheless, the ester had no effect on survival, body weight, nor skeletal muscle and adipose tissue mass when it was fed to tumor-bearing mice. These data suggest that “ketone replacement therapy” using a ketone ester supplement or ketogenic diet is not a useful strategy to prevent cachexia in mice with lung cancer.  Previously, we found that mice with lung cancer induced cachexia have decreased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α activity in the liver (5). Restoring hepatic peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α with fenofibrate was associated with an improved disease course and preserved muscle and adipose tissue mass. To investigate whether peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α activity plays a pathophysiologic role in cancer cachexia in this model, we examined peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α activity in the liver of mice fed normal chow and the ketone ester diet.",7f8f8557-84fa-4779-8e9f-6d8596206d6c
25,discussion4," Interestingly, we found that the ester-fed mice had increased expression levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α gene targets in the liver. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show this effect and it remains unclear how the ester amplifies peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α activity. The ester may increase the total abundance of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α by stimulating short-chain fatty acid receptors such as GPR41/FFA3 (26), GPR43/FFA2 (27) or other G protein-coupled receptors like GPR109A/HCA2 (28), as has been shown in neuronal tissue (29). Beta hydroxybutyrate can also activate AMPK in the livers of rats and AMPK is known to be an upstream regulator of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α in various tissues (30–35). Nevertheless, the activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α was not associated with improved tissue preservation or survival in our model.",5d58da85-46ac-417b-9312-26a38ad8dd49
26,discussion5," These data suggest that the restoration of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α in the liver was not driving the beneficial effects of fenofibrate in our prior study (5).  Our results are in contrast to other reports that describe improvements in weight and survival in mouse models of cancer fed ketogenic diets (36–38) and ketone ester supplements (39). These disparate effects may be due to the inherent differences in tumor location and molecular drivers of tumor growth in each pre-clinical model. In this study, we used a genetic model of lung cancer driven by an activating mutation in Kras and loss of the tumor suppressor gene, Lkb1 (Stk11). This combination of genetic alterations enhances tumor fatty acid oxidation and, in some instances, upregulates ketolytic enzymes (25, 40, 41). In this setting, the ketogenic diet may enhance tumor progression by stimulating tumor growth and create deleterious changes to the tumor microenvironment (42).",74d63f06-6872-44da-84dd-3a260c6ea9a0
27,discussion6," An additional reason for the discrepancies to other studies could be the composition of our diet and dosage of the ketone esters, as other studies with successful outcomes have used a higher dietary content of ketones in the diet (39).  One limitation of our study is the small sample size of the female mice in the ketogenic diet cohort, which limits our ability to detect sex-specific effects. The data were separated by sex to highlight the known differences in muscle mass and distinct changes in white adipose tissue that occur in response to diet. To that end, we observed that female mice with lung cancer maintained more white adipose tissue on a ketogenic diet than male mice; however, this change had no positive effect on survival nor body weight. These observations add to the recent and important appreciation for sex differences in the field of cancer cachexia (43–47).",17fa62bb-a3e6-4a57-8462-50c43c2ecc96
28,discussion7," Another limitation is the lack of a functional analysis of the skeletal muscle tissue, which would have allowed us to investigate whether there had been changes in performance that were independent from changes in muscle mass.  In summary, increasing ketone body availability and hepatic peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α activity through a ketogenic diet or ketone ester supplementation in mice with lung cancer did not increase survival, nor did it improve the maintenance of body weight and muscle mass. Future research needs to delineate the primary mechanism through which tissue wasting is driven in this model to improve the design of adequate therapeutical interventions.
