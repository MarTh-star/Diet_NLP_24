6,results0," The ketogenic diet improved glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in db/db mice To test whether the KD benefited the management of diabetes mellitus, mice were subjected to a normal diet (Control) or ketogenic diet (KD) for 8 weeks, starting at the age of 8 weeks. Compared with age-matched control mice, db/db mice showed an increased body weight and KD treatment further increased the bodyweight (Figure1 A). These results on body weight were different from those reported in a previous study [29], possibly because of using different diabetic models. Although the body weight increased, feeding the KD did not increased serum NEFA and total cholesterol levels but decreased serum triglyceride levels in db/db mice (Table 1). Interestingly, feeding the KD decreased the levels of fasting blood glucose (Fig. 1B) and serum insulin (Fig. 1C) in db/db mice. Moreover, feeding the KD improved insulin sensitivity as assessed by insulin stimulation tests (Fig. 1D).",77c2bfd7-ee02-4679-a215-e380ace15738

8,results2," Compared with the control group, db/db mice exhibited impaired cardiac function as evidenced by a decreased left ventricular rejection fraction (left ventricular rejection fraction (LVEF)) and an increased left ventricular internal dimension (left ventricular internal dimension (LVID)) (Fig. 2A). In addition, db/db mice had an increased heart weight and heart weight-to-tibia length ratio (Fig. 2B). Feeding the KD increased left ventricular rejection fraction (LVEF) and normalized left ventricular internal dimension (LVID) in db/db mice (Fig. 2A) and also aignificantly decreased the heart weight and weight-to-tibia length ratio (Fig. 2B). Fibrosis is a major feature of diabetic cardiomyopathy, and our data demonstrated that feeding the KD reduced the level of cardiac fibrosis in db/db mice (Fig. 2C). These findings indicated that the KD exerted cardioprotective effects in db/db mice.",60e293b3-cf46-47d9-a312-24fd16b0765a
9,results3,"  The ketogenic diet prevented mitochondrial fission and improved mitochondrial function in the myocardium of db/db mice It has been suggested that mitochondrial dynamics plays a pivotal role in cardiac function [30]. We next determined whether the KD regulated mitochondrial morphology and function in the heart of db/db mice. As expected, diabetes resulted in cardiac mitochondrial fragmentation as evidenced by increased mitochondrial number and decreased mitochondrial size in db/db mice (Fig. 3A). The mitochondrial respiratory control ratio (Fig. 3B) and ATP content (Fig. 3C) were also significantly decreased in db/db mice. Notably, feeding the KD prevented mitochondrial fission and improved mitochondrial function in db/db mice (Fig. 3A-C). These findings suggested that feeding the KD rebalanced mitochondrial dynamics and function in db/db mice.   Figure 2.

To investigate the underlying mechanism of these effects of the KD on mitochondrial dynamics by KD, we measured the levels of the main mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins (Fig. 3D). There was no difference in the content of Mfn1 and Mfn2. It has been proven that L-Opa1 contributes to mitochondrial fusion and that S-Opa1 is required for mitochondrial fission. The ratio of L-Opa1/S-Opa1 was decreased in the heart of db/db mice, and the KD significantly increased this ratio. Both Drp1 and Fis1 promote mitochondrial fission, and the contents of Drp1 and Fis1 increased in db/db mice. Feeding the KD decreased the content of Fis1 in db/db mice but did not affect the levels of Drp1.",9cdb051e-bd38-41f0-bf62-698b74f3eee8
12,results6," These results indicated that feeding the KD inhibited mitochondrial fission and improved mitochondrial function via regulating the expression levels of mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins.  The ketogenic diet suppressed oxidative stress in the heart of db/db mice ROS are generated during the process of mitochondrial respiration when electrons are leaked to O2 at some sites in the electron transport chain [31]. Unbalanced mitochondrial dynamics is one factor that leads to ROS overproduction. Thus, we examined the levels of ROS. Indeed, the myocardium of db/db mice showed a marked increase in ROS generation as evidenced by DHE staining (Fig. 4A). malondialdehyde (MDA) is a major product of lipid peroxidation and MnSOD is a main antioxidant enzyme that protects against oxidative damage. Both malondialdehyde (MDA) and MnSOD can serve as indicators of oxidative stress.",77c9e10a-f351-447e-b94c-9e5fc88ade52
13,results7," Indeed, a decreased MnSOD level and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) production were found in the heart of db/db mice (Fig. 4B and C). In contrast, feeding the KD decreased ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) generation but partly increased MnSOD activity partly. These results indicated that the KD suppressed oxidative stress in the heart of db/db mice.   Figure 3.

The ketogenic diet attenuated cardiocyte apoptosis in db/db mice Mitochondrial dynamics plays a central role in the maintenance of the cell proliferation-apoptosis balance [32]. We next determined the effects of the KD on cardiomyocyte apoptosis under diabetic conditions. We found that compared to control mice, db/db mice had a significantly increased apoptosis level (Fig. 5A) and caspase-3 activity (Fig. 5B). Additionally, the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax was decreased in myocardium samples from diabetic hearts (Fig. 5C).

To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the anti- apoptotic effects of the KD, we measured the contents of PI3K, p-Akt and Akt in myocardium samples. The content of PI3K and the ratio of p-Akt/Akt were markedly decreased in db/db mice, and these changes were restored partly by KD treatment (Fig. 6A).",790d319c-8cb7-43c9-826c-9c4f511b49d9
16,results10," Many studies have demonstrated that KD treatment enhances the levels of the ketone body metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (body metabolite beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB)) [34], and our data showed the KD increased the myocardium body metabolite beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) level (Table 1) ; Thus, we next performed studies to determine whether this ketone body had direct anti- apoptotic effects in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose (30 mM) for 10-12 hours.. It was found that high glucose resulted in a significant decrease in the ratio of p-Akt/Akt, accompanied by a decrease in the ratio of Bcl2/Bax and an increase in caspase-3 activity (Fig. 6B and C), while treatment with the ketone body body metabolite beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) (10 mM) treatment not only increased the ratio of p-Akt/Akt and Bcl2/Bax but also decreased the activity of caspases-3 in isolated cardiomyocytes.",cc4af209-be0d-4ff1-a9a8-cba696876509
17,results11," More importantly, body metabolite beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) improved cell viability in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose for 24 hours (Fig. 6D). All these protective effects were blunted and even reversed by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (100 nM) (Fig. 6A-D), suggesting that body metabolite beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exerted protective effects via the PI3K-Akt pathway. Those results indicated that the KD protects the hearts from diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) partly through the PI3K-Akt pathway.   Figure 4.

19,discussion0," Endocrine and metabolic disruptions play a significant role in the initiation and progression of DM. It has been proposed that dietary intervention should be a primary strategy in the clinical management of DM [35]. In this study, we found that KD treatment ameliorated cardiac dysfunction and remodeling in db/db mice. The ketone body body metabolite beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) was found to have an anti-apoptotic effect on the diabetic myocardium via the PI3K/Akt pathway. These findings, together with those indicating that feeding mice the KD preserved mitochondrial function and decreased oxidative stress, suggesting the potential for the use of ketone bodies in anti-diabetic therapy.

Various studies have demonstrated that the KD shifts the metabolism substrate from carbohydrates to fatty acids in individuals with diabetes and benefits the management of DM clinically [36]. Some studies on animals have also shown that the KD can prevents the development of diabetes [37, 38].In addition, a recent animal study showed that the KD extends longevity and health span in adult mice [13]. Another study found that the KD reduces midlife mortality and improves memory in aging mice [19].",abc7ff41-0d10-4b17-9cf7-82d8f4177392
21,discussion2," Our previous work demonstrated that feeding a high-fat diet (45% of calories derived from fatty acids) feeding for 2 months after transverse aortic constriction (transverse aortic constriction (TAC)) surgery enhanced fatty acid utilization and prevented the development of heart failure in mice [20]. These findings suggested that the KD, a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet, may exert health-promoting effects in both humans and animals.  In this study, we observed that feeding mice the KD decreased blood glucose and improved insulin sensitivity. However, we observed that feeding the KD did not reduce but increased body weight in diabetic mice, which is different from the reported in a previous study [29]. The difference in the diabetic models used may this difference, as another study performed on ob/ob mice also showed that feeding the KD increased bodyweight as well [39]. Regardless, our data suggested that feeding the KD ameliorates cardiac dysfunction and remodeling in db/db mice.",25d7f907-4356-498b-97f5-4c45ca9ea986

23,discussion4,"    It has been demonstrated that mitochondria play an important role in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) [40]. Mitochondrial dynamics, which are regulated by several specific mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins, determine mitochondrial morphology and function [41]. It has been reported that there are links between mitochondrial dynamics and feeding the KD [42]. In this diabetic model, the significant cardiac dysfunction and myocardial remodeling were accompanied by mitochondrial fission and dysfunction. In accordance with this, our results indicated that mitochondrial became fragmented and that their function was impaired, as evidenced by decreased ATP content and respiration control rate. Feeding the KD inhibited mitochondrial fission and improved mitochondrial function, which may be an underlying mechanism contributing to the protection of cardiac function.",be75e7de-2225-416e-a2c1-3d55abb47cb5
24,discussion5," Mfn1/2 and Opa1(mediate mitochondrial fusion), as well as Drp1 and Fis1 (mediate mitochondrial fission) are abundant in cardiac tissue [43]. We found that feeding the KD significantly increased the ratio of L-Opa1/S-OPa1 and decreased the levels of Fis1, indicating that these two proteins may be promising targets for further studies on the prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM).  In addition to supplying energy, mitochondria have been recognized as a main source of ROS in the myocardium. Mitochondrial dysfunction results in excessive ROS generation [44]. In this study, we found increased ROS generation in the myocardium accompanied by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) production and decreased MnSOD activity in diabetic mice. Feeding the KD suppressed the ROS production and increased MnSOD activity and reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the heart of db/db mice, suggesting that the KD exerted an anti-oxidative stress effects in diabetic mice.",33edc1c4-29d4-403c-91f6-6b7662463085
25,discussion6," However, whether this is a direct effect or a benefit from improved mitochondrial function requires further study.  Mitochondrial dynamics are involved in many cellular processes, including apoptosis, which plays a crucial role in the process of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) [45, 46]. Mitochondrial fragmentation is related to many forms of cell death, but mitochondrial fusion protects cell from apoptosis. The PI3K/Akt pathway plays important roles in preventing apoptosis, and inhibition of this pathway contributes to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) [47]. In the present study, the content of PI3K and the ratio of p-Akt/Akt were significantly lower but apoptosis was active in myocardium samples from db/db mice compared with those in samples from control mice.",2aebb737-a5d8-461b-8f79-a4192ea0d01d
26,discussion7," KD treatment not only markedly reversed the changes in the content of PI3K and the ratio of p-Akt/Akt but also suppressed myocardial apoptosis as evidenced by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl nick end labeling (TUNEL) results. Additionally, in isolated cardiomyocytes, we confirmed that the ketone body body metabolite beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, thus increasing the ration of Bcl2/Bax and decreasing the activity of caspase-3. Wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, eliminated the anti-apoptotic effects of body metabolite beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in cardiomyocytes, suggesting that the KD exerted anti-apoptotic effects via activating the PI3K-Akt pathway in diabetic mice.  However, our study had several limitations. We investigated the effects of the KD in db/db mice, but the efficacy of the KD in other diabetic models still needs to be elucidated in future studies.",9e38573d-926a-4abe-af94-7a5c9f458ae5
27,discussion8," In addition, we clarified the anti-apoptosis mechanism in vitro using an inhibitor of PI3K, but studies performed with Akt conditional knockout mice would generate more direct evidences. Furthermore, the specific mechanism by which the KD regulates glucose homeostasis should be further explored.  Conclusions Taken together, the KD not only balanced glucose homeostasis but also alleviated cardiac dysfunction by inhibiting apoptosis via the activating PI3K-Akt pathway in type 2 diabetic mice. Therefore, the KD may be a promising lifestyle intervention for the management of diabetes mellitus to retard the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy.
