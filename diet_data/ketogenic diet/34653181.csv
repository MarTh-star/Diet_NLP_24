Patients  Eighty patients (forty women and forty men) affected by overweight/obesity and T2DM or prediabetes age (years): 51.95 ± 1.75; BMI (kg/m2): 33.08 ± 1.83; HA1c (%): 6.5% ± 0.25) were enrolled at the University Service of Diet Therapy, Diabetology and Metabolic Diseases, Policlinico Riuniti Hospital of Foggia, Puglia, Italy.  The 80 patients were divided into two groups of 40 and distributed as follows. In the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED group 20 patients was overweight and had a form of prediabetes, of which 5 women with impaired glucose tolerance and 5 women with impaired fasting glucose and 5 men with impaired fasting glucose and 5 men with impaired glucose tolerance while 20 patients was obese, 10 women and 10 men, and had type 2 diabetes. The VLCD_MED group had the same composition. Overweight patients with prediabetes and obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were equally distributed between the two groups.",aee7634d-c11b-430e-bc2e-c500edb37f5f

As the adopted study design is a small-scale pilot trial, no sample size was calculated. Retrospectively, a sample size based on the mean difference in HbA1c (%) and calculated SD observed in previous studies [27] identified a number of 15 participants per group as the sample size needed to detect a hypothetical treatment effect for a before-and-after study with a significance level of 5% and a study power of 80%.

Personal dietary intake was measured by weighted dietary diaries, compiled by patients and sent every five days by email to registered dieticians. In addition, every ten days, group meetings were held between the registered dieticians and patients to gather general feedback, assess diet adherence and provide help.  2.4.1. Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Mediterranean Diet Characteristics  The very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet was formulated according to the ketogenic diet criteria but adopting as many foods as possible from the Mediterranean diet. The aim was to obtain the condition of “Mediterranean” ketosis, induce weight loss, and improve gluco-metabolic parameters while preserving lean mass through an adequate amount of protein without configuring the diet as a high-protein diet.",e4a7e3ea-c531-4aa6-9f36-687c520d096c
9,methods9,"  For the very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet, a protein intake of 1.2–1.4 g/kg/ideal body weight for men was used, while for women, the protein intake was 1.1–1.2 g/kg/ideal body weight.  The ideal body weight was calculated with the inverse formula of BMI (kg/m2) using a target value of BMI (kg/m2) of 22, so the proteins represented on average 32 percent of daily calories, with differences between the patients according to individual needs and body composition. The daily calorie intake was around 800 kcal/day, configuring a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet.  The maximum daily carbohydrate intake was set to less than 50 g to reduce blood glucose and insulin and obtain the hepatic production of ketones through the consequent rapid activation of lipolysis. Carbohydrate intake averaged 20 g per day, based on the number of vegetables consumed, and represented 10 percent of daily calories.",68a4fcd3-7883-482c-ad78-4185ddba4794

The extra virgin olive oil amounted to 20 g consumed during the day, adding to the lipid contents of white meat and fish.  The breakfast consists of oleaginous fruit such as nuts, almonds, cashews, pistachios, and peanuts. Unsweetened soft drinks such as herbal teas, tea, and coffee were used as they do not interfere with the condition of ketosis and increase compliance with the diet of the enrolled patients.  A two-course meal was provided for lunch: one based on white meat or fish and a second course based on cooked or raw green vegetables. The patients could choose from two lists of vegetables.",4e7cf0da-33f6-48f3-9ee2-1b5d9200251a

The second list includes the vegetables that patients could eat in free quantities, given that their limited carbohydrate contents do not exceed the maximum daily carbohydrate limits.  With regard to white meat or fish, the patient could choose from a list of foods that varied daily, provided that fish was consumed at least four times a week. The portions of white meat or fish were assigned according to the individual protein and body composition requirements.

Dinner follows the same pattern as lunch: a portion of white meat or fish and a portion of cooked or raw green vegetables with extra virgin olive oil. Wine is not allowed for dinner. Table 2 shows the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED food list.  The need for minerals, vitamins, and fibers is filled from the various vegetables and relative amount choices. In fact, patients of both dietary groups were encouraged to eat vegetables, especially those included in the free quantities list, and to exceed the recommended daily serving size, varying the choice and combination of the vegetables as much as possible [30].",168a18db-b4a3-431f-a649-b461bf238d11

The daily carbohydrate intake exceeded 50 g, so the hepatic production of ketones did not occur.  Unlike the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED diet, the VLCD_MED has no limitations in the choice of foods, where the total daily energy intake represents the only limitation.

Discussion  The main findings of the present study may be summarized in terms of a decrease in weight (kg) and BMI (kg/m2) and in a positive remodulation of metabolic parameters other than an improvement in body composition parameters. The results suggest that the very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet, or Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED, caused a significant and more extensive decrease compared to the very-low-calorie Mediterranean, or VLCD_MED, diet, in body weight, and also produced an improvement in body composition parameters and several metabolic markers linked to prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and risk of cardiovascular disease.  Other authors have successfully studied the Mediterranean ketogenic diet. In 2008, Guisado et al.",bc13b5f4-a807-4573-b478-93f1ac5232b3
28,methods31," [36] proposed the first Spanish ketogenic Mediterranean diet as an efficient method for reducing body fat, improving non-atherogenic lipid profiles, lowering blood pressure and optimizing fasting glucose levels, and as an effective and safe way to treat patients suffering from metabolic syndrome and associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. More recently, in 2011, Paoli et al. [37] proposed a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet, defined as the KEMEPHY diet, achieving good results in reducing body weight and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight and obese patients.  However, both Mediterranean ketogenic diets have different characteristics. The Spanish ketogenic Mediterranean diet is an unlimited-calorie diet. The KEMEPHY Mediterranean ketogenic with phytoextracts diet protocol had a daily calorie content between 1000 and 1200 Kcal and provided the use of phytocompounds, with beta-adrenergic action stimulating lipolysis.",5d332c96-6130-4d1b-a621-70bf770f07b8
29,methods32," So, both approaches, though developed as Mediterranean ketogenic diets, are not very-low-calorie ketogenic diet and, in the case of Paoli, include the use of herbal extracts that can enhance lipolysis regardless of nutritional intervention.  Conversely, the proposed dietary regimen is an exclusively nutritional intervention and is a very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet [38,39]  Moreover, according to the previously published research, the reduction in appetite resulted from ketone production, and the higher effect on satiety is due to the use of proteins, which are linked to appetite control hormones such as ghrelin, amylin, and leptin [40,41,42]. For this purpose, capillary ß-hydroxybutyrate concentration was measured as a direct and reliable index of the occurrence of ketosis. If an increase in the blood concentration of ketones had not been detected, the purpose of the diet to induce the ketosis process would not have been achieved.",a01d10ae-03da-40e6-92cc-271a8a09b3f0
30,methods33,"  The absence of significant variations in the blood concentrations of the hepatic function indices, GOT (U/L), GPT (U/L), GGT (U/L), and serum creatinine allowed us to exclude any adverse changes in hepatic and renal function due to both dietary interventions.  Furthermore, satisfying results were obtained with Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED compared to the VLCD_MED diet in improving the anthropometric and body compositions bioimpedance parameters, significantly and more intensely reducing body weight (kg), waist circumference (cm), hip circumference (cm), BMI (kg/m2), WHR (ratio) FM (kg), basal metabolism (kcal), and total body water (kg), with no significant differences in free fat mass expressed in kilograms (FFM) (kg). However, the reduction in the basal metabolism and the total body water pre- and post-diet for both diets, considered as numerical absolute magnitude values, are clinically insignificant.",7a9e1348-b990-4632-93e9-6f6baa5a719a
31,methods34,"  Additionally, Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED, compared to the VLCD_MED diet, showed a substantial improvement with a significantly stronger reduction in the levels of fasting blood glucose (mg/dL), insulin (µU/mL), glycosylated hemoglobin (%), HOMA index, C peptide (ng/mL), total cholesterol (mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (mg/dL), triglyceridemia (mg/dL), and aspartate aminotransferase (U/L), with no difference between the diets for HDL cholesterol (mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase (U/L), gamma-glutamyl transferase (U/L), and serum creatinine (mg/dL). Interestingly, there is a significant reduction in C-peptide (ng/mL). This result suggests, together with the reduction in HOMA index, an improvement in insulin resistance that is strictly connected to a well-balanced gluco-metabolic condition.",ba36fe55-ab0e-45d9-aa15-580556345e3a
32,methods35,"  The proposed nutritional treatment has also been effective in influencing blood lipoprotein values, with a significant decrease in total cholesterol (mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (mg/dL), and triglycerides (mg/dL), without a substantial reduction in the value of HDL (mg/dL). These results positively impact lipid profile control, slowing down or even stopping prediabetes and diabetes complications such as cardiovascular [43] or microvascular diseases [44].  Otherwise, the very-low-calorie Mediterranean diet shows a substantially smaller decrease in all anthropometric, body composition and gluco-metabolic parameters and therefore has not led to an unbalanced gluco-metabolic and lipidic control.  Despite the very low caloric intake, both diets have no free fat mass expressed in kilograms (FFM) (kg) reduction.",3c55e3a2-a55e-4020-8198-21a7efbb615c
33,methods36," This is probably correlated with protein intake, which exerted a protein sparing effect on muscle mass and inhibited muscle catabolism, as already documented by other publications [45,46].  This pilot study was conducted in preparation for a larger successful future RCT to explore the efficiency and internal validity of the proposed trial.  Moreover, this study is an absolute novelty for the type of nutritional intervention adopted, a method of intervention that is currently very poorly investigated in the scientific medical literature, namely the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED.",7ae7cc0c-ac57-450b-bf49-1e2c12964e7e
34,methods37,"  The duration of only thirty days of the nutritional intervention has been determined in consideration of the following elements:- The production kinetics of blood beta butyrate hydroxy reaches almost the maximum concentration value on the twentieth day, as demonstrated by Cahill and Veech [47];  - The lipolysis rate begins on the tenth day and reaches a plateau on the twentieth [48];  - The short duration ensures maximum patient compliance and avoids patients dropping out during the very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet.  Even if the diet period was only very short, combining the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet with the Mediterranean diet means selecting the best elements of the two diets. The fusion of the two types of diet leads to effects on fasting blood glucose, lipid profiles, and rapid weight and fat loss, with the preservation of lean mass and with total compliance of patients.",af931cdc-455a-4614-9f73-3657a353891b
35,methods38," The patients benefit at the same time from the protective nutritional, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties deriving from Mediterranean foods such as vegetables, oleaginous fruit, extra virgin olive oil, and wine [49], and as confirmed by the total ORAC and PRAL values, along with the scores of the Mediterranean diet serving and Mediterranean adequacy index.  5. Conclusions  We have demonstrated that the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)_MED, compared with the VLCD_MED diet, exerts a stronger positive effect not only on anthropometric and body composition parameters, but also and most especially on gluco-metabolic and lipidic control, even if over a short time of only thirty days, in overweight/obese patients with prediabetes or non-insulin-dependent T2D, without any worsening of hepatic or kidney function.",ae472b7f-9243-4ef1-a417-e7c87b41430b
36,methods39,"  The novelty of our approach is to have combined the many health advantages of the Mediterranean diet, with the positive effects of the state of “nutritional ketosis” to improves gluco-metabolic and lipid control, reduce body weight and change the body composition and consequently reduce cardio-vascular risk factors, of in overweight/obese people with prediabetes or T2D.  Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first exclusively nutritional intervention conducted in Italy based on the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet combined with the Mediterranean diet, without phytoextracts or drugs, over a very short time period, to testify to and confirm the effectiveness of the method discussed in this work, but further studies are needed to clarify the potential use of this diet approach in preventing and/or treating prediabetes or diabetes and overweight/obesity.
