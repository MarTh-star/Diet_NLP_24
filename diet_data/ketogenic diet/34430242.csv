0,discussion0," Previous case reports have shown that the KD can be effective in managing primary brain cancer in children and adults [8-12]. However, to our knowledge, no prior case studies have described a therapeutic effect of a KD against metastatic or secondary brain cancer. We attempted to address the cause of the favorable disease course in our patient. The favorable response to therapy in this patient could have been an effect of conventional therapy, the KD therapy, or a combination of these effects.  non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly aggressive pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor, and affected patients generally have a significantly worse prognosis than patients with large-cell carcinomas, even in stage 1 disease [14,15]. Moreover, little has been established regarding a standard treatment strategy for this type of advanced clinical cancer. Growth management is not generally observed after chemo and radiation therapy [16,17].",4b8c4e76-ef2a-4619-88b6-7b4588e7880d
1,discussion1," Remarkably, the patient’s tumor growth, including brain metastasis, was stabilized and even diminished about one year after completion of the standard treatment and long after. The only therapeutic intervention during this period was the KD. Therefore, it is possible that the diet was partly responsible for the patient’s improvement.  The above beneficial effect of the KD is also supported by the fact that no effect on the disease course was observed throughout the latest period when the patient was receiving conventional therapy. It is important to mention that the low-normal glucose levels could have also contributed in part to the restricted tumor growth in our patient. Previous studies in mice and humans with brain cancer have shown that low blood glucose levels are associated with reduced brain tumor growth rate and better survival, while elevated glucose or hyperglycemia contributes to rapid tumor growth and poor patient survival [9,18].",93d45142-c12d-46f1-953d-70105a8b0ea6
2,discussion2," Elevated blood glucose is also a risk factor for breast cancer and non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [19]. It is likely that the combination of both reduced glucose levels and elevated ketone levels contributed to tumor management, as described previously [8,19].  Another interesting point is the lipidemic profile of the patient. The patient developed dyslipidemia only after 10 years on the 3:1 KD without evidence of tumor recurrence. At first glance, this observation could be correlated to the fact that the tumor was no longer active. However, further studies will be needed to determine the origin of dyslipidemia following long-term treatment of cancer patients with Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT).  Conclusions  This case report gives hope that the KD might improve clinical outcomes for some patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).",1040d9b9-9460-40e0-a3b9-179d6753acb0
3,discussion3," The tumor shrinkage, survival time, spectacular improvement in physical condition, and the restoration of daily attitudes are encouraging for further application of this therapeutic approach to larger numbers of patients.
