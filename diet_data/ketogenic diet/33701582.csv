Patients were recruited from the children’s unit of Kaufbeuren Hospital.  2.1. Observational Period  For patient 1 and 2, the observational period began at the initiation of the KD and lasted for six months. Patient 3 received pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) for one month and was subsequently switched to a three-month period of the KD.  2.2. Glucose and Ketone Measurement  Glucose and ketone concentrations were controlled using a flash glucose monitoring system (FreeStyle libre®). Glucose was determined by using the implanted glucose sensor, FreeStyle libre®. For additional calibration, glucose was determined several times per day by capillary blood glucose measurement. Parents reported the capillary blood glucose measurement in a diary with additional notes about clinically related symptoms such as nausea or fatigue.",c70ccad3-cda4-4e97-aa40-630ac85022cd
1,methods1," Hypoglycemia was defined according to the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISDAP)) Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines 2014, as a serum glucose level of 65 mg/dL or lower [27]. Hyperglycemia was defined as a serum glucose level of 140 mg/dL or higher [28]. The therapeutic range of the ketone concentrations was set between 2 and 6 mmol/L.  2.3. Qualitative Measurement  At the end of the observational period, a questionnaire was filled out by the parents. For patients 1 and 2, the questionnaire was filled out six months after initiating the KD. For patient 3, the questionnaire was filled out three months after the initiation of the KD.",cb571db7-1704-4748-bcdf-e52804f24f01
2,methods2," The questionnaire was developed in-house and consisted of one item concerning the number and semiology of seizures during the therapy, and 10 Likert-scaled items about the development of cognition (concentration, language, memory), motor skills, social behavior, emotional state, and sleep quality (for example: “How do you rate the sleep quality of your child?” ranging from 1 = extremely bad to 10 = extremely good), each measured before, during, and after the treatment.  2.4. Patients—Three Cases  2.4.1. Patient 1  The girl was born by caesarean section. At the age of 5.4 years, generalized seizures occurred. In the electroencephalogram (EEG), interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) over both hemispheres were registered. During the following years, an increasing number of seizures occurred including one grand mal seizure with status epilepticus. Family history was negative, cognitive performance and attention was declining, as reported by the mother.",3d5de927-bf84-4365-bd23-c7bcb9f08109
3,methods3," MRI of the brain showed no abnormalities. Clinical, biochemical, metabolic, and cardiologic (electrocardiogram (ECG), 24 h ECG, blood pressure measurement and echocardiography), as well as genetic evaluation, revealed no abnormal findings.  After initial treatment with levetiracetam, she was switched to valproate due to aggressive behavior and an increasing frequency of atonic seizures. Consecutively, rufinamide and clobazam were added in combination.  KD—Observational period:  At age 6.0 years, the girl was diagnosed with electrical status epilepticus during slow wave sleep (ESES). A 2.5:1 KD consisting of 2.5 times the amount of fat as carbohydrates was initiated, alongside a treatment with valproate and clobazam. For example, this equates to 2.5 g of fat per 1 g of carbohydrates. Eleven weeks after the beginning of the KD, lamotrigine administration was started and clobazam was withdrawn.  2.4.2.

Clinical, ophthalmologic, biochemical, metabolic, and genetic evaluation revealed no abnormal findings. First, he was treated with levetiracetam, clobazam, and zonisamid. Due to continuing seizures, a cortisone therapy was initiated at age 4.8 years, with no significant decrease in interictal activity. During the clinical evaluation of the cortisone therapy, cardiologic evaluation revealed a pulmonary valve insufficiency and a tricuspid insufficiency.  Although the boy was treated consecutively with topiramate, potassium bromid, and perampanel, myoclonic seizures increased in frequency and severity. The patient showed up to 100 myoclonia per day with severe falls. Additionally, ADHD was diagnosed, and amphetamine was administered.  KD—Observational period:  At age 6.8 years, the KD was started in conjunction with a parallel treatment with perampanel, clobazame, and zonisamid.",fdd44d8d-56b0-4c3f-a15e-3bf2603c98fa
5,methods5," After three months, the 3:1 KD consisting of three times the amount of fat as carbohydrates was switched to a 2.5:1 KD, due to weight gain and dry skin.  2.4.3. Patient 3  The girl was born by vaginal delivery. Postnatally, microcephaly was registered, and the development of language and fine motor skills were delayed. At the age of 7.4 years, ADHD was diagnosed and, therefore, the girl was treated with methylphenidate, which was later switched to guanfacine and then later to risperidone. In the EEG, focal and generalized IEDs, as well as generalized slowing were found, and the girl was diagnosed with electrical status epilepticus during slow wave sleep (ESES). MRI of the brain showed no abnormalities. Biochemical and metabolism evaluation revealed no abnormal findings. Genetic analyses showed a mutation of FBXO11, which can be associated with intellectual disability and behavioral anomalies [29].",0ad752d1-fd8c-4f4e-8411-ebfc51603bad
6,methods6,"  Previously, the girl was treated with levetiracetam, valproate, sultiam, and lamotrigine, which led to behavioral problems.  pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) and KD—Observational period:  At the age of 9.8 years, pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) was started with a dose of 20 mg/m2 of body surface for three days each week at three-week intervals, administered in 10 cycles. The observational period was 30 days (including two cycles). The pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) effectuated neither significant clinical nor EEG improvement. Therefore, a 3:1 KD was subsequently initiated for three months.  2.5.

The glucose concentration was observed for one month during pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) and three months during the KD. The 30-day period of pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) was compared to the first 30 days of the KD (Figure 5).  4. Discussion  In this case series, the glucose concentrations of three pediatric patients were observed during the KD and pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) as treatment options for drug resistant epilepsies in childhood.",ce838816-6d2d-4cb5-aef8-5615ad46bf72
16,methods16," The most important finding is that hypoglycemia, as a well-known adverse effect of the KD with potential long-term harmful consequences, is especially common in the beginning of the KD and declines significantly thereafter.  Our results are, therefore, in line with our previous findings in a pediatric patient with Dravet Syndrome using an flash glucose monitoring system (FGM) system over an observational period of six months, where a decline in the hypoglycemia rate three months after the beginning of the KD was shown [19]. In addition to emesis and food refusal, hypoglycemia, as an adverse side effect of the KD, was frequently observed in younger children [11]. Especially in the early years, glycemic extremes might lead to alterations in brain structure and functions [12]. Severe hypoglycemia seems to have a negative impact on overall cognitive functioning and especially on attention and memory performance [30,31].",c97cd21d-c9b5-479c-b82f-37038c841784
17,methods17," Additionally, chronic hypoglycemia, often observed in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus, was linked to lower cognitive outcomes in pediatric patients [12]. Moreover, the occurrence of hypoglycemic seizures had a long-term negative effect on various cognitive functions, such as perceptual, motor, memory, or attention performance [13,32].  Due to the high effort of regular blood measurements, glucose concentrations are often not controlled during the KD in clinical practice. The flash glucose monitoring system (FGM) system offers a permanent measurement of glucose concentrations and can be used for 14 days without calibration. Our two patients that were observed over six months, showed a significant decline in the hypoglycemia rate after three months. This is also in line with previous findings describing hypoglycemia, particularly during diet initiation [11].",1da6564d-0212-4dc3-a3cb-80de648b6d4d
18,methods18," Our third patient, who switched from pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) to the KD, had a similar hypoglycemia rate in her three-month observational period compared to the other cases. The rate of significant hypoglycemia (serum glucose level 54 mg/dL and lower) tended to decline in patient 1 and 2 but this was not statistically significant. Patient 3 showed only one significant hypoglycemic event. Furthermore, no significant changes appeared in patient 3, in switching the treatments from pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) to the KD. The hyperglycemic rate was low during pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) with no further hyperglycemic events during the KD. Hypoglycemic events were low during pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) and increased after the beginning of the KD. Interestingly, the hypoglycemia rate in patient 3 was similar to the rate of patient 1 and 2 during the KD in the first three months.",1cd37c7d-55d7-4a98-bf67-966b18508af7
19,methods19,"  None of the children showed seizures throughout the observational period that were linked to hypoglycemia or ketone concentrations beyond the therapeutic range. Greater ketone concentrations within the therapeutic range are essential for an adequate ketosis, which plays a major role in the pathophysiological basis of the KD. However, as we found a weak negative correlation between glucose and ketone concentration, comparable to our previous findings [19], glucose levels should be monitored especially when ketone concentrations are high.  Overall, all three patients responded well to the KD and showed an improvement of the EEG up to seizure freedom. These findings are equivalent to other studies demonstrating the positive effect of the KD in children with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy [3,4,33,34]. An improvement of cognition especially in concentration and memory performance, was reported in all three cases.",8d61054e-80ad-45ec-9d79-3999104994fc
20,methods20," In two patients, motor performance, emotional stability, and sleep quality were also enhanced during the KD.  Patient 3 of our case series received pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) for one month before switching to the KD for three months. Hyperglycemia can occur as a side effect during pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT), and chronic hyperglycemia in particular may have harmful effects on brain development and cognition [22,23,25,26]. In our patient, seven hyperglycemic events were registered in total over the observational period of one month. Interestingly, the hypoglycemic events were only registered on the six days when dexamethasone was introduced. Therefore, no chronic hyperglycemia could be observed, and the registered hyperglycemic events seem to be only a short-term steroid effect on the days it was administered.  Our results showed that hypoglycemia is an adverse effect especially when starting the KD. This is in line with previous studies [19,20].",2d1314ee-5ce3-478f-a74c-318be2020b5b
21,methods21," However, clinical studies reported a good tolerance of induced hypoglycemia [35] and the overall hypoglycemia rates per day of all patients were quite low. Provided that the glucose concentration is observed continuously, especially at the beginning, the KD seems to be a safe and effective treatment. During pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) in patient 3, only a few hyperglycemic events occurred, and solely on the days of dexamethasone application. Using flash glucose monitoring system (FGM) or continuous glucose measurement (continuous glucose measurement (CGM)) systems, might be practical tools to monitor glucose and ketone concentrations when children start a KD or receive pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT), to register trends (increasing or declining concentrations).  The main limitation of this study is the low number of patients. On the one hand, the three cases cannot be compared regarding sex, age, or type of epilepsy.",6b9cf0e4-61ae-4b97-a548-513362c0a539
22,methods22," On the other hand, similar trends in glucose concentrations were evident in all patients, pointing to the transferability of the results to different types of drug resistant epilepsies.  5. Conclusions  The KD is an option in the treatment of pharmaco-resistant epilepsy in children. Hypoglycemic events occurred particularly at the beginning of the KD and declined thereafter; hyperglycemic events during pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT) were rare in our case. To avoid long-term negative impacts of acute and chronic hypoglycemia, glucose concentration should be monitored regularly. The flash glucose monitoring system (FGM) or continuous glucose measurement (CGM) systems might be a practical and easy tool for children with epilepsy who are on the KD or are receiving pulsatile dexamethasone therapy (PDT).
