0,methods0," The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges (strengths weaknesses opportunities and challenges (SWOC)) associated with a KD are highlighted in this review. We searched for articles exploring the advantages and disadvantages of low carbohydrate diets (LCD) with its various variations. Databases from which articles and reports were obtained were PubMed, PubMed Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, MedlinePlus, and Google Scholar database published from 2000 to 2022. The search terms included: low-carbohydrate diet, very-low-carbohydrate diet, high-fat diet, obesity, insulin resistance, insulin resistance-related comorbidities, metabolic syndrome, ketogenic diet, ketogenesis, advantages and disadvantages, physiology of ketogenic diet, and SWOT analysis. A total of 219 articles were cited: 97 review articles, 57 human studies, 48 animal studies, 8 official guidelines and books, and 9 meta-analysis and SWOT-based articles.",5198218f-e56d-4ec2-9eb7-09aaaabb3544
1,methods1," The SWOT methodology highlights all the physical characteristics, associations, and interactions among the advantages and disadvantages of the KD. It also aims to reveal the positive, constructive strengths of KD that work together and the potential complications that need to be identified. It helps participants to decide on its use as a therapeutic regimen. Moreover, the SWOT analysis could highlight the opportunities of its use along with its associated challenges that physicians and participants should be aware of.  3. Physiology and Concept of the Ketogenic Diet  The KD is formulated to induce a state of physiological ketosis to energize the body with ketones rather than glucose [32,33,34]. Given that various ways can induce ketosis, several variations of the KD have been introduced, but with all of them adopting the same hypothesis of essentially restricting carbohydrates (CHO) intake.",c7121706-54fb-4319-ad07-9b33d2834255
2,methods2," A standard very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLchronic kidney diseases (CKD))) mainly comprises carbohydrates (CHO)s that make up less than 50 g/day, around 75% fat, and a sufficient daily protein intake of 1–1.4 g/kg body weight [32,33,35].  The primary source of energy supply to body tissues is carbohydrates (CHO)s. Initially, when dietary carbohydrates (CHO)s are restricted, insulin secretion is significantly diminished, which reduces lipogenesis and fat storage [22,32]. At this point, gluconeogenesis takes over to provide the glucose needed for energy from non-carbohydrates (CHO) sources, mainly lactic acid and glycerol [22,32]. Unfortunately, gluconeogenesis-derived glucose fails to meet the body’s demand. As a result, and with the ongoing depleted insulin secretion and reduced fat storage, the primary source of energy is shifted to consuming fat through hepatic catabolism of fatty acids and KB produced by the liver [22,32,34].",2f85be6a-1b77-441c-99e8-95e284084ea3
3,methods3," Additionally, KB can pass the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to provide energy supplies to the central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)) [22,32,34].  Unlike the life-threatening ketoacidosis associated with diabetes mellitus, this state is termed “nutritional ketosis”, which is benign, physiological, and safe due to the small amounts of KB produced (1–5 mM) that do not affect the normal blood pH of 7.4 [22,32,34]. In contrast, ketoacidosis is often associated with producing a hazardous level of KB, which shifts the blood pH [22,32,34]. The physiological effect of a low-carbohydrate KD in comparison to the high-carbohydrate standard diet is presented in Figure 1.  4. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Challenges (strengths weaknesses opportunities and challenges (SWOC)) Analysis of Ketogenic Diets  4.1.",9e62c94c-4868-414e-86fb-22527c462e7a
4,methods4," Strengths “S”  T2DM, ischemic heart diseases (ischemic heart diseases (IHD)), dementia, and some types of cancers are examples of prevalent diseases that can be prevented by diet rather than drugs. The different mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of these chronic diseases include glycation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, IR, and inflammation [36,37,38]. This section explores the strengths of a KD and how it can alleviate these mechanisms.  4.1.1. Ketogenic Diets Improve Insulin Sensitivity  The reduced response to insulin in the body is known as insulin resistance (IR) [39]. The primary etiology of hyperglycemia can predispose to increased glycation and oxidative stress [39]. The overconsumption of carbohydrates (CHO) and vegetable oils with the lack of physical activity that accompanies a modern lifestyle contribute to IR [39]. Insulin insensitivity triggers the pancreas to release more insulin for further blood glucose control [39].",2b696f9c-9290-47b5-a5e4-f9b1cc6c9490
5,methods5," The primary target organs for insulin action are the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscles [39].  Insulin stimulates hepatocytes to decrease glucose production and increase de novo lipogenesis [39]. In the IR state, insulin fails to control the release of glucose in the blood as gluconeogenesis cannot be inhibited [39]. Hyperglycemia stimulates a compensatory release of insulin by pancreatic β-cells, which worsens IR [39]. At the same time, de novo lipogenesis continues to release triglycerides, which travels in the bloodstream in the form of VLDL-cholesterol or gets deposited within hepatocytes [39]. This metabolic disturbance leads to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)) [39]. Consequently, IR contributes to hypertriglyceridemia; and impairs the uptake of triglycerides (TAGs) into adipose tissue, increasing circulating TAGs [39].",959582fe-b9f9-4eeb-ad74-f0241bb0d288
6,methods6,"  Furthermore, insulin loses its ability to translocate Glut-4 onto the muscle cell surface, decreasing glucose uptake [39]. Decreased insulin level is associated with increasing its sensitivity [40]. Hence, the effect of dietary carbohydrates (CHO) restriction, including sugars and fructose-rich fruits, on IR has been extensively studied. KD has been shown to control blood glucose, decrease the need for insulin release [39], and improve IR by lowering the glycemic response generated by carbohydrates (CHO) in studies done on adult diabetic patients and in obese children and adolescents [41,42].  4.1.2. Ketogenic Diets Decrease Glycation  Glycation is the process of adding a carbohydrates (CHO) to protein, lipid, or DNA [43]. It is an irreversible, spontaneous, and non-enzymatic process that can be considered normal and pathological. When it occurs between a carbohydrates (CHO) molecule and a free amino group in a protein, it forms glycated proteins called “Amadori” products [44].",4a35dbdb-7d94-4961-a321-170302382468
7,methods7," These products can undergo further rearrangements leading to the production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) [43,44]. It is not to be confused with glycosylation, an enzyme-controlled physiological process that occurs during the formation of glycoproteins [43]. Glycation can happen endogenously and exogenously [43].  Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and the lack of blood glucose control cause a hyperglycemic state that enhances the glycation process, eventually leading to the loss or modification of protein function. AGEs accumulate in various tissues such as arteries, lenses of the eyes, and neurons [43], then promote atherosclerosis, cataract, dementia and aggravate various symptoms of diabetes [44,45].  KD stabilizes blood glucose levels and decreases its spikes, consequently improving AGEs. Restricting carbohydrates (CHO) intake in patients with IR and T2DM to <30% of daily calories improves the level of HbA1C, one of the glycation-derived AGEs [46].",a5e591d7-e841-4ce8-a32a-8773e195ce7f
8,methods8," Additionally, in another study, carbohydrates (CHO) restriction reduced AGEs in the kidney [47]. In addition, another study conducted on mice has looked at the long-term effects of carbohydrates (CHO) restriction and showed a significant reduction in different AGEs in the kidney [47].  4.1.3. Ketogenic Diets Ameliorate Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress  Mitochondria are required for metabolic balance in all multicellular eukaryotes because it is the central organelle responsible for cellular energy production [48]. Mitochondrial malfunction causes excessive weariness and other common symptoms in all chronic diseases [48]. This mitochondrial dysfunction can happen due to the loss of electrochemical transmembrane potential balance, malfunction of the electron transport chain (electron transport chain (ETC)), or the lack of metabolites transferring to mitochondria, which collectively can reduce adenosine-5′-triphosphate (adenosine 5′ triphosphate (ATP)) production [49].",1771af2d-2815-49a7-a2b8-846f666f8efe
9,methods9,"  Oxidative stress is caused by a mismatch between cells’ creation and buildup of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) and the biological system’s ability to detoxify these reactive products [50]. While high levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation promote oxidative damage, low levels are essential for enhancing protective defense mechanisms, a phenomenon known as mitohormesis [36]. Protein phosphorylation, transcription factor activation, death, and immunity, are physiological processes that depend on a low amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and presence inside cells [51]. On the other hand, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production negatively affects proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids [52]. The role of oxidative stress in various illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, metabolic disorders, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), is well-known [52].",a1d9982b-cbf0-49f8-99d9-a87e74f424da
10,methods10,"  In 2014, a study on rats showed that KD enhances antioxidant defense, but insufficient evidence links the outcomes to mitohormesis [36]. At first, a KD can promote the production of small amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which subsequently activates the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant pathway, the main driver of detoxification genes [53,54,55]. The Nrf2 pathway was also activated by injection of KB [56].  The KD is thought to lower oxidative stress through a variety of methods. One possible mechanism is the scavenging properties of KB [57]. The circulating KB are Acetoacetate (AcAc) and β-hydroxybutyrate (ßOHB). They can scavenge various types of reactive oxygen species (ROS), prevent adenosine 5′ triphosphate (ATP) decline in neurons, and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by iodoacetate (iodoacetate (IOA)), a glycolysis inhibitor [57].",bfa4fc37-9309-45e7-97d8-add3c37256e7
11,methods11," The addition of ßOHB and AcAc to glutamate-exposed dissociated neurons or calcium-exposed mitochondria, respectively, prevented O2 buildup and enhanced Complex I-driven state III respiration [58].  The KD also enhanced the production of the cytosolic and mitochondrial antioxidant proteins, superoxide dismutase (SOD-I & II), and NADPH Quinone Dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) in a rat model [59]. These enzymes are O2 scavengers and under genomic control of Nrf2 signaling [60]. Moreover, the antioxidant glutathione (glutathione (GSH)) synthesis is elevated with KD consumption [53,54,55,61]. In the hippocampus of rats, ßOHB was observed to prevent hypoglycemia-induced lipoperoxidation, which is an index of oxidative damage [57]. Additionally, KD raises the total antioxidant capacity, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase activities were raised in the hippocampus homogenate of rats [62]. Moreover, animals with higher blood ßOHB concentrations (1.",2afe3a21-b136-414f-84bf-abb1a22186b0
12,methods12,"2 mM) were protected from paraquat-induced oxidative damage to proteins and lipids, as seen by a decrease in protein carbonyls, the toxic compound 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and lipid peroxides levels [63]. Therefore, KD can enhance mitochondrial functions, activate various protective antioxidant pathways, and decrease oxidative stress by eventually reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [54,55,61].  4.1.4. Ketogenic Diets Have Anti-Inflammatory Effects  Inflammation is accompanied by activating various immunological and non-immunological cells that protect host cells from pathogens [38]. The effect of a KD in ameliorating inflammation was proven in multiple human and animal studies. The KB mediate their anti-inflammatory effect by inducing the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines and lowering pro-inflammatory ones [64,65,66]. ßOHB was shown to suppress the stress-related inflammasome production in the endoplasmic reticulum [67,68].",b5faf603-8bf2-4059-9939-9f630be9e281
13,methods13," Moreover, ßOHB transport to the brain via the BBB is facilitated by the unique expression of its transporter, monocarboxylate (MCT1), on endothelial cells [69]. Once in the brain, ßOHB not only supplies energy but also activates the hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2), reducing neuroinflammation [69]. KD has also been found to induce HCA2 and create a neuroprotective phenotype in bone marrow-derived macrophages that infiltrate the brain [70]. HCA2 suppresses the inflammatory promoter nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) in macrophages [71]. Moreover, it activates the neuroprotective macrophage phenotype similar to Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) synthesis by Cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) [72] which provides anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects [73]. Additionally, PGD2 metabolite inhibits IkappaB kinase (IκB kinase or IKK), the primary activator of NF-κB [71].",08f57bd6-0aec-46c7-9a75-5d01289f7c0a
14,methods14," Furthermore, the fasting-like state induced by KD contributes to neuroprotection by increasing corticosterone levels, enhancing apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes, exaggerating autophagy, and oligodendrocyte regeneration [74].  4.1.5. Ketogenic Diets Combat Malignancy-Associated Features  Primarily, cancer cells feed on glucose to survive and proliferate through accelerated glycolysis, a phenomenon known as the “Warburg effect” [75]. The KD has been studied as a simple, tolerable, and non-costly way to combat this effect and delay tumorigenesis [53]. Studies have also revealed that the KD can protect healthy cells from the toxic effects of chemotherapy while promoting toxicity in cancer cells [76]. In addition, the KD can diminish a tumor’s growth and induce an anti-inflammatory effect in mice [53,77].",525729b2-ccba-4ff8-92d7-aa8dbcbde09d
15,methods15," Studies have also proven that ketones and a KD can have an anti-brain cancer effect by promoting a metabolic state with anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and pro-apoptotic properties that helps to shrink tumor growth in the brain [78,79]. The insulin-activated phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway regulates the proliferation and differentiation of cells and controls various metabolic pathways [80]. Mutations in the PIK3CA gene, encoding PI3K, lead to its activated signaling and are considered a hallmark of cancer [81,82]. Selective PI3K inhibitors have been studied as a promising anti-cancer drug [83]. The pharmacological inhibition of PI3K disturbs glucose homeostasis and leads to a state of transient hyperglycemia that can be rapidly resolved by the pancreatic insulin feedback [84,85]. However, in patients with IR, hyperglycemia may be exaggerated that requires treatment cessation [84].",2fa2676c-441e-4ff0-8562-8834e195983d
16,methods16," It has been believed that the PI3K inhibitor-induced insulin feedback weakened the treatment effect by reactivating PI3K signaling [84]. Studies have shown that cancer patients who are candidates for PI3K inhibitors might benefit from the KD as it interrupts hyperinsulinemia, which might boost the effects of PI3K inhibitors [53,84].  4.1.6. Ketogenic Diets Improve Blood Lipid Parameters  Various guidelines have proposed that the ideal diet for cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction is a low-fat diet (7–10%); hence, prescribing low-fat diets with nearly 60% of calories obtained from carbohydrates (CHO) is a standard for CV patients [86,87]. Consuming fat-rich diets has been believed to adversely affect cardiovascular outcomes, and saturated fats mainly increase low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol LDL-C, thus promoting intravascular fat deposition [86].",17c1c588-33e0-41f6-bf1d-2141596b1585
17,methods17," LDL-C and total cholesterol (TC) were previously considered the best biomarkers to assess CV outcomes, but nowadays apolipoprotein-B (apo-B), TC/HDL ratio, small dense LDL particles (sdLDL) have come out as biomarkers with better value in assessment [88]. Accordingly, researchers investigated the effect of macro-nutrients on other CV biomarkers [89].  A study in 2006 on 178 men that analyzed the effect of the dietary intake of around 25% carbohydrates (CHO) with a 7–10% of saturated fats, found that the increase in LDL-C was secondary to elevated large-sized LDL particles, which are less atherogenic [90]. In contrast, the more atherogenic sdLDL was lowered [90]. Moreover, another prospective-cohort PURE study has proven that higher saturated fat does have an LDL-C elevating effect.",3e836b24-08c7-4de4-a5db-c7a8895ff223
18,methods18," Yet, it lowered triglycerides (TG) and TC/HDL ratio, increased the protective HDL levels, and a carbohydrates (CHO)-restricted diet with high fats had effects on atherogenic biomarkers that are contradictory to other conventional beliefs [91]. For a good view of the effects of KD on CV biomarkers, studies have explored CV outcomes with nutritional ketosis induced by a daily carbohydrates (CHO) intake of <50 g. They found that KD remarkably reduced TG with no significant alterations in TC, LDL, or HDL [92,93]. Additionally, an low carbohydrate diets (LCD) was seen to ameliorate dyslipidemia associated with MetS, as observed biochemically and histologically in rats [94].  Along these lines, the findings mentioned above have highlighted that the conventional lipid profiles might not be the best indicator of KD effects on CV outcomes, and the analysis of comprehensive lipid fractions might be necessary for proper assessment.  4.1.7.",cac1cfa0-8a42-4d5f-bdf9-00f1c6d3fb60
19,methods19," Effects of Ketogenic Diets on the Epigenome  Epigenetics is the study of how non-genetic factors alter or modify gene expression. Alterations such as DNA methylation and histones modification can be environment driven [95]. Studies have shown that diet causes epigenetic modifications later in life [96,97,98]. Certain types of low-carbohydrate (ketogenic) foods, such as fibers, berries, and rich in long-chain fatty acids, were shown to positively impact epigenetic alterations like methylation patterns [95] by increasing adenosine levels, which blocks DNA methylation [99,100]. ßOHB upregulated detoxifying genes by inhibiting class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs) in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in increased histone acetylation regardless of whether ßOHB is raised by fasting, calorie restriction, or infusion [61,63].",89767d26-2aad-4325-9107-d388f69d0021
20,methods20," These findings have driven the interest of researchers to explore KD’s effects on other epigenetic activities, such as telomeres’ length and chromatin structure [86].  4.1.8. Ketogenic Diets and Gut Microbiota  A KD modifies the gut microbiome’s composition to prevent inflammation and diminish IR. It is also reported that the KD decreased Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes in a study done on a murine model [101]. Moreover, it increased A. muciniphila, Parabacteroides spp., while decreasing alpha diversity in another study on mice [102]. Another study showed that it increased Akkermansia muciniphila and Lactobacillus and decreased the inflammatory bacteria Desulfovibrio and Turicibacter [103]. In addition, the KD-induced ßOHB, which has anti-inflammatory effects, is due to its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome [77]. Moreover, ßOHB modifies microbial-mediated immunomodulation and directly influences immune responses [104].",77e164b5-4722-4dfe-8ab1-11bb3e3e7921
21,methods21,"  The impact of the KD on inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)) has been also looked into, yet the results were inconsistent between studies. In colitis-induced mice models that were fed with either a KD, low carbohydrate diets (LCD), or a normal diet, the KD was shown to distinctly alleviate inflammatory colitis by altering the gut microbiota, increasing Akkermansia, protecting the intestinal barrier function, and decreasing the formation of various inflammatory cytokines and RORγt + CD3– group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) [105]. These findings might have reflected an opportunity for the KD as an adjuvant therapy for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, other studies have shown contradictory effects.",74263517-e1c2-43ff-8c9d-62d2dd97e4c3
22,methods22," In another mouse model with induced-colitis, the KD significantly aggravated the disease, induced weight loss, shortened colon length on histological examination, upregulated various inflammatory cytokines, increased GUT permeability, and reduced the expression of genes involved in intestinal epithelial barrier which disrupted its protective functions [106]. The impact of the KD on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been extensively studied though and might be an interesting area for future research [107].  4.2. Weaknesses “W”  Although the KD reduces body weight and improves IR, it has poor long-term tolerability from its various side effects. Adverse effects can be short-term and described as “keto flu” by the public [108]. Keto flu constitutes a temporary phase of symptoms experienced by around 30% of individuals within the first few weeks that follow the initiation of the KD [108].",e11f6011-857e-4f57-9ec1-12c2188acd71
23,methods23," It is accompanied by gastritis, diarrhea or constipation, gastrointestinal pain, nausea, bloating, headache, muscular cramps and weakness, dizziness, body aches, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue [108]. Why keto flu is experienced by some and not all individuals is unknown; however, the electrolytes imbalance with high sodium, potassium, and water losses associated with carbohydrates (CHO) withdrawal are believed to be the keto-flu promoters [109]. Furthermore, with KD initiation, people with diabetes may experience hypoglycemic attacks if they are non-compliant with their medications [110]. Some studies conducted in geriatric- and pediatric-age groups have shown that after the first month of following the KD, long-term adverse effects have also been reported. These adverse events include cardiomyopathy, osteopenia, iron deficiency anemia, nephrolithiasis, hepatic steatosis, renal stones formation, and nutritional deficiencies [111,112,113].",be1444c4-f490-4612-bfc4-c9283755b2e8
24,methods24," The rare KD-associated cardiomyopathy could be explained by the prolonged poor dietary intake and food refusal that causes energy failure that leads to deficiency of minor elements, such as selenium [114,115], and electrolytes disturbances, such as hypokalemia [108], which are both responsible for cardiomyopathy [108,114,115]. Moreover, the loss of bone mineral density induced by prolonged KD intake have been proposed to be caused by bone microstructural abnormalities that promote bone absorption via activation of osteoclasts, rather than inhibition of bone formation mediated by osteoblasts [116,117]. Additionally, the KD negatively affected athletes’ bone remodeling and modeling markers [118]. This section throws a beam of light on further details of the main weaknesses and harms of a KD.  4.2.1. Poor Weight Maintenance and Rebound Weight Gain  Hyperinsulinemia is believed to promote weight gain in various ways.",79c4ba3d-aa65-4cb0-ab58-ffc2d28f79f6
25,methods25," Hyperinsulinemia stimulates the uptake and storage of glucose within the adipose tissue, liver, and muscles, ending in weight gain [119]. It also elicits a sodium retention effect by activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, which enhances sodium absorption from renal tubules, subsequently expanding extracellular fluid volume and causing weight gain [119,120]. Since food intake triggers glucose metabolism and simultaneous insulin release, the effects of low carbohydrate diets (LCD) on insulin levels have been explored [121]. carbohydrates (CHO) restriction was accompanied by a lower pancreatic insulin release [119,121], inhibiting renal tubular sodium and water retention [119]. The majority of people following a KD notice an initial rapid weight loss of 4–5 kg within the first two weeks, mainly from alleviating the action of insulin on renal tubules, causing fluid excretion [22,120].",15921ac1-8983-4682-853b-608044ed41e5
26,methods26," However, at least 18 weeks of adherence to a KD is required to obtain the target weight by losing fat and excess retained water [121]. Various reasons to discontinue a KD have been documented, such as the reluctance to cut out carbohydrates (CHO), the poor control of children’s dietary habits, medical reasons interfering with compliance, and issues related to caregivers providing the diet [122]. Moreover, the use of dietary interventions in general for weight loss management is subject to rebound weight gain after their initial success in weight reduction; hence, achieving long-term weight maintenance might be difficult for the majority of obese individuals [123].  4.2.2. Nutritional Deficiencies  carbohydrates (CHO) could be considered an essential source of various vitamins and minerals [124]. Losing weight requires macronutrients restriction for a particular duration, which can sometimes be long enough to cause nutritional deficiencies [125].",cc74c61c-3524-4935-b202-74eddb91f313
27,methods27," Thiamine (vitamin B1), folate (vitamin B9), magnesium, calcium, and iron, have all been reported to be deficient following KD initiation [125]. Excluding dairy products from some KD variations leads to iodine deficiency [125]. Life-threatening conditions have been reported with long-term KD consumption, such as optic neuropathies [112] and Wernicke’s encephalopathy [126]. Additionally, maternal folate deficiency from a KD may increase the risk of fetal deformities [127,128]. Moreover, KD-induced osteopenia can be explained by the KD-associated vitamin D deficiency related to malnutrition from diet intolerance that eventually contributes to bone demineralization [114,116,117].  4.2.3. Electrolyte Disturbances  Once carbohydrates (CHO) is dramatically reduced from the diet, electrolytes are managed differently by the body.",c5ecacc9-ba42-48d2-88de-f93cf570e921
28,methods28," According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)), sodium and potassium are critical minerals needed by the body to function appropriately, and they work simultaneously. When KB are utilized as a source of energy instead of glucose, insulin level drops [108]. Hypoinsulinemia is associated with the inability to retain salt and water by the kidneys, according to the Cleveland clinic, which leads to the loss of sodium in the urine, and the subsequent hyponatremia [40,108,111]. Moreover, due to the close interconnection between sodium and potassium, urinary potassium excretion increases, leading to hypokalemia [40,108,111,129]. This effect is usually accompanied by other electrolyte disturbances, which collectively contribute to “keto flu” symptoms explained earlier [108,111].  4.2.4.",c4a7769b-805d-4e13-ba9e-497891e506e3
29,methods29," Renal Stones and Renal Impairment  Researchers have warned that while low-carbohydrate/high-protein diets promote short-term weight loss, this type of diet could be less effective in the long run and may even be harmful to overall health. Protein-rich foods can also be rich in fats, which raises the risk of heart disease and T2DM. low carbohydrate diets (LCD), such as those rich in fruits and vegetables, are linked to a high predisposition to renal stones formation [130]. Studies on healthy individuals have observed that a six-week LC high-protein diet elevated the acid load on the kidneys, predisposing to nephrolithiasis. Animal protein has been proven to increase oxalate excretion in the urine, a molecule that forms kidney stones when combined with calcium and other substances [131]. Children who followed the KD for a prolonged period to suppress persistent grand mal seizures are predisposed to a higher risk of calcium oxalate and uric acid renal stones [132].",9e9ee4ef-edb6-43da-a53b-61e71fd63bb5
30,methods30," This danger in an adult undergoing a protracted ketogenic attempt is similarly substantial [130]. On the other hand, other studies have shown that the risk of KD-associated nephrolithiasis can be diminished if the KD is implemented in a perfect and standardized protocol with strict and continuous follow-up [110,133]. A KD formulated with a moderate daily protein intake of 0.8–1 g/Kg (90–150 g/day) as indicated in the Atkins diet closely resembles what an average adult usually consumes [110] and is generally well-tolerated with no adverse effects on bone, kidneys, or other health indicators. Protein intakes of more than the maximum suggestion of 1 g/Kg were assumed to have a harmful influence on health. While some evidence exists that more significant protein consumption can raise glomerular filtration rate [133], there is no evidence that this normal physiologic response is linked to gradual kidney function loss in healthy individuals [134].  4.2.5.",49cd185f-deec-4d51-81b8-c52cbc980169
31,methods31," Effects on Embryonic Growth during Pregnancy  The KD has been used by childbearing-aged women during pregnancy for weight control; however, its safety as a gestational diet have been questioned. A poorly formulated gestational diet might negatively impact fetal developmental adaptation, predisposing to various disorders later in life [135]. Thus, the KD was studied in a murine model for its effects on prenatal embryonic organ development [135,136]. The development of multiple organs in mice embryos whose mothers were fed the KD was compared to the embryonic development of those on a standard diet [135]. Significant alterations in embryonic growth were observed in those on the KD as seen by measuring the embryonic and organs volumes’ percentages [135].",141232c4-8716-4f4e-b4b2-e3d656738d6e
32,methods32," By the end of organ development, the larger percentage of the embryos was occupied by the brain, heart, and liver, which showed subsequent volume reduction by the time of parturition, and a further reduction of postnatal organs volume as compared to an average adult mouse [135]. These changes can be explained by different energy substrate preferences in various organs and can predispose to later abnormal functions [135]. The KD was also shown to reduce maternal fertility and increase the risk for fatal ketoacidosis in another mouse model [136]. The American Diabetes Association (American Diabetes Association (ADA)) recommends a non-ketogenic high-energy diet for women with gestational diabetes [137]. This is because the formation of KB normally increases during the third trimester due to pregnancy-associated IR and the higher fetal demand for energy [138].",99516f58-0a8c-48d0-873b-417eba012f46
33,methods33," Ketones are able to passively diffuse from the mother to the fetus by crossing the placenta, and maternal KB elevation was shown to increase the risk of fetal cardiac abnormalities, reduced intelligence, and oligohydramnios [138]. Despite the rare documentation of the KD effects on humans during pregnancy and breastfeeding, life-threatening ketoacidosis was reported on a lactating mother on a strict ketogenic diet [139].  4.2.6. Growth Retardation in Children  Another adverse effect of the KD is short stature in children [140]. The growth of these children was observed to fall into the tenth percentile or lower, which implies that something is fundamentally wrong with sustained ketosis that impairs average growth [141]. Other studies have found no adverse effects on children’s growth and development who followed a short-term KD for less than six months [142,143].",20c3675e-1443-4bce-bc9f-0083b4532847
34,methods34," In spite of that, other studies on the long-term implementation of KD have reported either a decrease of height alone [144] or of both weight and height [145]. This potential growth retardation effect seen with long-term KD consumption can be explained mainly by inadequate caloric intake [146]. Such inconsistencies indicate that this concern deserves further analysis [140]. Furthermore, insulin is essential for preserving the response of liver to growth hormone (GH), and the reduction of hepatic GH receptor (GH receptor (GHR)) expression is associated with insulin deficiency [147], and the KD was observed to suppress the expression of hepatic GH receptor (GHR) in rats and impair the central regulation of GH release [148], which could be another explanation to the retarded growth in children fed with the KD.  4.2.7. Effects on Intestinal Flora  Despite the previously highlighted benefit of the KD on the gut microbiome, certain KD variations may have opposing effects.",c2d6e6e3-0052-40e7-9b1c-88a53bac3460
35,methods35," Lifestyle aspects such as sleeping patterns, exercise, antibiotic usage, and even nutrition may influence the genetic make-up of a microbiome. Because these bacteria differ in their capacity to collect energy from food, they can modify our reaction to diverse food sources, influencing the postprandial glucose response (PPGR) [86]. It is vital to figure out how the gut microbiota and nutrition interact, how that connection relates to general health, and whether new dietary changes, like the KD, would have a good or a detrimental impact overall on the microbiome needs to be explored. Whole grains are essential for overall health and play a vital role in forming a healthy microbiota [149]. As a result, low carbohydrate diets (LCD)s are more likely to be nutritionally deficient due to the lack of fibers, essential vitamins, minerals, and iron [150]. Moreover, they might be accompanied by insufficient intake of whole grains needed to maintain a healthy microbiota [150].",0ec9266e-fd6d-42dd-9ef4-0efa1cc9fc8e
36,methods36," This hypothesis is based on The Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII)) that looked at nutrient intake while consuming various quantities of carbohydrates (CHO) [151]. Strong evidence regarding the long-term consequences of the KD on gut flora is currently limited.  4.2.8. Ketone-Proteins Adducts Formation  As explained in a previous section, one justification for using the KD is minimizing glycation adducts that promote inflammation. However, an overlooked risk associated with the KD is related to the reactivity of KB toward proteins [152]. While excessive glucose reacts with proteins, causing AGE products that promote inflammation and vascular damage, ketones were found to generate the same modifications in proteins leading to the same glucose-associated vascular damage and by the exact same mechanisms [152], which may have adverse health outcomes.  4.3.",27b9b70b-aa81-4a00-9193-66d3ac548764
37,methods37," Opportunities “O”  Despite the escalating evidence of the various drawbacks of the KD, its proven positive role in multiple disorders made KD an attractive approach to be further explored in several areas. The most critical conditions in which KD has provided an opportunity to positively contribute to their outcomes will be outlined in this section.  4.3.1. Weight Loss  For any dietary regimen to be successful, strict adherence is essential. When low carbohydrate diets (LCD) was compared to a low-fat diet and a Mediterranean caloric-restricted diet over two years, the highest weight loss was observed among those following an low carbohydrate diets (LCD), especially when their diet was initiated by a complete two months of nutritional ketosis (<20 g/day) with increasing carbohydrates (CHO) over stages [153].",8a97a419-0035-485c-85eb-2621e07f8135
38,methods38," While various diets rely on caloric restriction, a KD provides an ideal opportunity for those who are unable to restrict their calories since it has the benefit of promoting weight loss while eating with satisfaction [86]. Despite the non-caloric-restriction nature of a KD, it provides the weight loss benefits of an low carbohydrate diets (LCD) [86].  4.3.2. Personalization with Safety  Like any other therapeutic regimen, a KD may be suitable for some individuals more than others and contraindicated in several situations. The expanding body of research conducted over the past years has highlighted the physiological and molecular mechanisms by which KD functions; therefore, it has given the opportunity to safely implement a KD that is personalized for each individual at the lowest possible risk [154].",7acf8ca6-b7b9-4f0e-936b-407dc05a71d0
39,methods39," Additionally, the availability of well-trained health care practitioners with appropriate awareness of the KD-associated safety alerts, and updated knowledge of the recommendations necessary to initiate a safe and effective regimen, has also lowered the chances of inappropriately following an unsuitable weight loss regimen that has more losses than gains [154].  The many variations of the KD enabled more effective methods to be implemented based on patients’ age, behavior, preferable amounts of certain macronutrients, and their desire to follow an on and off dietary course [155]. For example, the medium-chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (MCTD)) allowed children to follow the KD due to its higher carbohydrates (CHO) and protein content with a lower fat intake.",529076b7-c315-40af-ab30-67f22c31a4c0
40,methods40," Targeted ketogenic diets (Targeted ketogenic diets (TKD)) is another variation that allows the consumption of carbohydrates (CHO) around the workout time for those performing physical exercise to maintain a better performance without altering their ketotic ketonic state [156]. At the same time, cyclical ketogenic diets (chronic kidney diseases (CKD)) permit periods of high carbohydrates (CHO) consumption to alternate with periods of a classical KD [156]. The intervening carbohydrates (CHO)-rich periods replenish muscle glycogen stores to sustain the function of exercising muscles [156,157].  4.3.3. Glycemic Control and Diabetes  Given the well-explained role of the KD in improving insulin sensitivity, it provided an excellent opportunity for glycemic control and the treatment of IR-associated conditions. By lowering the glycemic response generated by carbohydrates (CHO) and improving IR, the KD can improve both insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM/T1DM) and T2DM [27,41,42,87].",75ba507f-983b-4faa-befd-68bfa8f9a9ae
41,methods41," When the effects of carbohydrates (CHO)-restricted KD were assessed in various studies, and among those with T2DM and non-diabetics with different degrees of obesity, the KD was able to lower fasting plasma glucose, improve insulin sensitivity, and improve glycemic control as observed by hemoglobin A1c levels [158,159,160]. Hence, the KD has provided an opportunity to reduce the need for anti-diabetic medications [158,159,160].  Currently, there is limited evidence in the literature regarding the effects of the KD on T1DM, yet studies have proven that those with T1DM could also benefit from the KD. In a randomized crossover study that compared low carbohydrate diets (LCD) to high-carbohydrate diet over 1 week in T1DM participants on insulin pump therapy, those on low carbohydrate diets (LCD) had lower mean blood glucose levels [161].",1022fed0-75f0-411a-8216-9bbd0328df1f
42,methods42," low carbohydrate diets (LCD) had significantly lower average daily blood glucose levels, euglycemia, less glycemic variability, and a lower need for daily doses of insulin [161]. Other studies on T1DM patients following the KD have also reported good glucose control with a nearly normal HbA1C level (5.3–5.7%), a low rate of severe adverse events, and a higher satisfaction [27,87]. However, many patients have also reported frequent hypoglycemic episodes [27], which indicates that close blood glucose monitoring in those patients is essential.  4.3.4. Adjuvant Therapy in Cancer  As clarified in an earlier section, KD combats the Warburg effect, delays tumor growth, and elicits anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and pro-apoptotic features associated with malignancies [53,78,79]. Various studies have explored the effects of a KD on different types of malignancies and proved its role as a novel therapeutic approach in such cases.",97f3ebec-c977-449f-8b4b-f64f2d4b54ac
43,methods43," Gastric cancer is one of the cancers that have been shown to benefit from a KD are gastric cancers; when mice were injected with human gastric adenocarcinoma cells and subsequently fed with a KD, tumor growth was delayed as compared to mice consuming a standard diet [162].  Glioblastoma, an aggressive type of brain cancer, has been associated with a short survival duration after the failure of conventional anti-cancer therapies [163,164]. Glioblastoma cells are highly dependent on glucose for obtaining the energy needed to proliferate. Hence, low carbohydrate diets (LCD)s have lengthened glioblastoma patients’ survival time [164,165]. Studies have shown that Glioblastoma cells cannot consume ketones as a source of energy when glucose is absent due to their low expression of ketolytic enzymes, unlike normal brain cells [163,164]. Therefore, nutritional ketosis selectively arrested cancer growth and did not elicit the same function on normal brain cells [164,166].",32d4867e-b1b8-4b4f-9084-ed411e198154
44,methods44,"  The KD has been studied on various cancer models, such as pancreatic, breast, endometrial cancers, and leukemia, as an approach to prevent the unwanted insulin feedback in patients treated with PI3K inhibitors, which indicated that the KD helps to overcome the drug resistance [53,84]. These findings suggested the opportunity a KD provides for cancer patients in augmenting the efficacy of their treatment [53,84].  4.3.5. Neuroprotection  It is known that excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction are central features of degenerative brain diseases, which result in harmful cerebral effects, including DNA, lipid, and protein damage. The KD is believed to provide a great opportunity for neuroprotection through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, in addition to its ability to ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction as previously explained.",4e870302-5182-43ed-aa23-3f34cd235be1
45,methods45," These effects are primarily due to nutritional ketosis, reduced blood glucose concentration, and decreased insulin/glucagon ratio [113]. Another possible mechanism of KD-associated neuroprotection is its energetic property. ßOHB has been shown to provide more energy for the brain per oxygen unit than glucose [167]. The induction of antioxidant enzymes in the hippocampus of experimental animals by KD-induced nutritional ketosis has also been reported.  Nutritional ketosis has provided an option to control seizures as a non-pharmacological treatment in various forms of medication-refractory epilepsy [32,168]. The multiple mechanisms by which the KD acts to improve brain functions have enlightened the prospect of using the KD in other neurological disorders [113]. The KD has been investigated in animal and clinical studies to treat some neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and provided good results.",96ca5484-d109-4ae9-919a-79f0275395f5
46,methods46," These neurological diseases include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [169], traumatic brain injury (traumatic brain injury (TBI)) [170], and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and AD diseases [79,171].  One of the most promising opportunities for treating AD is the KD [32]. It was observed that a long-term administration of KB has a protective and therapeutic role in treating AD patients [172]. The KD was shown to decrease the production of Amyloid Precursor Protein (Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)), and consequently the amyloid peptide, as well as activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR)), which ultimately suppresses systemic inflammation [173]. Moreover, the KD improved the cognitive functions of an experimental mouse model of AD by reducing beta-amyloid and highly phosphorylated tau proteins in its brain.",955831fc-337a-4752-a053-658b55f7788a
47,methods47," The benefits of the KD were also proven concerning the motor functions of the experimental animals [174,175]. Enhanced apoptosis associated with mitochondrial dysfunction is the cornerstone of AD pathogenesis [176], and the KD was seen to inhibit apoptosis in the hippocampus and stabilize nerve-cell synapse functions [177].  It was shown that ßOHB acts in vitro as a neuroprotective agent against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (methyl 4 phenyl 1 2 3 6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)) toxicity on dopaminergic neurons [174]. methyl 4 phenyl 1 2 3 6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is responsible for the death of dopaminergic substantia nigra cells, producing a syndrome identical to Parkinson’s disease.",59509d3c-8f0a-4b4c-a6ec-214a1d2d4edd
48,methods48," In addition, beta-hydroxy-lactate reduced the neurotoxicity of methyl 4 phenyl 1 2 3 6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) by improving cellular respiration, adenosine 5′ triphosphate (ATP) production, and consequently enhanced motor skills, together with an increased dopamine volume in the mesencephalon [178]. Hence, Parkinson’s disease patients have also gained benefits from nutritional ketosis.  Moreover, the KD and KB can aid the regeneration of demyelinated axons, the primary pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) [179]. Hence, it has shown promising results in managing MS, especially the relapsing/remitting type [180,181]. The inhibitory effect of the KD on low-grade inflammation and neuroinflammation and its immunomodulatory effects explain its role in treating MS [182].  4.3.6.",24d9ac16-2703-408b-bad5-8e5778f6fad0
49,methods49," Cardiovascular Risk Factor Control  carbohydrates (CHO) restriction was shown to control various cardiovascular risk factors; hence, it can be an excellent chance for those with higher risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The known positive effects of the KD on blood lipids were observed even with high saturated fats intake [183]. As various studies have established, the KD can lower TAGs and total cholesterol while elevating the atheroprotective high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) [184,185]. The previously highlighted shifting of LDL size with the KD to the larger, less atherogenic LDL was the most interesting [183]. However, controversy persists; studies have demonstrated that a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet may worsen the lipid profile in diabetic patients, although glycemic control improved with hypoglycemic medications [27]. Moreover, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials has analyzed the effects of the KD on CV risk factors, including blood pressure [186].",4e52fbba-6324-4955-9df8-436992fe869a
50,methods50," A more considerable reduction in diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) was observed in groups following a KD than those on low-fat diets [186]. In contrast, another meta-analysis found no differences in systolic or diastolic blood pressures between those on a KD and those on a low-fat diet [187]. Whether carbohydrates (CHO) restriction controls blood pressure cannot be ascertained. However, whether these positive effects of the KD on CV health are sustainable in the long run without causing harm is unknown.  4.3.7. Treatment of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome  Polycystic ovarian syndrome (Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)) is a common endocrinological disorder of reproductive-aged women [188]. It is presented with menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, infertility, and excess androgens [188]. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is linked to obesity, and other metabolic disturbances, such as IR/T2DM, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and MetS [188].",c0d3b429-33ee-4932-a6e0-477effa64e05
51,methods51," Its pathophysiological mechanism is mainly based on excess secretion of androgens from ovaries and adrenal glands that is due to impaired ovarian steroid hormones’ synthesis as well as hyperinsulinemia [189]. IR is a key feature in those with Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) [189]. In tissues where steroidogenesis occurs, in this case ovaries and adrenal cortex, insulin is necessary to augment the effects of hormones that promote steroid hormones’ synthesis. Therefore, the IR and hyperinsulinemia associated with Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) trigger excessive steroidogenesis, causing increased testosterone levels [189]. These mechanisms are confirmed by the observed clinical improvement in patients with Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) with weight reduction and therapeutic interventions that sensitize insulin [189]. Hence, weight loss and improving IR are part of the therapeutic interventions for Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) treatment.",4d0716a7-9c5f-401c-9dfe-b035f6440d95
52,methods52,"  Generally, successful weight management in women with Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) face some obstacles as they are more prone to resistant weight gain than others, and their excess androgens enhance abdominal adiposity [189,190]. Women with excess androgens have also reported increased craving to carbohydrates (CHO), which increases their dietary intake [191]. Accordingly, several diets have been tested for their efficacy in weight reduction among those women, and some were found to be more ideal than others [192,193,194].  The KD has been shown to have positive effects on women with Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). A study has implemented a strict KD on women of reproductive age with Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), BMI >27 kg/m2, and no other severe medical disorders for the treatment of Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) [192].",b0255418-816c-4ae1-a9f7-6130da5dc2b2
53,methods53," Their fasting serum insulin and testosterone levels have significantly dropped after a six-month follow-up, as well as a remarkable weight reduction [192]. Another randomized study comparing the KD with a standard diet in women with Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has found that the KD improved IR, and reduced blood glucose, fasting insulin, and testosterone levels [194], positively impacting their medical condition. However, these findings were limited by their small sample sizes; therefore, they cannot be relied on for general applicability.  4.3.8. Alleviation of Inflammatory Pain  Physiologically, acute inflammation protects the body from various pathogens and enhances tissue repair [195]. While chronic inflammation serves no protective mechanisms and may elicit tissue damage that might be associated with pain [195].",3322ea8f-fdba-47f9-acb1-eec2141c6275
54,methods54," In this situation, the activation of various proinflammatory mediators causes the sensitization of neurons associated with peripheral pain [195], leading to the so-called “inflammatory pain”. According to the known interrelation between diet and inflammatory pain [196,197], recent studies have looked over the chances of KD as a therapeutic strategy for inflammatory pain [198]. When inflammation was induced in mice and rats’ models treated with a KD, tactile allodynia was vastly diminished [198]. This finding supported another study on allodynia associated with MetS, which improved with a KD and enhanced peripheral neural regeneration [199]. Neuropathic inflammatory pain can be central or peripheral, and both can benefit from the KD, yet the response may vary between conditions [198]. The use of the KD as a therapeutic strategy for the pain of various causes was successfully reported in several other conditions, such as migraines [200] and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [201].",0c802318-83fb-416a-916d-1277cb201b9c
55,methods55," However, the exact mechanism by which a KD improves pain is still indefinite. Finally, various clinical and pre-clinical studies have highlighted that a KD’s positive role extends beyond weight loss. The KD can offer more comprehensive therapeutic options, and more studies are encouraged to explore its concealed benefits.  4.4. Challenges “C”  The strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities of extreme carbohydrates (CHO) restrictions are now well-appreciated. However, and like several therapeutic approaches, the KD has faced many challenges, and the most important will be discussed in this section. The quality of diet could be primarily affected by a KD. Eliminating carbohydrates (CHO) is not confined to bread, rice, and pasta [24].",5567fcfd-335b-486e-9d1c-b709d9dba725
56,methods56," Essential fibers, iron, vitamins (A, B1, B6, B9, E and K), and minerals (potassium, magnesium and calcium) may all be insufficiently provided in the diet as carbohydrates (CHO)-containing fruits, vegetables and legumes should be taken into consideration [24,202,203]. Therefore, micronutrients inadequacy is widespread [204], and keeping up with long-term supplements to overcome some of these shortfalls is challenging.  Another significant factor affecting the obtainment of favorable results and proper assessment of the outcomes is the compliance to the KD, which can partly be secondary to the limited food choices that make the KD intolerable in the long run [110,205,206]. Other than food intake records, serum ßOHB and urine KB levels are common ways to monitor the response to the KD and assess diet adherence [207,208]. Serum ßOHB and urine KB levels may be inaccurate when the KD is not maintainable and are obtained at additional costs [110,206].",5783de57-1661-4b5e-92e9-f1896e74886d
57,methods57,"  Since some patients follow the KD as a therapeutic intervention for a particular disease, not just for weight loss, restricting certain foods that patients find delightful might be more stressful for both patients and their caregivers. Hence, adjusting the suitable KD option without interfering with diet compliance is challenging [163]. Furthermore, enjoying socializing with people while on a KD without messing up the planned diet is another dilemma [163].  It has been reported that in some hospitalized patients, or those receiving medications that induce hyperglycemia, hidden carbohydrates (CHO) might hamper the effect of nutritional ketosis [168]. For instance, drug-induced hyperglycemia may be caused by β-blockers, thiazide diuretics, glucocorticoids, and some antipsychotics [209,210]. Moreover, lorazepam, for example, generates daily carbohydrates (CHO) that contributes to the daily allowed carbohydrates (CHO) in a KD regimen [211].",1762d66f-a1ee-4cbe-b27c-5f495c2e6d1b
58,methods58," The carbohydrates (CHO) elevation in such cases might go unnoticed and might require dietary plans with lower carbohydrates (CHO) content. It is indeed challenging for a health care practitioner to be qualified enough to spot these cases and adjust their suitable diet accordingly. Detailed assessment before initiating a KD is mandatory [212] and should include the entire medical history, nutritional status, laboratory tests, and any contraindications to start the KD [212].  The suitability of the KD implementation varies between individuals. Detailed medical guidance is required for some patients, such as people with diabetes and those at high risk of developing complications, like hyperlipidemia, severe liver and renal diseases, and metabolic disturbances, to minimize unnecessary side effects and improve their outcomes [212,213].",37dbafb9-c9db-48e6-a183-8612ee4bef7c
59,methods59," Despite the detailed reporting of the contraindications of the KD in the literature [154], studies regarding these concerns among vulnerable individuals are lacking. Nowadays, the KD is commonly initiated by experienced nutritionists; however, ascertaining whether all of them possess the sufficient qualification to distinguish the suitable candidates for a KD from those at risk is a challenge on its own.  A few other challenges were reported by a study that evaluated the worldwide use of the KD. In countries with carbohydrates (CHO)s, especially rice, as a principal constituent of their diet, following a KD was complicated [214]. Sometimes, a clear nutritional information label is not provided on ready-made food items and ensuring their components might be difficult [214]. In addition, financial issues in some regions might stand in the way of following, and adhering to, a KD [214].",e4f7c6c5-b745-4c33-915a-c83ec4221ce8
60,methods60," A randomized cross-over study compared the adherence of individuals on the KD to Mediterranean diet during periods where the diet was readily provided and when self-prepared by participants and found a lower dietary adherence when participants were responsible for purchasing their own meals [215]. After all, the KD is a therapeutic intervention and can face various obstacles during its application. The ongoing research might be promising to overcome a few of the challenges mentioned above.  5. Discussion  The expanding global prevalence of various diseases warrants revealing the safety and efficacy of any therapeutic approach, including dietary interventions. The KD is becoming promoted nowadays as an effective and satisfying weight reduction method by the public. However, the initiation of unsupervised KD protocol is common and might result in more harm than benefit.",58b6bccb-a0a6-431e-b3cc-1c6e04053b74
61,methods61," Due to the insufficient comprehensive analysis of all aspects of the KD, we performed a strengths weaknesses opportunities and challenges (SWOC) analysis that aimed to clarify the potential advantages of KD, drawbacks, value in certain disorders, and its associated challenges, and how to deal with them. Figure 2 summarizes the strengths weaknesses opportunities and challenges (SWOC) analysis results.  The discussed mechanisms of action of the KD at the cellular, molecular, biochemical, and immunological levels opened the door to its employment in a protective and therapeutic modality. Inducing nutritional ketosis by a well-formulated KD can provide huge benefits for patients with obesity, IR, T2DM, and MetS, which not only improves glycemic control and overall health, but ultimately impacts cardiovascular health and helps in treating other endocrinological disorders such as Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).",e3dfc4d7-0f85-4426-9053-29fefaef9e43
62,methods62," However, the long-term safety of the KD on CV health cannot be ascertained, which should be kept in mind if the KD was carried out in those with high CV risk.  Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are two key elements in the development of various disorders [216]. Nutritional ketosis and KBs were proven to successfully combat mitochondrial dysfunction, reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, activate antioxidant pathways, and suppress inflammation. These mechanisms have given optimism for those with disorders of exaggerated inflammatory processes, such as neurodegeneration and cardiometabolic disorders [217], and in cases of mitochondrial malfunction. KD was also shown to be protective of the mitochondrial genome from oxidative damage [54]. Furthermore, the ability of KD to build an overall unfavorable metabolic environment for cancer cells was able to aid in shortcutting the tumors’ nourishment, as malignant cells fail to thrive on ketones [53].",38df6333-674d-42a8-be5f-7085e213a6dd
63,methods63," This has given faith in enhancing chemotherapeutic effects and positively influencing those with glioblastoma, gastric cancers, and other types of malignancies.  The significance of the KD in improving neurological disorders resides in its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and mitochondrial restoration properties. The established role of KD as a non-pharmacological agent for treating multiple forms of epilepsy [32,168] have given it various opportunities to be implemented in other neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s [218], Parkinson’s [113], and multiple sclerosis (MS).  The significant advantages offered by the KD poses the question: is the KD very innocent to provide weight loss values and options for treating various conditions without complications? The numerous KD-related drawbacks and challenges explained clarify that the KD is not for everyone and should be initiated with caution.",8adbe9e6-ebf7-4694-99d6-84d601df6b90
64,methods64," Short-term adverse effects such as keto flu, hair loss, palpitations, or leg cramps may be tolerable by most people [108]; however, long-term complications such as cardiomyopathy, renal stones, and prolonged nutritional deficiencies may have detrimental effects [111,112,113]. Furthermore, many ketosis-related complications might be associated with metabolic acidosis, which might be dangerous in some cases, such as pregnancy and breastfeeding [139]. Additionally, the blood pressure and blood glucose-lowering effects among hypertensives and diabetics might induce attacks of life-threatening hypotension or hypoglycemia if not properly monitored [110]. Moreover, a meta-analysis of observational studies that assessed the effects of a long-term KD has revealed its association with a higher risk of all-cause mortality [219].",116881ba-66a0-4195-8426-33eff183ccae
65,methods65," Aside from its drawbacks, the KD faces multiple challenges that may interfere with its outcomes, such as changing quality of life, maintaining sufficient nutrients, proper monitoring of ketosis, and ensuring full awareness of its adverse effects by health care providers [163,204,205,212].  In summary, the KD shows variable physiological and metabolic responses between individuals that are dependent on various factors, such as diet compliance, co-existing medical illnesses, financial issues, and the level of professionalism of health care practitioners initiating the KD. Whether KD benefits for an individual outweigh potential risks should be well-founded before deciding to follow a KD.  According to our knowledge, no comprehensive work was dedicated before to improving KD implementation under the umbrella of a strengths weaknesses opportunities and challenges (SWOC) analysis.",ad0f5064-49bd-449a-82a0-28379aa30da0
66,methods66," Our review was the first to provide an opportunity for healthcare practitioners and nutritionists to design a personalized approach before initiating a KD that is well-formulated to reveal the full opportunities of a KD to take advantage of, and to highlight possible future challenges that one can face when implementing a KD. Furthermore, it prevents disregarding the pitfalls of a KD that could be more harmful than beneficial and encourages healthcare providers to avoid being short-sighted when making healthcare-related decisions. Moreover, understanding the detailed strengths and weaknesses of all aspects of the KD ensures reserving these types of dietary regimens for those who would actually benefit from the opportunities it provides, with maximum safety measures.  6. Conclusions  The strengths weaknesses opportunities and challenges (SWOC) analysis highlighted the main strengths and weaknesses of KD.",bc36f2c3-e8d6-4d8d-85ba-fb809a84117c
67,methods67," It summarized all points of interest that help physicians decide the suitability of KD for specific individuals and its inappropriateness to others.
