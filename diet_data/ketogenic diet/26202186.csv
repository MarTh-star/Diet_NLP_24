0,background0,"Emerging evidence indicates that ketogenic diets can have therapeutic potential for a broad range of cancers in preclinical animal models and in patients [1–6]. A ketogenic diet is a high-fat low carbohydrate diet that was developed originally to treat refractory epilepsy [7]. KDs create a metabolic state similar to that seen in water-only fasting, where blood glucose levels are reduced and blood ketone bodies (D-β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) are elevated [7, 8]. Warburg first showed that aerobic fermentation (lactate production in the presence of oxygen) was a hallmark feature of many cancers [9]. This unusual metabolism of tumor cells later became known as the Warburg effect [10].  Aerobic fermentation was considered a compensatory response to an underlying deficiency in oxidative phosphorylation that could arise from any number of deficiencies in the structure, function or number of mitochondria [11].",f4466f80-45ef-4dcd-b2b2-d2ada2373fd9
1,background1," Consequently, many tumor cells become addicted to glucose for survival and growth [8, 12, 13]. KDs could therefore put tumor cells under metabolic stress in lowering the availability of glucose and in elevating blood ketone bodies that require functional mitochondria for metabolism [13, 14].  Most normal cells of the body readily metabolize ketone bodies for energy especially when glucose levels become reduced. Indeed, ketone bodies are considered a super fuel since they enhance the ΔG of Adenosine triphosphate ATP hydrolysis while reducing production of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) through the co-enzyme Q couple [15]. In contrast to normal cells, the glucose-dependent tumor cells cannot use ketone bodies effectively for energy [16]. Ketone bodies can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor cells, which can be lethal to these cells [2].",f3ba916b-ca04-4683-afea-53e92815b217
2,background2," Hence, diets that can target glucose availability while elevating circulating ketone bodies can be a non-toxic therapeutic strategy for managing those tumor cells that express the Warburg effect.  The present study was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a modified Atkins diet on subjects with advanced cancers. Our secondary objective was to determine whether the diet influenced tumor stability or progression based on changes in fluorodeoxyglucose FDG and PET/CT imaging.

He had difficulty maintaining ketosis but maintained his weight and active lifestyle while pain free until a few weeks before his death at age 88, marking 80 weeks from his date of enrollment.  Our second patient, (# 9), was a 62 year old male with stage IV melanoma who completed the trial at 16 weeks with stable disease. Intermittently he would be less strict with the diet and lapse out of ketosis.",54e7a6eb-b0ff-4ef0-8fba-5eaa0b7694de
29,results21," He had tried and progressed through ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, three rounds of transhepatic chemoembolization, two rounds of oral Temozolomide, and gamma knife radiation to his brain metastases. During the last year of his life he received no chemotherapy other than gamma knife brain irradiation plus a month of Temozolomide, and followed the ketogenic diet as his main treatment course. He was hospitalized for new onset seizures and subsequently placed on systemic steroids. Despite this he mostly remained on the ketogenic diet but because of the hyperglycemic effects of the steroids was unable to achieve the target glucose ketone index Glucose/Ketone Index (GKI). His performance status however remained excellent and he lived a total of 116 weeks from diet initiation, and nearly three years from his initial diagnosis of stage four melanoma.",b95dcaa4-fdc9-4682-8a9d-1aca4cfc076c
30,results22,"  Our third patient, a 42-year old male with stage IV BRAF V600 positive, Vemurafenib intolerant metastatic melanoma (patient 12), completed 16 weeks of the trial with stable disease but had persistently PET positive left axillary nodes which had not changed in size but did have some partial decrease in hypermetabolic activity while on the diet. He underwent complete surgical removal of his persistent bulky metastatic axillary nodes in July 2014 and had no adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation. He followed the modified ketogenic diet for another year after surgery and then reverted back to a standard diet at around 80 weeks. He had no evidence of disease on PET/CT scan and remained alive and well at 131 weeks.  The fourth patient, patient 17, an 84 year old with chemo-naive stage IV squamous cell lung carcinoma dieted until 16 weeks and finished the trial with stable disease while achieving excellent ketosis (+2).",8f4f129b-e1c9-4109-892f-2e5db385206e
31,results23," However, after completing the trial at week 16, he decided to revert back to low carbohydrate, non-ketotic diet. He failed to follow up for repeat imaging and died at 40 weeks. ",68d85d94-374f-4f40-b5cd-2ebdcbbbf3e1
32,discussion0,"This trial showed that a modified ketogenic diet was well tolerated in cancer patients with a broad variety of solid tumors. Adverse effects were minimal and none were serious. These findings are therefore consistent with other studies that treated brain cancer patients with ketogenic diets [4, 5, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18] Concerns about weight loss and malnutrition were one of the initial worries as was the possibility of deleterious effects on one’s lipid profile and quality of life. Most of our patients were either overweight (7 pts. or 42 % with body mass index (BMI) 25–29.9) or obese (7 or 42 % with body mass index (BMI) over 30) at enrolment and only 3 had normal (18 % with body mass index (BMI) 18.5–24.9) weight upon entering the trial. Surprisingly, weight loss did not show significant correlations with ketone levels, glucose or other hematologic or electrolyte measurements. Weight loss was seen in all patients and was significant (p = 0.0001).",2dba035d-c731-4ce6-a516-b733fc5e364c
33,discussion1, The patients who responded with either stable disease or partial responses had significantly more weight loss (p = 0.01) than those patients who progressed. Weight loss percentage of at least 10 % or more was seen in the responders. This weight loss was not like the cachectic weight loss that we see in cancer patients in their terminal stages because our patients maintained their quality of life scores and in some cases even improved upon them.  There was also some concern that the renal function might worsen with this diet and that diabetics might not be able to tolerate it. Renal function as well as hematologic parameters remained stable. One patient (patient 4) who began with some renal insufficiency improved his serum creatinine after 4 weeks while another patient with diabetes (patient 2) who was on insulin became insulin free within days.  Previous studies examined the effects of this diet on small patient numbers. These studies were also of short duration 4-12 weeks.,f52bc327-83a8-4db2-a735-378fe3b873d0
34,discussion2," We wanted to improve on this by allowing our patients to diet for a longer period of time (16 weeks). In addition we allowed long-term follow up after the 16-week period was completed. We followed four patients beyond 16 weeks and found that one (patient 17) reverted back to a standard diet within days while the other two (patients 4 and 12) continued to follow the diet without any subsequent chemotherapy or radiation, remaining in stable status for as long as 80 and 131 weeks.  Combining the diet with chemotherapy and/or radiation appears feasible. One patient (patient 9) subsequently tried a short course (one month) of oral chemotherapy and had also benefitted from invasive radiology as well as radio surgical interventions.  In the VM-M3 glioblastoma model, a low Glucose/Ketone Index (GKI) is related to decreased invasion, proliferation and angiogenesis [19].",28976c2d-10c5-47cd-87c1-e244909cfa20
35,discussion3," The study protocol was created prior to the introduction of the Glucose/Ketone Index (GKI) and our patients did not have the benefit of frequent home glucose and ketone monitoring hence the collected in-hospital glucose and ketone readings may not be truly reflective of their actual glucose ketone indices. Discrepancies in blood draw timing and patient compliance with timing of clinic visits may have also affected some of our glucose values. Glucose ketone indices (Glucose/Ketone Index (GKI)) were calculated and we found that although no patient met the targeted range of Glucose/Ketone Index (GKI), some still derived benefit, significantly outliving their estimated lifespans. One patient (patient #9) who had a good response and survived until 116 weeks, experienced persistent “ketone breath” despite achieving low βHOB ketone readings. It is possible that he achieved adequate therapeutic levels that somehow escaped detection [20, 21].",1fb09251-dd21-43a3-8151-85942fcc711e
36,discussion4,"  We wanted to attract a diverse population of patients, and standardize all evaluations. The small number of recruited patients limited our trial, and our recruitment was uniformly Caucasian male even though we did not exclude diverse racial types nor exclude females. Had we expanded our trial to another year’s length we perhaps could have attracted a more diverse patient sample.  One previous study had recruited patients from different institutions each with their own dietician, hence dietary instruction was not standardized across the board [4]. Blood work/scans were sent to separate laboratories and imaging facilities, possibly causing variations in data interpretations. We hoped to improve on this by recruiting all our subjects from a single institution and uniformly obtained all our testing from our inpatient hospital laboratory. Our images were read by a dedicated nuclear radiologist as well as obtained via the same dedicated PET/ CT scanner. Travel time was also an issue.",eb30a91d-8c91-45a2-ac6d-96c16543ec9d
37,discussion5," Most of our patients lived a long distance from our hospital (some > 3 h away) which made recruitment difficult given the travel time and frequency of visits. Majority of the interested patients who lived locally did not qualify, as they were not US veterans, one reason for inclusion.  We chose to scan with PET/CT imaging as early as 4 weeks. Previous studies show that PET/CT scans can detect partial responses to chemotherapy as early as after one cycle [2]. In the future we feel that an 8 week PET/CT scan instead of four will be more useful as some tumors may actually be experiencing a tumor flare prior to shrinkage. We also excluded patients with brain metastases because we expected poorer performance statuses. In hindsight it could have been better to include them. Many of these patients actually do well enough to last through a short dietary course without any deleterious effects.  Not all of our patients responded to the KD.",61d500a6-9507-48af-ba75-e81a1f44cb31
38,discussion6," Previous work on identifying characteristics that would predict for response have studied the role of defective OXPHOS enzymes [11, 22]. The metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to non-oxidative fermentation is thought to be related to upregulation of transketolase TKTL-1 protein expression which was correlated with invasive tumors [23, 24]. Identification of ketolytic and glycolytic enzyme overexpression in malignancies may help stratify those patients with low enzyme expression and accordingly should respond more favorably to the KD [11, 24].  Most of our patients were overweight and were likely to be leptin resistant and as a result have high body leptin levels. Leptin is a pro-angiogenic metabolic hormone which is secreted by adipose tissue. It sends satiety signals to the hypothalamus in response to caloric intake. Ghrelin is the opposing hormone which increases our appetite. Intake of sucrose during the fasting state results in a rise in serum leptin.",f499be6e-c2c8-4f05-aa10-aab4869d9a65
39,discussion7," However, over consumption of foods high in sucrose leads to a blunted leptin response, which leads to higher serum leptin levels [25, 26]. Unlike leptin, ghrelin secretion is suppressed by intake of both sucrose and fats. Leptin secretion is therefore probably linked to sucrose rather than fat metabolism. Increased leptin levels are associated with faster tumor growth in animal studies [27]. In humans, particularly obese individuals have higher leptin levels and correspondingly have higher rates of human cancers. A study of melanoma patients found significantly higher leptin levels in those with positive sentinel node biopsies [28]. The patients who responded with stable or improved disease lost more percentage weight, and by doing so decreased the body leptin and consequently slowed down angiogenesis.  The effect of the diet on lifespan cannot be adequately examined here due to the low number of subjects enrolled and the diverse nature of each patient’s individual tumors.",2e1529b7-f217-4643-b166-64704bc3c134
40,discussion8," However out of the four patients who did well until 16 weeks, three had a diagnosis of melanoma and all three not only went beyond 16 weeks of dieting but also significantly exceeded their expected lifespans (typically only 3 months). One remains alive and free of disease at 121 weeks. Due to variations in timing of blood draws, the reported ketone levels of these patients were not significantly elevated and none achieved the target glucose ketone index, although two did report significant halitosis which could mean that their recorded ketone levels may be underestimating their true average daily [20, 21] Whether patients with malignant melanomas have intrinsic characteristics making them more responsive to the ketogenic diet over other tumor types remains to be investigated further.  Conclusions The modified Atkins diet is well tolerated by patients with advanced cancer. Hematologic parameters, serum cholesterol, renal function and lipid levels remained stable.",1193699e-47ec-4452-84e0-2d5b7066ba15
41,discussion9," There was improvement in insulin requirements and renal function in a few patients. Quality of life measures remained stable and the diet was simple to initiate and implement. For some, the adherence to the diet remained excellent at one year and beyond. It is possible that therapeutic efficacy could be greater in future studies where patients can enter the predicted Glucose/Ketone Index (GKI) zone. In this study, ideal target glucose and ketone values may have been reached but were not accurately recorded due to variations in patient compliance with blood draw timing and fasting states. The diet might help improve quality and of life and enhance tumor response to chemotherapy in cancer patients. Looking forward, the incorporation of immunohistochemical staining for ketolytic/glycolytic enzymes and biomarkers (i.e. leptin, insulin) and their role in tailoring metabolic cancer management merits further study.",dd5cf484-5b1b-4779-97c1-d50ae49f5cfa
42,discussion10," Notably, melanoma patients represented the three who benefitted most from this study. Future studies should investigate the modified Atkins diet MAD or the ketogenic diet KD and their potential benefits to this type of cancer.
