0,introduction0,"While intensive insulin therapy and other interventions slow the development of diabetic complications [1], there is far less evidence that these interventions reverse diabetic complications. For example, tight glucose control prevented the development of nephropathy (as indicated by proteinuria) in a rat model of Type 1 diabetes, but did not reverse nephropathy once proteinuria had developed [2]. Thus there is a general consensus that diabetes is associated with progressive and cumulative processes that are much more amenable to retardation than to reversal. Nevertheless, from a clinical perspective, reversing pathologies associated with diabetes would be far more valuable than simply delaying their onset.  We have proposed that both diabetic complications and age-related pathologies develop due to a progressive and cumulative effect of glucose metabolism that produces a bistable hysteretic effect on gene expression [3].",0e36b526-73d0-4748-9e61-455c709caf16
1,introduction1," In addition to glycolytic enzymes that would be expected to produce oxidative stress [3], glucose metabolism also induces a variety of molecular responses such as thioredoxin-interaction protein [4] and p65 [5] that could plausibly contribute to nephropathy. Indeed, the latter induction is persistent, even after normalization of glucose, thus exemplifying glucose-induced hysteresis and its clinical correlate, metabolic memory, including in nephropathy [6]. Furthermore, based particularly on detailed analysis of the hysteretic behavior of the lac operon [7], [8], we have hypothesized that sufficiently prolonged and robust reduction in glucose metabolism or molecular responses to glucose metabolism may reverse this bistable molecular state, leading to reversal of pathology [3]. While examining basic mechanisms mediating molecular responses to glucose, we observed that the ketone 3-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (3-OHB) blocked the inhibition of agouti-related peptide by glucose [9].",99bd764b-1df5-4cc1-a893-9db0a5cdd5d0
2,introduction2," Together with evidence suggesting that the ketogenic diet produces a prolonged exposure to 3-OHB, these data suggest that the ketogenic diet may prevent and even reverse pathologies associated with diabetes. One manipulation that produces a chronic elevation in 3-OHB levels is caloric restriction, and we have hypothesized that this elevation in 3-OHB may mediate many of the protective effects of dietary restriction [3]. On the other hand, chronic caloric restriction is not a plausible intervention for clinical use. An alternative approach to producing chronic elevation of 3-OHB is a ketogenic diet, used clinically to treat refractory epilepsy [10]. Although the mechanism by which the ketogenic diet reduces the frequency of epileptic seizures is not entirely understood, most evidence suggests that it does so by reducing neuronal glucose metabolism [11], [12].",721eb619-9465-4870-aad6-3503fdd57f7e
3,introduction3," Furthermore, analysis of the effect of the ketogenic diet on gene expression is consistent with the hypothesis that the ketogenic diet does re-route cellular metabolism away from glucose utilization and toward the use of alternative fuels, presumably including 3-OHB [13], [14]. In the present studies we therefore examined if a ketogenic diet would reverse pathologies produced by diabetes. We focused on nephropathy because kidney function is relatively amenable to repetitive assessment simply by repetitive collection of urine, thus allowing definitive determination that pathology had developed before beginning the dietary intervention. These studies clearly demonstrate that diet can reverse diabetic kidney disease even after it has developed. ",448cf089-6d51-4359-b5dc-068a1ebd6b56

The ketone 3-OHB is cytoprotective To further assess potential mechanisms mediating the protective effects of the ketogenic diet, and since glucose toxicity in diabetes is thought to be mediated by glucose-induced oxidative stress, we assessed if the ketone 3-OHB would protect cells from oxidative stress enhanced by either high or low glucose.

6,results0,"Reduction of blood glucose and increase in blood 3-OHB by ketogenic diet As expected, the ketogenic diet produced elevated blood 3-OHB in all groups, particularly in the diabetic mice (Table 1). Furthermore, after 2 months on the ketogenic diet blood glucose was reduced in wild-type mice, completely normalized in Akita (Type 1) and partly normalized in db/db (Type 2) diabetic mice. The ketogenic diet also reduced body weight in wild-type mice but not in diabetic mice, even though the diet reduced caloric intake in db/db mice. None of the conditions influenced blood pH, although there was a non-significant trend toward reduced blood pH (i.e., acidification) in diabetic mice, and the ketogenic diet reversed this trend.  10.1371/journal.pone.0018604.t001Table 1 Physiological characteristics.

Reversal of albuminuria in diabetic mice As anticipated [23] Akita mice developed hyperglycemia around 4 weeks of age and by 20 weeks of age Akita mice had all developed nephropathy on the control diet, as indicated by a roughly 10-fold increase in urinary albumin/creatinine ratios (Figure 1A). At that point half of the diabetic Akita mice and half of the euglycemic mice were placed on the ketogenic diet, whereas half of the diabetic and half of the euglycemic mice were continued on the control (normal high-carbohydrate) diet.",74215073-53d7-45c9-a294-023835ce69b2
8,results2," Within one week after switching to the ketogenic diet, blood glucose in Akita mice was completely normalized (127+/−17 mg/dl), without insulin treatment; blood glucose fell slightly in the euglycemic mice (83+/−8 mg/dl) on the ketogenic diet. Within 2 weeks, 4 of the Akita mice on the control diet had died, reducing the n to 8, whereas none of the mice on the ketogenic diet had died. Since it was clear that all the control Akita mice would be dead within 2 months (consistent with other survival curves of mice with Type 1 diabetes [24]), when we anticipated the Akita mice would be sacrificed, thus preventing post-sacrifice comparison of kidney oxidative stress and histology, we elected to sacrifice all mice on the control diet (wild-type and Akita), and to continue to monitor blood glucose and urinary albumin/creatinine ratios in mice on the ketogenic diet.",630f65f7-224f-41c8-96b6-6265d8ed3b86
9,results3," Remarkably, within 2 months, diabetic nephropathy was completely reversed as indicated by urinary albumin/creatinine ratios (Figure 1A). Figure 1A shows just the data from the group of Akita mice that was placed on the ketogenic diet, for clarity. “Akita-Chow” actually refers to the group of Akita mice that were on chow up until 20 weeks, then switched to the ketogenic diet. “Akita-Keto” refers to the same mice at 28 weeks, after having been on the ketogenic diet for 8 weeks. The ketogenic diet had no effect on albumin/creatinine ratios in euglycemic control mice. The key observation is that after 8 weeks on the ketogenic diet, the formerly “Akita/Chow” mice exhibited complete reversal of diabetic nephropathy, as demonstrated by albumin/creatinine ratios. Similarly, db/db mice developed hyperglycemia by 12 weeks of age, at which time half of the mice were switched to the ketogenic diet.",5e49da14-b69e-4144-8231-91eb6a3f6940

11,results5,"  Reversal of stress- and toxicity-related gene expression induced with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in kidney In view of the functional reversal of diabetic nephropathy by the ketogenic diet, we examined if the functional reversal was accompanied by reversal of molecular evidence of diabetes-induced toxicity. To carry out this assessment we examined expression of genes implicated in response to cellular stress, particularly oxidative stress, using quantitative PCR arrays (SABiosciences). This analysis led us to discover 9 genes whose expression in kidney is induced both in Type 1 and in Type 2 diabetes (Figure 2; Table 2). In general the induction of these genes was more robust in Akita than in db/db mice. Of particular interest, the elevated expression of every gene was completely reversed by the ketogenic diet in Akita mice and largely or completely reversed in db/db mice, which is remarkably consistent with effects on albuminuria.",06d5286b-341a-4517-8a7e-2bbc0f344650
12,results6," One gene, Fmo1, was inhibited in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes (Figure 2J), and this inhibition was completely reversed in both conditions by the ketogenic diet. IL-18 (Figure 2K) exhibited yet a different pattern, in that its expression was not influenced by diabetes but was inhibited by the ketogenic diet, which could thereby produce some protective effect directly.  10.1371/journal.pone.0018604.g002Figure 2 Diabetic nephropathy is associated with a similar profile of gene expression for oxidative stress and toxicity related transcripts in models of Type 1 (Akita) and Type 2 (db/db) diabetes – reversal with ketogenic diet.

15,results9," Conversely, the induction of three genes, Nox1, Nox4, and Txnip, by diabetes plausibly contributes to pathology by producing oxidative stress [4], [23], and the complete reversal of the elevation of these genes by the ketogenic diet plausibly contributes to the reversal of neuropathy. In contrast, the elevation of Hmox1, Hmox2, and Gpx2 by diabetes probably reflects, rather than causes, oxidative stress, and the reversal of the elevation of these genes probably reflects reversal of the oxidative stress (as was probably the case in most of the genes shown in Figure 2). Although the graphs in Figure 3A were those for whose effects of diabetes were significant, the consistent pattern for other stress-related genes to be elevated by diabetes and reversed by the ketogenic diet was quite striking for both genes associated with oxidative stress (Figure 3B) and genes associated with other forms of cellular stress (Figure 3C).  10.1371/journal.pone.0018604.",d6a32d4f-3c39-4713-b12d-f917aecf8374

17,discussion0,"In contrast to previous studies in which good glucose control prevented, but did not reverse, nephropathy in a model of Type 1 diabetes [2], in the present studies the ketogenic diet reversed nephropathy, as reflected by albumin/creatinine ratios, after it had developed in models of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The reversal of functional nephropathy was associated with robust normalization of expression of genes induced by oxidative and other forms of stress. In contrast to the complete reversal of nephropathy as reflected by albuminuria and gene expression, histological evidence of nephropathy was only partially reversed in the model for Type 2 diabetes (kidneys from the Akita mice were not available for histological analysis). This suggests, perhaps not surprisingly, that functional and molecular aspects of nephropathy reverse more quickly than morphological aspects of diabetic nephropathy.",1c0d1f71-6ba5-49f3-9eea-9b3159df1c1e
18,discussion1,"  The present study also confirmed and greatly extended the number of molecular markers for diabetic nephropathy, especially for genes whose expression in kidney is induced in models of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The gene most robustly induced in both forms of diabetes was Cdkn1a, also known as p21 (Figure 2A). Cdkn1a was induced over 20-fold in Akita mice though only about 4-fold in db/db mice, consistent with the generally more robust effect of diabetes on gene expression in Akita mice compared to db/db mice, though interestingly albuminuria was greater in db/db mice than in Akita mice. Although induction of p21 has been reported in a rat model of Type 1 diabetic nephropathy [26], the functional significance of this observation is unclear.",88bf9423-5896-447d-a129-5b6ec6bc785f
19,discussion2," P21 is induced by a number of cellular stressors and generally appears to play a role in ameliorating stresses, including DNA damage [27], so it seems likely that in the present studies the induction of p21 and its reversal by the ketogenic diet reflects pathological processes rather than mediating the reparative effects of the ketogenic diet. Indeed, this appears to be the case for the vast majority of the genes whose expression was induced in both forms of diabetic nephropathy and whose induction was reversed by the ketogenic diet. Possible exceptions to this pattern are Nox1, Nox4, Txnip, and Duox1, whose induction all plausibly contribute to the development of oxidative stress [4], [23], and thus whose inhibition by the ketogenic diet all plausibly contribute to the restorative effects of the ketogenic diet.",c0ee625d-3e6b-4aa1-a21e-c44c7ce0cd16
20,discussion3," Similarly, Casp-8 was inhibited by the ketogenic diet in diabetic mice, and it has been reported that in db/db mice decreased caspase-8 activity correlates with decreased progression of diabetic nephropathy with moderate exercise [28], and podocyte apoptosis appears to be a feature of advanced diabetic nephropathy [26]. More directly reflective of nephropathy are the inhibition of nephrin, podocin, and ZO-1, all of which contribute to normal kidney function and restoration of which by the ketogenic diet plausibly reflects restoration of normal kidney function.  We also note that in contrast to the robust weight loss that the ketogenic diet produces in diet-induced obesity [13], the ketogenic diet increased, rather than decreased, body weight in db/db mice (Table 1). Furthermore, weight gain occurred even though caloric intake decreased.",6a24cacd-b75b-4712-9ce7-f34bfb559907
21,discussion4," It has similarly been reported that the ketogenic diet does not reduce body weight in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice [29], which we have also observed (Mastaitis, unpublished). Thus the weight gain observed in db/db mice, in contrast to the weight loss in wild-type mice, is presumably due to the fact leptin signaling is required for the reduction in body weight by the ketogenic diet, and the weight gain despite reduced caloric intake presumably reflects reduced metabolic rate. It will be of interest to determine which cell types mediate this requirement for leptin in weight loss by the ketogenic diet.  A key issue raised but not resolved in the present study is the mechanism by which the ketogenic diet reverses nephropathy and gene expression profiles associated with nephropathy. One potential mechanism is that the reversal was simply due to reduction in blood glucose.",7f9abbac-8c95-438d-9942-2822bea8119a
22,discussion5," However, since previous studies demonstrated that good glucose control prevented, but did not reverse, diabetic nephropathy [2], and since diabetic complications are thought to be caused by increased cellular metabolism of glucose [30], we hypothesize that at least part of the restorative effect was mediated by reduction of glucose metabolism. This hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence. First, the ketogenic diet appears to reduce the frequency of epileptic seizures by reducing glucose metabolism [11], [12]. Second, molecular responses to the ketogenic diet indicates a re-routing of cellular metabolism away from glucose utilization and toward the use of alternative fuels [13], [14]. Finally, we have shown that ketone 3-OHB blocks molecular effects of glucose [9]. We therefore hypothesize that the ketogenic diet reverses diabetic nephropathy by raising blood levels of 3-OHB which subsequently reduce glucose metabolism in at least some tissues including kidney.",0fb33fdb-86ed-4482-9b46-7e4b907c8c61
23,discussion6," Since ketones and the ketogenic diet are neuroprotective in a wide range of conditions [31], a phenomenon we have corroborated in the present study (Figure 6), it seems highly likely that the ketogenic diet will be protective in diabetic neuropathy and possibly retinopathy as well.  Although the present studies represent a proof of principle that pathologies produced by diabetes can be reversed by a simple dietary manipulation, many issues remain to be resolved before clinical application can be considered. First, the ketogenic diet is probably too extreme for chronic use in adult patients, and indeed may produce untoward iatrogenic effects. On the other hand, based on hysteretic mechanisms observed with the lac operon [7], [8], it is plausible that only transient exposure to the diet will effectively reverse the gene expression profile and thus in effect “reset” the pathological process.",fd40ffef-03c0-4e72-b723-acdca2fa62a1
24,discussion7," If so it is plausible that only a sustainable transient exposure to the diet may be needed to produce persistent reversal of pathologies associated with diabetes. Furthermore, if the mechanism by which the diet produces its protective effects is in fact the elevation of blood 3-bOHB, it is possible that a pharmacological intervention that mimics these effects might be sufficient to reverse pathology. Although we have not yet been successful in chronically elevating plasma 3-bOHB by chronic mini-pump infusion, dietary supplementation remains a possibility, including supplementation with ketogenic derivatives [32].",cbdb5541-4937-4a46-9beb-881f463b0e5b
25,discussion8," We have also demonstrated that chronic administration of the structurally similar molecular butyrate (differing only by a single oxygen atom) mimics many of the protective effects of dietary restriction through a mechanism dependent on the transcription factor CBP [33], so assessing the efficacy of this or related molecules in reversing pathologies due to diabetes would also be of great interest.
