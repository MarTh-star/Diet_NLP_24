0,introduction0," The initial tissue damage that occurs after spinal cord injury (spinal cord injury (SCI)) is followed by the activation of secondary injury mechanisms, which ultimately worsen the long-term outcomes. Ischemia, excitotoxicity, inflammation and energy failure are amongst these secondary mechanisms and lead to demyelination, neuronal death, and scar formation1–3. Indeed, this energy failure is partially caused by impaired mitochondrial function and an increase in oxidative stress due to overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)4,5. This increase in ROS production partly accounts for the damage caused to proteins forming the mitochondrial electron transport system (electron transport system (ETS)), cell membranes and mitochondrial DNA6–8. Interestingly, an imbalance of pro- versus anti-oxidative responses to oxidative stress can reciprocally aggravate ROS production thereby increasing mitochondrial damage in a potentially vicious cycle9.",629e3780-0295-45e0-af76-56ce620f58de
1,introduction1," In that regard, the acute temporal changes that affect mitochondrial bioenergetics and mitochondrial ROS production after spinal cord injury (SCI) have been previously characterized10–12.  The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low carbohydrate diet. The fats from the diet are converted by hepatic β-oxidation into ketone bodies which are used as alternative energy sources in the mitochondrial citric acid cycle3,13,14. Alternatively, the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) can also act as a signaling molecule by binding to at least two cell surface receptors: HCA2 (hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor) and FFAR3 (free fatty acid receptor 3)15–17. While changes in signaling pathways have been identified for the niacin-mediated activation of HCA215,18–20 fewer studies have looked at the effects of βHB or KD-mediated activation of HCA221–24. Whether those pathways could trigger beneficial changes in the spinal cord bioenergetics after trauma is yet unknown.",b331256f-de1a-4ec8-b4cf-04147ec21f9c
2,introduction2,"  Ketone bodies improve mitochondrial function in Parkinson’s, Alzheimer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy and neurotrauma17,25–32. In fact, a growing number of publications support the idea that a shift in energy metabolism towards ketogenesis and fatty acid oxidation may play a key role in controlling mitochondrial function and mitohormesis3. For example, acutely after traumatic brain injury (traumatic brain injury (TBI)) in rats, ketones increased the expression of antioxidant enzymes preventing oxidative stress-mediated mitochondrial damage and improving mitochondrial function33. Furthermore, in vitro work using cortical and hippocampal neurons suggests that ketones reduce ROS production by increasing NADH oxidation34 through activation of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs)31; and the administration of βHB rescues H2O2-mediated deficits in coupled mitochondrial respiration in rat hippocampal neurons both in vitro and in vivo28.",23d5e898-2215-4984-a80b-8c4b77a52ea8
3,introduction3," In the field of spinal cord injury (SCI), we have previously shown that KD improves forelimb motor function and promotes neuroprotection in rodents after spinal cord injury (SCI)35; and, for example, in traumatic brain injury (TBI) neuroprotection has been also attributed to ketones after fasting36. Others have shown that treatment with KD 2 weeks before cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) attenuates oxidative stress by inhibition of class I HDACs37. Similarly, the intra-spinal treatment with D-β-hydroxybutyrate for 2 weeks reduced inflammation and O2 − and H2O2 formation, increased ATP formation, and improved locomotor function in mice38. Despite the rapidly growing research on the use of KD or ketone bodies after spinal cord injury (SCI), the mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects are not well understood.",32f5366b-9941-4bcb-af77-7f3e12909956
4,introduction4,  The overall goal of the study was to elucidate the possible mechanisms by which a ketogenic state may be beneficial to counteract the mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction that occurs after spinal cord injury (SCI). We report that administration of KD initiated after spinal cord injury (SCI) restores mitochondrial bioenergetics. Overall our data show that KD modulation of select kinases and transcription factors involved in the control of the cellular and mitochondrial transcriptional and translational machineries together with the activation of anti-oxidant defence mechanisms globally contribute to the rescue of mitochondrial bioenergetics after cervical spinal cord injury. ,96618ab4-1d66-4480-a956-75f02e3e6dc9
5,methods0," Experimental design and spinal cord injury (SCI)  All procedures involving animals were conducted according to the guidelines of the Canadian Council for Animal Care and were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee.

21,results0," Ketogenic diet induces ketosis in rats 7 days after spinal cord injury (SCI)  We first examined the effectiveness of the Bioserv F5848 ketogenic diet (KD) in inducing ketosis in rats. This KD formulation (Fig. 1a) led to a significant increase in blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels one week post spinal cord injury (SCI) while at the same time glucose levels were significantly reduced (Fig. 1c). As expected, a significant weight loss occurred during the first days post-injury (days post injury (DPI)). However, the animals’ weights stabilized and recovered starting at 5 and 6 days post injury (DPI). Interestingly, the animals that were fed with KD showed a trend towards a better weight recovery 4 and 5 days post injury (DPI) when compared to the animals fed with the control diet (CD).

Ketogenic diet rescues complex I and II-driven respiration, improves complex IV activity and increases complex I, II and III protein expression following spinal cord injury (SCI)  To evaluate the possible benefits of KD on energy metabolism following spinal cord injury (SCI) we studied mitochondrial respiratory function and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the injured cervical spinal cord segments (Fig. 2a). For this, we used a substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor-titration protocol (see “Methods”) based on a previous report by Sullivan et al.10.

LEAK respiration measured after oligomycin addition to block ATP-synthase activity was significantly decreased after injury in both treated groups, CD and KD. The decrease in LEAK after injury was not prevented with the KD treatment (Fig. 2b). The ADP-stimulated OXPHOS for complex I showed greater variability and the apparent differences observed between the uninjured group and the injured groups (CD nor KD) did not reach significance. However, in the KD group, mitochondrial respiration with convergent electron supply through Complex I and Complex II were significantly higher compared to the CD group (48.12% increase, p = 0.028 for CI; 76.07% increase, p = 0.025 for Complex II (CII)).",99712447-1b55-4c39-bca3-d877035bfdcf

Although respiratory rates and control ratios were somewhat low in the permeabilized spinal cord tissue compared to other tissues, previous literature reveals variability in the rates between different models, tissues and cell types.

Similar results were observed when cytochrome c oxidase activity was measured in isolated mitochondria (See “Methods” section) from the epicenter of the injury (Supplementary Fig. S4).  Additionally, in order to identify changes in protein expression levels of the electron transport system (ETS) complexes after injury and dietary treatment, a western blot analysis using a “total OXPHOS” antibody cocktail was performed in tissue homogenates obtained from the epicenter of the injury (Fig. 2d,e).

Furthermore PGC-1α mRNA levels showed a trend towards an increase in the KD animals compared to the CD treated animals at 7days post injury (DPI) (p = 0.101). This trend that was no longer seen at 2-weeks post-injury, suggesting that the possible effect of KD may be transient or time-dependent (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, our 2 weeks post-injury data also show a significant upregulation in both injured groups (Fig. 3c).

Interestingly, ERK1/2 can regulate mitochondrial function77–79. In HeLa cell cultures, activation of ERK1/2 leads to its interaction with VDAC1 in the mitochondrial outer membrane promoting its translocation into the mitochondrial matrix. Once inside the mitochondrial matrix activated ERK1/2 interacts with the mitochondrial specific transcription factor transcription factor A (TFAM) in order to promote the transcription of the electron transport system (ETS) complexes40. Our results show that KD treatment induces an increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in spinal cord tissue homogenates, and transcription factor A (TFAM) expression in tissue homogenates and isolated mitochondria.",a418a77e-89a7-4fbb-b487-90fc610e9b95

However, this mechanism was not fully supported in this study as we were unable to detect ERK1/2 in the mitochondrial fraction. Since transcription factor A (TFAM) is a nuclear encoded gene80, one possibility is that an increased availability of transcription factor A (TFAM) would also increase its translocation into the mitochondria. Hence, an increase in ERK1/2 activation (and translocation) together with an increase in mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) could enhance the transcription of some of the electron transport system (ETS) complexes in order to compensate for the deficits observed after injury.  Similarly to ERK1/2, several studies have shown that STAT3 can also be found inside the mitochondria (mitoSTAT3) where it regulates the activity of the electron transport system (ETS)81–86.",ef7c40e3-0070-4c01-a407-eb690d120215

Interestingly, some findings suggest that STAT3 can directly interact with complexes I and II to regulate their activity84. Our results indicate that KD treatment increases total STAT3 content—but not the relative phosphorylation levels at Ser727- in tissue homogenates.

KD was found to inhibit the mTOR pathway in liver and brain42. mTORC1 regulates intracellular signaling associated with protein synthesis and acts as a nutrient/energy sensitive regulator through, for example, activation of p70-S6K, a serine/threonine kinase that via S6 ribosomal phosphorylation leads to protein synthesis; and inhibition of 4E-BP11, a member of the family of translation repressors91,92.

KD increased the phosphorylation of p70-S6K after injury but did not affect 4E-BP11 phosphorylation levels.

It is increasingly recognized that proteins and kinases can be translocated to or associating with mitochondria, modulating their differential expression in the mitochondrial pools versus the cytosolic pools (i.e. faster degradation, different activation mechanisms, and different activity levels)102.

Similarly to a recently published work from Lu et al.106, our data indicate that KD treatment decreases lipid peroxidation (4-HNE) and protein nitration (3NT) at the center of the lesion -where most of the infiltrated inflammatory cells are localized, and activates the NRF2-dependent antioxidant pathway after spinal cord injury (SCI) in vivo and in vitro. In response to stimuli, NRF2 detaches from KEAP1 in the cytosol and translocates into the nucleus to bind to the antioxidant response element (antioxidant response element (ARE)) leading to the expression of antioxidant-associated genes107.",fd774804-736e-4799-a8c4-63d65ad4df82
66,discussion14," Furthermore, NRF2 increases the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels, the rate of respiration and the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation108,109. Indeed, NRF2 plays a key role in regulating the balance between mitochondrial function and the redox state of the cells by modulating the utilization of substrates for mitochondrial respiration (NADH and FADH2), which also appears to be important for the function of antioxidant enzymes110. Our data from isolated mitochondria show that KD treatment also induces NRF2 activation. NRF2 can associate with the mitochondria through a complex with KEAP1 and the mitochondrial outer membrane serine/threonine kinase PGAM5. Interestingly, PGAM5 interacts with the antiapoptotic protein BCL-XL111 suggesting that KD, through an increase in NRF2 might also be important in reducing apoptosis after spinal cord injury (SCI). In addition, ROS production changes the activity of TCA cycle enzymes involved in the regulation of cellular metabolism.",d958dbfa-cdb7-4670-a128-bcf9cbdd0e0e
67,discussion15," In skeletal muscle aconitase (AC) undergoes oxidative modification and inactivation after oxidative stress54,112. Interestingly the opposite has been reported in the CNS where AC activity is increased at 7 and 28 days after optic nerve transection in rats113. Similarly, our results show increased AC activity after spinal cord injury (SCI) at 7 days post injury (DPI) which was reduced by KD treatment. Hence, after spinal cord injury (SCI) KD treatment could decrease AC activity, increase citrate production and thus protect the mitochondria from more oxidative damage leading to recovery of mitochondrial metabolism. These experimental differences also suggest that TCA enzyme function may differ between tissues or after different types of insults.",99d75d3b-3629-4ee1-a461-1081c63dfed4
68,discussion16,"  Finally, our microarray data are in line with previous work from the brain114, and as briefly commented at the beginning of the discussion, supports the hypothesis that KD treatment after injury might overall regulate the transcriptional and translational machineries (i.e. Eif4e, Mrps14, Nfyb) that control the expression of proteins encoding subunits of some of the complexes (i,e Ndufa12), or proteins required for their assembly (i.e. Cox11); which would contribute to the bioenergetic rescue after spinal cord injury (SCI). Additionally, our microarray data also indicate that KD might promote activation of antioxidative stress pathways complementary to the NRF2 pathway, seen by the up- and down-regulation of Gsta5 and Nrf1 respectively; and it implies that KD treatment triggers changes in expression of genes encoding proteins with roles in the glucose-fatty acid metabolism as previously reported114,115.  In conclusion, our findings—see Fig.",8537beb8-4e0c-4178-a6b3-2d649d281e3f
69,discussion17," 6 for graphical summary- indicate that KD mitigates mitochondrial oxidative damage and dysfunction in acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Furthermore, we provide new insights into the possible underlying regulatory mechanisms through which KD ameliorates mitochondrial bioenergetics after spinal cord injury (Fig. 6). Additional studies are necessary in order to evaluate whether these early metabolic changes are long lasting or if a long term exposure to ketone bodies, either via KD or ketone esters, might be necessary to sustain these early beneficial effects in cell metabolism seen after spinal cord injury (SCI).Figure 6 Graphical summary of the proposed mechanism of mitochondrial bioenergetics rescue and activation of antioxidant pathways by ketogenic diet after spinal cord injury (SCI).",d2860631-78f7-48cc-bbb7-72c520aeb42a
70,discussion18," After spinal cord injury (SCI), an increase in ROS production would affect several complexes of the Electron Transport System (electron transport system (ETS)) leading to a global dysfunction in cellular bioenergetics. Treatment with KD would lead to an increase in ketone bodies that would bind to specific receptors (i.e. HCA2, FFR2 or unknown). The activation of these receptors would trigger phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the increase in expression of Stat3 and mTOR . mTOR would regulate ribosomal translation and the subsequent synthesis of proteins and growth factors that are nutrient-dependent.",61338ce4-3e34-4cf0-be44-297a71f26a69
71,discussion19," Simultaneously, an increase in VDAC1 expression, might contribute to the translocation of phospho-ERK1/2 (and other essential proteins) into the mitochondrial matrix where by binding the mitochondrial transcription factor (transcription factor A (TFAM)) would lead to an increase mtDNA transcription and a subsequent expression of several components of the electron transport system (ETS) contributing to the mitochondrial bioenergetics rescue. Furthermore, the presence of the mitochondrial pools of Stat3 and mTOR/p70-S6K would contribute to the activation of some of the complexes of the electron transport system (ETS) and to reduce ROS production inside the mitochondria. KD treatment would also increase activation of the NRF2-dependent antioxidant pathway that not only would activate expression of antioxidant and DNA repair genes, but whose mitochondrial-associated pool might also help reducing cellular apoptosis.",e9c03cb2-25c5-491b-b6f6-b9eb4e14f3cf
72,discussion20," Moreover, KBs might act as an alternative substrate and promote neuroprotection. Overall, our data indicates that KD treatment regulates mtDNA transcription, DNA transcription and ribosomal translation, which altogether contributes to the improvement of mitochondrial bioenergetics after spinal cord injury (SCI).
