Study Population  Three hundred and seventy-four (374) males and females subjects with overweight or obesity were consecutively enrolled in the Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases unit of the University Hospital Campus Bio-Medico of Rome from December 2021 to May 2022 according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were adults aged 18–70 years and Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria comprised subjects with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), T2DM, pregnancy and breastfeeding, kidney failure and severe chronic kidney disease, liver failure, hearth failure (NYHA III–IV), respiratory insufficiency, unstable angina, a recent stroke or myocardial infarction (<12 months), cardiac arrhythmias, eating disorders and other severe mental illnesses, alcohol and substance abuse, active/severe infections, and frail older adults.",ed39963f-bea9-40c7-94d1-97c53cc1d415

The MD group comprised 191 subjects (54 males, 137 females), while the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)) group comprised 183 subjects (46 males, 137 females). The two groups were homogeneous for age, height, and weight.  To evaluate the effects of these two different nutritional protocols, the population was stratified according to gender (male and female), age (≤50 years old or ≥50 years old), and Body Mass Index (BMI) (in subjects with overweight Body Mass Index (BMI) comprised between 25–29.9 kg/m2; in subjects with obesity, Body Mass Index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2).  2.2.",d3c6bffd-dd89-4db3-9dee-8c54d0d42472
2,methods2," Study Protocol  At baseline (T0), the subjects underwent an endocrinological visit to evaluate if they could be included in the study according to the exclusion and inclusion criteria. When enrolled, they were consecutively allocated to either the MD or Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)). Participants received nutritional counseling and were given the dietetic protocol to be followed for three months. Follow-up visits were set up once monthly until 5% body weight loss was achieved.  Every fortnight, a phone call was conducted by nutritionists to check the dietary adherence and patients’ motivation through a 24 h dietary recall (Figure 1). When patients reached the goal of losing at least 5% of their initial body weight, they were invited to stop following the nutritional protocol and to start a maintenance diet (for the MD group) or a reintroduction diet (for the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)) group).  2.3.",aeffa44c-d4cb-4410-ac51-c999034ad337

Measurements were taken in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 12 h. Subjects wore underwear and were without shoes. Height was measured only at T0, while body weight was recorded every month until participants lost at least 5% of their initial body weight for a maximum of three months for both diets.  Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2) [5] and waist circumference (WC) was measured in the medium point between the last rib and the iliac crest [38].  2.4.

The diet included five meals daily (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two snacks) both for men and women. Participants were asked to prefer vegetables, wholegrain cereals, fish and legumes, lean white meat, and seeds, and to reduce red meat, eggs, and dairy products to only once a week. They were invited to consume fruit or low-fat yogurt as snacks and extra virgin olive oil as a seasoning in the amount of 30 mL (for women)–40 mL (for men) daily.

No significant differences were seen comparing the results between the two over 50 groups. We did not observe any changes in the body cellular mass percentage in both groups under and over 50 years old, so we can assume that these two diets preserve the body cellular mass at every age.  The results of both diets on anthropometrical and body composition parameters in subjects under and over 50 years old are reported in Table 2.  3.3.2. Body Mass Index (BMI)  Finally, we divided the population according to Body Mass Index (BMI): subjects with overweight (Body Mass Index (BMI) comprised between 25.0–29.9 kg/m2) and with obesity (Body Mass Index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2).",917a5a85-c8b9-4613-8d47-d74f413955db

The results of both diets on anthropometrical and body composition parameters in subjects with overweight or with obesity are reported in Table 3.  4. Discussion  The reduction by at least 5% of one’s body weight is linked to improved health outcomes and quality of life for people with overweight and obesity [9]. The European Guidelines for obesity management in adults set this modest weight loss as a goal for people affected by overweight or obesity, underlining that the more weight lost, the more beneficial health effects are seen [41], as also confirmed in other studies [7,10].  In the literature, few studies have evaluated the effects of reaching 5% body weight loss in terms of anthropometric parameters and body composition [7].",a6c7f002-82e8-409f-82b9-9bb5188a49ae
16,methods16," Our study focused on observing the time necessary to reach this target at different ages and Body Mass Index (BMI)s by comparing two nutritional protocols on anthropometric and body composition parameters.  The results of this study confirmed those of other ones in the literature where both the MD and Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)) were efficient in reducing body weight, waist circumference, and fat mass while preserving fat free mass (FFM) and body cellular mass (BCM) in subjects with overweight or obesity [24,34,35,36,37,42,43]. The goal to lose at least 5% of one’s body weight was reached after a month of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)) and after 3 months of MD. In the study of Magkos et al., after 3.5 months, participants lost 5% of their initial body weight following a hypocaloric diet, and they decreased FM by 8%± 3% but also had a 2%± 2% reduction in fat free mass (FFM) [7].",10b5f965-a700-4eac-877f-24c592bfb485
17,methods17," This result is not in line with ours, because in our study we did not observe an fat free mass (FFM) reduction. The preservation of fat free mass (FFM), especially of body cellular mass, is an important issue, as its reduction alters energy metabolism and decreases muscle strength as well as lung and immune capacity [44,45]. Maximizing fat loss while preserving lean mass and its function is a central goal of overweight and obesity treatment [46]; in fact, fat-free mass represents a key determinant of the magnitude of one’s resting metabolic rate (resting metabolic rate (RMR)) [47].  As in other studies in the literature, we observed a significant reduction in body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), WC, and FM after both diets in both male and female groups. The comparison between male groups of both diets showed no significant differences.",15ae6ca1-6619-48fc-8cd8-ebe06794cef1
18,methods18," A couple of literature studies that evaluated the effects of a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)) on the male population were focused on its effect on testicular function [48] or metabolic hypogonadism and beta cell function [49]. Both studies were longer than ours (at least 12 weeks) and had a different aim, so they did not evaluate body composition changes, only body weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) as anthropometrical parameters. In any case, even in these studies, the researchers observed a significant reduction in body weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) compared to baseline [48,49]. Moreover, the effects of MD on anthropometric and body composition parameters in a male population could be seen in the study of Carneiro-Barrera et al., in which 75 males were randomized to a usual care group or an eight-week weight loss and lifestyle intervention group to observe an improvement in sleep apnea.",d3a80d94-5f2d-4bd6-8c7a-f03077cfea32
19,methods19," They reached their goal after a significant reduction in body weight (p < 0.0001) and fat mass (p < 0.0001) thanks to a Mediterranean diet [50]. In terms of female results, in our MD group, there was both a greater reduction in waist circumference and fat mass percentage and a higher increase in total body water percentage and fat-free mass percentage compared to the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)) group. Our study confirmed other results in the literature about weight loss, Body Mass Index (BMI), and WC reduction after one month of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)), and they are also in line with fat free mass (FFM) preservation [51]. The study of Barrea et al.",7b2b3ae1-8255-4bd7-9f4a-c8c791fc696e
20,methods20," observed a significant increase in the phase angle (considered an inflammation marker) in 260 women after 1 month of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)), but in our study, we did not observe any changes in the phase angle in all subgroups [52]. Similar results on anthropometric parameters in women with overweight or obesity were seen in the study of Tragni et al. [53]. This study used 24 weeks of the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)) because it also accounted for the reintroduction phase. In the whole study, patients reduced body weight (−14.6%) and waist circumference (−12.4%), and at the end of the protocol, 33% of participants reached a normal weight [53]. We observed similar results on anthropometric parameters, but our study was shorter because it only considered the active phase.",ea9323e1-a761-4758-8467-fc8aa31b4b31
21,methods21,"  To evaluate the effects of these two different nutritional protocols on fat free mass (FFM), we stratified the population according to age. We chose the threshold of 50 years old because generally, after the 50th year, significant aging processes take place, and every year after the 50th there could be a small physiological loss of fat-free mass and strength [54]. Even if muscle mass tends to decrease physiologically with age, we did not observe any reductions in fat-free mass and body cellular mass after both dietary regimes. Although a diet poor in carbohydrates may increase muscle catabolism [55], exacerbating fat-free mass loss during weight loss, the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)) preserved fat free mass (FFM) and body cellular mass. The same result was seen after the MD. Indeed, both dietary plans could be considered safe for the risk of sarcopenia.",96540860-2b64-4e82-a8d2-8e67b7403ea9
22,methods22," We noticed that in subjects younger than 50 years, the MD was more effective than the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)) in reducing waist circumference (p = 0.0076) and fat mass percentage (p = 0.0019) and in increasing free-fat mass percentage (p = 0.0326) and total body water percentage (p = 0.0040). In the >50 group, there was no difference between the MD and Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)), but we noticed that intragroup, there was a significant increase in fat free mass (FFM) (p < 0.0001 for both diets), and body cellular mass (BCM) was not affected by weight loss. Other studies in the literature did not divide by age, and they usually observed the results on the whole population, which comprised both younger and elder subjects.  5. Conclusions  The original aspect of this study was evaluating the time necessary to at least achieve the goal of 5% of body weight loss with two different dietary treatments.",bbfd8f51-8928-4abd-a44a-b35884fc7df4
23,methods23," We observed that this result was achieved through one month of the Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic diet and three months of the Mediterranean diet.  These two nutritional protocols are adequate for both men and women of different age groups with overweight or obesity. Both dietary programs induced weight and fat mass loss without affecting free-fat mass and body cellular mass.  It is clear that the MD is a nutritional protocol useful for the prevention and management of non-communicable diseases such as obesity and metabolic and cardiovascular diseases with high diet adherence and satisfaction by patients [56], but nowadays, the Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic diet has become even more popular, especially due its rapid effect on weight loss. Thus, people, especially those with severe obesity, are more motivated to follow this nutritional protocol to attain faster results.",9c9bbd6c-8f29-40a2-ab86-b482d39fb846
24,methods24," However, it is important to remember that a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)) is not sustainable in the long term, and it requires a gradual transition to a Mediterranean diet [57]. Therefore, combining these two nutritional therapies might be a winning strategy to help people healthily lose weight, increasing their motivation [11,29,32,33].  The results of this study are promising. The large number of participants and the small number of dropouts are surely a strength of the study. Amongst limitations of the study there is that we did not monitor levels of physical activity and diet adherence with a food diary but relied on participants’ reports of their food intakes during the fortnight phone calls and follow-up visits. This could determine a bias, as subjects might forget some details about their food and drink intakes, as recently highlighted in a systematic review.",3e0b85d3-9688-48f9-9c74-e924109c7674
25,methods25," People tend to frequently misestimate their food portions and sometimes forget their consumptions of some food, such as vegetables or seasonings [58]. In the present study, patients’ reports about their food intakes, in terms of portion sizes and frequencies, were in accordance with those established by the study protocol. Moreover, in our study we focused only on anthropometrical and body composition changes rather than on biochemical assessment (i.e., glycemia and lipid profile). The European Guidelines for obesity management in adults underline that Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD))s determine greater reduction of total cholesterol and serum triglycerides but do not improve glycemic levels, HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, or HDL cholesterol compared to other nutritional protocols for the same time span [14].",5e3a481d-6445-4974-af78-002c9d348014
26,methods26," For a future study, it could be interesting to evaluate the effects of the two nutritional patterns considered in the study on glycemic and lipid profile once the goal of 5% of body weight loss is reached. Another limitation of this study is that our results refer to a short period of time, while it would be interesting to know if these improvements are maintained over time. Studies in the literature show that after 6 months a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)) determines more significant results compared to a hypocaloric diet on weight loss, but after 12 months this difference is no more significant. In fact, people who follow a hypocaloric diet are able to continue losing weight over time, while people who follow a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic diet (VLow Calorie Ketogenic Diet (LCKD)) tend to regain a bit of weight during or after the reintroduction phase [59].",3b48d8d6-a39d-4c2b-9b8c-556f45e10850
27,methods27," Our study, in fact, showed that in two different time spans the results on body weight and body composition are similar, but it could be interesting to schedule a follow-up visit after 6 or 12 months to check weight maintenance, as this is the most challenging aspect of diet therapy [60]. To avoid weight gain after a diet period, it is important to define realistic goals to gradually change lifestyle habits and maintain weight loss over time [41]. These lifestyle changes could be obtained through nutrition education and the permanent acquisition of healthy habits. Counseling, positive reinforcement, and motivation could help patients avoid weight regain [61].  Our study demonstrates that there is not a single strategy for body weight management; in fact, different nutritional protocols (even if in different time spans) can reach the same result in terms of both anthropometrical parameters and body composition changes.",7335ca20-daf2-4254-bc2d-3718c9ec6bde
