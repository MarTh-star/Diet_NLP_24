4,methods4," The children in the two groups were hospitalized for observation for 2 weeks, and the nurses monitored the blood glucose, blood ketone levels and the number of epileptic seizures every 8 hours after enrollment. During hospitalization, nurses instructed the parents to record the children's diet, seizures, and other logs. After discharge, they were followed up by telephone and WeChat every week for 1 year. They were followed up in outpatient clinics once a month three months before discharge, and once in six months thereafter.  2.5. Observation Index  (1) EEG: Japan photoelectric digital electroencephalograph EEG-9200k (Shanghai Jumu Medical Instrument Co. Ltd.) was used to detect the changes, control of epileptiform discharges in children after 6 months and 1 year of treatment, respectively [9].",86115086-22e9-448c-bb6f-007c05b1d371

Discussion  Studies have shown that [13], patients with refractory epilepsy continue to take antiepileptic drug treatment, which cannot reduce the number of seizures, but will increase adverse drug reactions.",3e61e39b-989e-4638-a415-5b1ac196ef54
10,methods10," Therefore, other clinical programs are often used to treat refractory epilepsy, such as neuromodulation electrical stimulation, surgery, and KD therapy. Compared with the former, KD therapy is painless and noninvasive, and the curative effect is more accurate. The specific mechanism is not conclusive; the more accepted view is that the efficacy of KD is the synthesis of various beneficial mechanisms [14]. Prebiotics are organic substances that can selectively promote intestinal metabolism and improve the health of the host, while probiotics can better improve the microecological balance of the human body. Prebiotics/probiotics preparations have been used to treat functional constipation and improve intestinal flora. Combined with KD therapy for the adjuvant treatment of epilepsy, it is still a relatively new research, and it is also the innovation of this research.",e9f47a6b-6c1f-449e-9bc0-d34ea04eb9c8
11,methods11,"  In recent years, domestic reports have shown that [15], KD therapy in children with refractory epilepsy has a higher efficacy than children who did not receive KD intervention. Similarly, this study showed that the effective rate of the combination group at the last follow-up was 95.45%, which was higher than that of the KD group, suggesting that prebiotic/probiotic preparations assisted KD in the treatment of children with refractory epilepsy has a better effect. The mechanism of action is hypothesized to be that the ketone bodies formed from the lipolysis of KD therapy provide an energy source for the brain, increase the level of inhibitory neuropeptides, and regulate the levels of aminobutyric acid and glutamate in the brain, which are related to anticonvulsant and antiepileptic effects. In addition, prebiotic/probiotic preparations can regulate brain blood sugar levels, change glucose metabolism, and inhibit systemic inflammation.",f1208843-1d19-465f-85f8-84dc7c5e46ce
12,methods12," Foreign studies have also confirmed this effect [16]. The combination of the two can achieve a better antiepileptic effect.  EEG is the most intuitive indicator for evaluating the brain function of children with epilepsy, and the type of epileptic seizures can be judged by monitoring the abnormal discharge of children. Foreign studies [17] have shown that the early changes in EEG of patients after KD therapy may be a predictor of patient efficacy. The results of this study showed that after 1 year of treatment, the improvement of EEG in the combination group was better than that in the KD group, and there was no significant difference in the improvement of EEG between the two groups after half a year of treatment. It is suggested that the two programs have the same effect on EEG improvement in the short term, while the long-term effect of the combination group is better.",f952766d-ec0c-4714-8bcc-deeebbd36d53
13,methods13," Moreover, the results showed that the level of 5-HT in the combination group was also higher than that in the KD group, indicating that prebiotic/probiotic preparations assisted by KD treatment can improve the level of neurotransmitters. Analyzing this result, it may be that some neurotransmitters in the organism are produced by the intestinal flora, and the probiotic preparation alters the level of 5-HT by regulating the balance of intestinal flora to protect neurons, thus realizing the regulation of the brain-gut axis pathway and effectively improving the epileptic condition of the children. On the other hand, the levels of VIQ and performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) in the combined group were significantly higher than those in the KD group, suggesting that prebiotic/probiotic preparations assisted by KD in the treatment of children with refractory epilepsy can effectively improve the cognitive level of children.",f4c8f5d8-92a1-4f64-bd13-08d056c9e2cf
14,methods14," In addition, the quality of life of children with epilepsy covers physical, emotional, social, and behavioral aspects. This study also showed that the quality of life score of the combination group was higher than that of the KD group, indicating that prebiotic/probiotic preparations assisted KD in the treatment of children with refractory epilepsy can improve the quality of life of children. Finally, this study found that the incidence of adverse reactions in the combination group was lower than that in the KD group. Previous studies have suggested that [18] KD therapy changes the eating habits of children, so the adverse reactions cannot be avoided; while prebiotic/probiotic preparations can promote intestinal peristalsis by regulating the secretion of 5-HT [19, 20], thereby improving intestinal motility, and the adverse reactions such as constipation and diarrhea in children can be effectively relieved.",46a2eb07-0bc1-4995-a5e5-54dce15fad1a
15,methods15," Nonetheless, because KD therapy is a highly restrictive dietary therapy and relies on the support of hospitals, families, and society, there is no unified conclusion on whether adverse reactions and death are directly related to KD therapy. At present, close follow-up and monitoring are still needed to avoid adverse reactions.  In conclusion, prebiotic/probiotic preparations assisted KD in the treatment of children with refractory epilepsy have better efficacy, which can improve children's EEG and quality of life, improve neurotransmitters and cognitive levels, reduce adverse reactions, and can be used as an effective regimen for treatment of refractory epilepsy. However, the research study is a retrospective analysis, the sample size is insufficient, and there may be a bias in the selection of children. In the future, attention should be paid to such problems, and a large number of clinical trials should be carried out to further demonstrate its clinical value.",f720943c-4073-4397-ac5f-9079f0758c70

19,results1,"  Conclusion  The curative effect of prebiotics/probiotics-assisted KD is better on children with refractory epilepsy, which can effectively improve electroencephalogram and quality of life, increase neurotransmitters and cognitive levels, with good safety. ==== Body pmc1. Introduction  As a relatively common neurological disease, epilepsy refers to brain dysfunction caused by excessive discharge, leading to repeated and transient central nervous system dysfunction [1]. Refractory epilepsy is a kind of epilepsy that has not achieved persistent seizure-free after the correct application of two tolerable antiepileptic drugs [2]. Data show that 20% of children with epilepsy may eventually have refractory epilepsy [3]. Long-term seizures of epilepsy may not only lead to persistent neuropsychiatric disorders, affect the cognitive function of children, but also adversely affect the growth and development of children [4].",232254c9-d6f1-43fb-8a85-9c675683c484
20,results2," The current clinical treatment methods mainly rely on oral antiepileptic drugs, vagus nerve stimulation, and so on. Ketogenic diet (hereinafter referred to as KD) is an important dietary therapy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy, which is economical, practical, and effective [5]. However, the composition of the intestinal flora of children with KD treatment will change, and the diversity and richness of species will be reduced. And recent studies have shown that intestinal flora can also regulate brain function, and the imbalance of intestinal flora may be related to the development and aggravation of epilepsy [6]. There is still a need to explore and develop new adjuvant therapies to improve the intestinal flora and enhance the efficacy of KD. Prebiotics/probiotic preparations are widely used microbial preparations, which can improve the disorder of intestinal flora.",dc32113d-8c75-4405-bf50-307b4d742abc
21,results3," Probiotics have been well used in children with constipation in the past [7], but there are few reports in the field of refractory epilepsy at present, and its selection of indications, patient age, intervention timing, and even specific implementation plan need to be standardized. To this end, this study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 80 children with epilepsy and studied the effect of prebiotic/probiotic preparations assisted by KD in the treatment of children with refractory epilepsy.  2.
