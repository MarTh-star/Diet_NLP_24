1,methods1,"  Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) rat model  Using a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system, we have established a rat model with an out-of-frame mutation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) from the Wistar-Imamichi strain11. The established Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) rats have mutations in exon3 and exon16 in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (cDNA sequence; exon3 del, exon16: c.19491950 insT, c.19521953 CG > AT). Animals were maintained in groups of 2–4 per cage at 23 °C under a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 8 AM) and food and water were supplied ad libitum.  Dietary intervention  Newborn male Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) rats were randomly assigned to 2 groups (n = 6 for each group), those receiving the normal diet (ND) or the medium-chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD))22. Also, their wild-type (WT) littermates fed the ND served as a control group (n = 4).",366cf5a1-17ea-4fc6-be87-4a71f86a8516
2,methods2," The 36-week dietary intervention period was started at the time of weaning (3 weeks of age) and continued until 9 months of age. The animals were fed 2 types of medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD). For the first 10 days, medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) with a ratio of fat weight to carbohydrate plus protein weight (ketogenic ratio; KR) of 2.0 was used. For the remainder of the feeding period, medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) with a KR of 1.4 was used. The calorie ratios in medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) (KR 2.0) derived from fat, carbohydrate, and protein were 82%, 10%, and 8%, respectively.

The calorie ratios in ND (standardized AIN93M feeding) derived from fat, carbohydrate, and protein were 10%, 77%, and 13%, respectively. The calorie counts of medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) (KR 2.0), medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) (KR 1.4), and ND were 6.2 kcal/g, 5.9 kcal/g, and 3.9 kcal/g, respectively.  Electrocardiogram evaluation  Inhalation anesthesia was used during electrocardiogram and echocardiography experiments; Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) rats were anesthetized with 1–3% isoflurane and wild-type rats were anesthetized with 2–4% isoflurane. All rats were placed in a prone position on a heating pad with embedded electrocardiogram leads (THM150, FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Toronto, ON, Canada).",51064dce-00ad-4762-9ad3-d3d4c8cd141d
4,methods4," Each limb was fixed with tape and electrode gel was applied to the electrocardiogram electrodes. The electrocardiogram was sampled every 0.65 ms with a sampling rate of 8000 Hz. Acquired data were exported to an analysis software (Labscribe4 with electrocardiogram analysis module, iWorx Systems, Dover, NH, USA). The electrocardiogram data were filtered by a bandpass filter with a 15 Hz high-frequency passband and a 200 Hz low-frequency passband and the averaged electrocardiogram was automatically generated from 8 to 10 consecutive waveforms (Fig. 1). Electrocardiogram variables of heart rate, P-wave amplitude, R-wave amplitude, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval were automatically measured by the software (n = 6 for ND-fed Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) rats, n = 6 for medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD)-fed Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) rats, n = 4 for WT rats).",e11f9724-dc28-4e06-8598-9d42b2e270de
5,methods5,"  Echocardiography evaluation  Echocardiographic images were acquired under isoflurane anesthesia using a small-animal digital echocardiography imaging system (Vevo®3100, FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Toronto, ON, Canada). Images of short-axis and long-axis views were recorded at frame rates of 100 fps. The obtained digital raw data were transferred to VevoLAB software and speckle tracking strain analysis was performed using VevoStrain software (FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Canada)40,41. From the M-mode short-axis view, LV anterior wall thickness, posterior wall thickness, end-diastolic diameter, and fractional shortening (FS) were calculated. From the LV long-axis view, LV endocardium borders at end-diastole and at end-systole were manually traced and the ejection fraction was calculated using Simpson’s method. Speckle tracking strain analysis variables were also calculated by manual tracing of the LV endocardial and epicardial borders.",823b17b1-1a5b-4cfe-b3a8-8a36a87a6b64
6,methods6," Peak strain values of all LV segments (strain global), peak strain rate at systole (strain rate S-peak), and peak strain rate at early diastole (strain rate E-peak) from circumferential, radial, longitudinal, and transverse standardized strains and strain rates were calculated (Supplemental Fig. 2). Each echocardiographic value was calculated from the average of 3 consecutive heartbeats (n = 6 for ND-fed Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) rats, n = 6 for medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD)-fed Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) rats, n = 4 for WT rats).  Histological analyses  After measuring body weight, the rats were euthanized, and their hearts were weighed. The heart weight ratio was calculated from the whole heart weight divided by their body weight (BW). Paraffin-embedded 4–5 μm thick sections of LV tissue were stained with hematoxylin eosin, Masson’s trichrome, and IgG immunostaining.",351db8a2-49d8-4250-9105-b6e62af8ef81

18,discussion0," We expected to observe the beneficial effects of medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) dietary intervention in cardiac muscle since improvements in skeletal muscle were previously reported22. However, we observed the unexpected negative finding that medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) feeding did not ameliorate cardiomyopathy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) rats, but rather exacerbated the LV dysfunction and fibrosis. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report regarding the effects on cardiac function and pathology by medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) intervention.  Several papers have reported on the beneficial effects of a traditional ketogenic diet, long chain triglycerides (LCT) containing ketogenic diets (long chain triglycerides (LCT)KD), on cardiac function.",db44a075-3e80-41c6-ba5e-01d5a87fa767
19,discussion1," In mouse models, ketogenic diets showed cardio-protective effects in aortic constriction23 and myocardial remodeling24 experiments. In rat models, ketogenic diets showed cardio-protective effects in hypertensive heart disease25–27. Even in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, the infusion of 3-hydroxybutyrate, which is a ketone body that increases plasma 3-hydroxybutyrate, showed beneficial hemodynamic effects28.  In regard to systemic muscle diseases, a lack of protein and carbohydrates in metabolism promotes muscle atrophy19,20. The traditional ketogenic diet has limited efficiency in converting long chain triglycerides (LCT) to ketone bodies15, which results in limitations in the ratio of the protein and carbohydrate concentrations to lipid concentration. From this metabolic point of view, the traditional ketogenic diet long chain triglycerides (LCT) containing ketogenic diets (long chain triglycerides (LCT)KD) may not be suitable for muscle diseases.",516600ce-f09e-4c53-9134-2b12316f1075
20,discussion2," On the other hand, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) reduces the ratio of lipids and increases the ratios of carbohydrates and proteins, which results in more efficient ketone body production than long chain triglycerides (LCT)15 in muscle metabolism. Indeed, medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) showed a beneficial impact on skeletal muscle in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) rats, as we expected22. However, medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) did not ameliorate cardiomyopathy. This discrepancy may have arisen for 3 possible reasons; 1) metabolic differences, 2) exercise load, and 3) regenerative capacity.  Metabolic differences between cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues have been reported.",02a2dd47-1d27-4a5a-9a11-38ae5bfb75ac
21,discussion3," In the skeletal muscle of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), transition to slow-type fibers occurs and as the number of slow-type fibers increases, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is compensatory increased to metabolize fat components29. In the cardiomyopathy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), energy substrates switch from preferentially using fatty acids to glucose oxidation30,31. This metabolic remodeling might be due to the activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle29 and the suppression of PPARs in cardiomyocytes31. Because medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) is a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) skeletal muscles are efficiently supplied with energy, although the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cardiac muscles, which depend on the glycolytic system, may have been suffering from energy deficiency.",7a17bf41-9ca8-4bb0-b29e-88b004aef0ad
22,discussion4,"  Excessive exercise load can exacerbate the cardiomyopathy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In the mdx mice model, treadmill exercise was shown to worsen cardiac function and fibrosis32,33. Also, it was observed that patients with Becker muscular dystrophy present with severe LV dysfunction with mild or no skeletal muscle symptoms34. This suggests that patients with mild skeletal muscle symptoms can exercise, which increases their cardiac workload, resulting in exacerbated cardiomyopathy. In this study, the improvement of skeletal muscle function in the medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD)-fed Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) rats may have increased their physical activity and cardiac load, which may have in turn promoted cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction.  Another possible cause is the difference in the regenerative capacity of skeletal and cardiac muscles.",e02a9227-0fdf-4c95-a631-a46cc598f515
23,discussion5," Although injured skeletal muscle can be quickly regenerated by stem cells, the regenerative capacity of adult mammalian cardiomyocytes is limited35. Therefore, the regeneration-promoting effect of medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD)22 was not as effective in cardiac muscle as in skeletal muscle, leading to inter-tissue differences in the pathological changes.  From a future perspective of improving both skeletal and cardiac muscles simultaneously, modification of the nutritional components of medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) could be an alternative option. According to recent studies, the intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)36 and a decreased ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 PUFA37,38 could ameliorate myocardial fibrosis and heart failure.",9c42dcbd-55fa-44b1-b19b-7901ce244b79
24,discussion6," medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) in the present study contained a large amount of unsaturated fatty acids, mostly omega-6 PUFA, with little omega-3 PUFA. Dietary intake of omega-3 PUFA was shown to improve the skeletal and cardiac muscles of mdx mice by reducing inflammation and promoting muscle regeneration39. Therefore, the modification of medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) fat components, in which some of the omega-6 PUFA are replaced with omega-3 PUFA, is expected to be an effective dietary treatment option for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) skeletal muscle myopathy as well as the cardiomyopathy.  Limitations  Because the number of animals to be examined was limited, many variables did not reach statistical significance.",dd7b4f3d-5b6a-4ba8-bede-c6a2613ac915
25,discussion7," In human clinical echocardiography, Simpson’s method, the longitudinal strain/strain rate, and transverse strain/strain rate are usually analysed using the apical long-axis approach. However, in this study, we used the parasternal long-axis view to analyse these variables, because of the limited image quality of the animal apical long-axis view40,41. Moreover, the ratio of frame rates to the animal heart rates was limited for obtaining adequate 2D echocardiographic results of traced EF and strain variables. Therefore, the results for these variables in the present animal experiments may not be suitable to compare with the values in patients in clinical settings.  Conclusion  The present findings demonstrated that medium chain triglyceride containing ketogenic diet (medium chain triglycerides (MCT)KD) dietary intervention in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) rats, which dramatically improved the skeletal muscle myopathy, did not improve their cardiomyopathy.",1afa410d-2b3b-4a2c-b1c4-25ba6d3a980e
