0,introduction0,"Ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate and adequate-protein diet characterized by producing a state of ketosis in the organism. The term ketogenic diet was first coined at Mayo Clinic in 1921 and derives its name from the fact that it increases the circulating concentration of the ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone (Wheless, 2008). These ketone bodies, particularly β-hydroxybutyrate, can replace glucose as fuel for cells. The synthesis of ketone bodies begins once glycogen stores have depleted in the liver. Thus, the KD is a biochemical model of fasting, where cells use ketone bodies as energy substrate . KD was initially employed as an effective non-pharmacological treatment for refractory epilepsy with beneficial results . However, in recent years, it has demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of numerous neurological disorders such as traumatic brain injury (Appelberg et al.",feed2a20-37c0-4f91-8286-b6574506fd6d
1,introduction2,", 2012) are known to be caused by the dysfunction of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA))-mediated neurotransmission . It is well known that the strength and polarity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neurotransmission are determined by the intracellular chloride concentration, which in turn is regulated by cation-chloride cotransporters and is indeed essential for neuronal homeostasis activity in the brain. The main chloride “exporter” is the K+/Cl– cotransporter (KCC2), which can extrude chloride from the neuron against its concentration gradient. In opposite direction, the Na+/K+/Cl– cotransporter (NKCC1) is regarded as the most active chloride “importer”. Together, KCC2 and NKCC1 are the two main transporters responsible for regulating intracellular chloride concentration .",29c865d3-21db-4616-bb9c-eb011cc03e5a
2,introduction3,"  Recent studies have reported alterations of NKCC1 or KCC2 cotransporters in multiple models of neurological and psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia , autism (Cellot and Cherubini, 2014; Merner et al., 2015), Down syndrome , epilepsy , cerebral ischemia , tuberous sclerosis complex , traumatic brain injury , neuropathic pain  and stress . KCC2 is down-regulated while NKCC1 is up-regulated under certain pathophysiological conditions, such as epilepsy and trauma . These studies underpin the importance of NKCC1 and KCC2 regulation for the homeostasis of neuronal intracellular chloride concentration and appropriate function of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling.",5d1fd8f5-a638-4ac9-9d46-1e7e59b02539
3,introduction4,"  Some studies have shown that the efficacy of KD is manifested after 1 month of treatment in animal models. In a previous study of our group (Gómez-Lira et al., 2011), we reported that KD per se does not alter the expression of the cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2 in the hippocampus after 1 month of treatment, however, Wang et al. (2016) reported that KD increases the expression of KCC2 cotransporter in the cerebral cortex after a month of diet.  The mechanism by which KD acts is not clearly understood. However, it is important to note that KD has a beneficial effect in several diseases or disorders where gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic system failure is involved, probably by modifying the cation-chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2 as a common mechanism. However, so far, there are no studies that have analyzed the long-term effect of KD per se on the expression of the cation-chloride cotransporters in the dentate gyrus.",2ad3f1a0-acda-4ad8-b6c3-8c88e1fdfcd0
4,introduction5," Hence, the present work was focused to analyzing the long-term effect of KD on the expression of cation-chloride cotransporters, particularly in the dentate gyrus. In view of this, the total number of NKCC1 immunoreactive (NKCC1-IR) neuronal and glial cells was estimated by stereology, while KCC2 labeling intensity was determined by optical densitometry in the molecular and granule layers and in hilus of dentate gyrus of rats after 3 months of normal diet or KD administration.

To select the sections from the serial slides per animal, we use a systematic random procedure consisting of choosing one of every eight sections that resulted in eight series of 12–15 sections of all rat dentate gyrus. One of the series was immunohistochemically processed for immunodetection of NKCC1 and other for KCC2 in each rat.  Immunohistochemical Staining To evaluate the expression of the cation-chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2 in ND and KD rats, an immunohistochemistry protocol was carried out using a secondary biotinylated antibody according to Brandt et al.

9,methods4," Sections were initially subjected to three-time 10-min washes with PBS, between the change of each solution and at the end. After washing with PBS, sections were subjected to 1% hydrogen peroxide in PBS during 10 min.

Finally, the sections were mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated slides, entellan (Merck, Germany) was added and slides covered with a glass coverslip. In additional sections, the primary antibody NKCC1 or KCC2 as well as the secondary biotinylated antibody were omitted as negative controls to assess non-specific binding. The same amount of horse serum used to replace the primary or secondary antibody resulted in lack of any staining. Evaluation of sections was performed in a blind fashion, i.e., the researcher was not aware whether sections were from ND or KD rats.  Immunofluorescence To further investigate the cell lineage of NKCC1-IR and KCC2-IR cells, co-staining of NKCC1 or KCC2 was realized with NeuN (a neuron-specific marker), GFAP (a marker for astrocytes) and DAPI (nuclear staining).",c17a5420-c99d-4954-b483-ec5e70fc9ad3

Stereology for NKCC1 A stereological, systematic random procedure, optical fractionator,  was employed for counting the number of NKCC1-IR neuronal and glial cells in dentate gyrus of both ND and KD fed rats. To achieve this, we used Stereo Investigator 9 software in a semi-automatic stereological system (MBF Bioscience, VT, United States). The counting frame size was set at 70 × 45 μm, height dissector 13 μm, and guard zones were defined at 1.5 μm from the upper and lower borders of the counting frame. Grid size was set at 300 × 300 μm, except for the granular layer, for which was set at 250 × 250 μm.",89a2aad4-f000-4b3b-94a1-a6e1ba8174f9

(2010), following the criteria of size and morphologic appearance. Thus, we considered NKCC1-IR glial cells as those with small-sized profiles (<8 μm) and intensely staining, and as NKCC1-IR neural cells, those with large-sized profiles (>8 μm) and staining from slightly to considerably darker than background.  Optical Density of KCC2 The determination of KCC2 cotransporter expression in the dentate gyrus was done through digital densitometrical analysis of the image color intensities.",5c4e447d-7ff1-451a-898b-d692026bb221

ImageJ software (v 1.52e, Rasband, 2018) was used to perform densitometric measurements and the values obtained were expressed as optical density (OD) in arbitrary units; for each image, we converted RGB to 8-bit color depth, segmented the layers of interest and measured the relative intensity of pixels in each region. The analysis was made at 20× in series of 12–15 sections of whole dentate gyrus. Optical density of KCC2 was estimated in three regions: molecular and granule layers and hilus of the dentate gyrus.

Specifically, an increased KCC2 cotransporter expression was observed in the granule layer and hilus of dentate gyrus, which was not observed in the molecular layer. The ketogenic diet did not modify the NKCC1-IR neuronal and glial cells number in any of the layers analyzed. Interestingly, there were more NKCC1-IR glial cells than NKCC1-IR neural cells. The low neural expression of NKCC1 is in line with previous studies in adult rats .

29,discussion1,"  These results complement our previous work, where it was shown that KD per se does not modify the expression of the cation-chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2 when the diet is provided for only a month (Gómez-Lira et al., 2011). Hence, the results of this work and those of our previous study indicate the necessity of long-term administration of ketogenic diet (3 months) to achieve effects in the KCC2 cotransporter.  The dentate gyrus is an important region of the hippocampal formation which has been the focus of synaptic plasticity, memory and learning process (Alkadhi, 2019), and epilepsy  studies among others in rodents. So, this structure is an ideal model to elucidate the differential effects produced by KD. The dentate gyrus normally functions as a filter (Cohen et al.",8df79be4-703c-4767-a6b3-fc22f4cb9c64
30,discussion2,", 2003) and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synaptic inhibition in the dentate gyrus is thought to endow this hippocampal subregion with the ability to function as a low pass filter, impeding excessive or aberrant activity from propagating into the circuit making the hippocampus to be more prone to seizure .  Abnormalities in the dentate gyrus are likely to play a major role in the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases such as epilepsy and brain injury. Also, it is noted in experimental epilepsy and brain injury that the dentate gyrus is more excitable in these situations, probably due to alterations in gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibition , produced in turn by changes in the cation-chloride cotransporters.",490f4800-dc71-471c-94ca-5bc28ad4b58a
31,discussion3,"  The intracellular chloride concentration determines the strength and polarity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neurotransmission, thus the efficacy of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition depends on the low intracellular chloride concentration maintenance, regulated in turn by KCC2, which is the main chloride exporter. In this work, we brought into evidence increased KCC2 cotransporter in the dentate gyrus of rats after a treatment with KD. Further studies are needed to determine whether this increase in KCC2 expression underlies a hyperpolarizing effect of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neurotransmission.  The beneficial effect of KD in the diseases where gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic system and the dentate gyrus are damaged is probably due, at least in part, to the increase of KCC2.",5cac83f2-5205-4ed3-b897-866cb4ea9a8f
32,discussion4," In addition, an increase of KCC2 in dentate gyrus may contribute in improving the function of the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic system and modulate neuronal excitability, benefiting both cognitive deficits and epilepsy. This hypothesis needs to be evaluated in future studies.  In contrast, when chloride extrusion is disrupted due to decreased expression of KCC2, the intracellular chloride concentration inside the neuron increases, diminishing the driving force for gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory currents which results in significant disinhibition , especially in the dentate gyrus, as seen in neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases like epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia, autism, in addition to stress . Interestingly in these diseases, the beneficial effect of ketogenic diet has been demonstrated.",d1a31a61-a980-45f8-afe9-9654a1aed339
33,discussion5," KD could also have positive effects on other diseases such as neuropathic pain, Rett syndrome associated with autism, tuberous sclerosis and stroke in which KCC2 reduction has been seen.  In this work, we demonstrated that KD produces an over expression of KCC2 cotransporter in neuronal cells in the rat dentate gyrus. It is possible that these cells may also exhibit an upregulation of KCC2 activity that leads to a decrease in [Cl–]i and consequently, an increase the magnitude of the inhibitory response to gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, future studies should be conducted to explore the effect of a ketogenic diet on NKCC1 and KCC2 phosphorylation by WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway [WNK (kinase with no lysine (K)), SPAK (STE20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase) as well as OSRI (oxidative stress-responsive kinasa-1)], their upstream regulatory serine-threonine kinases.",b551f25d-f772-4059-b824-59b9c51ffba7
34,discussion6," WNK kinases are not only effector kinases that work in conjunction with the SPAK/OSR1 kinases to regulate cation-chloride cotransporters by phosphorylation, but may also serve as intracelular Cl– sensors (Moriguchi et al., 2005; Arroyo et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2019).  At the end of the experiment, β-hydroxybutyrate peripheral blood concentration increased, indicating the effectiveness of ketogenic diet used in this work. In addition, a state of ketosis endures after 3 months of treatment. A proposed mechanism for the ketogenic diet action is through the β-hydroxybutyrate.  Some studies have reported that KD reduces seizure-like activity , and normalizes various aberrant aspects of synaptic transmission , in addition, attenuates pathological sharp waves . Bough et al.",2650fed4-a3b6-4242-b115-641614c94a71
35,discussion7," (2003), showed that ketogenic calorie-restricted diet enhances gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibition in vivo in rat dentate gyrus.  In contrast, KD feeding does not affect baseline excitability in the normal hippocampus, Stafstrom et al. (1999), found that KD does not modify aspects of synaptic transmission. These differences could be due to the duration of treatment with the ketogenic diet and the structure analyzed in the brain. As reported, KD per se presents differential effects that affect KCC2 expression in different structures such as the cerebral cortex  or the dentate gyrus (results of this work). The effect also depends on the treatment time. For instance, KCC2 increases in cerebral cortex in 1 month of treatment with KD, but not in the dentate gyrus, while this effect is observed in the dentate gyrus with 3 months of treatment.",c7a7a8fd-e0d0-4465-a0dd-baa953490dac
36,discussion8,"  Previous studies have proposed the possibility that KD effects may reach optimum status in hyperexcitable states as in epileptic condition. Clearly, more studies of KD effects on dentate gyrus regional expression of NKCC1 and KCC2 in a model of epilepsy are required. Little is known about regional alterations in dentate gyrus after applying a KD diet for 3 months.  Wang showed that KD per se, as in the present work, increases the expression of KCC2 without altering NKCC1. This author evaluated the expression of NKCC1 and KCC2 in an animal model of epilepsy and found that the PTZ (pentylenetetrazol) group treated with KD presented an overexpression of KCC2, and a reduction in the expression of NKCC1. These previous evidences and the results of the present work indicate that a mechanism of KD, as a non-pharmacological treatment for the control of the epilepsy, is probably by increasing KCC2 expression in the motor cortex , or in our case, in the dentate gyrus.",4e5a2013-4227-4357-bd34-e4e006eca554
37,discussion9," However, further research is needed to confirm this last hypothesis.  In conclusion, KD provided during 3 months increases KCC2 expression but not NKCC1 in the dentate gyrus of rat. The significant increase of KCC2 expression could explain, at least in part, the beneficial effect of KD in the diseases where the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic system is altered by increasing the inhibitory efficiency thus, causing the abolition of dysfunction of the dentate gyrus.
