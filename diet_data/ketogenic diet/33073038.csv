0,background0," An underlying cause of solid tumor resistance to chemotherapy treatment is diminished tumor blood supply, which leads to a hypoxic microenvironment, dependence on anaerobic energy metabolism, and impaired delivery of intravenous treatments. Preclinical data suggest that dietary strategies of caloric restriction and low-carbohydrate intake can inhibit glycolysis, while acute exercise can transiently enhance blood flow to the tumor and reduce hypoxia. The Diet Restriction and Exercise-induced Adaptations in Metastatic Breast Cancer (DREAM) study will compare the effects of a short-term, 50% calorie-restricted and ketogenic diet combined with aerobic exercise performed during intravenous chemotherapy treatment to usual care on changes in tumor burden, treatment side effects, and quality of life.

1,methods0," Design and ethics  The DREAM study is a two-arm, parallel-group, phase II randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03795493). A summary of the study design is illustrated in Fig. 1. The Health Research Ethics Board of Alberta Cancer Committee approved this study (HREBA.CC-18-0657), and all participants will provide written informed consent. The study is taking place at a single study site in Edmonton, Canada at the University of Alberta and the Cross Cancer Institute, a tertiary care cancer treatment hospital. The study team will communicate any important protocol modifications to the trial registry and research ethics board. Fig. 1 Study design. CT = computed tomography; w = weeks  Randomization  The randomization will employ a permutated block design with random block sizes of four and six, and a 1:1 allocation ratio to usual care or the combined diet and exercise intervention. Randomization will be stratified by the active line of intravenous chemotherapy (i.e.",a6079179-b2ad-434c-8cf5-ec94cf48ce97
2,methods1,", first, second, or ≥ third), as further lines of treatment are known to confer shorter periods of disease control compared to earlier lines [27]. An external party to the study will use a random spreadsheet function to generate the randomization sequence and will place the group assignment into sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. The study coordinator will gain written consent from the participants and perform the randomization following completion of all baseline assessments.  Blinding  It will not be possible to blind participants to their group assignment. Group assignment preference could influence patient-reported outcomes and adherence but is unlikely to influence physical outcome measures. All study outcome assessment and analyses with subjective input will be performed blinded to group assignment.  Patients and recruitment  Participant eligibility criteria are listed in Table 1.",74916417-b772-4ec8-9ea8-f8d15086d15c

If the treating medical oncologist approves of the patient’s participation, they will obtain consent from the patient for the study coordinator to contact them. The treating medical oncologists can also alert the study team to potential participants in their care as they become eligible (i.e., switching to a new treatment line).",9972aa7a-3202-4d0c-85b6-017df8492491

The exercise physiologist will ask the participant about physical activity habits and experience and develop individualized recommendations consistent with the guidelines.  Diet and exercise intervention group  Participants assigned to the intervention group will consume a provided diet for 48–72 h prior to each chemotherapy treatment and perform cycle ergometer exercise during each chemotherapy infusion, up to a maximum of six treatment cycles of the same line, in addition to usual cancer care. If the treatment line changes at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist prior to the completion of the six cycles, the intervention will be stopped, and the participant will complete the end of study assessments.",735561a8-f88c-4c00-86b3-f9be7f68f36c
8,methods7,"  Diet intervention  In the 72 h prior to each scheduled start time of chemotherapy treatment, participants will be asked to consume only the provided study diet. When there are < 7 days between infusions (i.e., weekly protocols), participants will follow the diet protocol for 48 h prior to that treatment to reduce the number of days in consecutive weeks spent in a calorie deficit to avoid significant weight loss. Participants will choose three meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and two snacks per planned day of the diet from a study menu with 3–4 options for each meal for each treatment (meal descriptions provided in Table 2). The study team designed the menu such that the total caloric content will provide 50% of daily energy expenditure (EE). Daily EE is measured in intervention participants prior to the first treatment cycle on intervention as 1.4 multiplied by the resting energy expenditure (REE) (assessment described below).",40254041-9adc-440d-a810-f01c6d308cc3
9,methods8," The three meals are isocaloric, with each representing 25% of daily EE and each snack representing 12.5%. Additionally, each meal and snack will have a macronutrient composition designed to induce ketosis, with 80% of the calories coming from fat, and 10% coming from each protein and carbohydrates calculated using Food Processor SQL v11.0.3 (ESHA Research, Salem, OR) [28]. When combined with 50% caloric restriction, the 10% carbohydrate composition will provide 22–30 g/day of carbohydrates in the range of daily EE for this population (50% daily EE expected to range from 900 to 1200 kcal based on past experience). The study team will freshly prepare the food in a metabolic kitchen. Each meal and snack will be individually packaged, labelled, and placed in an insulated cooler for pickup by the participant. Participants will also be asked to complete a study diary describing any dietary deviation from the provided food and any adverse nutrition impact symptoms experienced (e.g.",e5f42b88-00ea-4798-a3d7-7c0df9aba6f6

The chemotherapy nurse assigned to the participant for that day will perform the pre-treatment assessment and establish the intravenous line access (either via insertion of peripheral venous cannula or use of established tunneled central venous catheter) in the chemotherapy chair before the participant is carefully transferred to the cycle ergometer for exercise. The pre-exercise preparation for common chemotherapy protocols is described in Table 3.",da5d8eea-b4be-454f-9e11-77fc3b92827a
13,methods12," For example, for taxane-based chemotherapy protocols with a greater risk of an acute adverse reaction, the participant will remain seated in the chair for the first 15 min of the infusion and then be carefully moved to the cycle ergometer. During the exercise session, the exercise physiologist will monitor blood pressure (automated cuff in chemotherapy unit), heart rate (Polar OH1+ armband monitor, Polar Canada, Quebec, Canada) and arterial oxygen saturation (finger clip oximeter), and subjective rating of perceived exertion. Based on the rodent proof-of-concept studies, moderate-intensity exercise is sufficient to enhance tumor blood flow substantially [10, 11]. Moderate-intensity will be prescribed for the participants as 40 to 60% of age-predicted heart rate reserve (calculated as: [220 - age - resting heart rate (measured in chemotherapy chair)] * intensity + resting heart rate).",c36fe509-fbda-4e08-94c4-a6727a644a7c
14,methods13," Participants will be encouraged to work toward the upper end of the intensity range, dependent on abilities. The session duration will be adapted to the chemotherapy protocol to ensure the generalizability of the intervention (Table 3). Typically, sessions will consist of a 5-min warm-up, 30–60 min at the target heart rate and a 5-min cool-down. An additional 5–10 min of warm-up or cool-down may be performed on case-by-case basis due to delays to infusion initiation or completion (e.g., unit patient load, post-treatment intravenous flush length). If required, 2-min breaks will be provided up to a maximum of every 8 min to enable rest but limit the time with reduced blood flow.",a7e1afc4-0508-4748-892b-85e9efa08546

We will use indirect calorimetry with a metabolic cart and ventilated hood system (VMax Encore, Vyaire Medical, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) in the morning after a 12-h water-only fast. We will perform gas and flow meter calibration prior to each test according to manufacturer instructions. Participants will rest supine for 10 min, then a clear dome and canopy will be placed over their head and shoulders.",86d10d36-10c3-4033-a16b-d02e32f25782
37,methods36," We will use only steady-state values (defined as ≤10% variation over 5 min) of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production to calculate resting energy expenditure (REE). After collecting 15 min of steady-state data or 30 min total, we will terminate the test.  The Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire [41] and the Nutrition Quest Brief Food Questionnaire (Berkley Analytics Inc., www.NutritionQuest.com) will be used to assess self-reported exercise and general nutrition habits for the most recent 3 month period, respectively. Both questionnaires will be administered prior to randomization and again after up to six treatment cycles. To assess intervention acceptability, we will use a modified version of a prospective motivational evaluation of the diet and exercise intervention which asks participants to anticipate how beneficial, enjoyable, supported, motivated, and difficult it would be for them to complete the interventions.",d1476d79-4af3-4ad6-ae24-a4abd121f6b7
38,methods37," After completion of the intervention, the intervention group participants will complete a retrospective motivational evaluation in which they will be asked to report how beneficial, enjoyable, supported, motivated, and difficult it was [42].  Data management  The confidentiality of enrolled participants will be protected by use of unique, random study identification numbers for each participant used on all study data collection. The study personnel and investigators will securely store de-identified research data on network drives where it will only be accessible by members of the study team and their delegates. All data entered electronically will be double-checked for accuracy.  Participant reimbursement  Reimbursements will be provided for parking expenses for all study visits, and there is no charge associated with the intervention (including food) and assessments.",47809951-b520-46f8-9ea2-5d312498a0fe
39,methods38,"  Sample size determination  As no prior studies have measured the combined or independent effects of our interventions on tumor response to chemotherapy, we calculated a sample size intended to capture a clinically relevant effect using G*Power software (version 3.1.9.2, Düsseldorf, Germany) [43]. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines use a 30% reduction in tumor size from baseline as clinically relevant threshold to indicate a partial response. Based on this, we assumed that a clinically relevant intervention effect size would be a mean of 30 percentage point difference between groups. Taking into account the variation in subtypes of metastatic breast cancer and chemotherapy protocols, we estimated a mean tumor size reduction of − 10 to − 20% for the usual care group, with a wide standard deviation of 35%. Therefore, using a mean − 50% reduction in the intervention group and a standard deviation of 35 would provide an effect size of Cohen’s d = 0.",a35ef54b-b1b2-44cd-961f-e198aa371ad3
40,methods39,"857 (or Cohen’s f = 0.4285). A total sample size of 45 patients with an alpha of 0.05 would provide 80% power to detect this effect size. An additional 10% will be recruited (n = 50 total, n = 25 per group) to account for withdrawals and mortality during the intervention period.  Statistical analyses  The primary analyses will be intention-to-treat. Per-protocol analyses will also be performed based on adherence to all aspects of the intervention as well as achievement of ketone production. If substantial differences in adherence to the diet and exercise aspects of the intervention occur, then we will also perform sensitivity analysis to determine the individual impact of each intervention on outcomes. To assess for differences between groups in change in all tumor response outcomes, we will use a one-way analysis of covariance with baseline lesion size as a covariate.",a772342b-c1c3-4e24-851e-6e3b0c8c5227
41,methods40," Other potential covariates that will be tested for inclusion will be estrogen/ progesterone receptor status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status, age, and number of received treatments during the study period. To assess the effect of the intervention on the questionnaire data, generalized linear mixed models will be used (fixed factors = group, time, group*time; random factor = participant). The Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazard models will be used to compare unadjusted and adjusted survival between groups.  Data monitoring and adverse events  The low risks associated with the diet and exercise components of the intervention do not necessitate a data monitoring committee. Participants assigned to the intervention group will report non-emergent symptoms or adverse events in their food diary during the diet period. This will be reviewed by the exercise physiologist upon arrival for their exercise session to confirm completion and accuracy.",fdcfa767-b0aa-4b30-ba93-91ad69d0d477
42,methods41," Participants will also have contact info for the study staff during the diet period (including weekends) for any perceived emergent concerns. The exercise physiologist will monitor any symptoms or adverse events which occur during the exercise session. Serious adverse events will be reported to study doctors and the research ethics board.  Dissemination  The study results will be published in a peer-reviewed clinical journal. Co-authorship will be provided to the study team members who meet the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors criteria for authorship. Participants will receive a lay summary of the study results. The study results will also be disseminated by the study sponsors to their stakeholders. Due to research ethics board requirements, the full dataset will not be publicly available. However, de-identified study data will be provided to interested parties upon reasonable request.

43,discussion0," Exercise and diet are attractive supportive therapies for individuals diagnosed with cancer because they are easily accessible, inexpensive, associated with improvements to physical fitness and quality of life, and have few risks or side effects [44]. Nearly all exercise and diet research performed in populations with breast cancer has focused on women with early-stage disease (stages I-III) who have an 89% 5-year survival rate. In contrast, metastatic disease (stage IV) remains incurable, with a 26% 5-year survival rate. The current study proposes a novel, short-term diet and exercise intervention targeting mechanisms of tumor resistance to chemotherapy with the potential to reduce treatment-induced oxidative injury to healthy tissues. The timing of the intervention delivery is optimal for patient adherence as it aligns with the nadir of treatment symptoms (i.e.",4cf55829-6c48-4ed5-9f47-b63679c076b2
44,discussion1,", the end of each chemotherapy cycle) and the acute dose of diet and exercise is more manageable for a wider range of patients than consistent long-term adherence to diet and exercise.  This study design is innovative as it will determine the intervention efficacy in a short-term longitudinal study design rather than reliance on longer-term outcomes that may require several years of follow-up for the primary outcome by utilizing: 1) patients with measurable metastases; and 2) CT for tumor size and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for novel measures of tumor response. A reduction in tumor size within the intervention group is expected to translate to improved cancer outcomes including disease progression, overall survival, and quality of life, and thereby will have a direct impact on reducing health care costs.",b70e9ca0-f978-4f53-83f8-abab7f9c2de0
45,discussion2," If found to be beneficial, the accessibility, ease of uptake by a wide range of patient demographics, and cost-efficacy of these interventions relative to drug development, increases the feasibility of their widespread adoption within cancer treatment centers as part of supportive care. Furthermore, an acute exercise and caloric restriction intervention may empower patients with metastatic breast cancer by allowing them to be actively engaged with their treatment.  An important practical challenge with the exercise intervention that is also likely to exist at other cancer treatment centers is the scarce space available in the outpatient chemotherapy treatment unit. At our center, there was only one space identified that can accommodate the recumbent cycle ergometer beside the chemotherapy chair without encroaching on the adjacent patient space.",71419fb2-f492-4939-aa62-cd608c5ac516
46,discussion3," Due to the high patient load of the chemotherapy unit, the space is only available to schedule the exercise/treatment sessions on 1 day of the week. Therefore, this limited access precludes the participation of certain patients whose clinic and treatment days cannot practically be modified. A second challenge to the exercise session is adapting the exercise intervention to the various infusion protocols. To enhance generalizability of the study, patients on any intravenous chemotherapy protocol can be included and we adopted the same general principles of exercise prescription across protocols. Finally, an important practical challenge related to diet is the need to include dairy and/or meat products in the ketogenic diet, limiting our ability to include participants on strict vegetarian and vegan diets.",ab5a1c7c-20df-4f11-9474-da034e7f8a14
47,discussion4,"  In addition to these practical challenges, limitations of this study include a single site, small sample size, and inability to blind participants and their clinicians to group assignment. The lack of blinding potentially introduces bias in group assignment adherence and our patient-reported outcomes. Furthermore, our primary outcome of tumor size is based on change of size rather than Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) category of change to enhance statistical power to detect a difference in this early phase II trial. After project completion, the next steps will be to design and perform a phase III clinical trial that is adequately powered to detect a between-group difference in the categorical Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (complete or partial response) as this is the gold standard for assessing outcome of a clinical trial.",3cfc662d-d2a3-4098-938f-b46e3d1baa0d
48,discussion5," We will evaluate the feasibility and adherence of the tested interventions in the current study to adapt for further study.  In summary, the DREAM study will evaluate the effect of a short-term diet and exercise approach on chemotherapy treatment response in patients with metastatic breast cancer. These lifestyle interventions are prescribed with the therapeutic goals of inhibition of anaerobic glucose metabolism (by a 50% caloric restricted and ketogenic diet) and increasing tumor blood flow to reduce hypoxia and increase delivery of chemotherapy by aerobic exercise concurrent to intravenous chemotherapy infusion. Targeting mechanisms of tumor resistance to treatment is anticipated to translate to enhanced efficacy of chemotherapy treatment and hence greater tumor response to therapy.",a38dc38e-a166-4dc1-8a75-87d4d16da090
