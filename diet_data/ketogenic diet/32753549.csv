0,methods0," 2.1. Primary Cultures of Neonatal Cardiomyocytes and Fibroblasts  Primary cultures of cardiomyocytes were prepared from 1-day-old Crl: (WI) BR-Wistar rats. Cardiomyocyte- and fibroblast-rich fractions were obtained by centrifugation through a discontinuous Percoll gradient. Cardiomyocytes were cultured in complete medium containing Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 supplemented with 5% horse serum, 4 μg/mL transferrin, 0.7 ng/mL sodium selenite, 2 g/L bovine serum albumin (fraction V), 3 mM pyruvate, 15 mM Hepes (pH 7.1), 100 μM ascorbate, 100 mg/L ampicillin, 5 mg/L linoleic acid, and 100 μM 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine. Culture dishes were coated with 0.3% gelatin. Fibroblasts were cultured with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cardiomyocyte viability was examined using trypan blue dye exclusion.  2.2. Immunoblot Analyses  Heart homogenates or cell lysates were prepared using a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.",fd72e41b-c9f9-4b63-a1d3-3eaeb8a7f0b5

Total protein lysates (10–30 µg) were incubated with SDS sample buffer (Final concentration: 100 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromophenol blue] at 95 °C for 5–20 min). For SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, the lysates were prepared with lysis buffer containing 100 mM N-ethylmaleimide and SDS sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol. For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were incubated with Flag-agarose. Immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer three times and eluted with 2 × SDS sample buffer.",2a004dfc-104a-4023-bf0a-839c5850f4da
2,methods3," The signal intensity of the phosphorylated or acetylated proteins was normalized by that of the relevant total protein. Normalized signal intensity relative to the control was used for statistical analyses of one or more Western blot membranes.  2.3. Adenovirus Vectors  Adenovirus vectors expressing Flag- and HA-Tagged Trx1 (Flag-Trx1-HA) and shTrx1 were generated with the AdMax system as described previously [7]. Ad-shHDAC1 was generated using 19 nucleotides corresponding to the mouse HDAC1 N-terminal region.  2.4. Ketogenic Diet  C57BL/6 mice (11-week-old) were fed a control (D10070802) or ketogenic diet (D10070801) for 5 days. Diets were purchased from Research Diets, Inc (New Brunswick, NJ, USA). The control diet consisted of 10% protein, 80% carbohydrates and 10% fat, whereas ketogenic diet consisted of 10% protein and 90% fat [17].",1e54210d-244a-4448-b888-3ff39059fb6c

All error bars represent S.E.M.  3. Results  3.1. βHB Upregulates Trx1  To examine the effect of βHB upon Trx1 expression, primary cultured cardiomyocytes were treated with 0.1 to 10 mM βHB for 16 h. The circulating level of βHB is 0.4–0.5 mM in non-diabetic patients at baseline [18]. This is significantly higher in diabetic patients at baseline or in response to fasting in non-diabetic patients. We have previously shown that 1 mM βHB affects signaling in cardiomyocytes [10]. Therefore, we chose dosages of βHB ranging from 0.1 to 10 mM. βHB upregulated Trx1 in a dose-dependent manner from 0.",b8eff690-b930-4b6c-a492-172bb5355db6
4,methods5,"1 mM to 3 mM, whereas 10 mM βHB induced Trx1 less effectively than other dosages (Figure 1A). βHB also upregulated Prdx1, a Trx1 substrate, at 0.1 and 0.3 mM. In contrast, the levels of other factors previously reported to act protectively against diabetic cardiomyopathy, including Sirt1, Nampt, and Namnat1, were not significantly changed by the βHB treatment. βHB (1 mM) also upregulated Trx1 in a time-dependent manner (Figure 1B). Significant upregulation of Trx1 was observed as early as 20 min after βHB treatment, reached a plateau at 1 h, and was sustained for 24 h, the longest time point evaluated. Thus, βHB upregulates Trx1 in cardiomyocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. To examine whether βHB also upregulates Trx1 in cardiac fibroblasts, cells were treated with 3 mM βHB for 16 h. βHB-induced Trx1 upregulation was also observed in cardiac fibroblasts (Figure 1C). Ketogenic diet consumption for 5 days also upregulated Trx1 in mouse hearts in vivo (Figure 1D).",cbb42ef0-b691-4f00-acab-f1ca1d08f276
5,methods6," Taken together, these results suggest that βHB, a ketone body, upregulates Trx1 in the heart in a cell autonomous manner.  3.2. βHB Confers Resistance against Oxidative Stress through a Trx1-Dependent Manner  To examine whether βHB induces resistance against oxidative stress in a Trx1-dependent manner, cardiomyocytes were treated with H2O2 in the presence of βHB with or without short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated downregulation of Trx1. We confirmed that βHB-induced Trx1 upregulation was abolished in the presence of adenovirus harboring Trx1 shRNA (shTrx1) but did not control shRNA (Figure 2A). βHB attenuated H2O2-induced cardiomyocyte death, as evaluated with trypan blue staining, but the effect was abolished in the presence of Trx1 knockdown (Figure 2B). Compared to 1 mM βHB, 10 mM βHB did not significantly attenuate H2O2-induced cardiomyocyte death (Figure 2C). This is consistent with the fact that 10 mM βHB no longer significantly upregulates Trx1 compared to 0.",f1611b94-f8d6-4b5d-bfca-c53977325ad5
6,methods7,"3–3 mM βHB (Figure 1A). These results suggest that βHB protects cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress through endogenous Trx1.  3.3. βHB Prevents H2O2-Induced mTOR Inhibition in a Trx1-Dependent Manner  To investigate whether βHB potentiates Trx1 functions, the effect of βHB on mTOR, a known Trx1 substrate [6], was examined. As shown previously, following H2O2 treatment, the mTOR in cardiomyocytes exhibited a band shift to higher molecular weights in SDS-PAGE analyses under non-reducing conditions, whereas the band shift was abolished under reducing conditions in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME) (Figure 3A) [6]. These results suggest that mTOR forms intermolecular disulfide bonds upon H2O2 treatment. The band shift is promoted by Trx1 knockdown, indicating that mTOR is a Trx1 substrate [6]. Although βHB prevented the H2O2-induced mTOR band shift, this effect was abolished in the presence of Trx1 knockdown (Figure 3B).",56edc541-2bdd-4635-9076-349af5d53867
7,methods8," βHB also normalized H2O2-induced decreases in the phosphorylation of mTOR and its substrates, including S6K and 4EBP1. Again, the effect of βHB was abolished in the presence of Trx1 knockdown (Figure 3C). These results suggest that βHB prevents the oxidation and inactivation of mTOR in response to H2O2 in a Trx1-dependent manner. These results are consistent with the notion that βHB potentiates Trx1 function.  3.4. βHB Prevents H2O2-Induced AMPK Inhibition in a Trx1-Dependent Manner  To further confirm that βHB potentiates Trx1 function, the effect of βHB on AMPK, another Trx1 substrate [7], was examined. As shown previously, AMPKα exhibited band shifts to higher molecular weights in SDS-PAGE analyses under non-reducing conditions following H2O2 treatment. The band shifts were abolished when the SDS-PAGE analyses were conducted in the presence of 2ME (Figure 4A) [7]. These results suggest that AMPKα forms intermolecular disulfide bonds upon H2O2 treatment.",0592e397-575a-45fb-a832-92e853131942
8,methods9," βHB prevented the H2O2-induced AMPKα band shifts, an effect that was abolished in the presence of Trx1 knockdown (Figure 4B). βHB also normalized H2O2-induced decreases in the phosphorylation of ACC, an AMPK substrate [19], but the effect was abolished in the presence of Trx1 knockdown (Figure 4C). These results suggest that βHB maintains AMPK function in a Trx1-dependent manner.  3.5. βHB May Upregulate Trx1 through HDAC Inhibition  We then investigated the mechanism through which βHB upregulates Trx1 in cardiomyocytes. Since βHB inhibits the HDAC activity of class I HDACs [14], βHB may upregulate Trx1 through HDAC inhibition. Consistent with our hypothesis, βHB promoted protein acetylation in a dose-dependent manner. βHB increased HDAC1 protein, which likely represents compensatory feedback regulation. The dose-dependency of the effect of βHB on the induction of protein acetylation (Figure 5A) was similar to that observed in the upregulation of Trx1.",b5950314-89ed-4212-bdb3-359dce411d86
9,methods10," In contrast to βHB, 30 and 100 µM H2O2 did not significantly upregulate HDAC1, whereas 300 µM H2O2 downregulated HDAC1 (Figure 5B). To investigate whether HDAC1 inhibition upregulates Trx1, HDAC1 was knocked down with HDAC1 shRNA in the cardiomyocytes. The knockdown of HDAC1 upregulated Trx1 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5C). To test whether βHB induces Trx1 acetylation, Flag- and HA-tagged Trx1 was overexpressed in cardiomyocytes using an adenovirus vector. Trx1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and then subjected to immunoblot analyses with anti-acetylated lysine antibody and anti-HA antibody. βHB significantly increased acetylated Trx1/total Trx1, indicating that βHB induces Trx1 acetylation (Figure 5D). Since Trx1 upregulation is observed shortly after βHB treatment, βHB may upregulate Trx1 with a posttranslational mechanism. To test this possibility, cardiomyocytes were treated with βHB and cycloheximide (cycloheximide (CHX)), an inhibitor of protein translation.",78e9bf3d-0bd0-496a-88a4-83f5e4f3e4b6
10,methods11," Degradation of the Trx1 protein in cardiomyocytes in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) was significantly retarded in the presence of βHB (Figure 5E), suggesting that βHB may upregulate Trx1 by inhibiting protein degradation.  4. Discussion  4.1. βHB Upregulates Trx1  Ketone bodies have emerged as beneficial nutrients in cardiac pathophysiology. A modest increase in circulating ketone bodies resulting from ketogenic diet consumption mitigates oxidative stress in the heart, as evidenced by decreases in oxidized glutathione, 3-nitrotyrosine, and malondialdehyde levels [20]. The current study shows that βHB at 0.3–3 mM upregulates Trx1 and confers resistance against oxidative stress through Trx1 in cultured cardiomyocytes. βHB potentiated Trx1 function in the presence of oxidative stress, as evidenced by the rescue of oxidation-induced inactivation of mTOR and AMPK, known direct substrates of Trx1.",ab5f4c42-6a7b-4064-b218-22a64aeba0cb
11,methods12," Although the extent to which how Trx1 contributes to biological functions of mTOR and AMPK such as cell growth and fatty acid oxidation needs to be further investigated. Our previous works have shown that Trx1 confers resistance against oxidative stress, partly through mTOR and AMPK [6,7]. Thus, we propose that βHB confers stress resistance to cardiomyocytes, partly through upregulation of the Trx1 system (Figure 6).  4.2. Ketone Bodies in mTOR Regulation  We showed that βHB normalizes the H2O2-induced oxidative inhibition of mTOR via Trx1. mTOR is inhibited by the direct oxidation at Cys1483, whereas Trx1 normalizes mTOR activity via the reduction of Cys1483 [6]. The Trx1-mediated normalization of mTOR may alleviate oxidative stress-induced downregulation of mitochondrial genes [6], which may protect the heart under diabetic conditions. It should be noted that the overall effect of ketone bodies upon mTOR appears to be context dependent.",20439b6b-53f9-47ca-92b6-ec0f3598e8c1
12,methods13," Since mTOR is regulated by multiple mechanisms, βHB may affect the overall activity of mTOR through multiple mechanisms, both positively and negatively. For example, βHB inhibits mTOR activation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by phenylephrine, an agonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor [10]. Phenylephrine-induced mTOR activation is mediated by Erk, and phenylephrine-induced Erk activation is sensitive to antioxidant treatment [21,22]. Thus, it is possible that βHB inhibits phenylephrine-induced mTOR activation through the suppression of Erk, which is facilitated by the maintenance of the redox environment by the Trx1 system.  4.3. Ketone Body in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy  Trx1 tended to be upregulated at 0.1 mM βHB, whereas it was significantly upregulated at 0.3 mM βHB in cardiomyocytes (Figure 1A). The plasma level of βHB is 0.4–0.5 mM in non-diabetic patients at baseline. It is significantly elevated in diabetic patients or in response to fasting in non-diabetic patients.",8202ccca-5cd3-4be7-ad71-4bf1e2f1a1ce
13,methods14," Thus, it is likely that βHB could affect the level of Trx1 in cardiomyocytes under pathophysiologically relevant conditions. Despite the generally salutary effect of ketone bodies in the heart, whether ketone bodies are also beneficial in diabetic cardiomyopathy is not fully understood. Further investigation is needed to demonstrate that modest elevation of the plasma level of βHB protects the heart through the upregulation of Trx1 in vivo. It should be noted, however, that uncontrolled ketone body synthesis during diabetes results in ketoacidosis, where βHB reaches over 3 mM in the blood plasma [23]. We show here that βHB confers resistance against oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes through the upregulation of Trx1. It should be noted, however, that a high dose of βHB (10 mM) was less effective in inducing Trx1 and Prdx1 as well as overall protein acetylation levels than lower doses of βHB (Figure 1A and Figure 5A).",f53ce9f5-52b5-4673-ac93-f24fc9e244e1
14,methods15," Indeed, a high dose of βHB (10 mM) did not significantly confer resistance against oxidative stress (Figure 2C). Taken together, the data indicate that while ketone bodies at physiological concentrations and at the slightly elevated (1–3 mM) concentrations seen in diabetic patients mitigate oxidative stress, they attenuate the ability to promote Trx1 at the high concentrations (>3 mM) seen during ketoacidosis. Although ketone bodies may act as a thrifty substrate and may improve energetics [13], our results suggest that βHB also has an additional effect, namely, to stimulate Trx1, thereby conferring stress resistance to the heart.  4.4. Ketone Bodies, HDAC Inhibtioin and Trx1 as a Longevity Factor  Calorie restriction and fasting promote ketone body synthesis, which potentially mediates the salutary effects of calorie restriction, including lifespan extension. In rats, calorie restriction induces a modest elevation of βHB, approximately 0.7 mM, in blood plasma [24].",ceb01065-c15b-4904-8bb3-3220deb526ba
15,methods16," βHB is a natural inhibitor of class I HDACs such as HDAC1 and HDAC2 [14], and the inhibition of class I HDACs enhances cardiac function and longevity in Drosophila melanogaster [25]. We show here that both βHB and HDAC1 inhibition upregulate Trx1. Interestingly, both a ketogenic diet and systemic Trx1 overexpression have been shown to reduce midlife mortality without affecting maximum lifespan in mice [26,27]. Thus, it will be interesting to investigate whether Trx1 mediates the salutary actions of calorie restriction, ketogenic diet, and HDAC inhibition.  4.5. Mechanism Responsible for Trx1 Upregulation  Our results show that βHB induces Trx1 acetylation and inhibits Trx1 degradation. Besides inhibiting HDACs, βHB may induce protein acetylation via an increase in acetyl-CoA [9]. It has been shown previously that Trx1 is acetylated at several lysine residues, including Lys94 [28], and that Trx1 is ubiquitinated at Lys94.",008fb9c3-4c06-42c5-98f7-d17f5f84e834
16,methods17," These results suggest that Trx1 may be degraded through the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway [29]. Since Lys94 can be either acetylated or ubiquitinated, βHB-induced acetylation at Lys94 may compete with other mechanisms promoting ubiquitination at Lys94, thereby controlling the stability of Trx1. Further investigations are necessary to test this possibility.  4.6. Experimental Limitation  We assessed the activity of mTOR and AMPK to evaluate the oxidoreductase activity of Trx1 in this study. It should be noted, however, that mTOR and AMPK may be only one of the many effects of βHB, and we have not evaluated how βHB affects cellular function through mTOR and AMPK in this study. Thus, further investigation is needed to elucidate how the βHB–Trx1 axis protects the heart against diabetic cardiomyopathy.  5. Conclusions  βHB, a major ketone body in mammals, confers resistance against oxidative stress to cardiomyocytes through Trx1 induction.",17e356b0-3e33-4d0c-8c8a-45a16af43dbf
17,methods18," βHB upregulates Trx1, possibly through class I HDAC inhibition and through the inhibition of Trx1 degradation. ",fabb9c5c-d0bc-4585-b2b6-d7f14ac72823
