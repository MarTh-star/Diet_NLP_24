0,introduction0,"Glioblastoma (Glioblastoma (GBM)) has the highest mortality rate among primary brain tumours in adults and remains largely unmanageable with a life expectancy of about 6–24 months following diagnosis. Despite decades of research, little progress has been made in improving Glioblastoma (GBM) survival1. A defining characteristic of Glioblastoma (GBM) is the secondary structures of Scherer, which includes diffuse parenchymal growth and invasion over the subpial surface, along white matter tracks, and through the Virchow-Robin space2. The highly invasive nature of Glioblastoma (GBM) makes most current therapies ineffective. Most patients die from intracranial pressure due to inflammation, edema, and distal tumour cell invasion. Hence, the proliferative and invasive nature of Glioblastoma (GBM) is the major hindrance for effective therapeutic intervention.",a7d9c8a5-5dad-4fbb-8928-78353595d2b2
1,introduction1,"  Glioblastoma (GBM) contains a range of morphologically diverse neoplastic cell types that express glial, stem cell, and myeloid/mesenchymal markers3–5. Also recognized are abnormalities in the number, structure, and function of mitochondria in Glioblastoma (GBM) tumour tissue6–10. In addition, recent studies show abnormalities in Glioblastoma (GBM) mitochondrial-associated membranes, which are also critical for normal mitochondrial function11. Moreover, the content and composition of cardiolipin, the signature lipid of the mitochondrial inner membrane that regulates oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), shows deviations from the normal in five different murine Glioblastoma (GBM) models12. As mitochondrial function and efficiency is dependent on structure13, OxPhos is expected to be lower in Glioblastoma (GBM) than in normal brain tissue. Indeed, significant evidence shows that OxPhos is defective in human and murine Glioblastoma (GBM)7,12,14.",019b5eb9-dec8-41b4-919d-9816b12f7d1d
2,introduction2,"  Regardless of Glioblastoma (GBM) cell type, glucose and glutamine are required for growth and invasion through glycolysis and glutaminolysis, respectively15–19. Although glucose is the primary metabolic fuel for neurons and glia, normal brain cells can transition to ketone bodies (primarily β-hydroxybutyrate) for energy under hypoglycemic conditions20. In contrast, Glioblastoma (GBM) cells lack metabolic flexibility and are susceptible to death in response to reduced glucose bioavailability21. Although brain glutamine levels are tightly regulated via the glutamine-glutamate cycle, the bioavailability of glutamine increases following surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, which fuels tumour growth20,22. If glucose and/or glutamine remain available, the tumour cells will utilize the fuel and grow, making long-term management difficult.",60d7b999-295b-4c48-aa97-fb76807685a9
3,introduction3,"  The calorically restricted ketogenic diet (KD-R) is a low carbohydrate, high fat diet, that reduces blood glucose and increases blood ketone bodies to therapeutic levels, while simultaneously inducing anti-inflammatory effects23. The primary ketone bodies, β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, are also neuroprotective and non-fermentable24,25. We found previously that the KD-R is a non-toxic anti-inflammatory approach to reduce pathology in experimental human and mouse brain tumours23. The neoplastic Glioblastoma (GBM) cells can also synthesize high-energy phosphates through mitochondrial substrate level phosphorylation supported by glutaminolysis25,26. In addition, glutamine provides a continuous source of nitrogen for de novo synthesis of nucleotides and proteins in cancer cells27. The extent of glucose and glutamine metabolism in tumour cells depends not only on the tumour cell type, but also on the location and microenvironment.",c97a9dd9-3919-46cf-b1ec-582382341b61
4,introduction4,"  Recently, the efficacy of simultaneous inhibition of both glycolysis and glutaminolysis has been demonstrated in experimental cancer models and in a human Glioblastoma (GBM) case report15,28,29. Therapeutic success depends on modifications in dosage, scheduling, and timing in order to enhance efficacy while reducing toxicity6. 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)) is a glutamine antagonist that was initially isolated from a Streptomyces broth in 1956. diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) blocks multiple glutaminases, thus restricting key metabolites needed for glutaminolysis and the synthesis of nucleotides and proteins30. The anti-tumour efficacy of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) was confirmed in different tumour models, and in humans with various cancers28–30.",525a3aa4-bf3e-44a5-b6f2-bafbefc0da93
5,introduction5,"  In the present study, we show a unique therapeutic response from the simultaneous targeting of glucose and glutamine using a KD-R and diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON), respectively, in syngeneic orthotopic mouse models of Glioblastoma (GBM). The VM-M3 Glioblastoma (GBM) tumour arose in the cerebral cortex of a mouse from the VM/Dk inbred strain, which has a high incidence of spontaneous brain tumours relative to other strains. The mesenchymal VM-M3 tumour cells invade distally throughout the brain using the secondary structures of Scherer2. In addition to the VM-M3 tumour, we also evaluated the effects of the KD-R and diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) combination on the growth of the CT-2A brain tumour. The highly angiogenic CT-2A tumour was produced from 20-methancolanthrene in the cerebral cortex of a C57BL/6J mouse, and has several characteristics in common with the neoplastic neural stem cells found in human Glioblastoma (GBM)31,32.",22c43929-c4d5-4256-bf44-110a38796ac7
6,introduction6, Abnormalities in the electron transport chain were found in both tumours12. Our data show that the combination of KD-R and diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) administration cause massive tumour cell death in both of these preclinical Glioblastoma (GBM) mouse models and highlights the importance of targeting glycolysis and glutaminolysis simultaneously for the metabolic management of Glioblastoma (GBM). ,bddb0cd7-aa66-4da9-b954-9c95209439b5
7,methods0,"Mice Mice of the VM/Dk (VM) strain were obtained as a gift from H. Fraser (University of Edinburgh, Scotland). The C57BL/6J (B6) mice were obtained originally from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. All mice used in this study were housed and bred in the Boston College Animal Care Facility using IACUC approved husbandry conditions28. Male and female mice between 8–10 weeks of age were used for all studies. All animal procedures and protocols were in strict accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee at Boston College under assurance number A3905–01.  The VM-M3 and CT-2A murine Glioblastoma (GBM) models The VM-M3 tumour used in this study arose spontaneously in the cerebrum of an adult male mouse of the VM/Dk inbred strain. A cell line was prepared from the VM-M3 tumour37. The VM-M3 tumour manifests all of the invasive characteristics seen in human Glioblastoma (GBM)2.",8a7c1210-0d9a-47b1-96bb-d7af3e5d5ac6
8,methods1, The CT-2A tumour was originally produced from implantation of 20-methylcholanthrene into the cerebral cortex of a C57BL/6J mouse and was broadly classified as a poorly differentiated highly malignant anaplastic astrocytoma and a cell line was produced from this tumour31. Both cell lines are mycoplasma free and we use MycoZap (Lonza) kit to eradicate mycoplasma. More recent studies have classified the CT-2A tumour as a neural stem cell tumour32. The VM-M3 and the CT-2A cell lines were transduced with a lentivirus vector (gift from Miguel Sena-Esteves) containing the firefly luciferase gene under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (VM-M3/Fluc) to produce VM-M3/Fluc and CT-2A/Fluc cell lines37. This transduction allows the cells to be tracked in the brain using bioluminescent imaging.  Tumour implantation Tumour implantation was performed using our standard protocol2. Briefly mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane (5% in oxygen).,10219ab2-6d3f-44f4-81c1-03ad905fea7d
9,methods2," The tops of the heads were disinfected with ethanol and a small incision was made in the scalp over the midline. A 3 mm3 burr hole was made in the skull over the right parietal region behind the coronal suture and lateral to the sagittal suture. Small (1 mm3) tumour fragments were implanted approximately 1.5–2.0 mm deep into the cortical region using a trocar, as previously described. The skin flaps were closed with 7 mm reflex clips. The mice were placed in a warm room (24 °C) until they were fully recovered. The procedure confirms 100% recovery within a few hours of implantation. The Glioblastoma (GBM) tumour cells are highly invasive regardless of implantation method, and all tumour-implanted mice reach morbidity at approximately 12–15 days.  Dietary/drug regimens and body weight All mice received the standard diet unrestricted (SD-UR) prior to initiation of the study. Tumour fragments were implanted on day zero.",21c33a2c-1c5f-4d30-81d6-a844bfc3aa72
10,methods3," Upon implantation of the tumour, mice remained on the SD-UR until a 15-h fast was initiated 72 h after implantation. Following the fast, mice were introduced to the Ketogenic diet restricted (KD-R), or remained on the SD-UR, depending on the study group. The KD-R has a caloric density of 7.12 Kcal/g. The percent nutritional breakdown of KetoGEN (Medica Nutrition, Canada) is as follows: 2.1% of Cal from carbohydrates, 8.7% of Cal from protein, and 89.2% of Cal from fat (Supplementary Table 1). The Medica Nutrition cancer ketogenic diet that we used was prepared without added vitamins and minerals. Previous studies by Tannanbaum showed that the therapeutic effects of calorie-restricted diets come largely from the restriction of macronutrients and not from restriction of micronutrients70. Mice were individually housed beginning at the initiation of the 15 h fast.",0a6a43d6-b6f8-4dc0-b174-b80d4458e866
11,methods4," Food intake for the KD-R mice was measured to be between 1–3 g per day to maintain a 15–18% body weight reduction in each mouse. Mice were weighed daily to ensure weight maintenance (Supplementary Fig. 4).  Mice receiving the SD-UR were given the standard chow diet (Lab Diet) ad libitum for the duration of the study. For those mice that received diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) injections, a fresh stock was prepared and diluted to an appropriate concentration in PBS and was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). The diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) stock solution in PBS was stored at −20 °C for the duration of the study and mice received 200 μl injections of 0.1–1.0 mg/kg. Mice in the diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) survival study received diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) at a dosage that was appropriate for the individual mouse response. Some doses were skipped if the mice appeared lethargic or if body weight loss exceeded 1.5 g from the previous day.",22cc196b-7657-4290-8bcc-606c8cffcccc
12,methods5," Studies were terminated at the time of morbidity for the control SD-UR group.  Bioluminescence imaging The Xenogen IVIS system is used to record the bioluminescent signal from the labeled tumours as we previously described37. Briefly, for in vivo imaging, mice received an i.p. injection of d-lucifierin (50 mg/kg) in PBS and Isofluorane (5% in oxygen). Imaging times ranged from 1 to 5 min, depending on the time point. For ex vivo imaging, brains were removed and imaged in 0.3 mg d-luciferin in PBS. The IVIS Lumina cooled CCD camera system was used for light acquisition. Data acquisition and analysis was performed with Living Image software (Caliper LS).  Histology Brain tumour samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma) and embedded in paraffin.",9a87b883-b49f-42a0-81f5-137320fda71a
13,methods6," The brain tumour samples were sectioned at 5 μm, were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) at the Harvard University Rodent Histopathology Core Facility (Boston, MA), and were examined by light microscopy using either a Zeiss Axioplan 2 or Nikon SMZ1500 light microscope. Images were acquired using SPOT Imaging Solutions (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) cameras and software. All histological sections were evaluated at the Harvard University Rodent Histopathology Core Facility.  Immunohistochemistry: Ki-67 and Iba-1 For immunohistochemistry, the tissue sections from untreated and treated tumour-bearing mice were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and washed. The tissue sections were then heat treated (95 °C) in antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min.",75362920-9d60-4677-94d1-25454ddd5000
14,methods7," Tissue sections were blocked in goat serum (1:10 in PBS) for one hour at room temperature, treated with Ki-67 primary antibody (rat monoclonal, Dako, 1:100) overnight at 4 °C followed by Alexafluor conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody at 1:100 dilution. Nuclei were stained using NucBlue (Invitrogen). Images were captured by the EVOS FL Cell Imaging System fluorescent microscope. For Iba-1, tissue sections were blocked with Iba-1 primary antibody (rabbit monoclonal, abcam, 1:1000) overnight at 4 °C followed by biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary at 1:2000 dilution. Avidin-biotin reaction was complete by incubating the tissues in ABC reagent (Vector Lab) for 30 min followed by DAB substrate reaction. Methyl green was used for staining the nucleus.  Western blot analysis of Iba-1 protein expression Frozen tumour and normal brain tissues were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl,1 mmol/L Na2EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.",96b14856-2f87-4e15-8efb-4b310ba98630

Lysates were transferred to 1.7 mL Eppendorf tubes, mixed on a rocker for 1 h at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 8100xg for 20 min. Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were estimated using the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay.  Approximately 100 μg of total protein from each tissue sample was denatured with SDS-PAGE sample buffer [63 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.0025% bromphenol blue, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol] and was resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride immobilon TM-P membrane (Millipore) overnight at 4 °C and blocked in either 5% nonfat powdered milk or 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS with Tween 20 (pH 7.6) for 1–3 h at room temperature.",30046b86-472f-4dce-9bff-eba6f6dd2759
16,methods9," Membranes were probed with primary antibodies (Iba-1, abcam, UK) overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The blots were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (anti-rabbit) for 1 h at room temperature and bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Each membrane was stripped and reprobed for β-actin as an internal loading control and the ratio of the Iba-1 to β-actin was analyzed by scanning densitometry (FluorChem 8900 Software).  Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) Two independent LC-MS instruments and procedures were used to measure the amount of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) in the blood and in the VM-M3 tumour tissues. This was done to validate the accuracy of the procedures. A Triple quad method (Agilent 6460) was used to analyze diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) in the first procedure (Fig. 4a).

Blood samples were collected before removal of the brain. 3 N HCl + n-butanol (250 μl) was added to 50 μl of plasma, vortexed and then centrifuged at 16,000xg for 5 min to precipitate proteins. A 200 μl aliquot of the supernatant was transferred to a 1.5 ml tube and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min in a shaking water bath to perform the diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) derivatization reaction. For the brain tissue, 5 μl of n-butanol containing 3 N HCl was added per milligram tissue. The tissue sample was then homogenized with a glass pestle and was then vortexed and centrifuged, and prepared similarly to the plasma samples. Standard solutions were prepared by serial dilution to generate concentrations from 10 to 100 μM. diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) was added to untreated mouse plasma or brain tissue to generate an internal standard curve.",81918b7f-7fda-40d2-a6a3-b4e7af46f235
18,methods11," A high resolution LC-MS QToF method (Agilent 6550) was used to analyze diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) in the second procedure (Fig. 4b). Mice were injected with diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) as above. Pre-weighed frozen brain tissue was transferred to a tube containing ceramic beads (Omni tubes). 3M HCl + butanol was added at a concentration of 5 μl/mg of tissue. The sample was then homogenized via a bead ruptor homogenizer for 45 s, let rest for 30 s, and homogenized again with the bead ruptor for an additional 45 s. Subsequently, the homogenate was derivatized by incubating at 60 °C for 30 min. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 16,000xg for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1.5 ml tube and was centrifuged again to remove excess debris. A 200 μL aliquot of the supernatant was dried in a centrifugal evaporator. The samples were resuspended in 50 μl dH2O containing 0.2% formic acid.",4bfb3940-c69d-4689-829e-37d28093415b

Standard curves were also used as described above.  Blood glucose and ketone measurements All mice were fasted for 2 h before blood collection to stabilize blood glucose levels. Blood glucose and ketone levels were measured using the Keto-Mojo monitoring system (keto-mojo, Napa, California). Whole blood from the tail was placed onto the glucose or ketone strip. The keto-mojo meter was used to determine the mmol levels of glucose and β-hydroxybutyrate in the blood. The Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) was determined as we previously described36.  Tumour necrosis factor determination VM-M3 brain tumour tissue and normal brain tissue from the VM/Dk mice were homogenized and processed following the Quantikine Mouse Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α Immunoassay protocol (R&D systems).",59c57857-1116-4603-a037-13fb239b9054

22,results0,"The aim of this research was to determine if the simultaneous targeting of glucose and glutamine, while under therapeutic ketosis, could manage late-stage growth and enhance survival without toxicity in two different syngeneic mouse models of Glioblastoma (GBM). We administered diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) 7 days after tumour implantation, which is considered late for the VM-M3/Fluc tumour, as neurological signs and symptoms first appear at 10 to 12 days post implantation with morbidity occurring in 100% of the tumour-bearing mice by 14–18 days2. Additional results were obtained in C57BL/6J inbred mice bearing the syngeneic CT-2A high-grade stem cell glioma32. diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON), at the concentrations used in this study, had no toxic effects in non-tumour-bearing VM/Dk mice, as was shown previously for C57BL/6J mice33.  To observe the effect of the KD-R and diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) on the VM-M3 tumour model, we conducted three consecutive experiments.",36931f7e-05c2-4a95-95c8-f7b08d8e69e9
23,results1," Experiment 1 included four groups (SD-UR, SD-UR + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON), KDR, KDR + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)) with lower diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) dosages (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg). Experiment 2 involved both in vivo and ex vivo imaging of two study groups (KD-R and KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)) following the administration of a higher dose of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) (1.0 mg/kg). Experiment 3, a survival study, also used the higher diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) dose (1.0 mg/kg) and included the four groups from Experiment 1 (SD-UR, SD-UR + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON), KDR, KDR + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)) (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Restricted ketogenic diet with diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) reduces progression and mortality of the VM-M3 Glioblastoma (GBM).

24,results2," The implanted mice were divided into two groups on day 4 and were fed either a standard chow diet unrestricted or ad libitum (SD-UR), or a ketogenic diet (KD-R) in restricted amounts to reduce body weight by about 15%. diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) (0.1–1.0 mg/kg) was injected i.p. 7 days following orthotopic tumour implantation. The diet feeding was continued and diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) was injected every day or every alternate day as shown in (a). All mice were imaged in vivo and terminated on day 14 or 15 when all control mice appeared moribund (experiments 1, 2). For experiment 1, bioluminescence was scored from 0–4, following the administration of lower doses of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg). Values are expressed as the mean ± SEM and a one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post hoc test was performed to determine the significance between groups (b).",8f519fb5-9e5f-4d19-a861-1a79cf2de9ad
25,results3," In experiment 2, in vivo bioluminescent photon values were obtained following the administration of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) (1.0 mg/kg) in mice under the KD-R (c). The average in vivo bioluminescent photon values were calculated for the KD-R (n = 4 mice) and KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) (n = 8 mice) in experiment 2.

26,results4," Source data are provided as  Supplementary Data 1    KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) reduces VM-M3 burden and increases survival The KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) treatment was performed as outlined in the study timeline (Fig. 1a). In experiment 1, two doses of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) were used in both the SD-UR and KD-R groups (Fig. 1b). d-luciferin was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) 15 days after tumour implantation, and in vivo bioluminescence imaging was performed. The total VM-M3 tumour bioluminescence photon values were scored from 0 to 4, with 0 being the baseline value and 4 being the highest value. Several mice from the SD-UR group that did not receive diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) had a maximum photon score of 4, whereas the mice from the KD-R group + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) had a minimum photon score of 0 or 1.",adaf0250-df99-4016-aa0a-aa578d2c1980
27,results5," Compared to the control SD-UR group, mice receiving the KD-R alone or SD-UR + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) had a 19 and 44% lower photon value, respectively (Fig. 1b). The bioluminescence photon score was 75% lower in mice that received the KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) than in mice receiving each therapy alone, indicating a synergistic effect of the diet/drug combination.  Experiment 2 involved a larger number of mice (n = 8 mice) that were treated with a higher dose of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) (1.0 mg/kg). Due to the observed synergy between the KD-R and diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) in experiment 1, only the KD-R group was selected for further experiments. All mice in this experiment expressed tumour burden by day 7. Individual brain bioluminescent values are shown in Fig. 1c.",9b26fd29-12db-40ea-901a-262a74bc1b18
28,results6," A baseline value of bioluminescence was seen in 7 out of the 8 KD-R fed mice that received diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) and a reduction in average photon value was observed in the diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)-treated mice (Fig. 1d). A representative number of mice from both study groups are shown in Fig. 1e. All untreated SD-UR control mice died between day 15 and 18. In contrast, mice treated with the diet/drug combination survived until day 40 and onwards (Fig. 1f).  A standard diet restricted (SD-R) group or a ketogenic diet unrestricted (KD-UR) group were not included in this study. We previously showed that a KD-R is more effective at reaching the target level of blood glucose and ketones than is a SD-R23,34,35. In other words, the ketone levels are higher and the glucose levels are lower under KD-R feeding than under SD-R feeding despite similar caloric restriction and reduced body weight.",bb4ab3cd-03ad-4d78-bda7-f36c81e2b02c
29,results7," A KD-UR was also not included in this study, as consumption of ketogenic diets in unrestricted amounts can cause insulin insensitivity and weight gain, as we previously described23,35,36.  KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) reduces ex vivo bioluminescence in VM-M3 brain The VM mice from experiment 2 were sacrificed after in vivo imaging, and their brains were immediately resected and individually imaged ex vivo for total bioluminescence as described in the Methods. Ex vivo imaging provides a more accurate assessment of tumour progression than in vivo brain imaging due to the direct contact of the d-luciferin with the brain tissue and the removal of the blood–brain barrier as a limiting factor. The individual ex vivo bioluminescent values for the diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)-treated mice were below the baseline value indicating a reduction in tumour cell viability (Fig. 2a). These values were consistent with the in vivo photon values (Fig. 1c).",f6a2aed1-daee-42fa-be73-5200dfc963c0

A representative number of brains from the KD-R and the diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)-treated mice are shown in comparison to the SD-UR mice (Fig. 2c). It should be noted that an accurate in vivo bioluminescent value was not obtained for mouse #3 and #6 due to several variables during the imaging process (tumour burden, isoflurane exposure, blood collection, etc.). If an individual mouse did not provide an accurate in vivo bioluminescent reading, the brain was immediately resected, placed in sterile PBS and imaged ex vivo. For this reason, there are slight discrepancies in the number of mice imaged for in vivo bioluminescence and for ex vivo bioluminescence in experiment 2.Fig. 2 Restricted ketogenic diet with diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) reduces VM-M3 Glioblastoma (GBM) bioluminescence.",a6fde7fa-5735-4c86-94e9-1bfe1c30d1d5

The KD-R reduced the invasion of VM-M3 cells as shown in both H&E and Ki-67 staining (Figs. 3b, c). VM-M3 Glioblastoma (GBM) tumour cells were seen invading the perivascular area in the SD-UR brain, whereas fewer invading Glioblastoma (GBM) tumour cells were seen in the KD-R brains. No invading VM-M3 cells were seen in the KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)-treated brains (Fig. 3c). These findings indicate that the diet/drug therapy both kills tumour cells and inhibits invasion.

The Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) values for the KD-R mice, treated and untreated with diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON), were lower than for SD-UR mice. The Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) values in the KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) mice were similar to that in the KD-R mice, indicating that a low Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) was maintained under diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) treatment (Fig. 5b).

There was a reduction in Iba-1 expression in diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)-treated brain tumour tissue.

This finding is consistent with the histological observation found from our H&E analysis (Fig. 3). The reduced Iba-1 staining is also consistent with the reduced Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression (Fig. 5), suggesting reduced inflammation in the brains of both KD-R and diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)-treated mice.

However, we showed that the KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) could rescue mice with these Glioblastoma (GBM) tumours from late-stage orthotopic growth. The diet/drug therapy reduced brain swelling, hemorrhage, and morbidity. The KD-R alone reduced the VM-M3/Fluc cell invasion and proliferation as seen by both in vivo and ex vivo bioluminescent imaging of the brains, with Ki-67 staining, and with histology of the brain tissues. Moreover, the KD-R produced therapeutic ketosis (low Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) value) and reduced Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and Iba-1 levels, suggesting reduced inflammation as compared to the SD-UR control brains.",bde5777c-2347-42f0-b606-c11219374224
48,discussion1," The ability of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) treatment to arrest tumour growth and promote survival late in disease progression suggests a potentially direct role for glutamine metabolism in VM-M3/Fluc growth and invasion. This finding is consistent with the importance of glutamine in the metabolism of mesenchymal cells from which the VM-M3 tumour is derived4,37,42. Although diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) treatment alone was effective in reducing tumour growth and invasion in the control SD-UR mice, a synergistic effect was observed when diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) was administered together with the KD-R, providing evidence for a diet/drug interaction. The findings also support the press-pulse therapeutic strategy for the metabolic management of cancer with the KD-R serving as a press therapy and diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) serving as a pulse therapy6.",96b120ce-8c27-43df-82a4-b46e49f4722a
49,discussion2,"  Interestingly, the level of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) in the brain tumour tissue was higher under KD-R feeding than under SD-UR feeding suggesting that the KD-R facilitates diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) delivery to the brain. This is significant because it allowed for a lower therapeutic dose of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) when administered under a KD-R regimen. A similar observation was made previously in showing that a KD-R facilitated the delivery of the iminosugar, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, across the blood–brain barrier in mice with Sandhoff disease43. Although the mechanism remains to be determined, these findings suggest that the KD has potential as a facilitator of drug delivery to the brain for a broad range of neuro-pathological conditions.",6297d533-d687-4905-a2a7-4ec4bd28dfc8
50,discussion3," It is also important to mention that our previous findings clearly demonstrated that caloric restriction can maintain the blood vessel integrity in the mouse CT-2A and the human U-87 Glioblastoma (GBM) and thus reduce the leakiness of the neovasculature44. Interestingly, a recent observation by Gordon et al. showed that diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) treatment promotes the recovery of blood–brain barrier integrity in the mouse model of cerebral malaria33. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism by which a KD-R facilitates drug delivery to the brain.  diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) has shown therapeutic efficacy in human cancers of the blood, colon, and lung, but issues of toxicity were noted in some cases30. No noticeable toxicity was seen in the diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)-treated mice until the end of the study when mild muscle loss was observed in some of the mice.",089a281d-ecaa-42d8-85a6-16553cbb18dc
51,discussion4," It is proposed that issues with diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) toxicity arise when there is an appreciable competition for glutamine between host and tumour. There is also increasing evidence supporting the protective role of glutamine supplementation for cancer patients45. Since tumour consumption of glutamine is dissipative, glutamine supplementation might not increase tumour growth46. However, additional preclinical studies will be needed to determine if glutamine supplementation could be used together with diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON). It is our view that strategies for managing toxicity of a therapeutically effective drug would be as important as developing a new drug. Our results indicate that the KD-R enhances the therapeutic action of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON), thus reducing dosage and toxicity.  The therapeutic action of the diet/drug effect seen in the VM-M3 tumour was also seen in the CT-2A neural stem cell tumour.",20fa2fa7-c662-4c58-b6b4-e9ef0323fe02
52,discussion5," As observed from histological analysis, the KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) treatment caused massive mitotic arrest or catastrophe in the CT-2A brain tumour cells. The results show that therapeutic efficacy against orthotopic brain tumour growth was greater using the diet/drug combination than in using either the KD-R or diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) alone. The CT-2A tumour shares several characteristics with glioma stem cells32, whereas the VM-M3 tumour shares several characteristics with the invasive mesenchymal cell found in most Glioblastoma (GBM)2. Hence, our findings suggest that the KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) therapeutic strategy could potentially target the two most common neoplastic cell types found in human Glioblastoma (GBM)3. Our recent human Glioblastoma (GBM) case report provides support for our prediction15.  Several mechanisms could underlie the therapeutic action of the diet/drug therapy used to treat the VM-M3 and CT-2A tumours.",739ab655-3177-4673-a969-5ae9fff777e2
53,discussion6," The KD-R will simultaneously target the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways, which are upregulated in Glioblastoma (GBM)47–49. We previously showed that calorie restriction and restricted ketogenic diets target the IGF-1, PI3K, AKT, and Hif-1α signaling pathways in the CT-2A tumour38,50. The down-regulation of these pathways would reduce angiogenesis, inflammation, and mTOR signaling, while enhancing tumour cell apoptosis23,44,51,52. As glucose is the fuel for glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and serine biosynthesis, the KD-R should reduce multiple growth metabolites, tumour cell glutathione levels, and nucleotide synthesis. Furthermore, the KD-R should also reduce one-carbon metabolism especially in glioma cells lacking OxPhos capacity25,49,53. Hence, the glucose-restricting action of the KD-R will target multiple signaling pathways linked to glioma growth and progression.",c81033c0-c50a-491c-bbdc-ee8cefc9f021
54,discussion7,"  In addition to restricting glucose availability, the KD-R will also elevate β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, the major circulating ketone bodies produced in the liver, from the active metabolism of medium chain triglycerides54. Ketone bodies increase the redox span of the CoQ couple, thus reducing oxidative stress in normal brain cells54. These ketone bodies are also neuroprotective and have beneficial therapeutic value for various diseases24,55. As ketone bodies are non-fermentable and require efficient OxPhos for generating ATP25,54, the VM-M3 and CT-2A cells will be unable to metabolize these metabolites for energy due to insufficient OxPhos12,25. Ketone bodies cannot be used as an alternative energy fuel in cells with defective mitochondria12,25. Previous studies demonstrated that glioma cells cannot use ketone bodies and that ketone bodies do not stimulate tumour growth56,57.",a60c1e6c-e4be-47e2-906e-95f27052191b
55,discussion8," Hence, the KD-R has a dual function in (1) targeting glucose-dependent signaling pathways that drive tumour growth, and (2) in providing an alternative metabolic fuel to normal brain cells under glucose restriction.  While the KD-R will reduce metabolites through glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) will block glutaminolysis, thus depriving the tumour cells of the amide nitrogen needed for nucleotide and protein synthesis, and at the same time, will deplete the glutamate needed for synthesis of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)25,58,59. α-KG is a precursor for lipid synthesis through reductive carboxylation and is the substrate for ATP synthesis through the succinate-CoA ligase reaction in the TCA cycle under hypoxia25,60. As mentioned previously, however, glutamine targeting is more challenging than is glucose targeting due to the importance of glutamine for the immune system and the gut6,61.",d59f43a1-7f02-43f7-bf22-c63a7a0eb689
56,discussion9," Consequently, glutamine targeting must be done strategically to avoid damage to those systems that are needed for normal physiological function6,15. It is for this reason that we administered diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) to the tumour-bearing mice at low doses and transiently. We administered diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) 7 days after tumour implantation, which is considered late for the VM-M3/Fluc tumour because neurological signs and symptoms start to appear 10–12 days post implantation followed by 100% death in 14–18 days. The late administration of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) was chosen to ensure adequately high ketone levels were achieved in order to facilitate neuroprotection and to reduce tumour inflammation. Secondly, the late treatment could serve as a comparable model when treating late-stage Glioblastoma (GBM) patients. A 60–70% reduction in tumour growth was observed when diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) was administered at 0.5 mg/kg once or twice per week.",f846872e-457e-40aa-8c66-ab1b1879492b
57,discussion10," In comparison, a near complete resolution of the brain tumour was achieved when 1.0 mg/kg of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) was administered with the same schedule, as seen with bioluminescent imaging. These results are significant because no other clinical or pre-clinical study using diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) considered a KD-R as a method for protecting the host from toxicity. Case reports of Glioblastoma (GBM) and other metastatic cancers show the significance of the KD-R when combined with other therapies15,62,63.  Our findings support previous suggestions that reduced glutaminolysis would be a key therapeutic action of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) against the growth of glutamine-dependent tumours, including Glioblastoma (GBM)29,30.",88e9a045-ed16-4330-b674-28706ae04a5c
58,discussion11," Although it is known that diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) targets glutaminolysis in tissues30,33,58 and that reduced levels of circulating glucose will reduce glycolysis64,65, we were unable to find consistent brain metabolite changes in pathways of glycolysis and glutaminolysis in a preliminary metabolomic analysis of KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)-treated VM-M3 mouse brains. Due to the confounding variables in the in vivo environment (dead tumour cells, necrotic tissue, and various types of host infiltrating cells), we believe that an in vitro analysis in defined media could provide a clearer picture of the changes in metabolites of the glucose and glutamine pathways due to diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) or other drug treatments in the VM-M3 and CT-2A cells. It will also be important to determine if other glutaminolysis inhibitors, e.g.",e4ebd0e2-a2c4-4a3f-8e16-92199f818524
59,discussion12,", epigallocatechin-3-gallate (epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG)), bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl) ethyl sulfide (BPTEs), and CB-83919,66, can match the therapeutic action of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) against brain cancer when used together with the KD-R. Pretreatment with a ketogenic diet before implementing the standard of care is suggested in order to protect normal brain cells from treatment toxicities22.  It is important to mention that our findings in the VM-M3 and CT-2A syngeneic Glioblastoma (GBM) models might be considered contradictory to some previous studies in Glioblastoma (GBM) patients and in experimental systems67–69. Previous studies from Bachoo and colleagues suggest minimal 13C-glutamine anaplerosis in Glioblastoma (GBM) implying that glutamine restriction in this context may not be therapeutic68.",6b61216b-fcfb-47a5-97a9-1ea94d0b0b8f
60,discussion13," As diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) inhibits multiple glutaminases, it is possible that diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) does not directly impact glutamine anaplerosis in vivo, but acts on other related pathways and systems29,30,33. We recently described how glutamine is the only amino acid not requiring an energy investment to generate ATP through mitochondria substrate level phosphorylation (msubstrate level phosphorylation (SLP))25. Tardito et al. found that under glutamine starvation, intracellular oleate was unaffected, and glucose-dependent glutamate production increased, implying that the contribution of glutamine to growth is largely independent of anaplerosis69. Further, Oizel et al. identified two clusters of Glioblastoma (GBM) that are glutaminehigh and glutaminelow based on glutamine utilization16. These investigators also mentioned that the most aggressive Glioblastoma (GBM) contained mesenchymal cells that utilized the highest levels of glutamine.",ef7bb1d6-ee65-49ea-99b0-4124c5084497
61,discussion14," The VM-M3 cells are highly invasive and of mesenchymal origin2,37. Nevertheless, we use caution in the interpretation of our data, as the metabolic effects of diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON)’s action in killing the Glioblastoma (GBM) cells were inferred rather than measured directly.  In the present study, we demonstrate the benefits of targeting glutamine under a KD-R for managing experimental Glioblastoma (GBM). The influence of targeting both glucose and glutamine on the metabolic pathways involved with Glioblastoma (GBM) growth is shown in Fig. 8. This treatment was capable of arresting the growth of tumour cells and in promoting the survival of mice with two different syngeneic Glioblastoma (GBM) tumours grown orthotopically. As the mice used for these studies were not treated with surgery, radiation, or standard chemotherapy, it is unclear if a similar therapeutic response would be seen in Glioblastoma (GBM) patients using this approach together with current standard of care15.",4235bb94-5fb4-45be-8c22-985fcd56b3e6
62,discussion15," Because of the high mortality following a Glioblastoma (GBM) diagnosis, our findings should have clinical implications especially in light of our recent case report15. Furthermore, our studies reveal a potential role for the ketogenic diet in facilitating drug delivery to brain tumours.Fig. 8 Targeting glucose and glutamine using KD-R with diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) for the Metabolic Management of the VM-M3 and CT-2A Experimental Glioblastoma (GBM). Glioblastoma (GBM) tumour cells are largely dependent on glucose and glutamine for survival and growth. Energy through substrate level phosphorylation (substrate level phosphorylation (SLP)) in the cytoplasm (glycolysis) and in the TCA cycle (glutaminolysis) will compensate for reduced energy through oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) or hypoxia that occurs in these Glioblastoma (GBM) cells.",ba18243e-d315-446b-950b-8fe5945b2483
63,discussion16," The KD-R will reduce glucose carbons for both the glycolytic and pentose phosphate (PPP) pathways that supply ATP and precursors for lipid and nucleotide synthesis, as well as for glutathione production. diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) will inhibit glutaminases thus depleting glutamate and the glutamine-derived amide nitrogen for ammonia and nucleotide synthesis. Depletion of glutamine-derived glutamate will reduce anapleurotic carbons to the TCA cycle through α-KG for protein synthesis, while also reducing ATP synthesis at the succinyl CoA synthase step in the TCA cycle. The glutamine-derived glutamate is also used for glutathione production that protects tumor cells from oxidative stress. The KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) will thus make the VM-M3 and the CT-2A cells vulnerable to oxidative stress.",411ab109-a8bf-428c-9708-e391b12ee162
64,discussion17," The simultaneous targeting of glucose and glutamine using the KD-R + diazo 5 oxo L norleucine (DON) will starve tumour cells of energy production while blocking their ability to synthesize proteins, lipids, and nucleotides. This metabolic starvation could also reduce extracellular acidification through reduction of lactate and succinate. The elevation of non-fermentable ketone bodies will provide normal cells with an alternative energy source to glucose while also protecting them from oxidative stress.
