0,methods0,"This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines laid down in the International Cooperation on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medical Products GL9 Good Clinical Practices (Good Clinical Practices (GCP)) and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (EMEA)). The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics and Welfare Group (Ethics and Welfare Group (EWG)) (URN 2011 1132). The 6-month, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over, novel medium-chain TAG diet trial study for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy has previously been reported(  7  ). Briefly, the study population consisted of twenty-one dogs of seventeen different breeds detailed in the online Supplementary Table S1.",cd8e93e9-cbc3-4244-b8b6-0d1fce11e0a8
1,methods1," The study population consisted of fifteen males, of which ten were neutered and five were intact, and six females, of which four were neutered and two were intact (online Supplementary Table S1). The dogs had a mean age of 4·59 (sd 1·73) years and weighed a mean of 29·79 (sd 14·73) kg at the start of the trial (online Supplementary Table S1). The experimental placebo and medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D) formulas were dry extruded kibble (Nestle Purina PetCare) formulated to contain <10 % moisture, at least 28 % crude protein, at least 15 % crude fat and 50 % carbohydrates, with <2 % as crude fibre(  7  ). The only composition difference is that zero medium chain TAG (MCT) were added to the placebo formula, and lard was used as fat substitute to ensure that the formulas were isoenergetic (1561 kJ/100 g (373 kcal)/100 g), whereas the test formula contained 5·5 % medium chain TAG (MCT).",d9f67e7f-e9b8-44a1-ba6e-8fc20bf8c1a7
2,methods2," medium chain TAG (MCT) content was about 10 % of total formula calories (based on fat as 35·5 kJ (8·5 kcal)/g and medium chain TAG (MCT) as 28·4 kJ/100 g (6·8 kcal)/g). Proximate analysis of both formulas indicated that they were of similar composition, with the exception of medium chain TAG (MCT), as the placebo diet was void of C12, C10 and C8 FA (each <0·100 % of placebo formula). In this study, canine serum samples were analysed using an untargeted UPLC-MS metabolic profiling approach. The reversed-phase (RP) chromatography facilitated the separation of non-polar /moderately polar molecules, whereas the LP chromatography facilitated the separation of lipids(  24  ,  25  ).  Serum sample collection and preparation Blood samples were collected from the dogs over the duration of the study at visit two on day 90 (sd 2) d and at visit three on day 180 (sd 2) d, corresponding to either placebo diet phase or medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D) phase samples.",803ae29e-b7e6-454e-ad49-da681b32f06a
3,methods3," This study consisted of a cross-over placebo controlled diet trial design where the first diet initiated, either placebo or medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D), was randomised. Blood was collected after overnight fasting before consumption of respective diets and routine concomitant antiepileptic drugs (antiepileptic drugs (AED)) the next day. Fasted samples were used in this study in order to interrogate the global shifts in metabolism rather than immediate/short-term changes associated with diet consumption. Further information regarding the collection of canine serum samples can be found in the online Supplementary Table S2. Canine serum was combined with pre-chilled methanol to facilitate protein precipitation. Proteins were removed by centrifugation where the supernatants were subsequently dried by centrifugal evaporation. Dried metabolite extracts were re-suspended in UPLC-grade water for RP chromatography and in methanol–water (1:1) for LP chromatography.",f540a156-8f10-48e2-9115-8434f2e0af79
4,methods4," Pooled quality control (QC) samples were made using 10 μl of each study sample(  26  ). Further information regarding the preparation of canine serum samples can be found in the online Supplementary Table S2.  Canine serum ultra-performance liquid chromatography-MS data acquisition and extraction Ultra-performance liquid chromatography separation was performed using an Acquity UPLC system (Waters Corporation). A high strength silica column was used for RP liquid chromatography and a charged surface hybrid column was used for LP liquid chromatography (online Supplementary Table S3). MS was carried out on a Xevo G2-S Q-TOF (Waters MS technologies) mass spectrometer for RP experiments and on a Q-TOF Premier (Waters MS technologies) mass spectrometer for LP experiments (online Supplementary Table S4). Data extraction was performed by peak picking and grouping using the XCMS package in R programming language (open-source software R, version 3.3.2) (online Supplementary Table S5).",adbd8207-a4c5-4675-b2e9-f9ac66ac8a61
5,methods5," A QC filtering protocol was used in all UPLC-MS analyses(  26  ). Briefly, pooled QC samples were injected ten times before UPLC-MS analysis of study samples to facilitate the conditioning of the chromatographic column. QC samples were subsequently injected approximately once every ten study samples analysed and at the end of the study. A CV of ≥30 % within QC for all extracted metabolite features formed the major criteria for removal of metabolite features that were considered unreliable. Furthermore, metabolite features that were not present in (QCn-1) QC samples were also considered unreliable and removed from further data analysis. The resultant metabolite features list, classified as reliable metabolic features passing the QC filtering protocols, was normalised by median fold change using an in-house normalisation script executed in the R programming language (open source software, R, version 3.3.2).

6,analysis0,"Patterson et al.(  27  ) performed power calculations using the results that were acquired from their study, which showed that twenty-two dogs in each group would be sufficient to show significant differences between diet groups using seizure frequency as the major outcome variable. We report only twenty-one dogs, as one dog was excluded owing to an error in the diet dispensed, which came to our notice only during data analysis after completion of the study(  7  ). Statistical analysis of canine serum data included paired Student’s t test analysis with Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) false discovery rate (false discovery rate (FDR)) multiple t test P value correction comparing metabolite intensities between diet groups(  28  ). An false discovery rate (FDR) multiple test correction method is commonly applied in metabolomic studies owing to the large number of metabolite features that are detected and analysed simultaneously.",82179d1f-1734-4287-b81a-9b255eaa3b5c
7,analysis1," The BH critical value was calculated by (i/m)Q, where i is the relative rank of a P-value generated from a single t test, m is the total number of statistical tests calculated and Q is the pre-determined false discovery rate (FDR) (Q=0·05). The largest statistical test P value result that is P<(i/m)Q is considered significant, with all subsequent P-values that are smaller also considered significant and adjusted accordingly(  28  ). Significant metabolite features (P<0·05) were identified by UPLC-tandem MS (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis. Subsequent UPLC-MS/MS verification required a m/z (mass-to-charge) match of ±0·01 m/z and a retention time match of ±0·5 min to the original UPLC-MS-detected metabolite feature to be considered reliable. Metabolite identification was facilitated by mass spectra fragmentation patterns and matching m/z ratio to metabolites found in online databases, including LIPID MAPS (http://www.lipidmaps.org), HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/), METLIN (https://metlin.scripps.",9601a8af-6cfe-44cd-99e0-1b7bac2d3a12
8,analysis2,edu/index.php) and other published literature(  29  ). Relative metabolite abundance fold change was calculated on the basis of the average fold changes for individual paired samples and was relative to the lower-abundance diet phase group. ,3d97e7e2-901b-430a-9b09-f195f4b51cb8
9,results0,"Consumption of the medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D) resulted in significant changes to the fasted canine serum metabolic profiles when compared with the standardised placebo diet, which contained zero medium chain TAG (MCT). In all, sixteen metabolites, detected using UPLC-MS/MS techniques, were altered with statistical significance between placebo diet and medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D) phases (Table 1). All metabolites were identified based on UPLC-MS/MS fragmentation experiments and belong to the classes of compounds known as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and acylcarnitine metabolites; examples of these metabolites can be found in the online Supplementary Fig. S1. Palmitoylcarnitine (C16 : 0), octadecenoylcarnitine (C18 : 1), stearoylcarnitine (C18 : 0), LysoPC(18 : 2), LysoPC (18 : 3), PC (16 : 0/18 : 2), PC (16 : 0/18:1) and PC (18 : 0/18 : 2) were shown to be higher in abundance during the placebo diet phase (Fig. 1).",d847c340-1f04-46c4-92aa-399441fb9859

13,discussion0,"It is interesting that the fundamental difference in diet composition between the medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D) and placebo diet was the presence or absence of medium chain TAG (MCT), and that this difference was not directly apparent between the metabolic profiles. As fasted serum samples were used in this study to interrogate the global shifts in metabolism associated with diet consumption, the lack of medium chain TAG (MCT) and medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) detection may be attributed to the natural metabolic rate of these metabolites. medium chain TAG (MCT), as opposed to long-chain TAG (long chain TAG (LCT)), are used to a greater and more efficient degree 30  ,  31 . The transport process from intestinal lumen to the liver for medium chain TAG (MCT), in comparison with long chain TAG (LCT), is much faster and more efficient(  30  ,  31  ).",bb6f004e-b91d-43cd-a729-0c118dbc6202
14,discussion1," Furthermore, transport of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) into the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation does not require the carnitine shuttle system that is necessary for long-chain FA (LCFA)(  30  ). medium chain TAG (MCT) are therefore metabolised at a quicker rate when compared with long chain TAG (LCT). Furthermore, all dogs included in this study were chronically treated with the antiepileptic drugs (AED) phenobarbital (PB). It is thought that PB, primarily metabolised in the liver, also promotes induction of the cytochrome-P450 (cytochrome P450 (CYP)) enzyme system(  32  ). As it has been shown that medium chain TAG (MCT) are metabolised by some cytochrome P450 (CYP)4 isoforms, the dogs in this study, all chronically treated with PB, may have had increased rates of medium chain TAG (MCT) metabolism(  33  ). Unfortunately, it is not yet entirely clear whether the exact cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes involved in their metabolism are the same.",b4a772aa-b980-4e7c-a231-dd6346e944fc
15,discussion2," Considering the rate at which medium chain TAG (MCT) are normally metabolised compared with long chain TAG (LCT), even if medium chain TAG (MCT) and/or medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) metabolites were initially detected in the fasted serum samples, their intensities may have been too low to either pass metabolite feature QC filtering protocols applied in this study or to be considered significant in subsequent statistical tests.  When considering global shifts in lipid metabolism, as a result of medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D) consumption, medium chain TAG (MCT) and/or medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) metabolites may have been metabolised into downstream products by de novo hepatic synthesis and/or lipogenesis pathways (online Supplementary Fig. S2). In a rat hepatocyte model study, C14-radiolabelled lauric FA (C12 : 0) was shown to be rapidly converted to palmitic FA (C16 : 0) by two successive elongations(  31  ).",f9a354b6-9eba-4736-8101-6a7da7a9ad45
16,discussion3," In another randomised cross-over study, over-feeding of an medium chain TAG (MCT)-enriched diet also resulted in elevation of serum C16 : 0, C18 : 0 and C18 : 1 FA(  34  ). Hill et al. 34 hypothesised that it was highly likely that excess dietary medium chain TAG (MCT) results in de novo hepatic synthesis of LCFA by chain elongation and/or desaturation of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA). Others have since shown that medium chain TAG (MCT) consumption not only increases medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) in portal circulation but also C16 : 0, C18 : 0, C18 : 1 and C20 : 4 FA moieties in the lymphatic TAG(  35  ). It was shown that levels of linoleic acid (C18 : 2) in lymphatic TAG correlated with the type of TAG consumed, with more C18 : 2 moieties seen in long chain TAG (LCT) consumption when compared with medium chain TAG (MCT) consumption(  35  ). Results presented by You et al. (34) and Hill et al.",e4b252d5-d1cf-4c71-bde9-eadabdd935f2
17,discussion4," (35) are in accordance with the results presented in this study, whereby the diet containing relatively higher levels of long chain TAG (LCT) resulted in higher abundance of C18 : 2 moieties, and diets containing medium chain TAG (MCT) resulted in higher abundances of C18 : 0 and C20 : 4 moieties. Therefore, we speculate that medium chain TAG (MCT) may have been metabolised, by way of de novo lipogenesis, potentially into fatty acyl moieties shown to be significantly higher in abundance during the medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D), such as PC metabolites containing C18 : 0 fatty acyl moieties (online Supplementary Fig. S2).  Consumption of the medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D), when compared with the standardised placebo diet, resulted in significant differences in serum metabolites, predominantly PC metabolites. Most interestingly, lysoPC (17:0) and PC (17:0/20:4) were higher in abundance during the medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D) phase.",2cba2723-ec8a-45ce-963e-7a316d8be427
18,discussion5," Fatty acid metabolism typically involves multiple rounds of 2-C cleavage from FA by β-oxidation to produce acetyl-CoA, which can be used in other metabolic pathways such as the Krebs cycle, and the acyl-CoA molecule where the FA moiety becomes two carbons shorter (online Supplementary Fig. S3). Therefore, under normal biological pathways, it is uncommon to see FA or PC with an odd number of fatty acyl moieties. Previously, it was thought that odd-chain FA, such as C15 : 0 or C17 : 0, were only introduced into the body through dietary consumption, predominantly from ruminant fats(  36  ). However, recently it was shown that some odd-chain FA, such as C17 : 0, are substantially endogenously biosynthesised, whereas others, such as C15 : 0, are indeed introduced through dietary intake(  37  ). Although the exact mechanisms of C17 : 0 biosynthesis are unknown, it has been hypothesised that propionyl-CoA elongation and/or α-oxidation of C18 : 0 contributed to C17 : 0 FA biosynthesis(  37  ).",2d285f10-80f8-40af-ae25-ae5d479fdb12
19,discussion6," In lipid metabolism, α-oxidation refers to a metabolic process that results in the removal of a single carbon unit from a fatty acyl chain, whereas β-oxidation refers to the metabolic removal of two carbon units. Jenkins et al. (37) showed that phytanic acid, a substrate for α-oxidation, significantly decreased C17 : 0 biosynthesis by competitive inhibition, further suggesting that C17 : 0 is biosynthesised by α-oxidation. Here we present data showing significant increases in C17 : 0 moieties during the medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D) phase when compared with the placebo, where the only difference between the diet phases was the presence or absence of medium-chain (C8, C10 and C12) fatty acyl moieties. This further suggests that C17 : 0 may indeed be biosynthesised via lipogenesis processes (online Supplementary Fig. S2).",a6bcf104-6001-4459-b337-fb214b63e97d
20,discussion7," Furthermore, we also showed higher abundances of PC metabolites containing C18 : 0 moieties during the medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D) phase, further allowing the potential for α-oxidative biosynthesis of C17 : 0 from C18 : 0 moieties, as suggested by Jenkins et al. (  37  ).  Detection of C17 : 0 moieties in lipid metabolites is particularly interesting when considering the neuroprotective properties of triheptanoin, a TAG consisting of three heptanoate (C7 : 0) FA, especially as C17 : 0 fatty acyl moieties can be metabolised to C7 : 0 moieties after five cycles of β-oxidation (online Supplementary Fig. S2). It is hypothesised that triheptanoin may influence anaplerotic mechanisms in the brain by replenishing tricarboxylic acid cycle substrates and intermediates and in effect improve and/or support mitochondrial metabolic pathways(  38  ,  39  ).",5eba1e11-953f-4516-ad95-c0af1a073fbe
21,discussion8," In a rat model of cortical spreading depression, it was shown that triheptanoin decreased brain cerebral excitability during short-term KD treatment(  40  ). Conversely, Costa et al. (41) showed that heptanoate is predominately metabolised by glia and proposed that the anticonvulsant effects of triheptanoin may in fact stem from glial metabolism. Although the exact mechanisms are currently unknown, a myriad of published literature have highlighted positive neurological effects of triheptanoin(  38  ,  39  ,  42  –  45  ).  As discussed, LCFA are unable to cross the mitochondrial membrane and require the carnitine shuttle system before being metabolised by β-oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix. One study investigating the effects of sunflower oil (long chain TAG (LCT)) consumption in healthy children showed that a general increase was seen in all straight-chain acylcarnitines(  46  ).",c6be4728-8490-48b9-89da-8510cdf8693b
22,discussion9," It has been hypothesised that efflux of acylcarnitines occurs in healthy individuals as a mechanism of freeing the substrate CoA for other metabolic processes and that acylcarnitine efflux is thought to depend on intracellular acylcarnitine concentrations(  47  ). Alternatively, acylcarnitine metabolites detected in the blood may also originate from intestinal re-absorption of bile acylcarnitines(  47  ). We showed that three acylcarnitine metabolites, with acyl chains of C16 : 0, C18 : 1 and C18 : 0, were significantly lower during the medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D) phase. The placebo diet, presented in this study, was completely void of medium chain TAG (MCT) but instead supplemented with lard, which contains long chain TAG (LCT)(  7  ).",e0a1bb36-6f9d-4df9-8f10-f83a73445b52
23,discussion10," Higher abundances of acylcarnitine metabolites seen in the placebo diet may be attributed to increased acylcarnitine formation from the additional 5·5 % long chain TAG (LCT) present in the placebo diet, and subsequent exportation of these acylcarnitines out of cells and into the blood.   Conclusion  Considering the consistent neuroprotective effectiveness seen in different medium chain TAG (MCT) KD, it is likely that the overall mechanistic pathways involved are multifactorial. We showed that consumption of the medium chain TAG diet (medium chain TAG (MCT)D) by dogs with idiopathic epilepsy resulted in an increase in C17 : 0 fatty acyl chain containing metabolites in their serum, when compared with a standardised placebo diet. Future studies should aim to characterise the involvement and importance of C17 : 0 fatty acyl chain or odd-number fatty acyl chain moieties in medium chain TAG (MCT) metabolism.",f88de048-cd27-4c02-8128-d33ec343238e
24,discussion11," Elucidating the exact mechanisms of medium chain TAG (MCT) metabolic pathways and the mechanisms of action resulting in neuroprotective effects will undoubtedly facilitate the development of novel treatment strategies for both canines and humans with undesirable neurological conditions.
