0,background0," The Warburg effect, also termed “aerobic glycolysis”, is one of the most remarkable and ubiquitous metabolic characteristics exhibited by cancer cells, representing a potential vulnerability that might be targeted for tumor therapy. Ketogenic diets (KDs), composed of high-fat, moderate-protein and low carbohydrates, are aimed at targeting the Warburg effect for cancer treatment, which have recently gained considerable attention. However, the efficiency of KDs was inconsistent, and the genotypic contribution is still largely unknown. ",255dd86d-27f6-48e5-8af7-75cda4e13d2e
1,methods0," Data Sources  All RNA-seq gene expression data, somatic mutation data and clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were downloaded from Xena (https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/). Only the samples with clinical information available were kept for the following analysis. As a result, a total of 11,031 samples including 719 non-tumor tissues and 10,312 tumor tissues representing 33 cancer types were included. Microarray dataset GSE36133 (from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project) (26) was collected to analyze the metabolic pattern of cancer cell lines. Two single-cell datasets [GSE109774 (27) and GSE103867 (28)], which contain nearly 100,000 cells from 20 mouse organs and two hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines (HuH-1 and HuH-7), separately, were used to validate the expression patterns of glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) at the single-cell level in normal tissue and tumor cell lines.",98e3edf4-c2e6-48fb-8c44-ed65f6a843ab
2,methods1,"  Curation of Glycolytic and Ketone Bodies Metabolic Gene Signatures  Gene sets involved in glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) were initially retrieved from the Molecular Signatures Database v 7.1 (MSigDB) (29). Three pathways regarding glycolysis from KEGG, REACTOME, and HALLMARK were taken into consideration. The intersected 11 genes among these three gene sets were used as marker genes for glycolysis. Then, we searched the MSigDB for ketone bodies related gene sets and reviewed the genes manually. The 10 genes from the Reactome_ketone_body_metabolism gene set were most reasonable and considered as ketone bodies metabolic (ketone bodies metabolism (KBM)) gene signatures ( Figure S1 ).  Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA)  Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) is an extension of GSEA, which calculates separate enrichment scores for each pairing of a sample and gene set (30).",09291f2f-c785-4497-87ee-9c8456933be0

Classification of Metabolic Expression Subtypes Based on Glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM)  The ssGSEA score was further transformed by Z-score for glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) among samples in each dataset. Patients or cancer cell lines were assigned to four metabolic subtypes based on the ssGSEA Z-score: the glycolytic subtype (glycolysis ≥0, ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) < 0), the KB-metabolic subtype (glycolysis<0, ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) ≥0), the mixed subtype (glycolysis<0, ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) ≥0), and inactive subtypes (glycolysis<0, ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) <0).",af2cffd6-9572-4ab4-89a2-b95150f20999

Survival Analysis  The hazard ratio (HR) was estimated using a Cox regression model using the survival R package. Survival analysis was carried out using Kaplan-Meier methods and the log-rank test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences. The survival curve was generated by the R survminer package.  Cell Line and Culturing  The human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line HuH-7 and SK-HEP-1 were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Thermofisher, NY, USA).

Animal Studies  Male BALB/c nude mice (6 weeks old) were obtained from the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China). All experimental procedures using animals were in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Medical School of Nanjing University. SK-HEP-1 or HuH-7 cells were subcutaneously injected into the flank of nude mice. The tumors were allowed to grow until they were palpable before initiating each treatment. The mice were randomly divided into two groups. The control group was fed the normal diet (ND), whereas the treatment group was fed a ketogenic diet (KD). The ketogenic diet was purchased from Dyets (http://www.dyets-cn.com/, #HF89.5), which consisted of 0.1% carbohydrates, 89.5% fat, and 10.4% protein.",81156260-44d6-448e-b47a-2e9def028b01

We firstly explored the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to identify glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) signature genes. The intersected 11 genes among the glycolysis pathway from the KEGG, Reactome, and Hallmark annotations were considered as the glycolysis signature ( Figure S1A ). We also compared the curated ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) gene sets from MSigDB. The gene set named Reactome Ketone Body Metabolism represented the most reasonable summary of the ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) pathway, thus all the 10 genes from this gene set were selected as ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) signature ( Figure S1B ).

12,results3," Overall, most glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) signature genes were differentially expressed across cancer types, with glycolysis signature genes upregulated ( Figure 1C ), whereas ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) signature genes downregulated in most cancer types ( Figure 1D ). To further clarify the involvement of abnormal glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) in tumor progression, the correlations between signature genes and outcomes were assessed using both Cox analysis and log-rank analysis. Their associations with patient survival varied significantly by different cancer types, in which most glycolysis signature genes were associated with worse survival ( Figure 1E ).

We next aimed to characterize the metabolic activities of glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) based on the expression pattern of their signature genes using the ssGSEA method. Glycolysis was upregulated in most tumors compared to matched non-tumor tissues as calculated by ssGSEA score ( Figure 2A ). On the contrary, ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) was downregulated in many cancer types ( Figure 2B ). A weak negative correlation was observed between glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) ( Figure S2A ).",f22206d6-1f58-484a-8e38-a1b587c88b01

Associations with patient outcomes were examined for every cancer type individually. High glycolysis activity indicated a higher death risk in eight The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer types (HR>1, Figure 2C ), whereas high ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) metabolic activity had a favorable effect in five cancer types (HR <1, Figure 2D ). Notably, both glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) were negatively correlated with patient prognosis in UVM and LGG, indicating that these cancers may have unique metabolic features.

We further combined all cases of the 33 different cancer types into one dataset (Pan Cancer (PANCAN)) and the Kaplan-Meier curves were utilized to display patient survival for all The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cases (34). Overall, higher glycolysis activity contributes to poorer outcomes ( Figure 2E ), whereas higher ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) patients had prolonged overall survival ( Figure 2F ). Patients were classified into four categories based on glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) levels.

20,results11," The p-value was determined by log-rank test.  Metabolic Expression Subtypes Are Associated With Different Somatic Drivers  The metabolic phenotype of tumor cells is largely controlled intrinsically by tumorigenic mutations (35). To identify genetic alterations that potentially drive the metabolic subtypes, we performed a correlation analysis and plotted the oncoplot of the top 20 mutated genes for each cancer type categorized by metabolic subtypes. We observed that glycolytic subtype harbors higher mutational ratio of TP53 [35/83 (42.2%) vs. 39/158 (24.7%), p=0.008], but a significant lower mutational ratio of CTNNB1 [5/83 (6.0%) vs. 65/158 (41.1%), p= 2.75e-08] than KB-metabolic subtype in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ( Figure 4A ). No other mutations showed differential distribution. Also, negative associations were detected between glycolytic subtypes and tumor grade (p= 2.33e-03), stage (p= 1.12e-04) and overall survival (p= 6.65e-03).",b34b0c26-2a82-4b5b-8860-b1ddffac0f88

Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used to compare the median values of two sets of continuous variables. The count data were analyzed with Pearson Chi-Square.  Similarly, the phenomenon that glycolytic subtypes had much higher mutation frequency of TP53 was observed in ACC, HNSC and LUSC ( Figure S4 ). Notably, no patients in the KB-metabolic subtype harbor TP53 mutations (0/14 vs. 7/21), with more patients bearing CTNNB1 mutations (3/14 vs. 2/21) than glycolytic subtype in ACC. Furthermore, we compared the glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) score in Pan Cancer (PANCAN) dataset (n= 9632).

Five human neuroblastoma and glioma cell lines had response data available, two of which are experimentally verified to be responders of KDs. Of note, both cell lines were identified as glycolytic subtypes in our study ( Figure 5D ). Similarly, KDs are reported to have an anti-tumor effect in 8505C, a thyroid carcinoma cell line, as well as HCT 116, a large intestine cell line, both of which are identified as glycolytic subtypes in our study.

Validating the Predictive Utility of Metabolic Subtypes in Response to ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) Using the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Xenograft Model  We further performed a proof-of-concept experiment to validate the predictive utility of the metabolic subtypes in ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) using xenograft models. Only three subtypes are predicted to be present in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines ( Figure 6A ). We selected two representative lines, SK-HEP-1 (glycolytic subtype) and HuH-7 (KB-metabolic subtype) for in vivo examination of KD sensitivity ( Figure 6B ).

As anticipated, SK-HEP-1 tumor volumes were markedly reduced in the KD group compared to the ND group ( Figure 7A , left panel). However, the HuH-7 tumors in the KD group even had a trend to grow faster than that in the ND group ( Figure 7B , left panel).

HMGCS2 and OXCT1, the rate-limiting enzyme of ketogenesis or ketolysis respectively (36), were expressed higher in HuH-7 tumors compared to SK-HEP-1 ones ( Figures 7D, E ). However, HK2, ENO2 and PKM2, the vital key enzymes in the metabolic process of glycolysis (37, 38), were highly expressed in SK-HEP-1 tumors ( Figures 7D, E ), which was consistent with the results obtained from big data ( Figures 6A, B ).

32,discussion0," The Warburg effect is an extensively studied phenomenon characterized by increased aerobic glycolysis and excessive lactate formation (5). Numerous studies have shown that enhanced glycolysis predicts poor prognosis, promotes tumor progression, immune escape and drug resistance in different categories of cancers (39, 40). The classic Warburg effect describes the shift from on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis, it should be noted that cancer cells can switch their metabolism phenotypes between glycolysis and on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during tumorigenesis and metastasis (41). Ketone bodies generated by fatty acid oxidation can serve as an alternative fuel for on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (42). Thus, it’s worthwhile to comprehensively characterize the glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) pathway. The connections between ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) and cancer are rapidly emerging (36, 43).",ff5133c8-fbdb-4106-9e59-69de3892fb3e

Based on the expression profiles of these genes, we identified the glycolytic and KB-metabolic subtypes, which highly expressed the glycolysis or ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) signature genes respectively, and also characterized a hybrid metabolic subtype and an inactive subtype. The metabolic expression subtypes showed extensive heterogeneity in prognosis across cancer types. Surprisingly, the inactive subtypes, with low activity of both glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM), which were supposed to be low malignancy, tended to show a worse overall survival in KIRC, LUSC and MESO.",2df4fb8e-385c-4511-a0b4-e478347603b1
34,discussion2," A possible explanation for this might be that the inactive subtypes are not fully metabolically inactive, for other metabolic pathways might compensate for the low activity of glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) in these cancer types. Although the previous research has reported that expression patterns of metabolic genes could reflect metabolic activities in cancer patients (32), further study is still warranted to clarify the relationship between the level of metabolic gene expression and glycolysis or ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) pathway activities.  Theoretically ketogenic diet, which reduces glucose availability to tumor cells, while providing ketone bodies as an alternative bioenergetic fuel to normal cells, could result in selective starvation of tumor cells, for tumor cells are unable to adapt to ketone metabolism as a result of their acquired metabolic inflexibility and genomic instability (14).",641fbf7b-a6f2-49be-b5ce-8ce616352c42
35,discussion3," However, the efficiency of KD was inconsistent, with both the anti-tumor effects and pro-tumor effects were well-reported in preclinical and clinical studies (15). It is necessary to explore the sensitive indicators that predict or affect KD effectiveness. In this study, we found that the metabolic expression subtypes based on glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) activity are informative about the ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT). KDs reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in the SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2) xenografts (23, 44, 45), both of which were identified as the glycolytic subtype in our study. Three human glioma cell lines, which were either identified as mixed or inactive subtypes in our study, were proven to be non-responders to KDs (46). Similarly, our metabolic subtypes predicted the positive response to KDs in thyroid cancer (47) and large intestine cancer cell lines (48, 49).",2d82c281-1896-4283-bd5c-c1747b396fcd
36,discussion4," It has been reported that ketone bodies can behave as onco-metabolites and that ketone bodies utilization drives tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancers (19, 50). Interestingly, none of the cell lines were identified as glycolytic subtypes in our study. Thus, the metabolic subtypes are informative about the response to ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), although these findings may be somewhat limited by the small number of cases. We further performed a proof-of-concept experiment to validate the predictive value of the metabolic subtype using liver cancer, a cancer type with conflicting responses to ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) was reported (51, 52). Consistently, KDs reduced the growth of the cell line belongs to the glycolytic subtype, but tended to promote the growth of the KB-metabolic subtype cell line.",c4ca59a2-ffae-401f-84a9-ab3edebc3e36
37,discussion5," Therefore, the metabolic expression subtypes defined here have potential clinical implications in guiding personalized ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), and further efforts will be required to validate the findings in other cancer types. Metabolic flexibility, which means the intrinsic ability of cells to change from one metabolic fuel source to another (53), is one of the most important characteristics of cancers (54). Thus, the adaptability of different cancer cells to metabolic changes cannot be ignored, which may affect the efficacy of metabolic therapy. It is a limitation to just consider the initial state of the cancer metabolism instead of the metabolic changes. Also, other metabolic signatures besides glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) may be of importance because of the metabolic adaptability.  Metabolic reprogramming may result from diverse somatic driver alterations. We explored the somatic mutations underlying the different subtypes.",231329ce-0090-41f3-9a9b-ec8264a86f1d
38,discussion6," TP53 mutations were associated with glycolytic subtype, while CTNNB1 mutations were correlated to the KB-metabolic subtype. This observation may support the hypothesis that TP53-driven tumors are candidates for ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), while β-catenin-driven tumors are in the contrast. Previous research has established that TP53 mutations increase glycolysis in multiple cancer types (55–59). Several attempts have also been made to illustrate the role of CTNNB1 and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM). It has been reported that HMGCS2, a rate-limiting ketogenic enzyme in the synthesis of ketone bodies, was is a novel target of Wnt/β-catenin (60). Moreover, recent studies have shown that β-catenin-activated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were not glycolytic but intensively oxidized fatty acids. PPARα, the key transcription factor taking part in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, is also a β-catenin target (33, 61). Therefore, β-catenin may control the ketogenesis process.",2fa98a5f-b478-493e-ad18-26972ac7c511
39,discussion7," In our study, we found that both ketogenesis and ketolysis enzymes were highly expressed in the KB-metabolic subtype. However, the relationship between β-catenin and ketolysis has not yet been deciphered. Continued efforts are needed to assess the broader role of β-catenin in ketone bodies metabolism (KBM).  Conclusions  In conclusion, we performed a joint analysis of glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) genes in this study. We identified four subtypes based on the activity of glycolysis and ketone bodies metabolism (KBM) pathway. The subtypes were correlated extensively but diversely with clinical outcomes and somatic mutations. Both literature review and a proof-of-concept experiment provide preliminary but exciting evidence supporting that our subtypes were informative about the response to ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), and further studies both in the laboratory and clinically will still be warranted.",1dfed91e-2306-409b-a455-2043b5e5e7ce
