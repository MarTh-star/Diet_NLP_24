0,methods0," Ethics statement  This study was performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)) of Northwestern University (protocol #5715), and allowed for flank tumors to reach a volume of 6,000 mm3 (maximum dimensions of 20 mm x 30 mm). All surgery was performed under isoflurane inhalant anesthesia. Every effort was made to minimize animal suffering. Patient-derived cell lines were all developed under the auspices of an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol at Mayo Clinic and Duke University, with consent obtained from their donors.  Cell lines and cell culture  Five cell types were derived from the Mayo Clinic Brain Tumor Patient-Derived Xenograft National Resource [16].",d5dcdc57-aebc-4cfe-b5c5-cdad875a97cf
1,methods1," Three were isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1wt glioblastomas (glioblastoma (GBM)6, glioblastoma (GBM)12, and glioblastoma (GBM)43), and 2 were isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut grade 4 astrocytomas (glioblastoma (GBM)164 and glioblastoma (GBM) 196). Two additional isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut cell types were TB09, a WHO grade 3 astrocytoma obtained from Dr Hai Yan at Duke University, and HT1080, a fibrosarcoma cell line from the American Type Culture Collection (the fibrosarcoma cell line was chosen to directly compare any possible differences in proliferation based solely on isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut status). All isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut cells were R132H except for HT1080, which was R132C isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1. NPA and NPAC1 were rodent isogenic cell lines engineered using the Sleeping Beauty transposase system, gifted courtesy of Dr. Maria Castro from the University of Michigan [17].",689a11d6-dc65-463e-9dbd-7704f6c50d2c

6,methods6," The cell suspension was centrifuged after mechanical disruption, filtered through 70 μM nylon-mesh filters, re-centrifuged, and re-suspended in an equal volume ratio of cell culture media to Matrigel. A 16-gauge needle and syringe were used to inject the cell suspension into the flanks of 6 week-old female NCr athymic nude mice (NCRNU-F sp/sp, Taconic).  Intracranial injections of NPA and NPAC1 cells were performed as described previously in 10 week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson) [17].  Animals received post-operative support care through administration of 0.9% saline solution, DietGel 76A, and thermal support while recovering from anesthesia until awake and ambulatory. One administration of meloxicam 1 mg/kg was given at the time of the procedure for 24 hour analgesia coverage, followed by another dose approximately 24 hours post-procedure, and a final dose 48 hours post-procedure if deemed necessary.",0a67e58c-a59a-4f96-a098-7d67fd43b79b
7,methods7,"  Animal monitoring and treatment  All animals were fed standard rodent chow (standard diet, or SD) for 3 days following flank or intracerebral engraftment before being randomized to either remain on SD ad libitum, or given a formulated KD (Ketogenic Diet TD.96355, Envigo Teklad Diets, Madison WI) ad libitum. The KD was received directly from the manufacturer and was a nutritionally complete diet composed of 15.3% protein, 0.5% carbohydrate, and 67.4% fat by weight (Table 2). Mice assigned to the KD group were kept on KD for one week, followed by SD for one week, and so on, in order to prevent obesity and reduce midlife mortality. Mice were still allowed to feed ad libitum, in order to reduce potentially confounding effects of weight loss from calorie-restricted diets and more effectively maintain plasma ketone levels, as was described by others [13, 18].",27e86331-2887-40c9-9184-fd49b290a0c2
8,methods8," At the end of each week, blood from the saphenous vein was collected to test circulating metabolite levels using the Precision Xtra Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System (Abbott SKU# 9881465). Animals were monitored twice weekly for signs of morbidity, such as weight loss, behavioral changes, and hunched positions, and were euthanized when tumor size reached 2,000 mm3 (below the maximum Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-approved volume), or when moribund. Euthanasia was performed via CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation, in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-approved guidelines.  10.1371/journal.pone.0257725.t002 Table 2 Summary of macronutrient composition of standard and experimental diets presented as proportion of total kilocalories.

10,results0," First, we examined the effects of a ketogenic-like diet on cultured isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1wt and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut patient-derived cancer cell lines under the following conditions: (i) normal basal glucose (NG) of 4.5 g/L; (ii) low glucose (LG) of 1.0 g/L; (iii) NG with 10 mM β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB); (iv) LG with BHB (Fig 1). Both pairs of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1wt and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut cell types responded similarly, with slightly attenuated proliferation in LG medium, but no effect of BHB in either NG or LG medium, as indicated by two-way ANOVA analyses (Table 3). Specifically, among isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1wt glioblastoma (GBM)6 cells, proliferation was higher in NG than LG (F (1, 8) = 10.0, P = 0.013), but BHB had no effect in either NG or LG media (F (1,8) = 0.20, P = 0.66). There was also no statistically significant interaction between glucose and BHB (F (1,8) = 0.0048, P = 0.95).",24a21e92-e28a-41fa-bab2-78326bb471c2

Each analysis was done on the last day of culture for each cell type, as indicated in Fig 1.  Next, we evaluated the ability of an unrestricted, cycling KD (see “Methods”) to induce ketosis in mice without tumors. Over the first 5 weeks that mice were on KD, blood glucose levels were similar to control mice on SD, even during weeks in which KD was implemented (Fig 2A). Interestingly, blood glucose rose 15% in KD mice after week 6 (147.8 mg/dl in KD versus 128.0 mg/dl in SD, P = 0.0029) (Fig 2A). This persisted in week 7 (144.3 mg/dl in KD versus 127.3 mg/dl in SD, P = 0.0053). Ketones, in contrast, increased by 112.5% after just one week on KD compared to mice on SD (1.",2813dce0-ecf6-4c62-ad39-c4f8558edce1

While circulating ketones declined in KD mice during the weeks when they were back on SD, they remained 81–236% higher than in SD mice over the entire 7-week interval, consistent with previously published data by other who employed this type of KD [13, 18]. Body mass was 13% higher in KD mice than SD mice by week 4 (26.3 grams versus 23.3 grams, P = 0.033), but this was transient, as the mass of the SD mice matched the KD mice by week 6 (Fig 2C).  10.1371/journal.pone.0257725.g002 Fig 2 Basic metabolic parameters of mice on an unrestricted cycling KD.

14,results5,"  Mice bearing subcutaneous flank patient-derived xenografts (patient derived xenografts (PDX)) of endogenous isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1wt glioblastoma (GBM)12, or isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut grade 4 astrocytoma (glioblastoma (GBM)164 and glioblastoma (GBM)196), were subjected to the unrestricted cycling KD or kept on regular SD. (The flank was chosen because isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut glioblastoma (GBM)164 and glioblastoma (GBM)196 cells grow poorly intracerebrally and in vitro, and these two patient derived xenografts (PDX) models were chosen for in vivo studies because isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut TB09 cells grow poorly in vivo.) As expected, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1wt glioblastoma (GBM)12 grew faster than isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut glioblastoma (GBM)164 and glioblastoma (GBM)196 (Fig 3).",6f849ef8-b92c-436a-8676-167c2a1a3b8e

16,results7,"  To determine the effect of unrestricted cycling KD on intracerebral, isogenic-matched isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1wt and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut gliomas, we engrafted isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1wt NPA and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut NPAC1 glioma cells (Table 1) into the brains of immunocompetent mice (Fig 4). Among mice maintained on SD, those engrafted with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut NPAC1 cells survived 20% longer than mice engrafted with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1wt NPA cells (median survival 26.5 days versus 22.0 days, HR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.03–0.39, P = 0.0022), in keeping with published data on these models [17].

18,discussion0," Altered metabolism in cancer cells raises the possibility of exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities to inhibit tumor growth, such as putting patients on KD. However, while KD may have efficacy against some cancers, clinical studies have been limited in glioma patients, and have so far mostly focused on feasibility, not outcomes [15, 21–26]. At the preclinical level, some studies showed that mice engrafted with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1wt glioblastoma (GBM) did not benefit from KD [13, 27], although others have suggested otherwise [28], and to the best of our knowledge, there has not yet been a direct experimental comparison of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1wt and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut gliomas exposed to KD. Another study by others suggested that isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut might confer sensitivity to KD, based on in vitro data using HCT116 cells engineered to express isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1 R132H [14].",ee5ce554-f5c8-4334-a333-b84fd37e8881
19,discussion1," Thus, we sought to determine KD efficacy in a variety of preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1wt and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut glioma. Our data suggest that an unrestricted cycling KD does not have significant activity against either isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)wt or isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut glioma.  Since the original studies describing isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut and its neoenzymatic activity in cancer, a great deal of research has been done studying the metabolic effects of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut, often generating conflicting results.",3541b5d2-d14b-4b92-91ab-e6249939ee47
20,discussion2," For example, while some have shown that isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut depletes the cell of tri carboxylic acid (TCA) intermediates [29–34], others have found little to no changes in those intermediates [10, 35, 36]; indeed, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut gliomas may actually use lactate and glutamate anaplerosis to replenish tri carboxylic acid (TCA) intermediates [35]. Some have suggested that glycolysis is reduced in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut gliomas [34, 36], but one group found reduced glucose uptake by isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut glioma cells, and otherwise no difference in the rate of glycolysis compared to isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)wt cells [37].",089416c1-1650-464b-8312-cd4cd2d077d5
21,discussion3,"  Results in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut metabolic research seem to vary greatly depending on whether one is studying cells artificially overexpressing isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut, or is focusing on cells and tissues with endogenous isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut, as more pronounced metabolic changes tend to occur in the former than the latter [37]. This suggests that cells with naturally-occurring isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut may, over time, adjust their metabolism to at least partially compensate for perturbations caused by the mutant enzyme. For example, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut gliomas may adjust for the depletion of tri carboxylic acid (TCA) intermediates by upregulating glutamate dehydrogenase 2 expression [34]. Since isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut gliomas mostly use the tri carboxylic acid (TCA) precursor glutamine to produce D2HG, these tumors compensate by turning pyruvate into tri carboxylic acid (TCA) chemicals [38, 39].",e3a7313c-2f3c-432a-a10c-2eb04a139727
22,discussion4," Although isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut consumes NAPDH, which should lead to glutathione depletion, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut gliomas upregulate enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis, thereby maintaining glutathione levels [40]. Thus, when isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)wt wild-type cells are abruptly forced to overexpress isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut, any metabolic results, including sensitivity to KD-like conditions, need to be validated in patient-derived and/or transgenic models with endogenous isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut.  Just as there is heterogeneity in metabolism-themed isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut research, a variety of KD regimens have been studied in preclinical models of disease. Two major sources of such variation include ad libitum versus caloric restriction, and cycling versus non-cycling KD.",d3efad66-2d0b-4895-8dd8-5c33950f6d32
23,discussion5," In one study combining non-cycling KD and caloric restriction in mice intracranially engrafted with syngeneic isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)wt CT-2A gliomas, caloric restriction on a regular diet reduced tumor growth, but the addition of KD to the caloric restriction had no significant effect [41]. Another study from the same group showed that a different calorie-restricted, non-cycling KD slowed the in vivo growth of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)wt CT-2A mouse glioma cells and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)wt U87-MG human glioma cells [42]. However, a different group reported that an unrestricted, non-cycling KD was able to slow the in vivo growth of isogenic GL-261 mouse glioma cells [43, 44], and such diets do lead to an accumulation of BHB within engrafted tumors [28, 43]. In a nontumor preclinical model of aging, an unrestricted cycling KD reduced midlife mortality and improved memory in C57/BL6 mice [18].",6692ede9-19a1-4c9b-bee6-7b18467a3aad
24,discussion6," Since that type of KD had never been tried in animal models of gliomas, and prolonged adherence to KD is notoriously difficult [15, 45], we tested that same unrestricted cycling KD regimen in both patient-derived and engineered mouse glioma cells, with negative results in both settings.  A recent patient-based study showed that KD causes similarly elevated levels of ketones within isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)wt and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)mut gliomas by magnetic resonance spectroscopy [15], but patient survival was not a part of that analysis. Other recent preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that gliomas can metabolically adapt to ketogenesis, and even use ketones to facilitate disease progression [25, 27]. Our in vitro and in vivo experimental results align with such studies, and show that, despite achieving a ketosis-like state in tumor bearing animals, no difference in overall tumor volume or survival benefit was observed.",4560a995-9555-456c-b30f-ee4a92228a03
25,discussion7," Thus, our data suggest that an unrestricted cycling KD does not have a role in glioma patients, regardless of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1mut status. =",cab8b151-8858-4c15-b7c7-a99d2c61ff6c
