Twenty-two of them (11 females and 11 males) completed the study protocol and were included in the analyses (Figure 1 and Table 1). All participants were recreational CrossFit athletes, members of four CrossFit clubs in Poznań, Poland (Caffeine Barbell, Hangar, Reebok CrossFit Poznań, and Rankor Athletics). Inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 40 years, a valid and up-to-date medical certificate of the athlete’s ability to practice sports, at least 2 years of CrossFit training experience, and at least four CrossFit trainings per week. Both males and females were included because of the equal participation of both sexes in CrossFit training and to assess whether a KD has sex-specific impacts.",8e90b92b-930c-43fd-bb86-81b78fb17634
1,methods1," Exclusion criteria were smoking, drug and dietary supplement usage, alcohol consumption (>1–2 drinks/week), consuming a special diet within 3 weeks of the study’s commencement, and pregnancy or menstrual cycle disorders.  The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the local institutional review board (Bioethics Committee at Poznań University of Medical Sciences, reference numbers: 681/16 and 683/16, 10 November 2016). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before the study began. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. The trial was conducted from January to December 2017. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Clinical Trial Identification Number: NCT03665948; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03665948, accessed on 2 March 2021).

2,methods2," The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.  2.2. Study Design, Protocol, and Visits  The entire study protocol and diet characteristics are thoroughly described in our previous paper [8]. The study protocol included three visits (T0, T1, and T2) to the laboratory (Figure 1). The CrossFit participants were very familiar with the CrossFit-specific exercise tests. Furthermore, the participants were familiarised with the entire study protocol, such as the incremental cycling (ICT), anthropometric measurements, food recording method, and physical activity questionnaire, during the first visit (T0).  The KD diet was individualised to ensure weight maintenance (assessed using a Bod Pod® analyser; Cosmed, Rome, Italy) throughout the dietary intervention, and diets were energetically normalised (based on estimated energy expenditure via heart rate (HR) monitoring using a Polar RS-400, Vantaa, Finland, as described previously [8,37,38]).",8c8d6041-a56e-491b-b0bb-c8a21f294aef
3,methods3," The main dietary assumptions concerned the intake of ≥75% daily energy from fat, 1.7 g of protein per kilogram of body mass, and up to 5% energy from carbohydrates [8]. Participants following their customary diet (CD) were obligated to record all ingested food and beverages in a food diary during a 14-day run-in phase, after which the first laboratory study visit was conducted (T1). The day after T1, the same participants started following 10-day KD menus for 4 weeks and recorded their food intake using a food diary and an electronic kitchen scale. After the KD intervention, the second series of test procedures (T2) was conducted. The subjects were asked to maintain a similar training load and the same physical activity level throughout the study. Final diet intake is presented in Supplementary Table S1.",67ce2db1-8f05-4c3e-aa4b-fc8547b9418b
4,methods4," Furthermore, the KD compliance had been confirmed by ongoing monitoring of the beta-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) concentration in blood and the KB level in urine (urine ketones were tested during T1 and T2 study visits, and once weekly during KD) [8].  2.3. Exercise Tests  2.3.1. incremental cycling (ICT)  The incremental cycling (ICT) was performed at the Exercise Tests Laboratory at the Institute of Human Nutrition and Dietetics under standardised conditions in the morning and on a Kettler X1 cycloergometer (Kettler, Ense-Parsit, Germany) according to our previously published protocol [8]. Three hours before the T1 and T2 visits, the participants consumed a standardised meal corresponding to their habitual food intake or a meal corresponding to the KD menu, respectively. Cardiorespiratory indices were measured (breath by breath) using the Quark CPET ergospirometer (Cosmed, Rome, Italy).",5a089cfc-77e0-4354-b15f-5248429702f2

6,methods6," The VO2max was defined as the maximum minute VO2 when a workload increase stopped generating further increases in VO2 and HR and/or the athlete refused to continue exercising [8,37]. To determine the gas exchange threshold (GET) during the incremental cycling (ICT), the V-slope method was applied based on an analysis of the linear regression for the curve of increasing CO2 exhalation in comparison to the curve of increasing O2 uptake [37,39,40]. During the entire test, participants were encouraged by verbal motivation.  2.3.2. CrossFit-Specific Physical Performance Test  The Fight Gone Bad (FGB) workout was performed according to the protocol from our previous study [41]. The entire test lasted for 17 min (3 rounds × 5 min and 2 breaks × 1 min, between the first and second and the second and third rounds). Each single 5 min round consisted of five exercises: (a) wall ball shots, (b) sumo deadlift high pulls, (c) box jumps, (d) push presses, and (e) rowing.",8f287a68-3884-4673-b166-e367d0fae3f3
7,methods7," CrossFitters were obligated to complete as many repetitions as possible at each Fight Gone Bad (FGB) station prior to moving to the next station. The Fight Gone Bad (FGB) test was supervised by experienced CrossFit coaches to allow an accurate count of all properly executed repetitions. For each valid repetition, a participant needed to complete a full range of motion required for a specific exercise. Each Fight Gone Bad (FGB) test was performed in the afternoon on the day after the incremental cycling (ICT). It was performed in the natural condition in CrossFit boxes where the participants usually trained. Moreover, during exercise tests, the researchers and coaches provided verbal encouragement.  2.4.

Additionally, 300 µL of capillary blood was collected in a Microvette® CB 300 tube (Sarstedt, Nümbrect, Germany) containing EDTA dipotassium salt as an anticoagulant for haematological measurement using a 20-parametric automated Mythic®18 haematology analyser (Orphée, Switzerland).",c2dfa49a-cd43-4757-8c55-ae47f764f33d

The calculation of the factor was based on the hypothetical haematocrit value of 0.500 L·L−1 (50%). This approach was applied to avoid misinterpretation of post-exercise blood markers results due to exercise-induced haematocrit shifts.

11,methods11," Statistical Analysis  The results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Either repeated-measures one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Wilcoxon test (for normally and non-normally distributed data, respectively) was used to compare the CD versus KD (while consuming a CD and after consuming a KD) differences for the incremental cycling (ICT), Fight Gone Bad (FGB) results, and blood markers. The sample size met the research assumptions, as previously described [8]. All the blood data referring to males and data referring to individual Fight Gone Bad (FGB) series components in males were analysed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon test. This approach is justified due to the lack of certain blood samples and data regarding particular components of detailed repetitions in individual Fight Gone Bad (FGB) rounds of several male participants and due to the small number of participants enrolled in the analyses (5 or 6 male participants, depending on the parameter).",5169c921-71f4-434a-928e-7c57026f6927

Aerobic Capacity in the incremental cycling (ICT)  There were no differences in VO2peak (Figure 2), Texh, or Wmax (Table 2) between consuming a CD and KD in the entire group or in males (Table 2 and Figure 2). However, in females, VO2peak decreased by 10.4% and was significantly lower after consuming a KD compared with a CD (Figure 2; 2.79 ± 0.29 vs. 2.50 ± 0.36 L·min−1, respectively; p = 0.027). Nevertheless, HRmax was substantially higher after consuming a KD in all participants and in females (Table 2); there was no difference in males. There were no substantial differences in time to gas exchange threshold (GET) (Tgas exchange threshold (GET)), VO2gas exchange threshold (GET), or workload at gas exchange threshold (GET) (Wgas exchange threshold (GET)) between a CD and after a KD (Table 2).",6554907a-0349-4ddf-85aa-fdfe1823cad1
13,methods13," Moreover, heart rate at gas exchange threshold (GET) (HRgas exchange threshold (GET)) was higher after consuming a KD in all participants and in males, but not in females (Table 2).  3.2. Discipline-Specific CrossFit Performance in the Fight Gone Bad (FGB) Test  There were no significant differences between consuming a CD or a KD in the total score of Fight Gone Bad (FGB) in each round (1, 2, or 3; Table S2) or the in total score when the three rounds were analysed together (Figure 3; all: p = 0.132; females: p = 0.128; males: p = 0.454). However, the number of repetitions in box jumps was higher in the entire group after consuming a KD in round 2, and in females after consuming a KD in rounds 2 and 3, as in the sum of box jumps in all rounds (Table S2).  3.3.

Indices such as pH (p = 0.028), BE (p = 0.028), and HCO3− (p = 0.028) were significantly increased, while H+ (p = 0.028), the anion gap (p = 0.028), and lactate (p = 0.028) were substantially lower after consuming a KD (Table 3). There were no vital changes in acid–base balance parameters in females.  3.3.2. Blood Biochemical Parameters  The pre-incremental cycling (ICT) exercise bilirubin concentration was elevated in the entire group after consuming a KD compared with a CD (p = 0.042; Table 4). Furthermore, in males, the AlAT activities measured pre-incremental cycling (ICT) (p = 0.043) and post-incremental cycling (ICT) (p = 0.043) exercise were significantly increased after consuming a KD (Table 4).

The pre-exercise PDW in males was substantially lower after consuming a KD compared with a CD (p = 0.043).  4. Discussion  In the present study, we investigated the influence of a 4-week KD on aerobic capacity, select blood markers, and CrossFit-specific performance in female and male CrossFit practitioners.",7d338186-6510-4f67-8d4e-ceb5ea046dd6
18,methods18," We found that consuming a KD had a rather slight impact on aerobic capacity as determined by monitoring cardiorespiratory indices during the incremental cycling (ICT), and had no relevant effect on CrossFit-specific performance based on the Fight Gone Bad (FGB) test. Consuming a KD affected blood parameters related to bilirubin and haemoglobin concentrations, mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH)C), and resulted in alterations in AlAT activity and blood acid–base balance but had a relatively minor effect on other biochemical blood indices. However, there were recognisable sex differences regarding changes in blood markers after consuming a KD.  The data on the influence of consuming a KD on aerobic capacity in CrossFit practitioners are lacking. Moreover, studies on other endurance sport disciplines have provided conflicting results.",ae0a2326-e2ce-4bc7-b629-0aeffeb1f554
19,methods19," In our current study, we found that consuming a KD significantly decreased VO2peak in females. There were no changes observed in males. Zając et al. [43] revealed a significant increase in relative values of VO2max and VO2 at lactate threshold (LT) after a 4-week KD in off-road cyclists. Burke et al. [32] reported that 3 weeks of a KD combined with intensified training and mild energy deficit, similarly to diets that either had continuously or periodically high carbohydrate availability, resulted in an increase in VO2peak in elite walkers. Moreover, there was an increase in fat oxidation capacity in the KD group, but no improvement in endurance performance [32]. A pilot case study in endurance athletes by Zinn et al. [44] showed that after 10 weeks of a KD, all participants exhibited a decrease in Texh in the incremental cycling (ICT).",99b06fec-1a82-44e3-9d93-9f1a0f3aae78
20,methods20," Moreover, there was a decrease in VO2max in four out of five participants, two participants experienced a decrease in the ventilatory threshold (another two maintained the baseline score), and four subjects noted a decrease in peak power [44]. It seems that the aforementioned changes may be explained by the metabolic alterations and, in particular, the reduction in carbohydrate oxidation. Shaw et al. [17] demonstrated that 31 days of consuming a KD preserved the mean submaximal exercise capacity without requiring carbohydrate restoration or supplementation (no changes in VO2max or Texh), but they noted impaired exercise efficiency at intensities above 70% VO2max. Furthermore, no effect of consuming a KD on various indicators of aerobic capacity (e.g., VO2max, VO2peak) has been noted in few other studies [45,46,47]. Increases in VO2max may be partially explained by decreases in body weight and improvements in participant’s aerobic capacity.",3c57f9b6-fbd6-476d-bbe6-c265e9c47f7b
21,methods21," In turn, decreases in VO2max are likely due to changes in metabolic pathways that impair glycogen metabolism at higher exercise intensities. Furthermore, we also registered that consuming a KD greatly impacted HR during the incremental cycling (ICT). HRmax was increased in the entire group and in females, while heart rate at gas exchange threshold (GET) (HRgas exchange threshold (GET)) was increased in the entire group and in males. However, HR alterations were not related to the Texh, Wmax, time to gas exchange threshold (GET) (Tgas exchange threshold (GET)), and workload at gas exchange threshold (GET) (Wgas exchange threshold (GET)) improvement during the incremental cycling (ICT). Thus, it is difficult to speculate that the CrossFitters’ adaptation level in terms of the incremental cycling (ICT) aerobic capacity and anaerobic threshold changes actually improved.",3c0937ec-1b8e-4e0b-b65e-97533364675e
22,methods22," In our opinion, only an increase in HR with simultaneous performance and/or workload improvement may be considered a beneficial and desired effect.  We would like to emphasise that, to our best knowledge, only our previous [8] and two other papers [46,48] have analysed the effect of KD in CrossFit practitioners. In our study, it was revealed that consuming a KD had no relevant effect on CrossFit-specific performance. After consuming a KD, the athletes showed improvement in only one exercise in the Fight Gone Bad (FGB) (box jumps results in second (entire group) and second and third (females) round). However, fluctuations in a single component of the Fight Gone Bad (FGB) test cannot stand as a reflection of changes in discipline-specific performance as a whole. Gregory et al.",4236a8a9-cc9c-463a-9a5f-99b949e3eec6
23,methods23," [48] found no advantage of a 6-week KD (males, n = 3; females, n = 9) over the control customary diet (males, n = 2; females, n = 13) combined with training on power (vertical and standing long jumps) and CrossFit performance (total performance time in exercises consisting of a 500 m row, 40 body weight squats, 30 abdominal mat sit-ups, 20 hand release push-ups, and 10 pull-ups), although performance was improved after both diets. Nevertheless, the KD protocol implemented in that study was slightly different than ours (<10% of energy from carbohydrates). Kephart et al. [46] found no effect of a 12-week KD on various performance indices (one-repetition-maximum squat and power clean, maximum push-up repetitions, 400 m run time, and VO2peak values assessed with a graded treadmill test) in recreationally trained CrossFit practitioners (KD group: 5 males and 2 females; control group: 4 males and 1 female). Thus, these findings are similar to our current study.",96cf3f4f-d0c6-4293-9c14-4c5798309d9f
24,methods24," It should be noted, however, that in both of the aforementioned studies, there was a small sample size in the KD diet group, especially for female CrossFitters.  To the best of our knowledge, the current study is also the first to investigate the effect of consuming a KD on the CrossFit-specific cross-sectional Fight Gone Bad (FGB) test and undertake an in-depth analysis of aerobic capacity indicators in the incremental cycling (ICT) with simultaneous control of diagnostically significant haematological, hormonal, muscular, and metabolic function markers and acid–base balance blood indices before and after progressive exercise. In addition, the possibility of verifying the impact of this diet depending on the participant’s sex is particularly valuable.  Even small changes to acid–base balance may place substantial stress on the body’s buffering mechanisms [49].",7d84da39-500e-4914-94da-8457a6fe2474
25,methods25," Previous studies [50,51] have indicated that there is a tendency towards lower blood pH and reduced HCO3− concentrations and blood base excess after a KD at rest and after exercise. The results of our study are in contrast to the previous findings. We found no differences between the diets in blood pH, H+, and HCO3− concentration or BE when analysing the entire group. When analysing males only, there were even favourable changes after consuming a KD compared with a CD in post-exercise parameters of blood acid–base balance (elevated values of pH, BE, and HCO3−, along with a lower H+ concentration). Still, the results referring to males need to be interpreted carefully because of the small number of analysed samples (n = 5). Nevertheless, the results of our study are comparable to the findings of Carr et al. [49].",d4c6f6b3-f660-42a1-8507-cdec8f13a99f
26,methods26," They found no differences in blood pH between ketogenic low-carbohydrate, high-fat or periodised carbohydrate groups at any time point, and no significant differences in pre-exercise or post-exercise (graded maximal exercise treadmill test) HCO3− concentrations between groups. It is important to note that consuming a KD may have no influence on resting or exercise-associated blood indices of acid–base status. This is probably due to the long duration of KD consumption, which was sufficient for acids to be neutralised by buffering systems in blood, respiratory, and renal systems or because of the participants’ training adaptation [49]. In our study, we found significant decrease in the post-exercise lactate concentration after consuming a KD in the entire group and in males. Only one previous study by Zając et al.",55c00cc8-b18d-46d1-8345-aa033ab48dbc
27,methods27," [43] also showed a lower plasma lactate concentration at rest, during and after an exercise protocol (varied intensity: 90 min at 85% of the LT and 15 min with a continuous effort at 115% of the LT on a cycloergometer) after consuming a KD. Other studies investigating lactate have demonstrated higher concentrations during exercise [52,53] or no effect on lactate at rest [47,52,53,54] and during exercise [17,32,54,55] after consuming a KD compared with a control diet. It is not fully understood if the lactate concentration changes depending on an inhibited lactate efflux from working muscles due to reduced blood buffering capacity or a decreased rate of glycolysis [56].  Furthermore, in our study, we found substantial increase in the post-exercise glucose (GLU) concentration in males after consuming a KD. However, as mentioned earlier, blood markers in males needs to be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size. Other studies have shown conflicting results in this measure.",d2107e43-14e8-4899-a52f-30190e943c04
28,methods28," Burke et al. [32], Phinnney et al. [47] and Urbain et al. [57] revealed a lower glucose (GLU) concentration at rest. Helge et al. [52] showed a higher glucose (GLU) concentration at exhaustion after a low-carbohydrate, fat-rich diet. However, Burke et al. [32] reported a lower glucose (GLU) concentration during exercise. Other studies on physically active people have shown no differences between groups or no effect of a KD on glucose (GLU) concentration at rest [43,45,46,47,52,53,54,58] or during exercise [17,43,53,54,55].  Few studies have measured concentrations of hormones or enzyme activity in relation to consuming a KD. One study found no significant effect of consuming a KD on testosterone and cortisol concentrations [43], while another study noted that consuming a KD enhanced pre- and post-exercise concentrations of cortisol [50]. There was also no effect of consuming a KD on CK or LDH activities at rest and during exercise [43,59].",82fa7b3e-d2b3-4ca3-8dd1-aadedd18b549
29,methods29," Similarly, there were no relevant differences in the abovementioned indices in our study. Still, significant increase in pre- and post-incremental cycling (ICT) exercise AlAT activity in males were noted. It is important to note that aminotransferase activities may increase after exercise because they are released from activated muscles (AspAT mainly from muscles and AlAT mainly from the liver). Their activities may increase with the increasing intensity and duration of exercise [60]. However, in our opinion, AlAT activity fluctuations (without simultaneous AspAT and CK alterations) suggest that consuming a KD may be somehow related to liver overload in males. This idea might also be supported through the elevated bilirubin concentration that was registered after participants consumed a KD. Human and animal studies have demonstrated that a higher bilirubin concentration has protective potential in some conditions (e.g., nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) [61,62].",5d490ca0-a846-411e-bf97-b0c2f69fa8b2
30,methods30," In addition, bilirubin changes after consuming a KD may partially explain the lower haematological parameters (haemoglobin (HGB) concentration in the blood (in the entire group and in females) via expanded haemolytic activity (taking into account that total and indirect bilirubin are often higher in athletic populations) [60]. Moreover, slight differences in hormone concentrations due to the dietary intervention may be explained by mechanisms controlling the hormonal and metabolic responses to exercise. The depletion of glycogen leads to the stimulation of glucose production and lipolysis based on the changes in the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones [63]. However, these aforementioned hypotheses are intended to consider new directions in the KD field and should be confirmed through further research.  Although there were certain statistically significant changes in haematological blood markers, not all of them seem to be clinically relevant.",1ca5074d-23a4-47c5-8dc4-67e06af18eb7
31,methods31," However, a substantial decrease in selected red cell parameters (haematological parameters (haemoglobin (HGB), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH)C)) was found at rest and post-exercise in the entire group and in females. The results are quite surprising because a KD would likely include foods characterised by high content of iron that can be well absorbed (e.g., red meat). Moreover, the mean dietary iron intake was slightly higher after consuming a KD compared with a CD in both females (~13.4 vs. ~14.1 mg·day−1; Table S1) and males (~13.8 vs. ~15.8 mg·day−1, Table S1). Still, in females, the daily iron intake from consuming a CD or a KD was lower than the dietary recommendations for athletes [4] and for the Polish population [64]. When not taking into account the haematocrit conversion factor, the pre-exercise haematological parameters (haemoglobin (HGB) concentrations in females were ~8.",146ace01-6ef6-4897-81d2-2baa5572b04c
32,methods32,"41 mmol·L−1 after consuming a CD and ~8.39 mmol·L−1 after consuming a KD and fell within the reference range (7.4–9.9 mmol·L−1 [65]). Another issue is the fluctuations in haematological status measures during the menstrual cycle [66], which we did not take into account in the current study. Nevertheless, the protocol lasted 4 weeks, which should mean that the measurements were taken in the comparable individual menstrual cycle phases. A similar situation was described in another study by Burke et al. [28]. Furthermore, the latest systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that general guidelines on exercise performance across the menstrual cycle cannot be formed (with the exception that exercise test performance may be slightly impaired during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle compared with all other phases) [67]. However, in this regard, the individual response seems to be finally crucial. The decrements in select haematological parameters (e.g.",666663f6-3885-45cb-8c4b-e2758b30bcee
33,methods33,", depicting the so-called ‘iron status’) in females were slightly reflected in aerobic capacity, namely the decrease in VO2peak after consuming a KD. Moreover, we noted an increase in monocyte (MON) and plateletcrit (PCT) counts after the KD. Still, the parameters were within reference levels after consuming either studied diet.  It should be noted that the length of KD treatment determines whether any adaptive response can be achieved. Although an increase in KBs is usually observed (with constant gluconeogenesis) after 2–3 days of KD intake, the carbohydrate energy sources are vitally depleted, which leads to deterioration of training capacity/well-being and performance in moderate-intensity (<70% VO2peak) and high-intensity (>80% VO2peak) efforts [29].",195aae04-03c1-49dc-9e44-c8991bb2f92f
34,methods34," However, with prolonged KD consumption, certain metabolic adaptations are observed: in the short term (5–10 days), decreased glycogen and active form of pyruvate dehydrogenase and increased intramuscular triglycerides, hormone sensitive lipase, fatty acid translocase, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase; in the medium term (3–6 weeks), consolidation of the short-term metabolic adaptation; and/or in the long term (>3–4 months), it is unclear whether additional changes are possible than those already obtained during the medium-term period. Although training capacity/well-being and performance in moderate training intensity (<70% VO2peak) stabilise after an initial decrease, their continued deterioration may be observed at higher intensities [29].  The unquestionable strength of our study is the novel exploration of how sex influences the effects of consuming a KD: we observed that males and females responded differently to consuming a KD.",8a622657-864c-435e-9681-c08dc33a3501
35,methods35," It has been demonstrated that there may be some sex bias in cohorts included in sport medicine, nutrition, and supplementation research [8,68,69]. Based on our results, it is speculated that there may be certain factors limiting the applicable effectiveness of a KD in females. Moreover, the 4-week KD period was sufficient to obtain the medium-term adaptation necessary for actual assessment of the potential benefits of consuming a KD in functional training [8,29]. Additional strengths of the study are that only regularly trained CrossFitters (≥4 CrossFit training units per week, ≥2 years of CrossFit training experience) participated in this study. Moreover, the applied research methods provide highly accurate and reliable data (e.g., aerobic capacity and discipline-specific performance analyses, monitoring of various blood biomarkers, and diet compliance control).",9ac30587-bcd8-483c-922d-a1015f3103ec
36,methods36," Finally, obtained results may also be extrapolated into other sports disciplines, especially where high-intensity functional training programs are implemented.  Our study has some limitations, which we have thoroughly described and discussed in our previous paper [8]. Briefly, a main limitation is the lack of menstrual cycle phase monitoring and the lack of a control group. Nevertheless, general guidelines on exercise performance across the menstrual cycle cannot be formed [67]. When considering the issue of the lack of a control group, it should be remembered that (a) blinding was impossible because it is difficult to blind a KD; (b) we were interested mainly in the changes before (during CD) and after the implementation of KD model; and (c) the application of a high-carbohydrate diet has been extensively investigated, and it is clear that this nutritional model is efficient and can support exercise performance during functional training [3,6,70,71].",eb70c783-d90b-44b8-9e91-40836ed6075e
37,methods37," Moreover, the individual variation in vulnerability to consuming a KD and the willingness to continue consuming a KD should be taken into consideration when prescribing a KD. The limitation of the current study is also a low number of male participants (n = 5 or 6 depending on the parameter) included in the statistical analysis of blood parameters and results within each Fight Gone Bad (FGB) round (for those participants, the repetitions from all stations and all rounds were recorded together). To avoid misleading conclusions, we tested all blood parameter data in males using nonparametric statistical tests. Moreover, the results of these analyses were interpreted with caution. Finally, we hypothesise that the lack of an increase in aerobic capacity during a 4-week training cycle, or even an observed tendency to decrease especially in females, discredits, to a large extent, this nutritional model as a means to effectively support high-intensity functional training.",e3785145-474a-42e9-aa56-d27a72d4e56d
38,methods38," However, it refers to training targeted toward increasing the potential of physical adaptation and exercise performance.  5. Conclusions  Consuming a KD has no advantage in CrossFit training with respect to aerobic capacity and discipline-specific performance. Compared with a baseline customary diet, a 4-week KD slightly impaired aerobic capacity in females, but not in males. Regardless of sex, consuming a KD had no vital effect on discipline-specific performance (despite certain box jump improvement). In addition, the pre-exercise bilirubin concentration was elevated in the entire group after consuming a KD. A KD may also contribute to increased risk of certain haematological disturbances in female CrossFit athletes. In males, there was an undesirable AlAT elevation with a small tendency towards improved acid–base balance. In summary, we cannot recommend consuming a KD as an effective nutritional strategy in functional training aimed at improving athletic performance.",40c7bf63-d06b-40ba-aa57-5498f8aadb0a
39,methods39," Furthermore, when adhering to a KD, haematological markers in female athletes and liver function status in male athletes should be monitored. However, our study also demonstrated that training while consuming a KD is practically possible and is not associated with the occurrence of any severe disruption in homeostasis as evaluated on the basis of blood testing or the lack of spectacular aerobic adaptation or exercise performance decrease.
