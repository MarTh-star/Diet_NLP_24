0,introduction0," Ketogenic diet therapies (Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT)) are a group of high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets used as a treatment option for drug-resistant epilepsy. Designed to mimic the effects of starvation on the body, fat is utilized as the principle energy source through production of ketones. Children with drug-resistant epilepsy treated with Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) have a relative risk of 3.16 of achieving seizure freedom, and a relative risk of 5.80 of achieving ≥50% seizure reduction compared to usual care (1).  Over the past decade, reports have increased of use of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) in acute situations, in particular for super refractory status epilepticus (super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE)).",733cc4b4-3685-4989-9ac2-bcbf2d166b04
1,introduction1," super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), which is defined as status epilepticus (SE) that continues for at least 24 h after initiation of general anesthesia or that recurs after anesthesia reduction/withdrawal (2), is associated with high morbidity and a mortality rate of >30% (3). Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) is described as “particularly useful” for super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) in international consensus guidelines, being consistently reported as “more beneficial (>70%) than the average 50% Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) response (defined as >50% seizure reduction)” (4). However, most reports of use of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) in children with super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) are from single centres, often only including individuals with single diagnoses, and no attempt to date has been made to collate published results.",3a83bc88-773e-44a7-948c-3a741d6badad
2,introduction2,"  We present a systematic review of the literature of use of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) in children with super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), and describe our experience at a single UK tertiary centre with 8 children with super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) who were started on Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT). We aimed to evaluate feasibility of initiation of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT), safety and short- and long-term effectiveness, and to investigate characteristics associated with efficacy of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) for super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) in the literature.

Quality Appraisal  Study quality was appraised using 12 criteria adapted from the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP)) Cohort Study Checklist. This addresses 10 criteria via the use of 10 questions, plus 2 initial screening questions. Study quality was defined as follows: studies meeting 8–10 criteria were described as “high quality,” studies meeting 5–7 criteria were described as “medium quality,” and studies meeting <5 criteria were described as “low quality.” This approach has been used in previously published systematic reviews (5, 6). No studies were excluded based on Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) score, but rather the tool was used to identify methodological limitations of included studies.",be81e48a-16e8-49df-88a5-9dd350791c10

Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) can be an effective treatment option in the acute stage of super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) although published literature is mostly of medium/low quality and, as in our centre's experience, Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) is not always effective. Long-term outcomes in terms of seizure burden and functional status for children with super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) remain poor.

27,discussion1," Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) may have been successfully implemented in all children in our clinical cohort, as corticosteroids were not given concomitantly, although Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) was started relatively late in the clinical evolution compared to cases in the literature. Details regarding concomitant medications were not given in published studies for those in whom ketosis could not be achieved. Data was also insufficient from the literature review to warrant conclusions to be drawn regarding optimal levels of ketosis. Even when achieved, a consistent level of ketosis may not always be easy to maintain in a critical care setting, due to concomitant carbohydrate-containing medications, corticosteroids, barbiturates, anesthesia or insulin resistance.",501a2fed-d3fe-427c-8222-9c322a299d74
28,discussion2,"  Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) was generally safe to use in this critically-ill cohort, with the majority of adverse side effects being gastrointestinal or an unfavorable lipid profile, which were usually transient or resolved with medical management. Unfavorable lipid profiles have been shown to normalize 6–12 months after starting Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) in non-acute situations, and to return to baseline following diet discontinuation (41, 42). Not all serious adverse side effects reported in the literature were necessarily attributable to Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT), such as sepsis and aspiration pneumonia. Serious adverse side effects that are known to occur with non-acute use of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) for epilepsy, including renal stones, acidosis and hypoglycaemia, seem to occur at a similar (and rare) rate as in acute situations, with an incidence of 1–3% (43), and often in conjunction with ASDs that also increase side effect risk.",fca1c0d0-34fe-4821-b188-b0fa974900ba
29,discussion3,"  Resolution of super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) or seizure cessation rates post-Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) initiation in almost two-thirds of children reported in the literature is certainly promising. However, response is difficult to consistently attribute to Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) due to the variable length of time post-diet initiation that super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) resolved or seizures ceased, together with lack of information regarding treatments started post-Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) start. Resolution of super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) cannot be attributed to Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) in any of the 8 children in our single centre experience, as super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) did not cease until after initiation of other treatments after Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) had been started.",7c642a17-f812-4fad-ac66-5f862685ebd3
30,discussion4," This may have been due to the fact that Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) was started relatively late in the course of super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) in most of the children because of the time taken to determine the effect of treatment with various anti-seizure medications and, in particular, corticosteroids. Other reasons for the apparent discrepancy in response rates between the literature and our centre's experience include potential publication bias against unsuccessful cases, variable definitions of response reported in the literature (clinical observable seizures or electrographic seizures), and the natural course of super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), with remission of SE independent from interventions.",6be673bb-e068-4d2c-89ae-77d7578f1e72
31,discussion5,"  Our analysis of per-patient data from the literature revealed that earlier initiation of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) and female gender were associated with increased likelihood of resolution of super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) post-Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) initiation. Greater response rates with early initiation may be due to the natural course of super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), with the less refractory cases being over-represented. Differing response rates with gender may be associated with particular super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) etiologies, or may be a chance finding, particularly as the number of cases with Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) response and gender data was limited.",100a01c3-0969-48f0-bfa1-7a9ea0cf9a51
32,discussion6," Barriers to early implementation of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) in acute settings may include a lack of familiarity amongst neurologists regarding Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) as a treatment option, the need for propofol infusion, contraindicated with use of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) (44), time taken to obtain results of metabolic investigations excluding the possibility of fatty-acid beta-oxidation disorders and, in some centres, a lack of trained, specialist dietitians. Despite cautiously optimistic efficacy rates, the majority of survivors continued to have drug-resistant seizures in the longer term. Functional outcomes also appear poor, with <10% returning to “normal” or baseline, but relevant data are lacking in the literature. Poor seizure-related and functional outcome may be related to “late” cessation of SE [earlier cessation is associated with better outcomes (45)] and are likely linked to super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) etiology.",ed99e3c5-d55a-4991-8b15-3c083e1cff35
33,discussion7,"  There are several limitations of this review. No randomized controlled trials were identified—studies were all observational, mostly retrospective, cohort studies or case reports/series and predominantly of medium or low quality. No studies compared Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) to no change in treatment although, considering the high mortality and morbidity of super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), clinicians are faced with the question of starting Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) or trying another ASD or alternative seizure treatment and high-quality evidence comparing these two treatment options may be more appropriate. Details regarding timings of other treatments initiated and discontinued, both before, during and after Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT), were limited, which may have impacted diet efficacy rates. Furthermore, few publications provided details regarding long-term functional outcome.",2b403372-eddf-447f-95a8-86da32bb70a0
34,discussion8," More children with super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) have been treated with Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) and are published in the literature, but without age-specific diet efficacy data and so have not been included in this review, such as Worden et al. (46). Alongside this data collection bias, publication bias against negative results must also be considered. The single-centre case note review is limited by the nature of retrospective data collection, in particular missing data regarding initiation and discontinuation dates of ASDs and other treatments.  In conclusion, evidence for efficacy of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) for the treatment of super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) is limited, with low quality data suggestive of benefits. The timing of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) induction earlier in the course of super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) may well be crucial for its efficacy.",d2190b63-e71b-4b5d-8332-76a1758d81df
35,discussion9," Prospective data (including detailed information on concomitant treatments) using a standardized agreed protocol are required to confirm this. Serious adverse side effects are rare, but close monitoring is needed.
