0,background0,"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health problem [1] and incurs enormous indirect and direct healthcare costs [2]. All current clinical guidelines recommend non-surgical non-drug treatments for first-line management of OA, including education/advice, exercise, and, if appropriate, weight loss [3, 4]. However, there is evidence that a substantial proportion of people with OA in Australia are not receiving recommended care [5]. For example, although surgery is only recommended for those with severe symptomatic OA who do not respond to conservative management approaches, data from an Australian hospital found that 33% of people referred for orthopaedic management had not engaged in any non-drug conservative management methods [6]. From 2005 to 06 to 2015–16, Australia has seen a 38% rise in the rate of total knee replacements for OA [7], yet 20% of people undergoing knee replacement surgery report unsatisfactory outcomes [8].",348001a4-7856-46ac-af39-393b53501db3
1,background1," Given that the prevalence of knee OA is projected to rise in the coming decades [2, 9], there is an urgent need to increase uptake of recommended conservative management options through implementation of effective, accessible and scalable models of service delivery.  The benefits of therapeutic exercise for people with knee OA are well-established [10], with similar efficacy to analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but with fewer side-effects [11, 12], and with fewer risks than joint replacement surgery. Given that muscle weakness is common amongst people with OA [13], muscular strengthening exercises are important and can help reduce pain, and improve physical function [14]. In addition, as most people with OA do not meet physical activity recommendations [15], advice to increase physical activity is also important.",97b25cd2-cfa6-4b32-8f29-73e1f2f6cc3e
2,background2," For example, research has demonstrated that people with knee OA who are less sedentary have better physical function, independent of time spent doing moderate or vigorous physical activity [16, 17], and that a threshold of 6000 steps per day discriminates between people with knee OA who do and do not develop functional limitations 2 years later [18].  Given that people with OA who are overweight or obese tend to experience more severe symptoms [19, 20] and are more likely to undergo joint replacement surgery [21], weight loss is an important component of management. However, although weight loss is recommended by evidence-based guidelines [4, 22, 23] there is only limited evidence to support its efficacy in improving symptoms of pain and dysfunction. In the literature, interventions often combine both exercise and weight loss components, making it difficult to identify the independent effects of weight loss on outcomes.",f7cb038c-55ed-417a-b2bd-7e66cb38c3b4
3,background3," One pivotal trial involving 454 overweight and obese adults with knee OA investigated the effects of an intensive diet program, with and without exercise, conducted in a rigorously monitored environment [24]. The combined diet and exercise group lost approximately 10% of body weight, compared to 2% in the exercise only group, leading to reduced knee loads and inflammation compared to the exercise only group. While statistically significant benefits on pain (1-point difference (95% confidence interval: 0.3 to 1.7) on 20-point scale) and function (4.3-point difference (2.1 to 6.5) on 68-point scale) were also seen, the magnitude of these benefits are small and may be of questionable clinical importance. Furthermore, although the diet and exercise intervention was reported to be more cost-effective than usual care (pharmacological NSAIDs regimen followed by total knee replacement surgery) [25], the cost-effectiveness analyses did not include data from the exercise only group.",8c3e760f-6472-4c68-9329-8c0584941fe2
4,background4," Thus, it remains unknown whether a combined intervention of diet and exercise is more cost-effective than exercise alone.  Although the findings of Messier and colleagues [24] support the efficacy of combined weight loss and exercise programs, their interventions were time-intensive and potentially costly, with the weight loss component involving 12 individual and 42 group sessions for nutrition education and behavioural support over 18-months, and the exercise component involving three group exercise sessions per week for 6-months. Given that many barriers to self-management of OA relate to inaccessibility and/or costs of healthcare [26, 27], implementation of such an intensive program outside of a research setting is likely to be difficult in most community or hospital settings, either public or private, without considerable cost and time burdens. Identifying effective programs that minimise active involvement by clinicians is therefore important.",c96b3bfb-f84c-4ab9-8abc-c4ce5dea9b00
5,background5," One way in which to improve the accessibility and scalability of care is to provide it remotely via technology (telerehabilitation), allowing patients to consult from their own home or workplace. There is emerging evidence that telerehabilitation for people with musculoskeletal conditions improves pain and function and is equivalent to outcomes following traditional in-person consultations [28]. More recently, there is evidence that exercise advice and prescription delivered by physiotherapists via videoconferencing leads to improvements in pain and function in people with knee OA [29]. Importantly, such a service is also acceptable to both the people with knee pain receiving care and the physiotherapists delivering it [30]. Similarly, dietary interventions for weight loss can also be effective when delivered remotely. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that dietary interventions for people with chronic diseases (i.e.",2dd18c18-11d2-4041-8abc-79385b7d445a
6,background6," obesity, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, or kidney disease) delivered by dietitians or nurses via video or telephone improved diet quality and led to significant weight loss and reduced waist circumference [31]. No previous studies have investigated the effectiveness of remotely-delivered exercise and weight management programs by physiotherapists and dietitians for people with knee OA who are overweight or obese.  For many people with OA, undertaking an exercise and/or weight management program requires considerable changes in lifestyle behaviours over prolonged periods of time. As such, it is important that intervention development is underpinned by behaviour change theory, and informed by best practice in chronic disease management and self-management support programs. Interventions must include provision of high quality information. However, education alone is insufficient to support behavioural change.",19f4c385-993f-47df-a063-ea13e6a6cdcc
7,background7," Healthcare clinicians must also have the communication and psychosocial skills necessary to facilitate long-term changes in behaviour [32, 33]. Incorporating behavioural counselling [34, 35] and specific behaviour change techniques that are effective for supporting change in exercise and eating behaviours in this population [36] into intervention design will facilitate participants to achieve and sustain effective self-management practices in the long-term.  The aim of this study, conducted in a private health insurance setting, is to compare the effectiveness of two remotely-delivered, evidence- and theory-informed, behaviour change interventions to provide information and behaviour change support for i) exercise and; ii) exercise plus weight management, to each other, and to an information-only control for people with knee OA who are overweight or obese.",3cdaadf3-c8c7-4757-bea5-3e27e58ba716
8,background8," We hypothesise that the exercise plus weight management intervention will lead to greater improvements in pain and function than the exercise intervention and that both interventions will be more effective than information only.

Intervention design Design of the interventions is underpinned by the Chronic Care model [41], recommendations for design and evaluation of self-management support programs [33], and the information-motivation-behavioural skills theoretical model (information motivation behavioural skills theoretical model (IMB)) for behaviour change [42, 43]. The Chronic Care model [41] explains the importance of productive interactions between clinicians with the right skills and patients who are informed and activated. An intervention with the aim of facilitating effective self-management by patients must both activate and then support patient behaviour change.",25336883-e858-458f-9c8c-c9a08e0892b4
19,background19," The information motivation behavioural skills theoretical model (IMB) model contends that although information is a pre-requisite for change, on its own information will not activate change [44]. The model explains that having the motivation to change, and the behavioural skills needed in order to change, are independent and essential determinants [43]. Other interventions based on this model have been effective in influencing behavioural change across a variety of clinical applications [45]. This model of change is consistent with the recommendation that in order to be effective, self-management support programs must include motivational coaching interventions as well as educational interventions that link knowledge with skills [33].",326a7ef3-b882-4966-9e56-17b6cd993f82
20,background20,"  Two recent systematic reviews support the effectiveness of coaching interventions, such as Motivational Interviewing, for managing chronic conditions [35] and chronic painful musculoskeletal conditions [34], specifically in regard to increasing physical activity behaviours. Coaching from clinicians must be patient-centred and tailored to the needs and concerns of the individual [33]. Training and protocols for the clinicians are important intervention components, especially since these coaching skills are not often taught during entry to practice training for health professionals and both clinicians and trainees report skills deficits in this area [46]. In addition to being able to effectively deliver high quality information to facilitate desired behaviour change, clinicians also need to incorporate specific behaviour change techniques such as shared decision-making, goal setting, problem solving, confidence building, review and reinforcement.",4b4b2928-8875-48cf-809a-bd411fc2d720
21,background21," Additional techniques that have been shown to be effective for supporting change in exercise and eating behaviours and that are included in the interventions include providing information about the consequences of the behaviour, encouraging social support, phased action planning, self-monitoring, graded tasks, reinforcing successful behaviour, prompting focus on past success, providing feedback about the participant’s behaviour, barrier identification, and relapse prevention/coping planning [36].  The intervention design is additionally based on best practice recommendations for management of knee OA [3, 4] and obesity [39, 47], plus exercise and weight loss interventions with proven effectiveness.

39,background39,"  Exercise plus weight management intervention Participants who are allocated to the Exercise plus weight management intervention receive all components of the Exercise intervention plus 6 individual videoconferencing consultations with a dietitian (over 6 months) who helps the participant undertake a weight management program involving a ketogenic very low calorie diet (very low calorie diet (VLCD)) [50]. This diet was chosen as it has been shown to lead to greater weight loss in the short-term when compared to low-fat diets [51, 52] and the release of ketones, produced by the liver during fatty acid oxidation while fasting or on a diet that restricts carbohydrates, can help suppress appetite and contribute to further weight loss [50]. Participants are provided with Optifast® meal replacements (Nestlé Health Science, Rhodes, Australia) (or Optislim® [OptiPharm Pty Ltd.",8da32d4b-564c-4bc9-8539-f45af6f5c921

Participants are encouraged to lose at least 10% or more of their body weight, as this has been associated with clinically important improvements in pain [53, 54].  In addition to the five educational booklets provided in the Exercise intervention, participants in the Exercise plus weight management intervention are provided with four additional booklets (described in Table 2). Participants are also mailed a plastic “portion plate” (https://www.nestle.com.au/nhw/nestle-portion-plates) to help them manage meal portion sizes. A short educational video about the very low calorie diet (VLCD) featuring endocrinologists and dietitian experts, and a person with knee OA, is also available on the study website.",2619988a-c6ca-4cc4-8892-46d5349c8844
41,background41,"  Participants’ first consultation with the dietitian takes place within the same week as their first physiotherapist consultation and is approximately 45 min in duration, with follow-up consultations approximately 20 min. During the initial consultation, appropriate weight loss goals, including a target weight, and a management plan are developed. Participants are encouraged to commence the very low calorie diet (VLCD), however they are also able to commence a modified version of the diet (e.g. one meal replacement only) if deemed necessary (e.g. if they do not like the meal replacements or are having difficulty adhering). Participants are asked to weigh themselves weekly and record their progress in their log book. During subsequent consultations, dietitians discuss progress and use motivational interviewing principles and techniques to assist motivation [35], self-efficacy, and overcoming obstacles to completing the agreed self-management plan.",a078935f-7336-4acb-9f6b-8dae7273e793
42,background42," Dietitians also guide participants through the resource booklets provided, including activities to help them adhere to their self-management plan such as planning for unforeseen events (e.g. eating out) and choosing a support person. Once the participant has reached their target weight, they can choose whether to transition to a weight maintenance phase or continue with the very low calorie diet (VLCD) program and aim for further weight loss.  The very low calorie diet (VLCD) involves replacing two meals, generally breakfast and lunch, with meal replacements. Very low calorie diet meal replacement products are formulated to provide the adequate micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, and metals), and come as bars, shakes, or soups in a variety of flavours. On the diet, one meal (generally dinner) comprises protein (e.g. white or red meat, fish or seafood, eggs, or tofu) and non-starchy vegetables/salad. A small amount (i.e.",de672a9c-3698-442b-ae62-98047afb0957
43,background43," 1 tablespoon) of oil/fat is also recommended for this meal to reduce the risk of gallstone formation. In total, the diet contains approximately 800 cal (3280 kJ).  Transitioning off the very low calorie diet (VLCD) (after target weight is reached) is done by reintroducing foods containing carbohydrates and moving to only one meal replacement per day. This transition phase usually lasts at least 2 weeks, after which participants commence a healthy eating diet which is consistent with the principles of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)) total wellbeing diet [55] (i.e. high protein, low glycaemic index carbohydrate, low fat). Participants are encouraged to weigh themselves regularly thereafter (e.g. once per week). Participants who regain 2 kg or more are advised to restart the very low calorie diet (VLCD) with meal replacements for 1–2 weeks.",3e3eb1f9-27ec-4e1f-aa51-5d1e8e91a468

Dietitians and physiotherapists are also encouraged to communicate with each other through their consultation notes (e.g. to flag any important issues that the participant might be having). To reduce the risk of loss of muscle mass during their weight management program, physiotherapists also recommend that participants in this group complete regular arm strengthening exercises (Table 3) in addition to their leg strengthening program.

Physiotherapist selection criteria includes having experience managing people with chronic diseases, specifically knee OA, and current registration with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. Five accredited dietitians, with at least 2 years of clinical experience and some experience assisting people with weight loss, are employed to deliver the weight management intervention.

Case studies presented during trained are designed to replicate potential scenarios anticipated to arise during the trial. Following these first two training days, clinicians conduct an initial and follow-up video consultation with a practice participant (one per clinician) to practice using their motivational interviewing skills and recording consultation notes.",823bf180-94e0-4c1d-acd7-522524895ee0

Group level feedback is provided to clinicians at a half day workshop approximately 1 month after the initial two training days;  iii) very low calorie diet (VLCD): dietitians attend a 1-h webinar delivered by the research team on the specifics of the very low calorie diet (VLCD). Physiotherapists are asked to watch the video recording of the presentation.  iv) study-specific protocols: dietitians and physiotherapists attend a 1–2 h session (supplemented by detailed study treatment manuals) to ensure clinicians were familiar with all study procedures and processes. All clinicians are provided with a hardcopy of the study manual as well as hardcopies of all participant booklets to aid discussions during consultations.,4e33b1f1-446d-4aa2-afbc-5730c993c5ec
48,background48,"    Treatment fidelity After the trial commences, clinicians are able to discuss with the research team via phone or email any issues with delivering the intervention as planned, including using the motivational interviewing principles. Regular meetings are held with all clinicians and the trial team to discuss any issues or provide feedback. All consultations are audio-recorded and a random subset will be audited for fidelity using the MITI 4.2.1. Fidelity is also evaluated by auditing the electronic treatment notes, which includes details of participant management plans (e.g. the exercises prescribed and dietary plans).  Dealing with adverse events Expected adverse events include: i) transient increase in knee pain or swelling due to increased exercise or physical activity; ii) feeling hungry, fatigued, fuzzy-headed, and/or having headaches, and either diarrhoea or constipation during the first week after commencing the very low calorie diet (VLCD).",ebc3d911-0579-4810-bafd-b9161d787a4a

If necessary, treatment is discontinued and further medical advice is arranged. Adverse events are also collected via self-report in the 6- and 12-month questionnaires.  Clinicians are instructed to report any adverse events to the trial coordinator, record the event in their consultation notes, and refer participants to their general practitioner if necessary. Participants are provided with a “help” email address to contact if they have any issues with their exercise/physical activity or weight management program in between consultations.

76,methods0,"Three-arm, pragmatic parallel-design randomised controlled trial involving 415 people aged ≥45 and ≤ 80 years, with body mass index ≥28 kg/m2 and < 41 kg/m2 and painful knee osteoarthritis. Recruitment is Australia-wide amongst Medibank private health insurance members. All three groups receive access to a bespoke website containing information about osteoarthritis and self-management. Participants in the Exercise group also receive six consultations with a physiotherapist via videoconferencing over 6 months, including prescription of a strengthening exercise and physical activity program, advice about management, and additional educational resources. The Exercise plus weight management group receive six consultations with a dietitian via videoconferencing over 6 months, which include a very low calorie ketogenic diet with meal replacements and resources to support behaviour change, in addition to the interventions of the Exercise group.",382f11b9-067c-4d11-910c-a0939d6928dc
77,methods1," Outcomes are measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Primary outcomes are self-reported knee pain and physical function at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include weight, physical activity levels, quality of life, global rating of change, satisfaction with care, knee surgery and/or appointments with an orthopaedic surgeon, and willingness to undergo surgery. Additional measures include adherence, adverse events, self-efficacy, and perceived usefulness of intervention components. Cost-effectiveness of each intervention will also be assessed.

78,discussion0,"With the rapidly rising burden of knee OA, there is an urgent need for interventions that improve outcomes and that are also widely accessible to people in rural, regional, and metropolitan communities [89]. Although the effectiveness of exercise therapy on pain and function is well-established, there is relatively limited robust evidence about the additional benefits of weight loss in people with knee OA [4].  This trial will be the first to investigate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of a remotely delivered service combining dietary weight management and exercise, compared to a service involving exercise only and to an online information-only control group. Such a service has the potential to be a low-cost and accessible way in which people with OA can receive care, thus potentially increasing uptake of recommended management methods, like weight loss and exercise.",1b3d7638-cdd5-4068-804f-8aa01b5194e3
79,discussion1," Findings from this study will inform healthcare providers about the effects of incorporating weight loss components into exercise interventions. Moderator analyses using data from this study will also allow us to determine whether specific sub-groups of participants are more likely to respond to these remotely delivered services, which will allow health service providers to better target interventions to those that would benefit most. Qualitative explorations will provide insight into the feasibility and viability of implementing similar weight management programs into private and public healthcare settings from the perspective of both the participants receiving care, as well as the clinicians involved in delivering it.  A potential limitation of this trial is the targeted sample of participants, including only those who are Medibank Private members with a level of membership that includes arthroplasty surgery.",04e602d0-fbee-4df6-9937-956f0bab6cf7
