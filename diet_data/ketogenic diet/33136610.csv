6,methods7," However, at week 16, only the high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS) had significantly higher blood insulin levels than the SC group (Table 4). In fact, the high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS) diet-induced elevation in blood insulin concentration was 79%, relative to the SC animals (Table 4), which is an indication of insulin-resistance in these animals. In contrast, the SC and KD groups did not have statistically significantly different blood insulin levels at week 16 (Table 4).  3.1. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 Levels in Lung and Heart Tissues  We extracted lung and heart tissues from the animals for measurement of SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2. The high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS) diet increased lung ACE2 content 3.8- and 6-fold, when compared to the SC and KD groups, respectively (Figure 1A). A similar pattern was observed for TMPRSS2 where, for the high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS) diet, the levels of this protein increased by 5.1- and 3.",44760796-3e46-4cce-a40f-972fc66ca272

However, in cardiac tissue, no significant differences were detected for ACE2 or TMPRSS2 levels when comparing the different dietary interventions (Figure 1C,D, respectively). These data indicate that the high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS) diet increased SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins in lung tissue, but not in the heart.  3.2. ACE1, AT1R, and AT2R Levels in Lung and Heart Tissues  In pulmonary tissue, the KD attenuated ACE1 protein content by 56%, relative to the SC group (Figure 2A). Furthermore, KD also reduced AT1R protein content in this tissue; however, it was not statistically significant (Figure 2C). Pulmonary AT2R levels were not altered by diet either (Figure 2E). In cardiac tissue, ACE1 was not significantly different among the groups (Figure 2B). However, the high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS) diet induced 2.6 and 4.",d61279a5-c08f-4cd0-a540-2700bebbd34c
8,methods9,"9-fold increases in AT1R (Figure 2D) and AT2R (Figure 2F) levels, respectively, when compared to the SC group. The contents of these proteins were not significantly different between the SC- and KD-fed animals.  3.3. Comparison of ACE1, ACE2, AT1R, and AT2R in lung and Heart Tissues  Upon observing the diet-induced changes in renin angiotensin system (RAS) proteins and the tissue-specific nature of these changes, we then decided to compare the contents of ACE1, ACE2, AT1R, and AT2R in the lungs and heart. Pulmonary tissue displayed higher levels of ACE1 than cardiac tissue (Figure 3), whereas more ACE2, AT1R, and AT2R was found in the heart than in the lungs. (Figure 3).  3.4. Gene Expressions of Mas1, tlr4, il6r, and tnfr1 in Lung and Heart Tissues  The gene expression of mas1 was not significantly different among any of the three dietary interventions in either lung (Figure 4A) or heart tissue (Figure 4E).",2ea7a6e5-0d8a-4405-aa6b-a490d3741c92
9,methods10," However, the gene expressions of tlr4 and il6r were significantly reduced by 74% and 79%, respectively, in the lungs of KD-fed animals, when compared to the high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS) animals (Figure 4B,C, respectively). KD also suppressed tnfr1 gene expression in this tissue by ~73% (Figure 4D), although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.059). In the heart, no significant differences were found for tlr4, il6r, and tnfr1 gene expressions among the three diet groups (Figure 4F–H, respectively). Altogether, these results indicate that the KD exerted an anti-inflammatory effect in the lungs, but not in the heart.  4. Discussion  Here, we show that obesogenic and ketogenic diets regulate in a distinct and tissue-specific manner proteins of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), as well as major components of the molecular machinery involved in cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2.",6f61e2be-eab3-46af-9f6a-c10a105586a3
10,methods11," In fact, rats fed the high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS) obesogenic diet displayed elevated insulinemia and much higher levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lungs than animals fed either SC or a KD. This is consistent with previous findings of increased lung levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in diabetic mice [7], and with reports linking insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes to severe COVID outcomes [2,7]. However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to show that besides attenuating weight gain and insulinemia, a KD maintained lower ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein levels in the lungs in comparison to a high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS) diet. This is relevant for the prevention of severe COVID-19-related illness, given that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have been identified as crucial components of the molecular machinery used by SARS-CoV-2 to infects cells [5].",8367940b-2ab7-4c8e-b645-2b630087110e
11,methods12," In fact, use of the specific TMPRSS2 inhibitor, camostat mesylate, has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry in Caco-2 cells, and anti-ACE2 antibody incubation with Vero cells blocked SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 entry [5]. Thus, the observed elevation in these two proteins in the lungs of high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS)-fed rats provides a plausible mechanism whereby obese individuals are more susceptible to severe infection with SARS-CoV-2. The underlying mechanisms that explain this diet-induced elevation in ACE2 have not been fully elucidated [17]. However, under conditions of obesity, adipose tissue secretes angiotensinogen, which can eventually be converted to Ang-II, leading to hyperactivation of the ACE1/Ang-II/AT1R arm of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and subsequent tissue damage [2,8]. Hyperinsulinemia may also cause renin angiotensin system (RAS) dysregulation [8].",928116c2-dd28-4e05-b8b7-b5afc945a3c4
12,methods13," In this context, the observed elevation in ACE2 is likely a counterregulatory mechanism to attenuate the detrimental effects induced by obesity-mediated renin angiotensin system (RAS) hyperactivation [17]. Furthermore, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) is a major comorbidity of obesity, and it has been linked to increased hepatic expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [18], which could contribute to the aggravate morbidity in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Importantly, ketogenic diets have been shown to be very effective in combating non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [19,20,21] and attenuate the potential deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the liver. However, we did not assess any variable associated with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in our studies; therefore, we could not make any inferences about hepatic expression of SARS-CoV-2 critical entry points.",896370c2-184b-4696-ab87-5ea95592b0cd
13,methods14,"  Although there were no significant alterations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the heart with any of the dietary interventions, ACE2 was found to be more abundant in cardiac than in lung tissue. Thus, because the obesogenic diet significantly increased ACE2 in the lungs, COVID-19 infection still poses a significant risk for cardiac health in obese individuals, since it is one of the primary points of infection. This could potentially enhance the severity of the infection in pulmonary tissues, leading to viral spill over, whereby the virus can access other tissues, including the heart, which is already abundant in ACE2 and, as a result, predisposed to infection and damage [2,6]. The roles of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the renin angiotensin system (RAS), are not independent. Thus, the other renin angiotensin system (RAS) components are also emerging as therapeutic targets to treat illness related to COVID-19.",f65d9b2a-80a1-4412-80f2-e2e5df6e2022
14,methods15," In fact, the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)) or ACE inhibitors have been proposed as treatments for SARS-CoV-2 patients [2]. This serves to increase flux through the ACE2/Ang(1,7)/MasR and AT2R arm of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and to promote anti-inflammatory mechanisms that counteract the COVID-induced cytokine storm [2,6,8]. In the present study, we observed no alteration in AT1R or AT2R in lung tissues with any of the three dietary interventions. However, the KD did significantly reduce ACE1 levels. This indicates that the renin angiotensin system (RAS) system was shifted away from the ACE1/Ang-II/AT1R arm and towards the counterregulatory, anti-inflammatory renin angiotensin system (RAS) arm, given that we also observed reductions in tlr4, and il6r gene expressions, as well as a trend to decrease tnfr1 gene expression.",c5b013c3-2a65-4a2e-93f1-35f4b8583c6d
15,methods16," The observed reduction in the expression of these inflammatory genes is relevant, as IL-6 and TNFα are two major cytokines that facilitate the coronavirus-induced cytokine storm [2]. Furthermore, Zhao et al. demonstrated that TLR4 inhibition suppressed interleukin-1β release in cells treated with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein [22].  Our findings are in line with other studies that report the anti-inflammatory nature of the KD [13,23], and suggest that this diet could reduce the risk of severe infection and inflammatory response related to COVID-19. We have not investigated the mechanism by which the KD led to lower levels of expression of inflammatory genes in comparison to the obesogenic diet. However, the KD is characterized by increased liver production of ketones [24]. Thus, the anti-inflammatory effect of the KD could be at least partially attributed to increased levels of circulating ketones, particularly β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB), upon KD feeding [25].",864b3ca9-41c9-4eea-8751-e662d7bdb168
16,methods17," In fact, β-HB has been demonstrated to block the nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich-containing family pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 production by monocytes [26]. Additionally, the KD has been shown to exert its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation, suppressing the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs), reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), and by improving mitochondrial respiration [24]. Thus, all these KD effects can ameliorate chronic low-grade inflammation and its associated diseases. It is important to mention that the KD used in this study was completely devoid of carbohydrates, which differs from the commonly used KD that recommends low carbohydrate content (less than 50 g/day) and not the complete elimination of this macronutrient from the diet [27].",260d7b27-00b1-4805-a4dd-e41fe2b9469c
17,methods18," Thus, caution should be taken when extrapolating our findings to human subjects. However, the absence of carbohydrates in the diet allowed us to identify that it is the combination of HF with sucrose, as opposed to HF alone, that promotes the deleterious metabolic effects associated with increased levels of SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins and inflammation in lung and heart tissues in obesity.  We did not find any significant difference in the cardiac gene expressions of Mas1 or the aforementioned inflammatory genes, although a trend to increase the latter in the high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS)-fed rats was detected. However, the high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS) diet did increase AT1R content, which was also met by a similar increase in AT2R. This likely served to offset the proinflammatory response mediated by AT1R. Indeed, it has been reported that AT2R increases in response to AT1R hyperactivation and injury [2,11].",7b2d172f-5e1e-4005-927b-7c8d1cf1d551
18,methods19," Interestingly, AT1R and AT2R are more abundant in the heart than in the lungs. In this context, it is possible that the elevated expression of these receptors allows for an enhanced flexibility of this tissue to regulate its inflammatory status. It is important to note that AT1R and AT2R levels did not change in the hearts of KD-fed animals, relative to the SC animals, suggesting that this diet did not provoke renin angiotensin system (RAS) activation. Unlike the lungs, heart ACE1 content was not altered by diet. This could be attributed to the lower ACE1 content in the heart, compared to the lungs, suggesting that the reliance of the former on ACE1 for renin angiotensin system (RAS) regulation is lower than the latter, where there was a diet-induced alteration in the content of this protein. This is consistent with the notion that the ACE1-dependent conversion of Ang-I to Ang-II takes place predominantly in pulmonary circulation [10].",df00b519-5ceb-47da-9a29-7fe931c6fb6c
19,methods20,"  In conclusion, these data indicate that the high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS) diet increases body weight, insulinemia renin angiotensin system (RAS) hyperactivation and lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which could explain the predisposition of obese individuals to severe COVID-19 outcomes. In contrast, the KD did not elicit the same elevations in weight gain and insulinemia as the high fat sucrose enriched diet (HFS) diet did. Our data also suggests that there is not a hyperactivation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in KD-fed animals, as indicated by the reductions in pulmonary ACE1 and the expressions of inflammatory genes, as well as unaltered cardiac AT1R and AT2R contents. Thus, a counterregulatory elevation in lung ACE2 was not observed in KD animals.",5fe004b8-2523-4f4c-9f63-17ad18db5a7c
20,methods21," Unlike the lungs, the heart does not experience a diet-induced alteration in ACE2, however the abundance of this protein, relative to the lungs, makes it a susceptible organ to SARS-CoV-2 damage, following viral spill over from pulmonary tissues. In this context, despite altering renin angiotensin system (RAS) proteins in a tissue-specific manner, it is clear that the KD offers a promising potential therapeutic tool for its reduction in SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins and its induction of an anti-inflammatory profile.
