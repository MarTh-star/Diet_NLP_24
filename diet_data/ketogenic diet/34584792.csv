0,background0," Ketogenic diets are a commonly used weight loss method, but little is known how variations in sodium content and ketones influence cognition and mood during the early keto-adaptation period.  Objectives  To investigate the effects of an exogenous ketone salt (KS) as part of a hypocaloric KD on mood and cognitive outcomes in overweight and obese adults. A secondary objective was to evaluate changes in biochemical markers associated with inflammatory and cognitive responses. ",1e159a89-e5ac-4b15-92d4-8f23b7cce82f
1,methods0," Study design and human participants  The study participants, experimental diet interventions, and body composition results have been previously reported . In brief, this controlled prospective feeding study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. The primary aim was to assess the effects of a KD with exogenous ketone salt supplementation (KD + KS, n = 12, 6 men/6 women) and a KD with a flavor matched placebo (KD + PL, n = 13, 6 men/7 women) on mood, cognition, and related biomarkers. A BMI and age matched group of participants was later assigned to an energy- and protein-matched low-fat diet (low fat (LFD), n = 12). Eligibility was determined based on age (21–65 years) and BMI (27–35 kg/m2).",a61f32a2-1176-40b8-a710-6306e1f4beb1
2,methods1," Exclusion criteria included: >10% weight loss in the 6-month period prior to enrollment, endocrine disfunction, drug use, smoking, alcoholism, epilepsy, headaches, pregnancy, usage of antibiotic/antifungal medication, or if currently on a ketogenic diet. Eligible participants completed a food frequency questionnaire, medical history questionnaire, and a physical activity questionnaire before they signed an informed consent document approved by the Ohio State University institutional review board (IRB #2017H0395). There were no significant differences between groups in baseline characteristics (Table 1).  TABLE 1 Participant characteristics.

3,methods2,"  Diet intervention and ketone supplement  This was a double-blind (both participants and outcome assessors were blinded for the KS portion of the study) controlled feeding study. Study dietitians remained unblinded in order to manage calorie intake of the groups accordingly. All food was prepared in a state-of-the-art metabolic kitchen. All the ingredients were precisely weighed (± 0.1 g), with custom macro- and micronutrients calculated by a team of registered dietitians. Both ketogenic diets were designed based on previous well-formulated standards  and the low fat (LFD) was developed in accordance with the USDA’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015–2020 (United States Dietics Association, 2015).",61a75a18-d3d5-47f8-87f4-b4d6ea02acae
4,methods3," Menus for each participant were calculated from a base calorie level of 2,000 and scaled to match 75% of estimated energy requirements based on assessment of resting energy expenditure measured by indirect calorimetry (ParvoMedics TrueOne, Salt Lake City, UT, United States, v2400), a standard Harris–Benedict equation for estimating energy expenditure, and the energy cost of their physical activity (Harris and Benedict, 1918).  Protein was set at 1.5 g/kg reference weight for all three diets (Metropolitan, 1983). A portion of the protein for the KD groups was provided as two daily chocolate or vanilla shakes that contained whey protein isolate (∼15 g/serving) along with fat in the form of high oleic sunflower oil and medium chain fatty acids (MCT–caprylic and capric acids, Metagenics, Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA, United States). In addition, subjects in KD groups consumed one serving of 10 g MCT oil with their breakfast and one serving in the afternoon snack.",83afdab0-7c79-49f7-8565-9c90d372bae5
5,methods4,"  Both KD groups were provided ∼40 g/day of carbohydrates and the remaining calories were provided as fat, with an emphasis on monounsaturated and saturated fat sources. The low fat (LFD) provided 25% total fat with <10% saturated fat, at least 32 g fiber/day, ∼100 g of simple carbohydrates (<25 g added sugars) and <30 g added oils/day. Ad libitum intake of calorie-free/salt-free products, such as diet soda, non-caloric flavored water, etc., were allowed during the entire intervention. A variety of whole foods were used to develop both the ketogenic and low-fat meals. Average nutrient intakes over the 6 weeks for the three groups were reported previously .  The KD + KS group consumed a ketone supplement consisting of racemic ketone salts (11.8 g BHB with sodium, calcium, and magnesium, Metagenics, Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA, United States) with non-caloric flavoring, shown to acutely increase ketosis in healthy adults (O’Connor et al., 2018).",12489e64-8d36-46b3-8014-cd0f562e6865
6,methods5," Two doses were taken daily, in the morning and after lunch. Because the ketone supplements contained calories in the form of BHB, the fat content of the KD + KS group’s menu was reduced by ∼120 kcal/day to ensure all 3 diets had similar caloric values. The KD + PL and low fat (LFD) groups received a calorie-free flavored placebo that contained no BHB or minerals and was identical in appearance and taste to the ketone supplement to maintain the double-blind nature of the study. Experimental design for the study can be found in Figure 1.  FIGURE 1 Experimental design and macronutrient breakdown for both ketogenic (KD) and low-fat (low fat (LFD)) diet groups.

11,methods10,"  Biochemical analysis  Beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucose levels  Fasting BHB and glucose concentrations [previously reported in Buga et al. (2021)] were assessed in capillary blood using reagent strips and a monitoring device (Abbot FreeStyle®, Columbus, OH, United States). Outside of testing days, participants reported daily fasted ketones every morning during the study via image texts sent to research staff. On testing days, fasting venous blood samples were collected via venipuncture in the antecubital fossa, performed by a qualified phlebotomist.  Adipokine panel  Fasted adipokine biomarkers in human serum (BDNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, Insulin, Leptin, MCP-1, TNF-α, β-NGF) were analyzed using the Meso Scale Discovery’s U-Plex Human Adipokine Panel (Rockford, Maryland).

12,methods11," The electrochemiluminescence detection used labels that emit light when electrochemically stimulated. Multiple excitation cycles of each label amplify the signal to enhance light levels and improve sensitivity. U-Plex linkers are first coupled to biotinylated capture antibody. This solution is used to coat each 10-spot well in the 96-well plate to appropriately bind the sample. Samples were run in duplicates. The addition of the antibody solution was used to couple the markers to each biomarker spot in the well. The plate was analyzed using the MSD Workbench 4.0 software.

Baseline measures were compared for differences with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Two-way repeated measures (RM) ANOVA was used with diet (KD + KS, KD + PL, and low fat (LFD)) and time (weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6) as independent variables.

A main effect of time (p = 0.001) and interaction between diet and time (p = 0.007) were noted, mostly attributed to lower glucose levels in KD + PL when compared to low fat (LFD) group at weeks 2 and 6 (p < 0.01).  All dietary interventions similarly reduced insulin levels across all time points [main effect of time (p < 0.0001), Figure 2C].

24,discussion0," A primary finding in this exploratory study was that there was no indication of a consistent decline in various measures of mood or cognitive function during a short-term 6-week hypocaloric KD, despite being relatively low in sodium relative to a low-fat diet. The addition of a KS to the KD modestly elevated circulating BHB beyond and provided considerably more sodium, which may have contributed to decreased depression scores and higher happiness scores in this group. Specific changes were seen at WK2 behavioral markers showing that KD + PL has significantly higher depression scores and low fat (LFD) reported significantly higher anger scores, compared to KD + KS group. Cognitive performance was generally stable during weight loss across all diets.  Both KD groups reached nutritional ketosis by the first week with BHB levels above 1.0 mM, as reported in Buga et al. (2021) and the ketone salt supplemented group displayed a non-significant trend for slightly higher levels of BHB.",72a064fd-72d9-44e5-b451-38299275314f
25,discussion1," It has previously been reported that the KS used in this investigation acutely and transiently increased BHB to approximately 1.0 mM 1-h after intake, while fasted (O’Connor et al., 2018). Thus, the levels of ketones determined from overnight fasted samples likely underestimate the transient increase in the overall exposure to higher ketosis during the day.  Glucose-lowering is a well-established benefit of ketogenic diets , and this effect was not augmented by the addition of ketone salts. On the other hand, participants that followed the low fat (LFD) showed glucose fluctuations with decreased glucose levels at week 4 that returned to baseline levels at week 6. Higher glucose levels, even within upper range of clinically considered normal values, has been associated with higher risk for dementia onset .",6e16a922-cc92-4dd4-8bfe-dae5790e2d47
26,discussion2," Therefore, lowering and stabilization of fasting glucose levels is a clinically advantageous benefit of KDs that intersects both metabolic and cognitive health. Our findings support the notion that KDs are likely a promising preventative therapeutic approach for individuals at higher risk of developing cognitive impairments via modulation of fasting glucose levels (Huttenlocher, 1976; VanItallie et al., 2005; Crane et al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2018).  Insulin dysregulation plays a key role in cognitive decline in patients with AD (Cholerton et al., 2013; Kellar and Craft, 2020) and psychiatric disorders (Penninx and Lange, 2018) in such a way that peripheral insulin resistance decreases the ability of the hormone to cross the blood brain barrier . We suspected that the hypocaloric nature of this study would reduce insulin levels for all groups , but that KD interventions would further augment the effect.",96101f8b-c7d3-4fc8-a161-0a8715539ca1
27,discussion3," Our results showed that all dietary interventions tested successfully and similarly decreased insulin levels, an effect that was likely attributed to weight-loss and independent of KS inclusion. Likewise, a recent study with type-2 diabetic population following a low-carbohydrate lifestyle reported decreased subclinical depressive symptoms as early as 10 weeks with reductions maintained up to 2 years . While this is a research area of growing interest, limited clinical studies so far have been conducted with this patient population. Emerging areas with clinical interest and mechanistic plausibility for KD as a therapeutic intervention include anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and attention hyperactivity disorder [reviewed in Bostock et al. (2017) and Kovács et al. (2019)].",e2e10366-0f38-496a-a0ef-23e1f8f3a209
28,discussion4,"  We hypothesized that augmentation of ketosis by twice daily ingestion of a KS would facilitate the transition during the keto-adaptation weight loss phase, similarly to what was reported using an MCT-supplemented KD (D C. Harvey et al., 2018). Commonly reported “keto-flu” symptoms include headaches, fatigue, brain fog, decreased energy among others, peaking in the first few days and lasting up to 4 weeks . A key physiological event associated with keto flu symptoms is the initial mineral imbalance that occurs during the keto adaptation phase, which is driven by the natriuretic and diuretic effects of very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets. While KD + PL group met dietary guideline RDA for sodium, previous literature suggests that KDs may require a higher intake of sodium due the natriuretic effects of the diet (O’Donnell et al., 2014; Volek et al., 2021). Hyponatremia has a known association with depressive mood in clinical populations (Fan et al.",5360887e-7aab-492a-9597-586acb16858a
29,discussion5,", 2020; Suárez et al., 2020). Indeed, our findings showed that supplementation with KS containing a proprietary combination of minerals elicited subjective mood amelioration, reflected here as lower depression and higher happiness scores (Figure 3), particularly when compared to subjects following a KD without KS. Moreover, subjects following low fat (LFD) reported higher anger scores at week 2 compared to KD + KS group but no differences between KD groups were seen.  Carbohydrate-restricted diets have been previously associated with fatigue and reduced vigor, particularly in response to exercise, compared to non-ketogenic low-carbohydrate diets. A 2006 study reported unfavorable mood profile, fatigue, and reduced vigor in KD group . There was no mention of sodium content of the KD, reported potassium levels were deficient, and the KD failed to achieve the lower threshold of nutritional ketosis .",3520a77a-94c9-45b5-9880-b15cba348030
30,discussion6," In the current study, we did not observe significant differences in either fatigue or vigor across all three dietary interventions, possibly due to the well-balanced nature of the KD.  The Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) battery of cognitive tests was chosen based on previous evidence that it is a valid and reliable tool to assess cognitive function in military adult population . Our group recently established that high-intensity resistance exercise may elicit domain-specific influences on cognitive function utilizing the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) core test battery . Performance in several tests were improved throughout the 6-week study, showing familiarization, and learning of specific tasks. For instance, reaction time decreased while its scores improved, and code substitution and matching to sample scores improved over time, regardless of dietary group.",493bf6f3-f79a-4696-aa49-81601791fa4d
31,discussion7," Math processing scores were negatively impacted in KD + PL group at the end of the study whereas both KD + KS and low fat (LFD) groups showed consistent scores in this task throughout the 6-week study.  Our findings showed that both low fat (LFD) and KD + KS resulted in consistent performance in tasks that required both attention and visual recognition memory. At week 2, Participants following the low fat (LFD) showed a significant detriment in the go/no-go task which entails response inhibition, an effect that was not observed in either KD dietary intervention group. Most evidence to date supporting the use of ketogenic approaches as a therapeutic option to attenuate cognitive decline has been derived from studies performed in populations with cognitive impairments at baseline or in the presence of another neurological disorder.",de161e49-647b-45e1-81b5-efef149f567b
32,discussion8," Subjects in our study were between 21 and 65 years and cognitively healthy at baseline, which likely explains the slight changes observed in cognitive outcomes and lack of additional benefits of twice-daily KS intake.  The literature on the effects of ketogenic interventions on BDNF have been inconsistent and contradictory, particularly when it comes to comparisons between peripheral or cerebral BDNF levels. Walsh et al. found that after administration of a ketone ester (KE) there was no change in BDNF concentrations in healthy populations but later saw either sustained or increased BDNF following both KE ingestion and an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test in normal and overweight participants (Walsh et al., 2020, 2021). Two studies showed increased BDNF concentrations after a >8-week KD intervention in healthy weight adults .",22186665-a736-4896-bc76-8566aa7de810
33,discussion9," Elevated NGF-β and BDNF concentrations are often discovered in obese populations during metabolic panel screening (Levinger et al., 2008; Atanassova et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2016). Evidence attributes this effect to NGF-β and BDNF overexpression to confer neuroprotective for the central nervous system, thereby mitigating cognitive decline. Weight loss has been linked to a decrease in BDNF levels, returning them to healthy range, which corresponds to the changes that we detected in KD + KS . NGF-β concentrations, on the other hand, were differentially affected by dietary interventions, with fluctuations throughout the experimental procedure but not statistically significant at any of the testing days. Collectively, neuropeptide changes in our intervention were likely attributed to weight-loss rather than diet composition per se.",dc5530ed-4468-483a-ad54-1a64855d7270
34,discussion10," Future studies should consider pre-screening for NGF-b and BDNF to quantify if baseline neuropeptide levels are directly proportional to the magnitude change during an intervention (i.e., higher NGF-b and BDNF concentrations are expected to decrease more over time vs. normal physiological concentrations).  Leptin is one of the most studied adipose-derived hormones and considered an important link between metabolic health, cognitive function and inflammation (Matarese et al., 2005; Warren et al., 2012; Monda et al., 2020). Leptin It is also found to be over-expressed in patients with metabolic syndrome synergistically with overexpression in BDNF and NGF- β (Levinger et al., 2008; Atanassova et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2016). As expected with weight loss, all groups showed a drop in serum leptin throughout the study, however, the magnitude of decline was attenuated in the KS group, particularly when compared to low fat (LFD) leptin levels at week 6.",81594010-4d7a-4b43-bd2a-e344712cb036
35,discussion11," Considering that leptin levels are directly associated with BMI and fat mass and given that no overall metabolic differences were present between the two KD groups regarding weight loss  and changes in liver fat content , we speculate whether the regulatory effect of the KD with adequate mineral intake from the supplement may be the reason for the significant difference in leptin levels between groups. Additional experiments aiming to better understand adipose-tissue responses to chronic supplementation with ketone salts will help elucidate the neuroregulatory and inflammatory mechanisms involved in this pathway.  Of interest, the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α steadily increased in the low fat (LFD) group throughout the study, reaching statistical significance at week 6, compared to both KD groups; a similar non-significant trend was observed for the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine.",3f9e0aa1-878b-4ac2-9d2e-8f6a4210e075
36,discussion12," High systemic TNF-α levels correspond with rapid cognitive decline over 6 months in AD patients, thus dietary modulation of this cytokine should be further investigated . Chronic inflammation in obese populations is a key contributor to elevated TNF -α levels. Weight loss is a typical strategy used to reverse chronic inflammatory responses (Jung and Choi, 2014), but weight loss itself may not be enough to decrease levels in those with comorbidities (Di Francia et al., 1994), therefore the anti-inflammatory nature of the KD may benefit this patient population (Newman and Verdin, 2014; Dupuis et al., 2015).  A considerable strength of our study was that the controlled-feeding design ensured that participants adhered to the assigned dietary approach while daily ketone assessments could be construed as an objective biomarker to track compliance.",72342503-1dbb-4f67-8925-f2d6cd086651
37,discussion13," Moreover, dietary plans were carefully designed by a team of registered dieticians and palatability was a contributing factor in the high adherence observed. One of the common shortcomings of dietary studies is the lack of consistency of meal and ingredient recommendations and our approach successfully addressed this challenge.  The 6-week timeframe was chosen due to successful body weight and metabolic changes observed in previous KD studies and the dietary interventions tested indeed resulted in improved metabolic and body composition findings (Volek et al., 2002; Buga et al., 2021; Crabtree et al., 2021). However, 6 weeks may not have been sufficient to elicit pronounced cognitive changes, particularly in a cognitively healthy adult population. Additionally, it is unclear what the long-term results would suggest if weight-maintenance was attained, given that all the primary outcomes reported in this publication have been collected during consistent, bi-weekly weight-loss.",0a9014fe-0a5e-4e51-85a6-7492cefb6074
38,discussion14," Despite slight amelioration of mood outcomes, KS did not significantly or consistently impact cognitive function, likely due to its modest and transient increase in circulating BHB levels. Further research is needed with the addition of a KD with sodium matched levels of the KD + KS group, without the addition of ketones. This may prevent outcomes associated specifically with higher ketone levels as sodium levels were also increased.  The cognitive battery in this study may have limitations. Firstly, the only available normative data for the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) is from a military sample set. Although, we have previously used Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) in general population research, normative scores were not calculated for this sample.",2a2cfd5d-13a5-4ddf-af75-a81fe53cf798
39,discussion15," Lastly, even considering the test–retest reliability for Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) is positive, taking the test 4 times within a 6 week period may have introduced varying practice effects, which could explain some level of variation in individual performance outcomes over time .  Conclusion  In summary, results of our exploratory investigation suggest that the inclusion of a KS to a well-formulated hypocaloric KD can attenuate detriments in mood compared to KD + PL and low fat (LFD) interventions, with no distinct differences in cognitive function. It is possible that the KS provided adequate mineral supplementation that the KD + PL group needed and higher BHB levels than the low fat (LFD) group, resulting in overall more positive scores in the KD + KS group during weight loss.",f5d64b55-025b-48f9-9714-862090824f63
40,discussion16," Adipokines associated with both metabolic and cognitive issues responded differently in the KD + KS and low fat (LFD) groups and thus require further investigation.
