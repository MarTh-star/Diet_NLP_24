0,discussion0," The keto diet comprises high fat, low carbohydrate, and adequate protein. The aim is to have the body use fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. There are four main ketogenic diet therapies: the classic keto diet (four: one, three: one ratios), the modified Atkins diet (modified Atkins diet (MAD)), the medium-chain triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) oil diet, and the low glycemic index treatment (low glycemic index treatment (LGIT)) diet. The modified Atkins diet (MAD), medium chain triglyceride (MCT), and low glycemic index treatment (LGIT) diets are usually a lower ratio of one:one or two:one, meaning one gram of net carbohydrates plus protein to one to two grams of fat [6]. The initial therapeutic benefits of the keto diet have been shown through many studies and randomized controlled trials and have demonstrated efficacy with seizure control [7]. In recent years, the keto diet has gained worldwide recognition as a tool to promote weight loss [8].",5f8e03fa-bcee-445d-86b5-372b5dc4099e
1,discussion1," Due to the nature of the keto diet, it puts patients at risk of having hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) since the predominant form (98%) of dietary fat intake is in the form of triglycerides. Reduction in carbohydrate intake stimulates lipolysis, which then accelerates the breakdown of adipose tissue resulting in weight loss. The goal of the keto diet is to switch the preferred energy source of the body from available carbohydrates to stored triglycerides. Inadvertent intake of carbohydrates beyond the recommendation levels will switch back this preferred energy source to carbohydrates and not utilize the available triglycerides, resulting in high triglyceride levels [9].   hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is an uncommon cause of acute pancreatitis (accounting for only 5-9% of all cases of acute pancreatitis) but is associated with higher rates of morbidity and complications, including persistent organ failure, when compared to other etiologies of acute pancreatitis [4,10].",3cf5522c-0ab6-4de3-a4e9-e517c5b936fe
2,discussion2," One of the requirements for the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced pancreatitis is a triglyceride level of above 1,000mg/dL. The risk of developing acute pancreatitis increases to 5% with levels above 1,000mg/dL and 10-20% with levels beyond 2,000mg/dL [4]. The majority of patients with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced pancreatitis are younger males having comorbidities, such as T2DM and obesity, in contrast to those without hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) [5]. The causes of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced pancreatitis could be primary, such as through genetic disease, or secondary like our patient who developed hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced pancreatitis after initiating keto diet. An increase in dietary triglyceride intake as part of the keto diet leads to an increased generation of free fatty acids (free fatty acids (FFA)) following the breakdown of circulating triglycerides by pancreatic lipase [11].",e1b0a825-4cb3-4156-8dff-8b7e800e7bf2
3,discussion3," Lipotoxicity results from the increased accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA), which then stimulates an inflammatory response causing the release of intracellular calcium and pancreatic acinar necrosis. This leads to pancreatic auto-digestion and acute pancreatitis [4].  Patients with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced pancreatitis present similarly to others with acute pancreatitis from other causes and manifest symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain [8]. Physical examination may be pertinent for xanthomas on the body’s extensor surfaces and hepatosplenomegaly [4].",a6adbb75-9441-4d47-afaa-3b5ae28e83c7
4,discussion4," Diagnosing hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced pancreatitis is comparable to that of acute pancreatitis from other etiologies, which requires fulfilling two out of the three criteria, namely: acute epigastric pain radiating to the back, elevated serum lipase at least three times the upper limit of normal, and characteristic imaging findings of acute pancreatitis plus an elevated triglyceride level of at least 1,000mg/dL [4,12]. While the clinical course of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced pancreatitis is the same as that of other causes of acute pancreatitis, it is associated with higher rates of morbidity including end-organ failure, infection, and shock, as well as higher rates of mortality [13].  The initial management of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced pancreatitis is similar to that of other causes of acute pancreatitis and involves aggressive intravenous hydration, initial bowel rest followed by early enteral nutrition, and symptomatic care with pain management [13].",82236ea8-dce1-400e-a7d4-cec6c70ce50e
5,discussion5," Currently, there is no established guideline for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced pancreatitis. Nonetheless, insulin, heparin, apheresis, plasmapheresis, and medications, including fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids, have been utilized to lower the serum triglycerides level of patients with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced pancreatitis with a goal of <500mg/L. This is correlated with clinical improvement [13].  Despite evidence of the positive effects of the keto diet by reducing carbohydrate intake resulting in lower body weight and better glycemic control in patients with T2DM, long-term safety and efficacy are still lacking. A review done by Bolla et al. had shown that pediatric patients who followed the keto diet and who are prone to ketosis, such as those with type 1 diabetes, and often had negative growth effects [14]. Care must be taken to ensure healthy dietary fat intake among patients interested in starting keto diets by working closely with a dietitian.",127c6e84-7639-4d17-b5f9-9d268800c6f0
6,discussion6," If not done correctly, keto diets can have deleterious effects on the body and may include hypoglycemia, dehydration, renal calculi formation, and hyperlipidemia, particularly hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced acute pancreatitis [8]. We only found one case involving a pediatric nine-year-old girl, with no known history of diabetes mellitus, who died of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced pancreatitis attributed to the keto diet [15]. Our case, to the best of our knowledge, is the first adult patient without a prior history of hyperlipidemia who developed hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced acute pancreatitis after initiating a keto diet three months prior to presentation to promote weight loss. This case highlights the importance of recognizing the detrimental effects of keto diets and their role on serum triglycerides as a precipitating factor for hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced acute pancreatitis.",f06d1e67-63e0-4839-acbf-ae4fadcbef2d
7,discussion7," There are only a handful of reports in the literature that describe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced pancreatitis due to the keto diet, but patients and medical practitioners should be aware of the potentially dangerous relationship between the keto diet and pancreatic function even amongst patients with no history of hyperlipidemia.  Conclusions  As keto diet grows in popularity for weight loss and as an alternative diet for diseases such as T2DM, awareness of its adverse effects should also be stressed and monitored. Patients and medical providers should take caution to avoid unnecessary risk while taking advantage of the benefits this diet provides. Specifically for patients with T2DM, the increased consumption of triglycerides can lead to hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) and predispose patients to develop a severe form of pancreatitis (hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced severe pancreatitis) causing additional harm to our patients.",3151c81a-5794-4e72-99e3-bb7b681ee986
8,discussion8, Appropriate guidance by a registered nutritionist or dietician is necessary for patients who would like to take advantage of the keto-diet. Further studies on how to optimally monitor and incorporate the keto diet in this specific population are warranted.  Human Ethics  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.
