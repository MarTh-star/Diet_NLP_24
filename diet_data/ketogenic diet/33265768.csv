0,methods0," Patients presenting food addiction and/or binge eating symptoms were asked to follow a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) with protein replacement for a period of 5–7 weeks and then to follow a low-calorie diet for a further 11–21 weeks. Self-reported food addiction and binge eating symptoms and body composition were tested at baseline (T0) and the end of each diet (T1 and T2, respectively). Food addiction was assessed using the Italian version of the Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (I-YFAS 2.0) [15], while the Binge Eating Scale (Binge Eating Scale (BES)) [16] was administered to evaluate binge eating symptoms.  The I-YFAS 2.0 is a self-reported questionnaire to assess addiction-like eating behavior during the past 12 months. The scale consists of 35 items scored on an eight-point scale ranging from never (score = 0) to every day (score = 7). The YFAS 2.0 symptom count is calculated as the sum of the number of fulfilling diagnostic criteria (ranging from 0 to 11).",c76dca0e-1f79-4abf-a078-c566b9c50c57
1,methods1," Food addiction diagnosis also requires the presence of impairment\distress criteria. The severity level of food addiction is calculated as:  Mild FA (with 2–3 symptoms and impairment\distress criteria);  Moderate FA (with 4–5 symptoms and impairment\distress criteria);  Severe FA (with ≥ 6 symptoms and impairment\distress criteria).  The Binge Eating Scale is a 16-item questionnaire constructed to describe both behavioral manifestations (e.g., eating large amounts of food) and feelings/cognitions surrounding a binge episode (e.g., guilt, fear of being unable to stop eating) [16]. A Binge Eating Scale (BES) score ≥17 is an indication of binge eating symptoms, although there is no research to show that it can validly diagnose cases of binge eating disorder such as the DSM-5.  Anthropometric measurements were taken. The bodyweight of the patients, in underwear and without shoes, was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on an electronic device (SECA®).",6d15f896-0821-45fc-99e2-dcace55b3c1a
2,methods2," Height was calculated with a stadiometer (SECA®) to the nearest 0.1 cm and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2). Body circumferences were determined with a measuring tape and were used to evaluate body composition (fat mass and fat-free mass) using the equations of De Lorenzo et al. [17] to estimate fat mass in an Italian population.  The body composition results were taken into account to prescribe a suitable ketogenic diet with amino acid replacement. All the patients followed a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) with an energy intake of around 1000 kcal/die (≤ 25 g/die of carbohydrates). The daily protein intake was calculated according to fat free mass, and 60% of the total protein intake was achieved using an amino acid supplement made of isolated whey protein (Macresces, Italfarmacia, Rome).",b527ed7c-e104-4cd7-be9a-71ea29931489
3,methods3,"  The patients followed a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) for 5–7 weeks, according to the patient’s compliance, after which the same questionnaires were administered and the same instruments were applied under the same conditions to test for any changes (T1). All the patients tolerated the diet and reported no adverse effects. Diet adherence was tested through urinary ketone excretion, as measured by keto-sticks, until the end of the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD).  After the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), and without an interval period, the patients followed a low-calorie diet, after which they were tested again with the same instruments and under the same conditions (T2). Only one patient did not fill out the questionnaires at this point.  The selection of these patients by the authors was not based on the amount of weight or fat mass lost but on the specific initial presentation of binge eating and/or food addiction symptoms.",9d5ffce7-2dd0-48b9-bb67-e710a17445a4
4,methods4," The patients were taking part in a study on mental well-being and nutrition approved by the Ethics Committee for Research in the Human and Social Sciences (Committee for Research in the Human and Social Sciences (CAREUS)) of the University of Siena with protocol number 2742. Among the first 50 patients, it was suggested to those with a diagnosis of food addiction and/or binge eating symptoms and with the desire to lose weight and improve their body composition to adopt a very-low-ketogenic diet followed by a low-calorie diet. Selected patients were not taking medications or had other comorbidities. The study was conducted in full agreement with national and international regulations and the Declaration of Helsinki (2000). Limitations of the selection of participants should be noted. Only participants with the desire to lose weight among those with food addiction and/or binge eating symptoms were enrolled.",5f1bca23-051d-40a0-bcba-e9dfcb152621
5,methods5,"  Statistical Analysis  Comparisons of data for each variable (weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, fat-free mass, waist-hip ratio) were carried out by analysis of variance (ANOVA)with the factor test (three levels: T0, T1, and T2 repeated), after a normality check (Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Lilliefors test) and sphericity test (Mauchly test). Post hoc analysis was carried out by Fisher’s LSD test. A level of p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with Statistica® software (StatSoft Inc, Tulsa, United States). Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (standard error of the mean (SEM)).  3. Results  Five women completed all the procedures. The mean age was 36.4 years old (standard error of the mean (SEM) = 4.95), mean weight was 83 kg (standard error of the mean (SEM) = 1.51) and mean body mass index (BMI) was 31.16 (standard error of the mean (SEM) = 0.91) at T0.",f1bfeed7-d10a-47d0-bc7d-2fea250fa544
6,methods6,"  At baseline (T0), two of the five patients reported a severe food addiction diagnosis (Table 1—#1 and #5), one reported mild food addiction diagnosis (#3), one reported binge eating symptoms with severe food addiction diagnosis (#4) and one reported only binge eating symptoms (#2).  very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) was found to be a feasible treatment since already at T1 all the patients reported improvements in the food addiction and/or Binge Eating Scale (BES) score, as shown in Table 1. At T1, only one patient reported mild food addiction, and no binge eating symptoms were noted, according to the Binge Eating Scale (BES) questionnaire. At T2, no case of food addiction or binge eating was reported. Patient #2 outcomes are unavailable because the participant was unable to go to the scheduled appointment to take measurements and complete the questionnaires.",b308d765-9ad9-4466-845b-c54bb95cc04e
7,methods7," The participant was contacted by phone and reported that she was feeling improvements regarding binge eating symptoms and was continuing to follow the prescribed diet with no weight regain.  As shown in Table 2, at T1, the patients’ weight loss ranged from 4.8% to 11.6% of the initial body weight. ANOVA applied to bodyweight revealed a significant effect of the factor test (F(2,6) = 41.11, p < 0.001) due to T1 and T2 being significantly lower than T0 (p < 0.001 both). There was no significance between the weight measured at T1 and at T2.  The decrease in body mass index (BMI) ranged from 1.4 to 3.9. ANOVA applied to body mass index (BMI) revealed a significant effect of the factor Test (F (2,6) = 26.84, p = 0.001) due to T1 and T2 being lower than T0 (p < 0.001 both). There was no significance between the body mass index (BMI) measured at T1 and at T2.  ANOVA applied to waist-hip ratio revealed a significant effect of the factor Test (F (2,6) = 6.41, p < 0.",c174036e-4454-416f-bcc7-06ccf7e6d064
8,methods8,"05) due to T2 being lower than T0 (p = 0.01). There was no significance between the waist-hip ratio measured at T0 and T1 and at T1 and T2.  ANOVA applied to fat mass revealed a significant effect of the factor Test (F (2,6) = 31.37, p < 0.001) due to T1 and T2 being lower than T0 (p < 0.001 both). There was no statistical significance between the fat mass at T1 and T2.  ANOVA applied to fat-free mass did not show any significant difference. Thus, the weight loss was only at the expense of fat mass, as fat-free mass was preserved.  4. Discussion  4.1. Ketogenic Diet and Food Addiction  The main result of the study was the reduction in symptoms of binge eating episodes and food addiction as measured by the YFAS 2.0 and Binge Eating Scale (BES) questionnaires. All the patients showed, in addition to an improvement of food addiction and/or binge eating symptoms already at T1, weight loss and fat mass loss.",260f074c-f689-4fdb-b046-61597daf36bb
9,methods9," Moreover, at T2, no patients showed a positive diagnosis of food addiction and/or binge eating symptoms.  McClernon et al. [18] examined the effect of diet on mood, hunger, and other associated symptoms in obese patients. They found hunger reduction and lower food cravings and a reduced negative effect in ketogenic diet-fed patients compared with those on a low-fat diet.  Food addiction and binge eating symptoms are associated with the consumption of high-glycemic foods rich in sugars, which are excluded in a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD). Sethi Dalai et al. [19] supported the use of a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet as a therapeutic approach for ultra-processed food addiction and binge eating symptoms.  Ketogenic diets have been shown to prevent an increase in ghrelin secretion, otherwise seen with weight loss, as well as to reduce and/or prevent hunger.",0b742c3d-867b-4584-9c36-4fcf5da0dc71
10,methods10," Although the exact threshold of ketosis needed to induce appetite suppression and the mechanisms that mediate such an effect have yet to be elucidated [20], such diets could be a useful strategy to prevent craving for food in patients with binge eating. Moreover, the stabilization of blood glucose levels due to the ketogenic diet could reduce food craving and improve energy levels [21].  The therapeutic potential of ketogenic diets in several diseases has been reported in the literature, the most validated being obesity and refractory epilepsy. They have an emerging role in the treatment of neurological disorders, cancer, NAFLD, type 2 diabetes, and chronic pain among many others [22], but less is known about their use to treat binge eating and addiction to ultra-processed food.  Ketogenic diets have proved to be a useful strategy also in other behavioral addictions.",3c138f8a-8c8c-4d9f-a924-e4b44c0edbd1
11,methods11," Studies demonstrated that a ketogenic diet decreases alcohol intake in adult male mice [23] and diminishes behavioral responses to cocaine in young adult male and female rats [24]. Therefore, more studies assessing the effect of different ketogenic diets on addiction in humans are needed. The explanation of the potential benefit could be heterodimerization of the D1/D5 and D2/D3/D4 dopamine receptor families, which couple positively and negatively, respectively, to adenylyl cyclase. Heterodimers are formed by: D1 and adenosine A1 receptors, D2 or D3 and adenosine A2 receptors, and D2 and somatostatin SST5 receptors [25].  Although activation of the A1 receptor has been demonstrated to be one of the main anti-seizure mechanisms of the ketogenic diet [26], it seems that there is more evidence regarding the A2 receptor in the addiction field.",3afab40a-5a28-4caa-badb-8528aadabcb6
12,methods12," Hence, researchers have proposed the adenosine-dopamine binomial as an interesting target that deserves to be explored in mental and substance-use disorders [23].  4.2. Ketogenic Diet and Body Composition  All the patients tolerated the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and reported weight loss after both the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and the low-calorie diet.  Interestingly, a recent meta-analysis showed that the use of whey protein supplementation may reduce the long and short-term appetite and induce a significant reduction in prospective food consumption [27]. The main effect of supplementation with whey protein in humans with obesity is a decrease in body fat mass and an improvement of metabolic syndrome parameters. Coupled with calorie restriction and exercise, these favorable effects persist while fat-free mass is maintained [28].  Importantly we showed that a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) induced fat mass loss without a decrease of fat-free mass.",374988e3-2f7c-4e2f-bb16-7b304180a897
13,methods13," Assessment of the participants’ body composition in order to prescribe a personalized very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) protocol is fundamental to evaluate the correct daily protein intake and prevent muscle mass loss.  A very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) with protein supplementation proved to be highly effective in terms of bodyweight reduction without inducing lean body mass loss compared with a very-low restricted-calorie diet [29].  The limitations of this study should be noted. A larger sample with control conditions is required. Further studies will be needed to assess the general acceptability of this diet among patients and its long-term effects on food addiction and binge eating symptoms. One of the main limitations in prescribing a ketogenic diet is the difficulty to maintain adherence over time, and the long-term effects of a ketotic state on metabolic health, such as basic blood and liver parameters, need to be better elucidated.",888cbbc8-6bd4-4b4b-89a2-2928113f6481
14,methods14," Moreover, the order of interventions should be noted as a potential limitation on diet outcomes.  5. Conclusions  Our study strongly suggests the feasibility of a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in the treatment of a group of women with self-reported binge eating and food addiction symptoms. After a maintenance low-calorie diet, the patients experienced a reduction of food addiction and/or binge eating symptoms.  The patients showed a weight loss associated only with fat mass, while their muscle mass was preserved and their metabolic health improved.  Having a feasible nutritional approach to limit overeating and food addiction symptoms may help healthcare professionals find a reliable treatment to favor weight loss. In this view, a ketogenic diet may be a novel therapy for people with addictive-like eating disorders, helping to lower the sensation of hunger and craving.",52828076-1bdb-43ce-b650-17004b9dd90d
15,methods15,"  This pilot study described the possibility of assessing a ketogenic protocol in patients with food addiction and\or binge eating, in the absence of other pathologies, where other interventions have failed. Future research to explore the role of nutritional ketosis in addiction symptoms in humans is needed. ",fc371d11-3477-43a4-a7c1-879f20a42ef7
