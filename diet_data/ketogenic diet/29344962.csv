0,introduction0,"Epilepsy is a common chronic disease of the central nervous system. The point prevalence of active epilepsy was 6.38/1,000 individuals, while the lifetime prevalence was 7.60/1,000 individuals. The annual cumulative incidence of epilepsy was 67.77/100,000 persons, while the incidence rate was 61.44/100,000 person-years (1). Approximately, 70% of the patients with epilepsy can control their seizures through pharmacological therapy, while approximately, 30% of the patients persistently exhibit drug-resistant epilepsy. Epilepsy is considered as drug-resistant seizures that persist despite the administration of two antiepileptic drugs adapted to the patient's needs, with an effective and well-tolerated dosage, either as a single agent or in combination (2). The management of drug-resistant epilepsy is a major public health concern, and the development of antiepileptic drugs is based on new targets with clinical significance.",89cc3d34-5e3e-48dc-b7a4-82962b431741
1,introduction1,"  A ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that is effective in treating drug-resistant epilepsy (3, 4). However, the underlying mechanism is yet unclear. Long-term ketogenic diets are not well-tolerated and often cause several adverse reactions, including growth retardation in children and an increased risk of atherosclerosis in adults (4, 5). Therefore, clarifying the mechanism of action of ketogenic diets and applying new drug research and development is crucial. The ketogenic diet involves the catabolism of ketone bodies into acetoacetic acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone in the presence of excessive fat, and several studies suggested that an acute ketone body injection into animals inhibit seizures (6–8), however, the specific mechanism is unclear. In this study, we speculated that a correlation is established between ketone bodies and acid sensitivity and explored the effect of ketone bodies on acid-sensing ion channels.",52c20fb8-55b7-40c3-b450-a5bee86ed81c
2,introduction2, Primary culture of rat hippocampal neurons with the patch clamp technique was used to study the three types of ketone body on acid-sensing ions of the hippocampal neurons. The present study examined a new method for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy based on the “ketone body-acid sensing ion channel” of antiepileptic drug targets in order to provide a theoretical basis.  ,5541acb4-31b6-44ad-8dd7-0a0ebf533f0c

13,results2,"  Acetoacetic Acid, β-Hydroxybutyric Acid, and Acetone Significantly Inhibits the Opening of Acid-Sensing Ion Channels in Rat Hippocampal Neurons at pH 6.0 According to the previous report, ASIC1a has a pH0.5 of 6.2, which mediates fast decaying, transient currents. Thus, in the current study, we selected pH 6.0 to treat the hippocampus neuron such as to induce the activity of ASIC1a. Subsequently, acetoacetic acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone were identified as potential regulatory compositions after ketogenic diets. To test the hypothesis whether these compositions can regulate the neural electrophysiology in the exciting neurons, we examined the current wave amplitude of the acid-sensing ion channel at pH < 6.0. Consequently, acetoacetic acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone significantly decreases the current wave amplitude after treatment pH < 6.0 (Figures 2A, 3A, 4A), and the inhibitory rates were 92 ± 5% (P < 0.01, Figure 2B), 47 ± 7% (P < 0.",3300974e-6792-4e3e-a997-712dc58716da

16,discussion0,"The main results of the present study are as follows: ASIC1 is primarily expressed in the excitatory neuron, the expression of ASIC1 in the interneuron, at least in the PV-positive neuron, is limited. The products of the ketogenic diet metabolism such as acetoacetic acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone inhibited the acid-sensitive ion channel and its function.  The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet and is effective in treating drug-resistant epilepsy (10). However, the underlying mechanism is yet to be elucidated. Patients on the long-term ketogenic diet do not easily tolerate this diet, and the ketogenic diet often causes several adverse reactions, such as growth retardation in children and increased risk of atherosclerosis in adults (4, 5). Therefore, understanding the mechanism of action of ketogenic diets and applying for new drug research and development is critical.",0d001923-35ea-4af3-8ee0-43e33a7c5387
17,discussion1,"  In the ketogenic diet, excess fatty acids produce acetyl-CoA in the liver, which is then broken down into ketones, including acetic acid (acetic acid (ACA)), β-hydroxybutyric acid (βHB), and acetone. Previous studies suggested that an acute injection into animals can inhibit the ketone body seizures (6, 7), but the specific mechanism is unclear. Moreover, ketone bodies might also function by acting on ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP), N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (N methyl D aspartic acid (NMDA)) or γ-aminobutyric acid channels (11, 12).  In this study, we speculated a correlation between ketone bodies and acid sensitivity. Also, the effects of acetoacetic acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone on the open state of acid-sensing ion channels of hippocampal neurons were investigated using the patch-clamp technique.",f3184139-83e1-4ce2-98c7-63b6883b3499
18,discussion2," We found that all the three ketone bodies significantly inhibited the opening of acid-sensing ion channels, and the rates of inhibition were 92, 47, and 77%, respectively. Thus, the ketogenic diet may be able to treat drug-resistant epilepsy through the inhibition of ketone bodies of acid-sensing ion channels.  The acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs, acid-sensing ion channels) also known as H+ gating ion channels, are a type of proton-activated cation channels, which belong to the family of element/epithelial sodium channels (degenerin/epithelial Na+ channels, DEG/ENaC). H+ is an ASIC channel agonist; therefore, ASICs can be regarded as ligands that regulate this family of channels. The ASIC family members include four genes (Asic1, Asic2, Asic3, Asic4). Hitherto, the six subunits of ASICs, ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, Asic3, Asic4, have been cloned from ASICs.",ad363170-17f7-4bcd-baec-a55fef6ec190
19,discussion3," Tissue acidification is necessary to activate the ASICs, and the activation of ASICs depends on the rapid and significant decrease in pH (< 1 s) (13–15).  Presently, ASICs is extensively studied as major therapeutic target of acid toxicity injury (16, 17). Xiong et al. (18) demonstrated that ischemic brain injury in brain cells enhanced the anaerobic metabolism and led to a marked decline in pH. This process led to significant acidosis and ASIC1a activation, a large inflow of calcium ions, and calcium overload after extensive cell death. The addition of ASIC1a-specific blockers PcTX or the non-specific ASICs blocker amiloride in vivo and in vitro causing acidosis secondary to neuronal damage was significantly reduced, and the scope of cerebral infarction was also declined significantly. Thus, ASIC1a-mediated acidosis during cerebral ischemia resulted from neuronal death.",ed73368d-732e-4718-8c10-9b66804bbcd3
20,discussion4," Since the epileptic seizures, especially status epilepticus (SE), cause severe and harmful stimulation of the brain, we speculated that severe seizures might also lead to acid-sensing ion channels in the brain to mediate acid toxicity. Interestingly, because ketobodies can inhibit the opening of acid-sensing ion channels, we speculated that the ketobodies might exert a neuroprotective role by inhibiting acid-sensing ion channel-mediated brain tissue acid toxicity.  Currently, the correlation between acid-sensing ion channels and epilepsy primarily focuses on seizures after the changes in the expression of acid-sensing ion channel subunits and the antagonists on the direct effect of epileptic seizures. Wu et al. (19) found that intraperitoneal injection of the ASIC antagonist amiloride reduces the proportion of rats reaching Racine level IV seizures, protected the piriform cortex layer II and III neurons, and prolonged the survival in the acute phase following status epilepticus (SE).",cac306ea-c6bf-415a-80d2-2141c0b43fba
21,discussion5," Using EEG studies, Liang et al. (20) observed that the intraperitoneal injection of the ASICs antagonist amiloride in rats greatly reduced the frequency of abnormal discharge within 90 min after injection. The current study found that the ASIC1a and ASIC3 expression was increased after SE. Using the patch clamp technique on hippocampal slices, Ievglevskyi et al. (21) observed that the non-selective ASIC inhibitors 5b resulted in spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic potential discharge frequency, and the inhibition of ASICs was abated without the magnesium model and KA model-induced epilepsy discharge. In summary, non-selective ASIC receptor antagonists can suppress the seizures. Herein, we found that the ketobodies can inhibit the acid-sensing ion channels, and thus, it can be speculated that ketobodies can reduce the excitability of neurons by inhibiting the acid-sensing ion channels, thereby exerting an anti-epileptic role.",b60d35a3-90ee-48ae-860b-3a4d8e99e3c8
22,discussion6," However, due to the limitation of the equipment and technology, we could not test the currents under the physiological pH condition. According to the previous report (22), ASIC1a mediates fast decaying, transient currents with a pH0.5 of ~6.2. We followed the protocol and treated hippocampus neuron with pH 6.0 to induce the activity of ASIC1a. However, to get more solid and convincing data to support the hypothesis of this project, we acknowledge that we should test the real-time pH changes in the microenvironment and measure the neuronal currents during the epilepsy process.  Taken together, acid-sensing ion channel antagonists can inhibit seizures, acid-sensitive channels mediate the body's acid toxic effect, and ketone bodies can inhibit the acid-sensing ion channels. Thus, we speculated that ketone bodies play an antiepileptic role via two pathways. One, the ketone bodies can inhibit the acid-sensing ion channels that directly alter the nerve excitability.",a1f1c232-b6f7-4699-a7ef-a5cc41e44b46
23,discussion7," On the other hand, ketone bodies can inhibit an acid-sensing ion channel-mediated acid toxic effect and result in a neuroprotective effect during the epileptic seizures. Thus, the “keto-acid-sensing ion channel” seems to be a promising target for the drug-resistant epilepsy drug treatment, and hence, the underlying antiepileptic mechanism needs to be investigated further.
