0,introduction0,"Voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels (Kv channels) regulate the resting membrane potential and set the threshold and duration of the action potential in excitable cells. Among these, Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 voltage-gated K+ subunits, encoded by the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes, are expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system (Brown and Adams, 1980; Wang et al., 1998). These subunits form homo- and heterotetrameric channels underlying the M-current (IKM), a non-inactivating K+ current with slow activation and deactivation kinetics that activates at the threshold potential of about −60/−50 mV, thus regulating the resting membrane potential and suppressing repetitive neuronal firing (Brown and Adams, 1980).

1,introduction1," Indeed, some variants have been identified in patients with benign familial neonatal epilepsy (benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE)), an autosomal-dominant epilepsy with seizures affecting otherwise healthy infants in the first days of life and spontaneously disappearing over the next several months, with mostly normal neurocognitive development (Jentsch, 2000; Singh et al., 2003; Soldovieri et al., 2006). At the severe end of the KCNQ2 spectrum is an early-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE)) characterized by recurrent seizures starting in the neonatal period and neurodevelopmental disability . While more than 300 pathogenic variants have been described in KCNQ2, few variants in KCNQ3 have been detected, mostly in families with benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE).",1d69c2ba-7611-454c-adbc-eaec17dbfd71
2,introduction2," In addition, de novo variants in KCNQ3 have been rarely described in children with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (Allen et al., 2013; Grozeva et al., 2015; Miceli et al., 2015; Ambrosino et al., 2018; Lauritano et al., 2019), intellectual disability (ID) apparently without epilepsy (Rauch et al., 2012; Deciphering Developmental Disorders, 2017), cortical visual impairment , and in patients with ID and autism .  In most children affected with KCNQ2- or KCNQ3-related benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE), seizures are controlled with conventional antiepileptic drugs, including sodium channel blockers . Instead, few options are available for patients with the most severe forms of KCNQ2- or KCNQ3-related disorders; in addition to sodium-channel blockers such as carbamazepine and phenytoin which appear to be highly effective (Pisano et al.",e457ed48-26ff-43c7-a709-3ebdfaa97481
3,introduction3,", 2015), ezogabine, a selective Kv7 channel activator, has been shown to improve seizure control and development in patients with Kv7.2 loss-of-function (LoF) variants . Unfortunately, because of its unfavorable risk/benefit ratio, ezogabine has been withdrawn from the market. Among non-pharmacological therapies, ketogenic diet (KD) has been recently shown to be particularly effective in children with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) caused by KCNQ2 variants , but the mechanisms of action are not completely understood and there are no data on the effects on KCNQ3 related disorders. KD is a low carbohydrate, high-fat, adequate-protein diet regimen that shifts the primary fuel source for neuronal activity from glucose to endogenous ketones: acetone, acetoacetate, and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB).",50654703-7111-4416-a3ee-c572b90f05f5
4,introduction4," KD likely improves seizure control through a variety of mechanisms such as inhibition of the glycolysis, disruption of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (Lutas and Yellen, 2013). Recently, BHB has been shown to directly and specifically activate Kv7 channels containing Kv7.3 subunits by increasing current sensitivity to voltage (Manville et al., 2018, 2020).  In the present manuscript, we report the clinical, molecular and functional properties of a benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) family carrying a novel KCNQ3 variant (c.719T>G; p.M240R) segregating with epilepsy in the three affected individuals. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings in Chinese hamster ovary (Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)) cells revealed that homomeric Kv7.3 M240R channels were not functional, whereas heteromeric channels incorporating Kv7.3 M240R mutant subunits with Kv7.2 and Kv7.",3bb8d2d0-414a-41ea-a126-f7882cc54517

Consistent with these functional data, molecular modeling suggested that the M240R substitution preferentially stabilized the resting state and possibly destabilize the activated state of the Kv7.3 subunits. Finally, we demonstrate that BHB was able to reverse the functional alterations observed in heteromeric channels carrying Kv7.3 M240R subunits.  ",52d5816f-9816-46a3-9c53-098a5d43406b

To achieve a better understanding of the possible role of the M240 residue in the gating process and of the structural consequences of its replacement with an R, we built homology models of a Kv7.3 subunit in both resting and activated states, as previously described . Our structural models suggested that, no electrostatic interaction between the M240 residue side chain and surrounding protein residues occurs in both the resting and the activated VSD configurations (Figure 3A); in particular, in the resting VSD state and in two of the four subunits, the M240 side chain points toward the N-terminal region of the same subunits, whereas in the other two subunits it points in the opposite direction, namely toward the S5 segment (Figure 3B).",fa03f873-0a84-49f1-a72a-11052dd1e24c

Instead, VSD movement during the activation process translated the R240 side chain in a tight pocket surrounded by non-polar residues, possibly destabilizing the tight network of hydrophobic interactions within this pocket. As a result, our model suggests that the M240R substitution may preferentially stabilize the closed state and possibly destabilize the activated state of the Kv7.3 subunits.

26,discussion1," KCNQ2 variants responsible for benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) are missense, stop-gain, frameshift, splice variants, and deletions randomly distributed along the entire primary sequence of the subunit. In contrast, benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE)-causing KCNQ3 variants are all missense, affecting specific residues located in the pore region of the channel (S5–S6 and intervening loop; Table 2). Prior studies have reported 13 such variants, each affecting a different Kv7.3 residue located in and around the pore (Table 2); in addition, four Kv7.3 variants affecting residues in the long C-terminus have also been described, although the pathogenic role of these variants appears questionable due to their ample representation in the gnomAD population database without the benefit of supportive functional data (N821S, Bassi et al., 2005; R780C, Zara et al., 2013), or with functional data that fail to support a disease association (N468S, Singh et al.",4e3b455a-3d47-41da-a691-5b658e39d18a

Out of the 13 KCNQ3 variants causing benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE), those nine with supportive functional data lie within a span of 51 residues (V279 to R330) in this region. Functional analyses of these variants to date, e.g., V279F, I317T, R330C, and R330L, have mostly demonstrated a reduction in maximal current with no effect on the voltage-dependence of activation (Soldovieri et al., 2014; Miceli et al., 2015; Maljevic et al., 2016), consistent with these variants being in the pore.

These functional results suggest that the introduction of an additional positively charged residue at the bottom of S4 in Kv7.3 subunits destabilizes the activated conformation of the voltage sensor, thereby impeding pore opening. Structural modeling provides a potential explanation for such a conclusion; indeed, introduction of an R at position 240 stabilizes the VSD resting state by forming a novel strong ionic interaction with an highly conserved residue in the N-terminus; in addition, the larger R side chain may destabilize the tight network of hydrophobic interaction occurring in the activated state. Further studies using residue swapping or charge reversion are needed to confirm the potential interaction between the R240 and E116 residues.",a4cfb943-0e8d-4d46-8286-2b73cdbd3346
30,discussion5," The available data do not allow us to determine whether the G/V shift introduced by the mutation originates from the participation of the 240 residue in voltage-sensing or in the subsequent steps along the activation pathway leading to pore opening. However, the fact that recent structural data from human Kv7.1 (Sun and MacKinnon, 2020), reveal that the V241 residue, corresponding to the M240 residue in Kv7.3, is located within a key region for VSD-pore electro-mechanical coupling , raises the possibility that this residue may play a similar functional role also in Kv7.3. Therefore, a LoF mechanism appears mainly responsible for benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) pathogenesis in our family. Similar conclusions have been reached for benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE)-causing variants in Kv7.2, where haploinsufficiency, corresponding to an IKM reduction of only ∼25%, appears responsible for disease pathogenesis (Jentsch, 2000).",682a940a-bada-4729-89ef-34fba2b83a57

In fact, individuals with mild/moderate ID have been described in benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) pedigrees (I317T, R330L; Soldovieri et al., 2014; Miceli et al., 2015); moreover, de novo variants in KCNQ3 have been described in children with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (Allen et al., 2013; Grozeva et al., 2015; Miceli et al., 2015; Ambrosino et al., 2018; Lauritano et al., 2019), ID apparently without epilepsy (Rauch et al., 2012; Deciphering Developmental Disorders, 2017), cortical visual impairment , and in patients with ID and autism .",4872ba35-d255-4d03-9c46-e6c2e592def2
32,discussion7," Such phenotypic heterogeneity is at least in part correlated with variant-specific functional effects, by yet unknown mechanisms; in fact, opposite to benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) variants causing LoF, gain-of-function (GoF) variants cause non-verbal ID, autism, and prominent sleep-activated multifocal epileptiform every 2 h Electroencephalography (EEG) discharges without neonatal seizures .  The observation that epilepsy-associated variants in KCNQ2 are more than 10 times more frequent than those in KCNQ3, suggests that KCNQ3 tolerates variation better than KCNQ2. Several pieces of evidence support this view; as an example, while heterozygous frameshift variants in KCNQ2 are frequent causes of benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) , no heterozygous pathogenic frameshift KCNQ3 variant has ever been associated with a human phenotype.",29356a92-d05d-492c-b24c-3450a545ca9f
33,discussion8," In addition, no individual carrying KCNQ2 frameshift variants in homozygosity has ever been described, as minimal KCNQ2 residual activity is probably essential for survival ; by contrast, two recent studies reported the occurrence of homozygous frameshift variants in KCNQ3 (each inherited from an asymptomatic parent) in patients with developmental delay and neonatal seizures , demonstrating that, homozygous variants in KCNQ3 are compatible with life. Moreover, a distinct functional role of these two genes emerging from developmental and genetic studies in humans, appears also to be recapitulated in mice. In fact, while KCNQ2 homozygous KO mice died at birth, homozygous KCNQ3 KO mice showed no seizures and survived until adulthood (Tzingounis and Nicoll, 2008; Kim et al.",d08d0fc5-c2b7-4017-b6a0-3141299488c7
34,discussion9,", 2016); similarly, conditional deletion of KCNQ2 in cortical pyramidal neurons increased neuronal excitability and decreased lifespan, whereas deletion of KCNQ3 neither increased pyramidal neurons excitability nor affected mice survival .  Notably, in heteromeric channels, the functional effects of the M240R variant in Kv7.3 herein described in a benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) family are quantitatively and qualitatively very similar to those triggered by the R213Q variant in Kv7.2, the latter identified in sporadic patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) . The fact that similar, dramatic in vitro functional consequences are associated to a severe phenotype in Kv7.2 and to self-limiting epilepsy in Kv7.3, further supports the hypothesis that Kv7.3 is more tolerant than Kv7.2 to genetic changes causing LoF effects.",23ccd9f3-0fb3-4f22-8f63-f2dec40dcff9
35,discussion10," Among many others, such as inclusion/exclusion of both genes in panels for developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), diagnostic NGS coverage, and epistatic compensation, an attractive explanation for such distinct functional role lies in the different developmental pattern of expression, with KCNQ2 being expressed at earlier stages of development when compared to KCNQ3, in both mice and humans .  In patients with KCNQ2- and KCNQ3-related disorders, seizures are controlled with sodium channel blockers in most patients . However, a percentage continues to have seizures, which may contribute to cognitive impairment. In addition, successful management of seizures does not address the neurodevelopmental disability that occurs in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE)s.",ae972a63-144b-417f-b76d-46e8cd0c7d02
36,discussion11," Efficacy of the KD, with greater than 90% seizure reduction, has been reported in patients with monogenic developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE)s, including KCNQ2-developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE)  and Dravet syndrome (Knupp and Wirrell, 2018). Our finding that the endogenous ketone BHB can activate heteromeric Kv7.2 + Kv7.3 channels containing Kv7.3 M240R subunits to the same extent as wild-type Kv7.2 + Kv7.3 channels (Manville et al., 2018, 2020), thereby counteracting the underlying pathophysiology, suggests that the KD could represent precision medicine for more severe phenotypes caused by KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 LoF variants. Further work is required to identify additional patients carrying KCNQ3 or KCNQ2 pathogenic LoF variants retaining responsiveness to BHB in vitro and who may benefit from KD treatment in vivo.",4b808e77-60a3-4626-a5a1-00364b26c1df
37,discussion12,"  Conclusion In conclusion, we describe the first missense LoF pathogenic variant located in the S4 segment of KCNQ3 as a cause of benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE). In contrast to benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE)-KCNQ3 variants previously described, functional and modeling data suggest that the M240R variant primarily affects the voltage sensitivity of heteromeric channels. Our study provides a pharmacological rationale for investigating the use of KD in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) caused by KCNQ3 and KCNQ2 LoF variants.
