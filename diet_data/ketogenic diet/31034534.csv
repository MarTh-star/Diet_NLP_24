Data Sources A systematic literature search of Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (published until 11 February 2020) of patients with overweight or obesity and with or without T2DM that evaluated the effects of a ketogenic diet on glycemic control, weight loss, and lipid profile as primary endpoints. The initial database search strategies were pre-specified as follows: the search term was composed of a combination of key words and Medical Subject Headings (ketogenic diet or high-fat diet) in title/abstract AND (glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in title/abstract; search filters were set as “clinical trials” and “humans.",77498ff7-f7e9-4085-b866-15481241a4ec

Ethics committee review and informed consent from study participants were waived as this meta-analysis was conducted by pooling existing patient data extracted from published primary research.   2.2. Study Selection and Data Collection Two reviewers (Shin and Choi) independently searched the databases for relevant RCTs. Those studies identified through the initial search were screened for eligibility using the following inclusion criteria: (1) RCTs of the metabolic effects of ketogenic diets in patients with overweight or obesity, (2) glycemic outcomes must be associated with a ketogenic diet but regardless of patients’ T2DM status at baseline, (3) sufficient raw data obtainable from primary research, and (4) studies published in English.

Included studies had randomized patients to either a ketogenic diet or a control diet and reported pre-post glycemic indices, such as FG and HbA1c, along with other metabolic parameters related to weight and lipid controls. In case of multiple intervention periods followed up in a single study, the intervention duration in the present meta-analysis was defined as the last available study period in each study.

3,methods3," Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment of Evidence The quality assessment of the included RCTs was carried out per the Cochrane Risk of Bias approach on the basis of the following accounts: randomization adequacy, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, investigators and outcome assessors, follow-up duration and drop-out rates, and application of intention-to-treat analysis. Studies were then scored as low, unclear, or high risk of bias in the following domains: selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting, and other bias. Additionally, we rated the quality of each evidence as high, moderate, low, and very low in effect estimates for individual outcomes, based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE)) approach, in which studies are evaluated on five aspects: precision, consistency of effect, directness, risk of bias, and publication bias [19,20].",dddbdb2f-d80c-4685-9e69-92b31961bbf4
4,methods4," Disagreement on risk of bias and quality of evidence was resolved through discussion among authors.  2.4. Data Analysis and Statistical Methods The efficacy of a ketogenic diet was evaluated by pooling data from individual RCTs, and the overall effect size of continuous variables were presented as the weighted standardized mean difference (standardized mean difference (SMD)) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Post-treatment laboratory values in the ketogenic diet-receiving patients were compared against those in comparator group patients. The primary serum levels assessed in this meta-analysis included FG, HbA1c, fasting insulin, C-peptide, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL), along with other laboratory findings, such as C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) and serum creatinine (SCr).",5159410f-419f-45c6-95bd-d70320f3c3cc

Heterogeneity across the studies was quantitatively evaluated by Q-statistic and I2 index. When I2 < 50%, which was considered as a low heterogeneity, a Mantel–Haenszel fixed-effects model was implemented; otherwise (I2 > 50%), a random-effects model was adopted. When the mean and standard deviation were not specifically given, we calculated those summary statistics by utilizing other effect estimates and measures of dispersion. In consideration of T2DM status at baseline and to minimize potential sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were designed when appropriate in accordance with the presence of T2DM as comorbidity among included patients.",3634a6eb-7ce5-4df5-be0d-bb2fe8f7c2af

Two of the studies had a high risk of attrition bias [24,28], and one had a high risk of bias due to imbalance in baseline triglyceride levels between groups [27]. Otherwise, the risk of bias assessment of the included studies was generally acceptable, and the funnel plots did not signify any evidence of publication bias.  3.3. The Effects of a Ketogenic Diet on Glycemic Control  We stratified participants in accordance with the T2DM status at baseline. Subgroup analysis of patients with overweight or obesity and with preexisting T2DM revealed a substantial difference in the change of HbA1c (standardized mean difference (SMD), −0.62; 95% CI, −0.89 to −0.35; I2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence) and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) (standardized mean difference (SMD), −0.29; 95% CI, −0.54 to −0.04; I2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence) (Figure 3).",95838c53-974f-40a8-aab1-d1143a06caad

In overall patients, the ketogenic diet appeared more effective in lowering FG (standardized mean difference (SMD), −0.25; 95% CI, −0.50 to −0.00; I2 = 52%; low quality evidence) and HbA1c (standardized mean difference (SMD), −0.48; 95% CI, −0.69 to −0.27; I2 = 23%; moderate quality evidence) than comparator diets (Figure 3). The mean between-group difference in HbA1c changes was −0.5% (p < 0.001) and −0.42% (p < 0.001) in diabetic patients and overall patients, respectively.   In consideration of potential confounding effects owing to heterogeneity across RCTs, we performed an additional analysis after excluding two RCTs [23,25] from meta-analysis for relatively short-term follow-up [23,25] and antihyperglycemic use on the day of serum sampling for glucose and insulin measurement [25].",f033944d-c0e0-4904-8727-a156ee69329f

The Effects of a Ketogenic Diet on Weight Control Eight studies reported changes in weight-related parameters post the dietary intervention [21,24,26,27,28,29,32,34]. Meta-analysis demonstrated that ketogenic diet patients were more likely to experience a greater weight reduction compared to those on comparator diets (standardized mean difference (SMD), −0.46; 95% CI, −0.90 to −0.03; I2 = 78%; moderate to low quality evidence) (Figure 4).

The Effects of a Ketogenic Diet on Lipid Panel Study patients were stratified in accordance with the T2DM status at baseline. Subgroup analysis of patients with overweight or obesity and with T2DM revealed that the ketogenic diet showed a greater efficacy in controlling serum levels of triglyceride (standardized mean difference (SMD), −0.45; 95% CI, −0.80 to −0.10; I2 = 59%; moderate quality evidence) while raising high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (standardized mean difference (SMD), 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.52; I2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence) than comparator diets (Figure 5).

When all patients were included in the analysis regardless of T2DM status, the ketogenic diet was associated with a greater reduction in triglyceride levels (p = 0.02; moderate to low quality evidence) and an increase in serum levels of both low density lipoprotein (LDL) (p = 0.04; moderate to low quality evidence) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) (p = 0.01).   The mean between-group difference in triglyceride changes was −35.12 mg/dL (p = 0.002) in diabetic patients and −20.65 mg/dL (p = 0.02) in overall patients. The mean difference in high density lipoprotein (HDL) changes was +3.48 mg/dL (p = 0.003) in diabetic patients and +1.91 mg/dL (p = 0.02) in overall patients.",37928b5e-eacb-4f7f-a94f-ea792436abdd

In order to remove a potential confounding factor, we repeated meta-analysis after excluding the RCT of nondiabetic patients by Yancy et al. (2010) [34], where the control arm patients received orlistat, a weight loss therapy that functions by preventing dietary fat from being absorbed into the body, as an add-on to a low-fat diet, which might have affected post-intervention lipid results.

Additionally, similar results were confirmed in a separate analysis where a potential confounding effect due to heterogeneity in terms of the length of follow-up was eliminated by excluding one more RCT of diabetic patients [23] from meta-analysis of triglyceride control: The effect of a ketogenic diet on triglyceride changes in both T2DM patients and overall patients remained statistically significant (p = 0.005 and p = 0.02, respectively).

Additional meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the safety of the ketogenic diet in terms of these parameters relative to comparator diets in patients with overweight or obesity. Our analysis results revealed that there was no substantial between-group difference in post-intervention changes in all of the aforementioned parameters (Figure 6).  4.

17,methods17," The main findings included: (1) a ketogenic diet for 3 to 12 months was more effective for glycemic control as indicated by a significant reduction in HbA1c and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) values for diabetic patients. Notably, the mean post-intervention improvement in HbA1c levels was −0.5% (p < 0.001) and −0.42% (p < 0.001) in diabetic patients and overall patients, respectively, indicating clinically relevant improvement in glycemic control in these patient populations. (2) A ketogenic diet for 4 weeks to 12 months was linked to a greater weight loss in patients with overweight or obesity regardless of T2DM. The mean post-intervention weight change was −7.78 kg (p < 0.001) and −3.81 kg (p = 0.01) in diabetic patients and overall patients, respectively.",3fbc5836-2485-4cfd-98b5-62de3d55ee0e
18,methods18," (3) A ketogenic diet for 4 days and up to 2 years led to improved lipid profiles for diabetic patients, such as lower triglyceride and higher high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, whereas for nondiabetic patients an increase in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. The mean post-intervention improvement in triglyceride levels was −35.12 mg/dL (p = 0.002) and −20.65 mg/dL (p = 0.02) in overall patients. (4) The effect of a ketogenic diet on cardiovascular and renal risk markers was comparable to that of a low-fat diet. The findings of this meta-analysis demonstrated that a ketogenic diet can be a more beneficial dietary option for diabetic patients with overweight or obesity and to improve metabolic factors related to glycemic, weight, and lipid controls.",2f10e2af-060a-4936-8f61-0864a3b59fd3
19,methods19,"   The incidences of chronic disorders including T2DM, cardiovascular disorders, renal disorders and malignancies rise with increasing life expectancy, and the majority of these disorders are closely associated with excessive nutrients or obesity [2]. Thus, the importance of a proper diet cannot be neglected in chronic disease prevention and management, and various dietary plans including a conventional diet for weight loss are currently available for weight loss or prevention of obesity-associated disorders [35]. Recent studies [36,37] suggested that caloric restriction without malnutrition, the cornerstone of weight loss, may help to extend lifespan by preventing age-associated pathogenesis. Besides, inducing starvation via dietary regimens of alternate-day fasting [38] or intermittent fasting [39] has shown to reduce caloric intake and improve health markers related to cardiovascular risk in populations irrespective of obesity status.",4475fef1-d131-45d2-8d37-d25e18e8864e
20,methods20,"   A ketogenic diet, another method to induce metabolic starvation in the body, strictly limits the intake of carbohydrates, the major sources for glucose, and increases fat consumption instead [40]. This high-fat diet is currently recommended as a treatment for patients with medication-refractory epilepsy [8,9]. The exact mechanism of its anticonvulsive activity is still under debate; however, dietary fatty acids, including omega-6 and omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, have shown to regulate signal-transduction pathways in the brain [41]. Moreover, the neuroprotective effects of the ketogenic diet have also been reported in studies, which would benefit patients with Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease [42,43]. Recently, some studies advocated the beneficial effects of the ketogenic diet in weight management and prevention of metabolic syndrome by inducing nutritional ketosis [15].",93b833c4-febf-47f7-8b3e-1520aef549c2
21,methods21," Carbohydrate restriction to less than 50 g per day triggers gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis in the liver, production of ketone bodies such as acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid from fatty acids in replacement of glucose [44]. Ketogenesis usually takes place once endogenous glucose production is depleted and lowers insulin levels in the blood, which further limits the storage of fat and glucose in the body [44].   In accordance with the biochemical hypothesis, our meta-analysis evaluating the effects of a ketogenic diet over low-fat dietary plans demonstrated significantly greater weight loss in patients with overweight or obesity. body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference, on the other hand, were shown to have a decreasing tendency with a ketogenic diet, albeit not statistically significant. According to Johnston et al.",f68c97a9-d1aa-4271-a732-9cec4e821c6b
22,methods22," [45], 4 weeks of a ketogenic diet was sufficient for patients with obesity to decrease food intake by regulating appetite and hunger and subsequently lose 6.34 kg on average. Interestingly, a previous meta-analysis [46] displayed much more substantial weight loss with a long-term very-low carbohydrate ketogenic diet when compared with a low-fat diet, a conventional diet for weight loss, but the appropriateness of a long-term ketogenic diet for weight loss should be thoroughly evaluated before being endorsed as a viable treatment option for obesity.   In this study, the benefits of a ketogenic diet were considerably greater in diabetic patients with obesity and, reflected by markedly lower HbA1C levels. The primary reasons for improved glycemic profiles are involved with lowered postprandial glucose and enhanced insulin sensitivity.",f57ffafa-d254-4558-bac0-a222a4cc141f
23,methods23," Although our study did not evaluate the changes of postprandial glucose levels with a ketogenic diet, we could assume that carbohydrate restriction from a ketogenic diet decreased postprandial glucose in diabetic patients since postprandial glucose regulation is closely related to the amount of carbohydrates consumed [47]. On the contrary, enhanced insulin sensitivity with a ketogenic diet in diabetic patients with obesity was confirmed in our analysis, as supported by significantly reduced homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) values irrespective of insignificant changes in fasting insulin and C-peptide levels, both of which are markers for insulin secretion.",05b65a13-5539-4d2b-879e-c361597e0849
24,methods24," Obesity induces insulin resistance, mediated by chronic low-grade inflammation including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and hyperinsulinemia secondary to diminished insulin excretion via the kidney and the liver along with increased insulin production resulting from the increased number of pancreatic beta-cells, and weight loss is reported to attenuate or reverse obesity-induced insulin resistance [48,49]. Although our study results did not provide evidence on direct association between insulin sensitivity and weight loss, enhanced insulin sensitivity from a ketogenic diet can be expected in the context of biological responses to weight loss, and such a relationship has been demonstrated in a previous meta-analysis that reported substantial weight loss-dependent glycemic improvement with a low-carbohydrate diet [50].",0f982c93-0c16-4a44-8355-a0551e3ffb78
25,methods25,"   In 2019, American Diabetes Association (American Diabetes Association (ADA)) newly endorsed low-carbohydrate diet as part of medical nutrition therapy options in diabetic patients based on the study results denoting enhanced glycemic control with a very low-carbohydrate diet inducing nutritional ketosis in T2DM patients [27,50,51,52]. Besides, nutritional ketosis has shown the capacity to reduce the use of hypoglycemic agents in diabetic patients [32,52]. However, American Diabetes Association (ADA) highly stresses the importance of individualized dietary plans based on personal eating patterns, preferences and metabolic goals because a low-carbohydrate high-fat diet may have some issues with long-term sustainability [51]. According to a meta-analysis performed by Sainsbury et al. [50], the enhanced effect of carbohydrate-restriction on glycemic control is most significant during the first 3 to 6 months and becomes less effective thereafter.",2f028451-e8ec-4f18-aa4f-37a0a2e2e770
26,methods26," Our meta-analysis for glycemic control incorporated 4 studies [27,28,30,34] that had intervention duration of at least 8 months or longer, and hence, further study on long-term sustainability along with long-term benefits of a ketogenic diet in glycemic control is warranted.   Obesity has a clear correlation with the incidence of cardiovascular disorders including hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure and sudden death, and many patients with insulin resistance, the main etiology of T2DM, tend to have high triglyceride and low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels [53,54,55].",e0e8baa3-93b6-4ef8-bae9-79b37252935d
27,methods27," Therefore, we analyzed the impact of a ketogenic diet on lipid controls and cardiovascular risk markers and found similar results to previous studies [46,56,57] that evaluated the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet; our analysis revealed that a ketogenic diet decreased triglycerides while increasing total cholesterol secondary to increased low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in patients with overweight or obesity, but no significant changes in other cardiovascular risk markers including blood pressure, C reactive protein (CRP), and SCr were detected. Considering low high density lipoprotein (HDL) and high triglyceride levels being independent risk factors for insulin resistance and cardiovascular disorders [58], our analysis suggested that a ketogenic diet has cardioprotective effects in diabetic patients as the effects of a ketogenic diet on triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) were much more significant in diabetic patients.",4f0e9064-116d-4e35-bdf8-ad14aa4abd6f
28,methods28," However, cardioprotective effects of a ketogenic diet in patients with obesity but no T2DM are yet to be determined due to relatively higher post-intervention levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol. Interestingly, the study conducted by Westman et al. [59] showed that a ketogenic diet changed the composition of low density lipoprotein (LDL) subclasses, increasing the proportion of large-sized buoyant low density lipoprotein (LDL) with cardiovascular protective effects while significantly decreasing small-sized dense low density lipoprotein (LDL), which is the primary cause of atherogenesis in the arterial intima. Thus, it would be important to determine whether increased low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels observed in patients with obesity but no T2DM in our study are due to the increase of large-sized buoyant low density lipoprotein (LDL), which can potentially contribute to the cardioprotective effects by ketogenic diets.",1f54c5b6-dcdd-4c16-9c06-04da83efe3b1
29,methods29," Some prospective studies registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov are currently ongoing to analyze the effects of ketogenic diets on the ratio between triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL), and on the composition of low density lipoprotein (LDL) subclasses with its long-term clinical outcomes in cardiovascular diseases.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform meta-analysis with RCTs to investigate the overall impact of ketogenic diets on glycemic control, weight loss, lipid control and cardiovascular and renal risk markers over varied low-fat dietary plans including low-calorie or high-carbohydrate diets. Based on our study results, patients with overweight or obesity and with underlying T2DM are more likely to receive benefits in terms of weight loss, improvement of glycemic and lipid controls from ketogenic diets.",26833a5f-1a1e-45b1-a153-e43ab5272580
30,methods30," Additionally, the clinical significance of a ketogenic diet in cancer patients is assessed in recent studies because diabetes-specific factors including insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia, which can be reversed by a ketogenic diet as shown in our study, play as biological links to site-specific malignancies, especially in breast, lung, kidney, and pancreas [60,61,62]. In light of numerous study results, a ketogenic diet can provide promising effects in many disorders including obesity, cardiovascular disorders, T2DM, and possibly cancer. Some questions, nonetheless, still remained to be answered before justifying the appropriateness of ketogenic diets as obesity treatment: long-term sustainability, safety, and clinical significance of cardioprotective and anticancer activity.",d28c98cb-91fc-43b9-8170-50dbbd92f10d
31,methods31,"   Our study results confirmed the efficacy of a ketogenic diet on improving metabolic control in patients with overweight or obesity, especially those with underlying T2DM, nevertheless some limitations need to be acknowledged. Meta-analysis was performed incorporating RCTs with different study design and control diets, albeit mostly low-fat based diets. Varying intervention durations were adopted in included studies. Some subgroup analysis may have been underpowered to detect a difference between groups owing to small sample size. Surrogate markers were used to explore the metabolic efficacy of a ketogenic diet, such as serum levels of FG, HbA1c, and lipid components, instead of evaluating more patient-important endpoints, such as cardiovascular and renal events, and other obesity-related morbidity and mortality.",095cf09e-4ba3-42eb-9ec3-3e2770bf97b3
32,methods32," However, the findings from this meta-analysis with respect to the impact of a ketogenic diet on those surrogate markers can validate and provide insight into the effects of a ketogenic diet on the more clinically important endpoints.   5. Conclusions A ketogenic diet was more effective in improving weight control and metabolic parameters related to glycemic and lipid controls in patients with overweight or obesity, especially those with preexisting T2DM, as compared to low-fat based comparator diets. Its effects on other risk markers, such as blood pressure, C reactive protein (CRP) and SCr were comparable to those of low-fat diets. Further studies are warranted to determine the long-term sustainability of a ketogenic diet and its effects on the more clinically important endpoints such as obesity-related morbidity and mortality.
