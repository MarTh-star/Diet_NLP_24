0,introduction0,"Mitochondria represent the hub of energy metabolism in virtually all nonphotosynthetic eukaryotes, being responsible for the reoxidation of the primary electron carriers via the respiratory chain which, in turn, is coupled to ATP synthesis. In mammals, the energetic balance of this system of oxidative phosphorylation (of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)) is modified in specific tissues and physiological conditions, notably in brown adipose tissue in the cold, where a large proportion of the energy yield from mitochondrial respiration is released as heat. Repurposing of the mitochondria for heat production involves a natural bypass of ATP synthase, in which protons extruded into the mitochondrial intermembrane space during electron transfer in the respiratory chain complexes are channeled back thermogenically into the mitochondrial matrix by uncoupler protein 1, UCP1 (reviewed by Chouchani et al. 2019).",80267ea4-ef3d-4235-ba4d-3073cb72d6c4
1,introduction1,"  Most eukaryotes, with the exception of vertebrates and some other fast‐moving animals, possess an alternative enzymatic machinery for mitochondrial respiration, bypassing specific of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes (Schertl and Braun, 2014; Rogov and Zvyagilskaya, 2015; Del‐Saz et al. 2018; McDonald and Gospodaryov 2018; Antos‐Krzeminska and Jarmuszkiewicz 2019). These alternative respiratory chain enzymes are also thermogenic, as famously documented in plants (Meeuse 1975; Wagner et al. 2008). The alternative respiratory enzymes include the alternative oxidase alternative oxidase (AOX), which bypasses the proton‐motive steps of respiratory complexes III and IV. When enzymatically active, alternative oxidase (AOX) catalyzes the passage of electrons directly from ubiquinol to molecular oxygen in a non proton‐motive reaction, which is thus thermogenic.",14a9a56e-7ff2-45da-a5e6-cdb7d136e689
2,introduction2," In those organisms endowed with it, alternative oxidase (AOX) is able to buffer stress in the mitochondrial respiratory chain resulting from genetic or physicochemical (e.g., oxidative) damage, overload, or inhibition by toxins (see recent reviews by: Del‐Saz et al. 2018, McDonald and Gospodaryov 2018). To ensure that its presence does not disturb electron flow in the respiratory chain under normal physiological conditions, it is only active when its electron‐donor substrate, ubiquinol, accumulates to abnormally high levels, indicating inhibition of the respiratory chain at a downstream step (Dry et al. 1989; Hoefnagel and Wiskich, 1998; Dogan et al. 2018). Various additional metabolic effectors, such as pyruvate, other organic acids and nucleotides can enable or potentiate the activation of alternative oxidase (AOX) in plants, fungi, and protists, although little is known of how alternative oxidase (AOX) is regulated in animals (McDonald and Gospodaryov 2018; Saari et al. 2019).",b77db503-575f-4197-b44e-800748a7b0f5
3,introduction3," The evolutionary loss of alternative oxidase (AOX) from vertebrates is a matter for speculation. If the enzyme were to become active under stress conditions, for example, in fight‐or‐flight situations or under starvation, it could impair survival. Alternatively, while plants and sessile invertebrates are unable to escape from a stressful environment, vertebrates can simply move somewhere else.  Based on the foregoing, we reasoned that the introduction of alternative oxidase (AOX) into humans or human cells might be of therapeutic benefit in diseases associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction (El‐Khoury et al. 2014). Moreover, this approach provides a useful tool to probe the involvement of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in diverse pathological models. We therefore introduced alternative oxidase (AOX) from the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, the organism phylogenetically closest to humans which has retained the alternative oxidase (AOX) gene, into human cells.",f079779c-ff1c-4d2d-87ba-18b28356ce4c
4,introduction4," Initially this was carried out in the HEK293T cell line . Subsequently alternative oxidase (AOX) was introduced into cells with of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) defects arising from RNAi treatment or from disease‐causing mutations . In these contexts, alternative oxidase (AOX) was efficiently expressed, targeted to mitochondria, shown to be enzymatically active and to mitigate defects arising from of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) impairment, such as metabolic acidosis, oxidative stress or poor growth on low‐glucose media.  Subsequently, Ciona alternative oxidase (AOX) was introduced into model organisms. Drosophila ubiquitously expressing alternative oxidase (AOX) was found to be viable, and to experience only minor effects on development and physiology under standard laboratory conditions, compared with controls. Similarly, two different lines of mice ubiquitously expressing alternative oxidase (AOX) (El‐Khoury et al.",ac9cc1c7-d0c7-42f5-a060-add653da3197
5,introduction5," 2013; Szibor et al. 2017) showed no significant deviations from controls, even when over 350 physiological, behavioral and metabolic parameters were measured. Nevertheless, alternative oxidase (AOX) was able to confer protection against various kinds of physiological stress, ranging from exposure to respiratory poisons such as cyanide or antimycin A (Fernandez‐Ayala et al. 2009; El‐Khoury et al. 2013; Szibor et al. 2017), genetically engineered of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiency (Kemppainen et al. 2014; Rajendran et al. 2019) pathological models related to oxidative, proteotoxic, nutritional, and proinflammatory stress (Fernandez‐Ayala et al. 2009; Humphrey et al. 2012; El‐Khoury et al. 2016; Mills et al. 2016; Giordano et al. 2018), or disturbed nuclear‐receptor and Jun‐kinase signaling .",dc96eaf4-3afb-4ba4-9b36-a32015cb35ad
6,introduction6,"  Nevertheless, flies expressing alternative oxidase (AOX) showed a slightly exaggerated weight loss in the early weeks of adult life compared with controls (Fernandez‐Ayala et al. 2009), suggesting the possibility that alternative oxidase (AOX) may become partially active at that stage, compromising the efficiency with which useful energy in the form of ATP is recovered from food substrates. Furthermore, under conditions of nutritional stress, alternative oxidase (AOX)‐expressing flies were impaired in their ability to complete development on low‐nutrient medium containing only glucose and yeast (Saari et al. 2019).  In mammalian models, nutritional limitation, such as by caloric restriction, has been successfully used to study aging, but more complex dietary experiments to identify specific nutritional requirements are problematic.",e8ca97df-64a7-4cac-ad4d-5592709bfb7a
7,introduction7," This is due, for example, to the large number of traits influenced by diet, the diversity of inbred strains, and the effects that may be mediated by the microbiome, especially in pathogen‐free facilities (National Research Council (US) Subcommittee on Laboratory Animal Nutrition, 1995). An alternative approach, which has been widely adopted in the use of mammalian models to study obesity and metabolic disease, is to feed animals on a diet containing a high content of fats and/or a low content of carbohydrates. Mice of susceptible strains (West et al. 1992; Champy et al. 2008) fed a high‐fat (HF) diet show increased weight and many physiological detriments, including cardiac dysfunction (Khan et al. 2010; Dirkx et al. 2011; Shuai et al. 2019), compared with those fed a control (chow) diet. Susceptible mice, such as of strain C57BL/6J, also show cardiac impairment (Nilsson et al.",71ea9916-5ef7-436d-af2a-073721070b6a
8,introduction8," 2016) when fed a high‐fat low‐carbohydrate diet usually described as ketogenic, since ketone bodies produced in the liver from dietary fat become the main metabolic fuel for organs normally dependent on sugars, such as the brain. When fed a ketogenic diet C57BL/6J mice have been reported to exhibit slower weight gain than controls when fed ad libitum (Thio et al. 2006) or with controlled isocaloric food intake (Kennedy et al. 2007). However, in a separate study no overall weight difference from controls was observed, despite altered body composition, with increased fat but decreased lean mass (Nilsson et al. 2016). Conversely, mice exposed for long periods to ketogenic diet have been shown to gain weight compared with chow‐fed controls (Ahola‐Erkkilä et al. 2010). Ketogenic diet has also been shown to lead to changes in the composition of the gut microbiome (Ma et al. 2018), which was suggested to minimize inflammation.",d1aaaee2-b241-490f-9f5c-5404b177c62b
9,introduction9,"  The findings with alternative oxidase (AOX)‐expressing flies under nutritional limitation led us to hypothesize that partial activation of alternative oxidase (AOX) could modify energetic balance in the mice in ways that would alter the response to dietary stress. Mouse models with increased energy expenditure typically have a lean phenotype, with decreased weight gain in fat‐rich diets. Examples are knockout of the Maf1 regulator of Pol III transcription (Willis et al. 2018), treatment with of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) uncouplers (Goldgof et al. 2014; Kalinovitch and Shabalina 2015; Suzuki et al, 2015) and genetic modifications that increase sympatho‐adrenal tone (Ruohonen et al. 2018). Thus, our expectation was that alternative oxidase (AOX) would also have this effect in mice.",e1b79168-44bf-4b93-8374-ca55a8beee17

Mouse body composition was measured using Dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DEXA) imaging system (GE LUNAR PIXImus2 imager) according to the guidelines of EMPReSS (RRID:SCR_003087). Before imaging, animals were anesthetized with a 1:1 mixture of pentobarbital (Orion Pharma, 100 mg/kg of body weight) and lidocaine (Orion Pharma, 16 mg/kg of body weight). Blood droplets were collected from the tail vein to measure glucose, lactate, and ketone‐body concentrations using Freestyle Precision (Abbot Laboratories, USA), Lactate Pro (Arkay, Kyoto, Japan), and Freestyle Precision metering instruments, respectively, according to manufacturer's instructions.

13,methods2," Male littermates were randomized into different diet groups and the diets were introduced 8 weeks after birth, this delay ensuring that they were already accustomed to solid food. Animals were caged in littermate groups (2–5 per cage) for the initial diet manipulation experiment. For the follow‐up experiment on ketogenic diet only, mice were caged individually in a different animal facility. Diets were standard chow (Teklad 2918, Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet, providing 24% of total calories from protein, 18% from fat, and 58% from carbohydrates); high‐fat (Teklad Custom Diet TD.06414, providing approximately 60% of total calories from fat, comprising 37% saturated, 47% monounsaturated, and 16% polyunsaturated) and ketogenic (Teklad Custom Diet TD.96355, providing 90% of total calories from fat with almost none (~0.5%) from carbohydrates).",fced3ffa-b7b1-40cc-a3c1-296b5bdeb405

18,results0,"alternative oxidase (AOX) does not affect patterns of weight gain in different diets We initially studied groups of alternative oxidase (AOX) mice and nontransgenic male littermates reared on three different diets: standard chow, high‐fat diet (60% of total energy from fats) and ketogenic diet (90% of total energy from fats, with almost no carbohydrates). Mice were transferred to these diets at 8 weeks of age, that is, approximately 4 weeks after weaning, prior to which they had been maintained on standard chow. Note that, in this first experiment, littermates were housed together, regardless of genotype. For convenience, the effects of high‐fat diet and of ketogenic diet on total body weight are shown separately (Fig. 1A, 1), although a single set of chow‐fed controls was used in the experiment. Three conclusions emerge. First, animals of both genotypes showed accelerated weight gain on high‐fat diet compared with standard chow during the first 10–12 weeks of the experiment.",b31e10f6-5805-49cb-9e2d-cd73738b16d7
19,results1," Thereafter, the rate of weight gain was essentially the same for animals fed on high‐fat as for chow diets. Second, there was no significant difference between genotypes on either high‐fat or chow diet. Third, we found that wild‐type animals reared on ketogenic diet gained weight at the same rate as those fed standard chow during the first 10 weeks of the experiment. Thereafter they began to gain weight faster than chow‐fed controls. alternative oxidase (AOX) mice also gained weight on ketogenic diet after 10 weeks. In addition, alternative oxidase (AOX) and wild‐type mice, despite being in the same inbred background, showed considerable phenotypic variation in the extent of weight gain. Moreover, the two groups were significantly different from each other between weeks 16‐35, with alternative oxidase (AOX) mice showing slightly less weight gain than wild‐type littermates.",b02e7c43-9791-4ce6-8b0b-a0324c7a8faf
20,results2," Because of the wide variation observed on ketogenic diet, this part of the experiment was repeated using a different caging protocol, where all animals were reared in separate cages, so as to minimize any behavioral issues. This produced a different result (Fig. 1C) in which weight variation within the groups was no longer evident. However, the amount of weight gain was once more slightly different between the two genotypes, except in this case in the opposite direction, with alternative oxidase (AOX) mice showing slightly greater weight gain on ketogenic diet than controls. Combined with the large variation seen in the first experiment, this leads us to infer that there was no systematic difference in the pattern of weight gain on ketogenic diet between the genotypes.

One obvious such variable could be the population of gut microbes, which has previously been reported to show systematic variation according to diet, although it is unclear whether such changes are adaptive or maladaptive. To address this issue, we sampled the microbiome of individual animals via a high‐throughput sequencing approach, then looked for statistically significant differences according to genotype, diet, or total body weight (Fig. 5, Tables [Link], [Link], [Link], [Link]).

In contrast, the present investigation aimed to determine the physiological effects of long‐term dietary stress on the alternative oxidase (AOX) mice which, based on findings in Drosophila, were expected to reveal clear differences from controls. Unexpectedly, the differences observed were minimal. Total body weight, overall body composition and, in the case of ketogenic diet, impaired cardiac function, were not systematically altered by alternative oxidase (AOX). alternative oxidase (AOX) also had only minimal effects on the gut microbiome.",99cca44d-eb79-4480-b0ed-0ebc03bd3e51
30,discussion1," The results stand in contrast to studies in disease models, where alternative oxidase (AOX) has been shown to have clear‐cut effects that could be either beneficial (Mills et al. 2016; Rajendran et al. 2019) or detrimental (Dogan et al. 2018) to survival.  Conditions for alternative oxidase (AOX) activation The simplest explanation for these findings is that alternative oxidase (AOX) remains enzymatically inert, even under the rather extreme conditions of ketogenic diet. alternative oxidase (AOX) is regulated by the reduction state of its substrate ubiquinol, being effectively outcompeted by of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex III (ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase) except when the reduced quinone reaches a substantial proportion of the total quinone pool (Dry et al. 1989; Hoefnagel and Wiskich, 1998); this has been verified for the Ciona enzyme when expressed in mouse, under conditions of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) deficiency (Dogan et al. 2018).",f5727979-b5d9-4310-bf2d-0a09cb22ace5
31,discussion2," In plants, alternative oxidase (AOX) is also regulated by pyruvate (Hoefnagel and Wiskich 1998; Sierra‐Campos et al. 2009; Carré et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2015) which affects its quaternary structure, and in diverse taxa by other organic acids (Siedow and Umbach 2000; Selinski et al. 2018), nucleotides (Sierra‐Campos et al. 2009; Selinski et al. 2018), and calcium (Mariano et al. 2005; Zalutskaya et al. 2015). Despite the metabolic disturbances resulting from fat‐rich diets (Barrington et al. 2017; Fujisaka et al. 2018; Hassan et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2018; Showalter et al. 2018; Tomášová et al. 2018; Gu et al. 2019), including the production of ketone bodies and many compounds included within or related to the aforementioned categories, it was not possible to determine whether or not alternative oxidase (AOX) was enzymatically active in vivo, during the present study. This would require the development of entirely novel, noninvasive methods.",8d61b154-6e73-4f87-9151-f3929a031910
32,discussion3," If the enzyme were shown to have become activated in mice fed a fat‐rich diet, its effects on energy yield would have to have been compensated by increased food intake, absorption or processing, or drastically curtailed activity, to have produced the observed end result of no effect on weight gain.  Our findings imply that the stressful effects of fat‐rich diets are not mediated by respiratory chain impairment at the level of complexes III or IV. Moreover, the fact that blood glucose and lactate levels are not affected by diet or by alternative oxidase (AOX) (Fig. 3) argues against an upstream effect at complex I. To unravel these possibilities will require further testing using controlled feeding and continuous metabolic monitoring, including tests of glucose tolerance.",edb2c3d8-941b-41a0-be99-3abd5440977f
33,discussion4," In contrast to our findings with alternative oxidase (AOX), a futile cycle of energy wastage has been proposed to underlie the resistance to high‐fat diet‐induced weight gain of Maf1 knockout mice, which show elevated RNA polymerase III‐dependent transcription (Willis et al. 2018).  Microbiome changes do not correlate with extent of weight gain on ketogenic diet Because food intake may be an issue, as discussed below, we considered the microbiome data in regard to multiple, potentially interacting factors: diet and genotype, (Table S7, Fig. 5C), and weight only (Tables S8, Fig. 5B). Our finding that there were no trends in the composition of the intestinal microbiota of highly obese mice compared with other groups, contrasts with previous findings which identified a correlation between changes in the microbiome and intestinal energy balance (Turnbaugh et al. 2006; Wichmann et al. 2013).",f2008e3e-6bad-495f-a4a7-4b72ad68d7ca
34,discussion5," Although it would be interesting to compare wild‐type chow‐fed animals with alternative oxidase (AOX) animals fed on ketogenic diet that were in the lowest weight gain group, the number of animals studied was insufficient for this further stratification to be reliably meaningful. This could be investigated in a follow‐up experiment, although it would be hard to justify, given the absence of any clear signal evident in the present study.  A previous study (Ma et al. 2018) reported specific changes in the microbiome produced by ketogenic diet, with increased abundance of taxa considered “beneficial” (Akkermansia muciniphila, Lactobacillus), and decreases in Desulfovibrio and Turicibacter, regarded as proinflammatory. One of these changes was seen in the present study, namely the decrease in Turicibacter (Tables S6), while Lactobacillus and Desulfovibrio showed opposite changes to those reported by Ma et al. (2018), and A. muciniphila was unchanged.",bf840c3a-ff99-43df-8e95-3fc7e66fd140
35,discussion6," The diet‐dependent decrease in Turicibacter was seen in both genotypes (Tables S7), but Turicibacter was already low in alternative oxidase (AOX) mice fed on chow diet, as was Desulfovibrio.  In a previous study using a similar approach, the microbiome of the most obese (“obesity‐prone”) versus the less obese (“obesity‐resistant”) wild‐type mice fed a high‐fat diet was found to differ (Gu et al. 2019). However, this experiment was performed on low numbers of mice (n = 3) and shows no coherence with our own findings using ketogenic diet. Note, however, that different primer pairs from those employed by Gu et al. (2019) were used in our study. Other authors have reported a correlation between metabolic disturbance, obesity, dietary fat, and the microbiome (Ke et al. 2019), as well as with behavior (Hassan et al. 2018). It remains unresolved whether the microbiome changes are the result of variations in these other parameters or are instrumental in producing them.",6a86a1f8-c109-42a9-9e36-b7d87d90753c
36,discussion7,"  Mice fed either of two antioxidants, Tempol (Jiang et al. 2015; Cai et al. 2016), or N‐acetyl cysteine (NAC Falach‐Malik et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2019), showed alleviation of diet‐induced phenotypes, together with alterations in the microbiome. Since alternative oxidase (AOX) has previously been inferred to be functionally equivalent to an antioxidant in Drosophila (Fernandez‐Ayala et al. 2009; Sanz et al. 2010), we looked for any changes in the microbiome of alternative oxidase (AOX) mice that were similar to those reported in the literature for NAC‐treated mice. Two of the most striking differences produced by NAC, especially in high‐fat diet, were increased amounts of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (Zheng et al. 2019).",34a9bc36-b879-4852-a42b-7e161a56b23c
37,discussion8," However, Bifidobacterium, like Lactobacillus, was actually decreased in alternative oxidase (AOX) expressors compared with control mice on chow diet (Tables S7), and was not significantly different between the genotypes on ketogenic diet (Tables S7) or when considered without regard to diet (Tables S5).  Other possible causes of weight variation in ketogenic diet In the first experiment, the large variation in total body weight on ketogenic diet increased with age, but was already a clear trend, if not yet significant, after 10–12 weeks (Fig. 1B). In the second experiment, the variation within the groups was modest even at 20 weeks, at which point the experiment was terminated. A reasonable assumption is that differences in the caging system (littermate groups vs. individual caging) are likely to underlie the different outcomes.",ea996786-4b04-4fbf-8c16-02d22c495dd3
38,discussion9," The wide variation in weight gain is logically a reflection of differences in energy expenditure and/or in feeding, for which behavioral interactions between males caged together are a logical explanation. Mice are highly territorial, and certain males can retain power over food intake of others (Ellacott et al. 2010). Since the outliers in the experiment (i.e., the most and least obese animals) were from multiple cages, this seems a more likely explanation than an unidentified external stressor, such as noise, vibration, or chemical exposure. In practice, it may be impossible to eliminate all possible sources of environmentally induced behavioral variation (Crabbe et al. 1999). Our study illuminates the value of repeating such experiments in a different environment before attempting to draw firm conclusions.  Caging male mice in groups (first experiment, Fig1B) or individually (second experiment, Fig.",b62dc821-19d0-4912-b691-e19df18f338f
39,discussion10," 1C) potentially has different behavioral consequences, either of which can be stress‐related. Whereas individual caging is considered a paradigm for social isolation (Võikar et al. 2005), animals caged in groups develop social hierarchies that can influence feeding behavior and lead to divergent patterns of weight gain, which has been extensively documented in rats (Tamashiro et al. 2007a, 2007b) as well as mice (Goto and Toyoda 2015; Razzoli et al. 2017; Keenan et al. 2018).  Genetic heterogeneity at loci other than the alternative oxidase (AOX) insert is an extremely unlikely factor to explain the wide variation in weight gain, since the animals had all been back crossed over >10 generations to a pure background strain, with fresh breeding animals sourced annually. In an unlikely scenario, if a relevant allele were present in just one or a few animals used for backcrossing, it could create undetected genetic variation.",662ba04b-cfa7-4251-a969-f70c09e5eed0
40,discussion11," However, it is then hard to account for the fact that variation in weight gain occurred in just one of two sequential experiments.  Implications for future therapeutic uses of alternative oxidase (AOX) One of the underlying reasons we conducted this study was to determine if alternative oxidase (AOX), proposed as a future therapy for many different diseases (El‐Khoury et al., 2014), would interact with “stressful” diets with high‐fat content to produce undesired physiological effects. In such a case, any therapeutic use would have to be conducted in combination with a strict dietary regime. Conversely, the prior data from Drosophila (Fernandez‐Ayala et al. 2009) suggested that alternative oxidase (AOX) expression might, under some circumstances, promote weight loss or mitigate diet‐induced weight gain and other detriments, via futile expenditure of energy. It was suggested that this might even be a viable treatment for obesity and other metabolic diseases.",e32a7cc9-3e19-4d31-bce7-1ae29102a7f6
41,discussion12," The results of the study would seem to exclude both propositions, at least as far as the C57BL6 mouse is concerned. However, extrapolating the findings to humans obviously must await future clinical trials, if alternative oxidase (AOX) passes other safety and efficacy criteria.
