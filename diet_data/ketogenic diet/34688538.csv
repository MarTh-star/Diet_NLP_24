0,background0, Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH)) is a severe neurometabolic disorder characterized by increased glycine levels. Current glycine reduction therapy uses high doses of sodium benzoate. The ketogenic diet (KD) may represent an alternative method of glycine reduction.  Aim  We aimed to assess clinical and biochemical effects of two glycine reduction strategies: high dose benzoate versus KD with low dose benzoate. ,1d40d10f-41e9-4068-b7d5-d1b6a2ac2aa8
1,methods0," This is a retrospective observational study that included 6 individuals with Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) from four different institutions who were treated with sodium benzoate therapy and the ketogenic diet as indicated based on their clinical status between 2019 and 2021 and continuing to the present. A retrospective review of the patients’ clinical history, laboratory results and brain magnetic resonance imaging studies was performed after obtaining informed consent. Studies of US patients were done in accordance with an IRB-approved study (COMIRB 05-0790). Per institutional rule, no further ethics committee review was required for the patient at the Groningen center. Consent for publication was received from all families.  All patients were first treated with high dose benzoate aimed to achieve target plasma glycine levels between 120 and 300 µmol/L [1, 20]. Patients initiated ketogenic diet typically with a 3:1 ratio per their local clinical protocol.",c0405214-326e-438c-80a1-55b214833a6c
2,methods1," During KD initiation, in anticipation of a rapid decline in glycine levels, the benzoate dose was reduced to half the initial dose and then titrated based on plasma glycine levels. Plasma glycine levels were obtained at 1–2 h after a benzoate dose in order to titrate therapy to achieve target glycine levels [1, 20]. Because our primary goal was glycine reduction, we followed plasma glycine levels primarily to guide dietary or ketogenic ratio adjustments, with quantitative assessment of ketones a secondary additional outcome parameter. Clinical assessments, including lumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, were repeated based on clinical status.",9eb882d6-7af4-4ee7-8a29-ecd2460269a5
3,methods2," To study endogenous glycine use, the glycine index was calculated as described from the dose of benzoate required to achieve plasma glycine levels in the target range and the dietary intake of glycine, using the equation: (Glycine index (mmol/kg per day) = [benzoate dose (mmol) − glycine food (mmol)]/weight (kg) (Fig. 1B) [20].  Brain glycine levels were evaluated using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Patients 1 and 2 underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies for patient 1 (through timepoint 4) and patient 2 were performed on a 3 T Philips Ingenia magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, while magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for patient 1 (timepoint 5) and patient 3 were performed on a 3 T Siemens Prisma Fit. Single voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with TE times of 35 ms and 144 ms was performed by placing a 1.5 × 1.",54d53157-3c3c-4ed2-9a0e-fe62ab730987
4,methods3,"5 cm voxel in two locations: medial basal ganglia and frontal white matter. The peak heights of glycine at 3.55 ppm and creatine were measured manually and ratios of glycine to creatine were calculated. Available magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) source data was post-processed using LCModel to obtain estimated metabolite concentrations [41, 42]. Control data on neonatal brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) glycine levels (displayed in Table 5) were extracted using identical processing from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data obtained over the basal ganglia of neonates imaged for possible hypoxic-ischemic injury, but who were later determined to have normal imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) findings. Data on white matter glycine levels were not available in these subjects therefore control white matter glycine levels could not be extracted.",8c22413b-a0da-4bf2-82b2-249364ba836f
5,methods4," The magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) derived glycine values in the basal ganglia were considerably higher than in the white matter. As a result, the error in the white matter signal was larger, making this result technically less reliable than that of the basal ganglia. The signal at short echo time 35 ms does not separate the peaks of myoinositol and glycine, which are well separated at an intermediate echo time of 144 ms. Signals using a long echo time of 288 ms could not be used for serial glycine quantification in Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), likely due to excessive interference over time between the 288 ms magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) signal and the evolving diffusion restriction in Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH). Unfortunately, due to a technical error, the values prior to treatment for patient 2 could not be analyzed by LCModel, and only peak height ratios are available.",6b2d1d84-5093-4147-9163-33a7251f4d35

7,methods6," Ketosis and a robust decrease in plasma glycine levels was noted in 24 h (Table 2), and repeat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed a decrease in glycine, serine and threonine (Table 4). Clinically, the infant’s seizures did not substantially improve, and lacosamide was added (in addition to continued use of clobazam and topiramate). While on the KD, the patient’s parents reported subjective improvements in her level of alertness and head control, and increased grasping of objects. On exam, she continued to have axial hypotonia, but her spasticity improved and her clonus resolved. At age 10 months, the patient was able to access a sugar-free formulation of dextromethorphan and higher levels of ketosis were achieved with a lower ketogenic ratio. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were repeated with no substantial change in brain glycine levels (Table 5).

The infant was able to roll in both directions and had good head control with only a minimal head lag. She had intermittent horizontal eye nystagmus but could fix and follow caregivers. She experienced multiple weeks in a row without seizures, but then would have a cluster of 4 to 5 tonic seizures in a day.  When the infant was 20 months (after 14 months on the KD), it was discontinued due to frequent vomiting and feeding intolerance experienced at higher levels of ketosis. High dose sodium benzoate therapy was resumed. A repeat lumbar puncture obtained shortly after the discontinuation of the KD as part of routine evaluations for break-through seizures showed a stable plasma and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glycine levels (Table 4). The patient remains on clobazam, lacosamide and levetiracetam.",5569e6a7-0576-4150-861a-109ea363ad86

Pyramidal signs remain absent on exam. She has severe cortical vision impairment and babbles, but has no words. A repeat Bayley assessment showed a gross motor functional age of 6 months and fine motor of 1 month equivalent. At 2 year 9 months, she can sit independently, and grasp and hold objects.  Case 2  Following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, the infant was noted to have encephalopathy and hypotonia at birth. She developed progressive respiratory failure and apnea requiring ventilatory support by 40 h of life. magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (obtained on DOL 5) (Table 5) and biochemical studies were consistent with a diagnosis of Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) and molecular testing revealed a missense variant in GLDC and an 8.",f2398ebf-798c-48d3-a82c-4cb2f2ec5789

Treatment was initiated on DOL 8 and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (repeated on DOL 18) showed reduced brain glycine levels (Table 5) which corresponded with clinical improvements in tone, encephalopathy, independent respiratory effort and feeding abilities. The infant developed focal and myoclonic seizures as well as burst suppression pattern on EEG. Levetiracetam was started with only a partial clinical response, thus a KD was initiated on DOL 30. cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain glycine levels assessed on DOL 37 on KD showed equivalence to those obtained while on high dose benzoate therapy (Tables 4, 5). Due to difficult to manage perturbations in serum electrolyte levels and frequent emesis the KD was discontinued after 1 week and high dose sodium benzoate therapy was resumed.",f8c646e9-fa7e-4ece-966c-71d912960dc2
11,methods10,"  Clinically, at age 13 months, the infant has made minimal developmental progress and is entirely gastrostomy tube fed, except for some tastes of purees for pleasure. She has periods of time when she is awake and alert, and able to focus her gaze on caregivers. She does not track and has presumed cortical visual impairment. She has axial hypotonia and has developed peripheral hypertonia. Though the infant has seizure-free days, on average, she continues to have tonic seizures that occur 1-2x/day and myoclonic seizures that cluster and can occur multiple times a day. She has significant neuro-irritability which has been challenging to manage.  Case 3  Following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, the infant presented on DOL 2 with progressive lethargy. Biochemical studies were consistent with Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) and molecular genetic testing revealed compound heterozygous mutations in GLDC (Table 1).",100762e5-be4a-4f66-9f34-d2d68a1eb557
12,methods11," magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (obtained on DOL 52) showed a small glycine peak (Table 5).  The KD was initiated at 6 months of age due to intractable epilepsy with seizures occurring on average 4–5 times/day on clobazam therapy, but as frequent as 30 times/day. The patient remains on clobazam, but since KD initiation she has experienced over the course of one month a significant reduction in seizure frequency with seizures occurring on average 4 times/week which was maintained. She has remained on the KD for 9 months. At age 15 months, she can hold her head upright for a few seconds and can occasionally roll from back to front. She cannot roll from front to back and cannot sit independently. She can hold and track large objects like a cup, but she is not tracking smaller objects. She smiles occasionally and makes vocalizations but has no clear words yet.

She presented at 10 weeks of life for evaluation of abnormal eye movements, a dysconjugate gaze, and abnormal motor movements Biochemical studies were consistent with the diagnosis of Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) and molecular genetic testing showed compound heterozygous variants in GLDC (Table 1).  The patient’s seizures improved with optimization of sodium benzoate and dextromethorphan dosing and after 10 days the patient demonstrated increased alertness and eye contact. The infant was followed as an outpatient and started on clobazam for seizures. She made some developmental progress with attainment of intentional smile, increased head control and improvements in oral feeding skills. In the second year of life, the patient’s seizure frequency worsened, and she developed abnormal, ballistic-like, fidgeting movements and self-harming behaviors.",04162059-5ab0-42db-a003-5aa050fde551
14,methods13," Additional antiepileptics phenobarbital and topiramate were added and the patient’s sodium benzoate was progressively increased up to 600 mg/kg/day due to poorly controlled glycine levels. During this time, she became dependent on tube feedings.  Given these progressive difficulties, the ketogenic diet (KD) was initiated at 26 months of age. Since KD initiation, the patient has been able to achieve stable glycine levels with a reduction in sodium benzoate therapy and discontinuation of topiramate without a need for additional antiepileptics. She has remained on the ketogenic diet for over two years. Her background EEG and seizure control have improved. She remains on clobazam and a low dose of phenobarbital. The patient’s behaviors have improved, she is more relaxed and has fewer abnormal movements. She displays increased eye contact and social engagement with verbal skills limited to babbling. She has improved head control and axial tone and is able to crawl.",e0868f9f-4dc1-4ce6-87f1-30d11f841c06
15,methods14," Overall, the patient has tolerated the KD well. During vomiting illness, she requires gastrostomy feeds and her sodium benzoate dose is decreased to avoid low glycine levels. She remains on citrate therapy for hypercalciuria.  Case 5  Following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, the infant presented with seizures at 2 weeks of life. In retrospect, hypotonia had been noted at birth. On initial presentation, the infant experienced clusters of 4–5 seizures in a cluster that occurred on average 7–10 times/day. Biochemical testing and molecular genetic testing were consistent with the diagnosis of Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH). (Table 1). By 6 weeks, treatment with sodium benzoate and topiramate was initiated and the patient showed improvements in attention, appetite and seizure frequency.  The infant was started on KD at 9 weeks of life as an adjunct to pharmacologic therapy for epilepsy. No apparent clinical improvements were noticed following diet initiation.",a1d419e7-56a4-4725-b53a-271d2193ab8d

He has clusters of 2–3 seizures/day and is managed on levetiracetam, clobazam and cannabidiol in addition to the KD. The KD is well tolerated and is taken by mouth in addition to solid foods. The infant remains globally severely delayed but is making slow progress with developmental therapies and can roll from stomach to back and push his head and upper body up when in a prone position. He has cortical visual impairment and nystagmus, but he is making progress in visual tracking.  Case 6  The infant presented at 2 months of life in the setting of a viral illness with lethargy, decreased oral intake and abnormal movements. In retrospect, he was reported to have been unusually sleepy during the first weeks of life which was attributed to a difficult, vacuum-assisted, delivery.

Subsequent biochemical evaluations were consistent with the diagnosis of Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) and confirmed by molecular studies (Table 1). Upon receipt of this diagnosis, treatment with vigabatrin was discontinued (due to its association with developmental regression in individuals with Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) [1, 44]) and clobazam was initiated, in addition to sodium benzoate therapy. The infant’s seizures initially improved and became less intense, but by age 5 months the seizures again increased in frequency and became associated with activity, prompting a dose escalation of all antiepileptic therapies.

The effect occurred rapidly within 24 h concurrent with onset of ketosis, and thus a prompt adjustment of benzoate dosing was required. We recommend halving the benzoate dose at initiation of KD.  Despite apparent improvements in plasma biochemistry with glycine levels in the low normal range, the impact on the target organ, the brain, as measured via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was less robust.",a29711ff-8a58-49a7-b76c-b8050aa7c16e
34,discussion1," Independent of the method used, benzoate or KD, a reduction in plasma glycine corresponded with a reduction in brain glycine levels as assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) by approximately one third in the basal ganglia and by about half in the white matter (Table 5). Despite this significant reduction, levels still remained elevated above normal levels.  A reduction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glycine has been reported in previous studies [29–34]. While strongly reduced, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glycine levels still remained elevated to above the normal range for patients 1, 2 and 4, who had serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained on benzoate therapy, and for patients 1 and 2 on the KD. This differs from what was demonstrated in the Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) mouse studies, where brain glycine levels normalized with benzoate treatment [23].",3eb999a7-6c6b-4e51-86d5-76b5fb1ee904
35,discussion2,"  The likely mechanism whereby KD causes this reduction in the glycine pool lies in the use of glycine for gluconeogenesis elicited by the strong carbohydrate restriction. Thus, as a glycine reduction strategy the target of the KD in Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) is not ketosis but rather glucose restriction, although the ketosis could have additional benefits as well. This increased endogenous usage of glycine for gluconeogenesis is reflected in a markedly reduced glycine index and associated reduction in the required dose of the benzoate (Table 2). This alters the equilibrium between the endogenous synthesis of glycine and catabolism via the glycine cleavage system in a substantive way (Fig. 1B). This gluconeogenetic use most likely involves a two-step process, first the conversion of glycine to serine by serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and then the use of serine dehydratase enzyme to provide pyruvate for gluconeogenesis (Fig. 1A).",d998dd6b-fbdf-45cb-bdf5-300f83ee778a
36,discussion3," The decreased levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serine and threonine (Table 3) likely are reflective of their gluconeogenic metabolism to pyruvate through serine dehydratase and threonine dehydrogenase respectively. This exacerbates the already low serine levels in Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), but the differential impact on the stereoisomers D-serine and L-serine has not been examined [45]. The transformation of glycine into serine involves serine hydroxymethyltranferase enzyme using 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. It is unexplained why the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate and homocysteine measured while on KD in patient 1 remained normal (Table 3).  The critical enzyme in this mechanism, serine dehydratase, is highly expressed in the liver [48], but is not expressed in the brain [49]. Glycine-N-acyltransferase, which is critical in the mechanism of glycine conjugation to benzoate, is also expressed only in liver and secondarily in the kidney.",756886c6-e53c-470f-b9e1-2c2101d51bcf
37,discussion4," Thus, the mechanism of glycine reduction in both benzoate therapy and KD involves enzymes that act through the liver, but not the brain. The expression of key enzymes in the liver but not the brain explains why both methods of glycine reduction were able to bring plasma glycine levels to the low normal range but did not fully correct brain glycine levels, and why these methods demonstrate equivalency in terms of brain glycine lowering capacity. We infer that it is thus unlikely that other measures that correct plasma glycine levels in the liver, such as liver-directed gene therapy or liver transplantation, will not fare any better at correcting brain glycine levels [23].  It is remains unclear which of the two methods of glycine reduction is clinically advantageous. The correction of plasma glycine levels on KD appeared to be more robust and stable than with benzoate; however, these data show equivalence in brain glycine lowering.",146666b1-8d82-494e-9571-c74c2514ab6f
38,discussion5," Similar to what has been published about benzoate therapy [4, 21, 35–37], both methods appear to result in similar limited neurological clinical improvements in terms of increased alertness, easier epilepsy control compared to untreated, and some improvements in neurodevelopment. Patients 3, 4 and 6 showed objective improvements in seizure control with initiation of the KD, patient 4 exhibited significantly improved behavior and patient 1 displayed subjective improvements in her mental status and demonstrable improvement in her tone and degree of spasticity. The KD was trialed for just a 1-week period in patient 2, so it is difficult to draw conclusions on its clinical impact, whereas other patients remained on KD for at least 6 months with persistent beneficial impact. Given the limited duration of the study, the long-term impact of the combination of the KD and low dose sodium benzoate therapy on the clinical and biochemical stability remains to be documented.",fa181d10-d8a0-4629-8005-730f66a0abf1
39,discussion6,"  As for adverse effects, high dose benzoate therapy has a repugnant taste, carries a risk of gastric irritation, and of accidental overdosing with benzoate with potential life-threatening toxicity [20, 35, 36]. Benzoate acceptance is poor particularly in adult patients, and glycine control is often very variable, as reflected that even with good effort glycine levels in several patients on high dose benzoate were above the intended target range. The KD requires close subspecialty and dietary follow-up to avoid nutritional deficiencies and higher levels of ketosis may result in feeding intolerance as seen in patients 1 and 2. The KD also requires more effort and, in some cases, cost on the part of parents and caregivers to maintain when children are not formula fed, yet, half the families preferred KD over benzoate for the long term. Secondary biochemical effects of both therapeutic approaches should also be considered.",cd1b0793-9df2-4596-b9c8-6f89a1573a95
40,discussion7," As discussed above, there are indications that KD may exacerbate cerebral deficiency of serine and of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and the clinical impact of this is unknown. Presently, given our limited sample size and the observational nature of the study, our results do not clearly advocate for one method of glycine reduction over the other, and this will need to be addressed in future studies. Instead, clinicians in consultation with caregivers will need to evaluate the described benefits and risks and assess whether the KD be considered for each patient on a case-by-case basis. A guide to practical initiation KD in Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) based on our experience is provided in Fig. 2.Fig. 2 Proposed protocol for initiation of ketogenic diet in nonketotic hyperglycinemia  There are several limitations of this study resulting from its observational nature.",7139f224-e45f-4d92-bc75-f4cf53a9d4a8
41,discussion8," Standardized tools for collection of clinical exam findings, developmental quotients and parent reports were not employed nor were EEGs obtained at standardized timepoints and recall bias on seizures numbers cannot be excluded. Only two patients had serial lumbar punctures and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies. These factors limit our ability to draw definitive conclusions regarding the clinical impact of the KD. Ideally, prospective clinical controlled studies will be required to evaluate this. This study included mostly patients at the severe end of the phenotypic spectrum. Future studies should include more patients with attenuate-intermediate phenotypes (such as patient 4) and attenuated-good phenotypes, where KD may have greater clinical benefit.",ece31534-f091-4752-8ae5-782561119134
42,discussion9," Given, its potential impact on neurocognitive symptoms [50], including mood, attention, and sleep quality, in addition to seizures, the effect of the KD on individuals with Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) who are higher-functioning is of interest. Such prospective study can also document appropriate benzoate dosing in this KD setting for patients of varying Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) severity.  Brain glycine measurement using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with LCModel analysis could be a potential new biomarker for the study of Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) and should be explored in a systematic study. Basal ganglia brain glycine levels were more elevated than white matter brain glycine levels at the time of diagnosis. This difference remained stable over the treatment course even over a 6-month period in patient 1.",2af5cdbb-5bcd-46d3-9452-2da6e02805ed
43,discussion10," Regional differences should be explored in postmortem brain and using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technology in Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) patients, which may provide insight into both the pathogenesis of specific types of neurologic symptoms in Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) and what clinical parameters are likely to be most sensitive to therapeutic manipulations of brain glycine levels. Control data documenting normal glycine levels in different brain tissue types as measured via brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will be valuable to properly compare the efficacy of different therapeutic interventions [51, 52].  In conclusion, the ketogenic diet with low dose benzoate therapy is an effective glycine reduction therapy for nonketotic hyperglycinemia. Compared to high dose benzoate, it was more effective at lowering plasma glycine levels. Both methods equally lowered brain glycine levels by about a third to half.",3a2f7ebd-1607-4ef5-901a-d30c061462fe
44,discussion11," Still, brain glycine levels remained elevated above levels seen in controls. Since both methods act through liver-mediated enzymatic reactions, complete correction of brain glycine accumulation will likely require a different mechanism that is more cerebral biochemistry based such as brain-based gene therapy or other brain-based biochemical manipulations. Brain glycine levels using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with LCModel analysis should be explored as a biomarker of the impact of new therapies in Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH).",9f247a0e-a2e0-4ce3-ad73-4041af1294db
