0,methods0," Data of all pediatric patients (<18 years old) who had been prescribed a Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) to treat a confirmed or suspected GLUT1DS in a tertiary care level hospital between January 2009 and August 2020 were collected. A GLUT1DS was suspected in patients with seizures or movement disorders associated with hypoglycorrhachia. The diagnosis was confirmed when SLC2A1 mutations were found.  It is a retrospective and prospective (since May 2015) observational descriptive study approved by the Committee for Ethics in Clinical Research of the University Children´s Hospital Niño Jesús (project identification code R-0002/15, date of approval 25 February 2015). Patients or their relatives were informed of the aims of the research and signed an informed consent. All data were collected anonymously. Full medical histories were reviewed to collect epidemiological data, symptoms, genetic disorders, and treatments used before the diet´s implementation.",9fcdfa2f-bd82-4888-80c6-c7f4b6f1962b
1,methods1,"  classic ketogenic diet (CKD) was indicated for patients younger than 3 years or with severe epilepsy. modified Atkins diet (MAD) was selected for children older than 3 years. Both types of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) were introduced slowly, increasing the ketogenic ratio progressively, adjusting according to the patient’s tolerance and the appearance of adverse effects, without fasting or liquid restriction. We started Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) as an inpatient regime when a classic ketogenic diet (CKD) was selected, the patient was <2 years, or the child did not live in proximity to medical care. The hospital admission provided more time to teach the caregivers, monitor ketosis, and manage side effects. We started Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) as an outpatient when a modified Atkins diet (MAD) was selected, the patient was >2 years and the family had been previously trained in diet management and could easily access the hospital in case of side effects.",0ed6c07e-e95d-4588-a230-3bf58686ad79
2,methods2," Nutrition expert nurses designed the diets and trained the caregivers in meal preparation and management of side effects. The recommendations of the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) based on age and weight were used to estimate energy and protein requirements. Protein intake was calculated according to daily protein recommendations (generally 1 g per kilo per day in children over 1 year and 1.5 in children under 1). We used the Holliday and Segar method [11] to estimate minimum fluids requirements, although we always prescribed at least the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation or more to decrease some adverse effects of the diet such as constipation, acidosis, dehydration, or hypercalciuria. classic ketogenic diet (CKD) was started as a 1:1 ratio. The next day, the ratio was increased to 2:1, and the next day to 3:1.",62bde791-320d-43c5-ab73-4a6a7b3b5166
3,methods3," If tolerance was not good or adverse effects appeared, the ratio was lowered again and then we tried to reach the 3:1 ratio more slowly. Infants younger than 6 months were on a liquid diet based on Ketocal®. Older infants and children were on a diet based on natural foods supplemented with a fat emulsion consisting of MCT (Liquigen® or MCT Oil Nutricia®) or with powders or liquids rich in lipids and low in carbohydrates, based on whey protein supplemented with amino acids and micronutrients (Ketocal®). For the onset of modified Atkins diet (MAD), the reduction of carbohydrates in the diet was first recommended. The caregivers were then given a list of foods indicating how many grams of carbohydrates they contained, the amount of carbohydrates the patient had to eat each day, and sample menus. In addition, they were recommended to supplement the diet with specific formulas (Ketocal®) to achieve a 0.8–1.1 ratio.",4b38f90b-602c-44c9-b45c-aea0b67500cb
4,methods4," Caregivers had written information about the menus, the glycemia and ketonemia controls that they should carry out, the management of adverse effects, and the drugs that they could use in case of common illness in childhood such as fever or respiratory infections and that they do not affect ketosis. Families could also make telephone inquiries in case of doubts. The caregivers were instructed to perform urine ketone tests every 8 h during the first days of the diet. Glycemia and beta-hydroxybutyrate were also monitored using test strips. These controls were carried out once or twice a day during the first weeks. Once a stable situation was reached, controls were carried out 3–4 times a week. The frequency of the controls was increased when the patients suffered secondary effects or associated diseases.  All patients underwent a thorough examination before Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) and then after the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th month, and then yearly.",27f3fc6b-c5d4-4e85-a732-4f4ac41de3ff
5,methods5," In each medical examination, possible side effects were accounted for. Weight, height, head circumference, and body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) were analyzed. Parameters were adjusted by sex and age according to the growth charts of the World Health Organization (WHO) (except head circumference in children older than 2 years, for whom the Spanish charts were used). Laboratory assessment included complete blood count, biochemical and lipid profiles, gasometry, ions, urinary sediment and calcium, protein, and citrate/creatinine ratios, prealbumin and retinol binding protein (retinol binding protein (RBP)), vitamins A, E, D, B12, B9, zinc, selenium, carnitine, and parathormone (parathormone (PTH)).  Two groups were compared according to the SLC2A1 mutation (SLC2A1 (+) or (-)-group) and according to symptoms (the epilepsy group or movement disorder group).",ad86a432-9cb3-4141-b132-9fcebcbf5a13
6,methods6," The effectiveness was measured by the reduction in number of seizure (100% (seizure freedom), 90–100% improvement, 50–90%, <50%, 0% (no improvement), or an increase in the number of seizures) and anti-epileptic drugs (anti epileptic drugs (AEDS)) in the epilepsy group, and by a reduction in the intensity and frequency of movement disorder.  Variables were registered in an Excel program table. All statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS version 16.0. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the z-score values for weight, height, and body mass index (BMI), and blood and urine markers, at baseline and throughout the follow-up intervals. The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare the effects of the different Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) on blood and urine markers.",d15abdae-925f-4218-a800-3a07877f7602
7,methods7," Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the efficiency according to the type of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT), and two groups were compared based on the existence of the SLC2A1 mutations and type of symptoms (seizures versus movement disorder).  3. Results  The characteristics of the 18 patients recruited are shown in Table 1. SLC2A1 mutations (SLC2A1(+)) were found in six patients (33.3%), five had seizures, and one had exercise-induced paroxysmal dyskinesia. Two patients had de novo deletions on chromosome 1 (130 Kb and 1.69 Mb, respectively) that affected the SLC2A1 gene. A heterozygous pathogenic variant in SLC2A1 was identified in three children. One was de novo mutation c.388G > A (p.Gly130Ser). In the other two patients, the same mutation was found in relatives: c.823G > A (p.Ala275Thr) was found in an asymptomatic brother and in the asthenic mother; and c.1232A > G (p.Ans411Ser) was identified in the asymptomatic mother.",c7ee4e22-321a-420b-b882-4c5590be6131
8,methods8," In one patient who was followed in the neurology department of another center, the specific mutation of the SLC2A1 gene was not registered in the medical record. Twelve patients were SLC2A1(-). Disturbances in other genes were found in six, and 4/6 had epilepsy. A one-year-old girl started with myoclonic seizures related to the mutation c.2813G > A (p.Arg938His) in GRIN2B (glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2B). Alterations in GRIN2B may cause intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism, and sometimes microcephaly, movement disorder, cortical visual impairment, and occasionally cortical developmental malformation. A boy had a neonatal epileptic encephalopathy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures associated with the heterozygous mutation c.619C > T (p.Arg207Trp) in KCNQ2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 2). Mutations in KCNQ2 can cause neonatal seizures to severe neonatal epileptic encephalopathy.",000ea56d-29aa-44ca-ab61-f36c9e0fc82b
9,methods9," A two-year-old girl began with absences related to the de novo mutation c.T277delGC (p.Ala93Glyfs*113) in SLC6A1 (Solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, GABA), member 1). SLC6A1 mutations may produce cognitive impairment and epilepsy. The most common seizures are absences, myoclonic, and atonic seizures. GRIN2B-, KCNQ2-, and SLC6A1-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A one-year-old boy debuted with focal epilepsy due to a de novo mutation in chromosome Xq26.3, which led to disturbances in SLC9A6 (solute carrier family 9 member A6) associated with Christianson syndrome (intellectual disability, epilepsy, ataxia, and postnatal microcephaly). The remaining two children were a girl with the de novo mutation c.",df0949c5-c2d8-46ac-99f5-5d75c8e2d25d

NKX2-1-disorders are associated with choreoathetosis and hypothyroidism.  Median age at debut was lower in the SLC2A1(+)-group (1.7 ± 1.7 versus 2.2 ± 2.2 years), and in the epilepsy group (1.8 ± 1.5 versus 2.7 ± 3.2 years). The mean of cerebrospinal fluid to the blood glucose ratio was 0.45 (0.24–0.61). This ratio was lower in the SLCA1(+)-group (0.39 ± 0.1 versus 0.49 ± 0.09). These differences were not statistically significant.",8d835630-4b93-448b-b908-951a426c8d5c
11,methods11,"  Almost one third of the children did not have seizures (Table 1), and 13 had developmental delay or a cognitive disability. The mean of baseline seizures in the epilepsy group was 3/day, and 9/13 children had seizures daily. The mean of anti epileptic drugs (AEDS) used in the epilepsy group was 3.8 (range 1–8), and 12/13 children with seizures had been treated with at least 2 anti epileptic drugs (AEDS) before the onset of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT). The most often tested anti epileptic drugs (AEDS) before Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) were: Valproic acid (12/13), levetiracetam (8/13), clobazam (6/13), and lamotrigine (6/13). Just before starting the diet, only three patients were taking only one anti epileptic drugs (AEDS). One patient was on a Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) previously, but it was withdrawn due to the side effects and loss of efficiency.",ff39e054-da64-43d4-8914-6c63610f4192
12,methods12," Three patients did not improve with other treatments (coenzyme Q, vitamin C, and riboflavin; vitamin B6 and adrenocorticotropic hormone; vitamin B6).  The characteristics of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) are shown in Table 1. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the median age at the onset of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) was higher in SLC2A1(+)-group (8.8 versus 4.9 years), and in the epilepsy group (4.5 versus 3.5 years). The median time from clinic debut to the onset of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) was longer in the SLC2A1(+)-group (7.1 versus 2.7 years) (p = 0.039). All diets were administered orally. modified Atkins diet (MAD) was used in 5/6 children SLC2A1(+) and 7/12 SLC2A1(-). All classic ketogenic diet (CKD) were started in children younger than 3 years, except one SLC2A1 (-)-girl with CLIFAHDD syndrome who started a classic ketogenic diet (CKD) in another hospital.",621f8b49-e8b8-4d03-8711-df9f31602407

In 3 SLC2A1(-)-patients, Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) were modified to improve compliance: 2 classic ketogenic diet (CKD) switched to modified Atkins diet (MAD) (13 days and 17 months later), and 1 modified Atkins diet (MAD) switched to a low glycemic index treatment (after 19 months).  Ketosis (>2.4 µmol/L) was reached in a mean of 3.8 days. No significant differences were found depending on the type of diet or the gene mutation in the time needed to reach ketosis. However, beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were higher in patients following a classic ketogenic diet (CKD) at 3 months (p = 0.",cc83e512-f957-432c-8764-c349f2975686

Outcome of the Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT)  Figure 2 represents the flow chart with the evolution of the patients of the study. Patients who responded to the Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) are shown in Figure 3.  In epilepsy group, seizure-free patients were 6, 5, 6, and 7, and subjects with a reduction in the number of anti epileptic drugs (AEDS) were 3, 4, 3 and 2 at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively.  The mean of the anti epileptic drugs (AEDS) taken by the patients was 1.9 (±0.8) at 3 months, 1.5 (±0.7) at 6 months, 1.4 (±0.9) at 12 months, and 1.3 (±1.2) at 24 months. Throughout the follow-up, 4, 5, 5, and 6 patients, at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, were taking ≤1 anti epileptic drugs (AEDS).",e03f39b0-35b1-4f24-b7bb-ef169f9097b8
15,methods15," Seven patients with epilepsy were on a Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) for more than 2 years (3 SLC2A1(+)), all of them had 90–100% improvement, and 3 of them were on a Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) for 6 years or more.  In the movement disorder group (n = 5), 4 children had a good response at 3 months. At 6 months, 2 patients were still on Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) (2 had the diet withdrawn, one due to non-compliance and one due to a high level of transaminases and the negative result of SLC2A1). Only one patient with a movement disorder due to the CLIFAHDD syndrome was still on a classic ketogenic diet (CKD), 6 years after the onset.  No significant differences were found in either in the reduction of seizures and anti epileptic drugs (AEDS), nor in the improvement of the movement disorder according to the type of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) or SLC2A1 mutation.  3.2. Side Effects  Six children (33.",9cb7b7f5-5537-4e43-96db-75e2765b3362

Long-term adverse effects are shown in Table 2. A higher risk of adverse effects was not found according to the type of diet, but significant differences were found in some blood and urine markers. The most clinically important were found in cholesterol (higher in patients on modified Atkins diet (MAD) at 3 months (p = 0.045)) and calciuria (higher at 3 months in patients on a classic ketogenic diet (CKD) (p = 0.011)). Only one girl on a classic ketogenic diet (CKD) with CLIFAHDD syndrome had nephrocalcinosis at 24 months.  3.3.

17,methods17," Only one patient was severely malnourished at 12 months, and one child was overweight, and one was mildly malnourished at 24 months. Mild disturbances in height were found in one child baseline, and in 2 at 6 months, and 3 at 12 and 24 months. Baseline mean z-score (SD) of body mass index (BMI) and height were −0.26 (1.6) and −0.63 (1.1), respectively. Throughout the follow-up, mean z-score (±SD) of body mass index (BMI) was: −0.20 (0.93), −0.30 (0.99), −0.30 (1.5), and 0.03 (1.4). Height data were: −0.65 (0.64), −0.70 (1.08), −1.2 (1.6), and −1.3 (1.5) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. No significant differences were found in anthropometric parameters throughout the follow-up compared to baseline, nor by the presence of the SLC2A1 gene mutation or the type of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT).  Nutritional markers and micronutrients are shown in Table 3.",99b45ca2-a89d-4318-b942-e29aa246cb3b
18,methods18," At the baseline, the following nutrients were deficient: Vitamin D (3 patients), selenium (2), phosphorus (2), folic acid (1), and vitamin B12 (1). Throughout the follow-up, only two children had a vitamin A deficiency, one patient had a vitamin E deficit, and another one a vitamin D deficit. No significant differences were found in nutritional markers in blood except in phosphorus levels, which were significantly lower at 3 months (p = 0.007) and at 12 months (p = 0.028), compared to baseline.  Calcium at 3 months (p = 0.01), and prealbumin (p = 0.05) and folic acid (p = 0.025) at 12 months, were significantly higher in patients on classic ketogenic diet (CKD).  4. Discussion  GLUT1DS is a rare metabolic disease and its clinical presentation is heterogeneous [3,12,13]. Among our patients, epilepsy was the most frequent symptom. Various types of seizures were described, as in other studies [14,15], but the most frequent were myoclonic seizures and absences.",08cc6c0d-9185-4dc9-95fb-9e895c6ac571
19,methods19," Almost a third of the patients in our study had a motor disorder. Dystonia and paroxysmal movements were the most frequent movement disorders in our cohort. In one case, paroxysmal movements were paroxysmal exertion-induced dystonia. A high clinical suspicion is necessary for diagnosis since early treatment is important, because those patients who began Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) at a younger age had better outcomes [16,17]. When GLUT1DS is suspected, the SLC2A1 gene should be tested. However, some patients with compatible symptoms and a good response to treatment do not have mutations in SLC2A1 [2,18]. We used Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) in all our patients despite not having a definitive diagnosis because they had hypoglycorrhachia. Furthermore, the presence of a motor disorder increased the chances of being a GLUT1DS.",13e95217-65cf-46a7-a8e6-b3dcc3d77c98
20,methods20," On the other hand, almost all children with seizures had refractory epilepsy, and Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) should be considered when two anti epileptic drugs (AEDS) have failed. In our cohort, only six patients with GLUT1DS suspected were finally confirmed, but most children benefited from Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT). The time from debut to the onset of the diet was greater than 3 years. This time was estimated to be more than 8 years in some papers [13,17]. The age at the onset of symptoms was lower in our patients with epilepsy and in the SLC2A1 (+)-group, and the time from debut to the onset of treatment was significantly higher. Most studies describe a delay of at least 4 years from debut to the onset of the diet [13,17,19]. Therefore, Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) should be onset when a GLUT1DS is suspected, although the definitive diagnosis is not made.",d213334f-dce8-463b-b6ee-2a15ff871705
21,methods21,"  The current standard treatment for GLUT1DS are the Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT), especially the classic ketogenic diet (CKD) [4,6,12,19,20]. Recent reviews have reported that 60% of the patients were seizure-free after the implementation of the diet, and 80% of patients with movement disorders improved [3,13]. In our cohort, 31–54% of patients with epilepsy were seizure-free, and 80% of patients with a movement disorder improved.  Although classic ketogenic diet (CKD) is the most accepted treatment, two-thirds of our patients were treated with modified Atkins diet (MAD), and no significant differences in efficiency were found according to the type of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT). Several case reports describe the use of modified Atkins diet (MAD) [8,9,21,22], and Amalou and coworkers [10] evaluated the effectiveness of modified Atkins diet (MAD) in 10 patients with GLUT1DS: Epilepsy improved in all patients, and movement disorders also enhanced. Fujii et al.",8765f72f-42e5-401f-b8f7-21ceb4c9375e
22,methods22," [23] presented the outcome of 39 patients with GLUT1DS. modified Atkins diet (MAD) and classic ketogenic diet (CKD) were used respectively in 17 (55%) and 11 patients (35%), and both were effective on seizures and movement disorders. modified Atkins diet (MAD) may be as effective as classic ketogenic diet (CKD) for the treatment of confirmed and suspected GLUT1DS according to our results and those of the authors mentioned [10,23].  When a GLUT1DS is confirmed, Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) should be used life-long. However, classic ketogenic diet (CKD) is a very restricted diet, and non-compliance is a frequent reason for withdrawal, as reported a while ago [13] and recent [19] referring figures of 18%. Considering that modified Atkins diet (MAD) may be as effective as classic ketogenic diet (CKD), and that modified Atkins diet (MAD) is less restrictive, the type of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) chosen should be individualized [24].",43c684b0-18cf-498b-9e49-e34b6c613159
23,methods23," Curiously, the three patients who abandoned the diet due to difficulties in compliance in our study were on a modified Atkins diet (MAD). A possible reason that justifies difficulties in compliance of modified Atkins diet (MAD) may be the age of the patients, since the mean age at the onset of modified Atkins diet (MAD) was higher. classic ketogenic diet (CKD) is usually indicated for young children in whom it is easier to control the diet since it is based on liquid formulas or mashed foods. However, as the child grows, the child’s tastes can cause difficult compliance. All children who withdrew the diet in our study due to non-compliance were older than 3 years. Another cause that can lead to poorer compliance is the non-confirmation of GLUT1DS, which occurred in 2 of the children.  The adverse effects of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) are quite common. Digestive [25,26], hepatic [26], and kidney problems [27,28,29] can appear, but are generally mild and easy to manage.",5a358010-c9e1-49e0-a331-337f5065f4c4
24,methods24," In our cohort classic ketogenic diet (CKD) seems to be as safe as modified Atkins diet (MAD). Dyslipidemia [30,31] and kidney stones [27,28,29] are some of the most relevant long-term side effects. Hypercholesterolemia was very frequent in our cohort, but no patients were treated with lipid-lowering drugs, and, although classic ketogenic diet (CKD) has a higher fat content diet, cholesterol was significantly higher in children who were on a modified Atkins diet (MAD) in the first few months. Dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk have been studied. Short-term effects (after 12 weeks) on body fat distribution in 10 children affected by GLUT1DS, showed no alteration in the abdominal fat distribution [32]. Long-term, Heussinger and co-authors [33] followed 10 children and observed that the initial dyslipidemia may be transient, and they concluded that Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) do not increase long-term cardiovascular risk.",14b21a02-c3ce-4120-ad3c-5f815b3f10a1
25,methods25," Hypercalciuria was also common, but only one case had nephrocalcinosis in our cohort. All children with hypercalciuria were treated with oral citrates that prevent kidney stone formation [29], but may lead to bone mineral loss. It should be noted that urinary calcium/creatinine ratio was higher in patients on a classic ketogenic diet (CKD). Therefore, permanent monitoring of urine calcium/creatinine levels should be done in all patients on a Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT), but it is especially important in those on a classic ketogenic diet (CKD).  Deficits have been described in plasma levels of selenium, magnesium, carnitine, and vitamin D in patients with refractory epilepsy and Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) [34,35,36], but few studies have been performed in patients with GLUT1DS [37]. All our children took a carbohydrate-free multivitamin and mineral supplement from the beginning of the diet, as established in current guidelines [24].",14df7abc-2457-40d2-b486-dfdcab4e6ff1
26,methods26," Mild deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins were found, and low phosphorus levels appeared in some patients. Frequent monitoring of nutritional markers and micronutrients in blood was important to detect these alterations early and prescribe other supplements when necessary.  The effects of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) on growth have been widely studied, but it remains controversial. Several studies have shown that children on a Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) for more than 6 months decreased their growth rate [38,39,40,41,42], especially younger children [39]. Recent studies showed that 20–30% of children on Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) could have growth retardation [43,44,45]. The decrease in growth may be reversed after patients are taken off the Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) [46], but Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) in GLUT1DS should be used life-long.",2b4eb93e-4d7e-468f-84a5-19e2bfb451f5
27,methods27," Long-term treatment with Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) can significantly affect height, especially in those children who start the diet before the age of 2 years [47]. Ferraris and co-authors [43] retrospectively investigated the occurrence of linear growth retardation in 34 children on a Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT), 20 of them with GLUT1DS, of which 16 did not show growth retardation at 12 months. A prospective study was designed by Armeno et al. [48] to evaluate growth in 45 children on a Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT). They observed growth deceleration in 9%. In our study we did not find significant differences in the z-score of weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) according to the presence of the SLC2A1 mutation, nor in the baseline or throughout the follow-up.",98fbac1d-e6f3-4ad6-a734-442afac02431
28,methods28," No significant differences were found in those anthropometric parameters after the onset of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) compared to baseline, and according to the type of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT). However, our cohort is small, and the number of patients treated with each type of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) was not the same, so more studies (even multicenter) should be performed to determine the effect of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) on growth in children with GLUT1DS.  5. Conclusions  GLUT1DS should be suspected in children with hypoglycorrhachia in the setting of normoglycemia and low-to-normal cerebrospinal fluid lactate, and refractory epilepsy or movement disorders, especially if they occur during exercise or fasting. In these cases, the analysis of the gene SLC2A1 should be performed and Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) started. Children in whom the genetic study is finally negative, may benefit from treatment.",f3077db4-c9b7-43c4-94f4-66441abe5a63
29,methods29," Furthermore, a delay in the treatment could lead to progressive neurological deterioration and they may be treated with ineffective and potentially harmful pharmacological treatments.  Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) for confirmed or suspected GLUT1DS should be initiated as soon as possible. No significant differences were found between different types of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT). modified Atkins diet (MAD) was as effective and safe as classic ketogenic diet (CKD) in our cohort, so the type of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) chosen should be individualized. Side effects and deficiencies in vitamins and minerals can appear, but were usually mild an easy to treat in the study, so permanent monitoring is important. Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) should be used life-long in confirmed GLUT1DS. However, the effect of Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) on growth remains controversial.
