0,introduction0,"Concussions are the leading form of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The CDC reported the U.S. population sustains 1.7 million concussions annually and, although underreported by as much as 80%, the annual rate of concussion has more than doubled in the past decade (1). Evidence-based clinical management of concussions, therefore, is of particular relevance. While 90% of patients have resolution of symptoms within 4 weeks, the remainder experience persistent and oftentimes debilitating symptoms for months or even years (2), a condition termed post-concussion syndrome (post concussion syndrome (PCS)) (3). Unresolved cognitive or memory problems can significantly limit daily activities and have potentially neurodegenerative consequences later in life (4). Currently, treatment is aimed at symptoms but rarely addresses the underlying injury. This is an important limitation in treating post-concussion syndrome and can lead to prolonged recovery periods.",66705e2b-d453-4de2-b4a1-dd7ed3cc351a
1,introduction1,"  The brain is a highly metabolic organ that requires substantial and uninterrupted energy, usually supplied by glucose. Glucose uptake is severely diminished in the metabolic cascade that occurs after a concussion injury (5), resulting in a condition of brain hypometabolism that can persist for months (6). Correction of this bioenergetic deficit may serve as a potential therapeutic target for underlying post-concussive symptoms. One such approach, the high fat, carbohydrate restricted ketogenic diet (KD), reduces reliance upon glucose metabolism in favor of metabolism of ketones, the body's alternative energy substrate. Ketones contribute significantly to cerebral metabolism (7–9) which, perhaps most importantly, appears to remain intact in conditions with impaired glucose metabolism (10–12).",146f6d80-a139-4463-bb45-5ee79d9c9c67
2,introduction2,"  The KD is used effectively for children with intractable seizures (13–16) and has gained significant interest as a possible therapeutic approach in other neurological conditions with a growing number of studies demonstrating a potential neuroprotective role (17–20). Our recent data also suggests that the KD offers symptomatic benefit in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (21), a condition with a similar observance of hypometabolism due to decreased brain glucose consumption (22, 23). In AD, it is suggested that raising levels of serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the primary circulating ketone body, to 0.5 mmol/L is sufficient to bolster brain metabolism (24). KDs and circulating ketones also have purported signaling properties (25), reduce oxidative stress (17, 26, 27), decrease systemic inflammation (28), and promote mitochondrial function (29).",658e684f-e66f-4064-b16b-73c79781f1f5
3,introduction3," In animal TBI models, ketosis-inducing nutritional approaches have been demonstrated to have neuroprotective benefit (30–35) and promising improvement in cognition and behavior (31, 32). Acutely post-TBI, cerebral ketone concentration is elevated and can be modulated through administration of ketosis-inducing nutrition (36). Elevated cerebral ketone concentration could be indicative of a metabolic adaptation to ketone metabolism in the early stages of TBI. Given the existing mechanistic evidence, human clinical investigation into the KD's potential as a therapy in TBI is warranted.  The primary purpose of the present study was to establish feasibility of implementing an 8-week KD in patients with post concussion syndrome (PCS) symptoms. Our secondary aims were to assess changes in cognition and self-reported symptoms coincident with the KD treatment.",8a46f359-c4d2-4989-8161-6389ec257377
4,introduction4," We hypothesized that patients would be compliant with the 8-week KD protocol, identified by monitor of dietary intake and two measures of ketosis, and that compliant participants would experience improvement in cognitive performance and symptomology.

5,methods0,"The Ketogenic Diet in Post-Concussion Syndrome (KD-post concussion syndrome (PCS)) was a single-arm, pilot clinical study with a target enrollment of 14 subjects with Post-Concussion Syndrome (post concussion syndrome (PCS)). The protocol required participants to maintain an medium chain triglyceride (MCT) supplemented KD for 8 weeks. The KD was isocaloric and increased dietary fat to offset decreased carbohydrate consumption, thus we refer to our diet as a very high-fat KD (VHF-KD) to distinguish our diet from a calorie-restricted, low carbohydrate KD.  We prospectively recruited participants from The Center for Concussion Management clinics in the Neurology and Trauma Surgery Departments at The University of Kansas Health System.  Participants Participants all had post concussion syndrome (PCS) defined as having suffered a concussion resulting from a direct blow, rotation, or whiplash injury to the head or body.",6c83d62e-e86d-4d97-b538-bb352916ed50

Individuals were required to have a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) of >21 kg/m2 and have mastery of the English language. Only patients between the ages of 18–65 years old were considered for participation. A complete metabolic panel which included electrolytes, liver function tests (LFTs), and blood glucose levels, hematology, insulin, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and cholesterol levels were collected and reviewed after consent but resulting lab values did not determine eligibility. Exclusion criteria included serious medical risks such as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, ongoing cancer, or recent vascular event (i.e., stroke, heart attack, angioplasty, etc.",c6ef913c-599c-45d8-85e9-5e1fa96ec14f

The KU Medical Center's Institutional Review Board approved the protocol. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants as per institutional guidelines.  Dietary Intervention Participants received nutrition counseling from the study registered dietitian (RD) at the baseline study visit. They were counseled to consume a self-selected, 1:1 ratio (ratio of grams of lipid to grams of non-lipid) VHF-KD in which energy was derived of 5–10% carbohydrate, 70–75% fat, and 20–25% protein. Dietary principles of the VHF-KD have been previously described (38) and are presented in Table 1.",edc4ca72-2c6b-4ad2-9ff3-71695faf171d
8,methods3," Participants were encouraged to consume a medium chain triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) oil (NOW Foods, USA) containing a combination of C8:0 and C10:0 fatty acids. To promote medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil tolerance, dosage started at 1/2 tablespoon/day for the first week and increased by 1/2 tablespoon weekly until reaching a goal of 1–2 tablespoons/day based on individual tolerance. Energy needs were determined using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation (39). Weight loss was discouraged in this study, thus energy needs were adjusted as needed during the intervention to prevent excessive weight loss among participants. Provided materials included a VHF-KD diet manual containing a description of dietary principles and sample recipes, a 2-month supply of medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, and a daily multivitamin (Kirkland Signature, USA) to address potential micronutrient deficiency concerns.

The ImPACT test was administered at the study baseline visit as well as at the month 2 visit.  Symptom Evaluation Participants completed a Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (Post Concussion Symptom Scale (post concussion syndrome (PCS)S)) checklist at all three study visits. The Post Concussion Symptom Scale (post concussion syndrome (PCS)S) is a self-reported assessment of 22 symptoms using a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 6, with 0 indicating no difficulty with the outlined symptom and ratings of 1–6 representing mild-to-severe difficulty with the symptom.

We also assessed depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline and at the study conclusion. To assess severity of depression symptoms, participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a 9-question survey that asks questions about depression symptoms over the previous 2 weeks (40). Each question is scored 0–3 and summed to form a maximum score of 27 with higher scores relating to more severe depression symptoms. We assessed anxiety symptoms using the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, a 7-question, self-reported anxiety survey that has been validated for the general population (41).

The M-BESS tests an individual's postural stability on a firm, flat surface in three different stances: double-leg, single-leg, and tandem gait. The test is performed barefoot with eyes closed and hands placed on the hips. Each stance has a maximum score of 10 and 1 point is subtracted for each mistake. Total M-BESS scores are calculated by summing the scores of each stance.  Statistical Analysis The primary aim was to report feasibility of the VHF-KD in patients with post concussion syndrome (PCS) with a secondary aim of reporting preliminary efficacy.

However, for the purpose of this feasibility study, we did consider this participant to be compliant with the diet due to elevated serum BHB levels at months 1 and 2 and reported adherence to the target macronutrient composition via 3DFR. Future KD trials should embed strategies within the study design to encourage compliance with collection of ketosis measures to ensure better characterization of KD compliance and determine necessary depth and duration of ketosis for efficacy.

29,discussion4," The composition of the VHF-KD consumed in this study is similar in composition to the VHF-KD we previously studied in AD (38). Mean non-starchy vegetable intake increased one full serving while maintaining carbohydrate restriction. We have previously suggested that attention to diet quality may extend the putative benefits of the KD in neurological conditions (44). Non-starchy vegetables are an excellent source of micronutrients, are low in energy density and carbohydrate, and should be consumed in large quantity in a high quality KD.  We also observed improvement in the visual memory domain of the ImPACT test and a 9-point mean improvement in self-report of concussion-related symptoms, an improvement with suggested clinical relevance (45). These improvements should be interpreted with caution given that this was a single-arm study and outcomes measures were secondary aims.",3c17c8a7-3660-449e-8b04-6388ac43bdcb
30,discussion5," Vestibular-ocular impairment is observed post-concussion (46) and may contribute to deficit in visual memory, one of the most observed symptoms in concussion patients which may persist in patients with post concussion syndrome (PCS) (47, 48). Due to its consistency as a symptom post-concussion, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the visual memory domain may be one of the most profound to be affected by effective therapies. Our study also complements two animal studies that demonstrated improved cognitive function related to ketone-inducing dietary approaches. Appelberg et al. reported that 7 days post-TBI, rats fed a KD had better improvement than those on a regular diet in motor and cognitive function via the Morris Water Maze task and beam walking assessment (32).",7d8d52bc-0189-4835-9d32-1a1e243b1a62
31,discussion6," This finding was age-dependent as the improvements were observed in rats that received head trauma 35 days post-natal and not in rats that received head trauma 75 days post-natal; an effect speculatively due to resilience to energy metabolism deficit and quicker conversion to ketone metabolism in young vs. old rats (33). The second study demonstrated that rats fasted for 24 h immediately post-concussion had elevated ketone bodies at 24 h, performed better on the Morris Water Maze task at 10 days, and had more cortical tissue at 15 days (31). Other studies suggest that acutely post-TBI, adolescent rats fed a KD have improved cortical contusion volume 1 week post-injury (49) and reduced anxiety and depression symptoms (50).  post concussion syndrome (PCS) is still not well-understood.",b912810b-4c70-4240-b672-efeb7c77a881
32,discussion7," The condition itself is defined by concussion-related symptoms that persist beyond the course of normal concussion recovery, commonly persisting beyond improvement of physiological biomarkers of existence of mTBI (3). Acutely after mTBI, cerebral perfusion (51–53) and glucose metabolism become impaired (54). This hypometabolic state is typically corrected within a few days to a week; however, limited evidence suggests chronic impairment of these mechanisms as a compelling explanation for sustained symptoms. Under normal conditions, cerebral blood flow (cerebral blood flow (CBF)) is coupled with the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose to meet brain energy demand. Immediately following mTBI, cerebral blood flow (CBF) decreases (55) followed by hyperemia and later uncoupling of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolism (56) that persists in those with post concussion syndrome (PCS) (57).",780bf659-c0e0-4919-95c4-ed0ad0244707
33,discussion8," The metabolic implications of this cascade leading to chronic reduction in brain glucose metabolism may be an underlying cause of symptoms in patients with post concussion syndrome (PCS) (58). If so, post concussion syndrome (PCS) shares a similar hallmark with AD (59), a condition in which ketone metabolism mechanisms and potential therapeutic value of the KD have recently been studied with some extensity (10, 21, 24, 60). It is possible that AD and post concussion syndrome (PCS) share the common thread of underlying cerebral glucose hypometabolism, potentially rescuable through exchanging glucose metabolism in favor of ketone bodies and its downstream metabolic effects (28). We are unable to assess mechanisms through which the KD may influence cognition or symptom change in this study.  We also consider other mechanisms by which the KD and ketone bodies, independently, may be beneficial in post concussion syndrome (PCS) (44).",d2520338-7d33-4213-a20f-fc0b16a8f973
34,discussion9," Ketone body metabolism is suggested to produce fewer reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) than glucose metabolism and KDs, specifically, have been shown to upregulate mitochondrial antioxidant systems that scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity may reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related mitochondrial damage and preserve mitochondrial function. In a ketotic state, mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (uncoupling proteins (UCP)) are upregulated, enhancing energy production derived by the electron transport chain (electron transport chain (ETC)). Evidence also suggests that the KD upregulates the anti-inflammatory pathway, nuclear factor-E2 (Nrf2). Through both direct effects and preserved mitochondrial function, KDs and ketone bodies may also improve regulation of brain neurotransmitter levels.",2b3a392d-6aa5-49d0-81fa-91d06c139dd9
35,discussion10," Considering the evidence for KDs and ketone bodies, it would be desirable to know whether potential benefit in patients with post concussion syndrome (PCS) would require adherence to the KD or if other ketone-generating approaches, such as medium chain triglyceride (MCT) or exogenous BHB supplements alone, are sufficient.  Our group's previous success with implementing the VHF-KD in an AD clinical trial (21) provided preliminary experience with and adaptability to the potential challenges faced at both the individual and systemic level in this study. The diet education provided to participants in this study was refined from the previous AD study to portray a simple message and empower participants to follow a VHF-KD that fit their food preferences and proficiency for food preparation.",5e5884e2-9c47-45d4-afa4-95986a4d142d
36,discussion11," In addition to a 3-day sample menu adjusted to each participant's energy needs, we provided nearly 100 KD-friendly recipes with variable time allocation and skill requirement along with recommended recipe resources. Through this process, we've found that one of the simplest guides for success with the KD is to use Ketostix readings as an immediate feedback mechanism; if no ketone presence is detected, then the participant's actionable step, using the principles of a well-formulated KD, is to simply consume additional fat and further restrict carbohydrate the following day. Contrasting the participants from this study with the previous AD study, compliance is likely more attainable due to patient independence without the need of a study partner and the associated burden for a study partner to implement the diet.",6cdea6b6-1e2b-491e-af6b-a951c7d47e40
37,discussion12," On the other hand, some participants in this study required a significant level of contact with the study team to remain compliant with the KD, seemingly due to memory-related symptoms suffered from the patient's concussion.  The KD is most well-known as an effective treatment in refractory epilepsy (13–16). It is important, however, to distinguish the KD used for treatment of epilepsy and other conditions in which the KD may also be valuable as a treatment. Patients with epilepsy use the KD to maintain seizure control and it has been suggested that, in some cases, serum BHB levels must reach ≥4.0 mmol/L for this benefit (61). The KDs in these particular circumstances are strict and require carbohydrate restriction of ≤2% of energy and consumption of ≥90% of fat as energy (44). Compliance with a diet of this macronutrient distribution within free-living adults with a condition of brain bioenergetic disruption is likely not feasible, nor necessary.",b173d3f3-cd48-4297-a18a-3bcdb7c84c46
38,discussion13," Patients with AD improve overall cerebral metabolic rate with modest ketosis approaching 0.5 mmol/L (24). If these mechanisms overlap, we hypothesize that the majority of our participants raised their serum BHB to a level that may have been sufficient to contribute as a substrate for brain metabolism.  We also acknowledge limitations that reduce our ability to interpret feasibility and outcomes in this study. Participants performed daily self-monitoring of ketosis by urine acetoacetate strips, which presents two limitations. First, self-report is subject to inaccurate reporting by the participant. Second, although urine acetoacetate measurement is positively associated with blood-derived measurement of ketosis (62), capillary measurement of BHB by fingerstick is a more sensitive measure of circulating ketones and should be considered as a measurement in future KD trials. We also assessed serum BHB levels in the morning after a 12 h fast at only two time points during the intervention.",c3ddd315-b332-45d8-bfcd-380bbd6e1e46
39,discussion14," From this limited assessment, we are unable to elucidate whether serum BHB levels may have been highest at this point due to a fasting effect, or whether serum BHB levels may have been higher after consuming the KD due to consumption of fat substrate for ketogenesis. The direction of post-prandial BHB response is influenced by compliance to the KD macronutrient profile. Measurement of capillary BHB at multiple, varying timepoints would provide better insight for characterization of dietary compliance and general ketone status. Finally, this is a small pilot study that aimed to test feasibility of the KD in individuals with post concussion syndrome (PCS). Lacking a control group, we encourage caution in interpreting the results of this study as we are unable to determine if coincident changes in cognition and reported symptoms were due to the KD intervention.",69f5c0d1-017f-4270-8453-bd21d09df455
40,discussion15,"  The KD-post concussion syndrome (PCS) was designed to assess feasibility of a VHF-KD in patients with post concussion syndrome (PCS) and confirms that adherence to a VHF-KD in this population is feasible. Due to the small sample size and single-arm design of the study, we are unable to conclude that the VHF-KD was responsible for observed improvement in visual memory or report of symptoms. We urge caution in interpreting our coincidental findings. However, the results from this study do suggest potential for the KD to benefit patients with prolonged symptoms due to concussion and warrants future studies to investigate the KD as a potential therapeutic approach.
