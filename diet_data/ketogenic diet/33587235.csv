0,methods0," Inclusion Criteria of Studies for Our Analysis  Participants of Studies  Patients who were newly diagnosed with ISs without receiving any hormonal treatments before enrollment were eligible for our review and analysis.  Intervention and Trial Design of Studies  Based on our knowledge about hormonal therapy for ISs, the topics of relevant clinical trials could be grouped into categories as follows: (1) adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) vs. oral or intravenous corticosteroids, (2) comparison of different dosages of hormonal therapy, (3) hormonal therapy vs. vigabatrin (VGB), (4) hormonal therapy vs. other treatments, and (5) hormonal therapy alone vs. combined treatments. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with double-blind, single-blind, and open-label designs that studied the above topics were considered for inclusion.  Outcomes of Studies  Studies included in our analysis must report the complete cessation of spasms as one of the clinical end points.",848862f9-1b4c-4566-bb3a-d9bc446b5836
1,methods1," Remission of hypsarrhythmia on epileptic spasms neurodevelopmental regression and hypsarrhythmia on the electroencephalogram (EEG), relapses, as well as developmental outcomes were expected to report, but these outcomes were dispensable for a study to be included or not.  Safety and Tolerance  The AEs were documented.  Data Sources  This study was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA)) guidelines (13). The electronic databases, including EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)), were searched from database inception to April 26, 2021, to identify the published data. The search strategies (shown in Supplementary Material 1) were developed specially for each database, and the keywords were adapted according to the configuration of each database.",ea3c0e5b-4d83-406b-9e0b-6ce43c6cb913
2,methods2," Online trial registers, including NIH ClinicalTrials.gov, metaRegister of Controlled Trials, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)), were searched to identify ongoing trials or unpublished trials. The search terms, including “infantile spasms” and “West Syndrome,” were used when searching online registers. Searches were not limited by language, date, or publication status.  Assessment of Risk of Bias, Data Extraction, and Synthesis  The risk of bias of RCTs was assessed by two independent authors using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool (14). Briefly, six domains of bias, namely, selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias, were rated. Studies with all domains to be rated as low risk were considered to have a low risk of bias.",03c94a11-3d7a-4d81-86ba-1f68bd124d23
3,methods3," If one or more domains were rated as unclear risk, and the other domains were at low risk of bias, the studies were considered as having unclear risk of bias. One study was considered to have a high risk of bias if one or more domains were rated as having a high risk of bias.  The data, including authors, publication year, sex ratio, treatment protocols, the number of patients on each treatment arm, the number of patients achieving spasm cessation and electro-clinical response, as well as AEs, were extracted by one author and confirmed by two other review authors. The electro-clinical response was defined as the complete cessation of spasms with epileptic spasms neurodevelopmental regression and hypsarrhythmia on the electroencephalogram (EEG) remission of hypsarrhythmia. Review Manager version 5.3 was used for calculations of data synthesis. For dichotomous outcomes, such as electro-clinical response and AEs, the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI was calculated after data synthesis.",a5888aab-8763-4576-a7c4-329d0a50d24f
4,methods4," Statistical significance for RR was defined as 95% CI not containing 1. For crossover RCTs, only results of the initial stage were synthesized and analyzed.  Network Meta-Analysis  To gain a better understanding of the performance of treatments with no head-to-head trials with adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), a network was generated through joint treatments. Network meta-analysis was conducted using MetaXL (version 5.3). Each direct comparison was wrapped in the MAInputTable function (IOType = “NumRR” and Method = “IVhet”), and then the MANetwork function was used to perform network meta-analysis. Consistency H was calculated at the same time. ",3ea69e3a-1bb8-4ede-b629-d740c2c2573b
5,results0," Study Selection and Characteristics  In total, 507 records were identified in the initial search; 98 were removed due to duplications. Through title and/or abstract screening, 352 were excluded. After perusing full texts, 38 records were excluded, and the reasons for exclusion are listed in Figure 1. Overall, 19 RCTs (comprising 1,279 patients), which were conducted between 1983 and 2021, met our inclusion criteria. The characteristics of the included studies are presented in Table 1. All studies were alleged as RCTs; however, only twelve and nine studies provided sufficient descriptions on random sequence generation and allocation concealment, respectively. We accepted that blinding of participants and care providers could not be done in most circumstances as two interventions were given through different routes. Only one study, Hrachovy et al.",f617f035-68e0-4d61-8035-cf6e07335d5e
6,results1," (5), used a double-blind design, and five studies applied a single-blind design by masking personnel to treatment protocols when analyzing epileptic spasms neurodevelopmental regression and hypsarrhythmia on the electroencephalogram (EEG) results. The remaining studies were open-label randomized trials. Judgments about each risk of bias item are presented in Figure 2. Although only nine out of 19 studies reported electro-clinical response (defined as complete cessation of spasms with epileptic spasms neurodevelopmental regression and hypsarrhythmia on the electroencephalogram (EEG) remission of hypsarrhythmia) as the primary outcome, corresponding epileptic spasms neurodevelopmental regression and hypsarrhythmia on the electroencephalogram (EEG) results were documented as one of the secondary outcomes in all other studies except for Omar et al.

Adrenocorticotrophic Hormone vs. Oral Corticosteroids  Six RCTs that compared adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) with oral corticosteroids for the treatment of ISs, with 323 participants included, met our inclusion criteria (5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 15). Three of these RCTs, namely, Hrachovy et al. (5), Baram et al. (7), and Sardar et al. (15), used low-dose corticosteroids (2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or prednisolone). The other three RCTs, namely, Lux et al.",a5e349f7-16c9-4683-98ed-ba1b15fd0215
17,results12," (9), Wanigasinghe et al. (11), and Gowda et al. (12), applied high-dose prednisolone (4 mg/kg/day or 40–60 mg/day). The forms (natural or synthetic analogs) and dosages of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) varied in these trials. The primary comparison of Lux et al. (9) was between hormonal therapy and vigabatrin (VGB), so the secondary comparison of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and prednisolone might be underpowered. Meta-analysis revealed that the effectiveness of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and corticosteroids on electro-clinical response was comparable, regardless of the dosage of corticosteroids (Figure 3).  Figure 3 Forest plot showing risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI of electro-clinical response between adrenocorticotrophic hormone (adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)) and oral corticosteroids.  Hrachovy et al.",e2cc5b01-b477-427d-92c7-aafb655eecc0
18,results13," (5) reported that six (25%) patients had hypertension (>140/90 mmHg) during the initial and crossover stages, of which four developed at both stages and two developed only when receiving prednisone. After 2 weeks of the initial stages, 10 of 16 patients who received serial CT scans showed evidence of cerebral shrinkage, such as increased ventricular size and/or increased subarachnoid space, but no comparisons were made between treatment groups. Lux et al. (9) reported that 11 (36.7%) patients in the prednisolone group and 8 (32.0%) in the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) group had hypertension (>120/90 mmHg). Glycosuria was found in one patient in the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) group. In Gowda et al. (12), the incidence of AEs in the prednisolone group was 20% compared to 16.6% in the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) group, but details about the profile of AEs were not reported.

Adrenocorticotrophic Hormone Dosage  Three RCTs that compared the effectiveness and safety of different dosages of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) were included in our analysis (6, 8, 10). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients achieving electro-clinical response between high- and low-dose groups (RR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.60–1.47, Figure 4). However, the patients in the high-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) treatment group had a higher incidence rate of AEs (RR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.08–2.71, Figure 5).

The occurrence of AEs, including increased appetite, weight gain, Cushingoid features, and infections, was higher in the high-dose group but did not reach a statistical significance.  A recent open-label RCT, Kapoor et al. (17) explored the feasibility of shortening the treatment course by using methylprednisolone pulses (methylprednisolone pulses (MEP)).

Patients in the methylprednisolone pulses (MEP) group took less time to achieve remission (mean 5.4 ± 0.9 vs. 9.5 ± 2.6 days, p < 0.0001). However, 6 (19.4%) patients who received methylprednisolone pulses (MEP) had spasm recurrence, compared to none in the oral prednisolone group. Therefore, by 6 weeks, the proportion of patients who had epileptic spasms neurodevelopmental regression and hypsarrhythmia on the electroencephalogram (EEG) remission was significantly lower in the methylprednisolone pulses (MEP) group (45.2 vs. 75.9%, p < 0.015). Increased appetite (65.5 vs. 3.2%) and weight gain (75.9 vs. 16.1%) were more common in oral prednisolone group (p < 0.05), whereas sleep disturbance (61.3 vs. 20.7%, p = 0.0014), hypertension (35.",c800ea9f-6271-4b92-952a-30ff58d19b11

Hormonal Therapy vs. vigabatrin (VGB)  Of three included RCTs that compared hormonal therapy to vigabatrin (VGB) (9, 19, 26), Vigevano and Cilio (26) included 4 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)), with three assigned to vigabatrin (VGB) arm and one assigned to hormone therapy arm and all four patients responded to treatments, whereas Omar et al. (19) included 2 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) without reporting treatment assignment and response. The combined result showed that adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) had a more favorable effect than vigabatrin (VGB) on cessation of spasms (RR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.05–1.64, Figure 6). Both Vigevano and Cilio (26) and Lux et al.",8e483892-aca7-48fb-8553-33e190448dcd

25,results20," The other 69 patients who were not eligible for the RCT were allocated in the PC (37 KD and 32 adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)). The proportion of patients achieving the primary outcome, i.e., electro-clinical remission, was similar between KD and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) groups (RCT 62 vs. 69%; PC 41 vs. 38%; combined cohort 47 vs. 48%). There was also no difference in time taken to electro-clinical remission between KD and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) groups. The relapse rate was similar between treatment arms in the RCT but lower for KD in the PC (KD 0 vs. adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) 50%, p < 0.001). The frequency of overall AEs was not different between KD and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) groups (42 vs. 45%), but medical interventions to treat AEs were significantly less required in the KD group (30 vs. 94%, p < 0.001).  Another RCT investigated the effectiveness of oral zonisamide for ISs compared to adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) (21).",c0846872-33aa-4187-b3f7-b9c71ace8644

At 6 weeks of treatment, more patients had epileptic spasms neurodevelopmental regression and hypsarrhythmia on the electroencephalogram (EEG) remission (zonisamide 5/14 vs. adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) 10/14, p = 0.14). Patients of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) group had significantly better hypsarrhythmia scores, which were assessed via the Jeavons scoring system. Predominant AEs of patients receiving zonisamide were lethargy and irritability. One case required dose reduction due to metabolic acidosis, and one case withdrew the medication due to significant loss of appetite.

O'Callaghan et al. (23) was an open-label RCT that studied whether the combination of hormonal therapy and vigabatrin (VGB) was superior to hormonal therapy alone. The type of hormonal therapy (i.e., prednisolone or tetracosactide depot) was randomly assigned or chosen by parents. Spasm cessation on days 13 and 14 was achieved in 166 (89%) of 186 patients treated with combination therapy compared to 132 (69%) of 191 patients on hormonal therapy (95% CI 11.8–28.6; χ2 = 23.2; p < 0.001). Electro-clinical remission was achieved in 123 (66%) patients on combination therapy compared to 104 (55%) who were allocated to hormonal therapy (95% CI 1.4–21.6; χ2 = 5.2; p = 0.023). Time taken to reach spasm-free was shorter on combination therapy than hormonal therapy [median 2 days (interquartile range (IQR) 2–4) vs.",e13f86bd-ceba-4a03-8a2b-6888f9cca1be
29,results24," median 4 days (IQR 3–6); z = 6.04; p < 0.001]. No significant difference in AEs was found between groups (117 in the combination therapy group and 111 in the hormonal therapy group).  Kunnanayaka et al. (24) was an open-label RCT to explore whether the addition of pyridoxine to prednisolone could offer more benefits to patients with ISs. All 66 eligible patients received 30 mg/kg/day of pyridoxine for 3 days before the commencement of the study. Four patients were excluded due to marked improvement after the initial pyridoxine trial. The proportions of children with electro-clinical remission on day 14 were not significantly different (monotherapy 28.1% vs. combination therapy 30.0%, p = 0.87). The AEs in both groups included increased appetite, irritability, weight gain, Cushingoid facies, and excessive daytime sleepiness, but no patients were required to withdraw the treatments.",8175d0bb-66aa-438f-9c32-c0cffde72196
30,results25," Follow-up of the patients who were spasm-free showed that 4 patients relapsed in the prednisolone group and one relapsed in the combination therapy group after 1 month of treatment.  Yi et al. (25) was an RCT that studied whether the addition of topiramate (topiramate (TPM)) to prednisone was more beneficial for patients with ISs or late-onset epileptic spasms. Cessation of spams at day 14 after treatment entry was achieved in 28 (71.8%) of 39 patients on prednisone and in 29 (76.3%) of 38 patients on combination therapy (χ2 = 0.205; p = 0.796). Among these patients who were spasm-free, 21 of 28 patients in the monotherapy group and 20 of 29 in the combination therapy group achieved electro-clinical remission. The rate of patients who stayed spasm-free in the monotherapy group and the combination therapy group at day 49 or 56 was not significantly different (71.8 vs. 65.8%, p = 0.569), so was at day 120 (61.5 vs. 50.0%, p = 0.308).",d617b78c-61f0-4d0d-a005-3bcc89f5b4d0
31,results26," There was no significant difference in the rate of patients occurring AEs between the two treatment groups.  Network Meta-Analysis  To gain a comprehensive understanding of the efficacy of all included treatments compared to usual- or high-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), a network meta-analysis was conducted using MetaXL (version 5.3) (Figure 7A). Because adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) usage was rather heterogeneous, we defined less than 25 U/day of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) as low-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), otherwise as usual- or high-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). The assignment of treatment groups of all studies and all comparisons of network meta-analysis are provided in Supplementary Material 2.

32,results27,"  Network meta-analysis (Figure 7B) showed that usual- or high-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) did not superior to oral corticosteroids (regardless of the dosage of oral corticosteroids), methylprednisolone pulses (MEP), zonisamide, and KD in the effectiveness of the electro-clinical response. Additional treatments to hormonal therapy, such as topiramate (TPM), pyridoxine, and MgSO4, did not lend any benefits to patients in controlling spasms, but the combination of hormonal therapy and vigabatrin (VGB) was better than using adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) alone (RR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.03–1.43). For general patients without tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) had an edge over vigabatrin (VGB) (RR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.45–0.94).

33,discussion0," The limitations of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) treatment for ISs, such as high costs, availability in resource-limited countries, and severe AEs, make good alternatives of oral corticosteroids. Especially, there is currently no potent evidence showing adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is superior to oral corticosteroids regarding spasm cessation and epileptic spasms neurodevelopmental regression and hypsarrhythmia on the electroencephalogram (EEG) remission of hypsarrhythmia. Our meta-analysis showed that oral corticosteroids, prednisone, and prednisolone, regardless of low (2 mg/kg/day) or high dosage (40–60 mg/day or 4 mg/kg/day), were as effective as adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) in controlling spasms. However, considering that infants have the inadequate ability of the HSD11B1 enzyme to reduce prednisone to prednisolone, the use of low-dose prednisone probably should not be recommended (27).",97b72f64-9b36-4a60-aad7-ba1dd254aa51
34,discussion1," Although oral corticosteroids have overcome many of the limitations associated with adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) treatment, their overall long-period treatment (usually 4–6 weeks) is still a drawback. methylprednisolone pulses (MEP), as another application form of corticosteroids, overcomes the drawback of long-period treatment and, thus, improves treatment compliance. No head-to-head RCT that compared adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and methylprednisolone pulses (MEP) was retrieved during literature searching, but through network meta-analysis, we found that methylprednisolone pulses (MEP) had similar efficacy as adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) in the short-term spasm control (RR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.35–2.11). However, the included RCT (17) and a non-RCT (28) both reported a higher rate of reoccurrence of spasms in patients who received methylprednisolone pulses (MEP), which should not be overlooked.",61bab873-8b73-4a0b-95d8-d158c11b11b2
35,discussion2,"  The commonly reported serious AEs of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) treatment include hypertension, infection, reversible brain shrinkage, cardiac hypertrophy, and electrolyte abnormalities, which deter the extensive usage of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). These AEs may be dose- and duration-dependent, so it is of great concern to strike the balance among the lower adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) dose, fewer AEs, and maximum therapeutic effects. Our analysis showed the effectiveness of low- and usual-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) was not different, but patients using usual-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) were at higher risk of having AEs. Overall, low-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) should be considered over high-dose regimens due to comparative effectiveness and a preferable profile of AEs.",a52257fe-2287-4c09-9f7c-b226a7b6a44c
36,discussion3,"  The vigabatrin (VGB), as an inhibitor of GABA-transaminase, has been introduced as a first-choice drug in the treatment of ISs, especially it is the best choice for IS caused by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (29, 30). vigabatrin (VGB) is given orally and rapidly absorbed, which is a great advantage for pediatric patients. Although visual-field defect, which is usually irreversible and asymptomatic, has been reported in pediatric patients, vigabatrin (VGB), in general, is well-tolerated in children (31). It is of utmost importance to address whether vigabatrin (VGB) has similar therapeutic effectiveness as hormonal therapy in patients with IS who do not have tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Our analysis showed that hormonal therapy had better efficacy in spasm cessation for general patients with ISs; compared to vigabatrin (VGB), even a few patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) were occasionally included.",40a92f4a-0e1f-4cec-867d-7021a66f9a3e
37,discussion4," In addition, the only regimen in our analysis that had better efficacy than adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) was the combined use of hormonal therapy and vigabatrin (VGB).  Even if hormonal therapy and vigabatrin (VGB) are administered at the first-line treatments, only about 30% of patients achieve long-term remission. Many patients have the reoccurrence of spasms or develop other types of epilepsy, such as Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. There is a strong demand for other compelling therapeutic options. A systematic review showed that at least 25% of patients, most of which failed the first-line treatments, can be expected to have a >50% reduction of spasm frequency after the treatment of zonisamide (32). A systematic review of 13 observational studies showed that 57.4% of patients achieved >50% improvement in spasm frequency with 6 months of KD treatment (33). A recent non-RCT on patients who failed hormonal therapy showed that 13.",d22c5c09-0a50-4dc6-ae77-f8e59679586c
38,discussion5,"4% of patients had ≥50% spasm reduction compared to 10% in the control group (34). When addressing the effectiveness and safety of other non-first-line treatment for ISs, out of consideration of ethics, most studies used observational or uncontrolled trials, and inevitably, the included patients often have complicated medication histories of AEDs or long treatment lag. During our literature search, only two RCTs administered alternative treatments (i.e., KD and zonisamide) as the first-line treatments to patients with hormonal therapy naïve. Our network meta-analysis revealed that neither of these two treatments showed a difference in the effectiveness of short-term spasm control compared to usual-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). Additionally, the combining use of hormonal therapy with topiramate (TPM), pyridoxine, or MgSO4 did not lend any benefits to patients in spasm control, either.",3ae1a263-6b6b-410e-bf83-67f66ce01798
39,discussion6,"  The main limitation of this study is the high heterogeneity of included patients and treatment protocols. The age range, sex ratio, and the ratio of cryptogenic and symptomatic ISs varied from study to study. A variety of agents were used, such as natural adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) gel or synthetic adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), in a rather wide range of treatment lengths and dosages. Although 2 weeks after initiation of treatment was the most common time point to evaluate electro-clinical response, some studies adopted longer time intervals (4–8 weeks) before the evaluation, which was another source of clinical heterogeneity. As shown in Zou et al. (22) and Angappan et al. (21), the proportion of patients with epileptic spasms neurodevelopmental regression and hypsarrhythmia on the electroencephalogram (EEG) remission increased at a later time point.",3ad81ae0-7e93-4d43-a53c-17c0d377f462
40,discussion7," Another limitation is the limited number and small sample size of RCTs that studied other alternative treatments, such as KD or zonisamide, thereby, making the level of evidence low. Furthermore, many of the included studies, even studies that compared hormonal therapy and vigabatrin (VGB), did not exclude the patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which may confound the comparison of effectiveness. Thus, our results must be interpreted with caution.  Conclusion  Our systematic review and meta-analysis showed that oral corticosteroids could be optional alternatives when adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is not applicable due to high costs, limited availability, or severe AEs, but for methylprednisolone pulses (MEP) as the first-line treatment, more studies are needed to explore the treatment duration and dosage and continuous effects on spasm control.",cb386b7f-0a90-44db-af18-791ccb1a6015
41,discussion8," Low-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is recommended because of similar effectiveness and lower risk of AEs compared to high-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). The evaluation of the effectiveness of other alternative treatments still needs RCTs with multicentric involvement and larger sample size to provide a higher level of evidence.
