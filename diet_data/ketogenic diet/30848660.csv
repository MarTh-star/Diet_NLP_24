0,background0,"In China, the treatment procedures for metastatic breast cancer primarily follow the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)) guidelines, which recommend single-drug treatments for recurrent or metastatic disease [1–3]. Such agents typically include anthracyclines, taxanes, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, capecitabine, and eribulin [3]. However, there are no standard international recommendations for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have developed resistance to anthracyclines and taxanes. Thus, it is difficult to select an effective therapeutic regimen for metastatic breast cancer.  A recent phase II study evaluated the use of NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol, a derivative of the topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor irinotecan) among patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer and revealed a satisfactory therapeutic effect based on an objective response rate (objective response rate (ORR)) of 29% [4]. Perez et al.",a5d19ba6-27cc-4aac-aa30-b509b1786560
1,background1," [5] revealed that irinotecan monotherapy (once weekly or every 3 weeks) was safe and effective for patients with breast cancer who developed resistance to anthracyclines and/or taxanes; furthermore, weekly intravenously administered irinotecan administered for four continuous weeks followed by a 2-week rest was more beneficial than intravenously administered irinotecan once every 3 weeks, with slightly fewer adverse events (AEs). Shigeoka et al. [6] retrospectively determined that irinotecan monotherapy (100 mg/m2 weekly) was not as effective as salvage chemotherapy in 20 patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer who were previously treated with doxorubicin or docetaxel. Therefore, further large-sample data are warranted to determine the therapeutic efficacy of irinotecan for advanced breast cancer.",cc4539b1-ed7f-425e-99d4-956eefb8e57f
2,background2," These data also indicate that irinotecan monotherapy may be available for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have previously been treated with anthracyclines and/or taxanes.  In recent years, studies have evaluated the role of a ketogenic diet as an adjuvant therapy in enhancing the disease’s sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cancer patients. However, little has been reported on ketogenic diets as an adjuvant therapy for metastatic breast cancer [7]. The combination of a ketogenic diet and high-dose vitamin D3 can decrease Her-2 expression and increase progesterone-receptor expression in breast cancer patients [8]. When ketone bodies function as the main energy source in patients, normal cells in the human body can obtain enough energy to survive; conversely, the growth and metabolism of tumor cells, which are unable to obtain energy from ketone bodies, are inhibited.",3a306ece-443a-4130-8a94-344733c9caf5
3,background3," Although there are limited clinical studies on ketogenic diets for tumor treatment, some animal experiments and case reports have confirmed the effectiveness of a ketogenic diet in the treatment of breast cancer [7–10], which suggests that a ketogenic diet may be a potential strategy for tumor metabolic regulation [11, 12]. Therefore, we hypothesize that the ketogenic diet may be beneficial for breast cancer treatment.  A literature search showed that some clinical protocols targeting a ketogenic diet as an adjuvant treatment for breast cancer have been reported in recent years, such as a ketogenic diet combined with letrozole for treating estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer (NCT03962647), a ketogenic diet combined with paclitaxel for stage IV breast cancer (NCT03535701), and a ketogenic diet combined with a low-glycemic and insulinemic diet for the rehabilitation of breast cancer patients (Table 1).",b0325f73-a57d-46ea-a515-c5b19958e895
4,background4," However, no prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or articles have assessed irinotecan combined with a ketogenic diet for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Therefore, this randomized controlled clinical trial was designed to observe whether irinotecan combined with a ketogenic diet can promote sensitivity to chemotherapy and remit target lesions in locally recurrent or metastatic Her-2-negative breast cancer patients.

For a diet-stable patient, the detection of ketone bodies can be gradually reduced to once or twice a week.
