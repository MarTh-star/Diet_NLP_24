0,methods0,"2.1 Study Design The current study used banked sera samples from men previously enrolled on a prospective randomized phase II trial of an extreme low‐carbohydrate diet (low‐carbohydrate diet (LCD)) plus walking intervention for men initiating Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) vs control (asked to make no changes in diet or exercise). The primary results of the study have previously been reported. 19  In this manuscript, we report the effects of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on the serum metabolomics in men randomized to the control arm. The results from the intervention arm will be reported in a future manuscript.  2.2 Study participants In brief, after obtaining IRB approval at each site (Duke University, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center [VAMC], and Greater Los Angeles VAMC), men initiating Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were approached and if they agreed, they signed a written consent that included future analyses.",9bf5c3ae-03ba-4559-bda8-4c6e53ea5840
1,methods1," Clinical data and fasting serum samples were collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months post randomization.  Key eligibility included men about to begin hormonal therapy (LHRH agonist, LHRH‐antagonist, or orchiectomy) for PC with an anticipated duration of ≥ 6 months, BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2, and phone access to speak with the dietitian. Key exclusion criteria included medication‐controlled diabetes, taking any medications that may interfere with insulin, already consuming a low‐carbohydrate diet (LCD), being vegetarian/vegan, or baseline screening HbA1c > 7%. A total of 42 eligible participants enrolled and were randomized. A total of 40 participants completed the baseline visit (N = 19 low‐carbohydrate diet (LCD), N = 21 control). In the control arm, 20 participants completed the 6‐month visit and the results of the metabolomics profiling from their blood specimen were included in this report.  2.",4b5e7bd8-267c-4697-ae71-2c9fff9a6a24
2,methods2,"3 Data collection and analysis At each visit of the subject in the study, weight (without shoes and in light clothing) and height were measured, fasting blood collected, and study‐related adverse events were assessed. Fasting blood was analyzed for insulin, glucose, prostate specific antigen (prostate specific antigen (PSA)), lipids, and high sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hsCRP). prostate specific antigen (PSA), glucose, and lipids were measured by commercial laboratories (LabCorp and Greater LA VAMC clinical lab). Insulin was measured in an electro‐chemiluminescent immunoassay using an SI‐2400 imager and assay kits from Meso Scale Discovery (Rockville, MD) by Duke Immunoassay Laboratory. The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)‐IR was calculated using the approximation (glucose*insulin)/22.5.",6f2c15ff-b797-42a7-999c-d524073570a5
3,methods3,"  Fasting blood samples collected at baseline (BL), 3 months (M3), and 6 months (M6) were used for the metabolomics analysis utilizing GC/MS‐TOF (Gas chromatography–Mass Spectrometry Time of Flight analyzer), QqQ LC (Liquid Chromatography)‐HILIC (Hydrophilic interaction chromatography)‐MS/MS, and TripleTOF LC‐RP‐MS as described previously. 20  Lipidomics analysis using SCIEX 5600 + MS/MS workflows were utilized to quantify the chemical diversity of the metabolome and lipidome. 20 ,  21 ,  22    2.4 Statistical analysis Volcano plot was used to visually examine the changes in metabolites at 3 and 6 months from baseline. Significant changes were examined by ANOVA and shown in heatmaps and box plots. Impacted metabolic pathways were selected and mapped using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/). 23  Pearson correlation was conducted to examine associations between the clinical variables and metabolites.  3 ",b64c64c4-af56-4ead-8e9e-03dcb83d1891
4,results0,"Over 450 metabolites and 104 signaling lipid species were measured in serum of subjects before and after Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (Figure 1), and key findings are summarized below.  Figure 1 The overview of the sample cohort, the multi‐omics assessment of the serum metabolites and statistical evaluation of the Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐induced metabolomic changes. A total of 42 patients with PC were randomized to either Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone or Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with low‐carbohydrate diet (low‐carbohydrate diet (LCD)) and walking advice intervention for 6 months. Here, we only present the changes of serum metabolomes of 20 in the control arm (20 men) who have completed the 3 and 6 month visits. Fasting serum samples were collected from 20 at baseline (BL), then 3 and 6 months after the initiation of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).",85a019e8-989f-429a-8cca-018fd4752b3c
5,results1," The serum samples were then subject to the multi‐omic assessment to determine the metabolomic changes, followed by the statistical assessment to identify the Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐affected metabolites and metabolic pathways  3.1 Serum metabolites altered after 3 months of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (M3 metabolites) To identify the Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐induced metabolomic changes, we first used the univariate statistics to detect differences and volcano plots to visualize the different levels of selected metabolites between baseline (BL, before Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)) and after 3 months (M3) of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐affected metabolites were identified based on the thresholds of 1.2‐fold change and t tests P < .1. The top Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐affected metabolites were shown in Volcano plots along with the metabolites that were significantly changed in a table (Figure 2).",fa9e96ab-31f3-41de-8354-2034c95c88d6
6,results2," At 3 months, the top Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐affected metabolites include the reduction of many long‐chain acyl‐carnitines, including hydroxymyristoyl‐carnitine, malonyl‐carnitine, hexanoyl‐carnitine and dodecenoyl‐carnitine, octanoyl‐carnitine and oleoyl‐carnitine, and decanoyl‐carnitines. In addition, Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly reduced the levels of androsterone sulfate, 3‐hydroxyburtirc acid, and indoleacetic acid (indoleacetic acid (IAA)), a trypan‐derived metabolite from microbiomes. 23  In addition, 3 months of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (M3) also increased the level of dihydroxycholestanoyl taurine, dodecanedioic acid, and eicosatetraenoic acid.

In addition, there was also a reduction in several long‐chain acylcarnitines, including malonylcarnitine, oleoylcarnitine, hexanoylcarnitine, tetradecendoycarnitine, heptanoylcarnitine palmitoylcarnitine, decanoyl‐carnitines, and myristolylcarntine. Consistent with the changes at 3 months, Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) at 6 months significantly reduced the levels of androsterone sulfate and 3‐hydroxyburtirc acid.",139a30aa-7ef2-4c0e-b83e-06408e05a030
8,results4," In addition, 6 months of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (M6) also reduced the plasma level of organic acids, including oxalic acid, glycolic acid, and nonanoic acid.

The indicated metabolites have been selected by Volcano analysis of pairwise comparison between the baseline and 6 months Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) treatments. Fold change (FC) for selected metabolites listed in the embedded table  3.3 Lipidomic analysis In addition, we also performed the structural lipid analysis which quantified over 1000 lipid molecular species from over 18 lipid classes. Comparison of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐treated vs non‐treated PC patients revealed 26 lipid molecular species at 3 months (Figure S1A) and 24 lipid molecular species at 6 months (Figure S1B) that were statistically significant between the two groups (Tables S1 and S2).",9b9cbb1d-05a6-4e49-851e-7d86cf612fc9
9,results5," Further analysis via ANOVA revealed no significant lipids between the Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) treatment group and nontreatment group (Figure S1C), suggesting that Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) does not impact the serum lipidome in PC patients compared to the effect determined in the metabolome.  3.4 Metabolites consistently altered in both M3 and M6 In order to identify consistently affected metabolites we applied ANOVA––Simultaneous Component Analysis (ASCA module, MetaboAnlyst 4.0) allowing us to identify the major patterns associated with the time points and phenotype. Several metabolites consistently affected by Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were in the fatty acid metabolism (Figure 4A).",f3490e1d-c325-46b2-beaf-2647ab4796d1
10,results6," Especially noted is the consistent reduction in the 3‐hydroxybutyric acid (Figure 4B) as well as multiple metabolites in the fatty acid metabolisms (Figure 4C), including a decrease in several long‐chain acyl‐carnitines (malonylcarnitine, heptanoylcarnitine, palmitoylcarnitine, pelargonic acid, and hexanoylcarnitine). However, there was no change in the free carnitine (Figure 4C). These changes consistently reflect the potential impact of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on ketogenesis and fatty acids metabolism as shown in Figure 4A.

The statistical significance (P values) of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐induced changes of indicated metabolites is indicated  3.5 Pathway analysis of the affected metabolites Since the above findings indicate several Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐altered metabolites belong to similar metabolic pathways, we used MetaboAnalyst 4.0 24  to identify the metabolic pathways in which multiple metabolites were significantly impacted by Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).",e6927712-3647-4169-b92a-4b27086ae5fe
12,results8," Instead of evaluating individual metabolite for the significance of their changes in response to Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA)) 25  directly evaluated a set of functionally related metabolites for their functional enrichment. Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) is based on a library of 1000 predefined metabolite sets covering various metabolic pathways, enabling the identification of obvious as well as “subtle but coordinated” changes among a group of related metabolites that may go undetected with conventional approaches. Therefore, similar to gene set enrichment analysis (gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)), 26  Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) has the potential to identify subtle but consistent changes among a group of related compounds in the same metabolic pathways, which may go undetected with the conventional approaches.",4484af38-1ea3-449c-afc5-db3f6371b22b
13,results9," The top enriched pathways identified by Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) in this study include steroid biosynthesis, phenylacetate metabolism, thiamine metabolism and pentose phosphate, mitochondria β‐oxidation, inositol phosphate metabolisms, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, and fatty acid metabolism (Figure 5). While some of these pathways were uncovered by the analysis of individual metabolites (steroid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism), Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) also uncovered several metabolic pathways (thiamine metabolism and pentose phosphate, mitochondria β‐oxidation, inositol phosphate metabolisms, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis 27 ).

14,results10,"6 Correlation of blood chemistry with the Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐induced changes in androsterone sulfate Given the top pathway of steroid biosynthesis is the intended targets of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the reduced androsterone sulfate may serve as the direct on‐target metabolic endpoint to indicate the success of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to reduce the serum androgens. Therefore, we calculated the Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐induced changes in androsterone sulfate for each subject and then correlated the changes with various clinical laboratory parameters affected by Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (Figure 6). We found that the degree of the androsterone sulfate was highly correlated with the changes in glucose at both 3 (P < .001) and 6 months (P = .002). The stronger repression of the Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐induced androsterone sulfate, the greater the elevation of the serum glucose in a dose‐response manner.",31d2c3a3-fcdf-4512-a200-a40260835cfb
15,results11," In contrast, the changes in androsterone sulfate were not significantly correlated with the changes in insulin, LDL or total cholesterol. But this lack of correlation may be due to the small cohort size (20 individuals) in this study. While statistically insignificantly, the relationship between the androsterone sulfate and insulin was negative at M3 (Figure 6A), and then shifted to positive at M6 (Figure 6B). Neither correlation reached statistical significance. However, one possible explanation for the changes is the loss of muscle mass which is closely associated with insulin sensitivity. There seemed to be a tendency for the greater repression in Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to be correlated with a greater rise in insulin at 3 months but this tendency disappeared at 6 months. In addition, at 6 months, the greater the repression in Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) seemed to be correlated with a tendency of lower LDL (P = .080) and total cholesterol (P = .",ed60e2e3-969e-45bc-a334-e8f9873702fc

17,results13," The correlation coefficient of the metabolites with androsterone sulfate were arranged by hierarchical clustering in a heatmap (Figure 7A, red: positive correlation, green: negative correlation with changes in androsterone sulfate). This analysis identified the clusters of metabolites whose changes were highly correlated with the changes in androsterone sulfate, either congruent (change in the same direction, red) or opposite (changes in the opposite direction, green). Among the congruent metabolites, we noted unsurprisingly several related male hormones, including testosterone sulfate, DHEA sulfate, and pregnanolone sulfate that were highly correlated with Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐induced changes in androsterone sulfate (Figure 7B).",ecb64a59-a88c-480f-bd6a-b949bb8116a9

Changes in androsterone sulfate were also significantly correlated with two metabolites of the ketogenesis pathway, 1 methyl‐3‐ketovaleric acid and 2‐hydroxy‐2‐methylbutyric acid (Figure 7D) after 3 months of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (both P < .001).

20,discussion0," In this study, we applied MS‐based metabolomic profiling to determine the effects of 3 and 6 months of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on the serum metabolome. The key metabolic changes observed as a result of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) can be summarized into at least four areas: (a) steroid metabolism, (b) ketogenesis, (c) fatty acid metabolism, and (d) microbiome metabolism. These changes were observed while the participants maintained similar dietary intake and exercise pattern from baseline to end of the 6 months study. 19  As previously published, the control participants increased the median intake of carbohydrate and fat by about 10 grams/day and decreased protein and calories by about 6 grams/day and 95 kcal/day, respectively. In addition, these participants remained at similar exercise level from baseline to 6 months as reflected by the increase of 1 unit in MET score.",f23421e1-8af9-41df-b270-ace6e798b942
21,discussion1," Some of our findings are consistent with a previous study of 3 month Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) 18  and additionally shows that the impact extends to 6 months of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) treatment. In addition, our cohorts include 6 month and we applied some distinct analytic approaches and identified several new metabolomic responses and correlated these changes with blood chemistry and the changes of all metabolites to identify the changes which are correlated with the degrees of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐induced changes in androgen sulfate. However, it is important to point out that this is a small cohort of 20 individuals. Therefore, there are significant limitations in the findings from such a small cohort and any findings need to be validated in much larger studies in the future.",0ed9c05d-e932-4075-b39a-fbfa2e008aa8
22,discussion2," Furthermore, it will be clinically relevant to determine whether different forms of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (eg, GnRH agonist, antagonist, or surgery) would have different metabolic signatures. However, we would surmise that the dominant effect seen would be related to castration, regardless of how this was achieved. Unfortunately, these data were not captured in the trial. That being said, in clinical practice orchiectomy and GnRH antagonists are rarely used and thus it is likely nearly all or all the men in this study were GnRH agonist patients. Regardless, it will be important to consider identifying any treatment‐specific metabolic effects in the future studies.  The side effect of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been shown previously to include metabolic disturbances such as impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, which increase the risk for diabetes and CV death. 3  Our data also support such an effect.",c46b68c7-92e5-4b8c-81bb-641c205ee35d
23,discussion3," We found that the Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐induced reduction in androgen sulfate is associated with an elevation in serum glucose and a greater rise in insulin at 3 months. At 6 months, the greater the Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐induced repression of androgen sulfate tends to be associated with a lower LDL (P = .080) and total cholesterol (P = .074). The significant correlation between the reduction in androsterone sulfate and rise in fasting glucose is consistent with the clinical evidence that Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) leads to increase risk of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear why the insulin level did not respond in tandem with glucose at both time points.  As expected from Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), there was a significant reduction in the steroid biosynthesis as shown in the reduced androsterone sulfate, DHEA sulfate, and pregnanolone sulfate.",b0b2ad0c-34a4-473e-b76c-1f0f632a053f
24,discussion4," This finding also objectively verifies the intended impact of the therapy to reduce various steroid species. In addition, we observed that 3‐hydroxybutyric acid was reduced at both 3 and 6 months. 3‐hydroxybutyric acid is a ketone body synthesized in the liver from acetyl‐CoA and can be used as an alternative energy source when blood glucose is low. This reduction of ketone body may be due to the increased blood glucose in response to Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) at both time points. The reduction of the 3‐hydroxybutyric acid indicates that Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) either reduced acetyl‐CoA/ketogenesis or increased the consumption of ketone bodies. Ketone pathway is found to be regulated by many oncogenic pathways. 28 ,  29  Previous quantitative proteomics reveals that multiple ketogenic enzymes and increase in β‐hydroxybutyrate are associated with PC progression.",ca6c1434-cb4f-4afd-886f-ac402af7f423
25,discussion5," 30  Ketone body is also postulated to trigger insulin resistance and the ability of ketogenic diets to mitigate insulin resistance may be associated with the ability of ketone bodies to overcome insulin resistance. 31  Therefore, the Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐associated reduced ketone body may contribute to the insulin resistance seen in these patients. Although speculative at this point, we are curious about the potential of ketogenic diets to prevent Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐induced insulin resistance, similar to our previous study of low carbohydrate diets. 19    In addition to the impact on ketogenesis, there is a consistent reduction in various acyl‐carnitine and fatty acids metabolites including palmitoleic acid, octanoylcarnitine, palmitoylcarnitine indicating that Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly reduced fatty acid β‐oxidation. Importantly, there was no change in the free carnitine.",a0c59345-8710-47f3-9537-f08017131206
26,discussion6," This finding is again similar to the previous study by Saylor et al 18  but additionally demonstrates that the impact remains till 6 months of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Acyl‐carnitines are generated by carnitine acyltransferases from combining carnitine and acyl‐CoAs as metabolic intermediates of fatty acid metabolism. The accumulation of acyl‐carnitines usually occurs when there is imbalance between β‐oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid (tricarboxylic acid (TCA)) cycle. In some studies, the accumulated acyl‐carnitines in plasma are a transport form of various acyl‐groups between tissues and utilized for energy production in various tissues. High levels of acyl‐carnitines are also associated with diet‐induced obesity and insulin resistance in both animal models and human. 32 ,  33  Insulin infusion directly reduced the level of long‐chain acyl‐carnitines in plasma.",11935247-d9fd-479a-9cf3-240d2957b40d
27,discussion7," Therefore, elevated acylcarnitine have been postulated to contribute to insulin resistance phenotypes 34  of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In our study, we found that while increasing serum glucose, Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) consistently reduced the level of long‐chain acyl‐carnitines without affecting free carnitines. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) impacted beta‐oxidation and resulted in the changes of acyl‐carnitines and ketone bodies in circulation. Such lower levels of acyl‐carnitines associated with insulin resistance was also noted among HIV+ individuals. 35  Our results may suggest that long‐chain acyl‐carnitines may not be responsible for insulin resistance during Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) treatment and/or Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐insulin resistance occurs through distinct mechanisms which do not involve the elevated long‐chain acyl‐carnitines.",7eb78db3-f22a-4dac-a735-ca77aef228a7
28,discussion8," Since acyl‐carnitines was found to be higher in PC, 36  the reduced serum long‐chain acylcarnitine may reflect the therapeutic effects of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for PC and may serve as potential biomarkers for Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) response.  During oncogenesis, tumors with particular oncogenic mutations are found to develop addictions to particular sets of amino acids. 37 ,  38 ,  39  Furthermore, the nutrient and metabolic status may also help to shape the genetic landscape of tumors. 40 ,  41 ,  42  During the past decade, one of the consistent and reliable metabolic biomarkers for insulin resistance is the elevated branched‐chain amino acids (BCAAs). 43  BCAA metabolic signature is also postulated to be an important contributor to the insulin resistance and targeting BCAA may have therapeutic potential. 44  While Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is known to be associated with insulin resistance, we did not notice an elevated BCAA metabolic signature.",6a3fd57f-ecbb-4921-af23-d1123e230200
29,discussion9," Similar lack of BCAA signature was also noted in the insulin resistance in HIV+ patients. 35  The lack of BCAA metabolic signature may suggest that Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐induced insulin resistance may occur through a distinct metabolism, such as the reduced ketone bodies and insulin response. Our future analyses of men on the low‐carbohydrate diet (LCD) may allow us to test this hypothesis.  Unexpectedly, we found that Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) reduces the level of Indole Acetic Acid (indoleacetic acid (IAA)), a breakdown product of tryptophan metabolism that is often produced by the action of bacteria in the mammalian gut. indoleacetic acid (IAA) is an agonist for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in intestinal immune cells to stimulate the production of IL‐22 which facilitates the regulation of mucosal reactivity and inflammation. 23  It is interesting to note that there are significant sex‐specific features of the microbiome that is partially driven by sex hormone.",b3202f2a-a39d-4863-bda7-77ab0a5f687e
30,discussion10," 45 ,  46  Studies in murine models demonstrate that castration and antiandrogens can affect the composition of gut microbiota. 47 ,  48  Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is also associated with changes in the microbiomes. 49 ,  50 ,  51  Furthermore, IL‐22 has been recently associated with the development of Polycystic ovary syndrome (Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)), 52  a disease characterized by androgen excess, accompanied by insulin resistance. 53  Therefore, our observation may suggest a novel role of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)‐induced microbiome, indoleacetic acid (IAA) and IL‐22 to exert metabolic influences on inflammation, which may contribute to the metabolic effects of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In the future, simultaneous profiling of the microbiome and gut metabolisms during Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may help to elucidate the role of microbiome in the treatment efficacy and side effects of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).",cc6c4bc9-4cfe-406b-abb3-d59d2fdf325c
