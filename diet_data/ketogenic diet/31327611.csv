4,results0,"Decanoic Acid Reduces mTORC1 Signaling in Dictyostelium. As wide-ranging therapeutic benefits of the classical ketogenic diet have been associated with inhibition of mTORC1 signaling (1, 4, 8, 9) (Fig. 1A), we employed Dictyostelium to investigate the effects of the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet constituents decanoic acid and octanoic acid on this activity. We initially assessed the effects of these medium-chain fatty acids on Dictyostelium unicellular growth and multicellular development to establish relevant concentrations of decanoic acid and octanoic acid to investigate in this model. Dictyostelium cell growth was quantified in the presence of a range of concentrations of both fatty acids, with cell counts being recorded once every 24 h from 3 to 7 d posttreatment (Fig. 1 B and C). Treatment with both fatty acids caused a dose-dependent inhibition of growth.",71aad387-4d00-4061-b39b-892a120794b1
5,results1," The rate of the exponential growth phase was then used to plot nonlinear regression curves, and half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) were calculated. Decanoic acid provided an IC50 of 18 µM (Fig. 1 B and D), while octanoic acid was less potent with an IC50 of 86 µM (Fig. 1 C and D). Since Dictyostelium also show a multicellular development cycle, we also investigated these fatty acids in regulating this process, where starving cells form fruiting bodies comprising dead vacuolated stalks holding spore heads aloft under control condition cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). This developmental process was unaffected by decanoic acid and octanoic acid at concentrations of fatty acids (200 µM) far greater than that shown to inhibit cell growth, suggesting that these compounds regulate molecular targets required for cell proliferation but not development (Fig. 1 B–D and SI Appendix, Fig. S1).",789c085c-8033-4f51-bd40-df928f4c8f45

Glucose activates mTORC1 through inhibition of activated protein kinase (AMPK). Conversely, the ketogenic diet inhibits mTORC1 through inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTORC1 induces 4E-BP1 to dissociate from eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), promoting the initiation of translation, and this phosphorylation is used in this study as a readout for mTORC1 activation.

8,results4," Significance is indicated by ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001.  In order to monitor the effects of decanoic acid and octanoic acid on mTORC1 signaling in Dictyostelium, we quantified levels of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (p-4E-BP1), a translation repressor directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 (Fig. 1A) (38, 39). Concentrations of decanoic acid and octanoic acid corresponding to an ∼95% reduction in growth rate (60 and 120 µM, respectively) (Fig. 1D) were employed, providing concentrations relevant to those observed in plasma of patients on the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet (decanoic acid, 157 µM; octanoic acid, 310 µM) (24, 40). Dictyostelium cells were treated with fatty acids for 1 or 24 h before p-4E-BP1 levels were quantified by Western blot (Fig. 1 E and F). Decanoic acid decreased p-4E-BP1 levels at 1 and 24 h (Fig. 1E), while treatment with octanoic acid had no significant effect on the levels of p-4E-BP1 at either treatment duration (Fig. 1F).",7329139b-d853-4001-8a02-4b183d8223dd
9,results5," Starvation, a physiological process well-established to reduce mTORC1 activity (41, 42), also caused a significant decrease in p-4E-BP1 levels in Dictyostelium (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A), as did two established mTOR inhibitors (38, 43) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 B and C). Rapamycin did not significantly alter p-4E-BP1 levels under our conditions (SI Appendix, Fig. S2D), consistent with findings showing a lack of autophagic response to rapamycin in Dictyostelium (44).  Since mTORC1 is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling and inhibited by AMP-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) signaling (Fig. 1A), we also investigated a role for decanoic acid in these signaling pathways. We monitored the effects of decanoic acid on PI3K/AKT signaling by measuring levels of a phosphorylated AKT substrate (p-AKT-S) (45, 46) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 E and F).",90a6035d-cdc2-4fc8-86c3-7427f247f7af
10,results6," No significant difference was observed in p-AKT-S levels after treatment with decanoic acid (60 µM) for 1 or 24 h (Fig. 1G). This indicated that decanoic acid targets mTORC1 independent of PI3K/AKT signaling under these conditions, and further suggests that decanoic acid inhibits mTORC1 without altering mTORC2 activation. In these growing cells, it was not possible to assay PI3K signaling through monitoring phosphorylation of the activation loops of the AKT homologs PKBR1 (T309) and PKBA (T278), since this signaling is undetectable during growth (45, 47) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2G). We also evaluated the effect of decanoic acid on activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling by assessing phospho-activated protein kinase (AMPK)α (p-activated protein kinase (AMPK)) levels (39, 48) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 H–K), where no significant difference was observed (Fig. 1H).

11,results7," We sought to identify potential molecular targets for decanoic acid by isolating decanoic acid-resistant mutants using an unbiased genetic screen of a library of Dictyostelium insertional mutants (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). The library of mutants was screened with a concentration of decanoic acid that inhibits wild-type cell growth (120 µM; 7 d). Using this approach, mutants resistant to decanoic acid were isolated, and the location of the insertion site within the genome of these mutants was determined to identify genes controlling decanoic acid sensitivity. From this, a decanoic acid-resistant mutant, UBXD18−, was identified (Fig. 2B), with the mutagenic insertion in the region coding for the ubiquitin-associated domain of the ubxd18 gene (DDB_G0276057).  Fig. 2.

12,results8," (A) A genetic screen of an insertional mutant library was carried out to identify mutants partially resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of medium-chain fatty acids. (B) The genetic screen identified a gene encoding UBX domain-containing protein 18 (DDB_G0276057) as being a potential target for decanoic acid. The two most highly conserved human proteins, UBXN1 and UBXD2, are shown alongside a schematic of the Dictyostelium UBXD18 protein. These proteins share a common UBX domain with a highly conserved s3/s4 loop involved in binding p97 (highlighted).  Proteomic analysis enabled the initial characterization of the Dictyostelium UBXD18 protein. The UBXD18 protein sequence shared homology with two human UBX domain-containing proteins (UBXN1, UniProt Q04323; UBXD2, UniProt Q92575) (Fig. 2B), with highly conserved UBX domains (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B).",95dad37c-6082-4c2a-b402-cc30e3f732cc
13,results9," The Dictyostelium UBX domain shared 28% identical and 51% similar amino acids with the UBX domain of UBXN1, and 27% identical and 51% similar amino acids with the UBX domain of UBXD2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). A binding loop (s3/s4) known to interact with the AAA ATPase p97 was partially conserved between these proteins (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B) (49), suggesting that these proteins are p97-binding partners. Cladistic analysis of all Dictyostelium and human UBX proteins (SI Appendix, Fig. S3C) confirmed that the UBXN1 and UBXD2 proteins are the most likely homologs of the Dictyostelium UBXD18 protein.  The Effects of Decanoic Acid on Dictyostelium Growth and mTORC1 Signaling Are Dependent on UBXD18. We next generated an independent UBXD18− mutant to confirm that the UBXD18 protein regulates sensitivity to decanoic acid (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Fig. S4A).",554740eb-9d32-4550-9fd4-60f490fafb45
14,results10," This recapitulated mutant was produced by insertion of a 1,592-bp blasticidin resistance sequence into the central region of the ubxd18 gene, and was confirmed by loss of gene expression (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A and C). UBXD18 activity was also reintroduced to UBXD18− by expression of ubxd18 complementary DNA (cDNA) in the mutant (SI Appendix, Fig. S4B), where the presence of green fluorescent protein (green fluorescent protein (GFP))-UBXD18 was confirmed by Western blot analysis (SI Appendix, Fig. S4D). Wild-type, knockout (UBXD18−), and rescue (UBXD18−/+) cells were then assessed for the effect of decanoic acid on growth to quantify resistance (Fig. 3B), with IC50 values indicating comparative sensitivity (Fig. 3C). This analysis demonstrated that UBXD18− was partially resistant to the effect of decanoic acid, with an IC50 value twofold higher than that of the parental cell line (UBXD18− IC50 37 µM, compared with wild-type IC50 18 µM) (Fig. 3C).",dc98a8f8-cc11-41d8-96ca-21f6a66b8f14

Here, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was monitored in wild-type, UBXD18−, and UBXD18−/+ in the presence of decanoic acid. Loss of UBXD18 caused a decrease in p-4E-BP1 levels compared with wild type, and p-4E-BP1 levels were restored by reintroduction of the protein (UBXD18−/+) (Fig. 3D). Analyzing p-4E-BP1 levels following decanoic acid treatment (60 µM for 1 or 24 h) showed that UBXD18− was unresponsive to treatment (Fig. 3E), and UBXD18−/+ showed restored decanoic acid sensitivity following 24-h treatment (Fig. 3F).  Characterization of UBXD18 as a Binding Partner for Ddp97. Our results demonstrate that UBXD18 controls sensitivity to decanoic acid in both growth and mTORC1 regulation in Dictyostelium.

(Scale bar, 10 µm.)  Investigating the Effect of Decanoic Acid on Ddp97 Activity. An interaction between UBXD18 and Ddp97 suggests a role for UBXD18 in regulating Ddp97 function, and thus implicates Ddp97 in the cellular changes caused by decanoic acid in Dictyostelium. To analyze this, we assessed the effect of decanoic acid on Ddp97 activity by treating wild-type cells expressing Ddp97-RFP with decanoic acid, octanoic acid, or the established selective p97 inhibitor DBeQ (N2,N4-dibenzylquinazoline-2,4-diamine) (16, 52) for 24 h before immunoprecipitation of Ddp97-RFP and direct assessment of ATPase activity (53) (Fig. 5). Treatment with decanoic acid (60 µM) decreased Ddp97-RFP ATPase activity (Fig. 5 A and D), while octanoic acid (120 µM) had no significant effect, and the p97 inhibitor DBeQ (7.",123862d4-4783-4837-be04-c17ada58f4be

Reintroduction of UBXD18 into UBXD18−/+ also restored the decanoic acid-dependent reduction of Ddp97-RFP activity (Fig. 5 C and F).

In these experiments, cells were treated with DBeQ (7.5 and 15 μM for 24 h), and cell lysates were analyzed for 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by Western blot (Fig. 5G).

Decanoic Acid Reduces mTORC1 Activity in Rat Hippocampal Slices. Having identified an effect of decanoic acid in reducing mTORC1 activity independent of altered glucose levels and insulin signaling in Dictyostelium, we sought to translate these findings to a mammalian system. Here, we employed rat hippocampal slice preparations maintained in artificial cerebrospinal fluid, ensuring constant glucose levels in the absence of insulin, treated with decanoic acid (100 and 300 μM for 1 h) prior to assessing mTORC1 activity by Western blot analysis of p-4E-BP1 and total-4E-BP1 levels (Fig. 6). Decanoic acid at 100 μM had no significant effect on p-4E-BP1 levels (Fig. 6 A and B) but significantly decreased p-4E-BP1 levels at 300 μM (Fig. 6 A and B) and neither concentration altered total-4E-BP1 levels (Fig.",8a78f5d8-0a31-40ae-8d0b-63ade8ed3a11

In these assays, levels of p-4E-BP1 were not significantly altered following treatment (SI Appendix, Fig. S9 A and B), but the reduction in the ratio of p-4E-BP1/total-4E-BP1 was caused by a significant increase in levels of total-4E-BP1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S9 C and D). Interestingly, variability was observed between cells from different tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)2 patients, with cells from one patient showing no significant change in total-4E-BP1 levels following decanoic acid treatment, while cells from another patient showed a significant increase (SI Appendix, Fig. S10 A and B).

To confirm the effect of decanoic acid in reducing mTORC1 activity in patient-derived astrocytes, we also analyzed p70 S6 kinase (S6K) phosphorylation levels. For this activity, decreased phosphorylation at threonine 389 (p-S6K) indicated decreased mTORC1 activation (59) (Fig. 7D). Analysis of the same protein extracts showed that decanoic acid treatment also caused a reduction in the ratio of p-S6K/total-S6K in astrocytes derived from control patients and patients with mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 (Fig.",f5692897-1147-4bca-99bc-84e48ee244c9

32,discussion0,"Ketogenic diets are well-established treatments for epilepsies (21) and cancers (6) with exciting potential for use in other areas of health such as treating neurodegenerative disorders (7); however, the therapeutic mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. In this study, we have used Dictyostelium as a tractable model to establish that decanoic acid, one of the major constituents of the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet, inhibits mTORC1 signaling. In order to identify the mechanism behind this effect, we showed that the effects of decanoic acid on mTORC1 are dependent on a UBX domain-containing protein (UBXD18). We demonstrated that decanoic acid inhibits the activity of the ubiquitous binding partner of UBXD18, p97, in a UBXD18-dependent manner, and further showed that direct p97 inhibition is sufficient to reduce mTORC1 signaling in Dictyostelium.",d88f9dfa-4bde-4622-ac1d-f674c1ec4833
33,discussion1," We translated this effect of decanoic acid into a rat hippocampal slice model, demonstrating decanoic acid-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in the absence of glucose deprivation or insulin signaling. Finally, we employed astrocytes derived from patients with mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 or tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)2 associated with dysregulated mTORC1 activity (11, 58) to demonstrate that treatment with decanoic acid results in decreased mTORC1 activation in healthy patients and patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 mutations.  We provide mechanistic insight for the role of decanoic acid in regulating mTORC1 activity in Dictyostelium, through a UBX domain-containing protein and Dictyostelium p97. UBX proteins have previously been shown to directly regulate the activity of p97 in human cells (20).",d1b978dd-fa6d-4afd-8d32-419862db9aad
34,discussion2," By employing a specific inhibitor for p97 (DBeQ), we also confirmed that pharmacological inhibition of Dictyostelium p97 decreased mTORC1 activity and cell proliferation (16) (Fig. 5G and SI Appendix, Fig. S6), suggesting that decanoic acid-induced p97 inhibition could explain the inhibitory effects on mTORC1 activity and growth in the model system (Fig. 5H). Although the role of human p97 in regulating mTORC1 has yet to be established, there is evidence that inhibition of p97 results in the disruption of amino acid homeostasis, potentially leading to the observed reduction in mTORC1 (16, 52). Our data provide an indication that decanoic acid may prevent the interaction of Dictyostelium p97 with its regulatory cofactor UBXD18, thus reducing Dictyostelium p97 activity and leading to a reduction in mTORC1.",8c63e41f-ba55-4435-a8b2-c35a7f081feb
35,discussion3," Interactions between long-chain fatty acids and UBX domain-containing proteins have previously been implicated in blocking p97 activity in mammalian cells (60), suggesting that regulation of p97 via an interaction of decanoic acid with a UBX domain-containing protein represents a viable potential mechanism in humans.  Inhibition of p97 has been proposed as a treatment for cancer and epilepsy (61, 62). In cancers, expression of p97 is increased to manage excessive proteotoxic stress (63), and thus p97 inhibitors are in clinical trials as cancer treatments (64, 65). p97 also plays a role in a common form of epilepsy (autosomal dominant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy), where a mutation in a GABAA receptor subunit (A322D mutation in the α1-subunit) results in misfolding and rapid endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) of the α1-subunit, resulting in epilepsy (62, 66).",0187312c-9876-4bcf-8310-cb83a46945b1
36,discussion4," By inhibiting p97, α1(A322D) subunits have more time to fold in the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing functional GABAA receptors to form and act as inhibitory ion channels (62). Our findings suggest that further analysis of a role for decanoic acid in inhibiting p97 and mTORC1 may identify associated therapeutic benefits.  Our data suggest a mechanism for decanoic acid in regulating mTORC1 independent of glucose and insulin. The classical ketogenic diet is known to reduce mTORC1 activation, with a proposed mechanism through lowering glucose and insulin levels (1–4) associated with the therapeutic effects of the classical ketogenic diet in treating epilepsy. However, the role of the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet fatty acids in this function has not previously been reported.",44b11767-4786-4794-b84e-b5d6dd198151
37,discussion5," Several studies have suggested that decanoic acid in the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet provides therapeutic benefits in seizure control (5, 26, 27, 67), and here we have identified that in Dictyostelium, decanoic acid inhibits mTORC1 activity under conditions of constant glucose and in the absence of insulin (Fig. 1E). Since we have translated this effect to both a rat hippocampal slice model (Fig. 6) and patient-derived astrocytes (Fig. 7), again under conditions of constant glucose and in the absence of insulin signaling, our data support an evolutionarily conserved effect of decanoic acid, provided in the medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet, distinct from that proposed for the classical ketogenic diet.  The mTORC1 pathway acts as a regulator for cell growth through the phosphorylation of targets activating anabolic processes and inhibiting catabolic processes.",6d4dcf43-1dd7-4561-97c0-f5b5821257de
38,discussion6," In this role, mTORC1 inhibition has been credited with providing therapeutic effects in many areas of health, including treating epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders, preventing the proliferation of cancer cells, improving cognitive function after traumatic brain injury, and increasing longevity (8–10). mTORC1 inhibition has also been investigated as a therapeutic target for the neurodevelopmental disorder tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) associated with deregulated mTORC1 activity (11, 13, 14, 68). The cause of epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients is often related to the formation of cortical tubers, characterized by cortical dyslamination, dysplastic neurons, and astrogliosis (69). Although astrogliosis may be secondary to neuronal pathology, studies in animals and humans suggest that tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) involves a primary defect in astrocytes (55), supported by mTOR dysregulation (70).",9b4244ca-8157-4c6f-ae3c-f48a930943d1
39,discussion7," In cell culture, however, patient-derived cells have been suggested to employ a feedback loop to regulate the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and maintain balanced mTOR signaling (71). Importantly, we show that decanoic acid reduces mTORC1 signaling in cells derived from both healthy individuals and patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) mutations, suggesting that decanoic acid functions independent of disease state and shows efficacy in cells derived from patients with disease-associated mutations (Fig. 7). However, heterogeneity between astrocytes derived from patients with mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)2 were observed (SI Appendix, Fig. S10), which suggests that decanoic acid might provide differential efficacy between individuals.  Inhibition of mTORC1 has been suggested to provide wide-ranging clinical benefits, including as a treatment for cancer, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging (14, 72–76).",803cb49e-aa00-4f93-855c-b65edc8617d4
40,discussion8," The recent development of new pharmacological inhibitors for mTORC1 inhibition, based around rapamycin, have focused on identifying “rapalogues” without the toxicity associated with rapamycin (68). Alternately, inhibition of this pathway is possible through dietary treatment, namely the classical ketogenic diet (1–4); however, this diet is highly restrictive for patients, resulting in low compliance. Our data suggest that a nonketogenic decanoic acid-rich diet that is less restrictive and avoids the potential adverse effects of ketosis could also provide therapeutic effects through inhibiting this pathway. Thus, further investigation into dietary decanoic acid may provide a useful approach to treat mTORopathies in addition to providing a range of associated health effects.
