0,introduction0,"One main goal of microbiome studies is to determine which taxa, if any, drive phenotypic changes among study groups1–3. The first step in this process is often to survey which microbial taxa differ in abundance between study groups (differentially abundant taxa). This survey is commonly performed by amplifying the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon with “universal” primer sets before high-throughput sequencing4. The output of these studies provides the relative, not absolute, abundance of each taxon in each sample. Researchers often then use standard statistical tests or microbiome-specific packages to determine which taxa are differentially abundant5,6.  Relative-abundance analyses are effective for determining the major microbial taxa in an environment (e.g., the human Microbiome Project). However, several researchers have pointed out the inherent limitations of comparing relative abundances between samples7–10.",08fc0c15-ac43-465d-89d8-c297551a31d1
1,introduction1," In analyses of relative data, every increase in one taxon’s abundance causes an equivalent decrease across the remaining taxa. Thus, the measurement of a taxon’s relative abundance is dependent on the abundance of all other taxa, which can lead to high false-positive rates in differential taxon analyses8,11–13 and negative correlation biases in correlation-based analyses14,15. Several methods (e.g., ALDEx216, Ancom17, Gneiss18, Differential Ranking10) acknowledge these biases and aim to address them by using the ratios among taxa, which are conserved regardless of whether the data are relative or absolute. These methods are particularly valuable because they enable improved re-analysis of existing datasets reporting relative abundances10,16–18.  Despite such methodological advancements, analyses of relative abundance cannot fully capture how individual microbial taxa differ among samples or experimental conditions. Using the simple example of a community containing two taxa (Fig.",1a172e91-f857-411d-b1ad-17e7acf2906e
2,introduction2," 1), we see that an increase in the ratio between Taxon A and Taxon B could indicate one of five scenarios: (i) Taxon A increased (Fig. 1a), (ii) Taxon B decreased (Fig. 1b), (iii) A combination of 1 and 2, (iv) Taxon A and Taxon B increased but Taxon A increased by a greater magnitude, or (v) Taxon A and Taxon B decreased but Taxon B decreased by a greater magnitude (Fig. 1c). Knowing which of these five scenarios occurs when analyzing experimental data could drastically alter the interpretation of which taxa are positively or negatively associated with phenotypes. Thus, an inherent limitation of methods that use relative abundance is that they cannot determine whether an individual taxon is more abundant or less abundant (the direction of the change) or by how much (the magnitude of the change) between two experimental conditions or samples.Fig. 1 The value of absolute (compared with relative) quantification illustrated by three hypothetical scenarios.",b5340db4-6ceb-4c4f-8878-c0af8a5cc5a7
3,introduction3," In this hypothetical, two taxa (Taxon A and Taxon B) are found in equal abundance (50:50) in a “healthy” state but in an 80:20 ratio in the “disease” state. Three possible scenarios arise: a Taxon A increases in abundance while Taxon B remains the same; b Taxon A remains unchanged while Taxon B decreases in abundance, and c Taxon A and Taxon B both decrease, but Taxon B decreases by a greater magnitude.    To overcome these limitations, several important methods have been developed for quantifying the absolute abundance of microbial taxa by using known “anchor” points to convert relative data to absolutes. Spiked standards are commonly used in method calibration and have recently been applied to quantifying taxa in microbiome research19–23. These methods require a purified DNA sequence of known concentration from an organism not present in the sample and an estimate of the initial sample concentration to determine the amount of exogenous DNA to spike-in.",c09081e3-f0d8-4d76-95c5-ae2845284432
4,introduction4," Another group of anchoring methods, such as those that use flow cytometry24, total DNA25, or quantitative PCR (qPCR)26–28, measure the total concentration of cells, DNA, or amplicons to transform the relative abundances to absolute numbers. These methods have already demonstrated the value of quantitative microbiome analysis, yet microbiome researchers have not yet uniformly adopted these methods. One may speculate that this lack of adoption is because of real or potential limitations of these methods. For example, flow cytometry-based methods require dissociating the sample into single bacterial cells, which could require complex sample preparation and have not been validated with complex samples such as from gut mucosa. Total-DNA-based methods are limited to samples only containing microbial DNA (no host DNA), and spike-in or qPCR-based methods can be limited by amplification biases29,30.",68f21990-371e-4e38-aaab-92e563eae749
5,introduction5," To increase utilization of quantitative microbiome analyses, the following capabilities and validation need to be demonstrated: (i) performance across samples with microbial loads ranging from high, as in stool, to low, as in the small-intestine; (ii) performance across biogeographically diverse sample types, from microbe-rich stool and colonic contents to host-rich mucosal samples; (iii) explicit evaluation of limits of quantification of the method, and how these limits depend on the starting microbial load, relative abundance of a specific target taxon in the sample, and sequencing depth.  To address this challenge, in this paper we establish a rigorous, absolute quantification framework based on digital PCR (dPCR) anchoring. We chose dPCR as our anchoring method because PCR is already part of sequencing protocols and has been extensively validated as a quantitative method in nucleic-acid measurements.",8174df9c-4d5c-4d79-9415-c65b807ff7de
6,introduction6," To achieve precise measurements of absolute abundance from diverse sample types, we assessed the efficiency and evenness of the DNA extraction protocol. To minimize and quantify bias resulting from potentially uneven amplification of microbial 16S rRNA gene DNA, or non-specific amplification of host DNA, we utilized dPCR in a microfluidic format31–33. dPCR is an ultrasensitive method for counting single molecules of DNA or RNA34–36. By dividing a PCR reaction into thousands of nanoliter droplets and counting the number of “positive” wells (those with amplified template), dPCR yields absolute quantification without a standard curve. To understand the quantitative limits of our methodology, we measured the accuracy of each taxon’s absolute abundance as a factor of both input DNA amount and individual taxon relative abundance37–39. We then evaluated this absolute quantification workflow by performing a murine ketogenic-diet study that illustrates how the selection of relative- vs.",7c9c18c1-d7c6-48e7-a2cc-242f3c8e5230
7,introduction7," absolute-quantification analyses can result in different interpretations of the same experimental results. Many studies have shown that ketogenic diets can induce substantial compositional changes in gut-microbiota40–42, so, we predicted it would serve as a good illustrative model for our workflow. Finally, we applied this workflow to an analysis of microbial loads along the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract to highlight the importance of judicious selection of sample location when evaluating the impact of diet on host phenotype, and to highlight the applicability of this workflow to GI sites with diverse microbial loads.

Feature loadings for each principal component were calculated by multiplying each eigenvector by the square-root of its corresponding eigenvalue. All data were visualized using matplotlib and seaborn.  Taxa limits of quantification Poisson confidence intervals were calculated by bootstrapping Poisson samples for rate parameters across the percentage abundance range (0–1) corresponding to either the input DNA copies or number of reads. We took 104 bootstrap replicates with a Poisson sample size of 4 to match the number of replicates we sequenced. The %CV for each replicate was calculated and the middle 95th percentile was shown as the confidence interval.  Thresholds for percentage abundance were calculated by first fitting a negative exponential curve y = ax−b to the plot of %CV vs. percentage abundance using SciPy.,5afd3659-31e8-473c-a863-ca4678cb6d2e
18,methods10," Then the percentage abundance at a given %CV threshold was determined. This process was repeated after subsampling the data at decreasing read depths to find the relationship between percent abundance accuracy limits and sequencing depth.  Measurement uncertainty When measuring the absolute abundance of a given taxon in a sample, many factors contribute to the uncertainty of the measurement. Two primary factors, extraction efficiency and average amplification efficiency for each taxon, should be equivalent for each taxon across samples processed under identical conditions and thus neither should impact the discovery of differential taxa. However, other factors contributing to the uncertainty of an absolute-abundance measurement vary among samples and can impact the discovery of differential taxa.",82e9d852-fb6c-47a4-bdd3-2d4cef9d04a2
19,methods11," At least six independent errors can contribute to the overall uncertainty of a taxon’s absolute abundance: (i) extraction error (ii) the Poisson sampling error of dPCR, (iii) the Poisson sampling error of sample input into an amplification reaction to make a sequencing library, (iv) the uncertainty in the amplification rates among sequences, (v) the Poisson sampling error of the sequencing machine, and (vi) the uncertainty in taxonomic assignment resulting from different software programs that differ in how they convert raw sequencing reads to a table of read counts per taxon.  To measure the total error in our absolute-abundance measurements, we compared the true absolute load value of four “representative” taxa (taxa that are common gut flora from different taxonomic ranks) as measured by taxon-specific dPCR, with the value obtained from our method of quantitative sequencing with dPCR anchoring (Fig.",b24a7d58-3a2e-46b8-8767-73a53ed11393
20,methods12," 3b) and then analyzed the relative error in these measurements, defined as the log2 of the observed taxon load over the true taxon load. We constructed a quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plot (Supplementary Fig. 9) of the mean-centered log2 relative errors and found that the errors appeared normally distributed. We confirmed this by running a Shapiro–Wilk test (P-value = 0.272) on the mean-centered log2 relative errors, which uses a null hypothesis that the dataset comes from a normal distribution. The standard deviation of the mean-centered log2 relative errors was 0.48, which results in a 95% confidence interval of ~(−1,1), indicating a 2x precision on each individual measurement. However, as seen with Akkermansia(g) (Fig. 3b), accuracy offsets may exist for specific taxa. It is important to note that all samples used in this analysis had relative abundances above the 50% CV threshold defined in Fig.",6fa53995-0271-4fd1-9220-dc745ccd66e5
21,methods13," 2d, and thus we do not make any conclusions about the precision of absolute-abundance measurements for taxa with relative abundances below the 50% CV threshold.  Biological uncertainty and statistical inference methods When measuring the absolute abundance of a taxon from a defined population (e.g., healthy adults, mice on a ketogenic diet) it is unlikely this abundance comes from a well-defined statistical distribution. Given this inherent limitation, we used non-parametric statistical tests, which do not rely on distributional assumptions, for our differential abundance analyses.  Statistical comparisons between diet groups were analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis46 rank sums test with Benjamini–Hochberg47 multiple hypothesis testing correction. All statistical tests were implemented using SciPy.stats Kruskal function and statsmodels.stats.multitest multipletests function with the fdr_bh option for Benjamini–Hochberg multiple-testing correction.",bc75f9a7-1c44-49c7-ab80-95d237324f40
22,methods14," When calculating differentially abundant taxa, only taxa present in at least 4 out of 6 mice in a group were considered to remove fold-change outliers when plotting (Fig. 6a, b).  Correlation analysis Samples were separated by diet (ketogenic and control) and only stool samples were used (days 4, 7, and 10). The total microbial load and top 30 taxa with the highest average absolute abundance were selected for analysis. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and corresponding P-values were calculated for all pairwise interactions using the scipy.stats.spearmanr function. Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was to calculate q-values, which account for multiple hypothesis testing. A heatmap of the diagonal correlation matrix was plotted (Supplementary Fig. 8) for q-values <10% false discovery rate (FDR).

25,results0,"Efficient DNA extraction across microbial loads and sample types To estimate the maximum quantity of sample we could extract before exceeding the capacity of a 20-µg column, we measured total DNA and microbial DNA load across small-intestine and large-intestine lumenal and mucosal samples (Supplementary Fig. 1).

We spiked a defined 8-member microbial community into GI samples taken from germ-free (GF) mice. To assess quantitative limits, we performed a dilution series of microbial spike-in from 1.4 × 109 CFU/mL to 1.4 × 105 CFU/mL. dPCR quantification showed near equal and complete recovery of microbial DNA over 5 orders of magnitude (Fig. 2a).",fd744e38-d367-452d-a082-43dc750438d4

Next, to ensure extraction performance was consistent for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microbes, we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using previously described improved primers and protocol31,33 on a subset of the extracted samples (Fig. 2b). It is important to note that all amplification reactions for 16S rRNA gene library prep were monitored with real-time qPCR and we stopped the reactions when they reached the late exponential phase to limit overamplification and chimera formation30–33,43,44. Extraction appeared less even among microbial taxa at lower total microbial DNA inputs (Fig. 2b).",70ed886f-0108-4451-9e75-627cabac6353
29,results4," This discrepancy from the theoretical profile did not correlate with the presence of chimeric sequences (Supplementary Fig. 3) and was likely a function of the reduced accuracy incurred when diluting complex microbial samples. Additionally, sequencing samples with low total microbial loads (<1 × 104 16S rRNA gene copies) resulted in the presence of contaminants, as confirmed by sequencing of negative control extractions (Supplementary Table 1).  Quantitative limits of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing To establish the precision of relative-abundance measurements, we sequenced four replicates of DNA extractions from cecum samples. Libraries from one DNA extraction were prepared with either an input of 1.2 × 107 16S rRNA gene copies or 1.2 × 104 16S rRNA gene copies to determine the impact of starting DNA amount on sequencing variability. We calculated the coefficient of variation (%CV) for each taxon’s relative abundance from amplicon sequencing the replicate samples.",e56763a8-e311-4cca-a217-accee1de7b21
30,results5," Each taxon’s mean relative abundance (n = 4) was then plotted against its corresponding coefficient of variation of the relative abundance (Fig. 2c). We defined “dropouts” as taxa present only in the high-DNA-input sample whereas we defined “contaminants” as taxa present only in the low-DNA-input sample. The two dropout taxa in the low-input sample corresponded to the lowest abundance taxa from the high-input DNA sample (yellow points, Fig. 2c). Most of the contaminant taxa in the low-input sample had a relative abundance <0.03%, but three taxa (Pseudomonas(g), Acinetobacter(g), Rhizobiales(f)) had relative abundances of 0.38%, 0.35%, and 0.1%, respectively. These three taxa were also the three most common contaminants in our negative control extractions (Supplementary Table 1). The presence of contaminants in the sample containing 1.2 × 104 16S rRNA gene copies was consistent with the input amount at which we observed contaminants in our mixed microbial community dilutions (Fig. 2b).",8f631491-4d1b-4e67-8d27-ff04946d4f96
31,results6," We calculated a bootstrapped Poisson sampling confidence interval at our sequencing depth (28,000 reads) to assess how close our accuracy limits were to the theoretical limits (red shading, Fig. 2c). At the low-DNA input level of 1.2 × 104 16S rRNA gene copies, we began to reach the fundamental Poisson loading limit in our library-preparation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 4a). We expected divergence of the %CV at ~0.01% abundance because at a read depth of 28,000 a relative abundance of 0.01% is a measure of ~3 reads whereas at a total 16S rRNA gene copy input of 1.4 × 104 a relative abundance of 0.01% is ~1 copy. Poisson statistics also helped us define the theoretical lower limits of relative-abundance measurements as a factor of sequencing depth (Supplementary Fig. 4b).",a0bf8f31-33e4-4488-b6e3-1ce63ba83ea4
32,results7,"  We next wished to quantify an approximate threshold that would tell us, for a given sequencing depth, at what percentage of relative abundance we lose accuracy in our measurements (we defined this threshold as “relative abundance threshold”). To determine this threshold, we fit a negative exponential to the replicate data and identified the percentage abundance at which 30% CV was observed. This threshold is a function of the sequencing depth, so we subsampled the data at decreasing read counts and repeated the exponential fitting method to calculate the relationship between the relative abundance threshold and sequencing depth (Fig. 2d). Greater sequencing depths yielded lower quantitative limits with diminishing returns, as expected. We found that the threshold for percentage abundance decreases with increasing sequencing depth with a square-root dependence analogous to the square-root dependence of Poisson noise. This trend follows for %CV thresholds of 40% and 50% as well (Fig.",f0b6cc42-2742-4273-822c-1e717fbb17c5
33,results8," 2d). This analysis provides a framework with which to impose thresholds on relative-abundance data that are grounded on the calculated limits of quantitation.  Absolute quantification of taxa via digital PCR (dPCR) anchoring We calculated absolute abundances of taxa from sequencing data using dPCR measurement of total microbial loads as an anchor. Briefly, relative abundance of each taxon was measured by sequencing and these numbers were multiplied by the total number of 16S rRNA gene copies (obtained using the same universal primers from amplicon sequencing, without the barcodes) from dPCR. Next, we evaluated the accuracy of this quantitative-sequencing approach. Typically, evaluation of quantitative accuracy and precision would involve the use of a mock microbial community (like the one used in Fig. 2).",5ec1f70a-d12d-4482-8184-62a889c7f7e9
34,results9," However, because we computed the absolute instead of relative abundances, we were able to use the actual gut-microbiota samples and compare the results to the dPCR data obtained with relevant taxon-specific primers. The 16S rRNA gene copy amount was then normalized to the mass of each extracted sample after correcting for volume losses (Materials and methods; Eq. 1). We chose four representative taxa to encompass common gut flora of varying classification levels: Akkermansia muciniphila(s), Lachnospiraceae(f), Bacteroidales(o), and Lactobacillaceae(f). Like eubacterial primers, taxon-specific primer sets can (in principle) give rise to non-specific amplification due to overlap with host mitochondrial DNA. To avoid non-specific amplification, we ran temperature gradients with GF mucosal DNA and taxa-specific microbial DNA to identify the optimal annealing temperature for each primer set (Supplementary Fig. 5).",6977f413-1a26-4b3c-ab8f-21707f69b51b
35,results10," Each taxon-specific primer targets a separate region of the 16S rRNA gene than the universal primer set, thus keeping the gene copy-number equivalent across primers. We observed high correlation coefficients between the taxa load determined by quantitative sequencing with dPCR anchoring and the taxa load measured by dPCR with taxa-specific primers (all r2 ≥ 0.97, Fig. 3a) for all four taxa over a range of ~6 orders of magnitude. The ratio of the total load measurements obtained by quantitative sequencing with dPCR anchoring and by dPCR with taxon-specific primers showed unity agreement for three of the four primer sets with twofold deviation from the mean (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 9). Sequencing quantification was consistently 2.5-fold higher than dPCR quantification for the species Akkermansia muciniphila (Fig. 3b). We cannot confirm amplification bias as a factor because the error did not depend on the number of cycles used in library preparation.",c3643800-6752-4e66-b65b-1550e5cca553
36,results11, An alternative factor could be a discrepancy in coverage/specificity between the taxon-specific and universal primer sets. We next tested the limits of the sequencing accuracy as a factor of input DNA load. A 10x dilution series of a cecum sample was created to cover input DNA loads of 1 × 108 copies down to 1 × 104 copies. Minimal differences in beta diversity (Aitchison distance) between the undiluted and diluted samples were observed with a trend towards increasing difference with decreasing DNA load (Fig. 3c). This negative correlation between beta diversity and microbial load is not unexpected due to the higher presence of contaminant species from our negative controls in the lower input samples (Fig. 2b).Fig. 3 Digital PCR (dPCR) anchoring of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing provides microbial absolute-abundance measurements.

Absolute vs. relative abundance analysis in a ketogenic-diet study To test the impact of using a quantitative framework for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we performed a ketogenic-diet study.

Stool was sampled immediately before the two diets were introduced (day 0), and again at days 4, 7, and 10. Additionally, on day 10, all mice were euthanized and lumenal and mucosal samples were collected from throughout the GI tract (Fig. 4a).

Common transformation techniques based on non-Euclidian distances (e.g., Bray–Curtis, UniFrac) can skew the accuracy of visualizations of relative data (Supplementary Fig. 6a)11. We used the centered log-ratio transformation (CLR, often used to compute the Aitchison distance) to handle compositional effects, and performed Principal component analysis (PCA) on the transformed absolute-abundance data for all samples from the final collection day (Fig. 4c). A clear separation along the first two principal components (PC) was observed. Separation along PC1 was related to the location within the GI tract whereas separation along PC2 was related to the diet.",33af047e-eead-48ab-aafc-798d754d73ac
43,results18," The Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis suggested that stomach samples were distributed somewhere in-between small-intestine and large-intestine samples, possibly resulting from coprophagy in mice32,33. Additionally, the mucosal and lumenal samples from the small-intestine on the control diet seemed to be closer together than on the ketogenic diet (Fig. 4c).  We next investigated which taxa were contributing to separation in our principal component space. We calculated the scaled covariance between each taxon and the first two principal components by multiplying the eigenvectors by the square-root of their corresponding eigenvalues. These values are also known as “feature loadings.",23d4fcc7-ee2e-4a0b-9480-6ff500987997
44,results19,"” Plotting these feature loadings from smallest to highest shows that Lactobacillus(g) and Lactococcus(g) had the greatest impact on separation along PC1 in the direction of the small intestinal samples whereas Ruminiclostridium(g) and Lachnospiraceae(f) separated in the direction of the large-intestine (Fig. 4d). This matches with what we know about the major genera commonly present in the small and large-intestine45. Along PC2 (the “diet axis”), the top two contributing taxa towards the control diet were Turicibacter(g) and Marvinbryantia(g), while towards the ketogenic diet Akkermansia(g) and Enterococcus(g) had the greatest covariance.  Although the CLR transformation preserves distances in principal component space regardless of whether the starting data are relative or absolute, it normalizes out the differences in total loads by looking at log ratios between each taxon’s abundance and the geometric mean of the sample (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Fig. 6b).",ea0d691c-0031-4d95-a689-cddff400930f
45,results20," In many cases, we want to know if the absolute load of a taxon is higher or lower under different conditions (e.g., in mice on ketogenic and control diets). When the total microbial load varies among samples, analyses of relative abundance cannot determine which taxa are differentially abundant (Fig. 1). To assess the impact of using absolute quantification in analyses, we analyzed microbiomes of stool samples from mice on ketogenic and control diets. Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis on the CLR-transformed relative abundances of microbial taxa showed separation between the two diets (Fig. 5a). Feature loadings were analyzed as before, but this time total impact of each taxon on the PC space was plotted, which was defined as the sum of the feature loading vectors in PC1 and PC2 (Fig. 5b).

Analysis of relative-abundance data implies that Akkermansia(g) has the biggest contribution on separation between diets in PC space whereas the absolute-abundance data implies that ~40% of the taxa in the sample have a greater contribution than Akkermansia(g) to the separation between the diets in PC space.Fig. 5 Analyses of relative and absolute microbial abundances from the same dataset result in different conclusions.",d527af1f-a774-435b-887e-72e2566987a0

Principal component analysis (PCA) is only an exploratory data-analysis technique, so we next used a non-parametric statistical test to test for differentially abundant taxa in stool samples from mice on control and ketogenic diets (Fig. 5c)46. We performed separate analyses of the relative and absolute-abundance data. We plotted the –log10 P-value for each taxon’s relative abundances against the corresponding –log10 P-value for that taxon’s absolute abundances.

50,results25," Neither of these analyses is wrong, they are simply asking two different questions: with relative data, the question is whether the percentage of that microbe is different between two conditions whereas with absolute data, the question is whether the load of that microbe is different between two conditions.  To explore one example of how different interpretations of how taxa differ between study conditions occur when using relative vs. absolute abundance, we analyzed Akkermansia(g) in stool across each of the three time points on experimental diets (days 4, 7, and 10) and day 0 on chow diet. For simplicity in this illustration, we compared data from one mouse on each diet (Fig. 5d), but the trends hold on average between all mice on the two diets (Supplementary Fig. 7). Analysis of relative microbial abundance demonstrated ~3X higher abundance of Akkermansia(g) in samples from the ketogenic compared with the control diet on days 7 and 10.",de82f545-f4a6-4c38-a51c-fab85d6b11fa
51,results26," However, when analyzing the difference in absolute abundance, more nuanced conclusions emerged. The rise in Akkermansia(g) results from switching mice from chow to experimental diets. The resulting Akkermansia(g) loads are similar in the two diets on days 7 and 10. However, the ketogenic diet reduces the total microbial load relative to both chow and control diets, therefore leading to the observed higher % of Akkermansia(g) in samples from mice on ketogenic diet.  Absolute abundances allow for quantitative differential taxon analysis We next analyzed the absolute microbiota abundances in stool and lower small intestinal mucosa samples from day 10. A volcano plot, akin to those used in gene expression studies, was used to represent the overall changes in taxa abundances between the two diets, and the absolute abundance of each taxon was indicated by the size of its symbol (Fig. 6a).",652c215b-cd77-4711-bac5-869fe2b53f5b

56,results31,"  A further breakdown of the differential taxa, using our quantitative limits of sequencing accuracy (defined earlier), allowed us to categorize four distinct scenarios that describe how microbes differed between GI locations of mice on the two diets. We refer to these four scenarios as “quantification classes” (Fig. 6c, d). First, there were microbes that were present in one diet and absent in the other (“presence/absence” class). For example, Dorea(g), in stool, and Escherichia(g), in SI mucosa, were absent from the control diet but present in the ketogenic diet. Second, there were microbes above the detection limit but below the quantitative limit in both diets (“no quant” class). For example, in stool, Candidatus Soleaferrea(g), ranges in relative abundance from 0.002% to 0.025%, well below the 30% CV quantification threshold of 0.04% (as defined in Fig. 2d). Thus, we cannot quantitatively define the difference of this microbe between mice on the two diets.",770fb87a-0fc5-4be3-8d55-08c9aa07942d
57,results32," Third, microbes were above the detection limit in both diets but only above the quantitative limit in one of the diets (“semi-quant” class). For example, Desulfovibrionaceae(f) in the lower small-intestine mucosa was above the detection limit in mice on both diets but only above the quantitative limit in mice on the ketogenic diet, so although we can be confident that a difference between the diets exists, we cannot be confident in our measurement of the magnitude of that difference. Fourth, microbes were found above the quantitative limits in both diets (“quant” class). For example, for Parabacteroides(g) in stool, we can be confident in both the difference between the diets (it was more abundant in the control diet) and in the magnitude of that difference (a 32.2-fold difference). We have the lowest confidence in the measured absolute fold change of a taxon that is classified in the presence/absence class, and the greatest confidence in a taxon in the quant class.

58,discussion0,"In this study, we have shown that this technology performs across biogeographically diverse samples with microbial loads spanning over 6 orders of magnitude. Our lower limits of quantification for total microbial load from lumenal (e.g., stool, cecum contents) and mucosal samples were 4.2 × 105 16S rRNA gene copies/g and 1.0 × 107 16S rRNA gene copies/g, respectively. These lower limits were mainly restricted by the column-based extractions used which require <200 mg of sample input for lumenal contents and <8 mg of input for mucosal samples. This sample input is limited by the high concentration of PCR inhibitors and host DNA in these samples. New sample-processing methods that deplete host DNA before extraction (e.g., the use of propidium monoazide (propidium monoazide (PMA)) or saponin with DNase)48,49 could help improve the quantitative limits in samples with high levels of host DNA (e.g., mucosa) by removing non-microbial DNA before extraction.",01465a78-e90e-408a-8064-38300692a7a2
59,discussion1," Such host-depletion methods could also improve performance of other current or future methods of quantitative sequencing. Before these methods are introduced into quantitative-sequencing protocols, they will require extensive validation to understand the impacts host DNA depletion has on the microbial load and composition of these samples, which will affect the accuracy of any absolute-abundance technique. We showed that the precision of any individual taxon’s abundance can be defined as a function of that taxon’s relative abundance and the sequencing depth. These accuracy thresholds generally state that all taxa with relative abundance >0.01% have a maximum %CV of 30%. We did not quite reach the theoretical limit of Poisson precision (Fig. 2c), which might be explained by slight differences in PCR amplification between high- and low-abundance microbes, and could potentially be corrected with single-molecule counting techniques utilizing unique molecular identifiers (UMIs)50,51.",ac165f14-bd5c-4e19-ad5a-80924597a88f
60,discussion2," Interestingly, the precision of these abundance measurements did not differ between high-input DNA samples (1.2 × 107 16S rRNA gene copies) and low-input DNA samples (1.2 × 104 16S rRNA gene copies), even though the low-input sample required ten additional PCR cycles. The lack of an increase in observed chimeric sequences in the low-input sample indicates that PCR bias from chimera generation may occur mainly during overamplification; thus, we suggest monitoring library-prep amplification reactions with qPCR and stopping reactions during the late exponential phase30–33,43,44.  Our quantitative-sequencing method, as validated, is subject to some of the same limitations of general 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Primarily, the accuracy of any given taxon’s abundance is believed to be impacted by amplification bias.",b288978e-dd8d-4f4c-9643-729e5ac72501
61,discussion3," We showed that the abundances of Akkermansia muciniphila(s), Lachnospiraceae(f), Bacteroidales(o), and Lactobacillaceae(f) could be quantified with similar precision (2×), but different accuracy, i.e., Akkermansia muciniphila(s) abundance was ~2.5X higher in the quantitative-sequencing estimate compared with the estimate from dPCR with taxa-specific primers. This offset was consistent between samples with varying amplification cycles, indicating that it may be related to differences in primer coverage between the taxon-specific primer set and the universal primer set used in this study. Nevertheless, such offsets should be similar if the same library-prep conditions are used, so one can reliably compare taxa among groups or studies and the use of UMIs may further eliminate any potential amplification biases. We note that dPCR-based total microbial load measurements should be more robust to amplification biases of individual taxa.",9ffd42ea-3aef-4262-a70b-2df6a7e2a1c5
62,discussion4," Additionally, the total microbial load measurement will be affected by the 16S rRNA primer set chosen and its respective taxonomic coverage. The primers in this study were chosen to have broad coverage and also to limit amplification of host mitochondrial DNA31–33, to ensure proper quantification of mucosal and small-intestine samples with high host DNA loads. Finally, to take full advantage of the power of this quantitative framework, study designs must incorporate proper sampling techniques to address spatiotemporal variation in microbial abundances22.  A method-specific limitation is the requirement of an additional step, dPCR total microbial load quantification, which consumes a portion of the extracted DNA sample. This limitation is minor because dPCR generally requires at least 100 copies for a measurement with a ~10% Poisson error, which is much less than the roughly 10,000 copies required for sequencing.",39707b18-c6c9-42b9-966f-92b01c39d621
63,discussion5," Additionally, the absolute abundances are reported in 16S rRNA gene copies/g and require conversion to number of cells/g, which has standard limitations (e.g., the completeness of rRNA databases and copy-number variation among similar species). However, when comparing taxa across study groups, the 16S rRNA gene copies per taxonomic group should be similar. Finally, this method was only validated for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing; thus, further validation would be required for applying this method to converting metagenomic sequencing from relative to absolute quantification. We were not able to directly compare our measurements to other absolute-abundance techniques discussed in the Introduction because these techniques have not been validated on the broad range of sample types and microbial loads tested here (Supplementary Table 2).",7d412dfe-f4fb-4a51-a0d3-4f57fdf8eb0d
64,discussion6," A fair side-by-side comparison would require re-optimization of the other techniques for complex sample types, like those with high host DNA levels and low-microbial biomass (e.g., mucosa).  We applied the quantitative framework to a murine ketogenic-diet study to identify how microbial taxa at several GI locations respond to diet. As total microbial loads were lower in the ketogenic diet compared with the control, analysis of absolute abundance was required to correctly identify differential taxa. The lower load observed on the ketogenic diet can likely be explained by its lower fiber and carbohydrate content, as these dietary components are main substrates for many gut microbes52. Many factors (including diet) that induce changes in relative microbial abundances can also impact total microbial load25,53. Even among healthy mice on the same (chow) diet, total microbial loads in stool can differ by 10 times25.",3b81c5cf-a755-4690-a092-1456af9a1ec1
65,discussion7," Such variation in total microbial load likely contributes to the noise in microbiome studies. Another insight of this study was that we found different patterns in the microbial communities at each GI sampling site. For example, Akkermansia(g) loads did not differ between diets in stool, but they were significantly greater in the small-intestine mucosa in the ketogenic diet compared with the control. Bacteroides(g) load was lower in stool and greater in the small-intestine mucosa in the ketogenic relative to the control diet. Clearly, differential taxa at one GI location cannot be used as a proxy for measuring differential taxa at another GI location. To our knowledge, this is the first microbiome study to show that microbial taxa in the small-intestine and the stool can change in different directions and by different magnitudes in response to diet. Furthermore, for each taxon, this method enables a comparison of absolute microbial abundance to limits of detection and quantification.",661e1593-9a4d-491c-9c19-bcf8a415b927
66,discussion8," This comparison separates differential taxa into four classes (Quant, Semi-Quant, No Quant, Presence/Absence), which provide a convenient shortcut for more quantitative interpretation of microbiome studies. It should be noted that the absence of a microbe in a dataset is a factor of the sequencing depth, and just because a microbe is not found in the sequencing data does not mean it is not in the sample. However, with absolute anchoring, one can confidently say that when a microbe is not found, that microbe is below a given abundance.  We have not focused on correlations among taxa in this dataset. However, the absolute-abundance measurements acquired using our method should help overcome many of the limitations of correlation-based analyses on relative abundances54,55 and enable analyses using standard methodologies like Spearman’s rank correlation (Supplementary Fig. 8).",a706fcc3-3258-4b14-adc8-5cf2bf60770f
67,discussion9," However, further work will be required to properly address the impact that correlations between total microbial loads will have on taxon-based correlation networks. In addition, new statistical and/or experimental design methods may be required for interpreting the correlations between a taxon’s presence and/or total load and observed phenotypes.  This method overcomes three bottlenecks to wider adoption of absolute quantitative measurements in microbiome analysis: (i) performance across samples with a wide range of microbial loads; (ii) performance across biogeographically diverse sample types; (iii) explicit evaluation of limits of quantification of the method. This method will be useful in other areas that benefit from quantitative analysis, such as monitoring microbial communities during manufacturing of complex probiotic mixtures56 and monitoring changes of host-associated microbial communities over time (e.g.",4cdd38d1-a3e1-4eea-b68e-c34e5064365a

Applying absolute quantification19–21,23–28,32,33 of microbial taxa to biogeographically relevant GI locations will provide researchers with new insights in how microbial communities affect host phenotypes.
