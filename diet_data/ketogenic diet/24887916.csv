0,introduction0,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extra-cranial solid malignancy of childhood. This tumor of the peripheral nervous system originates from primitive sympathogonia that normally give rise to the postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic chain and the adrenal medulla [1]. Based on biological and clinical features, the disease can be classified into three risk categories. In the high-risk patient population, despite extensive efforts to improve treatment strategies, the prognosis is poor, with an estimated 5-year survival of 50%. This contrasts to an overall survival rate exceeding 90% in the intermediate- and low-risk groups, where treatment optimization has shifted toward reducing the toxicities of the multi-modal therapy approach [2].",0f6bb6b3-2595-4b4d-b20b-a87c843213b4
1,introduction1,"  The mitochondrial energy metabolism of NB is characterized by generalized low protein and activity levels of the oxidative phosphorylation (of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)) complexes, along with a low copy number of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). Mitochondrial mass, however, as quantified by markers such as citrate synthase activity and voltage-dependent ion channel (voltage dependent ion channel (VDAC)) protein content, is similar to that of normal adrenal gland and kidney tissues [3]. Although the mechanisms inducing this phenotype are still under investigation, data indicate that it is part of the metabolic reprogramming of NB cells that permits the state of low differentiation and high proliferative capacity. Changes in mitochondrial function have been shown to be a central component of the induction of differentiation in NB cell lines. Retinoic acid treatment, for instance, significantly increases basal oxygen consumption as well as respiratory capacity [4–6].",16ed2d47-3105-4a86-a221-93c249182c58
2,introduction2,"  These observations are in line with the reprogramming of cancer cell metabolism to increased glucose utilization, one of the hallmarks in cancer development [7–9]. The dependency of cancer cells on anaerobic glycolysis, even when there is sufficient oxygen available to shunt pyruvate into the of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway, is widely known as the Warburg effect [10]. Isolated defects in enzymes of the of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system can be a direct cause of cancer formation and the Warburg effect, as exemplified in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (both with defects in complex II) or oncocytomas (defects in complex I). Other solid tumors such as renal cell carcinomas or NBs are characterized by a more general reduction of all of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes [3, 11–18].",e57f11ed-023a-45e9-bbf8-d64b99f16828
3,introduction3,"  Cancer therapies have always employed approaches targeting phenotypic characteristics of cancer cells that render them more sensitive to a specific treatment than the rest of the body’s cells. Similarly, in radiology, the increased uptake of glucose by cancer cells is widely employed in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography [19]. In contrast, metabolism targeted chemotherapeutics available for clinical application are mainly limited to nucleic acid metabolism (i.e. 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate) and asparaginase treatment [20]. Therapeutic targeting of the glucose-dependency of cancer cells has long focused on the (preclinical) use of 2-deoxyglucose, a compound that is thought to block glycolytic flux. However, this once hopeful approach has failed to translate to the clinic due to its toxicity at high doses, although it is still being evaluated at lower doses [21, 22].",1736a73b-cf0f-498b-943c-73332e6a9512
4,introduction4," Alternative substances that broaden the metabolic targets from glycolysis to lipid- and amino acid metabolism or the tricarboxylic acid cycle are under evaluation [20, 22–25]. Additionally, the adaptation of dietary intake to reduce side effects and/or support cancer therapy is being revisited in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Changing the patient’s nutrition to a ketogenic diet (KD), for instance, is thought to reduce the growth of tumors of the central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)) by shifting abundant blood substrate levels from glucose to ketone bodies and fatty acids [26–33].  KD with or without calorie restriction (CR) has for decades been part of the management of children with intractable seizures [34]. In the pediatric population, KD is widely tolerated without major side effects and has gained attention in treating adolescent and adult therapy-resistant epilepsy [35].",1b2d2aa6-4cc9-47b0-a873-4be9f12a1e09
5,introduction5," Classic regimens (such as the Johns Hopkins protocol) offer a food-content ratio of fats to carbohydrates and proteins of 3:1 or 4:1 (in grams). Adaptations to this basic regimen such as combining it with variable CR or more liberal approaches such as the modified Atkins diet are commonly applied [36, 37]. More recently, KD has been under evaluation for alternative indications such as obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome and degenerative diseases of the nervous system [38]. The molecular mechanism of KD is poorly understood but data point toward multifactorial direct and indirect metabolic adaptations, including increased mitochondrial biogenesis and an altered cellular energy state [36, 39].  Preclinical data on cancers of the central nervous system (CNS) suggest that CR and/or KD can be a potential adjuvant approach in cancer therapy [31, 40–42]. This is supported by two case reports of patients treated with CR-KD [43, 44], but extensive clinical evaluation is lacking.",45b68281-ff81-43f3-9afe-518af962f7b4
6,introduction6," Two pilot studies of KD in 36 adult patients showed that KD can be tolerated in patients with advanced cancers [28, 30]. We recently reported that astrocytomas show a grade-dependent loss of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, further substantiating the glucose-dependency and therefore the likely susceptibility to KD of high-grade neuroepithelial tumors [45]. Our laboratory systematically characterized of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activities in a range of human cancers, since functional data on the of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system in different cancer types are sparse [3, 11–18]. In the present study we chose NB as a model tumor because NBs show a comparable reduction in of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) as neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) [3, 45].",204837b7-82a2-49c6-b558-bd9956dd47c6
7,introduction7," Moreover, in vitro data indicate that NB cells preferentially use glucose over ketone bodies as an energy source [46] and that ketone bodies potentially reduce the viability of NB cells [47]. In the context of this information, we designed a study to evaluate the effects of dietary intervention on the growth of NB xenografts and to monitor potential adaptations of the of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system.

8,methods0,"Cell lines The cell lines SH-SY5Y (ATCC CRL-2266) and SK-N-BE(2) (ATCC CRL-2271) were chosen for the xenograft studies. SH-SY5Y is a TP53 wild-type, non-NMYC-amplified cell line that shows no chromosome 1p loss of heterozygosity and is sensitive to chemotherapy. The SK-N-BE(2) cell line shows high resistance to a wide range of chemotherapeutic agents and is characterized by NMYC amplification, TP53 mutation (p.C135F) and chromosome 1p loss of heterozygosity [48]. Cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium and Ham’s F12 (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA), Glutamax (Gibco), non-essential amino acids (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin (Sigma).

9,methods1," Animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and care conformed to the Austrian Act on Animal Experimentation. Xenografts were established by subcutaneous injection of a 200 μl matrigel (BD Bioscience) / serum-free medium suspension of NB cells (2.7×107) on the right flank of 5- to 6-week-old female CD-1 nude mice (Charles River). After reaching a tumor size of 150 mm3, the mice were randomized to four dietary therapy groups (n = 8–11).  Tumor volumes were measured two times weekly using calipers and calculated with the formula width*height*length/2. Body weight, blood glucose and ketone body levels (beta-hydroxybutyrate) were monitored twice weekly after a two-hour fasting period in the ad libitum fed groups or before feeding in the calorie-restricted groups. The applied technique is widely used in clinical routine diagnostics and utilizes enzymatic based methods for quantification (Precision Xceed, Abbott) [49–51].",eab0c124-9a1c-497b-bd4b-1ce20cfeed81
10,methods2," After inducing sevoflurane anesthesia mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at predetermined days (day 22 SH-SY5Y and day 33 SK-N-BE (2)) or when termination criteria were met (health status, tumor ulceration or volume of 3000 mm3). Cancer tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) measurements and determination of mtDNA copy number. One 0.5-cm tumor slice each was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded for histological analysis.  Food composition and energy content Mice were fed according to four different regimens: standard diet ad libitum (SD), calorie-restricted standard diet (CR-SD), long chain fatty acid based ketogenic diet ad libitum (KD) and calorie-restricted ketogenic diet (CR-KD). The metabolizable energy contents were as follows: SD (kcal: fat 9%, protein 33% and carbohydrates 58%) and long chain fatty acid based KD (kcal: fat 78%, protein 14% and carbohydrates 8%) (No. V1535-000 and No.",1e1d8117-cd8c-4def-89c5-61b21ca9c706

Diets were fortified with vitamins and mineral supplements and differed slightly between the two diets. To determine average calorie intake, 5 mice were monitored for ad libitum feeding for over a 5-week period (SD: mean 6.22 g ± 0.96 /d/mouse; KD: 2.7 ± 0.4 g /d/mouse). For the CR groups, food intake was restricted to 2/3 of the corresponding ad libitum intake. This degree of CR corresponds to those of clinical protocols for therapy-resistant epilepsy [35–37].  Extraction of 600g homogenate A mitochondria-enriched homogenate obtained by differential centrifugation was used for enzyme activity measurement and western blot analysis of of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. This method increases specificity and is also used for the evaluation of inherited metabolic diseases [52, 53].",67725f09-f025-4565-a455-40ca7652ac88
12,methods4," A tissue disintegrator (Ultraturrax, IKA) was used to homogenize NB xenograft tissue (50–100 mg) in SEKT-extraction buffer, pH 7.6 (250 mM sucrose, 2 mM EGTA, 40 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl). Cell membranes were then sheered with a motor-driven Teflon-glass homogenizer (Potter S, Braun). Centrifugation of the homogenate at 600g for 10 min at 4°C yields the post-nuclear supernatant (600g homogenate) containing the mitochondrial fraction.  Enzyme measurements Xenograft 600g homogenate of all cases in the SH-SY5Y groups (each n = 8–11) and of representative cases in the SK-N-BE(2) groups (each n = 5) were used for enzymatic measurements. Activities of all individual enzymes of the of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I-V) and combinations (complexes I+III and complexes II+III) were measured as previously described [3, 11, 54]. In addition, CS activity was measured because it is a well-established marker of mitochondrial mass [55].",e9153b90-c5fc-411b-b92c-3371357b006d
13,methods5," All quantifications were based on spectrophotometric measurements (Uvicon 922, Kontron) and performed at 37°C, with the exception of complex V, 30°C.  In brief: CS (EC 2.3.3.1) activity was recorded according to Srere [56] with modifications as noted in [3]. 10 μl of 600g homogenate was mixed with a Tris-HCl-buffered reaction mixture containing: 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mM Elman’s reagent [5,5’-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)] and 0.15 mM acetyl-CoA. After recording thiolase activity for 2 min, the CS reaction was started by addition of 0.5 mM oxaloacetate and extinction dynamics were followed at 412 nm for 8 min. Rotenone-sensitive complex I activity was measured spectrophotometrically as NADH:decylubiquinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.5.3) at 340 nm. The enzyme activities of complex IV (ferrocytochrome c:oxygen oxidoreductase EC 1.9.3.1) and oligomycin-sensitive complex V ATPase (complex V, F1F0 ATP synthase, EC 3.6.3.",186d668a-f882-40b9-97dc-de9b155caf70

The final reaction mixture for the complex V activity measurement was treated for 10 bursts with an ultra-sonifier (Bio cell disruptor 250, Branson). The complex II (succinate dehydrogenase, succinate:ubiquinone-oxidoreductase EC 1.3.5.1) reaction mixture was pre-incubated for 10 min at 37°C. Quantification was performed for 6 min at 600 nm by monitoring the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol after addition of 10 mM succinate. The reaction mixture for the measurement of the complex III activity (EC 1.10.2.2 coenzyme Q:cytochrome c—oxidoreductase) contained 100 μM cytochrome c and 200 μM reduced decyl-ubiquinol. The reaction was started by addition of the 600g homogenate. After 3–4 min the reaction was inhibited by addition of 1 μM antimycin A. Antimycin A-insensitive activity was subtracted from the total activity to calculate complex III activity.",6e64b211-366c-49d2-822f-86454213ae18
15,methods7," When not stated otherwise, reagents were obtained from SIGMA.  Determination of the mtDNA copy number For the determination of mtDNA copy number, proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics) treatment was performed before extraction of total DNA from tumor tissue [58]. Quantitative real-time PCR (iCycler, BioRad) was performed using two independent mitochondrial (m.6625_6754 and m.9910_10198) and nuclear DNA loci (POLG and RRM2B). Then, mtDNA content was determined by calculating the ratios of the Ct values. MtDNA copy number is given as n/diploid genome (the sequences of the primer-pairs 1–2 and 3–4 are given in S2 Table) [59].  Western blot analysis 600g homogenates were used for western blot analysis as described before [3]. In brief, a total of 10 μg protein was separated on 10% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a CAPS buffer (10 mM 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propane sulfonic acid, pH 11; 10% methanol).",39abb344-ff7b-4e81-9d7f-21a3a955b7f6

Quantification of loading adjusted staining intensities is given in S3 Fig. Xenografts of both cell types show very low abundance of CII. CI, CIII and CIV showed a tendency towards increased protein levels in the CR-KD group of the SH-SY5Y cell line. CV protein levels of the SH-SY5Y tumors and CI of the SK-N-BE(2) tumors, did not mirror the respective enzymatic activities. This might reflect a low enzyme activity that is not linked to the protein stability of the analyzed subunit.  10.1371/journal.pone.0129802.g004Fig 4 Western blot analysis of subunits of of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes (CI-CV) from SH-SY5Y (A) and SK-N-BE(2) (B) xenografts.

Quantification of loading adjusted staining intensities is given in S3 Fig.  Immunohistochemical analysis of individual of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes (I-V) performed in the SH-SY5Y xenografts revealed a significant decrease in complex I staining in the CR-KD group when compared to the SD group (Fig 5; p<0.05).

31,results14,"  Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase 1 (Succinyl CoA 3 ketoacid coenzyme A transferase 1 (SCOT)) protein levels are low in NB xenografts Consistent with previous reports [47, 61, 62], Succinyl CoA 3 ketoacid coenzyme A transferase 1 (SCOT), the rate-limiting enzyme in ketone body utilization, showed very low to non-detectable protein levels in western blot analysis of NB xenografts, whereas Succinyl CoA 3 ketoacid coenzyme A transferase 1 (SCOT) is prominent in control kidney tissue. Succinyl CoA 3 ketoacid coenzyme A transferase 1 (SCOT) levels did not change in response to the shift in nutrient supply induced by the different dietary interventions (S4 Fig).

32,discussion0,"To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that targeting the metabolic phenotype of NB by dietary intervention can influence growth of this tumor entity. In the presented xenograft model KD and/or CR significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival. The observed effects support the results of tumor models of the central nervous system (CNS), where CR-KD showed inhibitory effects on tumor growth in the pre-clinical setting [31, 40–42]. Applying KD without CR would reduce the burden for patients undergoing adjuvant dietary therapy, and support clinical feasibility. Further studies are needed to extend the presented data.  In line with the more pronounced resistance of the SK-N-BE(2) cell line to standard treatment, xenografts also proved to be more resistant to KD in our xenograft model.",8f23de24-02ce-458a-a421-47d93be7f0e8
33,discussion1," We hypothesize that there are factors besides of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity that influence the sensitivity towards dietary intervention as SK-N-BE(2) xenografts show a tendency towards lower enzymatic activities. An explanation that might contribute to this observation is the proposed influence of the NMYC protein on increasing glutamine uptake and utilization as an alternative substrate [63]. Being well aware of the limitations of pre-clinical studies, we regard the proof of concept and validation of tumor metabolic parameters as an important step to trigger further research in this area. Although the presented model utilizes an immune-compromised host and a rather non-physiologic tumor location, we specifically chose this model to reduce additional influences and allow extensive evaluation of the mitochondrial phenotype of tumor tissue. These methods are in line with those of other KD mouse models [27, 64–66].",ce3d5626-eead-421b-af04-0944533743af
34,discussion2,"  Different mechanisms might contribute to the growth inhibitory potential of KD and/or CR on NB cancer cells observed in the presented model. A widely accepted theory is that the strong dependency on glycolysis for anabolic processes and energy production renders cancer cells susceptible to the decreased availability of glucose in hypovascularized tumor tissue [67–69]. In comparison with non malignant cells, cancer cells were shown to have reduced adaptability to the change in nutrient supply induced by KD and/or CR [31, 40–42]. Our data on the low Succinyl CoA 3 ketoacid coenzyme A transferase 1 (SCOT) expression in NB cells are in line with the reported inability of cancer cells to utilize ketone bodies as an energy source [61, 62]. Additionally ketone bodies might exert direct anti-proliferative effects in NB [47]. Results of KI67 and PHH3 staining suggest that reduced proliferation contributes to the observed tumor growth reduction in this model.",d9d1609d-3590-4113-b839-332993f2de5e
35,discussion3," As nutrient and energy depletion were shown to mediate cell cycle inhibition by LKB1-AMPK-pathway activation [70, 71] and mTOR-pathway inhibition [72, 73] these pathways constitute central targets for future investigations on the mechanisms of CR and/or KD. Besides reducing energy supply, glucose deprivation and KD was also correlated to thioredoxin redox system imbalance by reducing pentose phosphate pathway mediated NADPH production. This was linked to increased reactive oxygen species and toxicity in cancer cells [27, 74, 75]. Especially with regards to preclinical brain cancer models, also anti-angiogenic effects were reported [31, 32]. We are convinced that investigating the molecular mechanisms leading to growth inhibition of cancer cells in response to KD and/or CR will enhance our understanding of cancer cell biology and help to improve treatment strategies.",13662a39-534a-4f8b-b8a2-31aa5b1fc150
36,discussion4,"  Deficiency in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II activity is a well-described characteristic of familial paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas [76, 77]. Feichtinger et al. showed in 2010 that NB, another neural crest-derived tumor entity, shares this phenotype of distinctly low complex II activity. Although chromosomal region 1p36, where the complex II subunit-encoding SDHB gene maps, shows frequent loss of heterozygosity in NB, no mutation or epigenetic inactivation in any of the known complex II subunit-encoding genes has consistently been reported [3, 78, 79]. Additionally this low differentiated tumor entity shows a generalized low of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity [3]. In the present study, we demonstrated that cell line-derived NB xenografts exhibit a similar of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) phenotype as primary NB and might constitute a valuable resource for investigating the metabolic phenotype of NB.",b0e17cc8-75e9-4fda-af52-e4362362c531
37,discussion5, Complex II is the only subunit of the of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) chain entirely encoded by the nuclear genome and is not dependent on cellular mtDNA content. The low complex II activity therefore implies a downregulation or deficiency of nuclear encoded of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits independent of the low mtDNA content. Complex II is also the only enzyme directly linking the citric acid cycle with of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Future studies with this model might facilitate understanding of the regulation of mitochondrial of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex activity and expression in cancer cells.  The more generalized low mitochondrial of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity observed in NB corresponds to the low mtDNA copy number.,c152d499-b6e1-4a48-9c18-27934f0b0e39
38,discussion6," This state of low mtDNA content is shared by other predominantly glycolytic cell types such as neural stem cells and glioblastoma multiforme cancer cells and is suggested to be an important feature of low differentiation status [80, 81]. Compared to glioblastoma, however, downregulation of mtDNA in NB is even more pronounced (approximately 6-fold) [3, 45]. Upon inducing differentiation, neural stem cells were shown to undergo a concerted expansion of mtDNA copy number, resulting in an increase in respiratory capacity. In comparison, glioblastoma cells showed a significantly reduced capacity to do so [80]. These results imply a direct connection of of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity and mtDNA content to differentiation status and/or malignant phenotype. Besides their crucial role in cellular metabolism, mitochondria acceptedly serve central functions in the induction of apoptosis under physiological conditions and in cancer cells [82].",80827552-756f-4b40-8846-01d272e6f46e
39,discussion7," Most intriguingly the execution of this function was shown to be dependent on preserved of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in different model systems [83–85]. Both, depleting mtDNA and introducing mtDNA mutations via a cybrid-cell approach, were capable of mediating resistance to the induction of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis [83–86]. MtDNA content might therefore constitute a link between the low differentiation status and resistance to apoptosis. We showed in our xenograft model that NB tumors cannot adapt mitochondrial energy metabolism to the changes in nutrient supply induced with dietary intervention. This trait is supported by observations of sustained low of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity, mtDNA copy number evaluation and protein quantification, and was independent of NMYC status or chromosome 1p36 deletion. The molecular mechanisms underlying this low mtDNA phenotype of NB are still to be determined.",293c3363-ce7f-4e45-b00c-bf989a5c6f28
40,discussion8," In view of the pseudo-hypoxic state that is discussed for complex II-deficient cells, one might speculate that this phenotype causes a secondary downregulation of cellular mtDNA replication [87]. Interestingly in vitro experiments utilizing decanoic acid (C10), a medium chain fatty acid, have recently provided evidence for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ induced mitochondrial biogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells [88]. Since we did not observe this effect in our long chain fatty acid based KD it might be of interest to further evaluate the effects of MCT-based ketogenic diets on NB tumors.  One of the main advantages of KD over developing metabolism-targeting compounds is its ready accessibility for clinical evaluation and the lengthy past experience with clinical application in epilepsy [34]. Especially in the pediatric population, KD may represent a facile, at-hand, and tolerable adjunctive treatment strategy.",066108ac-b207-4f8a-9e03-d57d1ac77191
41,discussion9," In adult advanced-stage cancer patients, KD showed no major side effects [28, 30]. More extensive pre-clinical evaluation and strategies to introduce KD to NB cancer patients under controlled conditions will be mandatory to allow possible clinical application.  Conclusions Targeting the metabolism of cancer cells is an emerging strategy with the potential to improve currently insufficient treatment modalities. To do so we need to validate tumor models and improve characterization of native tissue with regard to cell metabolism. Here we showed that cell line-derived NB xenografts match the of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) parameters of patient-derived tumor tissue and are therefore a valuable tool for preclinical studies. Using this model, we demonstrated that CR and/or KD reduce NB tumor growth and that tumor cells do not express adaptive mechanisms regarding the of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system.",fcd2baa6-ed60-4a70-9967-a479217211e8
42,discussion10," Therefore, we propose that KD and/or CR should be further evaluated as a possible adjuvant therapy in patients undergoing treatment for NB.
