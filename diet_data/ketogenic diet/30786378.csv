0,methods0,"4.1. Animals and Dietary Procedure BTBR mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and a breeding colony has been maintained at the Health Sciences Animal Resource Center at University of Calgary. Detail animal protocol is presented in the schematic diagram (Figure 1A). The mice were born and reared in a quiet, temperature-controlled room and entrained to a 12-hour light-dark cycle. After weaning at postnatal day 21 (PD21), the mice were placed on either standard diet (SD) or ketogenic diet (KD; 6.3:1 ratio by weight of fat to carbohydrate plus protein; Bio-Serv F3666, Frenchtown, NJ, USA) for 10-14 days [73,74] based on our previous experiments [38,45]. F3666 is a ketogenic chow composed of lard, butter, corn oil, casein, cellulose, mineral mix, vitamin mix, and dextrose. This particular fomulation is rich in saturated fats [75]. Body weight was measured weekly the KD treatment (Figure 1).",3bf32a57-c073-4f32-a292-e4946e9bb0c0
1,methods1," After dietary intervention, whole blood was analyzed for glucose and circulating ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate) with Precision Xtra meters (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA) before animals were sacrificed. All experiments were performed around PD35. Only male mice were used. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Animal Care Committee and approved by the University of Calgary Animal Care Committee under the protocol AC17-0217.  4.2. Mitochondria Isolation and Protein Assay Total mitochondria were isolated using differential centrifugation, nitrogen disruption, and a Ficoll gradient as previously reported [76,77,78]. Mice were euthanized using isoflurane and rapidly decapitated in accordance with approved IACUC protocols. Following decapitation, the brain was removed and placed briefly in a beaker of ice-cold isolation buffer (215 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mM EGTA, and 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.2).",3d5ac9eb-13a9-45e4-8f3b-08a597906b46
2,methods2," Neo-cortical brain tissues were homogenized and then centrifuged at 1300× g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected in a fresh tube and centrifuged at 13,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 600 μL isolation buffer and placed in a nitrogen bomb at 1200 psi for 10 min at 4°C. The pressure in the nitrogen bomb was released, and then the sample was placed as the top layer on a Ficoll separation column, which consisted of a 10% Ficoll layer and a 7.5% Ficoll layer. The Ficoll column with sample was centrifuged at 32,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Following the Ficoll purification, the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer without EGTA and centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove residual Ficoll from the purified mitochondrial sample. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in an isolation buffer without EGTA to yield a final concentration of approximately 10 mg/mL and was stored immediately on ice.",bf2412ea-4453-4ab1-ab84-3139c2fccd8a
3,methods3," Protein concentration for a sample was determined using the BCA protein assay and measuring absorbance at 562 nm with a Synergy HT Plate Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The purity of the mitochondrial fraction was corroborated by Western blot with antibodies directed against calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CamKI, Abcam, 1:600), histone H3 (Abcam, 1:10,000), VDAC (Abcam, 1:5000), and cytochrome C (Santa Cruz, 1:300) (Supporting Information Figure S2).  4.3. Mitochondrial Bioenergetics Assay Using Seahorse XFe24 A Seahorse Bioscience XFe24 extracellular flux analyzer was used to measure mitochondrial function in cultured cells or intact isolated mitochondria. The day before an experiment, 1 mL of XF calibrant solution (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was added to each well of a 24-well dual-analyte sensor cartridge (Agilent). The cartridge was placed back on the 24-well calibration plate and put overnight in a 37°C incubator without CO2.",d53f9d0e-5737-4a00-a631-9dd85bec31ac
4,methods4," On the day of the experiment, injection ports on the sensor cartridge were loaded with specific mitochondrial substrates or inhibitors at 10× concentrations. Once loaded, the sensor cartridge was placed into the Seahorse XFe24 flux analyzer for automated calibration. The isolated mitochondria were diluted to the concentration required for plating (2.5 μg/50 μL) in respiration buffer (125 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (bovine serum albumin (BSA)) at pH 7.2) during calibration. Next, 50 μL of mitochondrial suspension was delivered to each well (except for background correction wells; A1, B3, C4, and D6) while the plate was on ice. The plate was then transferred to a centrifuge equipped with a swing bucket microplate adaptor, and was spun at 2000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, 450 μL of prewarmed respiration buffer at 37 °C was gently added to each well for a final volume of 500 μL per well at the beginning to the experiment.",bbba3a85-4d6e-4cee-aaa6-57d63b14a60c
5,methods5," Plates were then immediately placed into the calibrated analyzer for mitochondrial bioenergetics analysis. ADP/pyruvate/malate (4/5/2.5 mM), oligomycin (2 μg/mL), FCCP (4 μM), and antimycin A (2 μM) were injected sequentially through ports A–D, respectively.   4.4. Assay for Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain (electron transport chain (ETC)) Complex II Enzyme Activity electron transport chain (ETC) complex II enzyme activity was analyzed using an Abcam assay kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom; ab109908). The isolated mitochondria from the neo-cortical brain were used for complex II enzyme activity (100 μg proteins). The final colorless reaction product for complex II enzyme activity was monitored by measuring the decreases in absorbance at 600nm by the Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). To select the optimal amount for the activity assay, a dose-effect curve was plotted for the assay.  4.5.",3f453f60-d3c8-49a8-91cc-68b02e31b58f
6,methods6," Primary Cortical Mixed Cell Culture Primary cultures of cortical neuron and glial cells were prepared from whole cortices of PD0 BTBR or C57 mice. Cortices were dissected and dissociated with papain for 30 min, and then triturated with decreasing pore size pipettes. Cells were plated in growth media (33 mM glucose, 2 mM glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1X B27, 50 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin, and 4% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) on poly-D-lysine and laminin coated 12 mm coverslips and allowed to grow for 4 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2. At day 4, culture media was supplemented with the indicated concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) or vehicle control (H2O). After 24 h, culture media was aspirated, and the cells were gently washed with prewarmed 1X PBS and fixed in prewarmed 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37°C.",e2c77561-5d0b-4216-befa-daa1ce48cdbb
7,methods7," The fixative was subsequently aspirated, coverslips were washed 3 times with 1X PBS, quenched in 50 mM ammonium chloride for 15 min at room temperature and washed with 1X PBS.  4.6. Immunofluorescence Staining Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% TritonX100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed with 1X PBS, and blocked in 10% FBS in PBS for 30 min. The following primary antibodies were used at 1:1000, diluted in 5% FBS in PBS, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h: TOMM20 (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) and MAP2 (Signa-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). The appropriate secondary Alexa Fluor antibodies were diluted in 5% FBS in PBS at 1:1000, and cells were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. Stained cells were then washed in 1X PBS and mounted using Dako mounting media (Agilent; S3023).  4.7. Microscopy and Mitochondrial Morphology Analysis An Olympus spinning disc confocal system (Olympus SD OSR, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) (UAPON 100XOTIRF/1.",3f1bf4e0-bf4b-4b83-af4f-4bfdeb5964cd
8,methods8,"49 oil objective) operated by Metamorph software was used to image fixed neuronal cultures. Mitochondrial network morphology in primary cortical cultures was assessed in neurites (dendrites) of MAP2-positive neurons in a blinded fashion and assigned to 3 categories of mitochondrial morphology (fragmented, intermediate, and fused). At least 50 cells were counted per condition, and the analyses were performed on 3 independent replicates for each treatment condition.  4.8. Mitochondrial Number and Size Determination Using Transmission Electron Microscopy (Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)) Mitochondrial size and number were assessed from micrographs for three tissue slices obtained from each of the three C57 and three BTBR mice, for a total of 9 micrographs per group. The length of all complete mitochondria on individual Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) micrographs was estimated by standard cross-sectional interpolation [79].  4.9.",f06fb968-1bf0-42a6-adf3-56032fb8ecd8
9,methods9," Western Blots Depending on the target, 10–20-μg total protein was loaded onto Mini-PROTEAN® Precast Gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)) membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h. After blocking, the blots were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBS-T, the blots were incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS-T, blots were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)) detection system. Bands were detected and quantified using a ChemiDOC MP gel imaging system (Bio-Rad).",0ace919e-bb20-497a-816e-e3a5f318f82a
10,methods10," Antibodies against the Complex 1–5 cocktail (Abcam; 1:5000); DRP1 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA; 1:2000); pDRP1 at S616 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA; 1:1000); activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Cell Signaling; 1:500); pactivated protein kinase (AMPK) at T172 (Cell Signaling; 1:500); mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) (ProteinTech, Rosemont, IL, USA; 1:5000); pmitochondrial fission factor (MFF) at S146 (Cell Signaling; 1:1000); OPA1 (BD Biosciences; 1:5000); and MID51 (ProteinTech; 1:1000) were used. VDAC (Abcam; 1:5000) or actin (Cell Signaling; 1:10,000) was used as a loading control for all experiments. The expression levels of proteins were normalized to VDAC for mitochondria or to actin for tissue lysate, and the ratio of the phosphorylated and total forms was computed using the normalized relative expression levels.  4.10. Statistics The statistical analysis of the data was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (La Jolla, CA, USA).   All data are shown as mean ± SEM.",d1e70589-fe0a-4748-bc1d-caf0c9feb676
11,methods11," Trajectory data from four different groups (Figure 1B) were analyzed by repeated two-way ANOVA. The significant effects (main effects from two-way ANOVA) are presented as: ### p<0.001. To investigate the significant differences between groups in a single timepoint (in case of BW) or all other four groups analyzed by two-way ANOVA. The significant effects (main effects from two-way ANOVA) are presented as: ### p<0.001. The significant difference between groups analyzed by the post-hoc analysis, are presented as: *** p<0.001. In the case of two groups’ analysis, we have used a Student t-test (Figure 5A,B)  5. Conclusions Our results indicate evidence correlating mitochondrial dysfunction with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and improved mitochondrial function following treatment with the KD. We demonstrated that the KD improves mitochondrial function and uncovered potential pathways through which the KD may alter brain mitochondrial morphology in BTBR mice.",c1d32b90-e4a7-4de4-9656-ea3dba52783a
12,methods12," However, further investigation is required to understand the exact mechanism by which the KD may be improving mitochondrial morphology and function in BTBR mice.  While the KD is a readily available therapy, it is not without potentially significant side-effects [80]. In this regard, the fact that β-hydroxybutyrate alone was sufficient to promote hyperfused mitochondrial networks in primary neuronal cultures is exciting, as it suggests that the treatment with β-hydroxybutyrate alone (e.g., with ketone esters [81]), rather than the full KD, may be sufficient to improve mitochondrial function and Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms. Thus, understanding how the KD affects mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics is important in ultimately developing novel and improved therapeutic strategies for patients with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), especially those that mitigate the disabling core symptoms of the disorder.
