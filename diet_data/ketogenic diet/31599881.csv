0,introduction0,"Hypertension is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases and has been the most important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases worldwide [1], including stroke, heart failure, and aneurysm, etc. [2]. Therefore, finding ways to keep blood pressure under control is vital for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. As hypertension is one of the most important characteristics of metabolic syndrome, lifestyle interventions such as exercise, weight loss and reasonable dietary patterns are a standard and first-line way to manage and treat hypertension [3–5]. Ketogenic diet (KD), which is very low in carbohydrates and high in fats or protein, has been used as an approach to lose body weight and improve metabolic syndrome [6, 7]. However, besides the benefits, KD has been reported to induce some adverse effects such as hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia [8]. Our previous study also showed that KD leads to dyslipidemia [9, 10], which is a risk factor for the development of hypertension.",786cf0dd-8d12-4407-8d09-5baa1b00ec6f
1,introduction1," However, studies concerning on the potential effects of KD on cardiac remodeling are scare.  Cardiac remodeling, characterized by interstitial fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, is one of the most serious complications contributing to failing heart in hypertension [11]. Many pathological processes and signal pathways are involved in the development of cardiac remodeling in hypertension [12, 13]. Over the past years, strong evidence has suggested that the mammalian target of rapamyoin (mTOR) overactivation plays important roles in the fibrosis process, and suppressing mTOR is a target for preventing hypertension and its related fibrosis [14]. mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase belonging to PI3K ([phosphoinositide 3-kinase]-related kinase family), which could integrate energy, nutrient and growth factor signals to regulate cell proliferation, cell growth and inflammatory responses [15].",5c4016bc-fc59-49bc-9d04-86675ff381e0
2,introduction2," There are two different protein complexes of mTOR, namely complex1 (mTORC1) and complex 2 (mTORC2) [16] . The phosphorylation of their final downstream effector ribosomal protein S6 is the functional marker of mTORC1 kinase activity and the phosphorylation of Protein Kinase B (Akt) is the functional marker of mTORC2 [17]. Our previous study reported that ketogenic diet could activate the phosphorylation of Akt in diabetic mice, which indicates that KD may contribute to the activation of mTOR pathway and exert adverse effects on cardiac remodeling [9]. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effects of KD on cardiac remodeling and mTOR pathway in hypertensive rats. ",6cd0c42b-c3df-4d4d-adb1-1c89db9ba3c7

As expected, KD feeding significantly increased the β- hydroxybutyrate contents in hearts, suggesting that ketosis was reached in hearts by KD (Fig. 1a). Compared with age-matched Wistar rats, SHRs showed an increased systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)), which was further enhanced by KD feeding (Fig. 1b). However, diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) and heart rate were not markedly affected by KD treatment (Fig. 1c, d). Although KD feeding reduced the body weight of Wistar rats, the body weight between SHRs groups were comparable (Fig. 1e).

Moreover, the collagen expression was further increased by feeding KD (Fig. 2a–c). We also performed Masson’s trichrome stain to evaluate the interstitial fibrosis in heart. The results showed that the blue staining which represents fibrosis were significantly increased in hypertensive hearts by KD feeding (Figure D and E).

We thus measured the expression of NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4), which catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to reactive oxygen species, and the expression and activity of antioxidant enzyme SOD2. As expected, KD treatment significantly increased the expression of NOX4 (Fig. 3a, b) in SHRs.",86373b56-6188-474a-a6d3-5cf3aeb075da

16,results5,"01    Ketogenic diet enhances inflammatory responses in the heart of SHRs It is widely accepted that imynflammatory responses play a central role in provoking interstitial fibrosis, and ketogenic diet could exert various effects on inflammation in different tissues [22]. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of KD on the expression of inflammatory markers in the heart of SHRs. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) contributes to the infiltration of monocytes, memory T cells and dendritic cells into injury tissues and produces inflammatory factors. Compared with WT rats, the expression of MCP-1 and TNFα was significantly increased in the heart of SHRs and KD feeding further promoted the expression of MCP-1 and TNFα (Fig. 4a–c). KD also increased neutrophil (myeloperoxidase (MPO)+) (Fig. 4d–e) and macrophage (CD68+) (Fig. 4f, g) infiltration in hearts of hypertensive rats as well as the transcription of IL-1β, TNFα and IFN-γ in hearts (Additional file 1: Figure S1).",97e08ff5-5311-4533-9833-d4f2cb8be1fa

The ratio of phospho (p)S6S235/S6 is the functional marker of mTORC1 kinase activity and the ratio of p-AktS473/Akt is the functional marker of mTORC2 kinase activity. We can conclude that both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity were comparable between normal and hypertensive hearts, and that KD treatment didn’t affect the activity of mTORC1, however increased the activity of mTORC2 in the heart of both WT and SHRs (Fig. 5c, d).

19,results8,"01    β-hydroxybutyrate strengthens the progression of TGF-β-induced fibrosis via mTOR pathway in isolated cardiac fibroblasts β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) is an endogenic metabolite that is synthesized in the liver from fat, and it circulates throughout the body for energy supply [24]. Our data showed KD enhanced the ketone body β-OHB content in hearts (Fig. 1a). To further verify our hypothesis, we further investigated whether β-OHB could activate mTORC2 in cardiac fibroblasts. It was found that the ketone body β-OHB treatment for 24 hours didn’t induce the activation of mTORC1 or mTORC2 (Fig. 6a–c). And the expression of collagen was not affected by KD feeding, suggesting that β-OHB alone can’t activate mTOR or contribute to the fibrogenesis in cardiac fibroblasts. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a central mediator of cardiac fibrosis and plays a vital role in hypertensive cardiac remodeling [11].",3263e19b-19dc-4107-9725-8f15c0afe882
20,results9," To mimic the in vivo environment, we exposed fibroblasts to β-hydroxybutyrate and TGF-β co-stimulation. It was shown that β-OHB and TGF-β co-treatment didn’t affect the ratio of p-S6/S6 (Fig. 6b), but significantly increased the ratio of p-Akt/Akt (Fig. 6c), suggesting an increased activity of mTORC2. Similarly, the expression of collagen 1 and collagen 3 were also increased in cardiac fibroblasts exposed to co-stimulation by β-hydroxybutyrate and TGF-β (Fig. 6d, e). More importantly, these effects were almost eliminated by mTOR inhibition with Temsirolimus (Figure F–H). In addition, proliferation is another feature of activated cardiac fibroblasts. β-OHB alone didn’t induce the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts. TGF-β could increases cell viability but this effect couldn’t be blunted by mTORC inhibitor (Fig. 6I).",ebcee110-d9be-4a9c-b234-38c99c1a8fac

22,discussion0,"Historically, dietary strategies that restrict carbohydrate have been used for weight loss. Multiple studies have outlined the successful use of the ketogenic diet in obesity through an increase in satiety. Ketone bodies are the major source of energy in the periods of fasting and/or carbohydrate shortage and play a role in appetite suppressant through actions on specific hypothalamic neurons and increasing the release of leptin [25, 26]. In addition, reduced carbohydrate intake results in decreased insulin levels and blood glucose concentrations, which has been hypothesized to produce metabolic benefits [27, 28]. However, there are contradictory data about KD. Despite their beneficial effects on weight loss, metabolic diseases and epileptic seizures, it has been recently demonstrated that a long-term KD treatment caused hepatic steatosis, a pro-inflammatory state, pancreatitis and in patients [29].",a6693f70-6b73-4b74-a820-de87e162bedb
23,discussion1," Our previous study also showed that ketogenic diet might lead to dyslipidemia [9], which is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease and one of the main characteristics of metabolic syndrome. However, the potential role of ketogenic diet in hypertension has received scarce attention.  Here, it was shown that 4 weeks of KD feeding contributed to interstitial fibrosis and aggravated cardiac remodeling in SHRs. In addition, as an endogenic metabolite of KD, β-OHB strengthened the progression of TGF-β-induced fibrosis in cardiac fibroblasts. Inhibition of mTOR pathway almost reversed these effects, suggesting that ketone body might contribute to cardiac fibroblasts via mTOR pathway in hypertension. These data suggested that ketogenic diet may lead to negative effects on hypertension, which underscores the necessity to fully evaluate its reliability before using it for people who are suffering from hypertension.",1f59df64-e0ef-4cce-8767-3c05a7816622
24,discussion2,"  The pathogenesis of hypertension-related cardiac remodeling is very complex and its underlying mechanisms remain to be further elucidated. However, oxidative stress and inflammatory responses have been confirmed to be involved in the progress of cardiac remodeling [30–32]. Accordingly, our previous study also suggested that mitochondria dysfunction and increased oxidative damage were associated with cardiac remodeling in TAC mice [33]. Here, we examined the effects of KD on oxidative stress and inflammation in SHRs. Our data showed that inflammation and oxidative stress were increased in hypertensive heart, and KD further enhanced these adverse effects, which may be responsible for the aggravated cardiac remodeling in SHRs receiving KD feeding.  AMPK-mTOR pathway has been noticed by people in the physiological process of hypertension and cardiac remodeling [34, 35]. AMPK, as the upstream molecules of mTOR, can inhibit the activity of mTOR.",bd343e9c-3ddc-41ca-b316-b39276b060e8
25,discussion3," Actually, the effect of the ketogenic diet on AMPK-mTOR activity is of tissue specific effects and affected by leptin and insulin [36]. AMPK activity increased in the liver and adipose tissue but decreased in the hypothalamus and heart. In the present study, we also observed a decreased AMPK activity in KD-treated SHRs, which is in line with previous study [37]. It has been found that mTOR play roles both in oxidative stress and inflammatory responses [14]. In our present study, we found that KD increased the activity of mTORC2 but didn’t affect the activity of mTORC1, which indicated that KD may contribute to oxidative and inflammation via activating mTORC2. In accordance with this, previous studies reported that increased levels of PI3K/Akt/mTOR were found in the kidney of a rat model with DOCA-salt-induced hypertension, and inhibition of mTORC2 completely prevented salt-induced hypertension in rats [17, 38].",1382a139-96c1-4b29-93b2-4e435d9f33b4
26,discussion4," These studies, combined with ours, all indicated that mTORC2 may play an important role in cardiac remodeling and hypertension.  Excessive cardiac fibrosis is a major reason for cardiac remodeling. The activation and excessive proliferation of cardiac fibroblast is the major reason for cardiac fibrosis [39]. It is important to figure out whether KD-mediated mTOR activation can contribute to the pro-fibrotic effects of cardiac fibroblast. Interestingly, we found β-OHB alone couldn’t activate the mTORC2, thereby unable to induce increased expression of collagen in cardiac fibroblasts. Given that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is the main initiator of fibrosis in hypertensive situation in vivo, we next exposed cardiac fibroblasts to β-OHB and TGF-β co-stimuli. The results showed that β-OHB enhanced TGF-β-induced activation of mTORC2 and expression of collagen in cardiac fibroblasts.",5934506e-d948-422b-bf5e-db93a67763d3
27,discussion5," In addition, inhibition of mTOR completely prevented the increased expression of collagen in cardiac fibroblasts. These data suggest that ketogenic diet may only contribute to pro-fibrotic actions via mTOR pathway in hypertensive situation, which is in line with the result of our previous study that KD didn’t induce fibrosis in diabetic mice (Fig. 2). And another study also reported that KD strengthen the fibrogenic response in hepatic stellate cells via TGF-β [40], but the mechanisms underlying how β-OHB stimulates TGF-β still deserves further study.  There are some limitations needed to be pointed out in this study. First, because no selective inhibitor is available yet, we chose Temsirolimus, which inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2, for our experiments in vitro. Thus, we can’t exclude the effects of mTORC1 on the activation of cardiac fibroblasts. Second, we only investigated the pro-fibrotic mechanisms of ketogenic diet in vitro, but the effects in vivo still deserve further study.",74e6a2e9-e23f-49e6-aaa5-63b064cd31f3
