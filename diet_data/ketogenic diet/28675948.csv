0,methods0,"4.1. Reagents, Cell Lines, and Culture Conditions 2-DG was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany). LNT-229 cells were a kind gift of Dr. N de Tribolet (Lausanne, Switzerland) [37] and were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM)) (4.5 g/L corresponding to 24.975 mM glucose) containing 10% foetal calf serum (foetal calf serum (FCS)) (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator (Binder, Tuttlingen, Germany) under a CO2 atmosphere (5%). The experiments were performed in serum free Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM), with 2 mM of glucose and an incubation time of 6 h.  4.2. Measurement of Glucose and Lactate The cell-free supernatant was collected and the glucose and lactate concentrations were measured using the biochemistry analyzer Hitachi 917 [37].  4.3.",236ae92d-6b9f-4cbb-84ca-550a511228ba
1,methods1," Lysate Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis The procedure was performed, as previously described, following a standard immunoblotting protocol [38]. After incubation, the LNT-229 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) and pelleted. The lysates were prepared using a lysis buffer, P, with the addition of 1% Halt™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Single-Use Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hamburg, Germany), diluted in a Laemmli buffer and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. Subsequently, the proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 µm; GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK).",c5c9e0ad-2bd7-4251-867a-a1eb9b85369c
2,methods2," The membranes were probed with antibodies to phosphorylated (p)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Thr172) (1:1000; #2531 Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), p-acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) (Ser79) (1:1000; #3661 Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and actin (#sc-1616, 1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The secondary anti-rabbit and anti-goat antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for detection [37].  4.4. Animals Six-week-old female athymic nude Foxn1nu mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were used in all of the animal experiments. The local regulations were observed and approval was obtained from the local governmental authorities (Regierungspräsidium Darmstadt, approval number FK/1038).  4.5. Dietary Interventions All of the animal work was performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and institutional standards.",60aad69b-b3b4-4721-b488-0399785e339e
3,methods3," The mice were maintained in groups of a maximum four animals per cage, in a pathogen-free environment. On day 0 of the experiment, the animals were randomized into two diet groups, a SD rich in carbohydrates versus an isocaloric KD. The SD contained 45% carbohydrates, 41% protein, and 14% fat (ssniff Spezialdiäten GmbH, Soest, Germany). The KD was KetoCal 4:1, baked as cookies (Nutricia GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). The content of the diets has been described before [21].  4.6. Ketone Body and Glucose Measurement Ketosis was measured at least once a week with Precision Xceed, test strip FreeStyle Precision Beta-Ketone (Abbott Diabetes Care Ltd., Witney, UK), starting one week after the randomization. The blood glucose level was measured using Accu-Check Performa, test strip Accu-Check Inform II (Roche).  4.7. Behavioral Assessment The behavior was assessed semi-quantitatively, as established by a research group of our facility [23].",98cac4aa-9d2d-456c-943f-ebc554f3d6fa
4,methods4," The mice were placed in an experimental setting for one minute and a video was recorded for later analysis. The mice had not been trained before.  Beam walking test: We placed the mice carefully on a bar of wood (6 mm diameter, 50 cm length), 20 cm above the ground, until they attained a firm grip. The following score was used: score 1—mouse is heavily sedated and cannot hold onto bar; Score 2—mouse is sedated, can hold onto bar for one minute but does not move; Score 3—mouse explores on bar but appears lightly sedated and does not reach the end of the beam; and Score 4—mouse moves freely on bar and reaches the end of the bar.  Spontaneous motion activity: The mice were placed in the middle of a transparent cube of 30 cm side length.",4d6ffab8-416a-4231-950a-541f250a1133
5,methods5," The following score was used: 1—mouse is heavily sedated and does not move; 2—mouse is sedated, shows little exploration on the spot but does not move into any direction; 3—mouse explores the cube, appears lightly sedated and typically does not reach the boundary of the cube; and 4—mouse moves freely in the cube and reaches a boundary at least once.  4.8. Statistical Analyses T-test and chi squared test were performed in Microsoft Excel for statistical analysis. ",4638b5a0-2393-476a-ba5a-b941940b08b2
