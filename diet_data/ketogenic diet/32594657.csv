0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Participants  This was a prospective, two-center study of pre-menopausal women with a history of drug-resistant epilepsy on modified Atkins diet (MAD) for at least 3 months who had a catamenial seizure pattern defined by Herzog criteria [11]. The study was conducted to determine if adding an medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-based medical food product (betaquik®, Vitaflo International Ltd., Liverpool, UK) was feasible and well-tolerated.  Catamenial seizure patterns were determined by analyzing calendars where women annotated dates and quantity of seizures and menses onset. The presence or absence of a catamenial pattern was determined by calculating a ratio based on average daily seizure frequency during the target phase compared to the others. The ratios used in this study were previously validated [11].  The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins and University of Wisconsin-Madison Institutional Review Boards and reported in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02426047).",d4945e84-d115-43a8-a239-2450f7945769
1,methods1," Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or a legally authorized representative. Participants were seen at the Johns Hopkins Hospital Adult Diet Epilepsy Center (AEDC) or UW Adult Epilepsy Dietary Therapy Clinic (AEDTC) between March 2015 and December 2019.  Inclusion criteria were pre-menopausal women, age ≥18 years, already adherent on a 20-g net carbohydrate per day limit modified Atkins diet (MAD) [18] for at least 3 months, determined to have an established catamenial seizure pattern (by Herzog criteria [11]) during at least 2 of the past 3 months.  Exclusion criteria included men; being unwilling to restrict carbohydrates; significantly underweight (BMI ≤ 18.",77e83b81-3341-4795-a357-8460efecd4fa

3,methods3," Study Procedures  Women who qualified were consented and enrolled during a routine follow-up outpatient clinic appointment. Participants were counseled to leave all antiseizure drugs and hormonal contraceptives unchanged throughout the 6-month study unless medically necessary and to inform the study team immediately of any changes, plans to become pregnant, or discovered pregnancy.  During a 1-month baseline period, participants were asked to keep a seizure and menstrual cycle calendar; check and record daily urine ketones and weekly weight; and complete a baseline 3-day food record. To evaluate for ovulatory cycles, during the baseline month, a progesterone level was drawn on day 22–24 of the menstrual cycle (with day 1 = first day of menses) and ideally within 3–11 days of the start of the next menstrual cycle. Participants who were not ovulating were still included in the study since women with irregular menses and anovulatory cycles can also have catamenial seizure patterns.",54daaafa-d793-4def-b8bf-49f83ca17f65
4,methods4,"  After the 1-month baseline interval, study participants remained on modified Atkins diet (MAD) and added betaquik® for 10 days per month for the final 5 months of the 6-month study. Study participants were contacted each month and given specific instructions for which 10-day period to consume betaquik®. They were asked to note on provided calendars which days they consumed it and if there were any days they missed for any reason. To introduce the intervention gradually and avoid intolerance, participants were instructed to consume ¼ carton (62 mL, 12.5 g of medium chain triglyceride (MCT) fat) of betaquik® on the first day and ½ carton (125 mL, 25 g of medium chain triglyceride (MCT) fat) for the remaining 9 days. The exact days to consume betaquik® were determined by the individual catamenial seizure pattern when reviewing the seizure calendar from the month prior. The required amount of betaquik® could be consumed on the target days in any manner (i.e.",fde4c3e8-29ed-4d6b-8914-a9d378a4e36f
5,methods5,", drink all at once or smaller amounts throughout the day). They were also given sample recipes for using betaquik® if they chose to consume it with food. A 24-h food record was obtained via phone by the dietitian during one of the days they consumed betaquik® each month.  Participants were provided test strips to measure urine ketones (acetoacetate) and were also asked to check and record ketones daily during the baseline month, during the 10 days they took betaquik®, and twice weekly for the rest of the month. Ketones were recorded as: negative, trace (5 mg/dL), small (15 mg/dL), moderate (40 mg/dL), large (80 mg/dL) or large plus (160 mg/dL).  Outpatient clinic visits occurred at enrollment and at the 3-month and 6-month time point during the study. At these visits, the participants met with both the site principal investigator and ketogenic dietitian. Basic anthropometrics, including height and weight, were recorded at each visit.",00dad124-20b1-4841-aaef-9fb34c882cea
6,methods6," Tolerance and menstrual cycle surveys were filled out at each visit as well. A pre-betaquik® survey asked participants to rate the convenience, ease of use, and taste of foods consumed on modified Atkins diet (MAD), and to report any symptoms they attributed to modified Atkins diet (MAD). An on-betaquik® survey asked participants to rate the convenience, ease of use, and taste of the betaquik® added to modified Atkins diet (MAD) and to report any symptoms they believed were due to modified Atkins diet (MAD) or betaquik®. Symptoms queried were abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hunger, problems with texture/mouthfeel, problems with taste, and there was also a space to include unsolicited symptoms.  Participants exited the trial if they withdrew from the study for any reason.",3c9dc9f4-b389-4417-b19f-407f90764f5e
7,methods7," Participants were considered study failures if they did not complete the 10-day per month use of betaquik® for at least 2 of the 5 months or if they did not adhere to the 20-g of net carbohydrates per day modified Atkins diet (MAD). When the study reached completion, participants could elect to continue use of betaquik® if desired or to replace betaquik® with an equivalent dose of commercial medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, if preferred.  2.3. Outcome Measures  The primary outcome measure was adherence with betaquik® compared to published adherence with modified Atkins diet (MAD) and medium chain triglyceride diets to demonstrate feasibility. Adherence was measured by the percent of time the participant drank betaquik® as instructed (participants were instructed to take it for 10 days per month and annotate when taken on the calendar). The participant was defined as adherent if they drank the required amount (either ¼ or ½ carton) on more than 80% of the prescribed days.",d5000980-c201-4bc6-91a6-d53e924e58a0
8,methods8,"  A secondary outcome measure was tolerability of betaquik® based on a 10-point tolerance scale. Tolerance was measured by surveys given to the participants before and after starting betaquik®.  2.4. Power Analysis  Prior studies of modified Atkins diet (MAD) [23,24,25] and medium chain triglyceride diets [26] have shown an approximately 55–60% adherence rate at 3–8 months (either reported as such or calculated using the number of participants who dropped out of the study). To be included in the study, participants needed to demonstrate adherence on modified Atkins diet (MAD) prior to enrollment. We hypothesized that modified Atkins diet (MAD) plus betaquik® would lead to an 85% adherence rate compared to a 55% adherence rate of a modified Atkins diet (MAD) or medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet alone. Based on this, we calculated a sample size of 19 to achieve 80% power and an alpha level of 0.05.",e114ee37-38c0-483a-b74d-a3c648f3cf89
9,methods9," Our goal enrollment was 20 participants, taking into account potential attrition and protocol violations.  2.5. Statistical Analysis  Descriptive statistics were used to present baseline characteristics. Proportions were calculated for all categorical variables and means or medians, standard deviations, and ranges were calculated for all continuous variables. Differences between participant ratings for modified Atkins diet (MAD) and modified Atkins diet (MAD) plus the intervention were assessed using a paired samples t-test.  3. Results  3.1. Participant Demographics  Between March 2015 and May 2019, 16 women aged 20–50 years (mean 32, SD 8.0) who were already on modified Atkins diet (MAD) for at least 3 months through the Johns Hopkins Adult Diet Epilepsy Center (AEDC) or UW Health Adult Epilepsy Dietary Therapy Clinic (AEDTC) were enrolled (Table 1). Age of seizure onset ranged from 1–41 years (mean 10.9, SD 10.8).",20f0683d-5ccf-478c-8dbb-b4241efe1e7d
10,methods10," Duration of modified Atkins diet (MAD) use prior to study enrollment ranged from 0.5–6 years (mean 1.9, SD 1.7).  Of the 16 participants who enrolled, 13 (81%) completed the study. Three participants dropped out, two of these were due to gastrointestinal (GI) side effects deemed likely related to the study intervention, betaquik®. A third participant had both GI side effects and missed menses after the first month of the study. The reported GI side effects included nausea and abdominal pain, and none required medical attention. The participants who dropped out were older with an average age of 42.7 years, compared to the average age of participants who completed the study at 30.6 years.  3.2. Catamenial Pattern  Women with a C1 (perimenstrual), C2 (periovulatory) or C3 (luteal) pattern for at least 2 of the prior 3 months while on Ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) were invited to enroll in the study. At baseline, n = 15 (93.",edd62d71-5225-41f2-a94f-b2e5846211ac
11,methods11,"8%) had primarily a C3 catamenial pattern (some women had more than one pattern). During the intervention months, the majority (75%) of participants had 1 or more months where there were seizures, but without a catamenial pattern, and n = 3 of the 13 (23.1%) who completed the study had no catamenial pattern for the last 2 months of the study. A total of n = 6 (37.5%) had at least 1 month with no seizures during the study.  Fourteen participants obtained a serum progesterone level (one was never obtained and one had the incorrect laboratory study measured), and the mean level was 8.0 ng/mL, range 0.6–17.1 ng/mL, SD 4.6 ng/mL. Of the 14 participants, only 5 (35.7%) had a value of 10 ng/mL or above, which is an indicator of ovulation. The average number of days to the next menstrual cycle was 7 days, with a range of 3–13 days. Two of the 14 participants had progesterone levels measured outside the ideal 3–11 day window prior to menses onset.",ccbefaba-765f-4e60-aa62-09db7641fdb9
12,methods12," As noted above, a majority of women in the study had C3 catamenial pattern, where seizures are increased during the entire luteal phase in anovulatory cycles, which typically results in irregular menses.  3.3. Ketones  At month 1 (baseline—no intervention), n = 6 (37.5%) of participants recorded ketones as requested, while n = 5 (31.3%) recorded ketones once or more, but not per protocol with the full data requested. During month 2 (first month with the addition of betaquik®), n = 12 (75%) recorded ketones and n = 3 (18.8%) recorded ketones once or more, but not per protocol. During month 5 when 13 participants remained, n = 9 (69.2%) recorded ketones and n = 3 (23.1%) recorded ketones once or more, but not per protocol.",0cbf0e02-273d-423e-9116-8733a9d7616f
13,methods13,"  During months with enough ketone data available to analyze, levels of each participant were evaluated to determine whether urine ketone values were similar, higher, or lower during the 10-day timeframe betaquik® was added to Ketogenic diet therapy (KDT), compared to the rest of the month. Average ketone levels were never lower during the betaquik® days. Evaluating across the entire study, n = 11 (68.8%) of all participants had higher ketones during at least one of the 5 months betaquik® was consumed, and n = 5 (31.3%) had higher ketones levels for at least 3 of the 5 months.  3.4. Seizures  This study was not designed to evaluate efficacy of betaquik® as a primary outcome. However, the baseline (non-intervention) month was compared with the 5 months the participants received the intervention. Of the 16 participants, n = 6 (37.",94c2de83-cef3-444b-8f79-e299953f0df6
14,methods14,"5%) had at least one of the 5 months during the betaquik® intervention with no seizures, although two of these participants also had no seizures during their baseline modified Atkins diet (MAD) only month (in addition to at least one other month during the intervention). There were n = 7 (43.7%) who had fewer seizures on average, including n = 4 (25%) with a 50% or greater seizure reduction, during the intervention months compared to the baseline month. One participant had six seizures during the baseline month and six total seizures during the 5 intervention months combined.  3.5. Adherence  Of the 13 participants who completed the study, there was 100% adherence (consuming the required amount of betaquik® on more than 80% of the prescribed days.) Of the 3 participants who dropped out of the study, there was also 100% adherence until the point of study exit. The overall intervention adherence rate through study completion was 81.2%.  3.6.",b1df4fb7-76e4-4611-8b01-5b2ebd06ecaf
15,methods15," Tolerance  Participants were asked to rate the convenience, ease of use, and taste of modified Atkins diet (MAD) (at enrollment) and modified Atkins diet (MAD) + betaquik® (3-month and 6-month time points) on a 10-point Likert scale (Table 2). There was no significant difference in ease of use or taste between time points. There was a significant increase in the convenience rating at both the 3-month and 6-month time points (modified Atkins diet (MAD) + betaquik®) compared to baseline (modified Atkins diet (MAD) only).  Participants were asked to indicate if they experienced any symptoms that they attributed to modified Atkins diet (MAD) (at baseline and at the 3- and 6-month time points) or to betaquik® (at the 3- and 6-month time points). At the 3-month time point, there were 14 surveys completed due to one participant dropping out and one not completing the 3-month survey. At the 6-month time point there were 13 due to the 3 who dropped out.",246b4297-6571-4df4-b68c-111bdee990cb
16,methods16," Table 3 shows the number of participants reporting each symptom, including additional symptoms they self-reported. The only symptoms that were significantly different between modified Atkins diet (MAD) and betaquik® were abdominal pain occurring more often with betaquik® at the 3-month time point and nausea occurring more often with betaquik® at the 6-month time point. Note that participants who dropped out prior to each time point did not complete the 3- and/or 6-month surveys, and all participants who dropped out reported gastrointestinal symptoms. Fewer symptoms were reported for both modified Atkins diet (MAD) and betaquik® at the 6-month time point compared to the 3-month time point. There was 1 less participant at the 6-month time point, but even if the symptoms they reported at 3-months were added to the 6-month time point, there would be a total of 23 symptoms reported at 3-months and 18 at 6-months.  4.",70eb3eb7-fc6a-4fd1-b68b-76c1419464c6
17,methods17," Discussion  There was 100% adherence for consuming betaquik® added to modified Atkins diet (MAD) for 10 days each month in the 13 participants who completed study, and also in the three participants who dropped out. The overall intervention adherence rate (considering the three participants that dropped out) through study completion was 81.2%. This rate of adherence to betaquik® is better than reported for modified Atkins diet (MAD) alone in comparable studies over 6 months, although all participants in this study were pre-screened for modified Atkins diet (MAD) adherence and were motivated to try an intervention for additional seizure reduction, which may account for this finding. Monthly contact with participants and knowing they would be contacted for a food recall every month was likely motivating and helped with adherence. Rates may be lower if patients are not monitored as closely.",95c94eb7-97db-4c24-8162-86ee13c9dd72
18,methods18,"  Participants reported that betaquik® added to modified Atkins diet (MAD) was more convenient and easy to use compared to modified Atkins diet (MAD) alone. This is somewhat surprising as it was an additional intervention they needed to incorporate for 10 days per month, but is a reflection of the general ease of taking the product. Participants did not like the taste of betaquik® compared to modified Atkins diet (MAD) alone, but this difference was not significant.  Overall tolerance of betaquik® compared to modified Atkins diet (MAD) was very good, although 3 of 16 study participants dropped out due to gastrointestinal side effects that were not present prior to initiating the intervention. The most common side effects attributed to modified Atkins diet (MAD) alone were constipation and nausea, whereas the most common side effects attributed to betaquik® were abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea.",8d47313a-ab41-4ef4-bbd3-e7d717338a77
19,methods19," An attempt was made to ease side effects and improve tolerability by having participants consume a smaller amount on the first of 10 days, and they also had the option of spreading their total consumption throughout each day instead of consuming it all at once. In the future, starting with even smaller amounts may help with tolerance or consistently using a small amount daily and increasing during the 10-day catamenial period. Additionally, customized instructions (i.e., amount and frequency) could be provided based on an individual’s prior experience with medium chain triglyceride (MCT) products. For example, if a participant previously tried medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil as a ketogenic supplement and had GI side effects, starting with a lower dose over a longer titration period and/or implementing a slower titration during the 10 days and/or consuming over divided doses throughout the day may help ease or prevent side effects.",8cf88c26-a899-4c6d-a344-ad5577107369
20,methods20," The 10-day timeframe for the intervention was chosen as standard duration to target catamenial seizure patterns, but the timeframe could be extended to allow for titration. Participants may have become more accustomed to medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil over time, and this is reflected in the symptom survey, which showed fewer symptoms reported for betaquik® at the 6-month time point compared to the 3-month time point, even when taking into consideration symptoms reported by participants who dropped out of the study.  Interestingly, 94% of study participants primarily had a C3 (luteal phase of the menstrual cycle) catamenial pattern. This finding was consistent with progesterone levels, which were suggestive of anovulation for 64% of the participants. The C3 catamenial seizure pattern can be particularly difficult to treat because there are typically anovulatory cycles with irregular (and thus difficult to predict) menses and cycle lengths.",95891c66-6ca7-4428-9506-c0fe4bb931fe
21,methods21," For example, it is very difficult to accurately time an intervention for a woman with increased seizures 1 week prior to menses if menses are irregular. This was a challenge during the present study because a 10-day time frame that would have captured the time of increased seizures prior to menses for 1 month may not have correlated to the same phase of the cycle during the next month. In some cases, a different 10-day window had to be provided each month (i.e., we were not always able to say “start consuming betaquik® on day 10 of menses every month”). Outside the context of a research study, determining the exact timing for multiple patients would be difficult to coordinate in a busy clinical practice. Further studies are needed to determine whether the C3 catamenial pattern is seen more often in women on modified Atkins diet (MAD) and if modified Atkins diet (MAD) itself could be contributing to anovulatory cycles, irregular menses, and lower than expected progesterone levels.",0693dc01-c1c9-4c17-a457-342c081599bf
22,methods22,"  Although the catamenial seizure pattern did not typically change to a different catamenial pattern from month to month, 75% of participants had some months during the intervention where there were seizures but no identified catamenial pattern. Notably, 37.5% had at least one intervention month with no seizures. Overall, 43.7% had reduced seizures, including 25% with a 50% or greater seizure reduction, during the intervention months compared to the baseline month. One participant had six seizures during the baseline month and six total seizures during the 5 intervention months combined.  Most women did not consistently record their ketone levels during the study, despite being provided with urine ketone test strips. This is not necessarily surprising because it can be a challenge for patients on modified Atkins diet (MAD) seen in the Adult Diet Epilepsy Center (AEDC) and Adult Epilepsy Dietary Therapy Clinic (AEDTC) to consistently monitor, record, and self-report ketone levels.",acdacad1-73e6-4218-b8cf-7e1c6d9335bb
23,methods23," In this study, participants were asked to record ketone levels more often than typically requested in clinical practice. However, for participants who did record ketones, 68.8% had higher ketones compared during the 10-day window on 1 or more of the months betaquik® was used, compared to the baseline month. The goal of using betaquik® is to boost ketone body production by increasing medium chain triglyceride (MCT) fat intake (25 g for 9 of the 10 intervention days), which may result in higher than baseline ketones or maintaining ketone levels during times when the ketone levels may be lower. For example, some women note a trend towards lower ketones during menses compared to the rest of the month.  Limitations of the study included its small sample size and that the enrollment goal was not met. Recruitment for the study proved more challenging than anticipated.",34057c3c-3165-4ff0-81a5-6b8b2ea24fd8
24,methods24," All women who qualified for the study chose to enter the study, but finding women on modified Atkins diet (MAD) who met all of the enrollment criteria was challenging. Of note, in our clinical experience, many women self-report catamenial seizure patterns even if no consistent patterns are identified on calendar review. In addition, some women who reported catamenial seizure patterns in clinic were not able to provide seizure and menstrual cycle data for the minimum three full menstrual cycles that needed to be analyzed to determine if there is a catamenial pattern.  Future considerations include a larger clinical trial to evaluate interventions and strategies for catamenial seizure patterns in women on Ketogenic diet therapy (KDT)s. The adherence rate and tolerability of betaquik® shows feasibility for future studies. There is a great need to develop better treatments for catamenial epilepsy in general, but in particular for women with a C3 catamenial pattern.",19fcfcb5-aa5c-4b30-9b2e-d0cf64df8d0c
25,methods25, A future study could evaluate whether consuming betaquik® (or equivalent) consistently (instead of for 10 days per month) would be most effective in eliminating seizures in a C3 pattern. ,d3689218-1388-48c7-968e-93983e0aa852
