0,background0,"Glioblastoma multiforme (Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)) is a highly aggressive, heterogeneous brain tumor with poor prognosis [1]. Standard of care includes surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy, however median survival is about 15 months with a two-year survival of 30 % and a 5-year survival of <5 % in adults [2]. Despite breakthroughs in our understanding of the disease, therapeutic options available for Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have remained largely unchanged over the past three decades. This has led to only marginal increases in overall patient survival and new therapeutic approaches to enhance brain tumor treatment are warranted.  One novel therapeutic approach for Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) involves targeting a phenotypic trait shared by virtually all cancer cells, deregulated metabolism. It has been postulated that metabolic alteration such as that seen with the therapeutic ketogenic diet (KD) may be an effective anti-cancer strategy [3].",09da4097-d97c-450f-bbcb-1da1c8ee5a71
1,background1," The KD is a high fat, low-carbohydrate/adequate protein nutritional therapy used in the treatment of refractory epilepsy [4]. We and others have shown that the KD enhances survival in mouse models of malignant glioma [5–8]. We also demonstrated that the KD greatly enhanced survival when administered in combination with radiation [6]. Mechanistically, the KD alters a variety of processes that influence the tumor microenvironment including hypoxia, inflammation, angiogenesis and vascular permeability [5, 9]. However, the effect of a KD on the Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumor-reactive immune response has yet to be examined.  We have recently shown that an unrestricted KD decreases expression of the hypoxia marker carbonic anhydrase IX (carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)) and the key mediator of the hypoxic response hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-1α) in a mouse model of malignant glioma [9].

2,background2," demonstrated that hypoxia leads to inhibition of T cell proliferation and effector responses, with induction of CD4 + FoxP3+ T regulatory cells in Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [10]. This study also demonstrated that this immunosuppressive effect could be reversed by inhibiting HIF-1α. As tumor hypoxia is linked to the less favorable Th2 immune response [11], it is possible that by altering the hypoxic response the KD may promote a Th1 type tumor-reactive immune response. Additionally, we previously demonstrated that the KD reduces activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and reduces expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [5, 9], both of which have been implicated in hypoxia-driven immunosuppression [12]. Taken together these studies led us to hypothesize that the KD may alter the tumor microenvironment to alleviate immune suppression and enhance anti-tumor immunity.",c729232d-9eb8-4017-8ade-205277ed6814
3,background3,"  In this paper we investigated the role that an unrestricted KD plays in alleviating tumor immune suppression in a mouse model of malignant glioma. We studied the direct effects of this metabolic therapy on total infiltration and function of tumor-reactive T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as the indirect benefits of this metabolic therapy on alleviation of immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment.

11,results0,"KD enhanced survival is mediated by CD8+ T cells Tumor bearing animals maintained on the ketogenic diet (KD) had a greater median survival when compared to animals fed a standard diet (SD) (Fig. 1a). In order to effectively evaluate the importance of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells in slowing tumor progression, CD8+ T cells were depleted from immune competent albino C57BL/6 mice bearing tumors. There was a significant decrease in survival of mice depleted of CD8+ T cells prior to tumor cell inoculation in comparison to wild type mice maintained on SD (Fig. 1b). In order to determine the importance of CD8+ T cells in the anti-tumor effects of the KD, CD8+ T cell depleted animals were treated with the KD and survival was measured. Although the KD significantly improved survival in immune intact mice when compared to those maintained on SD, that difference in survival is lost when CD8+ T cells are depleted and mice are treated with the KD in comparison to immune intact mice fed SD (Fig. 1c).",20253a98-2c60-433e-98f7-e997dbe291e0

There was no significant difference in the percentage of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells between mice fed the KD and the SD (Fig. 2a). However, mice fed the KD had a significant increase in the percentage of CD4+ T cells infiltrating the tumor in comparison to SD (Fig. 2b). This increase in the percentage of CD4+ T cells was not due to an increase in the percentage of FoxP3 + CD4+ T regulatory (Treg) cells (Fig. 2c), and therefore the ratio of CD4+ T cells to Treg cells is significantly increased in tumors from mice fed a KD (Fig. 2e).",bfe6da18-d09b-4419-bbef-672c8dcc70a9

Similar results were found when looking at the total number of infiltrating cells (data not shown). Therefore, the KD enhances CD4+ T cell presence at the tumor site, and this increase is not associated with an increase in the T regulatory cell subset.Fig. 2 CD4+ T cell infiltration increases in mice fed the KD, without increases in Treg cell numbers.

17,results6," Intracellular cytokine staining following stimulation with tumor cells showed that when compared to SD, the KD significantly increases the ability of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells to produce interferon gamma (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)), and interleukin 2 (IL-2) when stimulated with GL261-Luc2 cells (Fig. 4a). Additionally, the KD significantly increased cytotoxic capabilities of tumor-reactive T cells from mice when compared to SD (Fig. 4b). The function of T regulatory cells was also assessed by intracellular cytokine staining for interleukin 10 (IL-10). Although we did not find a difference in the number of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, those found in the tumors from animals fed the KD produced significantly less IL-10 in response to GL261-Luc2 cells when compared to animals maintained on SD (Fig. 4c).",e0d915b7-cb9c-4a00-8159-6f4e5788bd2b

22,discussion0,"Activated effector immune responses against glioblastoma multiforme (Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)) may provide benefits in patient survival; however these tumors exert a variety of immunosuppressive pressures on the surrounding microenvironment [17, 18]. These include increased induction of CD8 + FOXp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), elevated immunosuppressive cytokine levels, diminished CD4+ helper T cell populations, tolerized antigen presenting cells and upregulated immune inhibitory checkpoints [19]. For example, Tregs suppress immune responses by secreting cytokines such as IL-10 and facilitating inactivation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells by direct cell-to-cell interactions [20]. A key observation in immunosuppressed Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients is a decrease in CD4+ T cells with an increased proportion of Tregs and increased IL-10 levels [19, 21].",0dbdfbaa-60c6-4db1-87c4-4936a8fe7a10
23,discussion1," The current study demonstrated that tumors from animals maintained on the KD had a significantly increased CD4+ T cell population and a decreased proportion of Tregs when compared to control animals. Further the Tregs isolated from animals maintained on the KD produced significantly less IL-10 when stimulated with tumor cells. Similar results were demonstrated in a study using a pancreatic cancer model which showed increased CD4+ T cells and decreased Tregs when animals were fed a KD [22].  In addition to increasing Tregs and IL-10 production in the microenvironment, tumors exploit immune inhibitory signaling pathways involving direct cell-to-cell interactions. Key mediators of this system include cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) which are found on the surface of activated effector T cells and act as checkpoints to regulate immune proliferation and activation.",fac9db1b-19d2-4c3a-8ce6-cdcbb93667d3
24,discussion2," For example, when PD-1 binds its ligand, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), activated CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are suppressed [23]. Increased PD-L1 expression has been observed on tumor cells and immune cells within the Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) microenvironment [24–27] and leads to direct inactivation of CD8+ T cells [28, 29]. The current study demonstrates significantly decreased expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and decreased expression of their ligands (PD-L1 and CD86, respectively) on dissociated tumor cells from animals maintained on the KD when compared to control animals. Blockade of the CTLA-4 and PD1 immune checkpoints represents a potentially important anti-glioma strategy that has proven effective in preclinical models of glioma [30–34] and has warranted exploration in ongoing clinical trials [35].",9ab80b5a-1e5c-476a-9c71-23c921667c6a
25,discussion3,"  The current study suggests that the KD may shift the immunological landscape from inflammatory, non-protective immune responses to cytotoxic Th1 responses and promotion of immune mediated killing at the tumor site. Shifting the balance toward a Th1 immune response leads to a general change in cytokine milieu at the tumor site which alters antigen presenting cell maturation and amount of overall immune cell activation [36–41]. This may explain results seen in this manuscript including increased NK and CD8+ T cell function, changes in CD4+ T cell recruitment, reduction in immune inhibitory receptor expression, and ligand availability on the tumor cells themselves. It should be noted that increased CD4 to CD8 T cell ratio may be indicative of a Th2 type immune response at the tumor site [42], which may promote an immune tolerance state; however, greater CD8 T cell activation in the tumors from mice maintained on a KD suggests this is not the case.",51a90f79-dee1-40d2-90d7-1ab81b8b5a59
26,discussion4,"  It is known that activated T cells undergo metabolic reprogramming in which glycolysis is required to support proliferation and efficient growth [43–46]. Recent evidence also suggests that reduced glucose availability and increased fatty acid oxidation favors T regulatory cells over effector T cells [47]. However, tumor-infiltrating T cells from mice fed the KD are still able to mount effective responses, undergo appropriate differentiation, and retain function even with the characteristic drop in glucose availability that accompanies the KD. It is currently unclear how the KD alters the metabolic activity of lymphocytes and why this effect appears to be specific to the lymphocytes isolated from the tumor microenvironment. It is possible that T-cells can utilize ketones as a primary energy source in place of glucose in a way similar to that of normal cells in the brain [48, 49].",0311c92a-ba2a-46f0-86b1-c8486082d966
27,discussion5," Recent work has suggested that tumor cells may outcompete other cells in the microenvironment for glucose and other nutrients, thereby reducing the activation of anti-tumor effector T cells [50, 51]. By providing ketones as an alternative energy source for lymphocytes it can be postulated that the KD may alleviate immunosuppression mediated by nutrient competition. Further studies are needed to explore this question and determine the precise role of ketones in T cell metabolism.  While the effect of the KD on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has only recently been explored, existing preclinical in vitro and in vivo data as well as case reports and anecdotal information have generated increased support for clinical testing. Prospective Phase I and II clinical trials have been initiated to assess the safety, efficacy and tolerability of the KD in patients with recurrent Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01754350; NCT01535911; NCT01865162; NCT02149459).",95e0fa47-0d7c-4c74-b821-8bd79cfde8f5
28,discussion6," In addition, we have initiated a phase I/II trial assessing the tolerability and efficacy of the KD up-front, concurrently with radiation and temozolomide in newly diagnosed Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients (NCT02046187) based on our preclinical data demonstrating that the KD, when given in combination with radiation, dramatically enhances survival when compared to radiation treatment alone [6]. The mechanisms underlying this effect are still under investigation; however, as radiation-induced tumor killing is known to expose the immune system to a greater diversity of tumor antigens, increased antigen processing, and increased immunogenic cytotoxicity it is possible that the KD as an adjuvant can work to augment the effect of radiation in part by enhancing immunity against Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).",aaead970-3437-457d-a991-200d88d7ad21
29,discussion7,"  Conclusions In summary, the KD may work as an immune adjuvant in the glioma microenvironment by reducing immune suppression, and promoting Th1 type immune responses against the tumor.
