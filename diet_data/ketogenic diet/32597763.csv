0,methods0," 4.1. Animals  All experimental protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Ursinus College (Animal Welfare Assurance: #D16-00678; IACUC Protocol: 81 #2017-ModA-SK). Female, C57BL6-NCrl mice were obtained from an in-house animal colony. Mice in the fed and fasting experiments were 12–14 weeks of age. For this study, food was removed at 0900 h during the light cycle. Blood glucose and ketone bodies were measured at baseline and at 90-min intervals after food restriction. In a separate cohort, mice at 12–14 weeks were fed with a ketogenic diet (KD) or standard chow for 5 weeks. Body weight was measured weekly. Mice were housed 3–5 mice per cage and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum except for the fasting protocol, in which food was removed for ~8 h during the light cycle.  4.2. Composition of Diet  The KD (Envigo Teklad Diets, TD.96355, Madison, WI, USA) consisted of 90.",8f8b9c50-0c9b-4213-a692-d7790c2b754a
1,methods1,"5% calories from fat, 0.3% calories from carbohydrates, and 9.2% calories from protein. The fatty acid composition consisted of 73% unsaturated (22% monounsaturated, 51% polyunsaturated) and 27% saturated fatty acids. The standard chow diet (LabDiet, #5001, St. Louis, MO, USA) consisted of 13.6% calories from fat, 57.9% calories from carbohydrates, and 28.7% calories from protein. Caloric intake was estimated based on the difference in the weight of the food provided and the weight of the food remaining after a two-day period. The weight of the food was converted to calories based on the manufacturer’s reported caloric yield: 3.36 kcal/g for chow and 6.7 kcal/g for KD.  4.3. Serum Analyses  Blood glucose was measured via a hand-held glucometer (Contour, Ascensia Diabetes Care, Parsippany, NJ, USA) using blood obtained from the tail tip. Serum ketone bodies were measured using a hand-held meter (Keto-Mojo, Keto-Check, Inc., Napa, CA, USA) from the tail tip.",70898351-eed9-4905-b0f0-860a70f43526
2,methods2," Serum fatty acids and cholesterol were measured in blood harvested from the chest cavity using commercially available kits (Wako Diagnostics, Mountain View, CA, USA) per the manufacturer’s instructions.  4.4. Endurance Exercise Capacity Tests  Mice from the fed vs. fasted and KD vs. chow cohorts were subjected to an endurance exercise capacity (endurance exercise capacity (EEC)) test on a motorized treadmill adapted from a previous study [67]. Mice were monitored by blinded researchers and motivated to run via non-aversive stimuli [68]. The endurance exercise capacity (EEC) protocol consisted of a graded protocol of increasing speeds, starting at 10 m/min for 15 min. The speed was increased to 12.6 m/min for an additional 15 min. Speeds were then increased by 2.4 m/min in 15-min intervals. The treadmill grade was constant at 10% throughout the protocol.",9d542f04-cb35-407e-92d4-3598ef18f6e0
3,methods3," The endurance exercise capacity (EEC) was completed when the mice were unable to run continuously on the treadmill for at least 10 s or the final stage was completed. Prior to the endurance exercise capacity (EEC), all mice were acclimated on the treadmill for 4 consecutive days for 10 min at a speed of 10 m/min. All exercise sessions occurred between 1700 and 1900 h, near or at the start of the dark cycle. At the immediate conclusion of the endurance exercise capacity (EEC), fed and fasted mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (170 mg/kg). Serum was collected and tissues (heart, epididymal adipose tissue, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius) were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were stored at −80 °C. Chow-fed and KD mice had blood glucose and ketone body concentrations assessed at the beginning and end of the endurance exercise capacity (EEC) test.",60e2134e-b76e-432f-adad-49d1e70ea410
4,methods4," At the conclusion of the endurance exercise capacity (EEC) test, mice were allowed to recover in the animal facility for approximately 72 h, prior to further analysis.  4.5. Gravimetric Analysis  After the endurance exercise capacity (EEC), KD and chow fed mice were returned to the animal facility for approximately 72 h. After the recovery period, mice were injected with sodium pentobarbital (170 mg/kg, IP). After confirming sedation with the toe-pinch test, serum was collected, and tissues (heart, inguinal fat pad, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius) were removed and weighed. For cardiac hypertrophy comparisons, the heart weight to tibia length (HW:TL) ratio was determined. For other size comparisons, the quadriceps weight or adipose tissue to body weight ratio was determined. After weighing, tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.  4.6.",7c979bab-9d97-4027-9595-1468ddbc9f47
5,methods5," Biochemical Analysis in Tissues  Glycogen content was assessed in frozen heart, gastrocnemius, and liver tissues by determining the amount of glucose released from glycogen with a commercially available kit (Sigma Aldrich, GAHK-20, St. Louis, MO, USA). Glycogen was separated from exogenous glucose in the tissue using an alkaline extraction procedure [69]. Triglycerides were extracted and measured from frozen heart, gastrocnemius, and liver tissue using a triglyceride colorimetric assay kit (Cayman Chemicals, #10010303, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).  4.7. Analysis of Gene Expression  RNA was extracted from heart, gastrocnemius, and liver tissues using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, #74104, Hilden, Germany). Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis was performed using omniscript reverse transcriptase and random hexamers, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Omniscript RT Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).",9b57cedb-3ec1-4381-ad1e-ac5d70c3aa29
6,methods6," Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed using SYBR-Green (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The mRNA levels of genes involved in glucose, lipid, and ketone body metabolism were normalized to 18s rRNA. Primer sequences have been previously published [70]. Values were determined as a fold change over controls.  4.8. Statistical Analysis  All data are presented as means ± standard error (standard error (SEM)). Statistical analysis was tested using a Student’s t-test for all two group comparisons. For 4-group comparisons, a two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis was used. For longitudinal data, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with a Bonferroni post-hoc test was used. Statistical analysis was tested at the p < 0.05 level. All graphs and analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0.
