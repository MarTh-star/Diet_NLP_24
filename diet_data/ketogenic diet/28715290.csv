Participants were recruited from April 2011 to December 2012 from the following sites: Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London; National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London; Evelina Children's Hospital, London; St George's Hospital, London; Young Epilepsy (including Matthew's Friends clinics for Ketogenic Dietary Therapies), Surrey; Birmingham Children's Hospital, Birmingham; Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge; Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool; Bristol Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Bristol, all in the UK; Austin Health and The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.",6e48bf42-0506-4cc0-a59c-b6be796b98d8
1,methods1,"  Study inclusion criteria were as follows: individuals aged ≥3 months who were either following ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), who were soon to be commencing ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), or who had followed ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) in the past for their epilepsy. Exclusion criteria were as follows: individuals who discontinued ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) before the 3‐month point due to lack of tolerability (but those who discontinued ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) before the 3‐month point due to lack of response or seizure increase were not excluded); individuals with known GLUT1 deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, or other metabolic disorders; and individuals with progressive myoclonic epilepsies (as lack of response may be due to the progressive nature of the condition).  In the UK clinics and Austin Health, every individual eligible for recruitment was invited to participate.",9ec3f732-f764-487c-83f7-0a6bd5047802
2,methods2," All cases from The Royal Children's Hospital, Australia, were recruited retrospectively.  2.2 Categorization of ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) response ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) response was defined as a function of seizure frequency, as published previously.13, 14 Response was estimated in 28‐day epochs prior to starting the diet (baseline) and prior to 3‐month follow‐up after the start of ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT). Clinic letters and seizure diaries, where already used as part of clinical monitoring, were used to estimate seizure frequency at each time point. The calculation used to determine percentage reduction in seizure frequency was as follows: [(a‐b)/a]*100, where a = number of seizures in the 28 days prior to ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) initiation; b = number of seizures in the 28 days preceding the 3‐month point.  Cases with ≥50% seizure reduction were classified as “responders”; those with <50% seizure reduction were “nonresponders.",7f856410-6337-4c1d-9ae4-3b27125a8078

There was no minimum time period for which participants should have continued ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT), to enable inclusion of extreme nonresponders who may have discontinued dietary treatment within days/week.  2.3 Effect of demographic, clinical, and biochemical factors on ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) response Clinical and demographic data were obtained from hospital records. For individuals with these data available, the effect of clinical/demographic factors on ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) response at 3‐month follow‐up was assessed by t‐test (for continuous variables all were normally distributed) or Pearson χ2 (for categorical or binary variables), as appropriate.",763225f0-5b76-4ab4-805d-57c339399683

The association between selected biochemical parameters taken at baseline, at 3‐month follow‐up, and the difference in results at these two time points, with ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) response at 3 months, was also assessed by t‐test or Pearson χ2, as appropriate. Biochemical parameters were selected based on their role in fat and carbohydrate metabolism, as described previously.15 A Bonferroni‐corrected significance threshold was calculated, based on an alpha of 0.05 and the number of tests conducted. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed, considering ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) response at 3‐month follow‐up as outcome variable and each clinical, demographic, and biochemical factor was tested as an independent variable.

28,discussion0," We conducted a genome‐wide association study (GWAS) for responsiveness to ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT). Service provision for ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) is limited, even in resource‐rich countries, and so the numbers of cases available for inclusion, with adequate data and a limited collection timeframe, is inevitably small. Despite this, our study is reasonably powered to identify common variation of large effect size, which is the most important for clinical prediction and mechanistic understanding. We show that the minor allele of rs12204701 is associated (P = 3.83x10‐8, odds ratio [A] = 13.5) with poor response (<50% seizure reduction) to ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) at 3‐month follow‐up.

29,discussion1,"  rs12204701 is a noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located 61 kb upstream of Chromodomain Y‐like (CDYL), and so may have a regulatory function. Chromodomain Y‐like (CDYL) is a transcriptional corepressor that is expressed ubiquitously in humans and that is required for the transmission/restoration of repressive histone marks, which is critical for the maintenance of cell identity.26 Chromodomain Y‐like (CDYL) drives neuronal migration27 and regulates activity‐dependent intrinsic neuronal plasticity.28 It transcriptionally represses SCN8A, the gene encoding Nav1.6 sodium channels, causing a reduction in axonal Nav1.6 currents, the dysfunction of which are associated with epilepsy, including severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, and other neurologic and psychiatric brain disorders.",37051cfd-9965-4eab-8814-6204ae7a75b5
30,discussion2,"28 Chromodomain Y‐like (CDYL) regulates dendrite morphogenesis in rat/mouse hippocampal neurons29 and its deficiency increases excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons and susceptibility to epilepsy in mice.27 Of the 22 proteins found to interact with Chromodomain Y‐like (CDYL), most play a role in transcriptional repression.30 Chromodomain Y‐like (CDYL) is involved in the repression of transcription of the proto‐oncogene TrkC, which is important for suppression of cellular transformation30; this is of interest because of the neuroprotective properties of ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) and the potential role of apoptosis in its mechanisms of action in this regard.31, 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s located in the region encompassing the association signal, between KU‐MEL‐3 and Chromodomain Y‐like (CDYL), have also been associated with phenotypic traits relevant to metabolism of high‐fat, low‐carbohydrate diet: cholesterol levels33 and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.",96fc6c48-9558-49c7-8298-83e43030dead
31,discussion3,"34 rs12204701 may tag other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s or even copy number variants that may influence ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) response. Based on an assumption that promoter‐enhancer interactions can occur only within specific topologically associated domain (TAD)s,35 Chromodomain Y‐like (CDYL) would appear to be the most likely target for this putative regulatory region. Our leading hypothesis is therefore that the variant may affect an enhancer element that regulates Chromodomain Y‐like (CDYL) or is in linkage disequilibrium with a variant affecting an enhancer of Chromodomain Y‐like (CDYL).  In conclusion, our analyses in patients who are negative for GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (caused by SLC2A1 mutation) indicate that rs12204701 is associated with poor response to ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT). Chromodomain Y‐like (CDYL) is, due to its vicinity and function, the most likely candidate gene.",471e6159-e45c-49a3-ad05-19618f45d7af
32,discussion4," The putative effect of genetic variation on ketogenic dietary therapy (KDT) response remains largely unknown, other than in specific metabolic disorders. We recognize that our study is of small numbers of participants, but nevertheless has demonstrated an association we consider important to bring to a wider audience. The relevance of rs12204701 merits further exploration with a replication cohort, ideally with a large enough cohort size to allow sufficient power to detect effects from less common variants or those with lesser effect sizes, and perhaps also to permit appropriately powered sub‐analyses of people with distinct epilepsy etiologies and syndromes.
