0,introduction0," Acute Encephalitis is associated with a high risk of acute symptomatic seizures, status epilepticus, and remote symptomatic epilepsy. Ketogenic diet therapies (Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT)) have been established as a feasible and safe adjunctive management of refractory- and super-refractory status epilepticus. However, the role of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) in the chronic management of Post-encephalitic epilepsy (PE) and autoimmune-associated epilepsy (AE) is unknown. This study aims to investigate the use of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) in patients with PE and AE.   Acute encephalitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with an estimated annual global incidence of 0.07–12.6 cases per 100,000 (1). It is associated with a high risk of acute symptomatic seizures, status epilepticus, and remote symptomatic epilepsy (2). The risk of post-encephalitic epilepsy (PE) ranges from 10 to 40% across several studies (2–5).",09b9916a-dadc-40e6-822a-31ef57a9ef47
1,introduction1," Over the past two decades, numerous neural auto-antibodies associated with encephalitis, seizures, and epilepsy have been discovered (6). This has led to a significant increase in the incidence of identified patients with autoimmune encephalitis and epilepsy (7). Autoimmune-associated epilepsy (AE) or autoimmune epilepsy is now recognized as an important etiology in a subset of patients with both acute symptomatic seizures and chronic epilepsy (6, 8–10). In a 2018 study, the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis were comparable to those of infectious encephalitis (11). Treatment of patients with AE is comprised of multiple lines of immunotherapy (particularly in the acute phase) and anti-seizure drugs when indicated (6).  Ketogenic diets therapies (Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT)) are characterized by a reduced carbohydrate intake along with a relative increase in the proportions of fat and protein to promote fat metabolism (12).",3836713b-3755-4dfe-b5c7-9cedd49ca348
2,introduction2," Since the early 2000s, Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) variants have been investigated as a potential therapeutic option for adult patients with intractable epilepsy and status epilepticus (12, 13).  There are five types of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) used in adults: the classic ketogenic diet (classic ketogenic diet (CKD)), and less restrictive diets including the modified ketogenic diet (modified ketogenic diet (MKD)), medium chain triglyceride (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) oil ketogenic diet, low glycemic index treatment (low glycemic index treatment (LGIT)), and the modified Atkins diet (modified Atkins diet (MAD)) (14). In adult patients, modified Atkins diet (MAD) is typically prescribed as a net 20 g/day carbohydrate limit, which is equivalent to a ratio of 1–2:1 of fat to protein and carbohydrates combined (15).",c8043c57-6ac4-4d81-994a-96d94f0e23ef
3,introduction3,"  Several reports have demonstrated the efficacy of the classic ketogenic diet in patients with super-refractory status epilepticus (super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE))) of multiple etiologies (16, 17). classic ketogenic diet (CKD) appears to be particularly beneficial in patients with new-onset refractory status epilepticus (new onset refractory status epilepticus (NOrefractory status epilepticus (RSE))) and specifically Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome (Febrile Infection Related Epilepsy Syndrome (FIRES)) (18–21). While the etiology of new onset refractory status epilepticus (NOrefractory status epilepticus (RSE)) in most patients remains unknown, the most common identifiable etiology is either autoimmune or viral encephalitis (19, 22, 23).",bcc366a8-37b6-4467-8f7b-34e90fb3ebd9
4,introduction4,"  Although several reports have studied the use of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) in the acute settings of encephalitis and super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)), no prior studies have evaluated its use in patients with chronic post-encephalitic (PE) and autoimmune-associated (AE) epilepsies. This investigation aims to evaluate the use of modified Atkins diet (MAD) in patients with post-infectious and autoimmune-associated epilepsies. We present a case series treated at the Johns Hopkins Adult Epilepsy Diet Center along with a brief review of the literature for comparison.  ",09c0094b-b725-49bf-948d-2d21e2ea6c3b

Patient Inclusion  This was a retrospective case series performed at the Johns Hopkins Adult Epilepsy Diet Center (Adult Epilepsy Diet Center (AEDC)). A prospectively assembled clinical database of all patients evaluated for Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) at the Johns Hopkins Adult Epilepsy Diet Center (Adult Epilepsy Diet Center (AEDC)) was approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board and all participants or their legally authorized representative provided written consent to be included. Out of this database, we identified adult patients with post-encephalitic (PE) and autoimmune-associated (AE) epilepsies who were evaluated at Adult Epilepsy Diet Center (AEDC) from January 2014 to 2020.",458c7908-b3f4-4636-b300-2f6cc4ddd20a
6,methods1," Patients with childhood (<18 years old) onset of their encephalitis or epilepsy were excluded, those without quantifiable seizures prior to starting modified Atkins diet (MAD), as well as patients who declined participation in the database. PE was defined as persistent seizures after an episode of encephalitis (24), while AE is defined as per the consensus criteria (25). A subset of the patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were previously described in studies evaluating the use of ketogenic diet in super-refractory status epilepticus and new-onset refractory status epilepticus during their acute course while this study focuses on long-term outcomes (16, 17, 19).

Four patients had either confirmed or presumed viral encephalitis, five patients had seronegative AE, and one patient had glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)65 AE. The median latency between starting modified Atkins diet (MAD) and onset of encephalitis was 6 years (IQR: 1–10). The median duration of modified Atkins diet (MAD) was 10 months (IQR: 3.75–36). Three patients (30%) became seizure-free, one patient (10%) achieved 90% seizure freedom, and three patients (30%) achieved a 50–75% reduction in their baseline seizure frequency, while three patients (30%) had no significant benefit. Overall, seven patients (70%) achieved ≥50% seizure reduction.",f57b8698-d8dd-40c4-bc40-472e6d45411b
9,results1,"  Conclusion: In addition to its established role in the treatment of refractory status epilepticus (RSE), Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) may be a safe and feasible option for the treatment of chronic PE and AE, particularly in those with prior history of SE. Prospective studies are warranted to explore the efficacy of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) in management of patients with PE and AE.  modified Atkins diet encephalitis autoimmune epilepsy drug-resistant status epilepticus SE ==== Body  Fifteen patients with adult-onset PE or AE were evaluated to initiate modified Atkins diet (MAD) at the Adult Epilepsy Diet Center (AEDC).",61922575-97d7-4e65-a4ab-46af99295fed
10,results2," Five patients were excluded from analysis for the following reasons: one patient received education on modified Atkins diet (MAD) initiation and never started, one patient was lost to follow up, two patients were non-adherent with the diet and stopped it early (within 2–4 weeks), and one patient who was seizure-free on ASDs and was interested in using modified Atkins diet (MAD) as adjunctive therapy to potentially lower ASD burden.  Ten patients with PE and AE met the inclusion criteria. Four patients had viral or presumed viral encephalitis (three unknown pathogens and one with California encephalitis), five patients had seronegative AE, and one patient had glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)65 antibody-associated epilepsy.

The median on-diet duration was 10 months (IQR: 4–28), suggesting that modified Atkins diet (MAD) was feasible to maintain long-term in this patient population. As previously shown in other studies (26), patients who experience improvement in their seizures had longer on-diet duration.",080146c0-10ef-49a4-98b8-6341f2fb5333
19,discussion1," Data extrapolated from children suggests that most responders experience a reduction in seizures on Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) within 14 days from initiation of the diet (27). A consensus recommendation from the International Ketogenic Diet Study Group is to continue the Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) for at least a mean of 3.2 months (±1.3 months SD) before assessing its efficacy (14).  The majority of patients in this study (70%) presented with an episode of refractory status epilepticus as an initial presenting symptom. A classic ketogenic diet was first introduced in 30% of patients studied in the setting of super-refractory status epilepticus. Refractory status epilepticus (refractory status epilepticus (RSE)) occurs when status epilepticus (SE) persists despite the administration of at least 2 parenteral anti-seizure drugs (including an appropriately-dosed benzodiazepine). About 15–22.6% of cases of SE progress to refractory status epilepticus (RSE) (28, 29).",756c38e0-d5c4-442e-a890-0b633ad62627
20,discussion2," Of those, another 22% continue to progress to super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)) (30) which is defined as SE persisting or recurred after appropriate anesthetic treatment (31, 32). Both refractory status epilepticus (RSE) and super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)) carry high rates of morbidity and mortality (33). The prevalence of SE in patients with acute encephalitis ranges between 4 and 20% (34–36), while the prevalence of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) ranges between 24 and 57% (34, 36) and the prevalence of super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)) has not been well-established.  Several prospective and retrospective studies evaluated the use of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) in the treatment of super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)) of various etiologies (16, 17, 37).",32861b16-f069-4112-b9f2-390bcc4fceec
21,discussion3," In several case series, a classic ketogenic diet (classic ketogenic diet (CKD)) was effective in abolishing SE in 73–90% of patients (16, 17, 37). A summary of all adult patients with super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)) due to presumed encephalitic and immune-mediated etiologies treated with adjunctive classic ketogenic diet (CKD) is presented in Table 3. Thirty-four adult patients received classic ketogenic diet (CKD), the median age of patients at the onset of super refractory status epilepticus (Srefractory status epilepticus (RSE)) and classic ketogenic diet (CKD) initiation was 28.5 (21–40). The majority of the patients responded with cessation of SE, suggesting possible benefit, although there were no control groups used for comparison.

24,discussion8," A retrospective study showed higher seizure freedom rates with sodium channel agents (carbamazepine, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, and lacosamide) in patients with AE (46), while there was no difference in the seizure relapse rates between valproate and levetiracetam in another retrospective study (3). Patients with PE and AE are more likely to have multi-focal epilepsy and are therefore not ideal epilepsy surgery candidates, and have been shown to have worse epilepsy surgery outcomes when compared to other etiologies of drug-resistant epilepsy (47, 48). More recently, neuromodulation therapy was reported in patients with AE. Feyissa et al. (49) reported four patients with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-65 associated epilepsy treated with responsive neurostimulation (responsive neurostimulation (RNS)) system. Three patients achieved ≥50% seizure reduction and one patient became seizure-free after responsive neurostimulation (RNS) data-guided temporal lobectomy (49).",694302af-819d-4d21-919b-35449708e299
25,discussion9," In addition to immunotherapy, anti-seizure drugs, and neuromodulation, our case series adds ketogenic diet therapy to the list of potential treatments for epilepsy in patients with PE and AE.  Mechanisms by which Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) may be effective management of seizures in AE and PE are under investigation. The exact pathophysiology of chronic AE and PE which leads to seizures has not been fully elucidated (45). It is hypothesized that varying degrees of persistent inflammation, post-encephalitic structural processes (for example mesial temporal sclerosis), or both processes may contribute (45). There is a growing body of evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory properties of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) (50). Beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome assembly which in turn decreases caspase-1 activation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (51).",6e4f40b7-e0bb-44cb-a137-97ecaa40928b
26,discussion10," Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) increases the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids that can bind and activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (50). Additionally, the Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) increases adenosine levels in the brain, which has anti-inflammatory effects (52). Moreover, Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) have antioxidant effects (53) and may modulate mitochondrial function by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) (54). Therefore, Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) may be effective for the management of seizures in AE and PE not only because of anti-seizure properties but also by anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action, which could explain the high response rate seen in the patients reported here.  Our study have several limitations aside from its retrospective nature.",6e5f47c7-661a-4d7b-9fa8-c0db25a1a179
27,discussion11," As a quaternary referral center, patients were often treated following their initial presentation and therefore the exact details surrounding the acute encephalitis episode in some patients were not available. Also, two patients were not monitored on EEG to confirm the diagnosis and localization of focal epilepsy which was determined based on clinical presentation. Moreover, the small sample size and the lack of control group might limit the generalizability of our findings. Finally, patients were on anti-seizure drugs, immunotherapy, and other treatments that were not rigorously documented at the time of treatment and may have impacted seizure control independent of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT).  Conclusions  In addition to its potential role in the treatment of acute refractory status epilepticus in patients with PE and AE, ketogenic diet therapies may be feasible and safe in the management of chronic post-encephalitic and autoimmune-associated epilepsy.",5331763d-2da6-42c4-bfa8-960d7f45101e
28,discussion12," Patients with prior history of SE might respond better to Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT). Further studies are needed to explore the efficacy of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) in managing seizures in patients with PE and AE. Moreover, whether the early use of Ketogenic diet therapies (KDT) can alter the pathophysiology, prognosis, and outcome of patients with encephalitis warrants further exploration.
