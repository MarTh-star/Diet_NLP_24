0,introduction0," Ketogenic diets (KDs) have been demonstrated to promote weight loss, often to a greater extent than low-fat diets, and without explicit instructions to limit calories (1–4). Some authors have suggested that low-carbohydrate diets may facilitate a metabolic advantage by increasing energy expenditure (5), but others have argued against such an effect (6). Irrespective of whether KDs promote greater weight loss than non-KDs, an important unresolved question is how KDs impact the tissue composition and distribution of weight loss, especially when matched for calories. Ideally, weight loss diets promote loss of fat mass (FM), especially visceral adipose tissue (visceral adipose tissue (VAT)), while preserving lean tissue.  A plausible approach to support muscle anabolism during a hypocaloric KD is the use of exogenous ketone salts (KS), which enhance ketosis while also providing additional sodium and potentially other minerals (e.g., potassium, calcium, magnesium).",8602b504-6404-4691-8279-211dbd91f38d
1,introduction1," Oral ingestion of ketone salts consisting of beta-hydroxybutyrate (Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB)) and minerals is a safe and effective method of transiently increasing circulating ketones as we (7) and others (8) have shown. Notably, prior studies have demonstrated that ketosis achieved by intravenous infusion of sodium Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) preserves fat free mass (fat free mass (FFM)) during very low-calorie diets and starvation (9, 10). Sodium Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) infusion to levels within the higher range of nutritional ketosis (i.e., ~2–4 mM) has also been shown to increase skeletal muscle protein synthesis, decrease leucine oxidation, and inhibit protein breakdown (11, 12).",d5a120da-8cb5-4392-8a12-024993a5c815
2,introduction2," There is also evidence that ketone bodies may protect from muscle loss in catabolic settings such as sarcopenia, cachexia, and excessive inflammation (12–15), perhaps through mTORC1 signaling (16, 17). Based on evidence from these prior studies, we hypothesized that augmenting ketosis by oral ingestion of Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB)-salts might lead to preservation of muscle during a hypocaloric KD intervention in humans.  Whereas, many studies have demonstrated that short-term hypocaloric, low-carbohydrate diets result in preservation of fat free mass (FFM) and preferential loss of fat (18–21), including visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (4), other studies have reported similar (22, 23) or greater loss of lean body mass in subjects on KDs (24, 25). Several factors may explain the discrepant results on the composition of weight loss to KDs.",85b7edd9-c0ee-430e-ba50-78270ead3387
3,introduction3," First, consuming protein at a level <1 g/kg ideal body mass impairs nitrogen balance while an intake closer to 1.5 g/kg ideal body mass appears optimal during hypocaloric diets for maintaining lean mass (20, 24, 26). Second, many KD studies failed to provide adequate sodium to compensate for the natriuretic effect of these diets, resulting in counter-regulatory hormonal responses that adversely impacts sodium and potassium balance (23). In the KD studies that did not provide adequate sodium, nitrogen balance, and lean mass were compromised (24, 25). Lastly, common methods of assessing body composition, such as hydro-densitometry and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA)), detect water loss as a decrease in lean tissue, but this does not reflect a change in whole-body intracellular protein.",5472283c-059c-4ba2-a7d9-091bc0787621
4,introduction4," For example, reduced extra-vascular volume and intra-cellular glycogen (~3 g of water is stored with each gram of glycogen), which can easily account for 2–3 kg during the first few weeks of a KD (22, 27), would be artifactually detected as a loss of lean tissue.  Collectively, these data highlight a potential role of well-formulated KDs with adequate protein and sodium to improve preservation and lean body mass during weight loss, with potential added benefit of exogenous ketones. Using a randomized, controlled-feeding, double-blind design, the primary objective of this study was to explore the composition of weight loss, including advanced imaging assessment of fat and lean mass as well as nitrogen excretion and 3-methylhistidine (3MH), to a well-formulated KD with and without KS supplementation. After completing this primary objective, we decided it would be valuable to compare these KD group responses to a matched group of obese adults fed a hypocaloric low-fat diet.",8a375f25-ab61-4d55-8d69-5af0d24ec6c0
5,introduction5," We used dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess whole body adiposity and lean mass, magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) to assess visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and thigh skeletal muscle cross-sectional areas, as well as nitrogen balance and 3MH to provide additional measures of protein metabolism.

6,methods0," Overweight and obese adults were provided a precisely defined hypocaloric KD (~75% of energy expenditure) for 6 weeks. In a double-blind manner, subjects were randomly assigned to receive ~24 g/day of a racemic Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB)-salt (KD + KS; n = 12) or placebo (KD + PL; n = 13). A matched comparison group (n = 12) was separately assigned to an isoenergetic/isonitrogenous low-fat diet (low fat diet (LFD)). Body composition parameters were assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging.   Experimental Design and Subjects  This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind study design. For the primary aim, we planned to randomize and balance n = 28 (14 men/14 women) in two KD groups. Eligibility was determined based on BMI (27–35 kg/m2) and age (21–65 years). Twenty-eight participants were consented and 25 completers were analyzed.",db28b90e-121d-4859-80d4-60a6048f6798
7,methods1," We performed a stratified randomization where “age” and “BMI” were divided “below” or “above” the median range of the inclusion criteria. Following stratification, we used an online number generator (www.randomizer.org) to randomize eight rounds of three participants to either a ketogenic diet + ketone supplement (KD + KS, n = 12, 6 men/6 women) or ketogenic diet + placebo (KD + PL, n = 13, 6 men/7 women). An extra male participant was added to KD + PL due to enrolment errors. For the secondary aim, we enrolled a separate, non-randomized group of age and BMI-matched participants who received an isoenergetic/isonitrogenous low-fat diet (low fat diet (LFD), n = 12, 6 men/6 women) and participated in the same testing as the KD groups.",ee5db428-ea96-472b-95d8-c9642ab7642c

Participants who met the qualifying criteria were scheduled for an in-person screening meeting where the study was described in greater detail followed by completing questionnaires about food frequency, medical history, physical activity, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) readiness, and a menstrual history survey. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics of completers between groups (Table 1). All participants were Caucasian.

Individual menu composition had custom macro- and micro-nutrients calculated by a team of registered dietitians using advanced nutrient analysis software (Table 2) (Nutritionist Pro, Axxya Systems, Redmond, WA). Both KDs were designed based on our previous work (28, 29). The low fat diet (LFD) was developed in accordance with the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Healthy Americans 2015–2020 (30). Ideal body weight was calculated based on the Metropolitan Life Tables for medium frame populations to establish a 1.5 g protein/kg of ideal body weight for each participant (31). The total daily energy required for weight-maintenance was derived from Harris-Benedict basal metabolic rate multiplied by physical activity level (physical activity level (PAL)) (32). physical activity level (PAL) was determined based on previous guidelines for sedentary individuals created by the Institute of Medicine (33). Average physical activity level (PAL) multiplier was estimated at 1.",b4f4c16a-a406-4e11-b333-ebc2d5de56c6

Both KDs provided ~40 g/day of carbohydrates and the remaining non-protein calories were derived from fat, with an emphasis on monounsaturated and saturated fat sources. The low fat diet (LFD) provided 25% of energy from lipids with <10% saturated fat and <30 g added oils. Carbohydrates were primarily complex and provided at least 32 g/fiber per day with limited and added sugars (<25 g). Ad libitum intake of calorie-free/sodium-free products was allowed during the entire intervention. A variety of whole foods were used to develop both ketogenic and low-fat meals. Meal plans were developed to include a wide range of high-quality protein sources to be distributed equally between breakfast, lunch, and dinner (Supplementary Table 1) with minor differences in total amino acid (AA) intake, particularly histidine (low fat diet (LFD) vs. KD: −520 ± 20 mg/day).",7b8ddfcd-83f6-4865-9914-b876e00a5e75
11,methods7," Because the low fat diet (LFD) was designed in accordance with Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a minor percentage of the total protein was derived from plant sources such as quinoa, whole grain pasta/rice/bread, oatmeal, legumes (8–10%), compared to predominantly animal protein in the KD. A portion of the protein for the KD groups was provided as two daily chocolate or vanilla shakes that contained whey protein isolate (~15 g/serving) along with fat in the form of high oleic sunflower oil and medium chain fatty acids (medium chain fatty acids (MCT)). Assessment of capillary glycemic response over 2 h following the ketogenic shake in healthy participants (n = 10) compared with a white bread control matched for total carbohydrate content (9 g), demonstrated that there was no glycemic response to these shakes (Supplementary Figure 2).",8d328c8f-37c8-4856-ab31-bc3514cbba2b
12,methods8," In addition, subjects in the KD groups consumed one serving of 10 g medium chain fatty acids (MCT) oil (caprylic and capric acid; Metagenics, Inc) with their breakfast and one serving in the afternoon snack.  Supplement  The KD + KS group consumed a ketone supplement, twice daily, consisting of Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) salts and non-caloric flavoring (provided by Metagenics, Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA). This particular KS has been previously reported to raise Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) 4 to 5-fold in capillary blood of non-keto adapted individuals, with significant effects observed up to 1-h post-ingestion (34). One KS serving contained 11.8 g Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB), 1,874 mg sodium, 570 mg calcium, and 57 mg magnesium.",4e9b0d8f-12ca-44cd-8c7a-6401849d4309

Participants in the KD-KS group were instructed to mix the KS in at least 250 ml of water and stir vigorously to ensure proper mixing. One dose was taken in the morning and one 6h later after lunch. Because the ketone supplement contained calories in the form of Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the fat content of the KD + KS group was reduced by ~120 kcal/day to ensure that all three diets were isocaloric.",96c3c9a6-b9c9-4714-a673-56a8fe3c103d
14,methods10, The KD + PL group and the low fat diet (LFD) received a calorie-free flavored placebo that contained no Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) or minerals. The placebo was specifically formulated by the sponsor to mimic the taste and appearance of active supplement including flavoring but contain no Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB)-salts. The same placebo was used in a previous trial with no blinding problems (33). In our pilot testing with the Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) salt we compared the supplement to the placebo in a double-blind setting with members of the group who were not involved in data collection and analysis (n = 3). Based on their feedback there were no discernable traits between the Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) salt and placebo drinks.,42892369-115d-43e8-a85f-77848723a38d
15,methods11," Based on conversations with participants throughout the study, we feel confident that they were not aware which supplement they received.  Lab Procedures  A battery of tests were performed biweekly at WK0 (baseline), WK2, WK4, and WK6. All participants reported to the testing facility between 5:00 and 7:00 a.m. for their assessments (PAES Building, 305 Annie and John Glenn Ave, Columbus, OH). Arrival conditions stipulated that subjects consume no caffeine for >12 h, no food for >8 h, sleep 8–10 h the night before testing, and abstain from strenuous exercise <48 h prior to the visit. Weight and height were measured on an electronic stadiometer (SECA 703 Digital, Hamburg, Germany) calibrated to the nearest ±0.1 cm and ±0.01 kg, respectively, while participants wore light clothing and no shoes.

Waist and hip measurements were performed by the same investigator using a manual tape (Gulick Spring Tape) to measure circumference at the narrowest part of the waist and the greater trochanter region according to previous testing guidelines (35). Resting energy expenditure (Resting energy expenditure (REE)) and respiratory exchange ratio (respiratory exchange ratio (RER)) were measured via indirect calorimetry (ParvoMedics TrueOne® 2,400) (36). After a 20 min supine rest, gas exchanges were measured for 25 min at 15-s intervals. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was selected from a stable, average interval recorded within the last 5 min of continuous readings to avoid artificial number inflations caused by early Resting energy expenditure (REE) fluctuations during calibration.",f57f8089-d94f-44ff-b20e-4b068b1b1f6f
17,methods13,"  Fasting Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations were assessed in capillary blood using reagent strips and a monitoring device (Abbot FreeStyle®, Columbus, OH). Outside of test days, participants reported fasted ketones every morning during the study via image texts sent to research staff. Fasting venous blood samples were collected on testing days via venipuncture in the antecubital fossa. A single plasma tube (10ml) was inverted and spun immediately after blood draw at 1200 × G for 10 min at 4°C. Plasma fractions were aliquoted in screwcap vial containers, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C for subsequent analysis. Plasma 3MH was assayed in duplicate using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Wuhan Fine Biotech). Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 4.3 and 6.8%, respectively.  For urine collection, participants were provided with a 3.",f3d088e4-1565-4a92-aa76-887fa98119d2

Of note, the first 24 h urine collection was not a true baseline because it occurred during day one of the KD and KS intervention. Thus, the baseline 24 h period included initial exposure to ketogenic meals as well as two doses of the KS or PL. The containers were pre-treated with a stabilizer (Gentamicin 20 mg, Germall II 1.25 g) to prevent metabolite degradation and disappearance at room temperature. All urine samples were returned immediately after the 24 h period, the total volume recorded, and aliquots stored at −20°C before shipping to an off-campus collaborator (Litholink Corporation, Chicago, IL, USA).

Manual traces were drawn in the anterior, posterior, and medial compartment of the thigh then combined to obtain a whole muscle cross sectional area (CSA) value. The contours were drawn so as to avoid inter-muscular fat and artifacts using ImageJ (41).  Statistics  The sample size chosen was based on what has been done in similar feeding studies (21, 23–25, 27) and what was feasible to accomplish based on the available funding and resources.

WK2 Urine urea nitrogen (UUN) was significantly higher than WK4 (p < 0.05) and WK6 (p < 0.01). Group effects show on average 8% lower Urine urea nitrogen (UUN) during KD + KS compared to KD + PL (p = 0.082).

32,results12," With low fat diet (LFD) included in the secondary 3 (group) × 4 (time) ANOVA – Time effect: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 from WK0.  KD + KS vs. KD + PL vs. low fat diet (LFD)  For most parameters, the low fat diet (LFD) responded in a similar manner as the KDs with a few notable exceptions (Supplementary Table 2). The KDs significantly altered ketones and respiratory exchange ratio (RER), but these variables were not altered by the low fat diet (LFD). WC reductions were evident only by WK6 on low fat diet (LFD) (−2.9 ± 1.0 cm; p = 0.008) whereas, Waist to hip ratio (WHR) was not significantly altered in this group. We discovered a significant interaction for WC and Waist to hip ratio (WHR), with both KD groups showing a greater decrease. The main group effect for Urine urea nitrogen (UUN) was significant in the 3 × 4 ANOVA (p = 0.015) and revealed that the KD + PL group excreted significantly more urea nitrogen than low fat diet (LFD) (p = 0.",07ec2df3-1fc2-468e-90c0-dffd27e66e6e
33,results13,004) (Figure 3A) while trending higher compared to KD + KS (p = 0.076). There was a significant time effect for 3MH that indicated higher concentrations at WK2 (p < 0.05) and WK6 (p < 0.01) compared to baseline (Figure 4). ,c0c71976-c464-4e4d-94c5-c60d0cc3ed23
34,discussion0," This study investigated the effects of daily exogenous ketone Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplementation (in the form of a racemic Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) salt) in the context of a 6-week energy-controlled ketogenic feeding intervention that produced clinically meaningful weight loss. Although the KS transiently elevated Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations beyond the KD alone, it did not alter the magnitude of weight loss or changes in whole body and regional tissue composition including visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and thigh muscle cross sectional area (CSA).",3c6e8db2-3ca4-476f-8f52-87a8c2d94500
35,discussion1," There was a trend for lower Urine urea nitrogen (UUN) with the addition of a KS to the KD, but this was not of sufficient magnitude to manifest in a detectable change in fat free mass (FFM) by dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) or muscle cross sectional area (CSA) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over a 6-week period. The body composition responses to the KDs were similar to those observed after a calorically matched low fat diet (LFD).  As expected, the KD elevated fasting Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) (mean 1.1 mM), which was augmented by addition of the KS (mean 1.4 mM) during the first 2 weeks of the intervention. Ketosis was achieved in as early as 3 days, similar to what we have reported before with implementation of a well-formulated KD (4).",846a9809-b4d4-4335-a5c5-2b209a91a98b
36,discussion2," It is important to point out that the fasting measures of Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) were all done in the morning after an overnight fast and at least 10 h following the ingestion of the last dose of KS the evening of the previous day. In keto-naïve people (fasting Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) 0.1–0.2 mM), the exact same KS and dose has previously been shown to result in a rapid increase in capillary Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) peaking at 1 mM after approximately 15 min and gradually returning to baseline by 2 h (34). Considering the transient nature of Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) elevation after consumption of the KS, the fact that we were able to detect higher fasting Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) 10–12 h later in the KD + KS group was somewhat unexpected.",dc3843a9-525f-4813-bbc4-aa0cb529c389
37,discussion3," The augmentation of fasting Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in response to exogenous ketones only lasted 2 weeks, suggesting that adaptations in the metabolic regulation of ketone homeostasis (e.g., Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) oxidation, renal clearance, etc.) occurred.  We hypothesized that augmentation of ketosis by twice daily ingestion of a KS might enhance preservation of lean mass in response to a hypocaloric KD that produced clinically meaningful weight loss, but results from our 6-week intervention suggest that was not the case. For every kilogram of fat free mass (FFM) lost, FM decreased between 2.3 and 2.5 kg, a ratio that is consistent with previously published KD studies (42).",9f3813c3-0b1a-485b-84f1-6d34936af964
38,discussion4," These results must be viewed with an understanding that dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) determines fluid loss as a decrease in fat free mass (FFM), and KDs are associated with initial loss of body water (22, 43). KDs have been shown to acutely reduce glycogen stores by 50% (44), which could account for nearly 1 kg of lean tissue. KDs are also associated with a natriuretic and diuretic effect that could lead to greater loss of fluid, especially if not counter-acted by increased sodium and fluid intake, again being reflected by increased loss of lean tissue. It is notable that the two KDs contained significantly different amounts of sodium due to the high sodium content of the KS (KD + PL = 2,351, KD + KS = 6,100 mg/day), yet this did not impact dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) determined fat free mass (FFM) responses.",96b58fb7-3fb6-4c71-ac26-6d56a5b2826e
39,discussion5," Furthermore, whole body fat free mass (FFM) analyses can be affected by the trunk area due to the presence of confounding organs in the region of interest, so appendicular regions, such as the thigh, have been used to circumvent this limitation in fat free mass (FFM) assessment (45). Given these limitations of dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) we also used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of thigh musculature, which demonstrated significant cross sectional area (CSA) reductions after 6 weeks in all mid-thigh muscle subdivisions starting in highest order from posterior, then medial, and least from the anterior compartment (p < 0.001). The aggregate between these three compartments was expressed as whole thigh cross sectional area (CSA) and corroborated with the significant fat free mass (FFM) reductions showed by dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) (p < 0.001).",08960c77-9aef-42d7-bf93-17086f67f2aa
40,discussion6," The differences between dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) expressed as a total percentage fat free mass (FFM) loss from baseline did not correlate significantly within KD + KS (r = 0.42; p = 0.20) or KD + PL (r = 0.26; p = 0.40). However, the correlation was significant within low fat diet (LFD) (r = 0.64; p = 0.025). The observed discrepancy with KD raises some caution in fat free mass (FFM) assessments after significant weight loss due to technological limitations. Nevertheless, our results suggest that KS inclusion does not significantly alter fat free mass (FFM) during a short-term KD that provides adequate protein.  In addition to imaging lean tissue, we measured markers of protein metabolism including Urine urea nitrogen (UUN) and 3MH, which may be more sensitive to change.",0c181836-b95e-41d1-b91b-0d60b2bc1f95
41,discussion7," The trend for lower Urine urea nitrogen (UUN) in the KD + KS group supports our initial hypothesis that the addition of a KS to a well-formulated KD may improve whole nitrogen turnover compared to PL (−8%), but the relatively low effect size casts doubt that there was a meaningful difference between the two ketogenic diets. It is noteworthy that the baseline 24 h urine collection started on the first day of the KD and also included two doses of the KS (i.e., UNN may have been influenced at baseline by exposure to the first two doses of KS). Thus, the group effect in this case is strengthened by the consistently lower Urine urea nitrogen (UUN) in KD + KS at baseline, WK2, WK4, and WK6 compared to KD + PL. However, the difference between baseline Urine urea nitrogen (UUN) values and WK6 trended toward significance (p = 0.073), and inclusion of low fat diet (LFD) in secondary statistical analyses showed that WK6 Urine urea nitrogen (UUN) was significantly lower than baseline (p < 0.05).",0eaf8b7c-2428-4f86-905f-83d792ae784b
42,discussion8," Secondary analyses also revealed that non-supplemented KDs may excrete more nitrogen than low fat diet (LFD) (p = 0.008). Others have demonstrated similar results by showing acute increases in nitrogen excretion (<2 weeks), followed by a prompt restoration of nitrogen balance thereafter explained by ketonemia maintenance (26, 44, 46–48). The trend for less nitrogen excretion with use of a KS is consistent with studies that demonstrate nitrogen balance improvements with Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) salts (9) and infusions (10). Some caution is warranted when comparing Urine urea nitrogen (UUN) and NBAL to fat free mass (FFM) measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA). Discrepancies in the NBAL formula can be attributed to both over- and underestimating rates of muscle protein synthesis, nitrogen clearance, unaccounted integumentary losses and fluid loss (49–51).",c90825e1-eda0-4e43-a119-3bb0588c9474
43,discussion9," Other authors used Urine urea nitrogen (UUN) and NBAL data to qualitatively support their diets rather than quantitatively correlate each gram of nitrogen lost to fat free mass (FFM) (1 g Urine urea nitrogen (UUN) ~30 g fat free mass (FFM)) to avoid erroneous conclusions (9, 49, 50). Longer interventions (>6 weeks) may be needed to accrue the benefits of enhanced nitrogen preservation that could be detected in better preservation of lean tissue as determined by conventional body composition and imaging technologies.  While Urine urea nitrogen (UUN) provides a global indication of nitrogen loss from a variety of proteins, circulating 3MH is a specific surrogate for actin and myosin degradation. Although we hypothesized higher levels of Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) might act in an anti-catabolic manner to decrease 3MH (9), our results did not confirm this response.",72c05ae2-d41c-492c-80fc-2f132bb9969d
44,discussion10," We speculate based on previous evidence that well-formulated KDs, especially ones that include exogenous Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB), can interact with essential AA (11, 52) and decrease essential AA efflux from muscle into circulation (10, 12, 15, 44). While some authors have previously shown that Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) does not always interact with AAs (13, 53), and others advise caution using plasma AA concentrations alone as evidence (11), these recommendations suggest that more work is needed to explore the efficacy of KS on AA catabolism during weight loss.  Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) inhibits adipose tissue lipolysis acting through PUMA-G receptors (54).",a960d925-c760-4e3b-b022-2d06a5392398
45,discussion11," Some human and rat studies have shown that intravenous D-Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) infusion or racemic salts decreased lipolysis (53, 55, 56), suggesting that use of KS could attenuate fat loss and affect body composition. However, the similar loss of whole-body fat from dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) and decreased visceral adipose tissue (VAT)/subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show no indication of KS impacting adiposity. Fat loss occurred at a similar rate, independent of the KS, which was expected given the caloric deficit was similar between all diets.",d107f556-2f68-474f-aa3c-4a2609804e7d
46,discussion12," We were motivated to expand on our dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) adipose tissue findings with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) after previous authors demonstrated higher instrument accuracy over dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA), particularly toward subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) measurements (38). magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the KS does not impact the normal loss of adipose tissue from visceral and subcutaneous depots in response to a KD. The decreased visceral adipose tissue (VAT)/subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) aligned with the changes in waist and hip circumference. There was a more rapid decrease in waist circumference with the KD than low fat diet (LFD), perhaps due to early loss of fluid, although similar to anthropometry findings of another controlled low-carbohydrate and low-fat comparison trial (57).",3d298400-5912-47aa-b4c4-5a34961d0bb9
47,discussion13,"  We attempted to standardize the caloric intake across all participants (i.e., 75% of their estimated energy needs for weight maintenance) to provide a similar relative caloric deficit between groups which was approximately 600 kcal/day. We acknowledge our methods of determining energy needs may have introduced error in determining both basal metabolic rate and physical activity correction factors, thereby contributing to variation in weight loss among participants. Since we relied on equations as opposed to more accurate methods (e.g., whole room calorimetry or doubly labeled water), it is possible we may have prescribed a >25% energy deficit (e.g., by underestimating physical activity level (PAL)). Even if this was the case, our approach was applied equally across all participants and should not have influenced the outcomes.",9a630458-2565-4283-abd0-1cfca9c15972
48,discussion14,"  Conclusions  In summary, results of our exploratory investigation suggests that inclusion of a KS to a well-formulated hypocaloric KD does not significantly alter weight loss or body composition responses compared to a calorie-matched isonitrogenous KD + PL. Thus, short-term changes in body composition during caloric restriction are driven by caloric restriction more so than level of ketosis or macronutrient distribution.
