0,introduction0,"Ketone bodies, including acetoacetate, acetone, and beta-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), are generated in a state of starvation, fasting, or high-fat diet. Ketogenic metabolism, commonly induced by ketogenic food and calorie restriction, has been used as a therapeutic alternative because of its neuroprotective effect in neurological diseases. It was proven to be effective in the clinical treatment of pharmaco-resistant epilepsy, especially in children . Furthermore, ketogenic metabolism presented a beneficial effect in Alzheimer’s disease , Parkinson’s disease , traumatic brain injury (Prins and Matsumoto, 2014; Wood et al., 2018), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Zhao et al., 2006; Caplliure-Llopis et al., 2019).  In recent years, studies regarding the application of ketogenic metabolism in spinal cord injury (spinal cord injury (SCI)) were reported.",e7b08307-f065-4d47-a358-105e3b9316c8
1,introduction1," Previously, we investigated the tolerance of ketogenic diet (KD) and detected the serum ketone body levels in 10 patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) in a clinical trial, thus confirming the safety and feasibility of KD . Yarar-Fisher et al. (2018) further proposed that KD has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, and could promote the recovery of neural function post-spinal cord injury (SCI). It was verified by Streijger et al. (2013) that KD was effective in promoting motor function, reducing the lesion area, and preserving greater spared gray matter after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats while Jeong et al. (2011) reported that fasting every other day, another form of ketogenic metabolism, was beneficial in protecting neural function and facilitating motor recovery.",282ee66b-b5d5-4d48-85dd-76e543de6ff9
2,introduction2," However, given the compliance of the patients, neither KD nor fasting every other day may be the best option, and may present challenges in clinical application because both require strict calorie restriction. Therefore, it is necessary to explore whether 1, 3-butanediol (BD), a ketone supplement that can promote the serum ketone level without interrupting normal diet , possesses a neuroprotective effect and thus can offer a therapeutic alternative for spinal cord injury (SCI).  The pathophysiological mechanism of spinal cord injury (SCI) is complex because an inflammatory response, oxidative stress, ischemic edema, hemorrhage, and hypoxia all occur in the secondary injury (Rogers and Todd, 2016). Our previous studies indicated that βOHB was the inhibitor of class I histone deacetylases and attenuated the oxidative stress post-spinal cord injury (SCI) .",6ea0774d-7def-4f28-9dd6-7a45ca077143
3,introduction3," Although, it was widely acknowledged that ketogenic metabolism acts through a combination of mechanisms (Boison, 2017), its role in regulating the inflammatory response, especially macrophage polarization, a crucial element of secondary pathology after spinal cord injury (SCI), remains to be clarified. It was reported that βOHB had an anti-inflammatory effect and inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, which could accelerate the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines . Activated macrophage would polarize into M1 and M2 sub-types and provided pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, respectively, in terms of the inflammatory response after central nerve system injury . Recently, a study by Huang C. et al.",af97fcf0-4373-464f-8aae-bef9c240766c
4,introduction4," (2018) showed that βOHB induced a functional ramification of murine microglia in vitro and in vivo, and that this ramification helped microglia to revert back to their tissue surveying and anti-inflammatory status in mice brain. However, we have been unable to locate any study conducted to evaluate the relation between ketogenic metabolism and macrophage polarization after spinal cord injury (SCI).  Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the neuroprotection of ketogenic metabolism, focusing on its effect on inhibiting an inflammatory response and regulating macrophage polarization post-spinal cord injury (SCI). Furthermore, this study investigates whether BD exerts a neuroprotective effect by regulating macrophage polarization.  ",cc3bed39-97ad-4171-b0f8-145ff5913bfd

Surgical Procedure and C5 Hemi-Contusion Injury A hemi-contusive C5 spinal cord injury (SCI) model with displacement control was used as described previously (Huang Z. et al., 2018). In brief, rats were anesthetized with 2–3% isoflurane in oxygen via a small animal anesthesia machine (VP1000; Matrix, United States), and injected subcutaneously with 5 ml normal saline to prevent dehydration during the procedure. Then, the rats were fixed to a stereotaxic apparatus (standard type; Ruiwode, China) in a prone position, shaved, and sterilized at the head and neck. A 100 g object was suspended from the tail to stretch the cervical spine. A 2.5-cm median incision in the back starting from C2 was conducted to expose the vertebral plate.",7a16078a-6870-4805-9a79-dbb2513bdd4f
8,methods3," After locating the C5 level, the muscle attachments and tissue of C3–C7 were cleaned, and the groove between the corresponding transverse processes and articular processes was exposed. Unilateral laminectomy was performed at the left side of C5 to expose the left side of the spinal cord, while the spinal dura remained intact. A custom clamp was mounted on the C4–C6 groove and then fixed to the stereotaxic apparatus to eliminate spinal cord movement caused by breathing. All surgical instruments underwent autoclave sterilization before operation, and the entire procedure was performed under an operating microscope (YH-X-4A; Zhenjiang Yihuaguang, China).  After laminectomy, and with a stereotaxic apparatus, the rat was transferred onto a custom frame that was tilted 22.5° and fixed on the x-y-z platform of an electromagnetic servo material testing machine (Instron E1000; Instron, United States) to perform a C5 hemi-contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) (as shown in Figure 1).

A vibration program was initiated to determine the initial position of the contusion. Then, an impact program was triggered to drive the impactor to contuse the left side of the C5 spinal cord with a set displacement of 1.5 mm at 100 mm/s. The real-time speed, displacement, and force were recorded. After contusion, the muscle and skin were sutured layer by layer, and the incision was sterilized again. Penicillin (10,000 U) was injected intramuscularly to prevent infection. The rats were placed in 37°C incubators until anesthesia recovery and then transferred to the ordinary cage.

The images were analyzed with the ImageJ software (v.1.48; Rawak Software, Germany).  Behavioral Evaluations Behavioral evaluations were conducted at pre-injury and at every 2 weeks post-injury (wpi) for 12 weeks, including grooming test, rearing test, and Montoya’s staircase test. Briefly, the grooming test was used to evaluate the rat’s forelimb function. Cold water was applied on the head and neck to wet the rat’s fur. Then, the rat was placed in a clear Plexiglas cylinder (20 cm diameter, 46 cm height). Two mirrors (50 cm × 60 cm) were placed perpendicularly to each other behind the cylinder, so that the movement details could be clearly assessed from multiple angles. Each rat was videotaped for 15 min.",6ba937d4-8193-4481-84aa-9c176b1914d5
15,methods10," The grooming movement was scored by a non-experimenter by referring to the video frame by frame. Different scores were marked if the forelimbs reached different areas of the face and head: score 1 referred to the area below the lips; score 2 referred to the area between the lips and nose; score 3 referred to the area between the nose and eyes; score 4 referred to the area between the eyes and ears; score 5 referred to movement whereby the forelimbs could flatten the root of the ear in a direction from back to forward. Five sets of independent grooming movements were evaluated for each rat and scored respectively for each side of the forelimbs. The highest score of each side was selected as the final score of that side. The typical grooming movement is shown in Figure 2A.

The staircase contained six steps, where each one was independent between the left and right sides. Each step contained a shallow well, filled with four sugar pills. The rat could only enter the staircase from one side, and the left or right forelimb could only grasp the food on the left or right steps, respectively. Rats were fasted for 12 h before the test to enhance motivation. In the formal experiment, rats were placed in the staircase for 15 min under a dark and quiet environment. The exact number and position of the remanent sugar pills were recorded at the end for both sides. The typical food grasping movement is shown in Figure 2C.

34,discussion0,"The present study investigated the neuroprotection of ketone metabolism, including KD and BD, after cervical spinal cord hemi-contusion in rats. The results indicated that ketone metabolism induced by KD presented benefit in terms of the improvement of motor function and the reservation of spinal gray matter after spinal cord injury (SCI). Such neuroprotective effect might be related to regulation of the inflammatory response and to the inhibition of M1 and promotion of M2 macrophage polarization. However, ketone metabolism induced by BD regulated the macrophage polarization and inflammatory response without motor function improvement.  A hemi-contusive cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) model with displacement control was used in the present study. The displacement and speed were the set parameters, and the maximum variation of actual displacement and speed was less than 1.2%.",9e790b71-eaaf-41df-a093-8387354069d8
35,discussion1," As an unset parameter, the peak force showed no significant difference between the injury groups, suggesting that the severity of injury in this model was highly consistent and thus applicable for subsequent intervention.  At the early stage post-spinal cord injury (SCI), the weight of the animals temporarily dropped because of a sharp decrease in exercise and food intake. After adapting to the pathological state, the weight gradually recovered as food consumption increased. In addition, the satiety caused by gavage in the BD group also led to a decrease in food intake, so that the weight in the BD group was slightly lighter than the others. Compared with the SD group, the KD and BD groups did not present apparent hypoglycemia. However, the serum glucose of the KD and BD groups was slightly lower than the SD group, and the KD group was the lowest.",e4508d9c-8cad-4e04-85f2-084cb5164ebf
36,discussion2," This was probably because the unlimited supply of ketogenic food resulted in a more complete ketone metabolism in the KD group, and thus the glycometabolism was reduced. Because of the process of gluconeogenesis in the body, however, no obvious hypoglycemia was observed. This phenomenon is consistent with the results of our previous clinical trial . The changes of serum ketone in the two treatment groups were different. After gavage of BD, the serum ketone in the BD group reached a stable level in a short time, and plateaued earlier than the KD group. The serum ketone in the KD group rose slowly, but peaked at a higher value, and then decreased and plateaued at a similar level to the BD group. This phenomenon likely resulted from the different mechanism of intervention. For the BD group, the frequency of gavage was once a day, without interruption of normal diet.",eda4bb3b-d42b-4f16-b55c-02968ee68498
37,discussion3," There was no timely supplement after the BD was absorbed and metabolized in the liver, and thus the ketone level in the systemic circulation was limited. However, the management of BD gavage ensured the ketone level during the first few days post-spinal cord injury (SCI). This was of significance in the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) as an early intervention. As for the KD group, standard food was replaced with ketogenic food, without intake limitation. Therefore, serum ketone accumulated gradually after metabolism, and then re-balanced and fluctuated at a certain level when the animal accommodated the ketone metabolism. The changes in ketone levels caused by ketogenic food and BD were inconsistent at the early stage, but similar at the middle and late stages of intervention. Therefore, it was necessary to compare the effect of this difference on spinal cord injury (SCI).",6ca8e673-e571-4685-b65c-09cc45b86541
38,discussion4,"  The inflammatory response, in which macrophage is crucial for the process, is one of the important characteristics of secondary spinal cord injury (SCI). Under the effect of chemokines, monocyte migrates into the spinal cord from circulation and differentiates into macrophage. Then, the macrophage begins to gather in and around the injury site at 3 dpi. The number of macrophages peaks at 7 dpi, and then slightly decreases, before it begins to rise again at 14 dpi, and peaks a second time at 60 dpi . Previous study indicated that facilitating the polarization of macrophage into the M2 sub-type had a beneficial effect on the repair of central nervous system injury . Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that the ketone body metabolite, βOHB, could activate the differentiation of microglia into the M2 sub-type, exert an anti-inflammation effect in the nervous system, and reduce depression-like behavior (Huang C. et al., 2018).",53385e17-5364-4cd1-8431-5ab2f331291f
39,discussion5," The results of the present study showed that compared with the control group, the KD and BD effectively reduced the expression of iNOS, one of protein markers of M1 macrophage, while promoting the expression of Arg-1, one of the protein markers of M2 macrophage. It is suggested that ketone metabolism induced by these two methods could affect the polarization process of microglia/macrophage in spinal cord tissue. To be specific, the ketone metabolism inhibits the M1 and enhances M2 macrophage polarization.  Inflammatory cytokine can directly reflect the inflammatory response after spinal cord injury (SCI). TNF-α and IL-1β are commonly used to simulate in vitro aseptic inflammation to induce the polarization of M1 macrophage. Both factors are highly expressed in the spinal cord post-trauma. The results of the present study suggest that ketone metabolism tended to reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines after spinal cord injury (SCI).",9a057f7a-9e5d-4706-b224-1ca3ae1fee22
40,discussion6," The gene and protein expression of TNF-α were suppressed significantly. The protein expression of IL-1β and gene expression of IL-6 also tended to be inhibited in rats of both the KD and BD groups, indicating that ketone metabolism can regulate the inflammatory response in spinal cord tissue.  Our results also indicate that KD improved the motor function following acute spinal cord injury (SCI). The rearing and grooming tests reflected the motor function of the large joint of forelimbs in rats, while the Montoya’s staircase test reflected the skilled reaching function of the fore paws. The rats fed with ketogenic food had a higher usage of the ipsilateral forelimb in the rearing test than rats from other groups after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, no apparent improvement on skilled reaching presented in the KD group, indicating that ketone metabolism had a more significant effect on the recovery of large joint movement after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats.",4ea3cbf5-42f9-46b4-b4d1-857489e96ab1
41,discussion7," There was no improvement on the behavioral evaluations in rats gavaged with BD, possibly because the serum ketone level of the BD group did not rise as high as the KD group in the first few weeks post-spinal cord injury (SCI), which is a crucial period in which to conduct efficient treatments to improve serum ketone to a certain level. On the other hand, it might be because the gavage imposed a negative influence on behaviors, leaving less enthusiasm for movement in rats. Interestingly, the study of Streijger et al. (2013) showed that KD was effective in improving both the motor function of large joints and skilled reaching, whereas the KD only benefited the former in our study, although this might be due to the different contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) models in the two studies, where Streijger et al. (2013) used the force-controlled contusion model with an Infinite Horizon impactor, while a displacement-controlled contusion model was adopted in our study.",0bf47426-2594-4449-86a6-a0822113ef03
42,discussion8," These two models might result in inconsistent severity of injury and have different effects after the treatment intervention.  It was indicated in the present study that KD increased the spared gray matter at the spinal cord epicenter when compared with the control group. However, the rats of the BD group did not show such results. Moreover, the beneficial effect of ketone metabolism induced by the two methods was limited in reducing the lesion area at the epicenter, as well as in reserving the spared white matter at the ipsilateral side. The gray matter of the spinal cord is the site where neurons gather, and the survival of neurons is critical for the improvement of motor function after spinal cord injury (SCI). The neuroprotective effect of ketone metabolism has been verified in the field of neuroscience, with Cheng et al. (2009) finding that KD could resist the neurotoxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine and protect dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra in the Parkinson’s disease model.",e2225348-7a98-4635-82bf-a290ed519b6b
43,discussion9," Kashiwaya et al. (2000) proposed that during the in vitro culture of midbrain neurons and hippocampal neurons, the addition of 4 mM d-gab-hydroxybutyrate could protect neurons from the toxic effects of heroin analogs (MPP1) and amyloid protein (Aβ1–42), which are important risk factors in Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, respectively. In terms of spinal cord injury (SCI), Guo et al. (2015) observed that musk ketone reduced the neuronal degeneration and necrosis in spinal cord tissue at 7 dpi in rats. In our study, the result of the behavioral evaluation in the KD group was superior to the other two groups, whereas it was consistent with the result of histological evaluation in which the KD group presented with greater spared gray matter. These results support the view that KD-induced ketone metabolism has a protective effect on neurons.  There were limitations in this study.",e9ad7a99-753d-4d02-87dd-74df536dec41
44,discussion10," First, no behavioral improvement was observed in the BD gavage group, as a gradient dose of BD was not considered in the present study. We suppose that a higher dose of BD could promote the behavioral outcomes. Thus, the optimal dose of BD, especially at the early stage of spinal cord injury (SCI), should be addressed in future study. Second, although the iNOS and Arg-1 are primarily expressed in M1 and M2 macrophage, respectively, they could also exist in other cells of the central nerve systems and be upregulated by spinal cord pathology. For example, Arg-1 was detected in both macrophage and reactive astrocytes after spinal cord injury (SCI) , whereas iNOS was expressed in microglial cells, astrocytes, and neurons, especially in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models (Sonar and Lal, 2019). Therefore, the multiple cell types expressing iNOS and Arg-1 may interfere with the interpretation of the Western blot results.",9b87db70-4679-422d-996d-8a81acfca31e
45,discussion11,"  Conclusion The present study indicates that both KD and BD effectively increase the serum ketone level post-spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats, in which the effect works earlier in BD, while being stronger and longer lasting in KD. Both treatments inhibit the expression of inflammatory cytokines and may regulate the macrophage polarization to the M2 sub-type. Moreover, ketone metabolism induced by KD, rather than by BD, seems to have a beneficial effect on the improvement of motor function and on the reservation of spared gray matter after spinal cord injury (SCI).
