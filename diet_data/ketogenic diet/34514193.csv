0,introduction0," Epileptic spasms (previously called infantile spasms) is an early-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterised by clusters of epileptic spasms, often associated with severe developmental and neurological outcomes.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Epileptic spasms is estimated to affect 1 in 5000 children6 with diverse structural and genetic causes,7, 8, 9, 10 however the aetiology in 40% of epileptic spasms patients remains unknown (previously termed idiopathic or cryptogenic).11 Improved understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms of epileptic spasms, and biomarkers to identify the underlying aetiology are of great importance.12  Clinical observations have reported the sites of spasm generation are a result of interactions between the cortical and brain stem neural networks.13,14 Positron emission tomography (Positron emission tomography (PET)) studies have reported significant abnormalities of hypometabolism in the cortex.15,16  Metabolites are crucial biomarkers of cellular function.",55bd50fa-e5ac-4275-9adb-601544eddcdb
1,introduction1," A growing body of evidence shows the tryptophan pathway is implicated in the pathophysiology of epileptic seizures.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 The kynurenine pathway (KP) is the main catabolic pathway of tryptophan (tryptophan (TRP)) (Figure 1). Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), the first enzyme of the KP, is activated by various inflammatory mediators, and converts tryptophan (TRP) to kynurenine (kynurenine (KYN)). kynurenine (KYN) is then metabolised into different branches by three main enzymes: kynurenine aminotransferase (kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT)), kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (kynurenine 3 monooxygenase (KMO)) and kynureninase, leading to the formation of kynurenic acid (kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A)), 3-hydroxykynruenine (3-HK) and anthranilic acid (AA) respectively (Figure 1).",766197ea-675b-401c-9869-db83ab44e379
2,introduction2," 3-hydroxykynurenine is further converted to 3-hydroxyanthanthranilic acid (3-HAA) and into quinolinic acid (quinolinic acid (QUIN)) by the consecutive activity of enzymes kynureninase and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase.23,24 AA can be also converted to 3-HAA through an oxidation-reduction reaction.25 Several intermediates in the tryptophan pathway such as kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) and quinolinic acid (QUIN) have biological involvement in neurotransmission, inflammation, immune responses and neurodegeneration, and alterations in these metabolites have been reported in various neurological diseases.26, 27, 28 For example, kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A), produced by astrocytes, has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties (a glutamate receptor antagonist), whereas quinolinic acid (QUIN), produced by activated microglia, is neurotoxic.",bb075db3-a687-41f5-ba2c-b227cd040884

4,background0," Epileptic (previously infantile) spasms is the most common epileptic encephalopathy occurring during infancy and is frequently associated with abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes. Epileptic spasms have a diverse range of known (genetic, structural) and unknown aetiologies. High dose corticosteroid treatment for 4 weeks often induces remission of spasms, although the mechanism of action of corticosteroid is unclear. Animal models of epileptic spasms have shown decreased brain kynurenic acid, which is increased after treatment with the ketogenic diet. We quantified kynurenine pathway metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) of infants with epileptic spasms and explored clinical correlations.

35,discussion0," We investigated the levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) KP metabolites in a cohort of epileptic spasms. The main limitation of our cohort was the absence of tuberous sclerosis complex (tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)) which is described in 5.7% of a large Chinese epileptic spasms cohort (n=541)36 and 7.2% of a UK cohort (n=207).35 Two patients presented with spasms due to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) during our study period, but they did not have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, possibly because tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is often diagnosed on skin examination and MRI neuroimaging, and therefore cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was not considered necessary. Other than tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), our epileptic spasms cohort was representative of the most tertiary epileptic spasms cohorts in proportions of known and unknown aetiology.",44380357-468d-4073-a25b-e099a1aee3b0
36,discussion1,"  In the present study, we report a significantly lower kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) in epileptic spasms compared to other non inflammatory neurological diseases (OND). The direct precursor-product ratio is commonly used to infer enzymatic activity, and we demonstrate statistically unchanged kynurenine (KYN)/tryptophan (TRP) ratio, but a significantly decreased kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A)/kynurenine (KYN) ratio in epileptic spasms compared to other non-inflammatory neurological controls. The kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A)/kynurenine (KYN) ratio was lower in all epileptic spasms subgroups, both known and unknown aetiology.  Previous studies have shown that kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) has neuroprotective, anticonvulsant and anti-inflammatory properties,40,41 and acts as an endogenous antagonist of the N-methyl-D aspartate and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, blocking excitotoxic insults and apoptotic processes.",c4743cfa-3516-4a67-aff2-05e0ee3ac012
37,discussion2,"40, 41, 42 Therefore, a decreased kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) could result in a pro-convulsant and neurotoxic state. There are very few cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies in epileptic spasms, and our results are in line with the current small literature showing decreased concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A).30,31,34 kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) does not cross the blood-brain barrier due to its polar structure and is mostly produced by astrocytes by the kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) enzymes.23 It has been reported that a decrease in the kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A)/kynurenine (KYN) ratio is associated with reduction of kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) enzyme activity.43,44 Vitamin B6 in the form of pyridoxal 5′ phosphate (PLP) is a cofactor that influences the catabolism of tryptophan (TRP) (Figure 1).",4c083d10-ab3f-4f5d-be4c-1d260d44ed4f
38,discussion3,"45,46 As pyridoxal 5′ phosphate (PLP) is a cofactor for kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) activity (which metabolises kynurenine (KYN) to kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A)), we measured pyridoxal 5′ phosphate (PLP) in a subgroup of patients and controls but found no evidence of pyridoxal 5′ phosphate (PLP) deficiency in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children with epileptic spasms, and no correlation with kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A)/kynurenine (KYN) ratio. We hypothesised that, as in the rodent model of epileptic spasms,47 there could be IDO1 activation due to inflammation. However, we could find little evidence of current active neuroinflammation using recognised immune biomarkers such as cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, the biological trigger activating and dysregulating the KP in epileptic spasms is still unknown, although preceding neuroinflammation and/or microbiome dysbiosis (see below) remain plausible.",23a356d0-db80-4367-9ad0-63620ff8cb91
39,discussion4,"  The current recommended standard first-line treatments for epileptic spasms are adrenocorticotropic hormone or oral corticosteroids and/or vigabatrin.1,3,4,48 There is strong evidence that high dose corticosteroids is highly effective in inducing spasm remission, and the United Kingdom infantile spasms study (UKISS) protocol now recommends oral prednisolone, starting at 10 mg four times per day.3 It is our practise to adopt the United Kingdom infantile spasms study (UKISS) prednisolone protocol and we do not use ACTH any longer. Previously, it was perceived that corticosteroids were more effective in idiopathic or cryptogenic cases (now collectively called unknown aetiology), whereas vigabatrin was more effective in symptomatic cases, including tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) complex. A recent RCT showed that combining both oral prednisolone and vigabatrin is superior to oral prednisolone alone in inducing spasm remission.",edf756f3-a5ce-4472-a57b-b6330d3dbfb9
40,discussion5,"3 Although delayed treatment can worsen neurological outcomes, the use of combined corticosteroid plus vigabatrin does not improve long term outcomes compared to prednisolone alone.5 At present, it seems the long-term outcomes are predominantly dictated by the underlying aetiology, and there are no ‘disease modifying medications’ that alter long term trajectories for epileptic spasms, to date.  The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and adequate-protein diet also used to treat seizures including epileptic spasms, with international best practice guidelines recommending consideration of the diet early in treatment course of epileptic spasms.49,50 Interestingly, a recent study reported that the ketogenic diet is equally as effective as adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment for epileptic spasms, and with less adverse effects.",ef9e14f9-7786-4549-afb6-91a7ec4ee539
41,discussion6,"51 More recent evidence has demonstrated that the KD affects plasma kynurenine (KYN) metabolites in children with refractory epilepsy,52 and the KD resulted an increase in kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) levels, and significantly increase in the kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A)/kynurenine (KYN) plasma ratio.52 An animal model of brain injury with refractory epileptic spasms (intractable to conventional anti-convulsants), showed reduced hippocampal kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A), which was normalised following KD treatments and associated with the remission of epileptic spasms.47 Mu et al. demonstrated that antibiotics (minocycline, an IDO1 inhibitor) also reduced spasms, increased the effectiveness of the ketogenic diet, and elevated hippocampal kynurenic acid.",07296659-25c4-4d24-bca9-59a5019e450a
42,discussion7,"47 This spasms animal model showed that the microbiome was a key mediator of this effect, as transplanting faeces from animals treated with KD into animals with ongoing epileptic spasms was effective in reducing the seizures. These prior observations, in conjunction with our findings, support the concept that the downregulation of kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) may be a key player in the pathogenesis of epileptic spasms, and therapeutics that increase kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) could be neuroprotective and improve epilepsy and neurodevelopmental outcomes in epileptic spasms.  In our cohort, the unknown aetiology epileptic spasms subgroup generally responded rapidly to steroids, and had better epilepsy and neurodevelopmental outcomes than patients with known aetiologies (Table 1 and supplementary Table 1), as previous described.",45a0dfad-5759-41d2-9c08-a753cb1f7fcb
43,discussion8,"53, 54, 55 Although the neurodevelopmental outcomes were less severe in the unknown aetiology subgroup, only two of 15 unknown aetiology epileptic spasms children were considered normal at follow-up, and the follow-up duration was too short to confidently detect milder learning issues. In our study, the kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A)/kynurenine (KYN) ratio was low in all epileptic spasms subgroups. However, the children who responded to steroids fully or partially had lower kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A)/kynurenine (KYN) ratio than patients who were refractory to steroids. Therefore, we propose that the kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A)/kynurenine (KYN) ratio holds promise as a potential biomarker of epileptic spasms, and also response to steroid therapy.  There was an elevation of anthranilic acid and xanthurenic acid in the epileptic spasms cohort, although these findings were not significant after Bonferroni correction (Supplementary Table 6).",2f878351-3527-4af7-80d8-aa94ac1218e8
44,discussion9," However, these metabolites could be worthy of future research in this context.  Due to the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A), there has been interest in supplementing tryptophan (TRP) or kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) in some neurological diseases, including emerging clinical trials targeting the KP in neurological diseases such as chronic pain and multiple sclerosis.56 As tryptophan (TRP) is predominantly sourced from food and gut metabolism, nutritional therapeutics or microbiome manipulation has been a focus of attention. There is interest in foods enriched with kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A), such as breast milk (20 times more kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) than formula milk), honey, or broccoli.",005834c1-75c0-4a99-b86c-7686963a3f7d
45,discussion10,"57,58 However, kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) is not permeable across the blood-brain barrier, although its precursor L-Kynurenine sulfate is permeable, and could be a therapeutic route to elevate brain kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) concentrations.28 Given the fact the KD elevates kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A), the application of KD in epileptic spasms warrants further attention. We believe that the positive correlation between tryptophan (TRP) and kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) (Figure 4) in the epileptic spasms patients supports the hypothesis that dietary modification of tryptophan (TRP) may optimise kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) levels.  Finally, given that kynurenic acid (kynurenine (KYN)A) is a glutamate antagonist, we hypothesise that alternative glutamate antagonists such as amantadine could be useful, as has been used empirically in some epilepsies.",84348636-b4b1-4c2f-ae3c-127c95e714e2
46,discussion11,"59 Additionally, clinically approved glutamate receptor antagonists such as felbamate,60 topiramate,61 phenobarbital62,63 and perampanel64 have been reported to reduce seizures and show some potential as therapeutic approaches to epileptic syndromes including epileptic spasms. In addition, studies have demonstrated memantine significantly improves cognition65 and neurodevelopmental outcomes in epileptic patients.66  Limitations  Firstly, our metabolite panel was limited to the KP, and there may be other unidentified metabolite biomarkers of epileptic spasms. Future untargeted metabolomics and proteomics studies in epileptic spasms may identify new discriminative biomarkers.  Secondly, future studies should perform combined analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood and urine (and stool) samples in order to identify the origins of these metabolite changes.",3a862f75-a4b8-4312-8699-78c24c50afe7
47,discussion12," The less invasive and accessible nature of blood and urine metabolic markers would be beneficial in monitoring response to treatments. Further studies on pre and post steroid treatment for KP metabolite comparisons are required to understand the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes in responders and non-responders to treatments.  Thirdly, not all of the children in our cohort had comprehensive genetic studies, and we may have missed some children with an underlying genetic aetiology. A further limitation was that our study was conducted in a retrospective manner, resulting in a non-standardised mode of investigation, treatment and follow-up. However, the follow-up and aetiology findings over time were accessible and documented by the treating neurologists who performed clinical phenotyping and aetiological associations independently of the laboratory metabolomic analysis.",1d201ff7-a727-4f20-8742-6f4f5cb6f2e2
48,discussion13," The documentation on the timing of presentation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collections relative to spasm onset, and drugs given at the time of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling are important factors that can influence the KP.  Fourthly, the subgroups in the epileptic spasms cohort were of modest size, which resulted in potential statistical power problems in analysis of the subgroups. And as discussed above, although we believe our cohort is comparable to large aetiological cohorts in terms of genetic, symptomatic and unknown subgroups,35,36 the absence of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) was a limitation of our cohort.  Finally, our study also did not examine microbiome characteristics or metabolism, which is a limitation given the recent animal models implicating the microbiome in reducing epileptic spasms.47  Conclusion  Early diagnosis of epileptic spasms is of paramount importance to ensure rapid treatments and improved clinical care.",2d1d5081-436c-45ac-8067-3b39db865594
49,discussion14," We provide evidence that kynurenic acid and the kynurenine metabolism is altered in epileptic spasms, which supports animal model evidence of the role of the KP in epileptic spasms. Our findings support the concept that therapeutics that effect KP, such as ketogenic diet, could have neuroprotective effects and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes. Future research in combined tissue (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/blood/urine/stool) analysis, and untargeted metabolomics to identify novel biomarkers are required.  Contributors  J.
