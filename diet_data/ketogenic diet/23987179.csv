0,introduction0,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)) is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease, with a lifetime risk of 1 in 2000 [1] and a worldwide incidence of 1–3 new cases per 100,000 individuals [2]. Symptoms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) include spasticity, hyperreflexia, generalized weakness, fasciculations, muscle atrophy, and paralysis resulting in impaired respiratory function [3], [4]. Ultimately, this leads to death within 3–5 years of onset, most commonly from respiratory failure [3].  The causes of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are poorly understood: only 10% of the cases are inherited (familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), fAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)), and only 20% of these cases have been definitively linked to mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene [5], [6]. The majority of the cases are sporadic (sAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), [7]), and the causes are largely unknown.",210e899b-bf61-49e5-bc05-638b1308d24b
1,introduction1," Regardless of the type of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), patients exhibit neuronal cell death, which may be caused by excess glutamate and oxidative stress-induced metabolic dysfunction [8], [9]. Pathological hallmarks of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) include mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, [10], [11], proteinopathy, glutaminergic dysregulation, metabolic dysregulation, and motor neuron death [9]. These disrupted cellular functions represent discrete targets for therapies that may ameliorate disease progression.  Evidence suggests that the histopathological and biochemical hallmarks of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) result from impaired energy metabolism [12]. Previous work reported by Zhao et al.",45ab4c5d-8ec0-4b58-bd24-4e79dc636f59
2,introduction2," [3] has shown that a ketogenic diet (KD) or caprylic triglyceride [4] stalls the impairment of motor function and reduces death of motor neurons in the spinal cord of transgenic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) mice (SOD1-G93A) by restoring energy metabolism through ketone body utilization. These transgenic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) mice express mutant forms of the human SOD1 gene and multiple copies of the wild type (wt) human SOD1 gene; therefore, this mouse model is frequently used for studying the progression and mechanism of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis [7], [13]. Under normal conditions, glucose is the primary metabolic fuel for the cells. However, alternative fuels such as ketone bodies or TCA cycle intermediates can potentially bypass the rate-limiting steps associated with impaired neuronal glucose metabolism and restore mitochondrial ATP production.",675203b2-ae8f-4785-ae72-ab747ba4ba6f
3,introduction3," Indeed, metabolic therapies such as therapeutic ketosis have been shown to effectively treat or alleviate symptoms of neurological disorders associated with aberrant energy metabolism, such as epilepsy, even in the presence of a persistent molecular pathology [14], [15]. In addition, coenzyme Q [16], creatine [17] and other metabolic intermediates were found to be effective against neuronal damage induced by excitotoxicity and mitochondrial inhibition.  Anecdotal reports from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients describe symptomatic improvement in motor control following administration of the supplement component of the Deanna Protocol (DP, personal communications, Data S1). The DP is comprised primarily of arginine alpha-ketoglutarate (arginine alpha ketoglutarate (AAKG)), and includes a number of other agents that were reported to preserve metabolic function and prevent glutamate excitotoxicity.",73f55e91-3820-460e-8d46-fa682d377dc4
4,introduction4," The anecdotal reports in patients and existing data in animal models [3], [4] support the investigation of metabolic therapy for the management and treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).  Based on previous research linking Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) pathology to metabolic dysfunction and anecdotal reports from patients, we hypothesized that supplying anaplerotic substrates and cofactors that are the primary ingredients of the DP, alone or in combination with a KD, would help to preserve metabolic function, alleviate Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) symptoms, and extend survival in an animal model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Our goal was to reverse or slow disease progression by supporting mitochondrial function and supplying alternative energy sources for neurons and glial cells.  ",baa42c70-5e10-4982-91dd-802b14af30bc

21,discussion0,"This study demonstrated that the Deanna Protocol (DP) supplementation added to a standard or ketogenic rodent diet improved motor function, delayed neurological deficits, and extended survival in SOD1-G93A mouse model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The major findings of the study show that during disease progression the SD+DP mice demonstrated improved motor function on rotarod, grip test, and PaGE test compared to control animals. Furthermore, the KD+DP and SD+DP groups exhibited longer survival times than the SD group.  Mouse model Reports vary regarding the onset of symptoms in this Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) model. Some studies report the onset of the symptoms at approximately day 90 [13] while other studies rather report day 60 [19], [20]. Hayworth [21] observed motor deficits during open field test from day 43 while Ligon [22] reported decreased grip strength at day 50.",77c4be9c-b781-4250-9512-5d5686405a9f
22,discussion1," At 56 days, treadmill and inclined plane deficits have been noted [23], [24], while motor deficits detected were reported at day 60 by Mancuso [25]. Based on rotarod performance, our study showed that motor function started to decline around day 84; however several mice exhibited neurological signs as early as day 72. In summary, we observed neurological and motor signs of disease progression along similar timelines to others using the SOD1-G93A Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) mouse model, so our results can reasonably be compared with those available in the literature.  Motor function improvement The central hypothesis of this study was that by supplying additional metabolic substrates to compromised cells and mitochondria, we could stall disease progression and improve both motor performance and survival time. The main ingredient of the DP is arginine alpha ketoglutarate (AAKG), which is a salt of the amino acid arginine and alpha-ketoglutaric acid.",c4abfb0f-78e5-4d79-8a36-e104bae6b079
23,discussion2," These components are believed to promote enhanced blood flow, greater muscle protein synthesis and improve muscle strength by delivering AKG, a TCA cycle intermediate. Medium-chain triglycerides (medium chain triglyceride (MCT)) were also added to the DP supplement and may serve a similar function as the arginine alpha ketoglutarate (AAKG). Namely, since medium chain triglyceride (MCT)s do not require carnitine for oxidation and easily pass through the mitochondrial membrane, they can readily be metabolized to produce acetyl-CoA (also oxidized by way of the TCA cycle) or further converted to the ketone bodies, β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. We speculate that incorporating these intermediates in the diet may have ameliorated some symptoms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) by directly providing energy substrates, and thus bypassing rate-limiting steps of glucose transport or metabolism (e.g. pyruvate dehydrogenase), which may have been compromised by the disease [26], [27].",69743efd-3999-4d41-9373-2f12193acc02
24,discussion3," This may salvage motor neurons and underlie the observed improvements in motor performance. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that nutritional ketosis with KD or medium chain triglyceride (MCT)s have been shown to increase physical endurance in mouse models of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) [3], [4] and are widely used in athletics to prolong endurance.  Anecdotal reports from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients taking the Deanna Protocol supplement complex describe improvement in mobility, strength and gait or slowed progression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)-related motor impairments (personal communications). Mice in our study that were fed with KD or the DP supplement showed better motor performance similar to what was found in previous studies [3], [4]. From these results it is clear that elevated blood ketone levels enhances motor performance, but is not sufficient for extending survival in this model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).",bafc6626-824a-4895-b680-0425d8d09fca
25,discussion4," Zhao et al [4] reported that caprylic triglyceride-fed mice showed about a 2.5 fold increase in the blood concentration of circulating ketones compared to animals on control diet, while in the present study we found only a moderate blood ketone level elevation compared to the control diet, which likely led to a less prominent motor function improvement in KD and KD+DP groups.  The Deanna Protocol also contains Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter that regulates neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system, and is directly responsible for the regulation of muscle tone [28]. In healthy animals, dietary Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier BBB and may be broken down by digestive enzymes. In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), however, the BBB is leaky, which may allow Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) to cross directly into the brain from the circulation [29], [30], [31].",427922b9-c1c1-401f-8d9b-0f220620b9fe
26,discussion5," Furthermore, the Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogue used in this study is conjugated with a 6-carbon ring, which makes it lipid soluble and allows it to pass directly through the BBB [32]. Thus, it is likely that dietary Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) was able to directly affect neuronal excitability in this study. Reduced excitability may underlie the improved motor control observed in the SD+DP group, though it is not clear why the KD+DP group apparently did not benefit from its addition.  Ubiquinol was added to the DP supplement since it is an essential component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria, thereby supporting mitochondrial function and ATP production. Although the amount used was small relative to the other components, the dose was 200–300 mg/kg in mice eating an average of 4–6 g/day, which has been proven effective for enhancing exercise capacity and suppression of oxidative stress [33], [34].",04f3a39c-99fd-443c-9040-38fe9e357ebf
27,discussion6," medium chain triglyceride (MCT)s have also been shown to increase physical endurance in humans and in mouse models of disease [35], [36], including Alzheimer’s [37] and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) [4]. In recent years, medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil and coconut oil have come into popular use for people with Alzheimer’s disease, other dementias, Parkinson’s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and other neurodegenerative diseases in which there is impaired glucose metabolism in the affected areas of the brain and/or peripheral nervous system [4], [38], [39]. The goal of such treatments is to deliver alternate metabolic substrates that bypass the problem (impaired glucose transport and insulin resistance) and may restore metabolic function in glucose-starved cells.",44300a41-b9d9-41c7-928e-97126277f1fb
28,discussion7,"  Extended survival To date, the only therapy offered to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients to extend survival is riluzole, which offers only a modest (2–3 months) extension of survival in some patients, and has considerable side effects [6]. Therefore, studies on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) transgenic mice are crucial to test potential therapies that not only improve motor function, but extend survival, especially if anecdotal reports in humans suggest a therapeutic effect. Interestingly, although we observed an increase in survival for the SD+DP and the KD+DP groups, this effect has not been observed by others using therapies that target energy metabolism [3], [4]. These results support further research, since increased motor function adds to improved quality of life, and extension of survival time is a primary clinical goal for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients.",430da796-f5e3-4dba-9066-12bde5022408
29,discussion8,"  Primary site of toxicity It is unclear whether the primary site of toxicity in the SOD1-G93A mice is in the skeletal muscle [40] or the motor neurons [41], but it is likely that the mutated toxic form of SOD1 is expressed in more tissue types [2]. Therefore, supporting the mitochondrial function of many cell types is a desirable therapeutic approach.  Recent studies have shown that even a complete rescue of motor neuron cell bodies does not cure mSOD1 mice [42], [43], [44] suggesting that preserving the normal function of motor neuron cells is therapeutically not sufficient, since the rescued motor neurons are unable to recreate destroyed neuromuscular junctions (neuromuscular junctions (NMJ)) [2]. Other attempts that rescue only motor neurons have also failed to halt progression [45]. The primary site of mSOD1 toxicity is likely to be represented in several other cell types, such as glial cells (astrocytes, microglia, or Schwann cells) and muscle fibers [2].",611df83c-27af-458a-9df3-5095171b7483
30,discussion9," Recent study shows that astrocytes expressing mSOD1 were able to trigger motor neuron death through a mechanism involving oxidative stress and NGF production [46]. Other studies showed similar results suggesting that the astrocyte could be a site of mSOD1 toxicity [47], [48]. Indeed, decreasing mSOD1 expression in astrocytes also delayed disease onset in mSOD1 mice [49]. Other studies highlight the importance of the interdependence between neurons and astroglial cells. A recent study shows improvement in motor function and survival after using dichloroacetate (dichloroacetate (DCA)) to treat astrocytes from SOD1-G93A mice [50]. dichloroacetate (DCA) is a well-characterized inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (activating PDH), enhancing glucose and lactate oxidation to CO2, and reducing lactate release in astrocytes while having little or no effect on neurons [51].",c28a9a5b-f97b-4dd3-b691-47889e4efb26
31,discussion10," dichloroacetate (DCA) effectively restored mitochondrial function and phenotypical features associated with normal astrocytes, and improved survival and motor performance of the SOD1-G93A mice [50]. This study indicates that restoring the energy metabolism of astrocytes might be a promising therapeutic approach.  Currently, there is no agreement on whether the muscle fibers, motor neurons, or the astroglial cells are affected first by the disease. To maintain the function of the neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) and the healthy contact between muscle fibers, motor neurons, and astroglial cells, mitochondrial support of all these cell types is needed. By providing an alternative energy source in the form of arginine alpha ketoglutarate (AAKG), the mitochondrial function of these cells may be preserved.",a77e40ab-3166-4be4-af49-fdda32b830ca
32,discussion11,"  Conclusions Previous studies have reported that metabolic therapies in the form of the ketogenic diet [3] or caprylic triglyceride [4] enhance motor function and may attenuate neuronal dysfunction in a variety of diseases [52]. Our results support the idea that targeted metabolic therapies, like the DP, can improve motor function and survival time, though further research is needed to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these results. Dose response studies, histological analysis, and metabolomic analysis will help to define the optimal formula to enhance metabolic substrate delivery and utilization to help mitigate the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) pathology. The components of the DP supplement have a good safety profile and are readily available over the counter, which is an important consideration in moving this therapy into phase I clinical trial.",a83862ae-a5b5-4e3f-8ed5-908046c9a0b1
