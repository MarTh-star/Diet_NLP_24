The QR code of the questionnaire was scanned at the follow-up course to conduct an online survey. The questionnaire contained questions about sociodemographic and clinical information, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Self-rating Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Family Assessment Device.   This was a cross-sectional anonymous web-based study from April 2021 to May 2021. The recruitment was performed using convenience sampling. The invitation links to online questionnaires were sent via the medical record follow-up system.

Caregivers who refused or were unable to provide consent or were illiterate or unable to read and fill in the questionnaire were excluded. Children with epilepsy coexisting with other chronic diseases (i.e., heart disease, tumors, leukemia, congenital heart disease, diabetes), which could affect the family function and mental states of caregivers, were excluded from this study.  A total of 308 caregivers were enrolled in the study, including 65 fathers and 240 mothers, and 308 children were involved.

Instrument  General Information  A self-made questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic and clinical information such as disease status of children with epilepsy, employment status of caregivers, family income, caregivers' view of the disease, ability to pay for the disease, and so on.  Self-Rating Depression Scale  It is a 20-item scale to evaluate the presence and degree of the status of depression in adults within the past week. Each of the 20 items is given a severity score from 1 (none or a little of the time) to 4 (most of or all the time), but 10 items need to be scored in reverse. The raw scores obtained on the 20 items range from 20 to 80, and the standard score is converted to a whole number that ranges from 25 to 100. As the score rises, the severity of depression increases (13).",ee7ae438-9325-4372-9cea-3fbcee81958b
3,methods3," The scale has been widely used in diagnostic evaluation, curative effect evaluation, and epidemiological investigation since it was introduced to China in 1985. In the Chinese norm, depression status is considered when the standard score was more than 53 within the past week (14).  Self-Rating Anxiety Scale  Similarly to Self-rating Depression Scale, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (Self rating Anxiety Scale (SAS)) is a 20-item scale to evaluate the presence and degree of anxiety status in adults within the past week. Each of the 20 items is given a severity score from 1 (none or a little of the time) to 4 (most or all of the time), and 5 items need to be scored in reverse. The raw score obtained on the 20 items ranges from 20 to 80, and the standard score is converted to a whole number that ranges from 25 to 100. As the score rises, the severity of anxiety increases (13).",eaad64a7-62f4-435d-9bb3-c2d44e5b0046
4,methods4," A standard score of more than 50 (Chinese norm) in Self rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) is considered as anxiety status (14).  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index  The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a self-rated questionnaire that assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Eighteen self-assessment items generate seven “component” scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. Each component score ranges from 0 to 3, and the global score ranges from 0 to 21. The higher the score, the worse the sleep quality (15). Xianchen et al. had proved the applicability of the Chinese version in 1996. This scale is widely used to evaluate sleep quality in clinical practice and research. The cutoff scores of the poor sleep quality is 7 in the Chinese norm (16).",ceb82df5-74ca-445f-8bd1-f3bc21146b8a
5,methods5,"  The Family Assessment Device  The Family Assessment Device (Family Assessment Device (FAD)) is a 60-item questionnaire based on the McMaster model, which measures family functioning. Family Assessment Device (FAD) includes seven dimensions: problem solving, communication, roles, affective responsiveness, affective involvement, behavior control, and general functioning. Higher scores indicate worse family functioning. Clinical cutoff scores were used to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy family functioning on each dimension. The cutoff scores of problem solving, communication, roles, affective responsiveness, affective involvement, behavior control, and general functioning were 2.2, 2.2, 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 1.9, and 2.0. The Chinese cutoff score of Family Assessment Device (FAD) has not yet been established.

First, the data were extracted and transferred to standard data from the detailed interview in the first part of the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were applied to analyze the sociodemographic and clinical information of children with epilepsy and caregivers, mood, sleep, and family function of caregivers.

Further, 47.1% of the children took three or more anti-seizure medications, and 43.2% were on ketogenic diet therapy. We found that in 77.9% of the cases, the subjects were the mothers, in 89% there was more than one co-caregiver, and in 51.9%, financial help was required. Further, 63.6% of the caregivers thought they could not get enough access to disease knowledge education, and 83.7% perceived epilepsy was a terrible disease. Our results also showed that 65.6% of the caregivers were in depression status, 41.9% were in anxiety status, and 49.0% had poor sleep quality.

Conclusion: Anxiety and depression status are common in caregivers of children with epilepsy, with depression status being more prominent. Moreover, a considerable proportion of caregivers had poor sleep quality and unhealthy family function. The caregivers' anxiety status, sleep quality, family role dimension, family general function dimension, and the number of co-caregivers were predictors of depression status in caregivers.

10,results2,"  children with epilepsy caregiver depression anxiety sleep family function ==== Body pmcIntroduction  Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder in children, with a prevalence of 3.2–5.5‰ in developed countries, 3.9–44‰ in developing countries (1), and 3.9–5.1‰ in China (2). Epilepsy in children is often associated with developmental abnormalities in the brain, leading to the impaired motor, perceptual, and cognitive development (3, 4). As children develop physically and psychologically, sick children often develop psychobehavioral abnormalities, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, and mood disorders that affect the child's education, future work, and marital status (5). In addition to comprehensive care for the child, caregivers of children with epilepsy also need to deal with developmental problems, educational and marital problems, and the stigma caused by the disease (6).",8af4e038-d877-4672-bfb7-bf4d7e538016
11,results3," It has been shown that most parents of children with epilepsy have negative perceptions of others' reactions (53.3%). They often experienced a sense of shame, self-blame, fear, anxiety, and depression. Parents often feared divulging their child's epilepsy to their friends and relatives. And they also limit family's social interaction, which also increased their parenting pressure (7).  Anxiety and depression are common among caregivers of children with epilepsy, and previous studies reported proportion of depressive symptoms ranging 21.6–34.9%, anxiety status in 14.5% of caregivers, and poor sleep quality in 37.6% of caregivers (8–11). A study that evaluated the impact of severe pediatric epilepsy on experienced stress and psychopathology in parents in Denmark showed that among 152 respondents, the incidence of depression was 34.9%, of which 15.8% had severe depressive symptoms and 19% had moderate depressive symptoms; 14.5% of the parents were in a state of anxiety (8).",3dd2348e-0dd6-4d10-ade1-3e4a3c8bb1a7
12,results4,"  In China, a survey conducted by Peking Union Medical College Hospital in 2009 showed that compared with the healthy control group, parents of children with epilepsy had more severe anxiety and depression, which were related to low quality of life (9). A recent study in Hunan Province, China, assessed the sleep quality, anxiety, and depression of 234 parents of children with epilepsy and 230 parents of healthy children; 23.51% of the parents of children with epilepsy had depressive symptoms. The symptoms of anxiety and depression were more severe than those of healthy children, and sleep quality was worse (10). A study in Shandong Province, China, also showed that 21.6% of the parents of children with epilepsy had moderate to severe depressive symptoms, and 37.6% had poor sleep quality (11).  As mentioned previously, epilepsy caregivers often suffered from anxiety, depression, and poor sleep quality.",ace57a33-cdb6-4575-a234-cc87748d9fa5
13,results5," Studies suggested that seizures' frequency, severity, and unpredictability compose of epilepsy burden on families (12). The main influencing factors of caregivers' stress are the child's emotional–behavioral problems and social difficulties, caregivers' control over their own situation, social support (8), and family resilience (11).  Based on an investigation of the anxiety and depression status of caregivers in children with epilepsy, this study further explored caregivers' sleep quality and family function and evaluated the predictors of depression status in caregivers. It was the first time to evaluate the caregiver's psychological status comprehensively from different dimensions. Then, we could take more accurate and targeted measures to help caregivers adjust their own state in order to improve caregivers' ability of raising children with epilepsy.",9d04592e-997e-4038-9994-cf48ea7c3e91

As in previous studies, most caregivers were mothers, with a high proportion caring for their children full-time (8). In addition, caregivers of children with epilepsy in this study felt that access to education about the disease was inadequate, which is also consistent with the results of previous studies. Studies conducted in Greece and the United Kingdom showed that caregivers were satisfied with the initial information received from doctors or hospitals about seizures and treatment. However, caregivers often had difficulty to get expertise about epilepsy and needed more access to available social resources and emotional support (17, 18). Parents of children with epilepsy, in Malaysia, also reported a need for epilepsy-related information, ongoing care, and parental support groups (19).",d7f2e600-ac04-47ad-9b51-1ac5e8c6de2d

The mean scores and the proportion of abnormal states were higher among caregivers of children with epilepsy in this study. Depression status accounted for 65.6% of the caregivers, 41.9% of caregivers having anxiety status, and 49.0% having poor sleep quality. The prevalence of depression status in caregivers was much higher than the positive rate of 3.84% for depression in the medical examination population in Shenzhen, China (20). It was also higher than the point prevalence of 3.6% of depression disorders in China's mental health survey (21). The prevalence of anxiety status in caregivers was also much higher than the point prevalence of 5.0% of anxiety disorders in China's mental health survey (21).",9866c04b-f80b-46c5-a2cf-7bf65a3d22dd

There was a higher proportion of depression status, anxiety status, and poorer sleep quality among caregivers in our study. The results might be related to the fact that the caregivers we included were caring for children with drug-resistant epilepsy and that a higher proportion of primary caregivers were mothers. Studies had shown that mothers of children with epilepsy have more anxiety and depression than fathers, mainly related to the frequency and duration of the children's seizures (22).

The presence of co-caregivers (≥1) decreased the incidence of caregiver depression status.  Our results showed that the severity of the children's disease was not a predictor of caregivers' depression status. Previous studies had shown that the frequency, severity, and unpredictability of seizures brought a burden on families (12). The degree of anxiety and depression of the child's mother was mainly related to the frequency and duration of the child's seizures (24).

A Danish study investigating the mental status and stress levels of parents of children with severe epilepsy showed that the increased caregiver stress was associated with the younger age of the child, a higher level of the child's difficulties such as emotional and behavioral problems, and social difficulties. Seizure type, seizure frequency, epilepsy category, and age at seizure onset were not significantly associated with the level of the caregiver's stress.

Another study in Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China also showed that family resilience explained 3.5 and 14.9% of sleep quality and depression. The better the family resilience, the better the quality of sleep and the less the depression among caregivers. Interventions to improve family resilience may enhance sleep quality, reduce depression, and improve family parenting of children with epilepsy (11).
