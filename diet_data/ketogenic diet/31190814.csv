0,introduction0,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is emerging as a common contributor to different degenerative disorders, including neurodegeneration (Gorman et al, 2016). However, the mechanisms of how mitochondria, the cellular centers of energy metabolism, cause an exceptional variability of non-overlapping diseases remain poorly understood. The tissue specificity is rarely explained by variable expression patterns of mitochondrial proteins, implying that tissues and/or cell types vary in their physiological sensitivity to mitochondrial insults. The disease group lacks curative treatment options.  Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS)) is an excellent example of tissue-specific mitochondrial diseases, manifesting either in the brain, liver, or muscle (Suomalainen & Isohanni, 2010). The causative genes affect nucleotide metabolism or mtDNA maintenance and cause mtDNA loss (Suomalainen & Isohanni, 2010).",553c5e7b-a3a4-4848-b345-deb7d355f651
1,introduction1," In the brain, Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS) manifests typically as severe epileptic encephalopathy, with cortical laminar necrosis and/or spongiotic encephalopathy (Alpers-Huttenlocher disease; encephalopathic Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS)) (Naviaux & Nguyen, 2004). One of the causes of brain-specific Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS) are defects of Twinkle, the replicative helicase and copy number regulator of mtDNA (Tyynismaa et al, 2004; Nikali et al, 2005; Hakonen et al, 2008; Ylikallio et al, 2010). Deficiency of functional Twinkle causes mtDNA loss and a consequential loss of mitochondrial RNAs and the core subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, III, IV and V (Milenkovic et al, 2013; Ignatenko et al, 2018). The molecular mechanisms of Twinkle-linked Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS) have remained to be discovered.",2b0f44e9-b251-420f-9c15-c1c033aff8a9
2,introduction2," Previously, we inactivated Twinkle postnatally in mice, in either neurons (TwKOneuro) or astrocytes (TwKOastro) (Ignatenko et al, 2018). The TwKOneuro mice tolerated mtDNA depletion until 7.5–9.5 mo of age without symptoms, and then developed acute, rapidly fatal neurodegeneration. Interestingly, TwKOastro mice had a very different disease course. They developed an early-onset neurological disease and progressive spongiotic encephalopathy, with massive cell-autonomous activation of astrocytes (from here on, called cell-autonomous astrogliosis). Such histological findings also characterize brain-specific Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS) in children (Alpers, 1931; Sandbank & Lerman, 1972). Classically, reactive gliosis has been attributed to astrocyte response to neuronal pathology (Brown & Squier, 1996; Lake et al, 2015).",adfb95dd-3264-452a-8e35-b14ba6b81f9b
3,introduction3," However, the findings from TwKOneuro and TwKOastro suggest that astrocytes are the primary affected cell type in spongiotic pathology in Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS). The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying astrocytic reactivity upon mitochondrial dysfunction remain unexplored; however, reactive astrocytes contribute to manifestation of other neurodegenerative pathologies (Anderson et al, 2016; Liddelow et al, 2017; Yun et al, 2018; Hartmann et al, 2019).  Disease-related stress responses to mitochondrial dysfunction are starting to be elucidated.",4e2e6282-349f-4160-87af-12a71ebac52f
4,introduction4," “Mitochondrial integrated stress response” (ISRmt), with a specific transcriptional response led by ATF3-5 transcription factors, and major remodeling of whole-cellular anabolic biosynthesis reactions, is induced by mtDNA expression defects or mitochondrial uncoupling in the skeletal muscle and/or heart (Tyynismaa et al, 2010; Ost et al, 2015; Bao et al, 2016; Nikkanen et al, 2016; Kühl et al, 2017; Restelli et al, 2018; Forsström et al, 2019; Murru et al, 2019). ISRmt includes an early-stage induction of mitochondrial folate cycle (methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2; MTHFD2), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), and a second-stage response of serine biosynthesis, transsulfuration pathway, with both autocrine and endocrine metabolic signaling roles of FGF21 (Forsström et al, 2019).",e3d1f642-211d-4bfa-89b9-2ea26392597f
5,introduction5," The altered metabolite homeostasis leads to imbalanced nucleotide pools and increased levels of serine and glycine (Nikkanen et al, 2016; Forsström et al, 2019; Murru et al, 2019). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a nutrient-sensor and a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism, is an upstream controller of ISRmt in the heart and muscle (Nikkanen et al, 2016; Khan et al, 2017). Mouse and human studies suggest specificity of the stress responses to the type of mitochondrial dysfunction or affected cell type (Lehtonen et al, 2016; Khan et al, 2017; Forsström et al, 2019; Murru et al, 2019). However, their relevance to brain diseases remains insufficiently understood.  Rapamycin treatment, inhibiting mTORC1, rescued ISRmt induction and ameliorated pathological hallmarks in the heart and muscle of mitochondrial myopathy mice (Khan et al, 2017).",b5d4be85-d672-4dd2-a2cf-3b853e2eff97
6,introduction6," Rapamycin has also been reported to improve disease signs in other mouse models with mitochondrial dysfunctions, including deficiency of respiratory chain complex I (Johnson et al, 2013, 2015; Felici et al, 2017), mitochondrial nucleotide salvage (Siegmund et al, 2017), or muscle complex IV (Civiletto et al, 2018). However, rapamycin enhanced disease progression in mice with coenzyme Q deficiency (Barriocanal-Casado et al, 2019), indicating that not all metabolic defects may benefit from rapamycin. Because of mostly encouraging results, especially in mitochondrial respiratory enzyme defects, rapamycin patient trials have been initiated in children with mitochondrial encephalopathies (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03747328).  Dietary treatments have been proposed to ameliorate mitochondrial disease symptoms.",eb0c9c04-97fd-4b05-9de2-c4b1910fe382
7,introduction7," Ketogenic diet (KD) has an anti-epileptic effect and is administered on an elective basis to patients who manifest with drug-resistant epilepsy, including those with mitochondrial disease (Wexler et al, 1997; Kang et al, 2007; Joshi et al, 2009). Cell culture studies suggested that ketone-based nutrition promotes selection against mtDNA deletions (Santra et al, 2004). In mice with mitochondrial myopathy and hepatopathy, KD promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and function (Ahola-Erkkilä et al, 2010; Purhonen et al, 2017). However, in human patients with mitochondrial myopathy and mtDNA deletions, KD induced selective damage of the most affected muscle fibers, with moderate long-term improvement of muscle function (Ahola et al, 2016). These findings indicate that diet composition has a major effect for mitochondrial muscle and liver disease progression.  Here, we report that mtDNA loss in mice activates cell-specific stress responses in mice with either neuronal or astrocytic TwKO.",b4625a57-d7b0-49bb-b0cd-891a8f5ed256
8,introduction8," Furthermore, we explored the efficacy of rapamycin treatment and KD for Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS)-related spongiotic encephalopathy. Both interventions led to premature cessation of the treatment trial because of aggravation of disease signs. Our results highlight that mitochondrial dysfunction in different tissues and cell types causes different physiological and treatment responses and emphasize the need of disease-specific treatments based on knowledge of their molecular pathophysiology.

Control mice were injected with the same volume of diluent without rapamycin.  KD Mice were administered upon weaning with Teklad Custom Diet TD.170470 containing short- and medium-chain fatty acids; with coconut oil, milk fat, and soybean oil as fat sources. 90.5% kcal is derived from fat, 9.2% from protein, and 0.3% from carbohydrates. The ratio of fat to protein + carbohydrate is ∼4.25. KD was administered on a petri dish to the bottom of the cage and changed every 3–4 d. Control mice were administered with an Altromin 1324 chow diet. Mice which failed to accept the diet and lost body weight upon initiating the diet were terminated and not included in the study.",31bb9130-998d-4b29-b6c3-b73fc9c4bcdd
12,methods3," β-hydroxybutyrate levels were measured as follows: food was removed from the cage for 4 h, and β-hydroxybutyrate was measured from a tail vein drop of blood with Freestyle Precision b-Ketone, Abbott.  Tissue collection Mice were euthanized with CO2, blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and mice were decapitated. Brain was removed from the skull and placed into an acrylic brain slicer. Sagittal cut along the midline was made, and one 3-mm hemisphere slice was collected into 4% PFA in PBS fixative for histological experiments, post-fixed, dehydrated, and paraffin-embedded. The second hemisphere was dissected, and pieces of cortex were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.  RT quantitative PCR 15–30 mg of snap-frozen mouse brain cortex was lysed in QIAzol lysis reagent (QIAzol lysis reagent (QIAGEN)) in soft tissue homogenizing tubes with ceramic beads (Precellys) using Precellys 24 homogenizer (Precellys).

The polar metabolome was extracted with 70% ethanol in water (prewarmed) at 75°C for 1 min. The clear extracts were analyzed by flow injection analysis on an Agilent 6550 QTOF instrument (Fuhrer et al, 2011) in negative mode. Putative annotations were made searching against the Human Metabolome Database (version 3.6) using accurate mass (tolerance 0.001 m/z) and isotopic patterns.

24,results0,"Metabolic response to the loss of mtDNA helicase Twinkle in the mouse brain Twinkle depletion sequentially leads to mtDNA depletion, loss of mtDNA gene expression, and respiratory chain dysfunction (summarized in Fig 1A). MtDNA depletion in neurons causes a late-onset cell death at preterminal stage of 7.5 mo (Ignatenko et al, 2018). mtDNA depletion in astrocytes leads to their cell-autonomous activation, but does not affect the number of astrocytes (Ignatenko et al, 2018). MtDNA loss is more prominent in TwKOneuro brain than in TwKOastro when compared to control mice (Fig S1B), replicating our previous findings. (Ignatenko et al, 2018). TwKOneuro, however, appear healthy, whereas TwKOastro mice progressively lose weight starting from 2 to 3 mo of age reaching humane end point (humane end point (HEP)) by the age of 5–6 mo, defined as preterminal stage (Fig S1A), as we also have reported previously (Ignatenko et al, 2018).

28,results4," (D, E, F) Multiplicity corrected P-values are shown, calculated using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Results of statistical testing can be found in Table S4 and Supplemental Data 1 and 2.  To understand the molecular underpinnings of the cell-specific responses to mitochondrial dysfunction, we investigated gene expression and metabolic changes in TwKOastro and TwKOneuro mice (Ignatenko et al, 2018). First, we asked whether ISRmt, previously characterized in the skeletal muscle in Twinkle mutant mice (Nikkanen et al, 2016; Khan et al, 2017; Forsström et al, 2019), is also induced in the brain. In 5.5-mo-old TwKOastro mice, we observed an induction of the activating transcription factors (Atf3 and Atf5), serine biosynthesis enzymes (Phgdh and Psat1), mitochondrial folate cycle (Mthfd2), and transsulfuration enzymes (CTH and CBS), as well as the metabolic hormone Gdf15 (Fig 1B–D). Fgf21 expression was not detectable.",88eabcc8-dd03-4f6d-a43e-22a204e33175
29,results5," Neuronal knockout of Twinkle, however, activated none of the tested ISRmt-related genes except for Atf3, neither at the preterminal nor young age (7.5 and 3.5 mo, respectively) (Figs 1B–D and S1C).  Next, we evaluated whether ISRmt-linked metabolic remodeling occurred in TwKOastro and TwKOneuro mice. Increased serine and glycine levels are typical for ISRmt as a consequence of de novo serine biosynthesis induction (Bao et al, 2016; Nikkanen et al, 2016). Furthermore, altered levels of other proteinogenic amino acids were also linked to mitochondrial dysfunction (Birsoy et al, 2015; Nikkanen et al, 2016; Kühl et al, 2017). Our metabolomics analyses showed a 4.5- and 3.6-fold increase of serine and glycine in TwKOastro (Figs 1E, S1D, and Supplemental Data 1), correlating with an induction of de novo serine biosynthesis enzymes Psat1 and Phgdh (Fig 1B). Interestingly, these findings were not present in TwKOneuro (Figs 1B and E, S1D and E, and Supplemental Data 2).",c1cee956-7728-465e-a201-5f5545ae84dc
30,results6," Both models displayed reduced aspartate and increased proline levels (Fig 1E). Several purine precursors or degradation products, also a part of ISRmt-related metabolic remodeling (Nikkanen et al, 2016), were increased in TwKOastro but not in TwKOneuro, and uracil, a pyrimidine metabolite, was increased in TwKOastro (Fig S1F). mTORC1 activation is an integral component of ISRmt in mtDNA maintenance defects in the muscle, showing activated phosphorylation of S6, a ribosomal protein and a target of mTORC1 (Khan et al, 2017). In TwKOastro brains, however, the total S6 amount and p-S6 were remarkably decreased (Fig 1F), suggesting that mTORC1 was not an upstream regulator of ISRmt in TwKOastro.  Supplemental Data 1.

31,results7,"   These results indicate that astrocytes activate a robust ISRmt as a response to TwKO, both on a transcriptional and metabolic level, but lacking an induction of mTORC1 or Fgf21 (Fig 1G). A similar insult in TwKOneuro did not, however, induce ISRmt. The evidence highlights cell type specificity of the response in the brain, indicating that metabolic stress in astrocytes activates ISRmt.  Rapamycin does not rescue brain pathology of TwKOastro mice To directly test the role of mTORC1 in spongiotic encephalopathy progression, we explored the effects of mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin in TwKOastro mice. We intraperitoneally injected 8 mg/kg/day of rapamycin (Rapa) or vehicle (Veh) into TwKOastro mice, starting at the asymptomatic age of 1.5 mo (Fig 2A). After only 2 wk of treatment, the rapamycin-injected TwKOastro mice started to lose weight reaching a humane end point (HEP) at 2.3 mo of age, when the experiment was terminated (Fig 2B).",140d7dc6-46a7-4542-b71b-517cf7a0ce1f

However, elevated serine and glycine levels seen in untreated TwKOastro mice were normalized by rapamycin treatment, and the drug also increased methionine levels in TwKOastro mice (Fig S2D). Furthermore, rapamycin increased glutamine levels of both wild-type and TwKOastro mice suggesting its increased production or decreased usage (Fig S2D). Several metabolites showed changes attributable to the genotype (Fig 2E, genotype panel). Rapamycin administration affected the levels of more than 20 metabolites, signifying the overall role of mTORC1 signaling in the brain (Fig 2E, treatment panel).",363203d2-19b1-4339-a5a2-e9ce08f1d320

Aspartate, produced in the mitochondria, was decreased by KD in TwKOastro, potentially reducing overall translation (Fig 3G). ATP, ADP, UDP, and FAD declined after KD in TwKOastro but not in Ctr (Fig 3F), indicating an imbalance of nucleotide metabolism and high-energy phosphate donors in diseased mice.  Altogether, our evidence indicates a remarkable effect of diet and nutrient composition to the progression of mitochondrial spongiotic encephalopathy, with deleterious consequences of both rapamycin and KD.

49,discussion0,"How different diseases and treatments affect metabolism in distinct tissues and cell types is a central question concerning mechanisms of tissue specificity and treatment effects. The topic is especially important for mitochondrial diseases that show an exceptional variability of manifestations, despite the primary origin being in one organelle. Here, we demonstrate that astrocytes and neurons respond differently to metabolic stress caused by TwKO and mtDNA loss. Astrocyte-specific TwKO leads to a robust mitochondrial integrated stress response, associated with cell-autonomous activation of the astrocytes, whereas in neurons, a similar stress causes few signs of ISRmt. Furthermore, we show that metabolic modifier interventions, rapamycin and KD, are deleterious for mice manifesting with mitochondrial spongiotic encephalopathy related to mtDNA depletion syndrome.",4ea8aea6-83bc-41ef-ad1a-f0611ed486a7
50,discussion1," Our results highlight the context-dependence of stress and treatment responses, even when different cell types encounter similar stresses.  Mitochondrial transcriptome and proteome in astrocytes and neurons differ (Eraso-Pichot et al, 2018; Fecher et al, 2019), indicating specialization of mitochondrial functions to distinct cell types of the brain. We show here that mtDNA depletion in astrocytes causes ISRmt that closely resembles the response reported in the skeletal muscle and heart with mtDNA expression insult (Nikkanen et al, 2016; Khan et al, 2017; Kühl et al, 2017; Forsström et al, 2019) or mitochondrial uncoupling (Ost et al, 2015). Astrocytic but not neuronal mtDNA depletion induced de novo serine biosynthesis and transsulfuration pathway enzyme expression.",eda3f862-9718-4cdb-8c6b-311311e34a00
51,discussion2," Previous reports found that in a healthy brain, the expression of these enzymes is enriched in astrocytes compared with other brain cell types, which possibly also explains the differential regulation of these pathways upon mtDNA loss (Zhang et al, 2014; Chai et al, 2017; Diaz-Castro et al, 2019). The signals for the induction are unknown, but could involve amino acids, metabolites, ATP, redox-status, gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide, and/or glutathione synthesis. In the Twinkle-linked mtDNA expression defect manifesting as mitochondrial myopathy, and in cultured cancer cells, a similar ISRmt response drove glucose carbon flux to glutathione synthesis (Locasale, 2013; Nikkanen et al, 2016) and to NADH production (Yang et al, 2020). Which of the pleiotropic glucose carbon fates are crucial for astrocytes with Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS) remains unknown.  Specific changes in amino acid metabolism were found in TwKOastro mice.",68049095-f34b-40e3-8ff8-b427085b2096
52,discussion3," Serine and glycine amounts were increased, consistent with induced serine biosynthesis. Proline amount was increased both in TwKOneuro and TwKOastro mice. Proline is oxidized by proline dehydrogenase, which is enriched in astrocyte mitochondria (Zhang et al, 2014), and contributes to NADP/NADPH recycling between mitochondria and the cytosol, as well as ATP production upon nutrient stress. Proline metabolism was suggested to be part of ISRmt in different mtDNA expression defects in the heart (Kühl et al, 2017), thereby indicating this pathway to be widely remodeled upon mitochondrial dysfunction in different cell types. Aspartate level was reduced in TwKOastro and was also previously reported to be a marker of mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells (Birsoy et al, 2015). Overall, our evidence highlights the central role of astrocyte mitochondria in amino acid metabolism in the brain.",e70e2263-1e0b-403c-b75b-d0a4c52027bb
53,discussion4,"  Saccharopine is an intermediate of lysine metabolism in mammalian tissues (Hallen et al, 2013), including cultured human astrocytes and neuronal progenitors (Crowther et al, 2019) and was one of the most significantly up-regulated metabolites in TwKOastro brain. Lysine degradation functions as an antioxidative pathway in yeast (Olin-Sandoval et al, 2019); however, saccharopine accumulation causes swelling of mitochondria in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice (Zhou et al, 2019). Our data point to saccharopine to be a novel, early marker of mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain, the contributions of which to pathogenesis remain to be studied.  mTORC1 is a major regulator of amino acid metabolism and has also been reported to control the key components of ISRmt (transsulfuration, mitochondrial folate cycle, nucleotide synthesis, and serine biosynthesis) in human cancer cells (Ben-Sahra et al, 2016) and in the heart and muscle in mitochondrial myopathy mice (Khan et al, 2017).",be60724c-1d62-4d67-a52f-1a1e2eb0fc28
54,discussion5," However, we found no signs of mTORC1 activation in the brain of TwKOastro, which otherwise robustly up-regulated ISRmt components. Rapamycin treatment did not affect brain pathology of TwKOastro but caused accelerated body weight loss leading to a premature cessation of the experiment. The harmful effect was not expected, as previous reports suggested beneficial effects of rapamycin on different mouse models with mitochondrial dysfunction: in NDUFS4-KO (Johnson et al, 2013, 2015; Felici et al, 2017), thymidine kinase-2 knock-in (Siegmund et al, 2017), and muscle-specific COX15-KO (complex IV assembly deficiency) (Civiletto et al, 2018) mice. Recently, rapamycin failed to rescue the brain pathology of mice with coenzyme Q deficiency, characterized by spongiotic encephalopathy and astrogliosis, similar to TwKOastro mice (García-Corzo et al, 2013; Barriocanal-Casado et al, 2019).

Whether similar metabolic changes in astrocytes underlie spongiosis and negative rapamycin effect in CoQ deficiency and TwKOastro remains to be studied. These results indicate that the effect of rapamycin depends on the underlying primary defect and may be deleterious in mitochondrial spongiotic encephalopathy. Rapamycin has profound effects on organismal metabolism in general, which may also contribute to the worsening of the phenotype, even in an encephalopathic model.  KD was also poorly tolerated by TwKOastro, and different from rapamycin, it accelerated the brain pathology progression. Astrocytes ensure nutrient uptake from the blood flow and are believed to survive rather severe mitochondrial dysfunction because of their capacity to up-regulate glycolysis (Supplie et al, 2017). KD, however, minimizes glucose availability for glycolytic ATP production.",62aeb987-9ea8-4a92-b5dd-069fd97f0a1e
56,discussion7," Despite this knowledge, KD has been used to treat epilepsy in mitochondrial diseases (Wexler et al, 1997; Kang et al, 2007; Joshi et al, 2009). Our findings present a proof-of-principle that KD worsens spongiotic encephalopathy caused by mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes.  In conclusion, the exceptional heterogeneity and tissue specificity of different mitochondrial diseases indicate that mitochondrial functions are cell type specific. Therefore, also the pathophysiological changes may drastically vary in different diseases, and require specific treatments. Promising results of interventions, such as rapamycin and KD in some mitochondrial diseases, are not automatically generalizable to the whole disease group. Our preclinical data indicate deleterious effects of rapamycin and KD in brain-related Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS), with rapid deterioration of general condition and/or brain pathology of the mice.",187e9e08-3192-4866-b85e-40db6217cfdb
57,discussion8," Therefore, our evidence does not support the use of these intervention strategies for mitochondrial spongiotic encephalopathy or epilepsy linked with mtDNA depletion. Our results indicate that metabolic modifier therapies and diets are potent modifiers of disease progression.  Limitations of the study Usage of genetically modified mouse models with cell type–specific gene knockouts provided important insights into the physiology of tissues in normal and pathological conditions. However, comparing different Cre-induced knockouts with each other is limited by the absence of strict temporal control of the effect of knockout, that is, different rates of loss of the targeted product in different cells or tissues, as well as differently tolerated thresholds of such loss.
