The study was carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines, and all experiments were also performed in accordance with Taipei Medical University guidelines.  Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 42) were purchased from the National Laboratory Animal Center and housed in the laboratory animal center of Taipei Medical University (Taipei City, Taiwan). The animals were maintained at a room temperature of 23 ± 2°C with 12 h light/dark cycles (7 a.m./7 p.m.) under 50–60% relative humidity. After 2 weeks of adaption, the mice were randomly divided into two groups.",e5105b50-7bbe-49b7-b608-7a6d17f30b5c
1,methods1," Group 1 (normal control, NC, n = 10) received a normal diet (AIN-93G) with 70% of the total calories derived from carbohydrates, 20% from protein and 10% from fat, while Group 2 (high-fat and high-cholesterol diet, high cholesterol (HFC), n = 32) were fed a high-fat diet plus 1.5% (w/w) cholesterol with 43% carbohydrates, 17% protein and 40% fat. The mice in Group 2 were randomly assigned to one of two groups, with 16 mice in each group: a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (high cholesterol (HFC)) group and a ketogenic diet (KD) group after a period of 16-week induction of obesity. The high cholesterol (HFC) group were maintained on the original diet formula mentioned above, while the KD group were fed a ketogenic diet, in which the main resource of fat was changed from soybean oil to medium chain triacylglycerol (MCT) oil, with 4% carbohydrates, 13% protein and 83% fat (Table 1).",0b3130b5-14af-4f7c-92a4-e2a1b4666d46

11,results0," Body Weight and Biochemical Parameters  The food intake amount of normal diet (NC) group, high-fat and high-cholesterol (high cholesterol (HFC)) diet group and ketogenic diet (KD) group were 4.1 ± 0.2 g/day/mouse, 3.3 ± 0.2 g/day/mouse and 3.1 ± 0.2 g/day/mouse. All mice of three groups had no water limitation. Mice fed a high cholesterol (HFC) diet showed a significant increase in body weight as compared with the NC group and the KD group (NC = 32.87 ± 2.73 g, high cholesterol (HFC) = 40.91 ± 4.21 g, KD = 31.21 ± 1.73 g). There was no significant difference in the mean kidney weight among the three groups, but the kidney to body weight ratio in the high cholesterol (HFC) group was markedly decreased. At the end of the 24-week experimental period, the biochemical parameters were measured. The high cholesterol (HFC) group had a higher serum glucose concentration and a higher HOMA-IR than the NC group (serum glucose: high cholesterol (HFC) = 555.50 ± 48.37 mg/dL, NC = 400.75 ± 32.",48fd82d9-4fab-4499-b156-9650ed74ca09

In contrast to the NC group, the total cholesterol (TC) level was significantly increased in the high cholesterol (HFC) and KD groups (NC = 52.50 ± 17.78 mg/dL, high cholesterol (HFC) = 159.44 ± 24.56 mg/dL, KD = 75.78 ± 8.18 mg/dL; p < 0.05), but the serum TC in the KD group was significantly lower than that in the high cholesterol (HFC) group. Significant differences were not observed in the serum insulin and TG levels among the three groups. To evaluate blood ketone bodies, the β-hydroxybutyrate level was measured. Following an 8-week ketogenic diet, the mice in the KD group showed a marked increase in serum β-hydroxybutyrate as compared with the high cholesterol (HFC) and control mice (KD = 5.52 ± 1.",f5b0e896-b811-42b1-b0bc-de19a3851da6

14,results3," In addition, histological examination of sections of liver tissue illustrated that the high cholesterol (HFC) diet resulted in hepatic steatosis and enlarged lipid droplets, but the ketogenic diet decreased the amount and size of lipid droplets inside the liver tissue. The mice fed a normal diet had a normal liver histological structure with no presentation of steatosis. With regards to indicators of liver damage, the levels of aminotransferase (ALT) and aminotransferase (AST) were notably higher in the mice fed the high cholesterol (HFC) diet, whereas the ketogenic diet suppressed the high cholesterol (HFC)-induced increases in serum aminotransferase (ALT) and aminotransferase (AST) levels (Figure 2).

Reproductive Organ Weights and Semen Quality  No significant differences were observed in the mean testis and epididymis weights among the three groups, but the mean vas deferens weight in the KD group was higher than the weights in the NC and high cholesterol (HFC) groups. However, the testis, epididymis and vas deferens weight to body weight ratios were remarkably decreased in the high cholesterol (HFC) mice, and were improved in the mice fed a ketogenic diet.

17,results6,"  Testicular Sections, Testicular Cholesterol, and Testosterone Levels  The testosterone level was reduced and the cholesterol level elevated in the mice fed a high cholesterol (HFC) diet. In addition, the mice fed a ketogenic diet exhibited a decreasing trend in cholesterol concentration and an increasing trend in testosterone concentration, but these trends did not reach statistical significance. However, the estradiol level was statistically significantly elevated in the high cholesterol (HFC) and KD groups as compared with the NC group (Table 2). As mentioned above, a decreased testicular testosterone concentration was observed in the high cholesterol (HFC) group, suggesting that spermatogenesis was negatively affected, which may be related to abnormal testosterone biosynthesis. Sperm maturation was evaluated by H&E staining, the slides being observed under an electron microscope. Cross-sections from the testes in the NC group indicated a normal testicular morphology.",4d4ec255-a49d-4876-9df5-6879d71b0592
18,results7," Histological examination of the testes revealed that the high cholesterol (HFC) mice were characterized by a thinner germinal epithelium, desquamation of immature germ cells, and fewer mature spermatozoa as compared with the mice fed a normal diet. Following scoring according to Johnson's scoring method, the NC group had a higher mean testicular biopsy score (mean testicular biopsy score (MTBS)) than the high cholesterol (HFC) and KD groups, whereas the ketogenic diet improved sperm maturation.

27,discussion0," In the diet-induced obesity mouse model employed in this study, the animals developed body weight gain, abnormal relative organ weights, metabolic dysfunction, and liver injury. The weight imbalance in the mice fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol (high cholesterol (HFC)) diet was later significantly reversed by an medium chain triacylglycerol (MCT)-based ketogenic diet. These results were similar to those of other studies that revealed the efficacy of the ketogenic diet, and several mechanisms have been discussed (11), which include appetite reduction (24), increased lipolysis with decreased lipogenesis (25), greater satiety, and a thermic effect due to protein consumption (26). The biochemical analysis results showed that the ketogenic diet suppressed the higher blood sugar and total cholesterol in addition to insulin resistance due to the high cholesterol (HFC) diet.

28,discussion1," (27) declared significant decreases in blood glucose, total cholesterol, LDL and TG in obese diabetic subjects following a ketogenic diet. Similarly, an animal study demonstrated that replacement of lard by medium chain triacylglycerol (MCT) in a high-fat diet ameliorated changes to fasting blood glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (28). Interestingly, no significant differences were observed in the mean concentration of serum TG in this study. Tamada et al. (29) reported that the high cholesterol (HFC) diet may inhibit the catabolism and synthesis of TG by downregulating the expressions of related enzymes. With regards to hepatic histology and function, a high fat and cholesterol intake has often been established as a model of progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) to steatohepatitis and fibrosis (30).",2be1c0d5-c9a0-423c-a4ff-40d391b78c1e
29,discussion2," The high cholesterol (HFC) group mice exhibited lipid accumulation and hepatic steatosis in liver tissue, as well as higher aminotransferase (AST) and aminotransferase (ALT) levels, which may lead to upregulation of intestinal cholesterol transporters and increased cholesterol absorption; this then induces elevated hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress and causes cell death (31). A ketogenic diet improved the hepatic sections and functions, consistent with a randomized controlled human study, which showed that education regarding a low carbohydrate diet significantly lowered liver enzyme levels as compared with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients following a low-fat diet (32).  Various studies have revealed an association between obesity and male reproductive function. An observational study demonstrated that underweight and overweight individuals have a lower semen quality, in terms of total sperm number and total motile sperm count (33).",65f8f872-4794-4022-9777-a30b81fbd531
30,discussion3," Adverse effects of a high fat (34) or high cholesterol intake (35) on the structure and function of the testes have been reported. In this study, high cholesterol (HFC) consumption induced pathological damage in testicular tissue and impaired spermatogenesis in terms of reduction of the germinal epithelium thickness, fewer mature spermatozoa, and a poor semen quality. However, the sperm motility, percentage of sperm of a normal morphology and spermatogenic cell maturation were enhanced by the ketogenic diet. Leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice developed characteristics of hyperphagia, an extreme blood sugar level, high lipid levels, severe obesity, and infertility, whereas an medium chain triacylglycerol (MCT) diet in that animal model improved spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis (36). Furthermore, ketone bodies can serve as alternative fuel for sperm and motivate sperm motility (18).",e8293f0c-dd6b-42b3-9ab8-ce6213b02ce4
31,discussion4,"  The high cholesterol (HFC)-fed mice had higher testicular cholesterol concentrations; however, the testosterone level was decreased and the estradiol level increased. Several studies have indicated that hypercholesterolemia is associated with male infertility, including testicular and sperm dysfunction (37). Moreover, a lower testosterone concentration may be due to the expression of aromatase in adipose tissue, which converts testosterone to estradiol. Another possible explanation is that the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is interfered with under high testicular cholesterol and estradiol levels (38). The ketogenic diet slightly decreased the cholesterol level and increased the testosterone level, while there were no significant differences between the high cholesterol (HFC) and KD groups.",d60c6c08-58ab-4ae8-b6a0-ef7adbc9307f
32,discussion5," We also analyzed the expressions of testosterone synthesis-related enzymes, and the results showed that the protein expression and enzyme activity of 17β-HSD were greatly reduced in both the high cholesterol (HFC) group and the KD group, suggesting that the conversion of androstenedione to testosterone was blocked (39).  Excess oxidative stress resulting in overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reductions in anti-oxidative enzymes has been demonstrated to be a possible mediator of male infertility (40). A high concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) easily causes oxidative damage owing to the abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids in sperm membranes, and leads to lipid peroxidation, sperm DNA damage and apoptosis (41).",dcc98cd7-2767-417f-9323-21cc1a1d607a
33,discussion6," Our results showed increased lipid peroxidation and a higher malondialdehyde (MDA) content, along with a decreased testicular antioxidant defense system function in the high cholesterol (HFC)-fed mice, but the medium chain triacylglycerol (MCT)-based ketogenic diet suppressed malondialdehyde (MDA) production and motivated the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes. Previous studies showed that the medium chain triacylglycerol (MCT) and ketogenic diet could reduce lipid peroxidation (42) and upregulate gene expressions of anti-oxidative enzymes through activating nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (43). Excessive apoptosis (44) and inflammation (10) may lead to inhibition of sperm production and worsen semen quality. The high cholesterol (HFC) diet could induce apoptosis and inflammation reactions, as identified in several studies (31, 45); moreover, the ketogenic diet also has significant effects on apoptosis- and inflammation-related protein expressions.",76f2c967-f1f1-4cd1-b6e6-a586b66f4e70
34,discussion7," These findings were inconsistent with other studies (46, 47) demonstrating that the anti-inflammatory effects of a ketogenic diet may contribute to the recovery of neurologic function after spinal cord injury and provide both structural and functional neuroprotective effects in a multiple sclerosis murine model, suggesting that male testicular and reproductive tissue differs from neurologic organs, being too susceptible to oxidative stress to recover from the inflammation process. Herein further study should enroll the non-obese experimental group that consumed a ketogenic diet, to compare with other groups to clarify the detailed inflammation or anti-inflammatory mechanism.  Conclusion  The results of this study demonstrated that a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet caused reduced hormone levels, decreased spermatogenesis and a poor semen quality through elevated oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation.",2bf56305-e4f8-4038-b561-d6a6420625d5
35,discussion8," Even though there was no greater enhancement in testosterone levels, testicular apoptosis and inflammation, a ketogenic diet may improve spermatogenesis and sperm parameters via enhancing the anti-oxidant capacity and reducing lipid peroxidation. The results of this study demonstrated the damage caused by a fat-enriched diet to the male reproductive function and possible related pathways.
