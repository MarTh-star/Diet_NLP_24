0,introduction0,"Osteoporosis is a common disease, especially in the aged, which is manifested as deteriorated bone microarchitectures and weakening biomechanical strengths, hence fragile bone and a higher risk of fracture . Osteoporosis is mainly caused by imbalance of bone metabolism, which might be affected by physical activities, diet intervention, hormonal and clinical status .  Basic researches of osteoporosis, including postmenopausal osteoporosis, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, and disuse osteoporosis, rely on animal models (Komori, 2015). Recently, a new concept was introduced that osteoporosis (impaired microarchitecture of the skeletons) can be caused by certain unhealthy lifestyles, diseases, or medications. It is commonly accepted that high-fat diet can be used for obesity in rodents, which weakens the activity of osteoblasts, aggravates bone loss, and decreases bone strength in rats .",f9983b91-bc41-4fcf-8ede-45dba650b9df
1,introduction1,"  As an extreme high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet, ketogenic diet (KD) was initially used for treatment of epilepsy . It was also applied to diverse neurological disorders , endocrine disorders , and cancers. However, KD has adverse effects on skeletons. Bielohuby et al. found that KD deteriorated bone growths and bone qualities in rats . Our previous studies further confirmed that KD compromises bone mass and weakens biomechanical strengths by reducing BMSCs osteogenic capability .  Ginsenoside, which is isolated from Araliaceae family, is a major pharmacologically active compound and it contains approximately 30 active components . Ginsenoside has multiple functions, such as having anticancer effects , prevention of neurological diseases , exhibition of antioxidant (Liu et al.",ef496e3e-fa39-4247-96d8-86abf949ac56
2,introduction2,", 2002) and anti-inflammatory  properties, and prevention of cardiopathy . Recently, there was mounting evidence showing that the ginsenoside has antiosteoporosis effects . Huang et al. (2014) found that ginsenoside-Rb2 displays antiosteoporosis effects in ovariectomized rats. However, whether ginsenoside has the effects of protection from bone loss induced by KD is still unknown.  Therefore, the present study is aimed at evaluating the effects of ginsenoside-Rb2 on bone loss with KD intervention. It is assumed that (1) Rb2 attenuates osteoporosis and maintains biomechanical properties in the KD mice and (2) Rb2 effectively increases the activity of osteoblasts and inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, and rebalances bone turnover.

The results showed that ginsenoside-Rb2 effectively prevents bone loss and maintains biomechanical properties in the KD group and enhances osteoblast differentiation, decreases adipogenic differentiation, and inhibits osteoclast activity.  Ginsenoside, which is a major pharmacologically active compound extracted from Panax ginseng, has a lot of biological and pharmacological benefits . The effects of ginsenoside on bone remodeling are drawing increasing attention.",6f3927e7-60a5-4702-8bd3-44468052d8df

Ginsenoside-Rb2 is the most quantitative saponin in Panax ginseng, and it increases activity of ALP, promotes calcium mineralization and osteogenic mRNA expression, and exerts antiosteoporosis effects in ovariectomized mice . Cong et al., (2017) found that ginsenoside Rb2 inhibits osteoclast differentiation. It is confirmed that ginsenoside Rb2 significantly improves osteocalcin (OCN) expression and reduces tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) expression in the bone tissue with KD intervention.  Similarly, the effect of bone remodeling is also reflected in bone turnover biomarkers in serum.",fe2fcbf0-73b1-42ec-aaf7-52a2f3ed6f83
24,discussion2," Bone tissue is continuously removed from existing bones, which is mediated by osteoclastic bone resorption, and replaced with new bone, which is mediated by osteoblastic bone formation. Resorption rate exceeding formation rate leads to osteoporosis, which is manifested as low bone mineral density (bone mineral density (BMD)) and deteriorated bone microstructures. Bone turnover biomarkers are the landmark substances of biochemical products produced during the ongoing process of bone resorption or bone formation (Bauer, 2019). Bone formation markers, including bone isoforms of alkaline phosphatase (bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP)) and osteocalcin (osteocalcin (OCN)), reflect osteoblast activity, while tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)) is considered to reflect amount of osteoclasts (Fontalis and Eastell, 2020).",1e3686a0-eb05-410c-b419-162cedd1f636

Osteoporosis is a primary result from trabecular bone destruction, and bone microarchitectures could be referred to as a proper predictor of possible bone loss and bone quality deterioration of osteoporosis . In our previous study , deterioration of bone microstructures by KD was observed after a 12-week intervention.",607b9392-375b-4607-9c0e-1050749f063d
26,discussion4," Therefore, a duration of 12 weeks was determined as the time point for this study, and the microarchitectures of cancellous bone were dramatically deteriorated after the KD intervention at the time of 12 weeks. By administering ginsenoside-Rb2, destruction of trabecular bone was alleviated to some extent. Bone volume fraction was increased by 2.6 folds in the KD + Rb2 group than that in the KD group, with amount and thickness of trabecular bone increased and separation of trabecular bone narrowed. The changes of bone trabecular microstructures were consistent with the previous study of protective effects of ginsenoside-Rb2 on ovariectomized mice, which rescued the deterioration of trabecular bone microarchitectures .  Bone mineral density accounts for bone stiffness, and collagen is cross-linking and confers strength in tension. Therefore, biomechanical properties indirectly reflect bone integrity.",0a9d37e5-ff3e-486e-8202-5264ae9c9f87
27,discussion5," However, bone strength could not be told by bone mass under some circumstances. Lin et al., (2016) revealed that aspirin showed antiosteoporosis effects with little improvement of biomechanics in high-fat-fed ovariectomized rats. In this study, we have been using micro-FE and three-point bending test to evaluate biomechanical strengths of cancellous bone and cortical bone. As our previous study presented, KD mainly affects cancellous bone, but not cortical bone . The results from the micro-FE showed that ginsenoside-Rb2 effectively maintains biomechanical strengths in cancellous bone.

In this study, ginsenoside-Rb2 shows its bone formation capacity by promoting osteoblasts differentiation and inhibiting adipocytes differentiation, which is presented by reducing adipocyte in bone marrow, elevating serum bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), promoting protein expression of osteocalcin (OCN), and inhibiting PPAR-γ expression. Meanwhile, regarding the KD mice, cathepsin K and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP), which are the biomarkers of osteoclast, were also decreased by ginsenoside-Rb2.",dc82bbce-bfe8-409e-9234-af3904d1d3d6

The results further confirm that Rb2 might improve bone mass and trabecular bone quality of the KD mice in part, and might rebalance bone turnover in mice with KD intervention (Figure 7). However, there are still limitations in this study. Firstly, we only used one dose (20 mg/kg) at a single time point (12 weeks). Various dose intervals with different time points of ginsenoside-Rb2 supplementation should be considered in future studies. Secondly, this study only showed protective effects of ginsenoside-Rb2 on cancellous bone, yet other vital markers for bone formation and bone resorption, such as bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and cathepsin K, should be detected in bone tissues, and the mechanism needs further investigation.",e5a3096b-118e-4fea-85c9-d7870dcbf57b
31,discussion9," In addition, molecular and cellular level of the effects of ginsenoside-Rb2 on formation and differentiation of osteoblast, osteoclast, and adipocyte in vitro need to be further studied.  In conclusion, this study demonstrated that ginsenoside-Rb2 effectively ameliorates bone loss and maintains biomechanical manifestations in osteoporosis induced by KD. It enhances a transition from adipogenic differentiation to osteoblastic differentiation in BMSCs with KD intervention. Therefore, it is possible to use ginsenoside-Rb2 as a substantive alternative for treatment of bone metabolic diseases, especially osteoporosis caused by KD.
