0,introduction0,"Low-carbohydrate, high-fat (Low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF)) and very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD)) are increasingly used for the management of a range of health conditions, including neurological disorders, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and various cancers (Castro et al., 2015; Henderson et al., 2006; Keene, 2006; Kulak & Polotsky, 2013; Lefevre & Aronson, 2000; Levy et al., 2012; Maalouf, Rho & Mattson, 2009; Neal et al., 2008; Paoli et al., 2013; Sumithran & Proietto, 2008; Varshneya et al., 2015). They are also used widely in the general population for weight-loss and maintenance,  with improved satiety and control of hunger frequently reported by those who adhere to these diets (Johnstone et al., 2008; McClernon et al., 2007; Paoli et al., 2015).",b9f54097-28b1-4efa-a649-a4c50a7e910d
1,introduction1," Despite the potential offered by Low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) and low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets, there is little evidence for the superiority of greater carbohydrate restriction compared to moderate. Systematic reviews show that despite greater weight- and fat-loss initially, over longer timeframes, when energy intake is restricted, there is little difference in outcomes for weight-loss, total and low density liproprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) concentrations between diets that are higher or lower in carbohydrate (Hernández Alcantara, Jiménez Cruz & Bacardí Gascón, 2015; Huntriss, Campbell & Bedwell, 2017; Naude et al., 2014; Snorgaard et al., 2017; Van Wyk, Davis & Davies, 2016). However, there are greater reductions in fasted glucose concentrations , and greater improvements in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) with greater degrees of carbohydrate restriction (Huntriss, Campbell & Bedwell, 2017).",30eaef84-dc8e-4678-9b40-4b9df1c9cc00
2,introduction2," Controversy exists about the nature of low-carbohydrate diets (low carbohydrate diet (LCD)) and very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD)s (Wood & Fernandez, 2009), and definitions for low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s range from 20 to 200 g of carbohydrate per day (Last & Wilson, 2006; Westman et al., 2007), or up to 40–45% of daily energy from carbohydrate . Definitions for very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD)s are similarly vague. The accepted definition for nutritional ketosis (NK) in the clinical nutrition field has become the achievement of ≥0.5 mmol/L ß- hydroxybutyrate, as the majority of people following a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) achieve this level of blood ketones , and this threshold has been used by several studies as an indicator of entry into NK .",0092608e-0002-4879-b1e8-e54b0ef46d51
3,introduction3," Ketonaemia consistent with NK typically results from diets containing a 3:1–4:1 ratio of lipids to non-lipid macronutrients, or at least 75% of calories coming from lipids, very low carbohydrates (often less than 50 g) and low-to-moderate amounts of protein (Livingston, Pauli & Pruce, 1977; Livingstone, 1972), or diets containing 60–75% of calories from lipids that include a high proportion of medium chain triglycerides (Huttenlocher, Wilbourn & Signore, 1971; Huttenlocher, 1976). Studies report that adherence is difficult with extreme carbohydrate restriction, that is, <50 g of carbohydrate per day (Huntriss, Campbell & Bedwell, 2017), but insulin-resistant (IR) people may be less likely to adhere to a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, compared to those who are more insulin-sensitive (IS). Adherence and weight-loss are similar between both IR and IS participants allocated to a less restrictive low carbohydrate diet (LCD) .",214fb10c-c85e-46d5-98aa-dd93762f8078
4,introduction4,"  Few studies directly compare very low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s with less extreme carbohydrate-restricted diets. Johnstone and colleagues compared the effects of a non-ketogenic low carbohydrate diet (LCD) (fat 30% of total energy (TE); carbohydrate 40% of TE) to a ketogenic, low carbohydrate diet (LCD) (fat 60% TE; carbohydrate 5%TE) in 20 adults over 6 weeks, finding that the diets were equally effective in reducing body weight and insulin resistance .  Our hypothesis was that moderate carbohydrate restriction may be easier to maintain, and thus more effective than greater degrees of carbohydrate restriction. The aim of the present study therefore, is to compare anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes between a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD), low carbohydrate diet (LCD), and moderate-low carbohydrate diet (moderate low carbohydrate diet (MCD)), containing 5%, 15%, and 25% TE from carbohydrate, respectively, in healthy adults.

The study took place between 11th September and 10th December 2017. Collection of data and analysis was performed at AUT’s Human Potential Centre, Auckland, New Zealand.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria Participants were required to be healthy and between the ages of 25 and 49 years. Exclusion criteria were; underweight (<18.5 body mass index (BMI) kg/m2), diagnosed with diabetes, diagnosed with any serious medical condition, having previously following a ketogenic diet, or being a current or former client of any of the researchers in clinical practice.

Dietary interventions and allocation Participants completed baseline testing of blood and basic anthropometric measures and a lead-in dietary recording week to identify habitual calorie intake. Participants were randomised by the study statistician to one of three low carbohydrate diet (LCD) plans which advised intakes of either 5%, 15%, or 25% of TE from carbohydrate. The randomisation was stratified by gender, using a pre-prepared sequence, with investigators blinded to treatment allocation at baseline and follow-up. Participants were assigned to the next treatment group according to their order of recruitment. The primary researcher responsible for initial statistical analysis was blinded to the treatment group allocation until this analysis had been completed.",2c46a271-7af1-46ea-a282-5d9f1125d422
7,methods2,"  Diet plans, which included macronutrient and calorie allocation and a sample menu plan, were individualised to the participant, with energy intake determined by the mean reported energy consumed per day in the lead-in dietary recording week. Advice was given to limit protein intake to 1.4 g/kg/day (weight at baseline testing), consistent with International Society of Sports Nutrition guidelines for optimal protein intake for performance . This was chosen as an appropriate protein intake that was not likely to unduly influence the study results, because the study participants were healthy people, who may also be engaged in physical activity and sports. Participants were advised to adhere as strictly as possible to the energy and macronutrient prescription for the first 3 weeks of the intervention.",60148ca5-0ace-432f-8e80-03fd54f3f614
8,methods3," For the final 9 weeks of the intervention, they were advised to eat ad libitum but to adhere as closely as possible to the carbohydrate energy limit for their treatment group as a percentage of their TE intake. Usual exercise patterns were continued. Dietary intake was recorded by participants in a mobile application (Fat Secret) with the researchers able to obtain real time entry on a partner mobile application (Fat Secret Pro). Results were monitored for safety and compliance by the primary researcher and research assistants tasked with data-monitoring. Compliance to the dietary allocation was monitored daily by a data monitoring team. Where non-compliance to the dietary allocation, especially for carbohydrate, was noticed, the participant was notified and offered support and advice.

9,methods4," Participants were instructed to contact either the clinical nutritionist or the registered dietitian in the research team for any assistance during the study duration.  Anthropometry The following measures were taken: height, weight, waist circumference at the narrowest point between the lowest rib and the iliac crest, and hip circumference at the widest point of the hips and buttocks. These measures were then used to derive body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, and the waist-height ratio at baseline and during follow-up.  Blood measures Following an overnight fast, blood samples were obtained from participants, before the first meal, via venipuncture by a certified phlebotomist from an antecubital vein and collected into plasma separation tubes (plasma separation tubes (PST)) Vacutainer tubes using lithium-heparin as the anticoagulant (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).",b29ed320-c06b-4f1e-bb4f-feaceecd68a8

Blood samples were analysed for total cholesterol (Total-c), LDL-c, HDL-c, triglycerides (TG), C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)), gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT)), alanine aminotransferase (aminotransferase (ALT)), aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase (alkaline phosphatase (ALP)), glucose and uric acid on the P800 module.

Quantitative results were determined via instrument-specific full point calibration curves and validated with specific controls. Additional information for analytes, lower limits of measurement, measuring range, and test principle can be found in Appendix 1.  Statistical analyses Effects of the dietary interventions on outcomes were determined for each participant by calculating the change in the various measures from baseline. The significance of these within-group changes from baseline was determined by a paired t-test. All between-group variations were compared using ANOVA. A 5% two-sided alpha level was used to determine significance.",238af6f2-aa8b-4de9-a780-4ee990491918
12,methods7, Further comparisons were made by undertaking multiple linear regression with adjustment made for variables recorded at baseline.

Two failed to comply with guidelines to submit baseline data and withdrew from the study (one male, one female), and three females withdrew due to changes in personal circumstances, including two who became pregnant. A further five withdrew due to challenges arising from following the diets. The reasons for withdrawals were as follows: two female participants found the dietary allocation of carbohydrate too difficult to sustain (one each in the 5% and 15% allocation groups); one did not want to continue tracking with the food app; one felt that she could not maintain her sports performance on 15% TE from carbohydrate; and one female in the 5% allocation group reported amenorrhea and reductions in strength and power, despite improved mental clarity.",11be31aa-3c6b-49bf-b95f-52bb431efc55

25,discussion0,"Principal findings Overall, the results demonstrated that reduced carbohydrate diets have a positive effect on select markers of health. Despite a high number of participants who did not present for follow-up testing, in those included for analysis, low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s were easily adhered to over a 12-week period. While there was little difference in the consistency of adherence between the differing dietary interventions for calorie and macronutrient allocations overall, carbohydrate intake was more easily maintained in the moderate low carbohydrate diet (MCD) and low carbohydrate diet (LCD) groups, as demonstrated by mean intakes lower than allocation, whereas mean intake of carbohydrate as a percentage of TE was higher than allocation in the very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group. There was a marginal increase in energy intake from baseline, but this declined over the course of the study in all groups.",4f138367-f028-4100-9d19-5ccdc67e268a
26,discussion1," Of interest was the relatively low-calorie intake recorded at baseline which might indicate a cohort focussed on weight loss or under-reporting of actual food intake.  Almost all participants began the study with anthropometric and blood measurements within the normal range. We would, therefore, not expect large changes for markers of health in a generally ‘healthy’ cohort. This was also a eucaloric intervention, designed to match habitual energy intake and was not designed as a ‘weight loss’ trial. Despite this, there were significant and clinically meaningful, albeit relatively small, improvements in weight, waist-height ratio, HDL-c, and TG. Of the changes in outcome measures that reached the threshold for significance, seven of nine were improved from baseline favourably (HDL, TG, insulin, weight, waist, hip, and body mass index (BMI)) while only Total-c and LDL-c increased by a small magnitude.",caf23f8d-0478-4934-b9e0-8aa95411b7cb
27,discussion2," Of particular interest, was the improvement in waist-height ratio, as this is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality.  We would also consider the significant improvements in HDL-c and TG to be clinically meaningful measures of interest when compared to relatively minor changes in Total-c or LDL-c. Of all the commonly measured biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, TG concentrations are most convincingly linked to incident cardiovascular disease (Harcombe et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2013; Ravnskov et al., 2016). Reductions in relative risk are seen at TG <1.02 mmol/L, with every one mmol/L increase associated with a >12% increase in risk, for both cardiovascular disease mortality and all-cause mortality . Interestingly, in the current study, while mean TG levels were reduced in all groups at 12-weeks, only the very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) group showed an improvement in TG levels, with a reduction of 0.",9720cc1a-908d-4a11-bd56-b3bac04e82c5

This suggests that the higher the baseline TG, the greater the benefit of carbohydrate restriction. Our weighted regression re-analysis also showed that baseline TG affected the change in body mass index (BMI) relative to treatment group, suggesting the hypothesis that baseline lipids may predict outcomes from diets differing in carbohydrate allocation. This hypothesis will be investigated and reported in a separate paper.  There is debate around the respective roles that Total-c, LDL-c, HDL-c, TG, and their interactions play with respect to mortality and morbidity outcomes. This warrants further investigation, especially in the context of reduced carbohydrate diets.",acaf380f-4834-441a-9eb3-7ac52e91842a
29,discussion4,"  An additional sensitivity analysis was subsequently carried out which modelled the probability of completing the study, given baseline values of age, gender, weight, TG, and glucose concentration using a logistic regression model. These values were then used in a re-analysis of the change in body mass index (BMI) at the end of the study with observations re-weighted by stabilised-inverse probability of treatment from the logistic model. This model showed a larger decrease in mean body mass index (BMI), comparing the very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) to the moderate low carbohydrate diet (MCD) group (mean change from baseline: −0.59 kg/m2; 95% CI [0.21 to −1.39]). This difference from the unweighted analysis is likely to be due to different effects of the diets by baseline TG concentration. These changes will be explored further in a future analysis.

At the conclusion of the study, all results for C reactive protein (CRP) were <5 mg/L. This suggests a positive effect on systemic inflammation from low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s overall, but high baseline results may have been due to undisclosed illness or another stressor.  Strengths and weaknesses of the study This study is one of the first to compare eucaloric diets differing in the magnitude of carbohydrate restriction for anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes in healthy people. It was a randomised trial, including food tracking with real-time researcher monitoring and feedback, along with advice and information provided to participants from a competent team with extensive experience in the prescription of low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s and very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD)s.",888a1380-9d5d-4128-b9bb-cbb29c9f99d3
31,discussion6," As such, we believe it provides a valuable addition to the literature to help inform clinical practice.  Our study was limited by small sample size and by the failure of 49% of participants to either complete the intervention or present for follow-up testing. This was expected, as high dropout rates are common in dietary studies. For example, a systematic review of low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s vs low-fat, calorie restricted diet interventions showed an overall attrition rate of 36%, with a higher rate of attrition in low-fat, high-carbohydrate interventions . Few participants reported dropping out due to challenges with the diets and most dropouts were instead due to failure to present for testing rather than failure to adhere to the diet, and these numbers were almost identical between the intervention groups. Participants who failed to present were asked to provide reasons for (not) doing so.",65c370c6-09ad-4820-9477-3fd96354303f
32,discussion7," Two participants responded, stating a clash with work and inability to attend due to parental responsibilities. It is therefore unclear whether there were other factors, outside of scheduling or other logistical challenges, that affected participants completing the study.  The final numbers included in our analysis due to attrition, therefore lacked statistical power. With larger numbers, greater statistical significance may be detected. This will be of value to elucidate the impact of differing magnitudes of carbohydrate restriction on important markers of cardiometabolic health in which there was a between group difference in change from baseline, for example, TG and HDL-c. The small sample size also highlights a potential problem of applying parametric tests, that is, whether or not the data collected fit the probability distributions associated with them. An alternative that does not rely on such assumptions is a randomisation test.",0d617f82-c60e-4ae1-bb2d-2d6c3c17dabc
33,discussion8," Results from these tests in our study were very similar to those obtained from t-tests, for example, the p-value for the between group differences in change from baseline Total-c was p = 0.658 which was very similar to the results of the ANOVA, p = 0.686.  The study also did not include a group with a higher carbohydrate allocation consistent with existing dietary guidelines of 45–75% of energy derived from carbohydrate , (i.e. a true control group) and therefore, we cannot discount that higher-carbohydrate, lower-fat diets with an emphasis on high quality food intake, a reduced preponderance of refined, energy-dense foods, nutrition counselling as available in this study, and the accountability of being involved in a study, could lead to similar beneficial results.",eebf7f0b-d9b6-4495-a55c-92726bcc066c
34,discussion9," In the recent dietfits study a higher- and lower-carbohydrate intervention, with nutritional counselling and an emphasis on ‘quality’ nutrition resulted in similar results for weight-loss over 12 months . However, in this study there was a non-significant trend towards greater weight loss, and statistically significant improvements in HDL-c and TG in the lower-carbohydrate group. In the present study, these were improved in a dose-dependent fashion per carbohydrate restriction. There is already a large body of evidence comparing low- to high-carbohydrate diets, and this study helps to instead differentiate between differing lower-carbohydrate diets and their benefits.",e05796ad-89e2-4f94-8503-53a731d8bf1a
35,discussion10,"  Meanings and implications of the study The consistency of the improvements in important predictors of mortality suggest a beneficial effect of lower carbohydrate interventions overall, and similarly, towards greater improvement on the most meaningful markers of health, concomitant to the magnitude of carbohydrate restriction. This is of particular interest because the dietary interventions were not hypocaloric and were designed to match habitual energy intake. Yet despite matching the calorie intake at baseline to the dietary prescription, meaningful anthropometric and blood measures of cardiometabolic health, were improved and trended towards greater (non-significant) improvements with greater carbohydrate restriction. However, the adherence to the carbohydrate allocation was more likely to be achieved in those on more moderate carbohydrate-restricted diets.",de6c9676-c64a-445f-880d-b65b6dfaef59
36,discussion11,"  Unanswered questions and directions for future research This study shows positive effects overall from reduced carbohydrate diets on select markers of health and further suggests a potential benefit from a greater magnitude of carbohydrate restriction, despite this greater carbohydrate restriction being more difficult to achieve. Additional research with larger sample sizes is warranted to investigate this further. Due to the large numbers that failed to present for follow-up testing, further investigation is warranted to ascertain factors associated with adherence to the diet.  Conclusion Low-carbohydrate diets are beneficial for the improvement of anthropometric and blood markers of cardiometabolic health in healthy adults and are easily adhered to over 12-weeks. However, the greatest restriction of carbohydrate to 5% of TE may not be realistically achievable for this population.",f8023257-c5fd-46bb-92d9-b05b88edb170
37,discussion12," Our results demonstrate that non-hypocaloric, low carbohydrate diet (LCD)s, matched to habitual calorie intake, result in significant improvements in predictors of long-term health including weight, waist and hip girth, waist-to-height ratio, TG, and HDL-c, which increase in magnitude with a greater degree of carbohydrate restriction. However, between-group differences typically did not reach thresholds for statistical significance, and further research with larger samples is required to investigate further, the effects of different degrees of carbohydrate restrictions on outcomes in healthy populations.
