0,introduction0," The ketogenic diet has been in use since the 1920s as a therapy for epilepsy. Since the 1960s, it has also become widely known as one of the methods for obesity treatment. Recently, this diet has been promoted as a lifestyle, making it highly controversial in terms of its practicality as a lifestyle diet and its duration without affecting one’s health or quality of life. Hence, this study assessed ketogenic diets from the people’s perspective of side effects, attitude, and quality of life.  Method: This retrospective observational study evaluated people who experienced or still practice a ketogenic diet. Health-related quality of life, the standard four-item set of healthy days core questions, was employed. We distributed the survey as an electronic self-assessment using Google Forms.",ebed55a5-1a42-486e-bb7a-311ea1f2aecc

Out of 359 enrolled individuals, 226 experienced a ketogenic diet, and 133 were excluded.  Data collection tool  We developed an Arabic questionnaire to collect necessary information about ketogenic diet attitudes and quality of life (questionnaire in the Appendices section). Our questionnaire adopted health-related quality of life (health related quality of life (HRQOL)) measures, the standard four-item set of healthy days core questions developed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC health related quality of life (HRQOL)-4).",6f545a8e-104f-44d3-9259-7f46866d0910

9,results2," ==== Body pmcIntroduction  Overweight and obesity are health-impairing conditions characterized by abnormal or excessive fat accumulation. They are considered an epidemic that is largely caused by an environment that promotes excessive food intake and discourages physical activity in all ages. In 2008, over 200 million men and nearly 300 million women aged 20 years and over were obese, and 65% of the world’s population lives in countries where being overweight and obese is more detrimental to people than being underweight. Obesity is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and along with dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes, it contributes to metabolic syndrome [1]. Obesity is a difficult issue to deal with, but weight loss can be achieved by several solutions focusing mainly on decreasing energy intake and increasing energy consumption; such solutions include exercise and behavioral, pharmacologic, surgical, and device interventions [2].",8beb631b-1964-496e-8d29-0ccd2282ce9a
10,results3,"  The ketogenic diet, which is a high-fat, adequate-protein, and low-carbohydrate diet, gained a resurgence of interest during the past decade for the treatment of difficult-to-control seizures in children [3]. Also called a very low-carbohydrate diet, the ketogenic diet has been in use since the 1920s for epilepsy therapy; in some cases, it can completely eliminate the need for medication. From the 1960s onwards, it has become widely known as one of the most common methods for obesity treatment [4].  However, the ketogenic diet is not considered a benign, holistic, or all-natural treatment. As with any serious medical therapy, it may result in complications, although generally less severe and less frequent than those of medication or surgery [5]. Furthermore, most of the studies regarding this diet evaluated pediatric populations with common side effects, including constipation, low-grade acidosis, and hypoglycemia [6]. Cholesterol levels may also increase by approximately 30% [5].",bbf13083-a3dc-4335-ad22-9ef686df100c
11,results4,"  Recently, the ketogenic diet has been promoted as a lifestyle, but it is highly debated in terms of how practical to adopt it as a lifestyle and how long people can continue on such a diet without affecting their health or quality of life. In this study, we aimed to assess behavioral aspects/experiences of ketogenic diet from people’s perspective of side effects, attitude, and quality of life.   According to the study design, 226 participants who adopted a ketogenic diet were interviewed to explore their ketogenic diet experience and to determine its consequences on their physical and mental health. Characteristics of the study group females were slightly more than males (52.7% vs. 47.3%), and more than one-half of the participants (55.3%) aged 18-35 years. In addition, 55.3% had obesity and 26.1% had morbid obesity (Table 1).  Table 1 Characteristics of the respondents (n = 226)  BMI: body mass index  Characteristics	Number	Percentage (%)	 Gender	Male	107	47.3	 Female	119	52.",95ac95b8-c1cb-4303-ac7c-0a726811143d

Among them, 12.8% followed it for six to 12 months, and 7.5% for more than one year. Two-thirds (65.5%) of the participants claimed that it was their first time to experience a ketogenic diet, and the second time for 14.6%. Furthermore, 17.3% reported that they experienced it more than thrice.  During the ketogenic diet, more than one-half of the respondents (58.4%) maintained physical exercise. Meanwhile, 54.4% had cheat meals and 42.5% of them had no specific routine. Almost one-half of the participants (48.7%) depended on social media as a source for preparing their ketogenic diet, whereas only 2.2% consulted dietitian (Table 2).",3779477d-8c5e-4426-891a-c5bd693e9aea

14,discussion0," According to the data analysis, the distribution was almost equal for males and females. Furthermore, more than half of the participants were 18-35 years old, possibly related to many contributing factors affecting this age group. For instance, people at a young age have a higher tendency to gain more weight, eat unhealthy food, and follow unhealthy habits [3]. Furthermore, many young-aged individuals are trying to lose weight because this age group is concerned about body weight, which could affect employment, marriage, or body image. This viewpoint could explain why this young-aged group is trying to follow new methods and trends of weight-loss diets, including ketogenic diets [8,9].  Moreover, most of the respondents were either overweight, obese, or morbidly obese, and only 12.4% had a normal body mass index. Thus, most of these participants adopted a ketogenic diet to lose weight.",5436e4cb-5a89-4e53-94b0-8b93f30aedf6
15,discussion1," A ketogenic diet could be healthy a lifestyle diet, but it is difficult to adopt, as evidenced by the duration of diet commitment. Most of the participants (69.9%) used this diet for more than one month, with 12.8% for six to 12 months and only 7.5% for more than a year. In addition, two-thirds of the participants used this diet once, 14.6% twice, and 17.3% thrice. Therefore, a ketogenic diet is hard to adopt as a lifestyle and maybe only a temporary effective method for weight reduction. Further research is needed to assess its difficulty in the long-term application; perhaps, it may be explained by its side effects or its strict nature.  Overweight individuals can lose more weight through caloric restriction than through exercise, although more of the weight loss by dieting is from lean body mass. However, diet intervention with exercise can lose more weight than diet intervention alone [10].",39bffa08-a3c2-4217-812c-38991fafd8b5
16,discussion2," Accordingly, more than half of our participants performed physical exercise while on a ketogenic diet, whereas 41.6% did not perform any physical exercise. This finding may explain the outcomes of a ketogenic diet, prompting healthcare providers to conduct further education and awareness to the public about the importance of physical activities [11]. Additionally, slightly more than half of the participants (54.4%) had cheat meals, possibly affecting the ketogenic diet outcomes; once they have cheat meals, they are out of the diet. In other words, the exact ketogenic idea is disrupted; thus, the desired results may not rely on whether the participants did not follow the diet again or whether they kept having a weekly cheat day. Moreover, most of the participants based their food preparation on what they learned on social media or simply self-prepared their meals. Only roughly 2% consulted a dietitian or availed of ready-made meals.",ae030ab5-506f-49a8-af40-6d8f91afe4ed
17,discussion3," Individuals aiming for a ketogenic diet should seek the assistance of a dietitian from a scientific perspective to increase awareness and help anyone who wants to try a ketogenic diet in a proper way [12].  Most of the participants (96.9%) lost weight, and approximately 30% showed significant weight loss (≥10 kg). Only five participants did not notice any change, and two gained weight, possibly because of the quality of the diet practice or maybe they are still in the early stage of their diet. The high percentage of weight loss could confirm the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in weight reduction [13].  Weight loss is the probable reason to adopt a diet, and people are more prone to follow any diet with a reputation that goes around weight loss without focusing on the possible side effects or the possible negative health impact. The respondents reported different symptoms and side effects.",d2e46a55-fd56-408b-9dd0-d98e7a5abdee
18,discussion4," Frequent side effects were dizziness, nausea, polyurea, halitosis, palpitations, sluggishness, constipation, and muscle pain-all of which have different intensities-either mild, moderate, or severe.  In the first month of adopting a ketogenic diet, the overall self-reported perception of the respondents about their physical and mental health was very positive, excluding the first few days wherein the respondents felt poor physical and mental health that prevented them from doing usual daily tasks for an average of one day. Poor physical and mental health in the first few days of a ketogenic diet can be explained by the body’s effect of switching the use of glucose as the main source of energy to ketone bodies. Generally, most of the respondents (90.3%) felt happy about adopting a ketogenic diet, and 81.9% would recommend this diet for anyone who wants to lose weight.  The study has some limitations.",8df54e5f-b121-4260-b205-362965c1025a
19,discussion5," First, it was distributed over the social media group with a special interest in a ketogenic diet, thereby possibly exaggerating the positive attitude toward this diet. Second, the symptoms were derived from previous studies that included the pediatric population, which could have outcomes different from those of the adult population. Finally, this study asked retrospective questions, which could be affected by the whole participant experience and recalling of the symptoms.  Conclusions  Most of the participants adopted a ketogenic diet for one to six months, indicating that this diet is only a short-term solution to weight reduction. Almost all of the participants lost weight, indicating the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in weight reduction. Different symptoms and side effects were also reported, with varying intensities, especially in the first few days of adopting this diet.",7ba93041-15d8-4ba4-8b62-8d47ba021985
