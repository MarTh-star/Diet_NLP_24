0,background0," The ketogenic diet (KD) is increasingly used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy because of its favorable effect on seizure reduction. Patients with mitochondrial diseases tend to experience seizures. Therefore, this study aimed to test the efficacy of the KD on participants with mitochondrial diseases in a controlled trial.

1,methods0," Study Population  This prospective study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Chinese Clinical trial registry, with a Clinical trial registration No. of ChiCTR1900020789. Nutritionists from multiple centers received uniform training and a uniform case report form was used. Informed consent was signed by each participant before entering this program. Mitochondrial diseases were confirmed using gene diagnosis (pathogenic gene mutations found in mtDNA or nDNA) and abnormal biomarkers (lactose and pyruvate). If the genetic diagnosis showed variants of uncertain significance, clinical features that could match the mitochondrial disease were also employed. Epilepsy conditions were assessed using the International League Against Epilepsy classification (22).",3d52bdfa-e1c8-484a-9eb8-1693176e763a
2,methods1," Patients who met the following conditions were excluded: those who received KD therapy in the past, or had other inherited metabolic diseases, immunodeficiency, or severe disorders of the digestive, cardiovascular, respiratory, liver, or urinary systems. We planned to recruit 96 patients aged ≤ 16 years who had mitochondrial diseases with epilepsy from 14 clinical centers (listed in Appendix I) between January 2019 and December 2020. However, a total of only 33 participants were enrolled in the study.  Procedure  Before KD initiation, physicians presented the participants and their families with plans for the study project, ethics profiles, and basic information of KD, and asked if they were willing to be included in the study. Participants and their families signed informed consent forms and underwent enrollment tests and assessments.",0bf71b1d-9fc0-4a09-a0ed-ad47188d0f82
3,methods2," Dietitians explained the details about the KD to the families, assessed the nutritional status of participants, and registered the participants' profiles. All qualified participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a control (regular diet with additional new ASMs) and study (KD with ASMs) group.  The intervention period for the study group (KD group) was 12 weeks, including the baseline period (1 week), titration period (3 weeks), and observation period (8 weeks). There was no change in ASMs' usage during these periods. KD was started with a 2:1 ratio (fat mass to non-fat mass), no liquid limitation, and no fasting. The ketogenic formula was provided by Shenzhen Zeneca Biotechnology Co., Ltd. The participants started KD as either inpatients or outpatients, based on their condition. The dietitian calculated the daily energy requirements of participants according to their age, height, and weight.",7fa2d9e6-b6c0-4699-b916-673d5cd54fe7
4,methods3," On the first day, one-third of the total energy was consumed, and food was separated into three or four meals, based on their eating habits. From days 2–4, the energy intake was two-thirds of the total requirement. Blood ketones and glucose were monitored every 6 h during the first 4 days. All side effects (such as hyperketonemia and hypoglycemia) were taken seriously and promptly managed. From day 5, the energy intake was the full daily requirement. During the baseline period, dietitians recorded the participants' condition using an observation table. The first month of KD was named the efficacy observation period, also called the titration period and was the key period of adjustment. Physicians or dietitians adjusted the KD ratio, daily energy intake, mealtime, number of meals, and calories in each meal, according to the condition of the participants. At week 12, when the project was completed, the participants could decide whether to stop or continue KD.",5b025c5e-c4a8-42ac-b2a4-83aaaf83aa00
5,methods4," If they continued, there was a 36-month diet follow-up period during which physicians, dietitians, and families discussed the ASM adjustment plan and ensured that participants adhered to the KD for better efficacy.  The control group was initiated with a normal diet and adding new ASMs in the first 4 weeks, after which, they followed the KD course for 12 weeks. The KD course in the control group was the same as that in the study group. Essentially, the control group had a study period of 16 weeks: the normal diet period (4 weeks), baseline period (1 week), titration period (3 weeks), and observation period (8 weeks).  Parents could decide to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason such as poor efficacy or tolerance. Physicians could also terminate KD if the participants experienced side effects or exacerbation of diseases.",452ec974-34b5-420f-a652-32e3be14f8f9
6,methods5,"  Assessment  The study group underwent daily face-to-face (inpatient) or phone call (outpatient) interviews during the baseline period, weekly phone call interviews during the titration period, and phone call interviews every second week during the observation period. Clinical assessments were performed at the hospital at baseline and after four and 12 weeks of the KD in the study group. The control group underwent clinical assessments at baseline, at week four of regular diet, and after 4 and 12 weeks post KD initiation (weeks 8 and 16 of the study period). Baseline assessments included laboratory tests, nutrition assessments, family interviews, and other tests, if needed, such as growth scales, magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), electroencephalogram (EEG), and biopsy.  The primary outcomes during the study period were efficacy and biomarker levels.",afc57733-5d73-41e1-a611-5882b3397109

The decrease in the percentages were calculated from seizure records between the baseline and the study period. Only ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency lasting >4 weeks was considered effective. Biomarkers included lactose, pyruvate variation, and blood pH levels, which were measured at the clinical visit assessment. Other outcomes included improvements in EEG, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and quality of life. Cognition, behavior, and growth conditions were evaluated using the Gesell Scale or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Safety indices included the incidence rate of hypoglycemia, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, high cholesterol, lithiasis, and other side effects; biochemical monitoring of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism; and disease-related tests such as blood gas analysis and type B ultrasound.",2b6ddd90-9f4d-46db-a1a6-ab0f6f8d2b12

Nutrition indices were assessed at baseline and during the study period, and included weight, height, body mass index, body content, serum protein, and hemoglobin.  Data Analysis  Data analyses were conducted using the SPSS software (version 26.0). Sex, course length, drug usage, and seizure frequency between the KD and control groups at baseline were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Age differences between the groups was analyzed using an independent t-test. The Fisher's exact test was used to assess differences in response rates among the KD group (1 month KD) and the control group (1 month drug therapy), and the KD and control groups after 1 and 3 months of diet intervention.

13,results3," Most participants were diagnosed with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes (mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS)), and uncategorized mitochondrial diseases with epilepsy (Table 1).  Efficacy of KD  Five different KD ratios were used in this trial, ranging from 1:1 to 4:1 (Figure 2). A ratio of 2:1 was most common (20/33), only three participants were initiated with a KD ratio higher than 2:1. Overall, 78.8% (26/33) of participants reached ketosis (defined as >2 mmol/L of blood ketones) within 5 days of starting the KD in Figure 2.

In the control group, only 18.2% (2/11) of participants had ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency with 1 month of general diet plus new medications. However, the seizure condition improved once the participants transferred to KD. One month after the transition to KD, 63.6% (7/11) of the participants in the control group had ≥50% seizure reduction, and this rate increased to 72.7% (8/11) after 3 months (p > 0.05). Further 27.3% (3/11) of the participants in the control group were seizure-free. Based on the data analysis, there was no significant difference when comparing the additional drugs treatment with KD intervention at 1 month (p > 0.05), however, there was a significant difference between the KD intervention at 3 months and the drugs treatment at 1 month (p < 0.05) in the control group. Therefore, these seizure improvements were independent of drug adjustment with a general diet. Additional details are presented in Table 2.",583fece4-4a1b-456d-a30f-5ab04d422905

Participants with mtDNA mutations responded remarkably to KD (93.3%, 14/15), nine of whom had the pathogenic variant m.3243 A>G. Participants with nDNA mutation responded less favorably to KD, with an effective rate of only 37.5% (3/8).

19,discussion0," Our results showed the benefits of KD in mitochondrial disease treatment. Few studies have discussed the efficacy of KD in the treatment of mitochondrial diseases. A recent systematic review reported that 7/8 patients with mitochondrial diseases responded to KD treatment (5 seizure-free, 1 reduction of seizures, and 1 control of status epilepticus) (23). Two other studies with mitochondrial respiratory chain defects in epilepsy patients found that 71–75% of participants experienced >50% seizure reduction after KD intervention (17, 18). The response rates of mitochondrial diseases in this study were similar to those in refractory epilepsy studies, in which response rates for the KD and control groups were 35–56.1% and 6–18.2%, respectively (24–31). In addition, the International League against Epilepsy (International League against Epilepsy (ILAE)) also attests to considerable response rates (70%) of KD to epilepsy and recommended this therapy in its guidelines (32).",91c0fbb3-3673-4263-98f8-adb7621e9e87
20,discussion1," On comparing our results to previous studies and International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) guidelines, with the 76% (19/25) response rate of trial-completed participants, it is reasonable to state that KD could effectively improve seizure conditions of mitochondrial diseases with epilepsy.  Surprisingly, the response rate of the KD group seemed to be lower (although this was not statistically significant) than that of the control group who had changed to KD after 1 month of the control period. However, the explanations for this could vary. First, eight participants in the KD group withdrew, while only two withdrew from the control group after changing to KD. A high withdrawal rate certainly influenced response rates. Second, although most participants in both groups started with a 2:1 ratio diet, more participants changed to a lower ratio in the KD group after dietary adjustment. Some studies have noted that the classic KD with a higher ratio may lead to better seizure control (33).",3a3d369b-c6a5-45d6-8d33-1e153d0528da
21,discussion2," However, other studies have indicated that there is no difference in efficacy between high and low ratios (34). The relationship between the ketogenic ratio and treatment efficacy remains controversial. Another plausible reason for the difference that we reported is participant bias. Even though statistical analysis found no difference in seizure frequency between groups at baseline, it seemed that participants in the KD group had relatively more seizures.  Other than reduction in seizure frequency, some participants experienced favorable biomarker changes and cognitive improvements at 3 months. Similar biomarker changes have also been demonstrated in studies of mitochondrial disease (35, 36). The Neuropsychological Development Scale (0–6 years old) and Wechsler Scale showed that three participants had a development quotient and mental age increase, or total score improvement.",7cd23489-af9c-4a4f-967e-3105aad895d2
22,discussion3," The results of cognition improvement in our study were not as good as those from epilepsy treatment (37, 38), probably because only a few participants underwent cognitive assessment.  mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS) is a maternally inherited multisystemic disorder caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA and is the second largest subgroup of diseases in this study. The relationship between certain gene mutations and mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS) has been extensively discussed. One study showed a high consistency between mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS) and m.3243 A>G variants (39).

23,discussion4,"3243 A>G variant in the mitochondrial tRNA gene was present in 21/23 mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS) participants, 11/11 oligosymptomatic relatives, and 12/14 asymptomatic relatives, but not in 5/50 mitochondrial disease (39). Another study indicated that gene variants were found in 26/31 participants with mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS), but only in 1/29 participants with CPEO (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia), 0/5 participants with MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers), and 0/50 control participants (40). In general, more than 80% of participants with mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS) have the m.3243 A>G variant, with m.3271T>C, the second most common mutation, found in 10% of participants (41, 42).",b554906d-6979-447e-bec5-623816abf172
24,discussion5," In our study, all participants with mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS) were diagnosed with the m.3243 A>G mutation. In addition to the m.3243 A>G variant, some other gene mutations presented in this study were also found to be related to mitochondrial diseases in previous studies, such as m.3697G>A and m.8344A>G (43–45). To the best of our knowledge, mutation of m.127720 A>G and m.15596 G>A, have not previously been discussed and our study is the first to relate them to a particular disease.  In our study, KD was found to be highly effective (89%) in participants with mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS). However, the relationship between mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS) and KD has not been studied extensively.",abe8f893-8d46-47cb-b05e-9121c5765a12
25,discussion6," In a cellular model, exposure of neuronal cells to ketone bodies increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, improved mitochondrial metabolism, and restored the activity and stability of complex I, which is impaired in mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS) (46). In a case study, a 22-year-old female patient's seizures were unaffected by the addition of new anti-epileptic medications; however, after receiving a modified KD, she experienced an improvement in seizure control and a decrease in stroke-like episodes (47). From a genetic perspective, KD strongly effects mitochondrial DNA mutations, especially the m.3243 A>G variant, which was the largest gene mutation subgroup. An earlier study indicated that a severe m.3243 A > G mutation might impair fuel catabolism and cause mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS) (48).",debfff78-822b-4469-8564-8799b586da20
26,discussion7," Some studies have proposed that KD may induce electron transport chain subunit mRNA to increase mitochondrial biogenesis. This results in increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, leading to increased neuronal “energy reserves,” allowing neurons to withstand metabolic challenges and stabilize neuronal membrane potentials (49, 50). KD appeared to be effective for other mtDNA mutations in this study, including m.3697 G>A, m.8344 A>G, m.3243 A>G+m.3271 T>A, m.127720 A>G. The response rate of nDNA mutations was much lower, as only four participants with COQ4, POLG, and PDHB variants were participants. In nDNA-related research, low glycemic index treatment (low glycemic index treatment (LGIT)) was found to be effective in treating mitochondrial epilepsy with POLG1 gene mutation. In the report, the visual aura and aphasia could not be resolved in an adult participant with three ASMs.",4d91a366-d47b-474e-a008-f377d4c2941f
27,discussion8," After the introduction of the low glycemic index treatment (LGIT), the headaches, aphasia, and visual aura progressively improved and disappeared. The participant improved and returned home two weeks later, and the seizures disappeared (20).  Ten participants withdrew and 7/10 reported poor compliance. Most of these had trouble with food operations and feeding. The high-fat and low-carbohydrate food composition was quite different from the regular diet, especially in China, where carbohydrate rich foods such as rice are still the predominant component in a meal. Thus, education and training for participants or caregivers prior to dietary intervention is important. Some researchers believe that new therapies are urgently needed to broaden the management options and improve the prognosis of patients (51), thus, tools of e-health management and recipe software could have increased the treatment compliance (52, 53).",e1880239-ad4a-4764-85ce-6bbf7eb925fb
28,discussion9," Additionally, correct management of the KD in patients with refractory epilepsy is important from the beginning to avoid side effects (54). One participant died during the study period. Epilepsy was noticed in this participant 2.5 months after birth, and he was diagnosed with COQ10D7. His eating ability was poor; therefore, constant tube feeding was used. At 11-months of age, he was admitted to the KD group and passed away 1 month later. He had normal stools and marked seizure improvement, but experienced vomiting. No other medical condition was present. The cause of death was unknown and may have been related to sleep apnea. According to previous reports, respiratory distress, cerebellar atrophy, and lactic acidosis are common symptoms of COQ10D7.  In total, seven participants experienced side effects during the intervention, with five reporting gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, including vomiting, bloating and GI disturbance.",e20e8ea3-dd33-477a-9114-86b709ea994e
29,discussion10," This is similar to other studies (26, 55–57) showing that approximately 30%−40% of participants had GI side effects, but our study showed a lower incidence. This difference could account for the relatively low ketogenic ratio observed in our study. One participant reported hyperlipidemia, which is not unusual in KD, but some studies have found that long-term KD intervention often keeps the serum lipid profile within normal limits (58, 59).It is important to manage side effects properly to encourage patients to remain on the KD.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective controlled study to discuss the efficacy of KD in the treatment of mitochondrial diseases with epilepsy. The larger sample size in this study made the therapeutic effects of KD on mitochondrial diseases more credible.",ea568397-2d82-418a-bd7a-fd49194d6622
30,discussion11," Detailed genetic information for each patient also confirmed that KD was more efficient in mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS) and mtDNA mutations, especially for the m.3243 A>G pathogenic variant. However, our study has some limitations. The first limitation was the brief period of the normal diet in the control group, however a full 3-month period without dietary treatment may not be acceptable to parents. The second limitation is the unbalanced number of participants in the KD and control groups. Third, the use of parental seizure records might have introduced subjective errors such as overestimation or underestimation of seizure numbers. The combined utilization of subject records and EEGs may improve the scientific weight. Long-term blind trials are suggested for further studies.  Conclusion  Our study showed that KD is effective and can be included in the management of patients with mitochondrial disease and epilepsy.",6c15da15-cc3f-43da-b4e7-151ed75df992
