0,background0,"The liver plays a critical role in the metabolic response to changes in the diet. An important regulatory mechanism in the control of metabolism is via changes in the expression of relevant genes. Indeed, changes in nutrient composition and nutrient availability trigger profound changes in the hepatic expression of numerous genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. An important transcription factor that is involved in the adaptive response to changes in nutrient supply is PPARα [1, 2]. PPARα is a member of the family of nuclear receptors and part of the subfamily of Peroxisome Proliferators Activated Receptors, which also includes PPARβ/δ and PPARγ [3]. The PPARs share a common mode of action that involves heterodimerization with the nuclear receptor RXR (Retinoid X Receptor), followed by binding of the PPAR-RXR complex to specific DNA sequences in the regulatory regions of target genes [4–6].",b1cfebc2-4b17-4e1e-bd29-aa2ef1fc8eb6
1,background1," Activation of transcription is triggered by binding of a ligand, which include fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives such as eicosanoids and oxidized fatty acids, as well as a variety of synthetic compounds collectively referred to as peroxisome proliferators [7].  Evidence abounds indicating that PPARα is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism during fasting. Indeed, studies employing expression profiling of whole body or liver-specific PPARα−/− mice have demonstrated that PPARα induces the expression of hundreds of genes involved in nearly every branch of hepatic lipid metabolism [8–12]. Hence, PPARα can be aptly described as the master regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism, especially under conditions of elevated hepatic lipid load, as occurs during fasting, high fat feeding, and a ketogenic diet.",10a51cd5-7ffd-40ff-90bb-8d016630e0fc
2,background2," In line with this notion, the absence of PPARα during fasting leads to a host of metabolic disturbances, including a fatty liver, elevated plasma non-esterified fatty acids, hypoglycemia and hypoketonemia [8–12].  Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3 Like 3 (CREB3L3, encoded by Creb3l3) is a bZiP transcription factor that is highly expressed in the liver [13]. CREB3L3 is produced as an ER precursor form and is proteolytically activated in the Golgi to liberate the N-terminal portion that functions as a transcriptional activator [13]. Growing evidence implicates CREB3L3 in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver [14]. Specifically, CREB3L3 has been shown to stimulate gluconeogenesis [15] and glycogenolysis [16], plasma triglyceride clearance [17], and lipid droplet formation [18].  Both PPARα and CREB3L3 are activated in the liver by fasting and play important roles in the utilization of fatty acids for energy in the fasted state [8–10, 19].",f97c43d5-08c6-4c1b-be29-fdd985a5291c
3,background3," Several lines of evidence point to an interaction between PPARα- and CREB3L3-mediated gene regulation. First, PPARα has been shown to regulate CREB3L3 expression in human and mouse hepatocytes [20], likely via a PPRE located upstream of exon 3 [21], indicating that Creb3l3 is a direct PPARα target gene. Second, there is strong evidence that PPARα and CREB3L3 cooperate in the regulation of certain genes such as Fgf21, encoding Fibroblast Growth Factor 21. Specifically, PPARα and CREB3L3 physically interact to form a complex that binds to an integrated CRE-PPAR-responsive element-binding motif in the Fgf21 gene promoter [22]. The physical interaction between PPARα and CREB3L3 is enhanced by fasting and dependent on CREB3L3 acetylation at K294 [23]. More recently, it was shown that during fasting, PPARα and CREB3L3 also cooperate in the stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis by targeting genes such as Pck1, encoding Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase 1 [16].",4a242aed-c0a9-43f5-9d0d-1a7d837d675b
4,background4," Other genes that are under dual control of PPARα and CREB3L3 in liver include Cidec, encoding Cell Death Inducing DFFA Like Effector C [18, 24]. The data presented above suggest that part of the effects of PPARα may be mediated by CREB3L3 and point towards cooperativity in gene regulation by PPARα and CREB3L3. Based on the analysis of the phenotype of single and combined PPARα−/− and CREB3L3−/− mice, it was proposed that CREB3L3 co-operates with PPARα by directly and indirectly regulating the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis [25].  To further characterize the cooperativity between PPARα and CREB3L3 in hepatic gene regulation, we studied the effect of PPARα and CREB3L3 ablation, either individually or combined, on overall hepatic gene regulation using whole genome expression profiling, in mice after a 16-h fast and after 4 days of ketogenic diet.

The two lines were interbred to generate combined PPARα/CREB3L3−/− mice. Mice were housed in a specific pathogen free facility at the Weill Cornell Medical College on a 12 h light/dark cycles and fed ad libitum standard chow diet (PicoLab Rodent diet 20, #5058, Lab diet). The four different mouse lines (wild-type, PPARα−/−, CREB3L3−/−, and PPARα/CREB3L3−/−) were either fasted for 16 h or fed a ketogenic diet for 4 days (# F3666, Bio-Serv). The mice used for experiments were all male and approximately 8 weeks old. The euthanasia was carried out at around 10 a.m., with the ketogenic diet group being non-fasted (ad libitum fed).",dd838f1a-344b-4342-bfb6-a436b4c9f1d9

13,results0,"Effect of PPARα and/or CREB3L3 ablation on fasting plasma metabolites To study the potential interaction between PPARα and CREB3L3 in metabolic regulation in the fasted state, we first performed basic metabolic measurements in wild-type, PPARα−/−, CREB3L3−/−, and combined PPARα/CREB3L3−/− mice after 16 h of fasting. Plasma triglyceride levels were markedly elevated in the CREB3L3−/−, but not in the PPARα−/− mice (Fig. 1a). The hypertriglyceridemia in CREB3L3−/− mice was improved by the simultaneous ablation of PPARα, suggesting functional antagonism between PPARα and CREB3L3 in plasma triglyceride regulation (Fig. 1a). As previously shown [9], PPARα ablation significantly increased plasma non-esterified fatty acid (non esterified fatty acid (NEFA)) levels (Fig. 1b), and decreased β-hydroxybutyrate levels (Fig. 1c).",3ae009b5-7265-4903-b997-249c580264cd
14,results1," In agreement with our previous report [19], non esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and β-hydroxybutyrate levels were elevated in CREB3L3−/− mice, while levels in PPARα/CREB3L3−/− mice were similar to those in PPARα−/− mice (Fig. 1b and c), suggesting a dominant effect of PPARα ablation. Interestingly, liver triglyceride levels were elevated in both PPARα−/− and CREB3L3−/− mice compared with wild-type mice and were highest in the combined PPARα/CREB3L3−/− mice (Fig. 1d). Plasma FGF21 levels were dramatically lower in PPARα−/−, CREB3L3−/−, and PPARα/CREB3L3−/− mice as compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 1e). These data indicate the pronounced impact of PPARα and CREB3L3 deficiency on metabolic regulation during fasting.Fig. 1 Effect of single and combined PPARα and CREB3L3 deficiency on metabolic parameters.

16,results3,"001)    Effects of PPARα and CREB3L3 ablation on hepatic gene expression in the fasted state are largely independent To study the potential interaction between PPARα and CREB3L3 in hepatic gene regulation in the fasted state, whole genome expression analysis was performed on liver samples of the four groups of mice after 16 h of fasting. To study the magnitude of the effect of PPARα and CREB3L3 ablation on liver gene expression, we performed Volcano plot analysis. Interestingly, the effects of PPARα ablation were much more pronounced as compared to CREB3L3 ablation (Fig. 2a). The combined ablation of PPARα and CREB3L3 had the most significant effect on gene regulation, pointing to a potential additive or synergistic effect of PPARα and CREB3L3 ablation on hepatic gene expression.",015face5-49b5-4f3d-b4bf-008af885517b
17,results4," Analysis of the number of significantly changed genes showed that in the fasted state, loss of PPARα altered the expression of 1097 genes, of which 553 genes were upregulated and 544 genes were downregulated (Fig. 2b). Loss of CREB3L3 altered expression of 312 genes, of which 134 genes were upregulated and 178 genes were downregulated. Combined loss of PPARα and CREB3L3 altered the expression of 1917 genes, of which 1064 genes were upregulated and 853 genes were downregulated (Fig. 2b). The fact that the number of significantly changed genes in the combined PPARα/CREB3L3−/− mice exceeds the sum of significantly changed genes in the PPARα−/− and CREB3L3−/− mice suggests a modest synergistic effect of PPARα and CREB3L3 deficiency on hepatic gene regulation, dominated by PPARα.Fig. 2 Largely independent effect of PPARα and CREB3L3 deficiency on hepatic gene expression in the fasted state.",dc294760-dc55-4bec-9ade-8c0426a518c4

Both analyses indicated the separate clustering of the four experimental groups, with limited variation between the individual mice in each group, and the more pronounced effect of PPARα deficiency compared to CREB3L3 deficiency. In addition, both analyses showed that the whole genome effects of combined PPARα/CREB3L3 deficiency are largely taken up by PPARα deficiency (Fig. 2c, d).",c8e70a23-3d76-4dd5-80da-ffc0a3543ff4
20,results7,"  Hierarchical biclustering of samples and genes visualized in a heatmap further supported the conclusions reached above, showing the much more pronounced effect of PPARα deficiency on hepatic gene expression and the more significant contribution of PPARα towards the effect of combined PPARα/CREB3L3 deficiency (Fig. 2e). The heat map also shows that for certain genes, the effects of PPARα and CREB3L3 deficiency are additive and seemingly independent, whereas for other genes the effect of PPARα and CREB3L3 deficiency appears to be synergistic and thus dependent.  A limited number of genes is commonly downregulated by PPARα and CREB3L3 deficiency in liver during fasting The Venn diagram of significantly downregulated genes (Fig. 3a) and scatter plot analysis (Fig. 3b) confirmed that, in general, the effects of PPARα and CREB3L3 deficiency are disparate, with only a limited number of genes showing similar regulation in PPARα−/− and CREB3L3−/− mice.",2bcc7fbb-cafa-4ab3-b723-251faf0f39cd

Indeed, the enrichment scores of the most highly downregulated genesets in the combined PPARα/CREB3L3−/− mice were very similar in the single PPARα−/− mice, suggesting that the functional impact of combined PPARα/CREB3L3−/− deficiency is mostly accounted for by deficiency of PPARα.",33e46fd3-c7bf-46c9-829e-0b630e11f1e6
30,results17," The exception were two genesets related to lipoprotein and lipid transport, which had similar enrichment scores in the combined PPARα/CREB3L3−/− mice and single CREB3L3−/− mice (Fig. 6d), suggesting that the regulation of these two genesets is driven by CREB3L3 deficiency.  Deficiency of PPARα led to the upregulation of genesets related to the unfolded protein response and inflammatory signalling (Additional file 1: Figure S1A).

Previously, we found that treating mice with the specific PPARα agonist Wy-14,643 markedly induced numerous genesets related to cell cycle [2]. A heatmap of the most highly enriched genes in the geneset Mitotic.M.M.G1 phase underscores the marked induction of cell cycle-related genes by Wy-14,643, which is entirely PPARα dependent (Fig. 10d).

46,discussion0,"In this paper we studied the effect of individual and combined PPARα and CREB3L3 deficiency on hepatic gene expression after a 16-h fast and a 4-day ketogenic diet. Under conditions of overnight fasting, the effect of PPARα deficiency and CREB3L3 deficiency on hepatic gene expression are largely independent, and only show a very limited degree of synergism. A small number of genes is under dual control of PPARα and CREB3L3, including Fgf21 and Mfsd2a. Our data do not support a strong co-dependence of PPARα and CREB3L3 in hepatic gene regulation during fasting. By contrast, a strong interaction between PPARα and CREB3L3 exists during ketogenic diet feeding. Previously, it was shown that CREB3L3−/− mice on a ketogenic diet exhibit a strong phenotype characterized by hepatomegaly and steatohepatitis, and elevated expression of inflammatory marker genes [19, 25]. Here, using whole genome expression profiling, we corroborate these findings.",d1d21234-d3d7-4bf4-a295-dd9afccbe469
47,discussion1," In addition, we show that deficiency of CREB3L3 has virtually no effect on hepatic gene expression in the absence of PPARα, indicating that the major liver phenotype triggered by CREB3L3 deficiency during ketogenic diet is dependent on PPARα. Furthermore, we find that CREB3L3 has a dual impact on PPARα signalling during ketogenic diet. On the one hand, CREB3L3 deficiency leads to reduced expression of PPARα and PPARα target genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. On the other hand, CREB3L3 deficiency leads to the marked activation of the hepatoproliferative effect of PPARα. Overall, our data suggest that CREB3L3 deficiency during ketogenic diet uncouples the mitogenic and lipid metabolic effects of PPARα in the liver.  It is unclear how CREB3L3 deficiency promotes liver damage and hepatoproliferation during ketogenic diet and how this effect is dependent on PPARα.",2cd7d482-3b47-497c-8e90-bb1e2fa99c9c
48,discussion2," It could be envisioned that deficiency of CREB3L3 disrupts a certain metabolic pathway, such as fatty acid oxidation or fatty acid elongation and desaturation, leading to accumulation of intermediate lipid species that ligand-activate PPARα and specifically stimulate the mitogenic action of PPARα. In addition, these lipid species may promote liver damage. Additionally, it is possible that CREB3L3 deficiency alters a specific metabolic pathway, possibly involving accumulation of damaging intermediates, and that these effects are dependent on an enzyme/factor whose expression is maintained by PPARα. Insofar as CREB3L3 and PPARα regulate the expression of many genes, it is not possible to pinpoint the exact causal gene(s) downstream of CREB3L3 and PPARα.  Other examples exist of the uncoupling of the mitogenic and metabolic actions of PPARα.",20b6ed9f-8cf8-4d57-ba71-b7eea3184e28
49,discussion3," For example, human PPARα upregulates genes involved in fatty acid oxidation but not the cell cycle, as shown by studies in mice carrying human PPARα [29, 30]. Another example is the activation of mouse PPARα by dietary n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids, which leads to upregulation of PPARα targets involved in lipid metabolism but does not trigger hepatocyte proliferation [31]. These findings strongly indicate that the mechanisms by which PPARα affects lipid metabolism and hepatocyte proliferation are distinct [29, 30]. Mechanistically, how ligand-activated PPARα could selectively activate mitogenic and not metabolic pathways is unclear but could be related to the SPPARM concept [32–34]. According to this concept, different PPAR agonists have only partially overlapping effects on gene expression based on selective receptor-coregulator interactions.",3b05b1e2-bda1-440a-9d3d-b098aace16e2
50,discussion4," Borrowing from this notion, it can be hypothesized that the epigenetic mechanisms that drive the PPARα-dependent activation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis are different from the epigenetic mechanisms that support the induction of mitogenic pathways by PPARα, and additionally that these mechanisms are differentially affected by CREB3L3 deficiency.  Our data indicate that the roles of PPARα and CREB3L3 in the fasted state are very distinct, showing minimal overlap in target gene regulation (Fig. 11a). As shown by previous whole genome expression analyses and supported by the present paper, PPARα governs the expression of a large number of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, as well as other pathways of intracellular and extracellular lipid metabolism [2]. Reduced fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis causes the commonly observed fasting-induced hypoketonemia and elevated plasma free fatty acid levels in PPARα−/− mice [9–11, 35].",3df38998-87ce-43c9-a538-055b4c10c887
51,discussion5," In the liver, the non-oxidized fatty acids are diverted towards re-esterification, explaining the fasting-induced steatosis in PPARα−/− mice [9–11, 35]. By contrast, CREB3L3 targets apolipoproteins, including Apoa4, Apoc2, Apoa5, and Apoa1 [17, 36]. Reduced expression of the lipoprotein lipase activators Apoc2 and Apoa5, and of Fgf21, which at pharmacological doses has been shown to stimulate plasma triglyceride clearance [37], likely explains the elevated plasma triglyceride levels in CREB3L3−/− mice via reduced plasma triglyceride clearance [17, 25, 36, 38]. This is in line with our previous observation that CREB3L3 deficiency does not significantly influence triglyceride secretion [19].",73b52a6f-df01-417a-9058-24425cd5c323
52,discussion6," Besides targeting lipoprotein metabolism, CREB3L3 regulates a relatively small number of genes involved in several distinct metabolic pathways, including Fabp2 (fatty acid binding), Cidec (lipid storage), fatty acid desaturation (Fads1, Fads2), fatty acid elongation (Elovl2, Elovl5), and gluconeogenesis (G6pc, Pck1) (Fig. 11a) [15–18]. Our data do not support the notion that CREB3L3 has an important role during fasting in regulating genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, with the exception of Cpt1a and Hsd17b10. This is supported by our previous data, showing a lack of effect of CREB3L3 deficiency on ex vivo fatty acid oxidation and fatty acid oxidation genes [19]. In contrast, Nakagawa and colleagues observed that CREB3L3 deficiency in the fasted state reduced expression of many genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, showing synergy with PPARα [25]. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but could be related to the different duration of fasting (16 h vs. 24 h).",8b58e7fd-1ac9-4fdf-b431-ca481bc0e28d
53,discussion7," Interestingly, Cpt1a expression was not downregulated in the fasted state in PPARα−/− mice, which we had also observed in another set of samples [12], despite it being considered as the prototypical PPARα target gene.

55,discussion9," Additional effects of CREB3L3 deficiency include steatosis and enhanced liver damage    An intriguing question is why CREB3L3 deficiency leads to a pronounced phenotype in mice fed a ketogenic but has much more limited effects in fasted mice. Direct comparison of hepatic gene expression in wild-type mice after fasting and ketogenic diet showed that expression of SREBP1 and its target genes involved in lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis was much higher after the ketogenic diet than after fasting (not shown). Previously, it was shown that CREB3L3 is a negative regulator of SREBP-1c production and hepatic lipogenesis [39], which is in line with our observation that genes involved in lipogenesis/cholesterogenesis are highly elevated in CREB3L3−/− mice under regular fasting conditions.",63deaa40-db67-45ff-ba05-17f59771d80b
56,discussion10," Hence, placing CREB3L3−/− mice on a ketogenic diet is expected to lead to markedly increased lipogenesis/cholesterogenesis, which in turn may lead to the generation of a specific (set of) lipids that could trigger the mitogenic effect of PPARα (Fig. 11b). The upregulation of cholesterogenesis upon CREB3L3 deficiency in the fasted state is seemingly at odds with a previous study that suggested that CREB3L3 stimulates lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis [40]. However, closer inspection at the individual gene levels shows substantial correspondence and indicates that CREB3L3 downregulates SREBP-dependent genes.  Despite lower expression of Cidec, which promotes lipid droplet formation [41, 42], PPARα−/−, CREB3L3−/−, and PPARα/CREB3L3−/− mice have elevated hepatic triglyceride levels. Similarly, expression of Plin5, which also promotes hepatic fat storage [43], is lower in PPARα−/− mice, despite these mice showing more pronounced steatosis.",68a1135e-3210-45f4-805d-9ea7139c3336
57,discussion11," Accordingly, these data suggest that the elevated hepatic triglycerides in the PPARα−/−, CREB3L3−/−, and PPARα/CREB3L3−/− mice are not mediated by changes in Cidec and Plin5 expression. It should be noted that an increase in liver triglycerides does not necessarily have to be accompanied by elevated hepatic expression of Cidec and/or Plin5.  One limitation of our study is that we used whole body PPARα−/− and CREB3L3−/− mice. Ideally, it would have been better to use liver-specific PPARα and CREB3L3 deficient mice. Nevertheless, due to the high expression of PPARα and CREB3L3 in liver, we believe the results presented here reflect the hepatic function of the two transcription factors [2, 13]. An additional limitation is that we did not unveil the molecular details of the interaction between PPARα and CREB3L3 during ketogenic diet. These aspects should be further addressed in future studies.",af6ab56d-9946-4662-a5c3-58d82ceb7de7
58,discussion12,"  Conclusion We find that PPARα and CREB3L3 regulate distinct genes in the liver during fasting, with the exception of a limited number of common targets such as Fgf21. Strikingly, deficiency of CREB3L3 in mice during ketogenic diet uncouples the hepatoproliferative and metabolic effects of PPARα. Our data underscore the distinct functions of PPARα and CREB3L3 in the regulation of hepatic gene expression. ",ee642cf8-a6b6-4f26-8c5a-0e8985bf37ae
