0,introduction0,"Neurovascular functions play a critical role in determining cognitive capability and mental health1. Studies have shown that neurovascular risk is highly associated with accelerated decline in language ability, verbal memory, attention and visuospatial abilities2,3. Specifically, reduced cerebral blood flow (cerebral blood flow (CBF)) is linked to increased risk for anxiety, depression, and dementia3–5, while impaired blood-brain-barrier (blood brain barrier (BBB)) function is associated with neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and psychiatric disorders6,7.  Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota play an important role in determining brain vascular integrity. Braniste et al. recently showed that blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability is increased in germ-free mice due to lack of butyrate, a short chain fatty acid (short chain fatty acid (SCFA)) produced by microorganisms such as Clostridium tyrobutyricum8.",b687bcfe-d125-4525-b76b-83efbbf571fc
1,introduction1," Similarly, Akkermansia muciniphila can produce short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s such as acetate and propionate9, and the lack of A. muciniphila can alter the microbial ecology of the mucus layer10 and lead to damage of tight junctions of blood brain barrier (BBB) and the gut7,11. blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction further leads to reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) and impaired clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)1,6. Interventions that maintain gut microbiome and neurovascular integrity may be thus crucial for impeding neurological disorders.  Ketogenic diet (KD), a high fat and low carbohydrate diet, has been an effective therapeutic for a wide range of neurological disorders12. Clinically, KD has been used to treat epilepsy12,13, Parkinson’s disease14, and autism15.",e923f650-4bf3-4e7a-8b6a-3e77ba37b9de
2,introduction2," Furthermore, significant evidence for KD as a therapeutic for a broader range of conditions can be found in preclinical studies where KD has been shown to protect brain function in Alzheimer’s disease16, traumatic brain injury17, and ischemic stroke18. A recent study showed that KD significantly increased regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in a mouse model with ischemic stroke19. In another study with an autism mouse model, KD mitigated neurological symptoms potentially through changes in the gut microbiome20. Collectively, KD may be protective against various neurological disorders, possibly through the restoration of neurovascular function and by maintaining healthy gut microbiome.  While KD has beneficial effects in disease systems, it is unclear if similar impacts persist in healthy conditions.",f511e16e-703b-4e61-a520-ca5c38c8092d
3,introduction3," Therefore, the goal of the study was to identify whether administration of KD to young healthy mice would also benefit their neurovascular functions and gut microbiome composition, and whether these changes could contribute to lowering risk for AD, the most common form of dementia. We were also interested in identifying potential signaling pathways in association with vascular changes induced by KD. We hypothesized that KD would increase neuroprotection for young healthy mice, and reduce their risk for neurodegeneration, by enhancing their neurovascular functions and increasing the abundance of beneficial gut microbiota.

4,methods0,"Animals and Diet We used C57BL/6 male mice (12–14 weeks of age) obtained from the National Institutes of Health. We determined the sample size with the power that could perform the comparison at a 0.05 level of significance, with a 90% chance of detecting a true difference of all the measurements between the two groups; N = 9–10 per group were used in the study. After arriving at our facilities, each mouse was given its own cage housed in a specific pathogen-free facility to avoid microbiome transfer62. The control regimen (type F1515) consisted of 3.79 kcal/gm pellets composed of 65.2% carbohydrates, 18.1% protein, 5.1% fat, 4.8% fiber, 2.9% ash, and less than 10% moisture. The KD regimen (type F3666), in the form of a 7.24 kcal/gm paste, consisted of 75.1% fat (composed of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids), 8.6% protein, 4.8% fiber, 3.2% carbohydrates, 3.0% ash, and less than 10% moisture.

5,methods1," All mice were fed ad libitum for 16 weeks, and body weight was measured once a week. The amount of remaining diet was weighted each week to determine the food intake of the mice. We did not find a significant difference in food intake between the control (46 ± 3 g/mouse/week) and KD mice (47 ± 2 g/mouse/week; p > 0.5). All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)) at the University of Kentucky (UK) and in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines63.  Cerebral Blood Flow Measurement We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based arterial spin labeling techniques. Details have been described in a previous study23.

A water bath with circulating water at 45–50 °C was used to maintain the body temperature. A whole-body volume coil was used for transmission and a mouse brain surface coil was placed on top of the head for receiving. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) techniques23. Paired control and label images were acquired in an interleaved fashion with a train of Hanning window-shaped radiofrequency pulses of duration/spacing = 200/200 μs, flip angle = 25° and slice-selective gradient = 9 mT/m, and a labeling duration = 2100 ms.",052c412c-9e65-4858-ad98-04e65de9518c

Genomic DNA was PCR amplified with primers 515 F modified and 926R65 targeting the V4-V5 regions of microbial 16S rRNA genes using a two-stage “targeted amplicon sequencing (Targeted amplicon sequencing (TAS))” protocol66. The primers contained 5′ common sequence tags (known as common sequence 1 and 2, CS1 and CS2) as described previously67. First stage amplifications were performed with the following thermocycling conditions: 95 °C for 3 mins, 28 cycles of 95 °C for 45 sec, 50 °C for 45 sec, 72 °C for 1:30 minutes and final elongation at 72 °C for 10 minutes.

Each well received a separate primer pair with a unique 10-base barcode, obtained from the Access Array Barcode Library for Illumina (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA; Item# 100-4876). These Access Array primers contained the CS1 and CS2 linkers at the 3′ ends of the oligonucleotides. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 minutes, followed by 8 cycles of 95 °C for 30”, 60 °C for 30” and 72 °C for 30”. A final, 7-minute elongation step was performed at 72 °C.

Sequences were then trimmed based on quality scores using a modified Mott algorithm with PHRED quality threshold of p = 0.01, and sequences shorter than 300 bases after trimming were discarded. QIIME v1.8 was used to generate OTU tables and taxonomic summaries24. Briefly, the resulting sequence files were merged with sample information. OTU clusters were generated in a de novo manner using the UCLUST algorithm with a 97% similarity threshold69. Chimeric sequences were identified using the USEARCH61 algorithm with the GreenGenes 13_8 reference sequences70. Taxonomic annotations for each OTU were using the UCLUST algorithm and GreenGenes 13_8 reference with a minimum similarity threshold of 90%69,70.",6af1d5ff-e262-4e21-94c0-5bf22fd0405f

The taxonomic summary tables were then rarefied to a depth of 10,000 counts per sample.  Shannon and Bray-Curtis indices were calculated with default parameters in software package Primer771. The rarefied species data, taxonomic level 6, were used to calculate both indices. Significant difference among tested groups was determined using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance. The group significance tests were performed on the rarefied species data using the group_significance.py script within the QIIME v1.8 package.

20,results0,"Ketogenic diet enhances neurovascular functions We used magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and confocal microscopy to determine blood brain barrier (BBB) function. Figure 1a shows representative cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps superimposed on structural brain images. The color code indicates the level of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in a linear scale. We found that KD-fed mice had significantly elevated cerebral blood flow (CBF) globally and regionally, particularly in ventromedial hypothalamus (ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH)) (11.82%; p < 0.0001; Fig. 1b).

KD mice exhibited reduced body weight by week 3 (Fig. 3d; −15.50%; p = 0.0096), and this trend continued for the remainder of the study. At the time of the final measurement, the KD mice maintained significantly lower weights than the control mice (−14.58%; p = 0.0042). Our findings are consistent with literature that KD reduces blood glucose levels33 and body weight34.Figure 3 Ketogenic diet modulates blood ketone and glucose, and decreases body weight.",c5dae1d6-79f6-46d9-aabd-0ac1702ee4c4

31,discussion0,"In the present study, we demonstrated that KD enhanced neurovascular functions and increased beneficial gut microbiota in young healthy mice. In particular, KD enhanced blood brain barrier (BBB) function by increasing protein expression and transport activity of the Aβ transporter P-gp, increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), and reduced mTOR with increased eNOS protein expressions. In addition, KD increased potentially beneficial gut microorganisms, including A. muciniphila and bacteria from the genus Lactobacillus. KD also reduced potentially pro-inflammatory taxa, including bacteria from the genera Desulfovibrio and Turicibacter. We also found that mice fed with KD had reduced blood glucose levels and body weight, and increased blood ketone body levels; there was an inverse correlation between blood glucose and ketone bodies levels. Collectively, KD showed multifactorial benefits for mice even under healthy conditions.",6619583b-cc45-43f5-bf40-581f91988027
32,discussion1,"  The enhancements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood brain barrier (BBB) transporter activities, and potentially increased Aβ clearance suggest that mice with KD may have lower risk to develop age-related neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. This is consistent with literature that KD reduces Aβ toxicity and restores memory in animal models that develop AD-like symptoms35–38. This also agrees with our previous findings showing that preserving cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity is critical in preventing AD development in a mouse model with human APOE4 gene, the strongest genetic risk factor for AD39; and restoring cerebral blood flow (CBF) improves memory in a symptomatic AD mouse model21. Our findings are consistent with literature showing that an acute increase in ketone body levels elevated cerebral blood flow (CBF) in rats37 and humans36.  We further demonstrate that mTOR inhibition may play an important role in neurovascular enhancements.",25513c1e-222d-410a-ab02-291321f42bb2
33,discussion2," mTOR is a nutrient sensor and its activity can be down-regulated when glucose availability is reduced or ketogenesis is increased40. Similar to caloric restriction, mTOR inhibition can preserve brain metabolism with age41, potentially due to the shift from glucose to ketone body utilization42. In the present study, we found that KD mice exhibited significantly lower expression of mTOR, but significantly increased expression of eNOS. This is consistent with our previous study using rapamycin, showing that mTOR inhibition can activate eNOS, which causes the release of nitric oxide, a vessel dilator, and consequently elevates cerebral blood flow (CBF)21,23. This is also consistent with studies showing that down-regulation of mTOR is associated with elevated P-gp expression23. The neurovascular enhancements by mTOR inhibition were associated with preserved white matter integrity and long-term memory, and reduced anxiety in aging mice23,43.",ca1cfc96-19ca-43c2-ab4a-3436d23a1e85
34,discussion3,"  Gut microbiome alterations induced by KD may also contribute to the neurovascular enhancements. We found that KD significantly increased the relative abundance of A. muciniphila and Lactobacillus, known to produce short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s25–27. short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s are transported by monocarboxylate transporters expressed at the blood brain barrier (BBB)44,45. Lack of short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s can cause higher blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability7,8,11. On the other hand, we found that Desulfovibrio was absent in KD mice. This is consistent with a prior study showing that KD significantly decreases the abundance of Desulfovibrio in Glucose Transporter 1 Deficiency Syndrome29. Members of the genus Desulfovibrio are capable of respiring sulfate and producing hydrogen sulfide, which is known to induce gut barrier impairment46. Consequently, reducing the abundance of Desulfovibrio may also facilitate blood brain barrier (BBB) and neurovascular enhancements.",b510623c-3551-48e1-9991-6ceea6ef0451
35,discussion4," Together, changes in relative abundance of A. muciniphila, Lactobacillus, and Desulfovibrio may contribute to protection of neurovascular functions.  We found that KD decreased overall microbial diversity. This is likely a result of reduced carbohydrate intake, which decreases the polysaccharide content that many gut bacteria derive energy from47. Although other studies suggested that reduced microbiome diversity may be associated with disease progression48, we found that levels of several beneficial microbiota were increased, even though the overall diversity was reduced by KD. In part, the decrease in diversity (Shannon index) can be attributed to the substantially higher relative abundance of A. muciniphila in KD mice, reaching nearly 20% of the observed microbial community. Future studies are needed to further identify the different contributions between overall diversity and underlying taxonomy for health and diseases.",81bf3a45-30d0-4418-b639-cca777d26b4a
36,discussion5," In addition, shotgun metagenome and metatranscriptome sequencing efforts will be required to associate specific metabolic capabilities (e.g., short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s production) with identified taxa, and to demonstrate where and when these genes are expressed in situ in the gastrointestinal tract.  We confirmed that KD is able to reduce body weight34 and lower blood glucose level33. This could be due to increased relative abundance of A. muciniphila and Lactobacillus spp. The relative abundance of A. muciniphila also increases when type 2 diabetic patients are given metformin49, a prescribed medication to increase glucose utilization and reduce body weight by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) pathway50. Accordingly, A. muciniphila is associated with increased insulin sensitivity31 and reduced body weight32. Similar results could be elicited by Lactobacillus through short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s production.",020e3617-0308-4466-bf23-cf77284124a5
37,discussion6," In line with this, Lactobacillus has been shown in several studies to decrease body weight and fat51.  Being able to maintain proper body weight and blood glucose level is crucial for reducing risk for AD, which is known as type 3 diabetes with increased glucose intolerance in the brain52. In fact, diabetes or obesity is highly associated with glucose intolerance, insulin insensitivity, and increased risk for AD53. Recent advances indicate that excessive white fat increases secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from adipocytes, which could consequently lead to neuroinflammation, Aβ retention, brain cell death, and dementia54. In a study with obese rats, KD reduced their body weight and improved their lipid profile55. In addition, KD decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α), down-regulates brain amyloid protein precursor, and improves brain oxidative stress of the obese rats.",78ceb779-0d30-46e9-b35a-67985f44f071
38,discussion7," Furthermore, KD improves hippocampal glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and amino acid in a 3xTgAD mouse model56, suggesting that KD may also improve insulin sensitivity in the brain57. It indicates that KD-induced body weight loss may evoke metabolic and immune function changes that potentially lead to neuroprotective effects. This is consistent with a human study that diet-induced weight loss improves functional brain responses during an episodic memory task58.  Although KD mice had higher energy intake per gram of the food (due to high fat content) compared to the control mice, they still showed lower body weight. As ketone bodies could enhance fatty acid metabolism, we speculate that KD would switch from burning carbohydrate to fat and thus facilitate fat utilization more effectively in the body59. This is consistent with a clinical study that people with obesity lost three times more visceral adipose tissue with KD60.",56358c84-acea-419a-81cf-5da15d729aec
39,discussion8,"  There were several limitations in the present study. We did not measure levels of short chain fatty acid (SCFA)s, and tight junction protein in the intestinal barrier and blood brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, we could not identify further linkages between the gut microbiome changes and brain vascular protection. In addition, we used DNA-based amplicon profiling of the microbial community in fecal samples to determine the diversity and taxonomy of gut microbiota. We acknowledge that the various compartments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract harbor different bacterial populations61; therefore, future studies will need to include different parts of the GI tracts for gut microbiome analysis, and to incorporate shotgun sequencing approaches to the community profiling to improve taxonomic resolution and to measure gene expression activity.",700742c4-2f10-4f5c-9da7-181315bff0b4
40,discussion9,"  In conclusion, we have demonstrated that KD enhanced neurovascular functions, which might be associated with the diet-induced changes in gut microbiome. Our results indicate that KD may not only be beneficial in disease states, but also in healthy condition. These findings imply that dietary intervention started in early stages may evoke neuroprotective effects via neurovascular and gut microbiome changes. Future studies will be needed to further identify the mechanism linking brain and gut interactions for KD-induced neuroprotective effects in both healthy and disease states. Understanding nutritional effects on central and enteric nervous systems, and their interactions, has profound implications for neuroprotection in humans.  ",fdc518c8-e980-4112-9e8e-3fc0d9cbea7b
