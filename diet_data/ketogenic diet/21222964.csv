0,background0,"Obesity has become a health emergency in Western countries [1,2]. As is well known, obesity and in particular abdominal obesity is one of the principle risk factors for cardiovascular disease and along with dyslipidemia, hypertension and diabetes contributes to the metabolic syndrome [3]. Even though weight loss is a desired goal for most overweight individuals, and its health benefits have been clearly determined [4,5], there are still no definitive data on what dietary protocols are most effective in both the short and long term [6] or even what is the correct nutritional approach in general [7].  The most commonly accepted dietary strategy is based on relatively high levels of carbohydrates and low fat content but according to some studies these low fat diets yield only modest weight loss and suffer from low long-term compliance [8].",7546e2b4-e08d-4e6d-9205-442012db3190
1,background1," In fact adherence of overweight/obese individuals to high carbohydrate/low fat nutrition is often a problem because the majority have been shown to have dietary preferences for foods with a rich fat content. Furthermore rather than consume complex carbohydrates there is a tendency to prefer highly processed food containing simple sugars [9-11] such that a low fat diet can actually encourage the consumption of sugars and refined carbohydrates that can worsen weight problems and also facilitate dyslipidemia especially in insulin resistance individuals [12,13]. As a consequence of the relative inefficacy of these types of diet there has been increased interest in recent years in very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD)) [14] that, have undoubtedly been shown to be effective, at least in the short to medium term, as a tool to tackle obesity, hyperlipidemia and some cardiovascular risk factors [15-18].",fcdb93f6-fdee-45c2-a2fd-86e21417e459
2,background2," The Mediterranean diet is often proposed as the healthy standard but many of the advantages associated with it can actually be linked to life style and the true original Mediterranean diet did not contemplate the current high levels of refined carbohydrates on which the typical Italian diet is based [19,20]. For this reason the standard ketogenic diet is not associated with high compliance in populations, like the Italian, that are used to carbohydrate based diets. The objective of the present study, which was devised as a case pilot trial, is to assess the safety, compliance and effects of a ""Mediterranean style"" ketogenic diet that utilizes very low carbohydrate ingredients formulated to simulate the aspect and taste of common carbohydrate rich foods (e.g. pasta) and which contain phytoextracts intended to add beneficial effects of important vegetable components.",40aa2d8b-a023-4f7a-92c5-56a4ac40453b

After the start of the experimental protocol the subjects who began new exercise programs or pharmaceutical treatments would be excluded. A small rise in transaminase was not considered a condition for exclusion since mild alterations in GOT and GPT values are common in obese individuals.

11,methods7," A separate sample of blood was clotted and serum analyzed for total cholesterol and triacylglycerols by photometric assay with an intra-assay and interassay CV values of 2% and 4%, respectively.

12,methods8," Bioelectrical impedance analysis was chosen for the analysis of body composition due to its reliability, safety, convenience and non-invasiveness making it optimal for the routine monitoring of body composition during the ketogenic diet [25,26].

15,discussion0,"Many weight loss diet procedures continue to focus on the reduction of fat content and controlled protein intake, however our results appear to demonstrate that the ketogenic Mediterranean with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet, which is a modification of the very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD), is effective not only for weight and fat loss but also leads to improvements in the values of various biomarkers which are associated with increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. The weight loss effect of very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD) diets may be caused by several factors:  1. Satiety effect of proteins leading to appetite reduction [28-36] in which also ketone bodies may have a role [37,38], although the mechanism is not clear [39];  2. Reduction in lipid synthesis and increased lipolysis mechanisms [40-44];  3. Reduction in at rest respiratory quotient and therefore an increase in fat metabolism for energy use [22,45];  4.",7feef220-bfeb-43a2-bb46-d48750a05495
16,discussion1," Increased metabolic expenditure caused by gluconeogenesis and the thermic effect of proteins [46-51]  The beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors involve the reduction of blood triglycerides [17,18,22] and also the reduction of total and LDL cholesterol along with a rise in HDL cholesterol [17,18,22,52-54]. Furthermore the very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD) can cause modifications in LDL-C particles leading to increased size [53] which may reduce cardiovascular risk since smaller LDL particles have been shown to be more atherogenic [55].  The cholesterol lowering effect of very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is also mediated by the well known facilitating action of insulin on HMGCoA reductase and inhibition of the latter by cholesterol and fats [56]. Insulin then increases the production of endogenous cholesterol while exogenous cholesterol has the opposite effect [56].",dbb66234-7927-4069-a3b9-5407bbc3f026
17,discussion2,"  The ketogenic Mediterranean with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet protocol used in this study maintains some advantages of the Mediterranean diet such as the use of olive oil [21] and some vegetables [19] (selected to avoid stimulating insulin production) but at the same time by inducing a physiological ketosis [57] promotes beneficial modifications in cardiovascular risk factors and body composition [22]. The use of the phyoextracts in this study may have contributed to the absence of commonly reported mild effects of ketosis (e.g. weakness, constipation, bad breath, headache). During the first three weeks of the ketogenic Mediterranean with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) diet subjects avoided fructose completely and during the second three weeks only a moderate amount of fructose, exclusively from fruit, and therefore together with starch, was permitted.",633bde3b-c666-44ab-b18f-27b3d85840e7
18,discussion3," As a matter of fact fructose may stimulate fat biosynthesis via mechanisms which are not yet fully characterised [58], also several studies have reported that excessive concentrations of fructose can induce some or all of the features of metabolic syndrome independently of energy intake. Clinical and epidemiologic data further suggest that excessive fructose intake can contribute to the causes of metabolic syndrome [59].  Adjusted compliance in this study was 93.4% which is higher than reported compliances of standard VLCK diets (in the 20% to 58% range). [22,60,61]. It is tempting to speculate that the inclusion of ""carbohydrate-like"" formulated foods is one of the reasons for high compliance - however this, along with the potential benefits of the phytoextracts, requires further verification in a future study with a matched control group.",5f100c26-0186-44c6-b1a3-238d430d19cd
19,discussion4,"  Safety considerations If we assimilate de facto, which is not always correct, ketogenic diets with high protein diets then the risks proposed by critics of this type of dietary approach are essentially those of possible kidney damage due to high levels of nitrogen excretion during protein metabolism which can cause an increase in glomerular pressure and hyper-filtration [27]. There is not wide agreement between studies however, some infer the possibility of renal damage from animal studies [62,63] while others, looking at both animal models and human studies propose that even high levels of protein in the diet do not damage renal function [64,65]. In subjects with intact renal function higher dietary protein levels caused some functional and morphological adaptations without negative effects [66].",d716e2a8-6499-49ec-b7c8-2d177beaedb1
20,discussion5," Also it should be underlined that ketogenic diets are only relatively high in protein [49,67] and that some recent studies have demonstrated that very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD) can even cause a regression of diabetic nephropathy in mice [68]. With regard to possible acidosis during very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD) since the concentration of ketone bodies never rises above 8 mmol/l [40,42] this risk is virtually inexistent in subjects with healthy insulin function.  Conclusions Some limitations to this study include the lack of a matched control group and the short trial period. There are though many studies that demonstrate that VLCK diets are more effective than low fat or standard Mediterranean diets, at least over the short term [21], and the main aims of the present initial study were to assess safety aspects, acceptance & palatability and weight loss & biomarker changes.",a3d1b889-cd31-4f32-94c4-a3f92c4ce529
21,discussion6," We are able to conclude that at least in the short term it was able to lead to positive changes including the reduction of fasting blood glucose, improvements in lipid profiles, significant and rapid weight and fat loss with the preservation of lean mass. We also note a high level of compliance, whether this was due to specific unique features of the present diet requires confirmation in a future matched control trial.
