0,background0," The ketogenic diet (KD) has anti-tumor and anti-diabetic effects in addition to its anti-epileptic role. It could also improve cardiac function and attenuate neurological insult. However, the effect of KD on blood perfusion or tissue recovery after ischemia remains largely unknown. Thus, we observed blood flow and ischemic tissue recovery following hind limb ischemia (hind limb ischemia (HLI)) in mice. ",fad6b1d6-f882-4ce5-b408-a47859fcc030

Perfusion was assayed by laser Doppler perfusion imaging on days 0, 7, and 21 following femoral artery ligation surgery. We observed that the KD reduced perfusion signals associated with more pronounced non-perfusion signals in ischemic limbs than in mice fed with ND on days 7 and 21 (Fig. 2A). Quantitatively, the ratio of perfusion between ischemic and non-ischemic limbs for each mouse was calculated and it was found that the perfusion ratio was 86.2% at the 3-week point in the ND group, whereas it was only 52.4% in the KD group. There were no significant differences between the two groups on day 0, indicating slow recovery of limb circulation caused by KD (Fig. 2B). To assess the angiogenic effect, capillary density was measured.",b417f2ea-5263-41a6-9533-4e0c6a51ba47

The micrographs showed that ischemic limbs of KD-fed mice displayed reduced capillary density (less red CD31 ( +) signal), indicating reduced angiogenesis (Fig. 2D). This was confirmed by western blot (WB) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) results of CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor A (vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)), two common indicators of tissue revascularization [22]. By performing qPCR, mRNA level of both CD31 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) was found to be significantly reduced in the ischemic hind limb tissue of mice in the KD group compared with those in the ND group (Fig. 2E).",bdbb47e8-6f7f-44a7-aabb-a3766e30b69e

An obvious muscle atrophy of gastrocnemius was observed on both legs of KD mice compared with those of mice in the ND group (Fig. 3A).",b12a651b-5fda-46fc-8082-a8bbc97de790
14,results6," To further confirm muscle atrophy in KD mice, gastrocnemius muscle mass was then assessed. The net weight of both ischemic and lateral gastrocnemius muscles of mice in the KD group was found to be significantly decreased compared with that of mice in the ND group, indicating that KD not only induced muscle atrophy of the ischemic limb but also caused atrophy in non-ischemic muscle (Fig. 3B). Muscle recovery rate was analyzed by calculating the ratio of ischemic gastrocnemius muscle weight to lateral gastrocnemius muscle weight of each mouse and the recovery ability of the gastrocnemius muscle after ischemia was found to be reduced in KD mice compared with mice in the ND group (Fig. 3C). Effect of KD on muscle regeneration ability was further assessed by H&E staining of the gastrocnemius muscle of the ischemic hind limb.

We found mRNA expression levels of both FOXO3 and LC3 genes were significantly increased in ischemic hind limb tissue of mice in the KD group (Fig. 3F) compared with mice in the ND group, indicating that upregulation of muscle atrophy related genes by KD may be one of the causes for muscle atrophy observed in our study.Fig. 3 Quantitative analysis of gastrocnemius muscle atrophy.",a4452670-d836-47d8-b5e7-a4f334eb5c0e

17,results9," Images of wound closure in mice 28 days after hind limb surgery showed that the surgical wound of each mouse in the ND group healed completely when inflammatory and purulent exudation was observed at the surgical wound of mice in the KD group, indicating that KD significantly delayed wound healing and caused inflammation around the surgical sites (Fig. 4A). Severe toe necrosis in KD mice was also observed and the necrosis ratio of toes in the two groups was analyzed using necrosis score (1 point for toenail blackening, 3 points for toe necrosis, and 5 points for foot having fallen off). Ratio of toe necrosis of mice in the KD group was higher than mice in the ND group (Fig. 4B). H&E staining also revealed massive inflammatory cell infiltration in ischemic hind limb tissue in the KD group, while there was no sign of inflammation in the ND group (Fig. 4C).",28ce84fa-3ddb-41d9-8a75-691bf99c3595

Therefore, expression level of inflammation-related genes (IL-β, IL-6, and IL-18) was examined in the ischemic hind limb tissue of mice in the ND and KD groups and found that expression level of inflammatory genes was significantly decreased in ischemic limb tissues of mice in the KD group compared with mice in the ND group (Fig. 4E).Fig. 4 Effects of KD on wound healing in chronic hindlimb ischemia.",6d73c042-5a62-4929-bc9f-7ea5317db3b6

Both Cola2 and α-SMA mRNA expression levels increased in the ischemic limb tissue of mice in the KD group compared with those in the ND group (Fig. 5C). Moreover, this was consistent with the finding of increased α-SMA protein expression in ischemic tissue of mice in the KD group (Fig. 5D). A slight increase in α-SMA protein expression was also found in non-ischemic tissue of mice in the KD group compared to that of mice in the ND group, indicating that KD can also trigger fibrosis without an ischemic condition.Fig. 5 Effect of KD on fibrosis of hind limb tissue in chronic hindlimb ischemia.",f02bac4f-7f8b-4c69-8b91-24825747fba7

Ketolysis was simultaneously reduced by decreased BHD1 and SCOT gene expression in KD mice, while there was no significant difference in ketogenesis between the two groups represented by HMGCS2 gene expression (Fig. 6C). qPCR performed subsequently in ischemic limb tissues of mice in the two groups on day 7 after ischemic surgery showed that KD further decreased glycolysis in limb tissue after ischemia (Fig. 6D).

However, PDK1 protein, an inhibitor of glycolysis, showed increased expression in hind limb tissue both before and after ischemia in KD mice, with a greater increase in ischemic tissue than that in mice in the ND group (Fig. 7E).

28,discussion0," We conducted this experiment to observe how KD affects blood perfusion and tissue recovery after hind limb ischemia in mice. We found that KD impaired angiogenesis and blood recovery of hind limb tissue after ischemia in mice, induced muscle atrophy, and delayed wound healing. An aggravated inflammation and accelerated fibrosis was also observed in ischemic limb tissue in mice fed with KD. These findings indicate that KD impairs the blood recovery process of tissues under ischemia and increases the risk of delayed tissue recovery after an ischemia. It also highlights the possibility that muscle atrophy develops under a KD. Our results hint that patients with limb ischemia may need to avoid KD.  We found a significant decrease in the body weight of mice after 2 weeks of KD feeding. Effect of KD on weight loss was well established in previous studies and used as a tool to fight obesity in clinic at least in the short to medium term [25, 26].",d631c653-7560-486e-b457-2cf69256db8b
29,discussion1," But due to its poor maintainability, few clinical studies show long term interventions with a ketogenic diet, thus the further research is warranted. Previously Kozue et al. and Evan et al. reported that prolonged KD did not affect body weight in mice [27, 28], indicating that KD causes a rapid drop in body weight, but then it gradually returns to the initial level, and may even increase afterwards. There are several hypothesized mechanisms for its weight loss effect including reduction in appetite, reduction in lipogenesis and increased lipolysis, increased metabolic costs of gluconeogenesis and greater metabolic efficiency in consuming fats [29, 30], but how KD really causes weight loss still remains unknown. While the effect of KD on blood ketone levels is already established, its effect on blood glucose regulation is known to treat diabetes [31].",0c0eb66d-b302-4fc2-896b-ec813cbb13f2
30,discussion2," We found that KD causes a rapid change in blood metabolite levels at the beginning of the study then returns slightly towards the initial level and remains stable thereafter. The same fluctuation pattern of blood ketone level and blood glucose level was noticed in clinical trials [32]. Interestingly, we found that ketone content in the liver of KD mice was not significantly different from that mice in the ND group; however, ketone levels of muscle and heart tissues in KD mice were higher than those in ND mice,indicating an increased ketone metabolism in heart and muscle tissue of KD mice as they are known to be the major consumers of ketones.  Most importantly, we found that KD impaired angiogenesis and blood recovery after hind limb ischemia in mice, consistent with the finding of decreased angiogenesis in tumors by a calorie-restricted diet [18, 19].",0144c60c-daf7-4422-a06f-a048edc28e4f
31,discussion3," An indispensable contribution of ketone metabolism to lymph vessel formation in vivo reported in previous study indicates that ketones are not merely a metabolite [21] so whether metabolic state under a KD effects angiogenesis of ischemic tissues needs to be investigated. In our study, we found that KD not only reduced blood perfusion in ischemic hind limb tissue but also decreased CD31 + number and downregulated the expression level of CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) proteins, further indicating the reduced angiogenesis in ischemic limb tissues. Based on the results of reduced CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression in ischemic limb tissue of KD mice, we hypothesized that endothelial cells might play a major role in the process of reduced angiogenesis; however the mechanism of KD,s effect on angiogenesis needs further studies.",4e9f2cc5-6a47-426f-8f08-29b9f1a008da
32,discussion4,"  We observed muscle atrophy of both ischemic and non-ischemic limb muscles in mice under a KD based on visual inspection of muscle shape and mass along with microscopic observations. Our findings are consistent with the results of another study which also reported that KD induces muscle atrophy in mice [33]. This study also reported that KD induced muscle atrophy in mice through upregulating muscle atrophy related genes; therefore we further assessed the expression level of these genes in ischemic limb tissue and found mRNA expression levels of both FOXO3 and LC3 genes were significantly increased in ischemic hind limb tissue of mice in the KD group, indicating that upregulation of muscle atrophy related genes by KD may be one of the causes for muscle atrophy observed in our study.",ef3c50e2-7228-41d0-aca7-85fe32d76d7c
33,discussion5," However, whether KD also causes muscle waste during weight loss and further contributes to the muscle atrophy was not detected in our study, therefore it still needs further studies to determine the causes for muscle atrophy induced in mice under KD.  Reduced wound healing caused by calorie-restricted diet has been reported previously [34]; therefore we evaluated the wound healing after hind limb ischemia and observed that KD delayed wound healing in mice when it also increased the toe necrosis rate and induced severe inflammation at wound sites. Our findings of impaired wound healing and toe necrosis in mice can be explained by the reduced angiogenesis caused by KD. Anti-inflammatory effect of KD was established by previous studies through reducing inflamasomes and pro-inflammatory cytokines [24, 35].",c81d5b56-3fd6-4492-b344-a169fd983aa0
34,discussion6," Similarly, gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-β, IL-6, and IL-18) were found to be decreased in ischemic limb tissues of mice in KD group in our study, further supporting the anti-inflammatory effect of KD. However we found an aggravated infection at the wound site and accelerated inflammation in the ischemic limb tissue underneath in KD mice. Due to studies, reducing pro-inflammatory state of tissues is considered to be treatment for diseases those were under a prolonged pro-inflammatory state like diabetes, atherosclerosis, autoimmune disease and obesity [36]. However maintaining and even inducing pro-inflammatory state of tissue to kill pathogens may be crucial for treating infections, not to mention depletion of pro-inflammatory cytokines may increase the lethality during infections [37–40].",4f9ee04d-4f27-423d-8749-7ca6e8663dbc
35,discussion7," Thus reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines by KD is considered to be the reason for the aggravated inflammation and infections found in KD mice in our study, when it can also explain the impaired wound healing and toe necrosis.  A previous study reported that KD induced cardiac fibrosis in mice [41]; therefore, we evaluated fibrosis of ischemic limb tissue by Masson staining, and found that KD accelerated fibrosis in limb tissue after ischemia. We then found an increased gene expression of Cola2 and α-SMA followed by an elevated α-SMA protein level, with a further indication of fibrosis induced by KD. It needs further studies to determine the effect of KD on fibrosis and its potential mechanism.  Finally, we studied the metabolic status before and after ischemia by examining the gene and protein expression of metabolic enzymes and transporters.",c23005dd-1fe0-4507-96af-1be7d028ea18
36,discussion8," We found that KD significantly decreased glucose uptake by down regulating glucose transporter (GLUT1 and GLUT4) expression both at gene and protein levels in hind limb tissues, and this was further aggregated by ischemia. Same result was found for HK2, while PDK1 was upregulated by KD both at gene and protein levels, indicating that KD also decreases glycolysis in limb tissue. We also examined CD36 and CPT1 expression, and found that KD increased fatty acid uptake in limb tissue before ischemia but decreased its uptake after ischemia, indicating that ischemia interferes with the effect of KD on fatty acid uptake by limb tissue.",8d7457f6-79e2-4fed-93e8-88e668b2324d
37,discussion9," Decreased ketolysis in muscle tissue in KD mice has been reported [27], thus we evaluated the effect of KD on ketone metabolism in limb tissue before and after ischemia, and we found that KD decreased ketolysis but did not affect ketogenesis of limb tissue before ischemia, while it further decreased ketolysis and increased ketogenesis after ischemia of limb tissue, indicating that ischemia accelerates KD’s impact on ketone metabolism. In our study we found that KD increased fatty acid oxidation while it decreased glucose and ketone utilization by limb tissue, but after ischemia KD overall decreased the catabolic metabolism in limb tissue, indicating that hypoxia caused by ischemia accelerated KD,s impact on catabolic metabolism of limb tissue; moreover we assume that the reduced energy metabolism of limb tissue may further contribute to the impaired tissue recovery of hind limb under ischemia.",f5d35f12-249f-4061-ae9c-0c4a13bda24c
38,discussion10," However the underlying mechanism of altered metabolism by KD under normoxic and hypoxic environment needs further studies.  Limitations  We found weight loss on mice with a short term KD, but we did not observe its long term effect on body weight of mice when the food intake or calorie intake of mice should also be calculated in order to investigate the causes of wight loss induced by KD. Only male mice were used in our study, and it still needs further studies on both sex to identify whether KD,s impact on mice is sex related. To investigate the metabolic alteration of limb tissue we used gene and protein expression of metabolic enzymes while their enzymatic activity are also of important and needs precise evaluation in future studies.
