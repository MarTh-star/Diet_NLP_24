0,introduction0,"The ketogenic diet, a high-fat diet with low or absent carbohydrate, mimics the fasting state of the body [1]. This diet increases ketone production from the liver and shifts energy sources to fat instead of carbohydrate [2–6]. The generated ketone is used eventually as an energy substrate in different organs such as the brain and skeletal muscles.  Earlier studies have been undertaken to elucidate therapeutic effects of a ketogenic diet on the central nervous system. For example, a ketogenic diet is regarded as an alternative treatment to anticonvulsants for a patient with pharmacoresistant or medication-intolerant epilepsy [7–10]. Although the precise mechanism remains unknown, this effect is reportedly associated with a change in the vesicular glutamate transporter activity and quantal size in the vesicle at hippocampal synapses [11].",6a101352-6f11-42b5-9e34-9eee743882f5
1,introduction1," Furthermore, proposals for clinical application of a ketogenic diet have targeted amelioration of different diseases including hyperglycemia in diabetes [12–15], cardiomyopathy with glycogen storage disease type III [16, 17], cancer development [4, 18], and age-related brain dysfunction [19].  Skeletal muscle, in addition to supporting locomotion and respiration, is an important organ for whole-body metabolism [3, 20]. Recent reports of the relevant literature have described effects of a ketogenic diet on rodent skeletal muscle metabolic characteristics. Kephart et al. found that rats fed a ketogenic diet for 8 months exhibited decreased mitochondrial respiration capacity of gastrocnemius muscle [21]. Schnyder et al. reported that mice fed a ketogenic diet for 12 weeks showed lowered mitochondrial ATP production in gastrocnemius muscle [5]. In contrast to these reports of other studies, Shimizu et al.",531ea5c1-f766-4954-a0c6-23d46f722807
2,introduction2," reported that mice fed a ketogenic diet for 12 weeks showed upregulated transcript levels of fatty acid oxidation in gastrocnemius muscle [22]. Therefore, the effect of ketogenic diet on muscle metabolic characteristics is contradictory. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether a ketogenic diet can affect skeletal muscle performance, which is associated with muscle metabolic characteristics.  Therefore, this study was conducted to clarify ketogenic diet effects on muscle force production and fatigability in isolated rat extensor digitorum longus (extensor digitorum longus (EDL)) muscle. Additionally, to clarify biochemical and metabolic adaptation to the ketogenic diet, this study investigated muscle fiber types and metabolic enzymes for glucose and fat utilization.

They were conducted according to guiding principles of the Physiological Society of Japan for the care and use of animals in the field of physiological sciences.  Animal care and experiment design From a licensed laboratory animal vendor (Japan Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Yokohama, Japan), 32 male Wistar rats (7 weeks old) were obtained. Upon arrival at our institution, all animals were provided with standard rodent food and water ad libitum. They were housed in an environmentally controlled room (24 ± 1°C, 55 ± 5% relative humidity: 12:12 h light-dark photoperiods (lights off 1800–0600)). Following a week of acclimation, the animals were assigned to a control diet group (control group (CON), n = 16) or to a ketogenic diet group (KD, n = 16).",2dbf2179-1c03-417f-94ac-04849e2cb245
4,methods3," Ltd.). Then the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle was removed, weighed, and frozen for subsequent analyses. For this study, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle was selected because it is a fast-twitch fiber muscle similar to the gastrocnemius and quadriceps femoris muscles, which have been used often in earlier ketogenic diet studies [22, 24–26]. Also, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle is suitable to isolate with tendon-to-tendon manner for performing muscle contraction experiments.  The animals were euthanized by removal of the heart after extensor digitorum longus (EDL) removal. The removed muscle was used to measure muscle glycogen, muscle fiber types, and muscle protein expression (control group (CON), n = 5; KD, n = 5). The protein expression included representative metabolic enzymes for glucose and fat utilization, myosin heavy chain (MyHC) type II isoforms, and potent regulatory factors for muscle oxidative metabolism and muscle fiber type.",37ee64ed-5911-43a4-9525-b3b86f4d94b5

Each measurement was taken spectrophotometrically (412 nm) in triplicate using a microplate reader (Multiskan MS; Life Technologies Inc.). The close two values were used for analyses. The activity was expressed as the specific activity corrected with the protein concentration of the supernatant (mM·min-1·mg protein-1).

11,methods11," After the muscle was powdered in liquid nitrogen, it was lysed in NaOH (1M) at 25°C for 5 min, followed by incubation at 85°C for 10 min. After HCl (6 M) was added (1:2), the mixture was incubated further at 85°C for 2 h. Finally, NaOH (4M) was added (1:2) to neutralize the lysate. The glucose concentration of the muscle lysate was measured using a commercially available kit (Glucose Wako C-II kit; Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corp., Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan). The muscle glycogen content (mM) was calculated using the dilution factor of each lysate.  Muscle force measurement The muscle performance was measured by ex-vivo muscle contraction experimentation. After the removal of extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle (tendon to tendon), the muscle was transferred into a Krebs–Henseleit solution (117 mM NaCl, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 24.8 mM NaHCO3, 11.1 mM glucose, 25 μM D-tubocurarine chloride).

After a 10 min equilibration period, the optimal extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle length was found using a micrometer. The maximal voltage evoking a single twitch was also found using electrical field stimulation (SEN-3301; Nihon Kohden Corp.). Once the experimental condition was fixed, a twitch was evoked (1 Hz, 1 ms for the duration). After a 5 min resting period, tetanic contraction was evoked by field stimulation of 90 Hz, 300 ms for the duration with supramaximal stimulation voltage (1.5 fold voltage evoking the twitch). Each tetanic contraction was performed sequentially but separated by a 3 min recovery period. Muscle fatigue was measured in another subset of animals.",fc4a19fb-6aac-4b8b-93f2-be9d92026006
13,methods13," The extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle was prepared as described above: tetanic contraction was evoked at 60 Hz for 300 ms duration at 3 s intervals for 10 min. Data were recorded every minute.  The muscle force was amplified using a carrier amplifier (AP-621G; Nihon Kohden Corp.). Data were stored digitally in a computer via an A/D converter (USB-6008; National Instruments Japan Corp., Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan) controlled by software (LabVIEW; National Instruments Japan Corp.). Muscle force was normalized by the total muscle cross-sectional area to ascertain the specific tension.

23,discussion0,"This study was conducted to clarify ketogenic diet effects on skeletal muscle contractile function and biochemical characteristics in rats. Results indicate that four weeks of ketogenic diet feeding prevented increase in body mass with age, as demonstrated by earlier studies [2, 6, 23–26, 47, 48]. Results show that ketogenic diet feeding did not change muscle force production or fatigue resistance in isolated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. Importantly, the ketogenic diet induced MyHC shift from type IIb to IIx. Moreover, this shift was accompanied by improved enzyme expression and activity for mitochondrial and fatty acid metabolism. Although the findings are limited to those for fast-twitch muscles, these results suggest that the ketogenic diet improves muscle aerobic energy metabolism without compromising muscle performance. Results also demonstrate that Sema3A might mediate MyHC shift in extensor digitorum longus (EDL).",0c7a9432-bebb-4220-80f5-38bbab901900
24,discussion1,"  Results show that the ketogenic diet increased CS activity and CS and COX-IV protein expression in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle: CS is an important enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle in mitochondria; COX-IV is a mitochondrial enzyme that mediates the respiratory chain reaction. The respective expressions of these enzymes are indicators of mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle [32]. Consequently, our results suggest that a ketogenic diet improves oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle. However, these findings contradict those of studies that have shown lowered mitochondria function [5, 21] and decreased CS activity [21] by a ketogenic diet. In this regard, Parker et al. reported recently that a ketogenic diet followed for four weeks decreased CS activity in the red portion, but not in the white portion of gastrocnemius muscles in rats [25].",66f3ab7f-9f99-4e0b-bdd4-85a3acb0ff44
25,discussion2," This finding suggests that mitochondrial enzyme adaptation to ketogenic diet depends on the muscle fiber type. In addition, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle has different proportions of muscle fiber types from those of gastrocnemius muscle [42, 49] used in earlier studies [5, 21, 25]. Although our results indicate a positive role of ketogenic diet on mitochondria, a study examining muscle fiber types must be conducted to ascertain ketogenic diet effects on those enzymes in skeletal muscle.  Results obtained for muscle glycogen, an important energy source in a fast-twitch muscle such as extensor digitorum longus (EDL), indicate no change in glycogen content after four weeks of ketogenic diet feeding. By contrast, Shimizu et al. reported that four weeks of ketogenic diet decreased muscle glycogen content in mice [22]. One difference between the results reported herein and those reported by Shimizu et al. [22] is adaptation of the fat oxidation enzyme. Although Shimizu et al.",90c7618a-dda6-463a-998a-bf8a4b40ccab
26,discussion3," found no change in HAD gene expression [22], results of this study show that the ketogenic diet increased HAD protein expression, suggesting improved fat oxidation capacity of KD animals. Efficient fat utilization capacity is helpful to store muscle glycogen content. Indeed, keto-adapted skeletal muscle showed enhanced fat oxidation capacity, but comparable muscle glycogen content to that of the high-carbohydrate diet condition in humans [50]. Therefore, we speculate that improved fat oxidation capacity engenders reserve muscle glycogen content in our KD animals. Regarding glycogen usage, results show that the ketogenic diet did not change the expression of PFK, a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. Increased energy demand from glycolysis reportedly improves PFK activity in skeletal muscle [29, 42, 51].",a46085eb-53c4-4262-8a93-ac4216ac02c1
27,discussion4," Consequently, our results suggest that the energy demand of glycolysis in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle during the four-week ketogenic diet is similar to that obtained from the control diet.  The skeletal muscle fiber type is determined by the MyHC isoform. An important finding of this study is that the four-week ketogenic diet induced a fast-to-slow shift among type II MyHC isoforms in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. Slower type II fiber is generally accepted as showing higher aerobic metabolic capacity than faster type II fibers [49, 52]. Moreover, exercise training-induced increase in type IIa and IIx isoforms and decrease in type IIb isoform are associated with improved muscle aerobic capacity [31, 42, 53]. Therefore, our results indicate that ketogenic diet improves muscle aerobic capacity in the view of muscle fiber type transformation.",89cae1e5-2bc1-483e-9ab6-369baa86f264
28,discussion5," Although the finding remains controversial, a ketogenic diet reportedly ameliorates hyperglycemia in a diabetic rat model [13, 54]. A recent study using single fiber analysis revealed that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was higher in order of type I and IIa, IIx, and IIb fibers in rats [55]. Consequently, our results indicate that such a favorable effect on blood glucose regulation by ketogenic diet [13, 54] might be associated partially with the fast-to-slow type II fiber shift in skeletal muscle.  In skeletal muscles, PGC-1α [5, 34–36], peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α [36, 37], and Mef2C [34, 38–40] are representative molecules regulating muscle oxidative metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and fast-to-slow muscle fiber type shift. Nevertheless, the ketogenic diet did not change the expression of those factors in this study, suggesting that these factors are not associated with results obtained from the current study.",1d50acdf-f87f-48b8-ab94-ebbe8e534ed8
29,discussion6," Regarding the search for potential factors, a recent study drew our attention to the muscle fiber type shift by Sema3A. Tatsumi et al. reported increased gene expression of MyHC IIb, but that of slow MyHC was decreased in Sema3A-inhibited myotubes [41]. Moreover, the authors examined muscle regeneration in muscle satellite cell-specific Sema3A knockout mice. After 28 days of cardiotoxin injection, they found that the regenerated muscle exhibited a dramatic increase in type IIb fiber and lower numbers of type I, IIa, and IIx fibers [41]. These findings suggest Sema3A as a negative regulator of type IIb fibers, but as a positive regulator of type I, IIa, and IIx fibers. In light of these findings, we presume that ketogenic diet at least induces muscle phenotype change to more oxidative fiber by enhancing Sema3A in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) because the ketogenic diet increased Sema3A expression in the present study.",8385fee3-27ec-46f1-864b-3c661e34ce19
30,discussion7," Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether Sema3A can modify the expression of mitochondrial and fat oxidation enzymes or mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle.  Clarifying the precise mechanisms of ketogenic-induced improvements of aerobic metabolism is beyond the scope of this study. Although no change was found in PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α, and Mef2C in our results, different factors are expected to be associated with those improvements. For example, an earlier study revealed that retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor α signaling can regulate CS expression in Hepg2 cells [56]. Moreover, COX-IV expression has been found to be regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 in different mammalian cell types [57]. Furthermore, HAD gene expression was increased in fast-twitch tibialis anterior muscles of leptin receptor disrupted rats, suggesting that leptin negatively regulates HAD expression in skeletal muscle [58].",953c2d47-9dba-4e11-8cef-e9f5ea431de5
31,discussion8," Importantly, the influences of ketogenic diet on those regulatory systems remain completely unknown at present. Further research must be conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of ketogenic diet-induced improvement of aerobic metabolism.  Despite the improvement of aerobic capacity, the ketogenic diet did not enhance extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle fatigue resistance in this study. Although the reason for this inconsistency cannot be explained, we speculate that a change occurred in the relation between mitochondrial content and function. Mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity are normally correlated. Moreover, increased mitochondrial content and function is important for muscle endurance [59]. However, a recent report of the relevant literature has described mitochondrial respiration as impaired even though the mitochondrial content was increased by a high-fat diet in the red gastrocnemius muscle [60].",023632ab-5e74-4534-865a-3117de2897f7
32,discussion9," Although no ketogenic diet was involved, the results [60] suggest that a higher fat diet disrupts the proportional relation between the volume and the function of mitochondria. Consequently, ketogenic diet-induced improvement of aerobic metabolism might not contribute directly to muscle endurance in our KD animals. Another route of speculation is the experimental conditions under which muscle performance measurements were taken. This study used a standard Krebs–Henseleit solution for an environment of electrical stimulation [45, 46]. However, our KD animals were found to have greater concentrations of circulating ketone bodies, which can be an additional energy source. Moreover, our KD animals showed biochemical adaptation to the ketogenic diet environment. Accordingly, we might observe a change in muscle performance if the experimental solution includes a practical amount of ketone body.",444c68c7-3331-428a-96a4-3cb928cfa78a
33,discussion10,"  Results of earlier studies also show that the ketogenic diet did not impair the twitch or tetanic force. Although no study using isolated muscle has been conducted, a few studies have examined the relation between the ketogenic diet and muscle strength in vivo. Beckett et al. reported that a ketogenic diet fed for four weeks did not affect muscle grip strength in male mice [26]. This trend was also reported for aged mice (12 months of age) consuming a ketogenic diet for a month [6]. The grip strength measurement is used to estimate the maximum limb strength. Therefore, our results support those studies at the isolated organ level. Taken together, our results indicate that a four-week ketogenic diet had no adverse effect on extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle performance.  Finally, the results of this study indicate that the ketogenic diet did not change the muscle mass. The ketogenic diet decreased the body mass gain. Therefore, the relative muscle mass was higher in KD animals.",9c4a6b4c-8174-4997-8dc9-7a019a46cd15
34,discussion11," This finding is consistent with earlier reports describing four-week ketogenic diet feeding [6, 24, 25]. Consequently, application of a ketogenic diet for four weeks is not harmful to muscle quantity.  In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that a four-week ketogenic diet alters skeletal muscle toward aerobic energy phenotype without obstructing muscle contractile performance in sedentary male rats. Sema3A might partially mediate the phenotypic change. Regarded in perspective, our findings suggest ergogenic benefits of a ketogenic diet for people, such as athletes, who must reconcile body weight loss and muscle performance.
