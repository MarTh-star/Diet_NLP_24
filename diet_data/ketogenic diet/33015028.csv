0,methods0," 2.1. Subjects, and Anthropometric and Biochemical Measurements  Thirty male subjects, affected by obesity and aged between 50 and 60 years (±8 years), were enrolled by the Laboratory of Physiology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Foggia. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee 22 May 2018, n◦440/DS, and conducted according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.  The sample chosen was completely male because, given the age range of our population (50–60 years), we preferred to consider only a male population to minimize hormonal interference due to menopause, which could have affected a group of women of the same age.",4e75d798-5473-47d5-ba5f-ce0fade964de
1,methods1," In our population, we evaluated body composition by measuring height, weight, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), and visceral adipose tissue (visceral adipose tissue (VAT)) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DEXA)). Serum samples were collected after a 12-h overnight fasting period. Serum aliquots were stored at −80 °C. As previously reported, for all participants, glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)), high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)), triglycerides, LDH, aspartate transaminase (aspartate transaminase (AST)), alanine transaminase (alanine transaminase (ALT)), IL-10, TNF-a, adiponectin, and Orexin-A were measured [21,22].  2.2. Study Protocol  All participants underwent a general medical examination [9]. To verify if the patients followed the diet correctly, every day ketone was measured in capillary blood (GD40 Delta test strips, TaiDoc Technology Co.",c4ee7f1a-f894-4445-847f-6f1e2f24b6f4
2,methods2,"; New Taipei City, Taiwan). The levels b-hydroxybutyrate >0.5 mmol/L determined the nutritional ketosis. Fasting (12 h) blood samples were collected at 8:00 a.m. [21,22].  2.3. Diet Protocol  Obese subjects followed a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD), as per an advertised weight loss program (Lignaform, Therascience), consisting of <50 g/d sugar from vegetables, 43% fat, 43% protein, 14% carbohydrates, and 700–900 kcal. The amount of protein ranged between 1.0 and 1.2 g per kilo of ideal weight. Although, the dietary intervention profile consisted of three totally different stages, for the needs of this study, only active ketogenic phases of the primary stage were considered. This stage had an 8-week length, to permit participants to realize some of their weight loss target. In this period, vitamins, minerals, and polyunsaturated fatty acid were provided in accordance with international recommendations.  2.4.",6db79313-56c3-424d-a540-b8dc3137c81f
3,methods3," Hormonal Secretion Assay  Salivary samples were collected between 09:00 and 11:00 before the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) intervention and after eight weeks of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) intervention using of cotton swabs (Salivette, Sarstedt, Rommelsdorf, Germany). Participants were asked to position the cotton swab in their mouth for a minimum of two minutes and then insert it into a special plastic tube. Samples were sent as soon as possible to the laboratory and kept at −20 °C until the corticoid assay. The secretion samples were centrifuged at 1500× g for 15 min at 4 °C. To gauge the absence of blood contamination, a secretion blood contamination kit was used (Salimetrics LLC, State faculty, PA, USA). Corticoid concentrations were measured using commercial kits (Salimetrics LLC, State faculty, La Place Court, Carlsbad, CA, USA), as per the manufacturers’ directions. All samples were tested in triplicate and analyzed in duplicate.  2.5.",16b353f3-f418-47dd-a8b1-7e6e4f305a0a
4,methods4," Galvanic Skin Response  Within five minutes following spittle collection, electrodermal response information was recorded. The electrodermal response parameters were measured with a SenseWear professional Armband™ (version 3.0, BodyMedia, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), which was worn on the appropriate arm over the striated muscle at the center between the appendage and olecranon process, as suggested by the manufacturer [5].  2.6. Applied Mathematics Analysis  We performed applied mathematical analyses using StatView software 5.0.1.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). All information is given as means ± SE; a two-tailed paired t test was used to check for applied mathematical significance of the outcome variables. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was used for statistical significance.

5,methods5," Anthropometric and Biochemical Characteristics of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) Obese Patients  In the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) patients after diet intervention, there was a large change in anthropometric and biochemical parameters. Many parameters such as weight and body mass index (BMI) were statistically reduced in Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) obese subjects after the diet. Furthermore, t-test analysis showed that glycemic, lipid profile, and inflammatory status were strongly ameliorated in these subjects after the diet. In Table 1 we report the results, with a p-value < 0.05.  3.2. Physiological Responses to Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)  The Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) induced a significant decrease in both autonomic and hormonal variables. The analysis of variance showed significant differences between the experimental conditions for galvanic skin response (GSR) (4.2 μS vs. 2.11 μS, p < 0.05) and cortisol (1.31 μmol/L vs.",a7c5681f-c14c-4591-aa65-3b9dd14dfa1a
6,methods6," 1.01 μmol/L p < 0.01). Salivary cortisol levels in the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) obese patients were strongly decreased after the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) intervention (Figure 1). In Figure 2 reports the galvanic skin response (GSR) modulation. Interestingly, using Pearson’s test correlation, we observed correlations between salivary cortisol, biochemical, and anthropometric parameters in the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) obese subjects. Salivary cortisol negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and total cholesterol and positively correlated with adiponectin serum levels, expressed as μ variation in Figure 3A–C.  4. Discussion  In obesity, there are several aspects to contemplate such as secretion and metabolic processes, as well as aerophilous stress, inferior chronic inflammation, and hormone resistance [23]. It is fascinating to note that secretion alterations play a vital role within the development of obesity.",aaaaa282-555c-436d-8704-8677fda06b70
7,methods7,"  In addition, many studies on obesity have shown alterations in corticosteroid metabolism and in its secretion and action [24]. In our study, we investigated the consequences of a calorie restriction program for weight loss on the sympathetic system and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (HPA)) through the analysis of the secretion of corticosteroid and reaction levels.  We found a distinct reduction in corticosteroid concentrations within the saliva of the obese subjects with Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) intervention. Several pieces of information within the literature suggest that the deregulation of the neural structure of the adrenal–pituitary axis contributes to its disorder, increasing the secretion of corticosteroid, which may be a risk factor for numerous metabolic disorders [25].",f082b9a0-db96-4c52-8c47-77be58b67edb
8,methods8," Corticosteroid is a vital regulator of endocrine operation, metabolism, and differentiation of adipocytes, as well as a contributor to adipogenesis and increased visceral fat reserves [26]. In addition, this hormone plays a major role within the hormone signaling pathways, because it alters the hormone sensitivity in several tissues, thereby reducing aldohexose uptake and contributing to hormone resistance [27]. Corticosteroid metabolism is regulated by two groups of enzymes, 11βdehydrogenase [9]. Increased expression of the protein is related to the pathological process of central obesity, metabolic syndrome, and the dysregulation of aldohexose and lipoid metabolism [9].",6cac9a96-068a-4e3c-a83e-1e758ec8bfd4
9,methods9," Studies have shown an association between increased expression and activity of this protein in visceral white animal tissue and reduced plasma concentrations of adiponectin, which might indirectly contribute to increased production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (as in [3,28,29,30,31,32]), supporting of the correlation of statistics that we tend to find between corticosteroid and adiponectin. The role of glucocorticoids in the regulation of animal tissue operation is very advanced. These substances result in the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, similarly to fat tissue lipolysis under certain conditions [33,34,35]. Chronic exposure to glucocorticoids favors the enlargement of animal tissue, which compromises the action of the hormone, leading to symptoms and dyslipidemia.  In a lean state, the corticosteroid is lower, and its production will increase in response to stress, as well as diet interventions. In an obese condition this is totally different.",7821fbb1-8786-46c3-a304-4d4e6422cfb8
10,methods10," In fact, the consequences of stress on weight gain manifest in several ways because of the various properties of glucocorticoids. High levels of a corticosteroid will, for example, increase appetite, with a preference for “comforting food”, and cause the distribution of white animal tissue within the abdominal region, which might eventually result in abdominal weight gain [14]. Curiously, it has been determined that glucocorticoids will scale back the sensitivity of the adrenergic stimulation of brown fat [14]. Additionally, the administration of exogenous glucocorticoids will increase the intrahepatic conversion of ketosteroids to corticosteroids; therefore, undoubtedly contributing to the vicious circle [15,36]. This relationship between chronic stress-associated weight mediate by an increased action of glucocorticoids could also be bigger in some folks because of exposure to factors that improve stress response.",fce793b4-9d2b-4267-90dd-7cb7f6be5fd3
11,methods11," Biological factors, like the transport of glucocorticoid-sensitive GR factor variants, or a diurnal cortico-steroid rhythm interrupted by shrunken sleep and/or shift work, will doubtless result in bigger effects of glucocorticoids and therefore build some folks a lot of liable to weight gain and obesity [36,37]. On the opposite hand, obesity itself also can result in a rise in chronic stress a variable degree, depending on certain individual characteristics. People that experience, for example, weight stigma are identified not only as experiencing a lot of stress, but additionally to have higher semi-permanent corticosteroid levels [14,36,37]. Additionally, obese patients are a lot more likely to suffer from mental and physical disorders that successively will result in chronic stress and/or higher corticosteroid levels [23,38].",82f4db13-6ebc-4ef4-96e6-40e9c34f09ac
12,methods12," This might even be ex-aggregated by using certain medications indicated for comorbidities associated with obesity, such as corticosteroids for arthritis or respiratory illness. Additionally, the same applies to alternative environmental and activity factors, such as the intake of foods with a high glycemic index, excessive use of alcohol, and chronic pain, which might itself result in a rise in corticosteroid levels and a rise in weight [14].  In this scenario, a diet reducing carbohydrates, such as the Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) can reduce cortisol levels and have many beneficial effects, not only on weight loss but also for re-modulating metabolic, hormonal, and psychological aspects [21,22,24].  In addition, the treatment of obesity with very-low-calorie diets causes a decrease in serum cortisol, explained by the decrease in cortisol-binding proteins.",380af26b-5397-4ffd-a730-678027a56233
13,methods13," The increased cortisol secretion observed in patients with abdominal obesity can contribute to metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension) [24]. In addition, the role of stress in obesity is also reported in this study. Several studies have shown that the high responsiveness of cortisol to stress is related to increased food intake in healthy-weight individuals [38].  Our data provide further support for a possible effect of cortisol reactivity on food intake in people with obesity, but not in healthy weight controls. Therefore, the physiological mechanism of stress-induced nutrition is a complex interaction between many different hormones, whose secretion and activity are affected by glucocorticoids [3,38,39,40,41].",ff47a531-d986-4eed-9117-f2077d200ed5
14,methods14,"  In addition, we also found a reduction in galvanic skin response (GSR), which confirms the role of stress and the reactivity of cortisol in food intake, confirming the association between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis [3,38,39].  5. Conclusions  A Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) has a short-term positive effect on the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (HPA) axes. In addition, there is a strong relation between obesity and stress, and cortisol has a key role. For these reasons, Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) has an important role reducing stress and regulating salivary cortisol levels. Finally, the effects of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) on the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis may lead to more individualized treatment strategies that integrate obesity and stress in support of the reduction of the individual disease burden.",bac0647d-95b2-4752-8912-1186c57745ea
15,methods15,"  Limitation of the study: this is one of the first studies investigating Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) effects on the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis; however, a limitation to this study is the small number of male patients considered. For this reason, it is our intention to expand the series to include the female population in further studies on this subject.
