The treatment protocol with total duration of 45 days, was formulated according to the criteria of ketogenic diet (KD), using a modified ketogenic diet protocol defined here as “mixed ketogenic”. The “mixed ketogenic” diet included a daily protein intake, in part, isolated whey protein powder derived from milk with a high biological value and complete amino acid composition profile with near zero carbohydrates and fat content, and partly from animal protein sources such as meat, fish, or eggs (Table 1). The formulation of the diet aimed to the establish ketosis, preserving the lean mass through the protein quota without being a high-protein diet. For this purpose, a protein intake of 1.1–1.2 g/kg/die ideal body weight was used.",92ab4945-d221-4077-ae32-247af2f81878

The total daily caloric intake was established at around 600 kcal; thus, the diet was a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet, this induced a drastic reduction of calories aimed at obtaining weight loss mainly from the fat mass. The lipid component was set to 30 g/day, mainly consumed in the form of extra virgin olive oil in the amount of 10 g taken during the evening meal, to which the lipid quotas contained in meat and fish and in oil-dried nuts and oilseeds were added. Breakfast and lunch consisted of the above protein powder (isolated whey protein).

The protocol did not permit the use of food supplements and herbal extracts. The two-course dinner menu consisted of meat or fish, that the patient was able to choose daily, provided that fish was consumed at least three times a week. The portions of meat or fish were assigned based on individual protein requirements and body composition. The second course was based on vegetables.

Moreover, as mentioned above, 10 g of extra virgin olive oil was added to the dinner. Meat (or fish) was only replaced twice a week with eggs, in variable portions based on individual protein needs. Moreover, patients were asked to consume no less than 2 L of water/day. The exact bromatological composition of the diet was calibrated from subject to subject, where proteins represented on average 35–40% of daily calories, according to individual needs and body composition.

15,methods19," Discussion  Polycystic ovary syndrome (Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of childbearing age. In Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) an excess of androgens is often associated with metabolic disorders such as central obesity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. Insulin resistance has recently been proposed as the primary disorder from which other endocrine and reproductive anomalies of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) would arise, such as hyperandrogenism [20,21,22,23,24]. To date, there are no corrective treatments, although the use of some drugs can improve some clinical and biochemical parameters. The guidelines recommend a lifestyle change through diet and exercise as a first-line intervention in the management of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [20].",9a4fcbfd-c11d-4bc8-9379-838659f0008a
16,methods20," The most accepted weight loss strategy is based on a simple reduction in daily calorie intake as part of a low fat/high carbohydrate diet, but there is still no clear data on which dietary protocols are most active, in the short and long term or even on what is the correct nutritional approach in general. Any therapy aimed at resolving or improving insulin resistance can undoubtedly guarantee an improvement not only from the metabolic point of view but also from the endocrinological point of view, being the two aspects most strongly interconnected [25]. In the last decade, interest in the ketogenic diet as nutritional treatment has increased as it is able to guarantee significant weight loss and to bring the countless benefits that derive from it, especially in insulin resistance conditions [26]. Our results showed that the KD has numerous beneficial effects in women affected by Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a short period of 6 weeks (45 days).",cbd241f8-9315-4561-85be-0e9c2066d4ff
17,methods21," There was a strong amelioration of biochemical and anthropometric parameters such as weight loss, body mass index (BMI), FM, glycemia, sex hormone binding globulins (SHBG) serum levels, and Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA). Furthermore, these parameters also correlate with endocrinological hormones such as LH, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).  The overproduction of LH with inversion of the LH/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio in favor of LH and the simultaneous decrease in the production of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) mediated by the action of inhibin, is the basis of follicular maturation failure, anovulatory and the hyperstimulation of thecal cells by LH.",a825bac1-c833-4508-b6f5-85a0782bb4a2
18,methods22," As a consequence, we have an androgenic hypersecretion and the establishment of a self-fed vicious circle, to which insulin and IGF contribute, the latter locally produced in excess and enhanced by the often-coexisting condition of obesity, exerting a synergistic effect with LH in stimulating the synthesis of androgens with an increase in their circulation [27,28,29,30,31]. It should be remembered that hyperandrogenism is not in itself a cause of hyperinsulinemia, while the reverse is true. These hormonal changes are almost always associated with insulin resistance and consequent hyperinsulinism, of an important degree in about 1/3 of the patients, influenced by environmental factors, such as, first and foremost, obesity that is present in about half of the subjects with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [1,2,3].",54ff1f59-5959-45b5-89dd-9db89f26aa8c
19,methods23," In fact, a reduced glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus are the long-term sequelae of insulin resistance, especially in the presence of familiarity for type 2 diabetes mellitus, which has been observed in 45% of patients over 40 years old. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is approximately double in women with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) than in the general population of the same age and body mass index (BMI) [12]. Given this pathophysiological characteristic, our dietary medical intervention, based on the administration of a mixed ketogenic diet during Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and considering the results obtained, can be a dietetic approach that may lead to a reversal of these processes.",26933174-a84d-4dcb-a367-29d4cc495c97
20,methods24," The results attest that the mixed dietary ketogenic medical intervention, by reducing the amount of carbohydrates and inducing therapeutic ketosis, acts favorably and effectively in the management of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), in agreement with the study reported by Paoli et al., 2020, but in contrast with us, the authors reported a normo-caloric diet with the addition of phytocomplexes acting also on catecholaminergic system. In our study is reported the positive outcome of very low-calorie ketogenic diet in a short period and based on caloric restriction and its therapeutic ketosis related [32].",18768105-ddac-4c32-9107-3e3ce0a6eef5
21,methods25," Furthermore, with the mixed ketogenic intervention, a reduction in blood glucose levels, insulinemia and an improvement in insulin sensitivity were obtained, which consequently led to a reduction in androgen production, whereas the contextual reduction of fat mass reduced the acyclic production of estrogens deriving from the aromatization in the adipose tissue of the androgen excess, with an improvement of the LH/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio. This last ratio improves through the reduction of the excess of LH thanks to a relative increase in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). No less important is that the mixed ketogenic diet resulted in an increase in albumin and sex hormone binding globulins (SHBG), both free testosterone binding proteins, with a consequent reduction in bioactive free testosterone, thus contributing to a further improvement of hyperandrogenism.",a216934a-c15d-436f-b280-492fbd39abe7
22,methods26," These data are very interesting and showed that this pathology is a multifactorial disease influenced by lifestyle. Indeed, as reported by Giampaolino et al., 2021, Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is influenced by the gut microbiota and then by nutrition [33]. In addition, a recent study reported the role of probiotics as modifiers of the gut microbiota in women affected by Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and then their potential role as drugs in Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) treatment. These data suggested the important role of nutrition on the gut microbiota, on Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) establishment and on their mutual relationship [34]. Furthermore, as showed by many data in the literature, non-diabetic women with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and with associated insulin resistance showed lower levels of sex hormone binding globulins (SHBG).",2635aed1-9fd5-4b98-82a8-9d34ca0256e9
23,methods27," Numerous studies have examined the relationships between sex hormone binding globulins (SHBG) and T2DM polymorphisms, suggesting that sex hormone binding globulins (SHBG) may represent a candidate gene for Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [35,36,37,38,39,40]. Moreover, the most interesting data are represented by the clinical outcome deriving from mixed ketogenic medical diet therapy: in fact, on the total number of women enrolled five patients had a natural reappearance of the menstrual cycle after amenorrhea, 12 patients benefited from the regularization of the cycle and five of these 12 patients achieved pregnancy after numerous previous unproductive attempts [41,42,43].",79167a09-c386-4652-9845-23c6e20a42f1
24,methods28,"  Therefore, mixed ketogenic medical diet therapy for only 45 days, intervening electively and specifically on some of the key pathophysiological moments that determine Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), such as insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperandrogenism, the increase in LH and the inversion of the LH/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio, represents an adjuvant metabolic therapy in the management of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), completely free of the adverse effects of the currently used drug therapies, with the added value of reducing the risk of developing obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetic disease. No less important is the significant increase in terms of pregnancies achieved and regularization of the menstrual cycle [44]. Many data in the literature support our results, as reported by Gupta et al.",f8a52dc0-d2fe-42c2-a772-89d5d37a871e
25,methods29,", the metabolic and endocrine effects of a low carbohydrate KD are evidenced by improvements in body weight, free testosterone percentage, luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio, and fasting insulin levels [15,16,17,43]. This leads to a decrease in androgen secretion and an increase in sex-hormone binding globulin, improving insulin sensitivity, and thereby normalizing endocrine functions. Such a dietary intervention and lifestyle management has beneficial effects in the treatment of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients affected with obesity and type 2 diabetes [45,46,47]. It has also been shown to improve depressive symptoms, psychological disturbances, and health-related quality of life in these patients [44,48,49,50].  5. Conclusions  The ketogenic diet has a positive effect on Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) outcome. The positive effects obtained in a very short period represent a point of strength of our study.",7cb27db1-4202-47ee-aad3-8ce5075e366b
26,methods30," In addition, ketogenic diet is able to induce therapeutic ketonemia basing on caloric restriction, using only food. In this dietary protocol only calorie restriction is used and not the aid of functional foods that can induce weight loss. The use of caloric restriction in a short period represents a strong point of this ketogenic diet protocol able of inducing improvements in the outcome of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This diet intervention can improve the anthropometric and metabolic profile of these subjects. The ketogenic diet and its beneficial effects may be used as an adjuvant to pharmacological therapy for Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), in addition, in the first stage of this disease, the ketogenic diet may be useful as a non-pharmacological therapy, however, further studies are needed to clarify the molecular mechanism of the beneficial effects of the ketogenic diet.
