0,methods0," Study Design: Isocaloric Ketogenic Diet in Healthy Subjects  This study was carried out at Severance Hospital. Eligible participants were healthy adults (19-44 years of age) with a BMI of at least 18 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria included: any disease including diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; any current medication; or pregnant women. We recruited 15 healthy volunteers aged 24-38 years of age (7 men and 8 women) and placed them on an isocaloric KD restricting intake of carbohydrates but not energy (75% fat, 20% protein, 5% carbohydrate) for 3 days ( Figure 1 ). Total energy (calories)/day were determined by the ‘Dietary Reference Intakes for Koreans’ (20): men, 10.88 MJ (2,600 kcal)/day for age under 30 and 10 MJ (2,400 kcal)/day for age 30 or older; women, 8.79 MJ (2,100 kcal)/day for age under 30 and 7.95 MJ (1,900 kcal)/day for age 30 or older.

To stimulate the release of IL-1β, 2 mM adenosine triphosphate (adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) (Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.2 mM palmitate (Sigma-Aldrich, P9767) was added for the last 1 or 12 hours of incubation, respectively. In addition, to evaluate the direct inhibitory or stimulating effects on NLRP3 inflammasome activation, BHB (1 mM), FGF21 (15, 30 or 100 nM), or bafilomycin (10 nM) were pre-treated for 5 hours before adding Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Supernatants were collected, centrifuged to remove cells and debris, and stored at -80°C for later analysis.

8,results0," Short-Term Isocaloric Ketogenic Diet Changes Metabolic Parameters  After a short-term KD, fasting serum BHB concentration was significantly elevated (median [interquartile range]: 0.03 [0.02 - 0.06] to 0.49 [0.36 - 1.25] mM, P <0.0001) ( Figure 2A ). These results accompanied decrease in fasting serum insulin levels (7.00 ± 3.87 to 4.61 ± 3.54 µU/mL, P < 0.01) ( Figure 2B ). Interestingly, the isocaloric KD produced no change in fasting serum glucose levels ( Figures 2C ).

12,results4,"  Short-Term Isocaloric Ketogenic Diet Suppresses Inflammasome Activation Mediated by FGF21  To investigate whether FGF21 mediates the KD effect on ameliorating inflammasome activation, we measured serum FGF21 levels and found it increased after KD (mean ± standard error of the mean, 108.25 ± 34.1 to 167.28 ± 28.47 pg/mL, P <0.01) ( Figure 4A ). To further assess the direct effect of FGF21 on human macrophages, we treated FGF21 prior to assessing inflammasome activation with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). IL-1β secretion was significantly reduced in a dose dependent manner ( Figure 4B ). Both FGF21and BHB further reduced IL-1β secretion levels compared to either BHB or FGF21 alone ( Figure 4C ). In addition, FGF21 is known to augment autophagy in islets (27).",736921b8-66d2-4d83-8c34-57a034348f69

15,discussion0," In this short-term isocaloric KD study, we showed that insulin sensitivity improved with low serum insulin levels, although there was no difference in blood glucose levels. The regimen reduced body weight and increased mobilization of body fat in healthy subjects. High BHB and low IL-1β levels were observed after isocaloric KD. Reduced IL-1β levels were also detected along with increased FGF21 levels in serum. In a test of the direct effect of FGF21 on macrophages, FGF21 was seen to reduce macrophage IL-1β secretion, and its inhibitory effect was blunted by an autophagy inhibitor ( Figure 5 ).  Figure 5 The summary of effects of the isocaloric ketogenic diet.  It is important to note that there were no changes in glucose levels but insulin levels were low, suggesting that KD improved insulin sensitivity in a short period of time. BHB is involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis.",6a949a6c-7ee8-4b11-b4f4-ed1eb27da476
16,discussion1," After 21 days of KD in diabetes patients, glucose and insulin levels significantly were reduced with high BHB levels in serum (28). A very low carbohydrate diet for 8 weeks in men and women with obesity improved HOMA-IR (29).  A recognized effect of KD is reduction in body weight (30, 31), which may explain most of its metabolic benefits. However, most studies were of long duration and investigated prolonged impact, making it difficult to differentiate between KD per se and weight reducing effect. We demonstrated that, even in a short period of time without reducing calorie intake or a large decrement in body weight, isocaloric KD can mobilize fat and change inflammasome activity in immune cells, a potential advantage for improving metabolic regulation (32).  Previously, Vandanmagsar et al. reported that NLRP3 and IL-1β are associated with insulin resistance in mice with obesity (33). In that study, insulin sensitivity improved in mice that were NLRP3 deficient.",9ec5eb31-bc83-4ea3-9981-55134591f4a1
17,discussion2," BHB deactivates NLRP3 and resolves inflammatory diseases (14, 15). In our study, inflammasome activation was significantly suppressed in adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human macrophages with isocaloric KD as well as with direct treatment of BHB. In line with these findings, we have previously reported that SGLT2 inhibitor, a glucose lowering drug, regulates NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages by increasing serum BHB levels and lowering insulin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (23).  Along with the high levels of BHB after isocaloric KD, we also detected an increase in serum FGF21. FGF21 is a hormone widely expressed in multiple organs. It was first identified in the liver (34, 35). Hepatic FGF21 mRNA expression levels were induced in mice that were fed a KD for 30 days (36). Serum FGF21 levels increased up to four-fold with prolonged fasting in healthy subjects (25, 37).",e8943463-c931-4d67-beab-464905d8eb37
18,discussion3," Exogenous FGF21 has been shown to reduce body weight gain and fat content in diet-induced obese (diet induced obese (DIO)) or ob/ob genetically obese mouse models. Insulin levels were significantly reduced with FGF21 treatment in a dose dependent manner in the diet induced obese (DIO) mouse model, indicating an improvement in insulin sensitivity (38). In addition, FGF21 controls triglyceride levels in rodents (39) and in humans (40).  In type 2 diabetes mellitus, NLRP-IL-1β Inflammasome is a key factor in the development of insulin resistance (41). Since FGF21 agonists suppress the inflammasome after reduction of sequential inflammatory processes (42, 43), reduced serum IL-1β levels may be affected by not only BHB activity but also by FGF21 activity. Among human FGF21 receptors, FGF21 receptor 1 and β-klotho are expressed in multiple tissues, including PBMCs (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000134962-KLB/blood, https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000077782-FGFR1/blood).",7fd484b1-e5a1-4641-b561-497c25c67e68
19,discussion4," After direct treatment of FGF21 on human macrophages, we observed reduced cytokine secretion related to the inflammasome. When patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus lose body weight, FGF21 levels also decrease (44). This may be due to improvement in FGF21 signaling sensitivity similar to the effect on insulin resistance, which is ameliorated by loss of body weight. Taken together, our findings suggest that isocaloric KD not only increases FGF21 levels but also improves FGF21 signaling pathways thereby lowering inflammatory activation.  Consistent with these findings, a recent study reported that serum FGF21 levels can predict NAFLD improvement in patients with a very low caloric KD (32); fatty liver is also improved with increased tissue FGF21 mRNA expression levels in intermittent KD [abstract: diabetes 2020 Jun; 69 (Supplement 1):1957-P]. FGF21 is also known to reduce hepatic glucose production (45); however, we did not observe any changes in glucose levels.",34d667ca-0bc0-45b8-b395-d6686aa79d83
20,discussion5," This may possibly be due to the acute response levels of FGF21 to the isocaloric KD regimen. FGF21 global knockout mice on a KD had opposite phenotypes, such as body weight gain, insulin resistance, and inflammatory state. In addition to the role of FGF21 in glucose and insulin regulation, it has a significant impact on fat mobilization and oxidation (46, 47). In our study, 3 days of isocaloric KD was sufficient to induce an increase in FGF21 levels and a change in FGF21 and other biochemical profiles [free fatty acid (FFA) levels in healthy subjects. In mice, a 24-hour fasting period was sufficient to increase FGF21 levels (36, 48). Increased FGF21 levels with a KD also mimics the effects of exercise (49). Therefore, our study suggests that isocaloric KD has positive effects in healthy subjects, even in the short term.  Multiple studies have explained that FGF21 augments and exerts its effects through autophagy.",f4b83c16-9bfd-42a1-a93d-1dbafc3f3ace
21,discussion6," For example, fasting induced exogenous FGF21 significantly improved obese phenotypes of mice with increased autophagy-related proteins and autophagosomes (27, 50–52). However, the role of autophagy in isocaloric KD, especially in macrophages of healthy individuals, has not been thoroughly studied. The current study showed that the suppressive effect of FGF21 on inflammasome activation in human macrophages was at least partially mediated through the autophagy signaling pathway. Since autophagy controls oxidative mediated inflammation and rescues macrophages from inflammatory processes (53), the effect of the isocaloric KD–FGF21–autophagy axis on macrophages provides a clear health benefit.  Our results suggest that low caloric intake or fasting was not necessary to induce ketosis. Isocaloric KD for 3 days is sufficient to mobilize fat depot with incremental rise in BHB levels and to improve glucose metabolism by increasing insulin sensitivity.",dac3fc6a-1b96-467e-a7ea-f660e4561710
