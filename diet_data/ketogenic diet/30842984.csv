0,introduction0,"CNS malignancies are devastating diagnoses, and current therapies leave much to be desired. Standard treatment often consists of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy; these therapies are generally not curative, and in many cases prolongation of survival is modest at best. For glioblastoma (GBM) – the most common primary malignant brain tumor – median overall survival is approximately 15–18 months (Ostrom et al., 2014; Woolf and Scheck, 2015; Nabors et al., 2017). Lower grade gliomas (i.e., WHO grade 2 and grade 3 glioma, as opposed to grade 4 glioma which is synonymous with glioblastoma (GBM)) carry better prognoses, but not by much. In adults, depending on grade and tumor subtype (e.g., oligodendroglioma vs. astrocytoma, IDH1-mutant vs. IDH1-wild-type) survival can range from a months to over a decade (Scorsetti et al., 2015; Society, 2017). Unfortunately, the vast majority of adults diagnosed with a glioma of any grade ultimately succumb to the disease.",cde4e0a0-f00e-4696-9f50-e838ca4eff97
1,introduction1,"  Given this context, it is understandable that many patients with CNS malignancies often seek complementary or alternative therapies, including dietary intervention. One such intervention gaining attention in the cancer community is the ketogenic diet (Zhou et al., 2007; Paoli et al., 2011; Schmidt et al., 2011; Khodadadi et al., 2017; Klement, 2017). The ketogenic diet is an established and effective treatment for epilepsy, with use for refractory pediatric epilepsy dating back to the 1920s (Hartman and Vining, 2007). More recently, the ketogenic diet has been proposed as an adjunct treatment for a range of medical conditions including diabetes, weight loss, cancer, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases (Hartman and Vining, 2007; Rho and Stafstrom, 2012; Hull et al., 2016).  The ketogenic diet is a high fat, moderate protein, and low carbohydrate diet that results in the endogenous production of ketones.",4cde7846-bc3b-4444-89ab-90971f16d4c6
2,introduction2," Unlike other tissues, the CNS is normally solely dependent on glucose as a source of energy; when glucose availability is limited, ketones are metabolized as an alternative energy source. Additionally, ketones serve as substrates for biosynthetic reactions and have cell signaling function . The effects of a ketogenic diet are manifold, and theories abound as to its potential anti-neoplastic properties . Chief among them is the idea that the reliance – and perhaps “addiction” – of cancer cells on glucose and glycolysis renders them susceptible to strategies that reduce glucose availability (Gatenby and Gillies, 2004; Kroemer and Pouyssegur, 2008). This observation of a cancer cell’s usage of aerobic glycolysis is known as the Warburg effect (Xie et al., 2014; Meidenbauer et al., 2015; Woolf and Scheck, 2015; Strickland and Stoll, 2017).",bb8486f4-826d-4c58-a74e-dc301d3be73f
3,introduction3," Up to 60–80% of cancers exhibit the Warburg effect; however, brain tumors tend to exhibit the Warburg effect at higher rates . As cancer cells are dependent on abundant levels of glucose, a ketogenic diet may put the cancer cells under metabolic stress and inhibit or delay the cancer’s growth . Other studies point to potential anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative effects, decreased substrates for macromolecular synthesis, as well as possible effects on oxidative stress, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the regulation of gene expression (Johnson et al., 2007; Jarrett et al., 2008; Cotter et al., 2013; Woolf and Scheck, 2015; Youm et al., 2015; Hull et al., 2016). However, clinical data from actual patients with CNS malignancies is limited.  In our institution, the groundswell of interest in the ketogenic diet helped spur a collaboration between patients, oncology dietitians, and neuro-oncologists.",41f0ed30-0a74-4955-8866-f48a7b92c95e
4,introduction4," In March 2015 we launched a pilot project for patients that included close dietary supervision with regular monitoring of glucose and ketone levels, body weight and composition, and clinical outcomes. Patients who participated in the initial project were also given the opportunity to use proprietary prepared ketogenic meals as part of their meal plans. As interest in the ketogenic diet continues to grow, our clinical practice has now shifted to discussing the potential risks and benefits of the diet with interested patients on a regular basis, with careful emphasis on the lack of robust clinical evidence to date. The data we have collected is presented here as a retrospective analysis.  ",0a873cf6-f468-45a7-838d-3488f075d5ea
5,methods0," Patients diagnosed with CNS malignancies following a ketogenic diet were identified between 2015 and 2017. Malignancies included confirmed diagnoses of glioblastoma (glioblastoma (GBM)), astrocytoma, or oligodendroglioma. With guidance from a registered dietitian, ketone levels, glucose levels, and weight were regularly collected for several patients along with patient-reported symptoms and adverse effects. Interested patients were asked to follow a 3:1 ketogenic diet for 120 days. The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, moderate protein, and very low carbohydrate diet, where patients limited carbohydrate intake to ≤20 g per day. Brain imaging was reviewed. A series of descriptive analyses were conducted.  Patients We identified 12 patients diagnosed with CNS malignancies seen at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center between 2015 and 2018 who saw a registered dietitian. Malignancies included a confirmed diagnosis of glioblastoma (GBM), astrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma.",cafc71d2-8992-4258-98ca-455dcd63d037
6,methods1," This study summarizes treatment charts in a retrospective analysis. We extracted data including demographics, clinical diagnosis, MRI scans, blood, glucose and ketone levels, weight, clinical presentations, and adverse events from patient charts between March 1, 2015 through March 5, 2018 (data cut-off date).  All activities were conducted with prior approval and oversight from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center’s Institutional Research Board and Office of Research Compliance and Quality Improvement.  Description of Ketogenic Diet A registered dietitian advised patients on ketogenic diet implementation. Meals were provided by Epigenix Foundation to eight patients (cohort 1) for the first 30 days. Meals were provided on a weekly basis with the opportunity to modify meal plans at weekly intervals. Patients also had flexibility with snacks with guidance from the dietitian.",5ee63dad-6611-44ab-993a-831dfe5bc0ec
7,methods2," Regardless of modification, meal plans aimed for about 20% of total calories from protein, about 7% of calories from carbohydrates, and 73% (minimum) of calories from fat. The remaining patients received meal plans only (cohort 2). Interested patients were instructed to follow a 3:1 ketogenic diet for 120 days. Patients limited carbohydrate intake (including breads, rice, fruits, vegetables, and some dairy products) to ≤20 g of net carbohydrates per day.  A 3:1 ketogenic diet is accepted as a “classic” ketogenic diet for adults. This ratio refers to the amount of fat grams included relative to the net carbohydrate plus protein grams. Thus, a classic ketogenic diet aims for approximately 82% of total calories coming from fat. The purpose of a ketogenic diet is to generate a continuous state of ketosis, meaning low blood glucose and high circulating blood ketones.",d3e1a7cf-4074-495e-b396-5be831404b6d
8,methods3," Although levels of ketones and glucose fluctuate throughout the day, ideally ketones would be present throughout the duration of the diet.  Blood ketone and glucose levels were measured using the Precision Xtra Meter. Patients were trained how to use the Precision Xtra Meter and asked to measure these values every day in the morning and evening prior to eating. Several patients already self-initiated some variation of the diet prior to deciding to using the Precision Xtra for daily measurements. Thus, the baseline for most patients only reflected the day prior to our instructed guidelines for the ketogenic diet. Total daily ketone (D-βHB only) and glucose levels as measured by the Precision Xtra Meter were self-reported by eight patients into a database that generated daily reports to the neuro-oncologist and dietitian. Patients took pictures of their meters for confirmation. Four patients took measurements using urine strips; this data was excluded from quantitative analysis.",8470c1ac-6f42-4739-ae2b-ff95cd6eff6b
9,methods4," Ketosis was defined as maintaining average blood ketone levels >0.5 mM for the duration of the data collection period (120 days). This threshold is determined based on previous studies that have evaluated the ketogenic diet in advanced cancers . Blood ketone and glucose levels were measured in mM and mg/dL, respectively, and summarized as daily averages if more than one measurement was obtained. Glucose and ketone levels were still included in analysis if taken at different times than advised. The GKI was calculated by dividing glucose by ketones to obtain a ratio of glucose to ketone levels in the blood .  Body mass index was calculated based on weight and kg following the kg/m2 formula provided in the patient charts or dietitian progress notes. All symptom and survival data were retrospectively extracted from clinician and dietitian notes in the medical chart.",0b79bee5-35b9-4053-b8f8-43eb8b10072a
10,methods5," When reported, symptoms were summarized at baseline, 30 days, 60 days, and end of study including: fatigue, cognitive function, nausea/vomiting, constipation, energy, mood, and seizure control. A qualitative summary of patient symptom improvement was obtained based on reports from the treating providers. When available, the edmonton symptom assessment system (ESAS) , routinely collected as per our institutional standards, was used to measure symptoms at beginning and end of study. Disease progression was assessed using MRIs and radiologist report.  Analysis As this was a retrospective case series, data were not aggregated or summarized across patients. Descriptive and graphical summaries of individual-level patient data were provided in evaluable patients including BMI, glucose and ketone levels, and GKI. All analyses were completed using Stata (v15.0). ",4e70f7bb-3d2d-41a3-8864-eb11c956e412
11,results0," The ketogenic diet was initiated in 12 patients of which 8 patients contributed data on their blood glucose and ketone levels. The majority of patients were male (n = 10) with a median age of 45 (range 32–62). Diagnoses included glioblastoma (GBM) (n = 6), grade 2/3 astrocytomas (n = 5) and one patient with a grade 2 spinal cord astrocytoma. Ten of the 12 patients were receiving concurrent treatment; two received supportive care only. The majority of patients with evaluable data (n = 8) maintained ketone levels above 0.5 mM for the duration of 120-day period. Ketone levels generally increased from baseline while glucose levels and BMI decreased. Overall, patients reported improved symptoms over the course of the diet. Imaging also suggested improved disease control and reduction in vasogenic edema.  Conclusion: Taking advantage of a tumor’s metabolic inflexibility can have a positive impact on patients, particularly those with CNS malignancies.",c1f6d6ea-8afd-4a21-8f8c-e3bf90764279

Ketone levels increased from baseline in six patients at 30 days, 60 days, and end of study. Blood glucose levels also decreased from baseline in seven of eight patients. The relationship between blood ketone and glucose levels over the 120-study day period for each patient is shown in Figure 2. Peaks in ketones were observed between the 30-day and 60-day period with a general decline toward the end of the study. 30-day GKI ranged from 0.95 to 2.9, while end-of-study GKI ranged from 1.7 to 5.3, possibly reflecting less willingness to strictly follow the ketogenic diet by the end of the 120-day study.

17,results7," Patients who stopped the diet cited the following reasons: “too restrictive” (n = 2), “inconvenient” (n = 1), or desire to switch to a modified Atkins diet (n = 3). A modified Atkins diet is similar to the ketogenic diet in that it restricts carbohydrate intake, but is more flexible on protein intake and tends to be easier to maintain. Patients who switched to a modified Atkins did so on their own accord for the ease of maintaining during social situations. Diet was continued in five patients beyond the 120-day data collection period. At the time at data cut-off for this retrospective analysis, two patients were deceased due to progressive disease and 10 patients had stable disease (Table 3).

Blood glucose and ketone levels were monitored twice daily, as were body weight and body composition, clinical symptoms, and potential adverse effects. Clinical outcomes that were tracked include qualitative assessments of quality of life and neurocognitive function, seizure control, radiographic response, time-to-progression, and survival (Supplementary Figure 1).  All patients were adherent and were able to maintain average daily blood ketone levels greater than or equal to 0.",65fe6144-d6f2-4d0a-9c62-7bae843d6009
32,discussion1,"5 mM, which is typically recognized to be the threshold for nutritional ketosis. The ketogenic diet was generally well tolerated, with eight patients continuing with the diet or a low-carb, modified version of the diet on their own beyond the 120-day study period. As expected, glucose and ketone levels were observed to be inversely related, and patients who initiated a ketogenic diet or low-carb diet prior to the first blood ketone and glucose measures (Patients F and H) were able to reach ketosis very quickly (within the first week).  Notable differences in energy, mood, neuro-cognitive function and overall well being were observed in a qualitative assessment of the patients’ symptoms. In some cases, this may be due to a direct effect of the ketogenic diet on physiology; in others, it may reflect improved tolerability of chemotherapy and radiation therapy due to the diet.",6ec4d553-e68f-400e-8ac9-030425c4bf40
33,discussion2," Findings also suggest the ketogenic diet may assist with seizure control; the majority of patients who previously experienced seizures experienced a decrease in the number of seizures for the duration of the diet, and some patients were able to decrease the dosage of seizure medication. In four patients, imaging demonstrated reduction in contrast enhancement or T2 hyperintensity suggestive of radiographic response; in three of these patients, the ketogenic diet was instituted concurrently with chemotherapy (although for this patient population, radiographic responses to chemotherapy are relatively infrequent), and in one patient, radiographic response was noted following institution of the ketogenic diet in the absence of other treatment (Figure 4). Primary safety concerns of the ketogenic diet in this population pertained to weight loss and appetite, and meal plans and caloric goals were adjusted to maintain healthy weight and body composition.",e613bd7f-99e7-480b-b8dc-7c4367928cde
34,discussion3,"  FIGURE 4 Visual disease assessment pre and during ketogenic diet.  Despite the explosion of interest in the ketogenic diet in the brain tumor patient community, to date, the medical literature regarding use of a ketogenic diet for patients with CNS malignancies has been limited. Nebeling et al. (1995) reported positive responses in two children with astrocytoma. Zuccoli et al. (2010) reports on a single case report of a patient diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM) receiving standard therapy and following a restricted ketogenic diet. Schmidt et al. (2011) conducted a pilot study on 16 patients with advanced cancer which concluded that the ketogenic diet was tolerable with no severe adverse effects. More recently, a small clinical trial of 11 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) was performed in the Netherlands. Of the 11 patients who started the study protocol, nine reached ketosis and six completed the study period of 14 weeks. Overall survival ranged from 9.8 to 19.0 months.",8ef11224-d106-45fd-82a6-992ab40ba612
35,discussion4," The authors noted that a supportive partner and intensive counseling were essential for coping (Perez et al., 2019; van der Louw et al., 2019). In a recent single-center trial performed in the United Kingdom, 12 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) were randomized 1:1 to receive either a modified ketogenic diet or medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet. Recruitment rate was low, and only four patients completed the 3-month diet (Martin-McGill et al., 2020). Studies are further summarized in recent systematic reviews on this topic (Martin-McGill et al., 2018b; Schwartz et al., 2018).  Although the data described in this report are limited by the retrospective case series design, it is worth noting that the quantity of data and close monitoring of patients performed in this study is quite robust compared to most of the studies in the published literature regarding the ketogenic diet.",c26c99dd-9c1a-472f-b202-e928a4ac2d1f
36,discussion5," Indeed, the close tracking of point-of-care and patient-entered data used to monitor this cohort of patients has been largely feasible due to recent technological advancements, such as online data management tools and home blood ketone monitoring (which provide more accurate readings than urine ketone strips). Close tracking of blood glucose and ketone levels also provides strong internal validation of dietary adherence, and mitigates concerns related to the validity of patient reporting that can affect diet studies.  Several limitations of this analysis relate to the case series design. Given the retrospective nature of the report, some data were missing from selected patients, particularly in Cohort 2. Additionally, patients included in this case study were motivated, interested in adopting a ketogenic diet, and generally had good functional status at baseline. These factors may differ in an unselected patient population.",db3d9825-71f1-4c7c-9289-0d99ba35f615
37,discussion6," Close monitoring and data collection may also have impacted patient adherence. Conclusions regarding potential therapeutic effects are limited by small sample size, concurrent treatment, and lack of uniformity regarding diagnosis and stage of disease. On the other hand, the fact that patients with a wide array of diagnoses were all able to tolerate a ketogenic diet speaks to the general feasibility of this approach. Finally, although the commonly accepted metric of 0.5 mM was used as a threshold for determining nutritional ketosis, the ideal therapeutic range for ketosis in this patient population – if it exists – has yet to be elucidated.  Despite these limitations, the results of this case series and others should be further explored in the setting of prospective clinical trials.",68f433fd-3b87-44e6-9f18-1a459cbf18a6
38,discussion7," Findings from our study may inform the design of future studies; in particular, our experience has shed light on the importance of tracking neurocognitive function and quality of life for patients on a ketogenic diet, as well as the feasibility of tailoring meal plans based on daily assessments of blood glucose and ketone levels, body weight and composition, and clinical symptoms. Compared to two recent small trials that incorporated a ketogenic diet for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), adherence and ability to achieve and maintain ketosis in this patient cohort was comparatively straightforward (Martin-McGill et al., 2018a; van der Louw et al., 2019). One possible explanation is that patients that chose to participate in this study were generally clinically stable, and had already had some time to come to terms with their diagnosis.",2f14dd5f-76da-4888-9437-60b11e9bad02
39,discussion8," For patients in Cohort 1, it is also possible that having pre-packaged meals simplified the initial process of achieving ketosis, even though most patients eventually transitioned to home-prepared meals.  We are currently exploring the feasibility and safety of the ketogenic diet in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT03451799) for patients with recently diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM). In addition to assessing feasibility, safety, and clinical outcomes, this trial will provide a wealth of additional data in the form of in-depth metabolic profiling, microbiome analysis, and tumor analysis. There are also other ongoing studies currently evaluating the ketogenic diet (NCT03328858, NCT03160599, NCT02694094) at other institutions. Clinicaltrials.gov currently lists over 100 trials looking at the ketogenic diet and approximately 12 of those trials include conditions related to CNS malignancies.  There is also great interest in extending metabolic therapy beyond utilization of a ketogenic diet alone.",2b37fd40-f1b2-43e1-9bc4-92177524dcb5
40,discussion9," One option is to supplement the diet with exogenous ketones, either in salt or ester form, with the idea that higher levels of ketosis may have a greater antineoplastic effect. At this time, it is still unknown whether elevating ketone levels with exogeneous supplementation provides the same level of benefit as diet-induced ketosis. Another area of interest is combining the ketogenic diet with medications such as metformin or compounds that restrict glutamine availability in order to further increase metabolic stress on tumor cells . The optimal combination of therapies is not known at this time.  This case series contributes to the growing body of literature suggesting that a ketogenic diet is safe and feasible in patients with CNS malignancies. Radiographic responses were noted in several patients, although in most instances the diet was being administered along with concomitant therapy.",e5bbc0dd-3837-454c-bc56-1107013dfe0b
41,discussion10," In addition to the ongoing phase 1 trial at our institution, several other trials are also ongoing. We anticipate proceeding with a phase 2 trial powered to detect efficacy in the near future.  Conclusion In conclusion, the ketogenic diet was feasible in this cohort of patients with CNS malignancies. The benefits that were noted in this patient cohort were intriguing and not easily explained by mechanisms other than effects from the ketogenic diet. These effects warrant further examination in the form of prospective clinical trials.
