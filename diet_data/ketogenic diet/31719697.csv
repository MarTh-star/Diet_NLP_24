0,introduction0," The clinical optimization of immune checkpoint inhibitors has provoked a paradigm shift in the treatment of advanced cancers, implementing immunotherapy as a first- and second-line modality across many tumor types (1). The major advance of immunotherapy concerns the long-term increase in overall survival, as observed for treatment with antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), or programmed death–ligand 1 (PD-L1), compared with other standard therapies such as chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (2). However, 2 limitations affect this medical breakthrough. First, only a subset of cancers within each indication (melanoma, lung, kidney, bladder, head and neck tumors, etc.) responds to immune checkpoint blockade (immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)), leaving the majority of patients without clinical benefit.",f3c67cba-e6ea-4625-81ee-881ddefc4150
1,introduction1," Second, immune-related adverse events are frequent, largely unpredictable, and often debilitating, limiting the clinical use of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) (3). Several factors, including host genetics, the tumor mutational load, as well as environmental cues, may determine immune responses against cancer (4). While most efforts to understand cancer immune resistance largely focused on somatic alterations of cancer cells and their effects on the tumor microenvironment and lymphoid organs, relatively little information is available about environmental factors affecting the delicate balance between metabolism, microbiota, immunity, and oncogenesis (5–8). Potentially relevant environmental factors encompass diet, lifestyle (such as stress, exercise, and circadian rhythm), and past or present exposures to infectious agents and xenobiotics. Among these, the most easily actionable factor is diet.",9283a6dd-d8fd-445d-98e4-8f9a4abd6188
2,introduction2," Food not only represents a source of macronutrients and micronutrients required for fueling metabolism, but it also affects the homeostatic maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity, the composition of microbiota, and the function of the immune system. To date, a plethora of dietary patterns and functional supplements (nutraceuticals) have been assessed for potential health benefits, including cancer prevention (9). In 2010, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)) recognized the Mediterranean diet as an “intangible cultural heritage of humanity” (10). Calorie restriction reduces the risk of chronic disease, including cancer, and increases life expectancy by promoting autophagy (11, 12). Aside from caloric restriction, low protein consumption may restrain inflammation and improve anticancer immunosurveillance (13, 14).",edc05763-5a6f-4729-b229-9b2003a31d78
3,introduction3," Recently, several studies have suggested positive therapeutic effects of very low–carbohydrate ketogenic diets (KD) on several diseases, including cancer (15–17).  First described by Hans Krebs, ketosis is a metabolic state in which the body retrieves energy from the catabolism of ketone bodies (KB), as opposed to the normal state when glucose — and, to a lesser degree, fatty acids and amino acids — is the main source of energy. KB include acetylacetate (H3C–CO–CH2–COO–), β–D-hydroxybutyrate (H3C–CHOH–CH2–COO–), and volatile acetone (H3C–CO–CH3). KD are high-fat, moderate-protein, and low-carbohydrate (usually less than 40 g/day) diets (18), and they induce a surge in KB — in particular, 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB). This increase in 3HB also occurs after fasting, favoring mitochondrial respiration rather than glycolysis for energy metabolism. So far, the rationale to use KD to combat cancer was based on a cell-autonomous hypothesis.",3861ec20-042f-424e-8a8c-06745eec297d
4,introduction4," One hallmark of all cancer cells is the abnormal metabolic phenotype first described by Otto Warburg, which is characterized by a bioenergetic shift from oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis (19, 20). The Warburg phenomenon is linked to the overactivation of the insulin/IGF-1–dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR system, not only due to mutations in the genes that code for pathway proteins, but also due to chronic hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia (21–24). Therefore, a potential therapeutic strategy might involve KD, which reduces glucose availability to tumor cells, while providing KB as an alternative bioenergetic fuel to normal cells. On theoretical grounds, this should result in selective starvation of tumor cells, which are unable to adapt to ketone metabolism as a result of their acquired metabolic inflexibility and genomic instability.",b2c8e4d8-504c-4341-8915-b8f5817f5b09
5,introduction5," This is emphasized by the fact that various tumors display reduced levels of 2 enzymes involved in KB catabolism (O-hydroxy-butyrate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA-acetoacetate-CoA transferase) (25–28).  Several diseases involving alterations in mitochondrial metabolism — such as epilepsy (29), diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, neurological disorders, and cancer — may benefit from KD (30–33). However, most of the knowledge of the beneficial effects of KD on cancer relies on a cell-autonomous vision of malignancy, as well as on epidemiological studies rather than experimental animal models. We and others highlighted the intertwined relationship between the composition of the microbiota and antitumor immune responses in advanced-cancer bearers treated with immunotherapy (8, 34). Therefore, bridging the gap linking dietary habits to clinical outcomes following immunotherapy remains an open challenge.",be720343-05ad-4bf0-b7bf-1ebc6954a58e
6,introduction6,"  Here, we use preclinical tumor models to address the functional impact of KD and KB on the host immune system and tumor immunosurveillance, highlighting the immunomodulatory properties of KD and the most abundant KB, which is 3HB. We found both that KD and 3HB influence the balance between immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive pathways, thereby improving the antitumor effects of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).

We analyzed the antitumor effects of an ad libitum nutritional KD (called KetoCal) based on a 4:1 fat/protein ratio compared with a vitamin and mineral-matched control diet (normal diet, ND) in C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice reared in specific pathogen–free (specific pathogen–free (SPF)) conditions. KD was initiated the day of tumor inoculation and pursued for 12 consecutive days, and tumor progression was monitored twice a week. As compared with ND, KD reduced the growth of transgenic melanoma (reduced the growth of transgenic melanoma (RET)) inoculated orthotopically into the skin (Figure 1, A and B). Moreover, KD delayed the progression of a luciferase-expressing renal cancer (renal cancer (RENCA)) implanted into the subcapsular area of kidneys from BALB/c mice, preventing tumor outgrowth in less than half of cases, while the other animals harbored smaller tumors (Figure 1, C and D).",f4e6f26e-6b9c-44ef-8baa-c8033dd8f440
31,results1," These effects advantageously compared with regimens of short-term starvation or food supplements that we used in the past to improve anticancer immunosurveillance (12, 35).  Thus far, in accordance with the literature dealing with other cancer models (35–39), KD attenuated tumor progression in orthotopic models of aggressive neoplasia.  3HB is the bioactive metabolite of KD.  There were no significant differences in food consumption or weight gain between mice fed KD versus ND (Figure 2A). To identify the metabolic changes associated with ad libitum KD in tumor bearers, we performed a comprehensive metabolomic profiling of plasma, liver, and heart tissues from 24 reduced the growth of transgenic melanoma (RET) melanoma–bearing mice receiving either ND or KD at day 10, with the time corresponding to disease control for most animals.",1f1c5b7d-68d1-483b-bc09-cd41bde2d0f3
32,results2," Nonsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal coordinate analyses (principal coordinate analyses (PCA)) revealed major differences between ND and KD (Figure 2, B and C, and Supplemental Table 1; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.145207DS1). KB including acetoacetate, 2-hydroxybutyrate (2HB), and 3HB — as well as carnitine derivatives (such as 3-methylglutaryl carnitine and the acetyl carnitine/carnitine ratio), short-chain saturated carboxylic acids (such as behenic acid), and polyamines (in particular, N1-acetyl spermidine and the putrescine/ornithine ratio) — were markedly elevated in the plasma and other tissues from mice fed with KD (Figure 2, D and E; Supplemental Table 1; and Supplemental Figure 1).",265b19a1-a781-4fb9-bd9f-3ac09f8282de
33,results3," In contrast, acetylcholine, a range of acyl phosphatidylcholines (PCae), palmitate (the most abundant saturated fatty acid), several monounsaturated fatty acids, propionate, and hippurate were significantly decreased by KD compared with ND (Figure 2B and Supplemental Table 1), suggesting the catabolism of fatty acids through β-oxidation.  Importantly, the plasma levels of 3HB, but not those of acetoacetate, negatively correlated with the size of reduced the growth of transgenic melanoma (RET) melanomas (Figure 2F). Driven by this correlation, we attempted to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between systemic KB and KD-mediated anticancer effects. For this, we replaced KD by administration of 3HB per os (3HBpo). While an established protocol (4.2% 3HB drinking water) (36) caused a modest increase in plasma 3HB (0.5 and 1 mM), a higher dose (12.6% 3HB) allowed to achieve KD-related serum levels ≥3 mM (Supplemental Figure 2).",1db9eec6-6a40-481a-b9db-72aca6b4d869
34,results4," Of note, in healthy individuals, blood concentrations of total ketones are generally less than 0.5 mmol/L (equivalent to 52.05 mg/L of 3HB), whereas after 6–7 days, fasting blood ketone concentrations can be 5–7 mmol/L (equivalent to 520.5–728.7 mg/L of 3HB), which is called starvation ketosis (37). Blood ketone concentrations in diabetic patients with ketoacidosis may exceed 25 mmol/L (38, 39). At this dose of 12.6%, 3HBpo retarded reduced the growth of transgenic melanoma (RET) melanoma growth as much as KD retarded this growth, both in terms of kinetics and complete responses (Figure 3, A and B). Similarly, when 3HB was injected systemically (i.p.) to obtain KD-like pharmacokinetics, it mimicked the antitumor effects of KD (Figure 3, A and B, and Supplemental Figure 2). Of note, blockade of the 3HB receptor, GTP coupled receptor 109A (GPR109A) by means of mepenzolate bromide (C21H26BrNO3) (40) abolished the control of tumor progression by 3HBpo, as well as by KD (Figure 3C).",7a8fcc64-c2aa-4ce8-8ee3-4931109de005
35,results5," Similarly, when KetoCal, the usual KD, was supplemented with sucrose (5% in the drinking water), the induction of KB (3HB and acetate) was prevented and the anticancer effect of KD was lost (Figure 3, D–F, and Supplemental Figure 3).  Altogether, we conclude that KD reduces the growth kinetics of aggressive orthotopic cancers as a stand-alone treatment modality, at least in part through the pharmacological activity of 3HB on its receptor GPR109A.  Contribution of microbial shifts and T lymphocytes to KD-mediated tumor growth control.  Oral intake of food or supplements can be expected to influence the intestinal microbiota. Indeed, the 16S rRNA sequencing of stools harvested at day 10 of KD in reduced the growth of transgenic melanoma (RET) tumor bearers revealed significant deviations in the β diversity of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Multidimensional principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on the Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity Index unraveled significant (P = 0.",fb8962e5-a79d-4018-94ac-3080d81de015
36,results6,"001, PERMANOVA test) compositional differences in ND versus KD samples (Figure 4A). Bacterial taxa with differential abundance between ND and KD groups were used as input for the linear discriminant analysis (linear discriminant analysis (LDA)) to calculate an effect size (LEfSe analysis). KD induced an overrepresentation of Akkermansia muciniphila, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, and Pseudoflavonifractor capillosus, but a relative loss of more than 10 species belonging to the Lactobacillaceae family (Figure 4, B and C, and Supplemental Figure 4, A and B). When analyzing taxa of low prevalence that were not considered in the LEfSe analysis, we found that the relative abundance of Eisenbergiella massiliensis (Figure 4C, right panel) and T. sanguinis (Supplemental Figure 4B) were increased and decreased, respectively, in the stools of KD-fed mice, compared with ND.  We next assessed the effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics (antibiotics (ATB)) on the anticancer activity of KD and 3HB.",858b4f41-1b4b-4118-95c7-a74d312b0ae9
37,results7," antibiotics (ATB) tended — albeit not significantly — to reduce the protective effect of both nutritional interventions against reduced the growth of transgenic melanoma (RET) melanoma outgrowth (Figure 4D). In a Spearman correlation matrix integrating all bacterial taxa and KB, we found that Eisenbergiella massiliensis was at the center of the KB-related metacluster (Figure 5A). Indeed, its relative abundance in feces correlated with the plasma concentrations of the 2 KB (acetoacetate and 3HB), only in KD-treated mice and not in ND controls (Figure 5, A–C, and Supplemental Figure 4C).  To analyze the clinical relevance of these findings, we turned to an epidemiological study linking food ingredients, systemic inflammatory markers and gut microbiota— the Personalized Responses to Dietary Composition Trial (PREDICT-1) — that enrolled 1000 participants (mono and dizygotic healthy twins from the Twins UK cohort, and nontwin healthy individuals).",0d275153-aec0-4eb9-b3d1-8af9cc1e18c1
38,results8," This trial consisted of collecting food questionnaires, plasma metabolomics, and shotgun metagenomics data (41). We analyzed correlations between plasma KB concentrations, carbohydrate consumption (using an estimate of carbohydrates normalized to energetic contribution; carb%E), and the intestinal OTUs identified in the murine KD fingerprint. Again, E. massiliensis positively correlated with 3HB and acetoacetate (P < 0.05) in humans, while Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Prevotella copri anticorrelated with plasma KB levels (Figure 5D). Turicibacter sanguinis and P. capillosus positively and negatively correlated with carb%E, respectively (Figure 5D).  Given the reported immunostimulatory capacity of distinct OTUs selected from the KD (such as A. muciniphila) (42), we next analyzed the effects of T cell depletion on the tumor growth–reducing effect of KD and 3HBpo.",19806113-43fd-406c-b380-daf90f830c43
39,results9," Both nutritional interventions lost their anticancer effects in mice injected with antibodies against CD4 and CD8 (Figure 6A).  In conclusion, KD and 3HB mediate their antitumor activity not through direct, cancer cell–autonomous mechanisms, but rather through effects on the host immune system.  Synergistic antitumor effects of ketogenic interventions with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).  Driven by the consideration that KD or 3HB induce T cell–dependent anticancer effects, we combined these nutritional interventions with the most powerful combination of immunostimulatory mAbs in the clinics, thus targeting both PD-1 and CTLA-4.",4deeb9af-8352-4038-ad3f-e4269e5cb1d7
40,results10," In the reduced the growth of transgenic melanoma (RET) melanoma model, diet-based host conditioning increased the efficacy of combination immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) (cimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB); anti–PD-1 plus anti–CTLA-4), with significant differences observed as early as after the first systemic injection of cimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) (Figure 6, B and C). In the context of complete cimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) regimen (3 i.p. injections over a 6-day period), 3HBpo boosted the tumor growth–inhibitory activity of cimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB), prolonging overall survival of almost 60% of reduced the growth of transgenic melanoma (RET) tumor bearers (Figure 6D). 3HBpo was superior to KD, although both nutritional interventions led to an increase in the cimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-induced pool of type 1 CD8+ T cells (Tc1) (CXCR3+CD8+) splenocytes (Figure 6E).",de7529c0-6d81-44a5-ac9f-164447c5cffe
41,results11," Of note, both diet interventions tended to mobilize the recirculation of patrolling activated monocytes by day 5 (Supplemental Figure 5, C–E). The improvement of cimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-induced tumor growth reduction conferred by KD was lost upon supplementation with sucrose, which breaks ketogenesis (Figure 6F).  Given that most nutritional interventions are prescribed in intermittent courses to limit the constraints on the users, we compared continuous versus discontinuous (1 week on, 1 week off) regimens of the KD or 3HBpo (Figure 7, A and B) in the reduced the growth of transgenic melanoma (RET) tumor model. Surprisingly, the combined effect of 3HBpo and cimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) tended to be favored by the intermittent schedule (Figure 7B).",f56f0e7a-bf3b-4126-953d-51c8301a8f2a
42,results12," In this latter setting, flow cytometry analyses of splenocytes revealed that the On/off regimen of 3HBpo alone decreased the expression of activation/exhaustion markers (such as CTLA-4 and CD223, best known as Lag-3) on CD4+ T cells (Supplemental Figure 5A), and prevented the cimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-induced upregulation of Lag-3 and CD137 (best known as 4-1BB) on CD8+ T cells (Supplemental Figure 5B). In contrast, the combination of cimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and intermittent 3HBpo boosted the expression of CTLA-4 on CD8+ T cells but simultaneously reduced the expression of CD86, the CTLA-4 ligand, on splenic myeloid cells (Figure 7, C and D). Conversely, while PD-1 remained stable, the expression of its ligand PD-L1 was significantly decreased on splenic macrophages during the combinatorial therapeutic regimen (Figure 7E).",eb70f06c-0fac-4244-b833-1a4455ceec05
43,results13," To confirm that 3HBpo contributes to restrain PD-L1 expression despite the presence of a pool of Tc11 cells producing the PD-L1 promoting cytokine IFN-γ in vivo (43), we exposed BM-derived myeloid antigen–presenting cells to 3HB prior to exposure to recombinant IFN-γ (rIFN-γ) in vitro. Indeed, low (micromolar) concentrations of 3HB reduced the IFN-γ–induced upregulation of PD-L1 membrane expression but not that of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (MHC II) (Figure 7, F and G). Of note, 3HB did not modulate IFN-γ–induced upregulation of PD-L1 membrane expression on tumor cells (Supplemental Figure 5C). In summary, when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), ketogenic regimens (KD or 3HB) induced the splenic accumulation of CXCR3+ Tc1 and induced the upregulation of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on CD8+ T cells, but it prevented the expression of their ligands on splenic macrophages, setting the stage for prolonged systemic T cell activation.",1c3ea649-8ac6-4059-973a-8baf9d8e8807
44,results14,"  We next turned to orthotopic models of established carcinomas to evaluate the efficacy of KD in the context of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Established renal cancer (RENCA)s were best controlled when their BALB/c hosts were treated with cimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) plus KD or 3HB, but only when the nutritional interventions were applied intermittently (Figure 8A and Supplemental Figure 6A). We next selected an aggressive orthotopic TC-1 lung cancer tumor model, which is primarily resistant to anti–PD-1 or anti–CTLA-4 Abs, as stand-alone therapies (Supplemental Figure 6B). Importantly, the only efficient regimen that led to the eradication of established tumors (in > 70% of the cases), allowing for long-term survival of most of the C57BL/6J hosts, was the combination of intermittent 3HBpo and anti–PD-1 mAbs (Figure 8, B–D). Mice that had been diagnosed with TC-1 lung cancers (by bioluminescence imaging) and then cured by the combination of 3HBpo and anti–PD-1 resisted s.c.",e0b412b4-9003-4548-bf70-060fc673654d
45,results15," rechallenge with TC-1 cancers, yet readily developed MCA205 fibrosarcomas, indicating that they developed a specific long-term protective immune response (Figure 8, E and F, and Supplemental Figure 6C).  Altogether, these results support the idea that ketogenic regimens can enhance the anticancer effects of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in multiple orthotopic tumor models, including melanoma, renal, and non–small cell lung cancer. ",e149a8fa-4848-48cb-874f-362a8d5ef65f
46,discussion0," So far, the rationale to use KD for combating neoplasia was based on a cell-autonomous hypothesis. Here, we highlight a non–cell autonomous mechanism of action of KD that can be exploited to ameliorate anticancer therapies. KD — and, more specifically, 3HB — induce immunostimulatory effects in secondary lymphoid organs that are important for natural and therapy-induced immunosurveillance.  Oral administration of 3HB increased the expansion of CD8+ T cells elicited by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), while restraining the expression of activation/exhaustion markers such as CTLA-4, Lag-3, and 4-1BB/CD137 in the spleen. Concomitantly, 3HB limited the IFN-γ–induced PD-L1 and CD86 expression on splenic macrophages in vivo (for both) and in vitro (for PD-L1), reducing a negative feedback signal operating after T cell receptor (T cell receptor (TCR)) engagement. The poor expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 receptor ligands may maintain T cell activation and fitness in secondary lymphoid organs.",1f7a2e24-1007-4233-8499-185f07458cec
47,discussion1," Of note, pioneering work highlighted the pivotal role of PD-L1 expression by antigen presenting cells in the efficacy of PD-1 blockade (44–46), suggesting that KD may be pivotal to prime the host for a full-blown immune response to immune checkpoint inhibition. One single report (47) indicated the capacity of KD to elicit systemic innate immune responses through IL-17–producing γδ T cells during virus infection. However, in this report (47), KB — including 3HB — could not substitute for KD to stimulate antiviral immunity. This is different from our observation that KD and 3HB have similar immune-dependent antitumor effects. Moreover, in tumor-bearing mice, we failed to observe any effects of KD on γδ T and NK innate effectors (data not shown).",85b029f9-6257-4d23-8787-f34f9892021c
48,discussion2,"  Importantly, KD and 3HB slowed natural tumor progression in the absence of additional therapeutic intervention, but they also accelerated and improved the efficacy of cimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) against established and aggressive orthotopic melanoma, lung, and renal cell cancers. This anticancer effect was blunted by sucrose supplementation (in the case of KD) or by blocking the 3HB receptor (for both KD and 3HB). Indeed, T cells and GPR109A engagement were mandatory for the full-blown anticancer properties of 3HB, paving the way to the accelerated efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).  As expected, KD markedly affected the composition of the gut microbiota, shifting the balance from tolerogenic (Lactobacilli spp., C. asparagiforme) toward immunogenic bacteria (such as A. muciniphila) (48). Of note, immunogenic bacteria can share antigens with oncogenic drivers and boost the cognate T cell arm of immune responses (49).",7e3baf18-4b5e-44ed-b051-0d01cbd465de
49,discussion3," However, several arguments indicate that the modulation of the microbiota does not play a central role in the anticancer effects of KD. First, antibiotics did not significantly compromise the anticancer efficacy of the KD or 3HB. Second, the i.p. administration that mimics parenteral administration in mice of 3HB recapitulated the findings obtained with KD. Third, we failed to observe additive effects of prebiotics and probiotics in the same cancer models (not shown). All these lines of evidence argue in favor of a direct (microbiota-independent) immunostimulatory action of KD.  Interestingly, our data appear to indicate that intermittent administration of 3HB might be more beneficial than the continuous regimen, alone or in combination with cimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB). A large body of literature reports that intermittent fasting, which leads to discontinuous ketogenesis, is associated with improved health (50–52).",5ac4226f-6bc0-4b24-b0be-6984fea86caf
50,discussion4," Moreover, intermittent KD can improve the health span of mice more efficiently than continuous KD (53). Indeed, cyclic KD may prevent high-fat diet–associated obesity, resulting in long-term maintenance of normal weight, and cyclic KD resulted in higher plasma levels of β-hydroxybutyrate than continuous KD, particularly during daytime (53). More work will be needed to delineate the immunological and/or metabolic mechanisms underpinning these effects in cancer patients.  Regardless of these limitations, the present work has important implications, as previously discussed, not only for obese individuals and athletes, but also in brain and endometrial cancer patients (54–56). KD might be implemented prior, or concomitantly, to anticancer therapies (including immunogenic chemotherapy and immunotherapy) with the scope of potentiating their immunostimulatory effects, reducing the number of therapeutic cycles, and achieving a higher rate of complete cures.",77d58107-ecbc-4dcf-92b3-9151f16cff3f
51,discussion5," Given the poor palatability of KD and the consequent lack of compliance, as well as the potential toxicity of KD on the cardiovascular system (57), substitution of KD by its main metabolite 3HB represents an attractive option. Numerous clinical trials are underway to evaluate KD either as a stand-alone cancer treatment, for instance in children with brain tumors (NCT03328858, NCT03955068) or adults with advanced cancers (NCT01716468), or in association with other treatments such as chemotherapy (NCT03535701) and hormonotherapy (NCT03962647) in breast cancers, as well as chemoradiation in lung cancers (NCT01419587). Only 1 trial is investigating the effect of a ketogenic drink on perioperative and oncologic outcomes in cancer patients (NCT03510429; https://clinicaltrials.gov/).  Prospective randomization and appropriate pharmacodynamics markers will be necessary to adjust dosing and scheduling, as well as the clinical endpoints of these studies.",6a70dedc-57f1-4fd0-8aaf-5e283bfcd5cd
52,discussion6," Our findings emphasize that not only metabolic and inflammation-related parameters, but also immunological parameters, must be evaluated to appreciate the impact of nutritional interventions on cancer. ",89f5c915-474e-44b8-97db-82c2986be8e8
