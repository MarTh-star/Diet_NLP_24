0,introduction0,"Glioblastoma multiforme (Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)) is the most aggressive type of brain tumor. Despite surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, these patients have an average life expectancy of 12–18 months and less than 10% survive 5 years [1]. Although there have been advances in the development of novel targeted treatments, these therapies face the challenge of overcoming phenotypic variability resulting from tumor heterogeneity. One phenotypic trait shared by virtually all cancer cells is dysregulation of metabolism.  A metabolic shift toward glycolysis regardless of oxygen availability has been observed in Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and a variety of other cancers. This phenomenon, first described by Otto Warburg and called the Warburg Effect [2], supports the synthesis of biomolecules needed to sustain rapid proliferation, reducing utilization of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.",f717f2c6-65fd-45ed-bdb7-07da4e39857d
1,introduction1," This aberrant metabolism found in tumor cells is now considered a hallmark of cancer [3] and a potential therapeutic target [4]. One novel approach to targeting tumor metabolism is through the use of a therapeutic ketogenic diet (KD). The KD is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that has been implemented in the non-pharmacologic treatment of refractory epilepsy. We and others have demonstrated that this diet enhances survival in preclinical models of malignant gliomas [5]. We also found that the KD altered the expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response and reduced reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) in tumors [6]. reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are often increased in cancer [7] and they play a role in a variety of pathways including tumor angiogenesis and growth through the regulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) pathway [8].",44a7c3c3-e407-4872-8758-ba77381bbea0
2,introduction2," Further, we demonstrated that radiation in combination with KD was synergistic, and survival was significantly increased over radiation treatment alone [9]. While the preclinical work on the KD has led to a limited number of clinical trials, the mechanisms through which the KD exerts its anti-tumor effects have not been fully elucidated.  Pathways long known to be associated with tumor cell growth, escape from apoptosis, angiogenesis, and therapy resistance have now been linked to cellular metabolism. For example, hypoxia is a fundamental biological phenomena commonly found in Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). It drives glycolysis, energy metabolism and other malignant processes including angiogenesis and invasion [10]. HIF-1 is the key transcriptional regulator of the hypoxic response, upregulating many critical genes involved with tumor progression.",e1162c27-38e6-4c26-9b8c-d6f9a95c8f92
3,introduction3," HIF-1 activation facilitates neoangiogenesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix (extracellular matrix (ECM)) by upregulating expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its associated receptors, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Further, the malignant hallmarks driven by hypoxia and HIF-1 expression have been implicated in radio- and chemo-resistance, leading to poor patient prognosis [11].  The current study explores the KD in the context of tumor hypoxia and angiogenesis. We show for the first time that the KD given ad libitum significantly reduces the key modulators of hypoxic response: carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) and HIF-1α, and decreases the activation of nuclear factor—kappa B (NF-κB). In addition, we found that the KD reduces the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2 while decreasing tumor microvasculature and altering the expression of several other proteins that modify the tumor microenvironment during hypoxia.",6279ed28-212d-45b4-b4a4-dd91b2740bf8
4,introduction4, Our findings suggest that the KD affects the expression of key proteins involved with the hypoxic response that drives tumor growth and progression.  ,27688eaa-034c-4045-b8a9-b0e18255fc9d
5,methods0,"To explore the effects of the KD on various aspects of tumor growth and progression, we used the immunocompetent, syngeneic GL261-Luc2 mouse model of malignant glioma.  Ethics statement This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center (protocol number 334 (A3510-01)).

KC is a nutritionally complete diet providing a 4:1 ratio of fats to carbohydrates plus protein (72% fat, 15% protein, and 3% carbohydrate). KC paste (2:1 mix of KC and water) was provided to animals daily. Tumor burden was quantified by bioluminescence as described [6]. Serum β-hydroxybutyrate and glucose levels were measured using a Precision Xtra blood monitoring system (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) and animals were weighed every 3–4 days.   In vivo imaging of hypoxia At 21 days post-implantation, HypoxiSense680 (2 nmol/100 μl; PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA) was administered by intraperitoneal injection and animals were imaged 24 hours later using the IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system (675 ex/720 em;).",1a76f7aa-d838-4a44-83d9-4adbab2a579c

KC reduces in vivo expression of carbonic anhydrase IX To determine the effect of the KC on hypoxia, the fluorescent imaging agent HypoxiSense 680 was used to detect in vivo expression of the hypoxia marker carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) on the surface of tumor cells. Animals maintained on KC had a statistically significant reduction in HypoxiSense 680 signal when compared to animals fed SD (Fig 2A and 2B). Tumor bearing animals were imaged prior to injection of the probe to quantitate signal generated by tissue autofluorescence (Fig 2B). Non-tumor bearing mice were injected with the probe and imaged 24 hours later to quantitate non-specific binding of the probe (Fig 2B).

Of those genes, Vegfb, Plau, Timp1, Tek, and Itgb1 were expressed significantly lower in the tumors from animals fed a KC when compared to tumors from animals fed SD.  KC alters the expression of genes involved in invasive potential We analyzed tumor invasive potential by performing western blot analysis on tumor tissue to determine the expression levels of vimentin, MMP-9 and both the pro-form and the proteolytically processed activated form of MMP-2. Tumors from animals maintained on KC showed a significant reduction in both the pro- (72 KDa) and activated (65 KDa) form of MMP-2 as well as a reduction in expression of vimentin (Fig 6A and 6B).

KC reduces peritumoral edema The reduction in angiogenesis suggested that animals maintained on KC may have a reduction in peritumoral edema. MRI analysis on day 14 following implantation was done to measure edema (Fig 7A), which is reflected by an increase in T2. Results show a statistically significant 2-fold decrease in peritumoral edema in animals fed KC when compared to those fed SD (Fig 7B). To demonstrate that the reduction in edema with the KC was not purely a function tumor size, bioluminescent tumor signals from the same day were analyzed and there was no statistical difference in signal between groups (Fig 7C).  10.1371/journal.pone.0130357.g007Fig 7 Peritumoral edema measurements.",d729e026-3181-4925-a4c4-51d94fee2edb

KC influences expression of tight junction proteins and aquaporins Western blot analysis of tumor tissue was performed to analyze the expression of proteins involved with peritumoral edema and glioma progression including the tight junction proteins, ZO-1 and occludin, as well as the water channeling proteins, AQPN-1, AQPN-4. Tumors from animals fed KC had a significant increase in the expression of ZO-1 but no difference in occludin expression (Fig 8A and 8B).

23,discussion0,"Hypoxia is a fundamental biological phenomena found in a variety of solid tumors. HIF-1 activity is regulated by rapid stabilization of the HIF1α subunit and acts as a crucial transcriptional factor in the cellular response to hypoxia [15]. HIF-1 can facilitate angiogenesis and invasion through upregulation of various target genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors and MMPs [15]. CA IX expression is also controlled by HIF-1α and is thus considered a marker for hypoxia. Overexpression of CA IX is common in malignant glioma and correlates with poor patient survival [16]. The current study found a reduction in the expression of HIF-1α and CA IX in tumors from animals maintained on the KD, suggesting reduced hypoxia in these tumors.",2bcbf1e3-3afd-4c13-981b-45bdb179510e
24,discussion1," We propose that the resulting alterations in angiogenesis, specifically involving the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, may be a factor in the anti-tumor effect seen with the KD. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that tumor growth and progression can be limited by targeting angiogenesis [17].  In this study we demonstrated that the KD significantly reduced protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2, the main receptor responsible for modulating tumor angiogenesis [18]. Recent studies have shown that selective inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2 tyrosine kinase induces a radiologic response, normalizes tumor vasculature, and reduces edema while increasing patient quality of life [17].",c2f3995b-4c87-40ce-9080-120003f8f0d6
25,discussion2," Further, it has been suggested that a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2 blockade creates a ""normalization window"" where vessel structure is normalized and hypoxia is reduced, enhancing radiation therapy in human glioblastoma xenograft models [19]. In our studies, total vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at the protein level was not significantly altered by the KD however RNA analysis showed a significant decrease in the expression of Vegfb. Although the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)B in tumor angiogenesis is not well understood, it may be important for angiogenic processes in a context dependent manner [20]. Decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)B expression is associated with improved survival and may be an indicator of response to anti-angiogenic therapies in ovarian cancer patients [21].",ec80b3b9-bb31-4127-9c68-8edce753a707
26,discussion3," Bevacizumab, the only FDA-approved anti-angiogenesis drug for use in Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A [22]. While it is has been used for recurrent tumor, it often results in adverse side effects and there is considerable controversy as to its efficacy [23]. Bevacizumab can lead to increased regions of hypoxia, a more invasive, treatment-resistant glioma phenotype and enhanced MMP-2 activation [24]. MMPs remodel the extracellular matrix and alter surface protein expression. Increased expression and activation of MMP-2, which is linked to HIF-1α expression, can lead to cellular invasion and increased blood-brain barrier (blood brain barrier (BBB)) permeability [25]. Silencing pro-MMP-2 resulted in decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2 and enhanced radiosensitivity in a human xenograft model [26].",7811c518-2161-4c05-b5cf-b40e47a6e134
27,discussion4," Protein analysis of tumors from animals fed the KD showed reduced expression of both pro- and activated-MMP-2, and the mesenchymal marker, vimentin, which is upregulated in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)) that occurs within invasive glioma cells [27,28]. Together these results suggest that a KD may reduce the invasive potential of cells within the tumor. If metabolic therapy could be used to mimic the beneficial effects of bevacizumab it may provide a less toxic way to limit angiogenesis while limiting pro-invasive selection.  An additional reason angiogenesis presents a clinical challenge is that in contrast to healthy vessels, tumor vasculature is often immature, highly permeable, structurally and functionally abnormal [29]. This can impair delivery of therapeutic agents, alter the tumor microenvironment, drive tumor cell extravasation and allow for the rapid influx of inflammatory cells [30].",26335439-e42b-4e76-b90d-9e04c6ff323a
28,discussion5," Inflammation can lead to peritumoral edema, which is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with gliomas. Dexamethasone is the current treatment of choice for peritumoral inflammation and edema, yet it comes with adverse side effects such as hyperglycemia, cardiovascular effects, osteoporosis, weight gain, insomnia, increased susceptibility to infection and cognitive effects which ultimately reduce the quality of life for patients [31]. Hyperglycemia induced by corticosteroids has been linked to shorter survival and may have a negative impact on adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients [32–34].  The current study found a reduction in glucose and peritumoral edema in animals maintained on the KD when compared to those fed SD. Animals maintained on the KD also showed a significant reduction in activation of NF-κB in their tumors, which is another key regulator of the transcriptional response to hypoxia [35].",a266a87b-4d75-49f7-9d37-0d2824526658
29,discussion6," NF-κB is linked to various signal transduction pathways and to transcriptional activation events that mediate inflammation, cell proliferation, cell migration, and angiogenesis [36].  Leaky vasculature and disruption of the blood brain barrier caused by tumors is thought to occur in part because of defects in interendothelial tight junctions. ZO-1 and occludin are critical for maintaining the stability and functions of the tight junctions, and their loss is associated with increased blood brain barrier permeability [37]. ZO-1 expression was significantly increased in the tumors from animals fed the KD when compared to SD; however, there was no difference in expression of occludin. Further, both irradiation and hypoxic conditions have been implicated in the breakdown of the blood brain barrier (BBB) via down-regulation of ZO-1 expression in gliomas [38].",b7c35ba5-6b7f-4429-891c-957713a05b52
30,discussion7," Our results suggest that the KD may help mitigate peritumoral edema and blood brain barrier (BBB)-breakdown by preserving ZO-1 expression.  Brain edema and blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability are also propagated by HIF-1α expression which can increase expression of MMPs and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) [39]. Several groups have proposed the involvement of aquaporins in the pathophysiology of brain edema [40]. Aquaporins are the principle pathway for water movement across most cellular membranes. Of these, AQP1 and AQP4 proteins are found highly expressed in the most malignant gliomas [41]. The current study found a reduction in expression of AQP4 but not AQP1 in the tumors from animals fed a KD. In addition to its well-known function in brain edema, AQP4 has also been recently reported to play a role in cell migration, invasion and survival [40].",a1297ec3-ffba-4fc5-ae69-1ea7450a0b4c
31,discussion8," Further analysis of gene expression showed tumors in mice fed KC also had significantly lower expression of plasminogen activator urokinase (Plau) and angiopoeitin-1 receptor (Tek). Both are thought to play a central role in tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis [42]. PLAU inhibitors are being actively explored as anticancer strategies in glioblastomas and may have antiangiogenic properties [43,44]. TEK was also shown to be a key molecular regulator of pathological vascularization in a number of preclinical brain tumor models [45–47]. We found that beta 1 integrin (Itgb1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (Timp1) expression was significantly reduced when animals were maintained on KC. Beta1 integrin has been implicated in tumorigenesis, therapy resistance, invasion and metastasis [48]. Inhibitors of Itgb1are being explored as a treatment for various cancers and have been shown to potentiate antiangiogenic therapy in bevacizumab resistant glioblastoma [49].",1ef909b6-78bb-4c55-9310-0bfd0895f754
32,discussion9," In addition, low expression levels of TIMP-1 have been associated with longer survival times in Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients [50]. Recently TIMP-1 upregulation has also been shown to be involved in mechanisms of developed resistance to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment [51]. These results taken together suggest a potential utility of the KD as an adjuvant treatment for brain tumors and highlight the importance of metabolism in tumor progression.  The use of metabolism as a therapeutic target is not new. In 1914, Payton Rous first suggested that restricted food intake reduced tumor growth by reducing the tumor blood supply [52], and early attempts to use metabolism as a therapeutic target often focused on caloric restriction (CR). The combination of CR and the KD (restricted ketogenic diet; RKD) is also being explored as a cancer therapy.",ad5ab9d0-ab3c-433a-914a-8fa68751b833
33,discussion10," Both mouse and human xenograft models have been used to substantiate the anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic effects of CR and the RKD [53]. Evidence also suggests that CR and the RKD have similar anti-tumor mechanisms to the unrestricted KD Including the alteration of pathways involving with inflammation, normalization of vasculature and peritumoral edema. In a mouse astrocytoma model, CR reduced expression of pro-inflammatory markers, cyclooxygenase-2, NF-κB and macrophage inflammatory protein [13]. Seyfried and colleagues recently used the CT-2A mouse astrocytoma model to show that CR caused a reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and promoted vessel maturation, presumably by preventing the association of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β [54].",f5d57cb8-c0dd-4569-99a8-fb795587c8b7
34,discussion11," Further, a recent study using CR in a U87 human glioma xenograft model showed a reduction of peritumoral edema and normalization of a variety of factors involved in tumor vessel instability and leakiness, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression [55]. While CR and RKD can easily be administered in animal models of malignant tumors and there is anecdotal evidence and a few case reports of efficacy in humans, there has been resistance in the medical community to use CR for cancer patients. An alternative strategy is the KD without caloric restriction as used for the treatment of refractory pediatric epilepsy. This approach may meet less resistance in the clinic, as it has a long safety record and may be easier for patients to maintain [56].",a6429625-1b21-462c-bae1-25db3e65239e
35,discussion12," Interestingly, Zhou and colleagues found a trend toward increased survival when administering an unrestricted KD (unrestricted KD (UKD)) in a CT2A mouse astrocytoma model [57], however the results weren’t statistically significant. The authors observed no change in glucose and relatively low βHB levels with the unrestricted KD (UKD) when compared to the data presented above, which may explain the discrepancy. Zhou’s data and the current study highlight the importance of identifying an optimal therapeutic window for βHB and glucose as well as determining which tumor types and subtypes are likely to respond better to the KD.",90a1715c-d543-4203-9277-03fc181bd318
36,discussion13,"  The mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor benefits of the ketogenic diet, caloric restriction (and intermittent fasting) and other potential metabolic therapies have not yet been fully elucidated; however, preclinical data strongly suggests that metabolic alteration may be a highly effective therapy and may in fact enhance the current standard of care for malignant gliomas. The KD and/or CR are the only therapeutic approaches that simultaneously target multiple hallmarks of cancer such as energy metabolism, inflammation, hypoxia, angiogenesis and invasion. It is not clear whether the KD directly causes all of these changes in the tumor, or if some may be a result of changes in the tumor and/or tumor microenvironment that results from the KD. Indeed, a number of the effects seen such as reduction in peritumoral edema, alterations in hypoxia, etc are known to affect a number of downstream targets.",034d09fd-ad87-453e-966e-a37b686e7a39
37,discussion14," Whether the specific changes are directly or indirectly due to the KD, it is clear that the overall result has powerful anti-tumor effects in our preclinical model of glioma. This not only highlights the interconnectedness of metabolism with other aspects of tumor growth and progression, but suggests a potential utility for the KD in the treatment of malignant brain tumors.
