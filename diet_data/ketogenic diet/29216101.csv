0,introduction0,"The human gut microbiota has received increasing attention in recent years and numerous studies have demonstrated its role in health and disease. Dysbiosis, disturbances in the gut microbiome, has been linked to neurological disorders, such as autism,1 anxiety, and depression2 via the “microbiome–gut–brain axis.”3 This axis is a bidirectional communication system between the intestinal microbiome and the central nervous system involving neural, endocrine, and immune pathways.4 As evidence of this, germ-free mice display deficits in brain development and behavior.5  Diet influences the composition of the human gut microbiome.6 Based on the anti-seizure effect of fasting, the ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat, adequate-protein, very low-carbohydrate diet, was developed in the early 1920s7 to mirror the key metabolic effects of fasting.",6843c307-34b8-4532-aecd-1cb5b71d5606
1,introduction1," A diet very high in fat and low in carbohydrates induces multiple changes in the intermediary metabolism and results in the use of ketones as the main energy substrate. In children, KD is used in the treatment of therapy-resistant epilepsy and in neurometabolic disorders where glucose is not fully available as an energy substrate such as glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) deficiency syndrome and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. A seizure reduction of >50% has been found in about half of the treated children.8,9  Today, the classic KD is calculated with a ratio between 2:1 and 4:1 of fat to protein and carbohydrates combined. The ratio 4:1 contains 4 parts of fat and 1 part of proteins and carbohydrates together (in g). With a 4:1 ratio, 70–90% of energy intake is derived from fat. Despite a long history of clinical use, the mechanisms underlying the seizure-suppressive action are unclear.",06b1b239-c1ca-4a52-9078-50594d736e22
2,introduction2," Several hypotheses have been proposed including changes in neurotransmitter systems, inhibitory action of polyunsaturated fatty acids, or enhancement of mitochondrial function.10 Different aspects of human metabolism may be implicated, but little is known about how KD influences our “second genome,” the microbiome. In the present study, we examine how the fecal microbiome is affected by KD in children with epilepsy.  Here we have analyzed both taxonomic composition and functional profiles, i.e., gene content and pathway abundances in the gut microbiome during KD in children with therapy-resistant epilepsy using shotgun metagenomic sequencing.

3,methods0,"Patient cohort The present study was performed at the Neuropediatric Department, Astrid Lindgren Children’s Hospital, Karolinska Hospital. The patients were enrolled consecutively as they attended the Neuropediatric Outpatient Clinic and a decision was made to start KD. The inclusion criteria were: age 2–17 years; therapy-resistant inoperable epilepsy or a diagnosis of a neurometabolic disorder in which KD is recommended, no medical contraindications to a trial with KD, and consent for fecal sampling. Exclusion criteria were antibiotics taken within 3 months before starting KD.  The cohort included 12 children starting KD. Eleven suffered from therapy-resistant epilepsy and one had a neurometabolic disorder, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. The latter patient also had epilepsy but seizures were infrequent. For demographics, see Table 1. Four were males and eight females. Their age at diet start were 7.7 ± 4.5 (mean ± SD) years. The mean age at seizure start was 2.1 ± 2.",2e26abe6-50b3-4009-8905-6ff8f819e5b5
4,methods1,"1 (mean ± SD) years, (range 0.1–5.8). The types of seizures were classified according to the revised terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy classifications.60 The majority of children had more than one seizure type. Etiology could be determined in eight cases. In four patients, genetic mutations had been verified. The cohort had previously been on treatment with a mean of 5.7 ± 2.3 (mean ± SD) anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), range 1–9. At the time of KD start, the children were all on daily AED treatment. They were treated with mean 1.8 ± 0.8 (±SD), range 1–3 AEDs at diet start. At 3 months on KD, when follow-up of efficacy and second sampling of fecal microbiota was made, all had the same AEDs and dosing as before diet start except for two patients. One had tapered lacosamid soon after diet start (a non-responder) and the other had a slight increase in clobazam dose (a non-responder).",02942628-1dfd-4193-bdee-b653d94275ce
5,methods2," Eleven children had been investigated with neuropsychological formal testing methods concerning intellectual ability. Nine patients were diagnosed with intellectual disability (ID) ranging from mild to severe. One child was found to have learning disability and attention problems but no diagnosis was made, one child was late in development and not yet tested, and one child was clinically not found to have any deficits. Other comorbidities as autism spectrum disorder, attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder, and cerebral palsy were also common. Nine patients were fed orally and three patients had a gastrostomy.  Parents of the children included in the cohort acted as controls (one parent per child). The controls had a normal dietary intake with a western diet and no one had any specific diets. They did not make any substantial changes in their diet during the study period.",08c6d156-ff85-4e71-aa3a-3e89205d8137
6,methods3,"  Study design Seizure frequency was determined from seizure calendars in which parents and other caregivers made daily notes of the number and type(s) of seizures. They made notes during the month before KD and during KD. Calculations of these notes were used to define seizure response. Mean seizure frequency the month before starting KD was compared with mean seizure frequency the month before follow-up. Children with <50% seizure reduction were classified as non-responders and those with >50% seizure reduction as responders. Evaluation of cognitive and motor function was based on observations made by the parents and caregivers. They answered a questionnaire before diet start and at 3-month follow-up concerning the level of their child’s alertness, social interest and interaction, verbal responsiveness, ability to communicate, and motor function. Cognitive and motor function was considered improved if clear positive changes were experienced.",9b54e8aa-55a8-4ac1-9e1d-aa0b54cf7d4d
7,methods4,"  We followed a standardized protocol for the classic KD, which is a slightly modified version of the protocol of the Johns Hopkins Hospital.61 A dietitian specially trained to carry out KD treatment calculated total calorie level per day and composition of meals and supplements for each individual. These calculations were based on a 2-day diary kept by the parents before admission in which they recorded all food consumed by the child as well as discussions with the parents on the child’s food preferences. We did not use fasting or calorie restriction. A minimum of 1 g/kg body weight per day of protein was used. The children were supplemented with multivitamins and minerals, including potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, selenium, and carnitine. Potassium citrate was used to reduce the risk of kidney stones.  KD was started on a ratio of 2:1. This ratio was increased weekly in half steps, i.e., after 1 week of 2:1, it was increased to 2.5:1.",090dc0ee-8d47-4531-aae4-8dc72c20dc76
8,methods5," Usually an optimal ratio for the individual was reached in 3–6 weeks. This ratio was kept unchanged until 3 months after start when KD was evaluated concerning efficacy and the second fecal sample was taken.  To initiate the treatment, the child was hospitalized for 4 days. Before starting KD, a venous blood sample was obtained in the first morning before breakfast for analyses of glucose and the ketone β-hydroxybutyric acid. Fecal samples were obtained by a swab from the diaper or toilet paper. During the stay, KD was introduced and controlled by clinical examinations and daily blood levels of glucose, β-OHB, and acid–base balance. Keto diet school to teach parents, relatives, and caregivers on various aspects of the diet was carried out. After discharge, blood was sampled to monitor blood ketones, glucose, and acid–base balance at every increase in ratio and at 3 months on KD.",d41d51ef-c016-4a79-91cd-b02c843f3bf7

Written informed consent was obtained from the legal guardians of the children and, when possible, the children themselves. This research was conducted in accordance with all relevant guidelines and procedures.  Sample collection, transport, and storage Fecal sampling was done by the parents using a sterile FLOQSwab™ (Copan). The first sample was taken during the day before starting KD or in the morning of the day of starting. The second sampling at 3 months on diet was collected at home and the swabs were kept in a refrigerator for a few hours until transported to the hospital on ice where all samples were stored at −70 °C.

An aliquot of 50 µl was incubated with 10 ng PureLink RNase A (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, 5.1 µl sodium acetate (3 M, pH 6.8) and 102 µl isopropanol were added. After 10-min incubation on ice, the DNA was pelleted and washed in ethanol (70% v/v), centrifuged, and dried at room temperature. Finally, purified DNA was re-dissolved in 50 µl RNase-free water and stored at −80 °C.

MetaPhlAn2 and mOTU were run with default settings. In kaiju, we used the proGenomes reference database for classification in Greedy run mode with -a greedy -e 3 allowing for maximum three mismatches. RTG was run using the default composition-meta-pipeline.  For functional profiling, we applied SUPERFOCUS (SF)69 to align our reads against a reduced SEED database70 using DIAMOND71 and default values.  Alpha diversity was calculated on taxonomic mOTU counts using Qiime v1.9.1 and plotted in R (v.3.4.3 GUI 1.70 El Capitan build).

14,methods11," To analyze beta diversity of both taxonomic and functional profiles, we performed Principal component analysis (PCA) in R. Barplots at the phylum level were produced using RColorBrewer and rafalib libraries. LEfSe was used for statistical analysis at all the taxa level and SEED subsystem level 3. Pearson’s product–moment correlation coefficient was calculated in R to test for association between age of the patients and alpha diversities or RPKM values of genes of butyrate production pathways. Functional shift decomposition was performed using FishTaco,72 a permutation-based method to estimate taxonomic contributions to functional shifts using Shapley value analysis. Shifts were decomposed at the genus level with genomic content inferred from the MetaPhlAn2 taxonomic profiles and SF functional profiles.

However, the difference in diversity between the two time points was not significant in either patients or controls. Thus introduction of KD had little impact on the patients’ total gut microbial diversity. A slight correlation between alpha diversity values and age of the patients at time point one was detected (Fig. 1b). This was only significant for Chao1 (p = 0.044, r2 = 0.345).

Nineteen discriminative features at various taxonomic levels were detected (Fig. 3a). At the phylum level, relative abundance of Actinobacteria was significantly diminished and Proteobacteria increased proportionally 3 months after starting KD.

This analysis suggested that the decrease in Bifidobacterium relative abundance and increase in Escherichia relative abundance both contribute to the decreased relative abundance of multiple pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism pathways (Fig. 4a). In contrast, increases in pathway relative abundance was predicted to be more genus specific. For example, the increase in both Escherichia and Bacteroides relative abundances was inferred to be a potential driver of the increase in the Hemin transport system pathway, a function that has indeed been previously observed in both Escherichia13–15 and Bacteroides16–18 species.",b98bf991-1fc1-47d8-8f0e-caa4c1a9b91e

This subsystem contains genes encoding fumarate reductase subunits. According to the KEGG19 database annotation of the Eggerthella lenta genome, it encodes three sequences related to fumarate reductase subunits.Fig. 4 Taxonomic drivers of functional shifts associated with KD. Taxonomic contributions to the shift in each function are shown as bars for functions enriched pre-KD compared to post-KD a and functions enriched post-KD compared to pre-KD b.

36,results19," rectale, a major butyrate-producing species in the human gut, significantly decreased proportionally in patients during KD. To analyze whether this might impact the total butyrate synthesis potential of the whole community, a bacterial butyrate synthesis gene database20 was used to identify reads from genes involved in butyrate production in our shotgun metagenomic dataset. RPKM (reads per kilo base per million) values were calculated for all genes of the known microbial butyrate production pathways upstream of bcd/etfAB (butanoyl-CoA dehydrogenase, E.C.: 1.3.1.109), as there are downstream overlaps between pathways. gcdB of the glutarate pathway was excluded owing to recruitment of many false positives.21 Four butyrate-producing pathways are currently identified in human gut microbial communities20; the acetyl-CoA, the glutarate, the 4-aminobutyrate, and the lysine pathway.",50820b7d-250f-4341-87d5-77fbe1a252a5
37,results20," KD intervention did not have any overall significant impact on the relative abundance of any of these pathways (Fig. 5 a, b and Fig. Supplementary Figure 2 a, b). Interestingly though, we found that genes from the most abundant butyrate-producing pathway in the healthy human gut microbiome, the acetyl-CoA pathway, were less abundant in our patients compared to controls already before starting KD. Here a very weak but inverse correlation was detected between age of the patients and relative gene abundance indicating that the lower relative abundance of genes of the acetyl-CoA pathway in our patients (Fig. 5c) compared to our controls before KD was not due to the age difference between both groups. Rather, increasing age in our patients might increase the difference to the controls. An opposite trend was shown for the 4-aminobutyrate pathway (Fig. 5d). This pathway was shown to be less relative abundant in the healthy gut microbiome compared to the acetyl-CoA pathway.",848b0e76-8978-4c57-a238-43c1c3a90e71
38,results21,"20 In our cohort, genes of this pathway were more frequently identified in patients compared to controls before KD and a possible, yet not significant, further proportional increase was experienced during KD. Relative gene abundance seemed to slightly increase with age of the patients, indicating that this observation cannot be explained by age differences in the patient and control groups either. The lysine pathway did not show any significant differences in relative gene abundances within or between the groups at either time point (Supplementary Figure 2a). In the glutarate pathway, the relative abundance of one out of the six genes (hgCoAdA) was significantly decreased in the patients (Supplementary Figure 2b). However, the relative abundance of the concomitant enzymatic subunits hgCoAdB and hgCoAdC or other genes involved in this pathway was not decreased. It therefore seems unlikely that the glutarate pathway relative abundance is significantly different in any group of samples.",a32e36c0-ea80-4ce5-bd19-6233066dd106

41,discussion0,KD has been used successfully as an alternative treatment for therapy-resistant epilepsy since the 1920s. About half of the patients respond to the diet with at least 50% seizure reduction. There have been a number of studies trying to elucidate the mechanisms of action of KD. Evidence for the involvement of the microbiome in seizure susceptibility and KD treatment has recently been presented in animal models. KD demonstrated anti-seizure efficacy in two epilepsy mouse models but not when the mice were raised germ-free.22 Seizure susceptibility could be transferred by fecal microbial transplants (FMTs) in rats.23 This finding was supported by a single case study where a patient became seizure-free for at least 20 months after an FMT for Crohn’s disease.24  We studied taxonomic and functional changes in the fecal microbiome of epilepsy patients treated with KD. Twelve children followed the strict classic KD with a ratio of 3:1 to 4:1.,b0a1d775-f8b8-492f-a4db-354afc9b5dce
42,discussion1, Fecal samples from patients were obtained before and 3 months after starting KD. Eleven healthy parents were sampled at the same time points but did not start KD serving as controls. Whole metagenomic sequencing revealed taxonomic and functional shifts due to KD. The relative abundance of the genus Bifidobacterium was significantly decreased in patients after 3 months on KD. The species B. longum and B. adolescentis were significantly reduced but a similar trend was also observed for other bifidobacteria such as B. bifidum and B. catenulatum (data not shown).  Bifidobacteria are common to the healthy human gastrointestinal tract. They metabolize complex carbohydrates and possess one of the largest predicted glycobiomes25 including genes encoding for a specific hexose fermentation pathway called fructose-6-phosphate shunt or “bifid” shunt.,6813258e-a5d9-4e3f-af61-99022404505b
43,discussion2,"26 This pathway is superior in the energy output produced to pathways used by other fermentative gut bacteria and provides a growth advantage for bifidobacteria in the presence of complex carbohydrates. These facts may explain the concomitant proportional decrease of bifidobacteria and genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism during KD.  Duncan et al.27 supports our findings of diminished relative abundance of bifidobacteria and E. rectale in a low carbohydrate diet as well as our hypothesis that this may result in lower production of acetate and lactate. Acetate and lactate are products of the bifid shunt. Both acids contribute to a decreased pH in the gut, which may prevent pathogen growth. More specifically, Fukuda et al. has shown that bifidobacteria can protect mice from infection by enteropathogenic E. coli O157:H7 through production of acetate.28 In our study, we show that bifidobacteria relative abundance decreases during KD and E. coli relative abundance increases.",02804319-919b-4aa5-9abd-af702a727fc0
44,discussion3," This may, at least partly, be due to a decreased acetate production by Bifidobacterium and/or an increased luminal pH. Agus et al. demonstrated that a Western diet rich in both high fat and high sugar increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in mice that correlated with intestinal inflammation and increased susceptibility to adherent-invasive E. coli infection.29 E. coli is a versatile species comprising both commensal and pathogenic strains and can consume carbohydrates from a variety of sources through cross-feeding, including dietary fiber but also shed epithelial cells, and mucosal polysaccharides degraded by intestinal anaerobes.30 E. coli is associated with a variety of chronic intestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)).31 Therefore, the expansion of E. coli during KD might be of concern for general gut health in our patients.  Acetate can be consumed by butyrate-producing gut bacteria. Riviére et al.",6defde9f-521a-4131-92d7-cda5e4e75d81
45,discussion4,"32 demonstrated mutual cross-feeding between B. longum and E. rectale. This may contribute to the concomitant decrease of E. rectale relative abundance in our dataset. The reduced consumption of certain carbohydrates (resistant starch or wheat bran) may also have had a direct effect on the proportional decrease of E. rectale.33,34 A consequence of the depletion of Bifidobacterium and E. rectale may be a decreased production of short chain fatty acids (short chain fatty acids (SCFA)), specifically acetate in the bifid shunt and butyrate by E. rectale. short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are important for overall health and low fecal amounts have been associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)35 and advanced colorectal adenoma.36 Both acetate and butyrate have been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity.37–42 In addition, butyrate has a direct effect on gut health, being an essential energy source for colonocytes and increasing the intestinal barrier function.",fcbe716b-a0e4-4cde-8906-4eca901cc064
46,discussion5,"43,44 In our dataset, the relative abundance of E. rectale was rather low in the patients before starting the diet but further decreased during KD. However, the butyrate-producing community is a taxonomically diverse functional group.20  Based on our results, we hypothesize that, before starting KD, our epilepsy patients may have a different butyrate production profile than our controls, salvaging relatively more butyrate from the 4-aminobutyrate pathway and less from the acetyl-CoA pathway. This difference may be augmented during KD. Whether epilepsy patients have lower butyrate production in general is not possible to conclude from our dataset. A larger cohort in whom the actual metabolite butyrate is measured will provide more insight into this intriguing finding.",af322735-3a51-463f-a364-592e2a4e988d
47,discussion6,"  Other studies have recently investigated purely taxonomic changes upon KD treatment of children with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome or epilepsy by either real-time qPCR of selected microbial taxa45 or 16S rRNA gene sequencing46,47 with inconsistent results. While Tagliabue et al. detect a significant increase in Desulfovibrio spp. during KD in an Italian population, their conclusion concurs with ours—a concern about detrimental effects of KD on gut health. They identify a potential need for recommendations on probiotic or prebiotic supplementation. Interestingly, probiotic treatment lead to a >50% reduction in the number of seizures in 28.9% of epilepsy patients in a recent study.48 In agreement with Zhang et al., we detect a decrease in alpha diversity and relative abundance of Actinobacteria due to KD but they do not find a proportional increase in E. coli in their Chinese cohort.  In our cohort, 5 patients (41.7%) responded with >50% decrease in the number of seizures.",7f25f77e-8656-42b3-910a-4ee83dba61af
48,discussion7," However, in 10 children (83.3%) improved cognition and motor functions were observed. Interestingly, Ma et al. showed in mice that KD enhanced neurovascular functions including cerebral blood flow, which may influence cognitive capability.49 So far, it is unclear whether this can be observed in humans.  A strength of the present study is the investigation of both taxonomic and functional changes in the gut microbiota during KD. However, we are aware of some weaknesses of our study. Owing to the small size of this pilot cohort (12 patients and 11 controls), we are continuing to recruit patients for a larger study, in which we aim to stratify responders from the non-responders to identify differences in their gut microbiota. Another weakness is the heterogeneity of this epilepsy cohort in which different etiologies were included, and in one third of patients, despite thorough investigations including genetics, a specific etiology could not be obtained.",f2a4316a-46ab-4041-8883-1bf55611cb14
49,discussion8," Also the study lacks age-matched controls. Enrollment of healthy children proved difficult, but parents of our patients, sharing the same household, agreed to participate. Even though none of the parents started KD for themselves, they may have changed their dietary habits to some extent, i.e., eating less sugar and more fat. This might explain the decrease in Actinobacteria relative abundance (Fig. 2c), which, however, was not statistically significant. Apart from that, the microbiome of the parents was more stable comparing time point one and two and none of the taxa or pathways found significantly changed owing to KD in patients were found in parents. Importantly, as we aimed to study the effect of KD on the gut microbiota we compare communities and function before versus 3 months after starting KD within the patient group.  Here we show that the fecal microbiome of children with epilepsy changes during KD.",952147ea-f3c3-4902-a4e2-cf7f63f52b18
50,discussion9," The compositional changes observed might not be favorable for gut or overall health based on the current understanding of the composition and role of a healthy gut microbiota. Taxa believed to be health promoting (bifidobacteria and E. rectale) decrease in relative abundance and with them their health-promoting metabolites. One hypothesis for the mechanism of action of KD is the restriction of glucose production from dietary carbohydrates and production of ketone bodies from fat as alternative energy sources. While simple dietary sugars highly abundant in a modern Western diet are readily absorbed in the small intestine and contribute to elevated blood glucose levels, complex, so-called non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) cannot be hydrolyzed by the human enzyme repertoire and reach the large intestine. Several studies have shown the important role of dietary fibers/NDCs as energy sources for gut microbes in order to maintain gut health.",16568691-20f0-4265-9e7a-67da7ab71c28
51,discussion10,"50–52 Thus supplementing patients on KD with such fibers might seem advisable. The prebiotics inulin, lactulose, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and galacto-oligosaccharides have been investigated in several human trials, and studies suggest that these carbohydrates preferentially increase bifidobacteria and decrease E. coli and enterococci.53 This might prevent undesired changes in the gut microbiota in our patients. However, we first need to understand the role that changes in the gut microbiota during KD play in its therapeutic effect. Olson et al.22 elegantly showed that a gut microbiota was necessary for the anti-seizure effect of KD in mice. Here, Akkermansia and Parabacteroides mediated this effect involving changes in systemic gammaglutamylated amino acids and elevated hippocampal GABA/glutamate levels.",09908c45-3f26-4b2e-b06f-436178f50cfc
52,discussion11," Identifying which microbial taxa and functions may be correlated to a positive effect of the diet in patients could lead to the development of probiotic supplements for non-responders to increase their chance of response to the intervention. Ideally, KD could even be replaced by the right combination of prebiotic and probiotic supplements or FMTs in the future. A larger cohort is needed to further investigate this. Additionally, while our cohort suffered from therapy-resistant epilepsy, KD has also been shown to be effective in many other diseases, such as cancer,54–56 multiple sclerosis,57 Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s,58 depression, autism, and type 2 diabetes.59 Thus our results may have implications for a wide range of serious health concerns.
