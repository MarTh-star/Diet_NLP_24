25,results0," mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-deficient cortical neurons display decreased pyruvate-mediated oxidative phosphorylation in vitro  To assess the role of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)) in neuronal oxidized through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), we first used primary cultures of cortical neurons largely depleted of astrocytes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) and either RNA interference or pharmacological reagents to downregulate their mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) activity. To this end, two different shRNAs targeting mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 and three different pharmacological inhibitors of the carrier, Zaprinast , Rosiglitazone , and UK5099 (Halestrap, 1975) were used.",0fc04929-b437-445c-9b5f-d63b238da8ac

We used the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling protocol described previously (Dhir, 2012), in which a sub-convulsant dose (35 mg/kg) of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) is injected intraperitoneally (ip) once every 2 days on a period of 15 days (Figure 3A).",266cefde-f647-4c80-8e80-c17f22f95b87

In contrast, all neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice developed severe, prolonged seizures (score 6) within 10 min of the first pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injection (Figure 3B) and all died during seizures within the next three pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injections (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).",62409de5-3996-4754-9e54-471e3c67df88

In a parallel series of experiments, and in order to assess the specificity of our results to excitatory neurons, we investigated the effects of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in mice in which mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 was deleted in adult astrocytes (hereafter termed astro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice) (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-E).",f240700d-c48b-4afc-94a0-ebde1cf15579

To characterize the seizure symptoms in more detail, we recorded the electrical activity in the brains of neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-WT and neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice by electroencephalogram (EEG) following a single injection of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (Figure 3C).

Such EEG patterns are characteristic of seizure episodes in humans and were not observed in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-injected neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-WT mice. These data indicate that neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice develop an epilepsy-like phenotype following administration of a single sub-convulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ).

Inhibition of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice by the ketogenic diet  The ketogenic diet (KD) has been reported to decrease seizures in patients with pharmacologically refractory epilepsy . Ketone bodies, mainly generated by the liver during fasting and hypoglycaemia, are used by neurons to provide the TCA cycle with acetyl-CoA, normally provided by pyruvate dehydrogenase-mediated oxidation of pyruvate. Thus, ketone bodies ensure that oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production is maintained in neurons in conditions of glucose starvation. We tested whether a ketogenic diet could prevent pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice. As previously reported (Wirrell et al.",53de896e-7cac-46ea-8f0a-debdaa1ab482
57,results32,", 2018), we found that the KD produces a decrease in glycaemia and an increase in the blood level of 3-β-hydroxy-butyrate (βHB), one of the three major ketone bodies generated by the liver (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B). In addition, we found that mice fed on the KD for 1 week were completely resistant to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injection (Figure 4A). Supplementing the drinking water with 1% βHB was sufficient to prevent pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures (Figure 4B). Similarly, ip administration of βHB (1 g/Kg) 15 min before pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injection, or starvation overnight, both of which conditions led to increased βHB blood levels (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-E), significantly reduced the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced clinical score of neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice (Figure 4B, C).",a6d23943-7291-4a23-9359-c899c3ec0d73
58,results33," Similarly, supplementing the drinking water with 1% acetoacetate, another type of ketone body, reduced pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-mice (Figure 4D). These results indicate that the phenotype displayed by the neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice is mainly metabolic in origin and is unlikely to be the consequence of neuronal network remodeling.

For these experiments, we first recorded action potential firing under control conditions, and then perfused the slices with βHB (2 mM, > 20 min exposure) . As shown in Figure 5, whereas cell firing was unaltered in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-WT cells (Figure 5E, F), βHB reduced excitability in pyramidal cells from the neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice (Figure 5G, H).",8b8599a2-caf8-4fd8-abea-fea7351e0eae

71,results46,"  mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-deficient neurons display altered M-type potassium channel activation, which is corrected by ß-hydroxybutyrate  To gain insight into the mechanisms governing neuronal hyperexcitability, we analysed the cellular passive properties and action potential characteristics of all recordings performed in cells from neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO and neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-WT mice (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-K). The reduction in rheobase and the shift in threshold potential induced by mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 deletion were accompanied by several changes in passive and active membrane properties governing cell excitability, including a significant increase in the input resistance (Ri) and in the voltage response to a depolarizing current injection (depolsub), along with a marginally significant reduction in HCN channel-mediated sag (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-I).",b537a203-08ee-4795-9c45-c4fe2d3ceca9
72,results47," The fast afterhyperpolarization (fAHP) accompanying action potentials was not altered, ruling out a major contribution of BK channels (Figure 5—figure supplement 1J). However, the medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP), measured as the negative peak of the voltage deflection at the offset of the depolarizing ramps was significantly reduced in cells from neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice (Figure 5—figure supplement 1K). In CA1 pyramidal cells, mAHP is primarily mediated by the activation KCNQ2/3 (Kv7.2 and Kv7.3) channels, which generate an M-type K+ conductance regulating intrinsic excitability and synaptic integration . Opening of these channels produces an outward potassium current that functions as a ‘brake’ for neurons receiving persistent excitatory input (Greene and Hoshi, 2017). Consistently, mutations in KCNQ2/3 genes have been associated with seizures in the mouse , as well as in patients (Jentsch et al.",c3f41379-2f36-4e0f-88bb-a9d2120fee14
73,results48,", 2000), pointing to these channels as interesting targets for anticonvulsant therapy . To test whether neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice displayed an altered contribution of the M-type K+ conductance, we tested the effect of the M-type channel blocker XE991 (10 µM) on CA1 pyramidal cell firing. XE991 led to a significant increase in firing frequency of neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-WT cells, whereas firing of neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO cells was not significantly modified (Figure 5I and J). Consistently, XE991 induced a significant reduction in the rheobase and a shift in the threshold potential in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-WT cells, but had no impact on neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO cells (Figure 5K and L), pointing to a limited activity of KCNQ2/3 channels in these neurons.",655ea203-d42a-4410-ae43-586ac83f1f3c
74,results49," Interestingly, bath application of βHB following KCNQ2/3 channel blockade with XE991 failed to reduce the hyperexcitability of neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice (Figure 5J–L). We also noticed that, in the absence of XE991, the reduction of intrinsic excitability by βHB in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-deficient neurons was accompanied by a significant increase in mAHP (Figure 5M, N), suggesting that βHB may potentiate the recruitment of the M-type K+ channels. Moreover, the M-type channel activator retigabine (10 µM) effectively decreased the hyperexcitability of pyramidal cells from neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice to a level that was no further affected by βHB (Figure 5O, P). This suggests that βHB and retigabine display a similar mechanism of action, which is consistent with recent findings showing that βHB can directly bind to and activate KCNQ2/3 channels .",3b4fbea0-d8b7-45b7-979b-a72c477d940a
75,results50,"  We finally tested whether the increased neuronal excitability in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice was also accompanied by alterations in glutamatergic transmission. In acute slices, we recorded field potentials in CA1 stratum radiatum elicited by electrical stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals (Figure 5—figure supplement 1L). No overt genotype differences were found in the input-output curves of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), and the lack of changes in paired-pulse ratio indicated no major alteration in the presynaptic release (Figure 5—figure supplement 1M, N).  Altogether, these results indicate that the hyperexcitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons from neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice is mediated by alterations in intrinsic cell excitability associated with a reduced M-type K+ channel activation, with no major changes in excitatory synaptic inputs.",5d6a1c23-abd4-406b-8db3-fc578d34e4ac
76,results51,"  Alteration of calcium homeostasis in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-deficient neurons  The conductance of KCNQ channels is regulated by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and calmodulin (CaM) (Alaimo and Villarroel, 2018; Gamper and Shapiro, 2003). In particular, reduction in free CaM in hippocampal neurons decreases M-current density and increases neuronal excitability . Thus, calcium could trigger loss of interaction of CaM and KCNQ2/3 channels, leading to M-type current suppression (Kosenko and Hoshi, 2013).  We tested whether disruption of calcium homeostasis could be responsible for the deficit in the M-type K+ channel activity displayed by mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-deficient neurons. We first assessed whether calcium homeostasis was perturbed in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-deficient cortical neurons in vitro.",b9e05d91-e6d6-4f15-8759-e78a184487d7

89,results64," Given that the mitochondrial membrane potential of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-deficient neurons was reduced (Figure 1C, F), we assessed whether the increased cytosolic calcium levels in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-deficient neurons could result from impaired calcium uptake by mitochondria, similar to what would be expected for reduced mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) activity. We monitored cytosolic calcium in cultured cortical neurons at rest or upon stimulation with 50 mM KCl, in the presence or absence of chemical inhibitors of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) activity was downregulated either using the pharmacological inhibitor RU360  or RNA interference (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A).",f9ba3ea3-08e6-4442-b43d-1b81bd7391c8
90,results65," These experiments showed that upon neuron depolarization with 50 mM KCl, the cytosolic calcium level was significantly higher in neurons in which mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) or mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) had been inactivated (Figure 6C–E; Figure 6—figure supplement 2B). The level of cytosolic calcium was not further increased when both mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and MCP were inactivated concomitantly (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B-D). These results confirmed that impairing the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), similar to inhibiting the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), resulted in increased cytosolic calcium levels in depolarized neurons.  To pursue our investigations further, we used two strategies to assess mitochondrial calcium: (i) an indirect approach consisting in measuring the difference in the signal emitted by the cytosolic calcium probe, before and after depolarization of mitochondria with fCCP.",3f069526-44f3-4263-918c-daa5bbc14a80
91,results66," Upon depolarization, mitochondria are expected to release their calcium content. (ii) a direct approach using the calcium luminescent probe aequorin targeted to mitochondria . As expected, fCCP-induced mitochondrial uncoupling resulted in an increased signal from the cytosolic calcium probe in control neurons and in neurons with inactive mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) or mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). However, the difference in signal intensity, before and after fCCP addition, was significantly attenutated in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and/or mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU)-deficient neurons compared to control (Figure 6D,F; Figure 6—figure supplement 2B-D). These results suggested a decreased storage of calcium in mitochondria from mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)- and mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU)-deficient neurons.",77f758e7-473a-4d60-ae70-12a3ffea2929
92,results67," The mitochondrial aequorin probe was then used to test whether this was the consequence of reduced intake of calcium by mitochondria from these neurons, upon activation. As expected, we found that upon neuronal depolarization with KCl, the chemiluminescence of aequorin increased significantly in control and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and/or mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) deficient neurons (Figure 6G). However, in cells lacking either mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) or mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) activity the aequorin signal was much lower compared to control and no additivity was found when both mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and MPU were inactivated together (Figure 6G). Taken together, these results show that the increased cytosolic calcium in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and/or mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU)-deficient neurons results, at least in part, from decreased import of calcium into mitochondria.",1522e336-48f1-46e6-8b87-26c45880c7ea
93,results68," The low mitochondrial membrane potential in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-deficient neurons most likely explains this result.  To further test whether the increased cytosolic calcium resulting from dysfunctional mitochondria was responsible for the hyperexcitability of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-deficient neurons, we performed electrophysiological recordings in CA1 pyramidal cells in the presence of RU360 into the patch pipette. In neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-WT cells, addition of 1 µM or 10 µM RU360 to the cell pipette caused an increase in cell firing (Figure 6H,I) while 10 µM RU360 had no effect in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO cells (Figure 6J,K).",6710a94a-4136-41d7-a1f6-30f39dca0959
94,results69," Importantly, blockade of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) with RU360 in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-WT cells was accompanied by a significant reduction in the mAHP (Figure 6L,M), indicating that calcium alterations induced by mitochondrial dysfunction may indeed affect M-type K+ channel activation. Finally, although βHB treatment did not significantly alter the firing of neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-WT cells in control conditions (Figure 5E,F), it reduced the excitability of cells infused with 10 µM RU360 while slightly increasing mAHP (Figure 6N,O), consistent with the hypothesis that βHB normalizes the alteration in the M-type K + conductance.",b1a3761b-4169-4a32-85e1-06696cba946c
95,results70,"  To further substantiate the hypothesis that higher cytosolic calcium impairs M-type K+ channel activity in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO cells, we performed patch-clamp experiments using an intracellular solution containing the calcium chelator Bis(2 aminophenoxy)ethane N N N′ N′ tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) (10 mM). We compared cell firing between the first minutes after the establishment of the whole-cell condition and 15 min thereafter, that is before and after complete diffusion of Bis(2 aminophenoxy)ethane N N N′ N′ tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) in the cytoplasm (Figure 6P–R). Whereas intrinsic excitability was unaltered in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-WT cells at these two timepoints, neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO cells displayed significantly lower firing rate and higher rheobase upon calcium chelation (Figure 6Q,R).",e19f2082-576e-4ec8-874a-e2032a021637
96,results71," Notably, unlike in Bis(2 aminophenoxy)ethane N N N′ N′ tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)-free recordings (Figure 5J,K,L), subsequent bath application of XE991 (10 µM) increased intrinsic excitability not only in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-WT cells, but also in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO cells, indicating that calcium chelation made available a contribution of M-type K+ channels that was otherwise impaired by the high intracellular calcium levels.  Altogether, our results show that mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-deficient neurons display a lower mitochondrial calcium buffering capacity which may explain the hypoactivity of the M-type K+ channel and the intrinsic hyperexcitability of neurons.

97,discussion0," Tight coupling between neuronal activity and energy metabolism is essential for normal brain function. Here, to assess the contribution of pyruvate metabolism in neuronal activity, we inactivated the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) specifically in adult CamKIIα-expressing neurons in the mouse. As previously reported , we found that loss of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) led to decreased oxygen consumption and ATP production in glutamatergic neurons. Despite this, these mice appeared normal at rest and presented a normal behavioral repertoire (i.e. novelty exploration, sociability, stress coping), except for lower anxiety-like behaviors which are consistent with a higher glutamatergic tone .",a332584d-c3d6-44b8-919f-7a4175fa1f70
98,discussion1," Most strinkingly, however, these mice developed severe seizures immediately following low-level administration of two pro-convulsant drugs, the glutamate and γ−aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazole (pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)), or the glutamate receptor agonist kainic acid.  The lack of an apparent phenotype in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice at rest suggests that, up to a certain point, mitochondria can compensate for the deficit in mitochondrial pyruvate import by using other substrates to fuel the TCA cycle. It seems unlikely that such a compensatory mechanism would involve β-oxidation of fatty acids since these neurons do not express the enzymes necessary for this process (Schönfeld and Reiser, 2013). Furthermore, it is unlikely that the astrocyte-neuron-shuttle, which supplies astrocyte-derived lactate to neurons to boost oxidized through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Mächler et al.",b59635f1-750c-40e4-bee9-1fb9bb944356
99,discussion2,", 2016), can circumvent the loss of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) since all available data thus far indicate that lactate must first be converted into pyruvate by neuronal LDH in order to fuel the TCA cycle. It has been recently reported that inactivation of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) in cultured neurons, using the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) small molecule inhibitor UK5099 , or mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 gene knockout in the developing retina specifically , resulted in a switch in mitochondrial substrate metabolism leading to increased reliance on glutamate  or in ketones  to fuel energetics and anaplerosis. Furthermore, inactivation of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) in cultured neurons also increased oxidation of the branched chain keto-acid catabolites of leucine, isoleucine, and valine .",134044a0-92a0-4a03-a4b9-e60baf0da223
100,discussion3," Whether oxidation of these substrates can circumvent decreased pyruvate oxidation to allow mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-deficient neurons to sustain normal function in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice at rest remains to be confirmed.  Despite the lack of an obvious phenotype in resting mice, we found that, when challenged with the pro-convulsant molecules pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) or kainic acid, the neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice were far more sensitive than WT animals and rapidly exhibited severe acute seizures. This suggests that the basal electrical activity of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-deficient neurons may be continuously counterbalanced by inhibitory synapses, providing the normal resting phenotype described above.",2267d819-3ef2-447b-b60a-10a8134eaabe
101,discussion4," However, upon release of the ‘brakes’ exerted by the inhibitory system, the neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO neurons would become hyperactive, which would translate into the observed epileptic output. Consistent with our data, mice deficient in pyruvate dehydrogenase (pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)), the enzyme acting immediately downstream of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), were found to display an epileptiform cortical activity accompanied by behaviorally observable seizures . In this case, the epileptiform activity occurred in the context of reduced background cortical activation and, as suggested by the authors, the most likely explanation was that seizures resulted from a combination of decreased activity of inhibitory neurons, mostly parvalbumin-expressing cortical neurons, with slightly overexcitable excitatory neurons.",206f0fbe-723a-451e-87b0-0a0d3cc68f63
102,discussion5," Similar to pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-deficient neurons, we found that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-deficient neurons displayed higher input resistance and increased spike frequency after stimulation, a phenotype that we investigated further and found to be mediated by an impairment of the medium component of the after-hyperpolarization potential mediated by an M-type K + conductance.  K+ efflux is the primary force behind the cellular repolarization that limits the spike after depolarization and thereby prevents neuronal hyperexcitability. One important class of K+ channels that fulfills this task is the M-current (IM)-generating KCNQ channel family (also called Kv7 channels) . In hippocampal neurons the IM is mediated by the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channels (Kv7.1 and Kv7.2), which form hetero or homodimers. Loss of function of KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 causes epilepsy in humans and mice (Biervert et al., 1998; Schroeder et al., 1998; Singh et al.",b08d2e2e-6aaa-44ed-8387-d3d4aface2f9
103,discussion6,", 2008; Watanabe et al., 2000). In support of the involvement of these channels in the intrinsic membrane hyperexcitability of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO neurons, we found that their inhibition, using the small molecule XE991, did not change the electrical properties of KO neurons, while it made WT neurons more excitable. Our results suggest that KCNQ2/3 channels are closed in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-deficient neurons, and that this could underlie their hyperexcitability.  Our observations point to dysregulation of calcium homeostasis as the cause for the silencing of these channels. High levels of cytosolic calcium have been reported to decrease KCNQ channel activity by detaching calmodulin from the channel or by inducing changes in the configuration of the calmodulin-KCNQ channel complex (Alaimo and Villarroel, 2018; Kosenko and Hoshi, 2013).",286651d9-b409-410a-8016-1cb90001de4b
104,discussion7," In our study, we report a significant increase of cytosolic calcium levels in cultured depolarized mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-deficient neurons due to an impaired capacity of mitochondria to import calcium. Accordingly, increasing cytosolic calcium levels in wild type neurons from acute hippocampal slices using the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) inhibitor RU360 was sufficient to increase their firing properties, while RU360 had no significant effect on the excitability of the neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO neurons.",1d093780-7a72-43c5-9ff0-8233f8e3d6c7
105,discussion8," Conversely, the intracellular calcium chelator Bis(2 aminophenoxy)ethane N N N′ N′ tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) decreased intrinsic excitability in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO neurons only and rendered them sensitive to XE991 blockade, suggesting that buffering the aberrant intracellular calcium levels was sufficient to reactivate the M-type K+ conductance and normalize the excitability of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1 deficient neurons. Altogether, these results argue in favour of mitochondrial-related calcium homeostasis dysregulation as the reason for the silencing of KCNQ2/3 channels in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO neurons.  The ketogenic diet has been reported to decrease seizures in patients with pharmacologically refractory epilepsy  and we now report that the hyperexcitability of neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice fed with ketones is significantly reduced.",e6bdc738-1609-44ec-9441-c3d07380e475
106,discussion9," Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain how ketone bodies could reduce neuron excitability, some involving direct pharmacological effects while others argue for an indirect role as metabolic fuels (Yellen, 2008). Beta-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) has been previously reported to display a direct pharmacological effect on the M-channel  and its protective action against proconvulsant drugs in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice could be at least explained by this mechanism. On the other hand, acetoacetate, which is unlikely to impact directly the M-channel, was as efficient as βHB in reducing pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice.",2ec53b0e-acd8-43b6-8963-5fa46be4e803
107,discussion10," This, together with the ability of βHB to restore oxygen consumption, ATP production, and mitochondrial membrane potential in cultured mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-deficient neurons, suggests that one of the main protective actions of ketone bodies in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice may be through provision of acetyl-CoA to the TCA cycle. However, additional mechanisms cannot be excluded. It has been previously reported that decreased glycolysis induced by ketones bodies can trigger activation of KATP channels, thereby making neurons less excitable (Giménez-Cassina et al., 2012; Yellen, 2008). In our study, we show that mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) inhibition leads to increased aerobic glycolysis, which can be reversed by βHB. Whether KATP channels are involved in the protection conferred by ketones in neuro-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)1-KO mice requires further investigations.",141b9495-a98f-4db0-86cd-28fd5944d899
108,discussion11,"  In conclusion, using mice carrying an inducible deletion of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) specifically in excitatory neurons, we have shown that, despite impaired pyruvate-mediated oxygen consumption and ATP production, glutamatergic neurons can sustain high firing and trigger severe behaviorally observable seizures when the glutamate and γ−aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic network is inhibited. Furthermore, our data provide an explanation for the paradoxical hyperactivity of excitatory neurons resulting from oxidized through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficits, which often accompanies neuropathologies such as cerebral ischemia or diverse mitochondriopathies, and identify KCNQ channels as interesting therapeutic targets to prevent seizures occurring in these pathologies.
