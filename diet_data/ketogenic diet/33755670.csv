0,methods0," Mice  16-week-old male B6D2/F1 hybrid mice were purchased from Jackson Labs (strain no. 100006). Mice were acclimated to the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health mouse facility for 2 weeks prior to experiments and were fed a standard chow diet during this acclimation period (Purina, 5053-PicoLab Rodent Diet 20). Mice were allowed ad libitum access to food and water unless otherwise noted. Mouse numbers were n = 4 per diet group for the GTT, insulin tolerance test (ITT), and insulin injection experiments, and a separate cohort of n = 6 per diet group for all other analyses, with 2 mice co-housed per cage. Mice were maintained at 22°C with 12-h light-dark cycles and 30–50% relative humidity. Mice were housed in a Specific Pathogen Free (Specific Pathogen Free (SPF)) facility, as determined by screening of sentinel animals at monthly intervals.

8,results0," Short-Term Dietary Protein or Carbohydrate Restriction Reduces Body Weight and Adiposity in Mice  In order to evaluate the contribution of protein restriction to the metabolic and molecular adaptations elicited by KD, mice were fed six distinct diets: Low-fat control containing 20% of energy from protein (containing 20% of energy from protein (CTL)) or 0% of energy from protein (PF), classical KD containing no carbohydrate and 10% energy from protein (KD10P), modified KD for which half or all protein content was replaced with carbohydrate (KD5P or KD0P), or KD with protein content normalized to the control diet (KD20P) (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figures 1A,B).  FIGURE 1 Short-term dietary protein or carbohydrate restriction alters body composition. Male B6D2F1 mice were fed one of six diets for 8 days (n = 6 per diet) with varying macronutrient compositions as depicted in (A).

10,results2," All experimental diets resulted in significant weight loss compared to mice fed the containing 20% of energy from protein (CTL) diet, with KD0P resulting in the greatest magnitude of weight loss (Figure 1B). A similar degree of weight loss was observed following PF and KD10P diets. All diets tended to have a lower energy intake vs. control, but only KD0P had a statistically significant decrease compared to control (Figure 1C). Weight loss was primarily attributed to significant reductions in fat mass, which was observed in all diet groups, except KD20P (Figure 1D). However, significant reductions in lean mass were also observed in PF and KD0P groups (Figure 1E). Liver weight was also reduced following all experimental diets, with KD0P and KD5P groups significantly different from containing 20% of energy from protein (CTL) mice (Figure 1F).",93664739-fba3-4223-9b91-fdab66706343
11,results3,"  Protein-Free Diet Improves Insulin Tolerance Compared to Ketogenic Diet Following Short-Term Feeding  To evaluate the metabolic effects of short-term protein or carbohydrate restriction, markers of systemic glucose homeostasis were assessed. Mice fed PF and KD diets, except for KD20P, had significantly lower fasting blood glucose and serum insulin after 1 week (Figures 2A,B). KDs with 0–10% of energy from protein resulted in elevated fasting ketone levels, which was blunted by the addition of protein to 20% of energy (KD20P) (Figure 2C). Increased ketone levels were not observed in mice fed PF.  FIGURE 2 Protein-free, but not ketogenic, diet improves insulin sensitivity following short-term feeding.

13,results5," Different letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05) between groups, with common letters indicating no significant difference. Values are represented as mean ± SD.  Glucose and insulin tolerance were further assessed in a separate cohort of mice fed containing 20% of energy from protein (CTL), PF, or KD10P diets (n = 4 per diet). Neither PF nor KD10P diets significantly affected glucose tolerance (Figures 2D,E and Supplementary Figures 2A,B). Serum insulin concentrations during the GTT were significantly lower in both PF- and KD-fed mice (Figures 2F,G), suggesting that mice fed PF and KD10P require less insulin to clear exogenous glucose. However, PF-fed mice demonstrated significantly greater insulin tolerance compared to KD mice (Figures 2H,I and Supplementary Figures 2C,D).",30b77581-bbbb-456f-bea8-d2bf963d0990
14,results6,"  To evaluate whether PF or KD10P diets enhanced the hepatic response to insulin, insulin/Akt signaling was assessed in liver tissue following intraperitoneal insulin injection (n = 2 vehicle, 2 insulin per diet). Liver Akt activation, indicated by phosphorylation of Akt and its target FoxO1, was induced in response to insulin in all mice regardless of diet. While conclusions are limited by the small sample size of this experiment, insulin-induced Akt activation appeared to be enhanced in PF compared to KD10P mice (Figure 2J and Supplementary Figures 2E,F).  Protein-Free, but Not Ketogenic, Diets Induce Molecular Markers of Dietary Protein Restriction  Next, we aimed to determine whether ketogenic diets induce established markers of protein restriction, including serum FGF21 levels, hepatic Fgf21 and Asns mRNA expression and brown adipose tissue (brown adipose tissue (BAT)) Ucp1 mRNA expression.",c8258547-8070-4a03-9697-e1a8acaddd3e
15,results7," Serum FGF21 was increased ∼5-fold in mice fed either protein-free diets, PF or KD0P, compared to containing 20% of energy from protein (CTL) mice (Figure 3A). Serum FGF21 was also significantly increased in mice fed KD5P, but to a lesser extent, and was not increased in mice fed either KD10P or KD20P, compared to containing 20% of energy from protein (CTL) mice.  FIGURE 3 Protein-free, but not ketogenic, diets induce molecular markers of dietary protein restriction. (A) Serum FGF21 was measured in 6-h fasted mice fed experimental diets for 8 days. Liver gene expression of Fgf21 (B) and Asns (C) and brown adipose tissue expression of Ucp1 (D) were measured by RT-qPCR and normalized to actin expression. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Different letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05) between groups, with common letters indicating no significant difference. Values are represented as mean ± SD.",f4f4a82e-d826-488b-80b9-749c0bf00b80
16,results8,"  The adaptation to dietary protein restriction includes upregulation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) gene targets Fgf21 and Asns in the liver, as well as upregulation of Ucp1 expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Next, we compared the induction of these gene signatures by PF and KD diets. As expected, liver Fgf21 and Asns expression was elevated in mice fed PF (Figures 3B,C). However, neither Fgf21 nor Asns expression was increased in the liver of mice fed KDs containing at least 5% protein (Figures 3B,C). In agreement with previous reports, brown adipose tissue (BAT) Ucp1 expression was significantly elevated in mice fed PF compared to those fed containing 20% of energy from protein (CTL) (∼5-fold, Figure 3D). While brown adipose tissue (BAT) Ucp1 expression was slightly increased in mice fed either of the KD diets compared to those fed the containing 20% of energy from protein (CTL) diet, none of these differences were significant.",fbdb783f-1606-4af7-bdc1-fd60ed75f323
17,results9," Interestingly, although mice fed the protein-free KD, KD0P, demonstrated significantly greater elevations in hepatic Fgf21 (∼2-fold difference) and Asns expression (∼4-fold difference) compared to mice fed the carbohydrate-rich PF diet, they showed only equivalent or less circulating FGF21 and brown adipose tissue (BAT) Ucp1 expression (Figures 3A–D).  Protein-Free and Ketogenic Diets Produce Distinct Hepatic Transcriptomic Signatures  To further explore changes in hepatic gene expression as a function of diet, we performed RNA sequencing. Data reduction by multidimensional scaling showed distinct clustering of samples by group with KD20P showing the least divergence from containing 20% of energy from protein (CTL) and KD0P showing the greatest divergence (Figure 4A). Key genes in the amino acid restriction response showed a greater relative increase in KD0P vs. PF, and no response in KD10P, including Fgf21, Asns, and Psat1 (Figures 4B–D).",b0f19cce-35b3-41eb-b55f-438a0b46d9ea
18,results10," Interestingly, although Atf4 expression was similarly elevated in KD0P compared to PF livers, it also tended to increase across the other KD groups (Supplementary Figure 3A), suggesting it may not be a key driver of this response. When weighted gene correlation network analysis (weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA)) was performed, a single module containing these three genes (Fgf21, Psat1, and Asns) was identified. This module contained 51 genes which exhibited similar behavior across groups including a proportionally greater increase in KD0P vs. PF (Supplementary Figure 3B). Several other genes characteristic of the amino acid stress response were identified in this module including tRNA synthetases (Yars, Cars, Mars, Farsa, and Rars), Pck2 and Mthfd2. When transcription factor (TF) binding site analysis was performed, binding motifs for Ventx, Thap11, Atf4, and Sox21 were the top enriched hits compared to a background list of 1000 random genes (Supplementary Figure 3C).",f13557cd-33c1-43ff-82b2-807c987fd687

20,results12," LP enriched includes TF binding motifs which are significantly depleted in cluster 1 and significantly enriched in cluster 2. The same method was used for KD in clusters 3 and 4 and high fat (HF) in clusters 5 and 6.  To better understand how gene networks change in response to the experimental diets, unsupervised clustering of the most variable 10% of genes in the dataset was performed. Six major clusters were identified from this analysis (Figure 4E). Clusters 1 and 2 responded to dietary protein content by linearly increasing or decreasing, respectively. Clusters 3 and 4 were either increased or decreased, respectively by the classic ketogenic diet (KD10P). Clusters 5 and 6 were comprised of genes which increased or decreased, respectively as a function of increased dietary fat content, largely independent of ketosis.",98edeef0-87d1-4719-b9d6-e89ed458cebc
21,results13,"  Gene set overrepresentation analysis showed that the genes linearly responding to protein content were largely involved in amino acid metabolic processes, fatty acid metabolism and CoA metabolic processes (Figure 4F). Cluster 3 (increasing with classic KD) was enriched for genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, lipid catabolism and nucleotide metabolic processes, which were not observed in the protein responsive clusters. There was some overlap between clusters 1 and 3 regarding amino acid catabolic processes. The pathways increased in response to increased dietary fat content (cluster 5) were primarily involved in lipid metabolism and CYP regulation. Interestingly, pathways enriched in genes that decreased in response to dietary fat tended to overlap with those that were increased in response to classic KD, particularly those involving nucleotide metabolism.",33eacd31-a220-4306-93e9-dc65f09a6c8a
22,results14,"  To investigate TFs that may be regulating these differential responses to diet, binding site motif analysis was performed across the clusters. To determine TFs that may be enriched in response to low protein, the overlap of TFs significantly depleted in cluster 1 and significantly enriched in cluster 2 was taken. A similar approach was taken to identify TFs enriched by KD using clusters 3 and 4, and TFs enriched by high fat using clusters 5 and 6. In the low protein condition, motifs for Atf1, Ahr:Arnt and E2F6 binding were among the most enriched (Figure 4G and Supplementary Figures 3D,E). In the KD condition, binding sites for FOS and JUN family proteins were highly enriched including Fos, Fosb, Fosl1, and Fosl2 (Figure 4G and Supplementary Figures 3F,G). In the high fat condition, binding motifs for HOX and SOX family proteins were significantly enriched, independent of ketogenesis (Figure 4G and Supplementary Figures 4H,I).

23,discussion0," This study utilized six distinct diets to dissect the influence of protein content on the short-term metabolic adaptations to the high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet. After 8 days, the high-carbohydrate protein-free diet (PF) and three ketogenic diets (KDs) with 0, 5, or 10% energy from protein resulted in weight loss, which was primarily attributed to loss of fat mass, and reduced fasting blood glucose and insulin levels. Despite similar physiological effects of KD and PF diets, the diets differed with respect to some metabolic and molecular markers. Mice fed PF demonstrated significantly greater insulin tolerance than mice fed KD10P. With the exception of the protein-free KD (KD0P), KD diets did not lead to elevations in serum or tissue markers of protein restriction, including circulating FGF21, hepatic Fgf21 and Asns and brown adipose tissue (BAT) Ucp1 expression. Furthermore, PF and classic KD diets elicited distinct changes in global gene expression.",598c1152-d6ef-4b9b-9308-7a52dfc3ca56
24,discussion1," These data indicate that KD does not induce a molecular response similar to protein restriction and that PF and KD diets likely impact health and metabolism via unique underlying mechanisms.  Defining the effects of KD on metabolic health has been complicated by discrepancies in diet composition across studies, particularly in studies which use “control chow” diets. KD diets in published rodent studies contain between 4.5–20% protein with feeding durations from 3 days to 14 months. The present study helps clarify discrepancies by using standardized semi-purified diets that control for micronutrient composition and span the range of protein content found in published KD diets. In addition to KD diet composition, published studies differ with respect to control diet formulation.",035415bd-e4a1-439e-a94e-12acf2708487
25,discussion2," For studies that utilize a semi-purified ketogenic diet, the control diet should also be semi-purified in order to ensure that differences in micronutrient content, nutrient source or other non-nutritive components do not account for any of the phenotypic observations attributed to macronutrients. The diets used in the present study were prepared from the same semi-purified ingredients in order to evaluate the precise contribution of individual macronutrients.  Dietary fat source is another potential source of discrepancy across rodent KD studies. All KDs in this study contained cocoa butter as a fat source, while many published studies utilized the commercial KD from Bio-Serv (F-3666), which contains lard, butter, and corn oil. Cocoa butter differs from these sources in that it is plant-based, while the fat in F-3666 is primarily animal-based. In addition, these fat sources have different fatty acid compositions.",e17e0b70-baa5-47aa-879c-b7afaaa7465a
26,discussion3," Cocoa butter contains predominantly saturated fatty acids (about 60%), while the commercial diet contains 42.5% saturated and 57.5% unsaturated fatty acids. It has been shown that dietary fat source can impact the degree of lifespan extension by caloric restriction (58). Furthermore, mice fed a high fat diet containing lard had elevated insulin and HOMA-IR measurement of insulin resistance after 20 weeks compared to mice fed a plant-based high fat diet (soy and cotton oil) or a standard diet (59). In addition, a study in rats found that insulin resistance in diet-induced obesity was worse in response to high fat diets based on lard or olive oil, which are high in saturated and/or monounsaturated fatty acids, compared to those based on coconut fat or fish oil (60). Thus, although it is clear that dietary fat composition can modify many metabolic health parameters, more work is required to understand the effect of dietary fat composition in the context of KD.",3b27e1b9-6bea-461d-80f3-f4c4dc453c88
27,discussion4,"  It is also important to note that some effects of KD may be specific to the duration of feeding. Our finding that mice fed KD for 8 days do not have improved insulin tolerance, despite reduced blood glucose and insulin levels, is aligned with other studies that found no change or worsened insulin tolerance after 3 days (16) or 5–7 weeks KD (12, 61) in mice. However, Douris et al. found improved insulin sensitivity in mice fed KD for 8 weeks (13), along with many others reporting benefits beyond 8 weeks, indicating that beneficial adaptations occur in response to longer-term KD feeding. Animals must adapt to carbohydrate restriction by improving the efficiency of fat oxidation in order to support prolonged ketosis and to sustain energy homeostasis (62).",b7803517-ad8c-40d3-b720-b890e71ffdbe
28,discussion5," There is no consensus regarding the time it takes for rodents or humans to fully adapt to carbohydrate restriction, which has important implications for clinical trials using shorter-term interventions for example NCT03285152 and NCT04631445 in endometrial and pancreatic cancer. This study utilized short-term feeding to compare the physiological and molecular responses of KD vs. PF diets within a time window that may be more relevant for clinical applications like cancer adjuvant therapy.  The present study found no elevations in serum FGF21 and no induction of hepatic Fgf21 expression in mice fed the classic KD containing 10% protein. Published studies utilizing KD with 5% protein energy report increased plasma or hepatic FGF21 after 4–5 weeks (12, 61). Badman et al. show that FGF21 is required for lipid-based adaptations to KD with 5% protein (63), while Stemmer et al. show that FGF21 is not required for improved glucose homeostasis or ketosis upon KD with 5% or 13% protein (64).",d24dcbb5-8c23-4a47-b116-822ccff7d9e2
29,discussion6," Multiple studies demonstrate that supplementing a 5% protein KD up to 10% or 13% protein with fat or carb substitution abolishes FGF21 induction without substantially affecting ketogenesis (64, 65). This supports the notion that FGF21 induction and downstream thermogenesis is a response to low protein levels, and not ketogenesis per se. By carefully titrating the levels of protein in KD we further demonstrate that circulating FGF21 is induced in response to decreasing dietary protein, and not carbohydrate, content. This result is consistent with a published report demonstrating that low protein, high carbohydrate diets are associated with maximal FGF21 induction (66) and demonstrates that KD may act independently of dietary protein restriction to elicit metabolic or other health benefits. The classic clinical ketogenic protocol is a 4:1 ratio of fat to protein/carb, resulting in ∼90% of energy from fat and 10% from protein/carb.",59e1ea30-e0fc-4dc7-9ed8-3e5e0c36b10a
30,discussion7," This is in contrast with the most commonly used rodent KD, the Bio-Serv F3666, which contains 5% of energy from protein. Thus, we propose that future translational studies on KD utilize diets containing at least 10% protein to ensure that observations are due to carbohydrate, rather than protein restriction.  FGF21 signaling in the central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)) contributes to increased food intake during low-protein diet (5% protein) feeding, a phenomenon known as protein leverage (67). However, FGF21 signaling is not sufficient to overcome reduced food intake and body weight in response to very-low-protein diets (1% protein). This decrease in intake is at least partially attributed to reduced hypothalamic mTOR signaling (68, 69). Interestingly, increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) Ucp1 expression requires intact FGF21 signaling in the brain, but not in the adipose tissue (67).",ab737293-3741-4f8f-a49b-364cb2ea24ba
31,discussion8," In our study, mice fed the high-fat, protein-free diet (KD0P) had equal serum FGF21 and hepatic Fgf21 expression levels vs. high-carbohydrate PF-fed mice. However, the KD0P group had significantly reduced energy intake and did not have elevated brown adipose tissue (BAT) Ucp1 expression compared to mice fed containing 20% of energy from protein (CTL) and PF diets. Given that brain FGF21 signaling promotes energy intake and is required for Ucp1 induction, it is possible that these characteristics of mice fed the high-fat KD0P are a result of FGF21 resistance, which has been associated with high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice (70). This may also explain why markers of protein restriction are induced in response to KD0P in the liver, but not brown adipose tissue (BAT).  Consistent with this observed difference, on the transcriptional level PF and KD drove divergent gene expression programs.",37d71493-7bb8-4b64-bae6-5d77d83a42ad
32,discussion9," First, the overall transcriptional response to PF diet was amplified by substituting carbohydrate for fat (PF vs. KD0P, Figure 4A). The high fat background drove higher expression of multiple genes involved in amino acid synthesis including Psat1, Phgdh, and Asns, as well as the amino acid responsive transcription factor Atf4. weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) analysis identified a module containing these amino acid responsive genes which were further increased by high fat background. Atf4 was the third-most enriched TF-binding motif among these genes. However, Atf4 transcript level also increased in KDs where these amino acid-related targets did not increase. This leaves an open question about the role of ATF4 in driving this differential expression in response to KD0P vs. PF.  Clustering analysis reveal expression modules which were responsive to protein, to classic KD (KD10P) and to fat content independent of protein or ketogenesis.",603a48dd-d79d-4fb7-89ec-aaa53ff2875e
33,discussion10," Interestingly, the largest number of genes were positive responders to classic KD, with over 500 genes clustering in this pattern. The protein responsive clusters were primarily enriched for genes involved in amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, with increased expression of genes involved in non-essential amino acid synthesis and lipid degradation pathways. Among the most enriched pathways in the classic KD responsive gene set was oxidative phosphorylation, with expression of many mitochondrial genes, such as Ndufa10, Sdhb, and Sdhc increased in response to KD10P. Interestingly, these genes tended to be suppressed by reduced protein, even in the high fat background. Similarly, nucleotide metabolic processes were also enriched in response to classic KD (cluster 3). These pathways show some overlap with mitochondrial-related pathways and include genes like Mpc2, Upp2, and Pmvk.",ea048ee2-ae0c-4140-8b7a-32e153f8ea67
34,discussion11," Many of these nucleotide-related processes tended to show an overall suppression by high fat diet, suggesting that these increases are specific to the classic ketogenic diet, and not just due to high fat content. TF analyses showed enrichment of Atf and Hif signaling in low protein groups, with Atf1, Atf7, and Hif/Arnt showing strong enrichments. In the KD clusters, binding motifs for Fos/Jun were robustly enriched. These differential TF signatures support the divergent expression profiles seen in the gene expression analysis.  While this study clarifies that protein restriction shows relatively little overlap with KD, multiple outstanding questions remain. In particular, it will be important to understand how the molecular and metabolic adaptations to KD differ across feeding duration and how short vs. long-term adaptations are connected to stress resistance, weight loss and glucose homeostasis.",76bd8b48-587f-4be0-a3d0-fe4e63aa48b2
35,discussion12," In addition, it is unknown how ketosis or other KD-induced alterations impart the associated physiological changes. The transcriptomics data presented here provide novel insight into potential underlying mechanisms of KD and can serve as a starting point for future mechanistic studies. In conclusion, KD and protein-restricted diets produce similar physiological outcomes, though through distinct mechanisms, and more work is needed to define how short-term KD may be utilized therapeutically.
