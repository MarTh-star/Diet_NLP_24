0,introduction0,"Glioblastoma multiforme (glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)) or grade IV astrocytoma is a rapidly proliferating and invading glioma composed of a heterogeneous population of cell types, and it remains largely unmanageable (1, 2). Temozolomide (Temozolomide (TMZ)), a toxic alkylating agent, is one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs to combat glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (3). Despite its wide use in the clinic, Temozolomide (TMZ)'s most common side effects include hematological toxicity and gastrointestinal troubles, with nausea, vomiting, and anorexia being most common in patients (4). Upon diagnosis, and with the subsequent standard of care, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients have an expected survival of about 12 to 15 months with essentially no long-term survivors (5). A therapy that reduces or eliminates toxicity, while increasing efficacy is therefore necessary for the well-being and survival of the patient.",b5f84b59-3861-40e0-8dee-159f9fb73adc
1,introduction1,"  As previously described, VM-M3 is a syngeneic murine tumor model that closely mimics the phenotype of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in humans and was used in this study to test various glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment combinations. Although a single glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model may not be representative of all heterogeneous cell types in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), we chose the VM-M3 model because, to our knowledge, it is the only natural syngeneic model that manifests all the invasive growth characteristics seen in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and has been shown to exhibit the full spectrum of “Secondary Structures of Scherer” (6, 7). The VM-M3 murine model also exhibits abnormalities in cardiolipin that underlie defects in oxidative phosphorylation (8, 9). It is important to note that oxygen consumption is not always coupled to ATP production and therefore says little of the efficiency of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (10–13).",71c310f5-48e0-47d6-b583-1c63e1c466bd
2,introduction2," Cardiolipin is the signature phospholipid found in the inner mitochondrial membrane that regulates mitochondrial enzyme activity related to oxidative phosphorylation (14). Cardiolipin abnormality results in electron transport chain activity reduction and an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species via the prevention of coenzyme Q couple oxidation (15). Furthermore, the presence of aerobic fermentation in the VM-M3 tumor model has been established previously (16).  The Press-Pulse approach to cancer management provides a useful model for utilizing metabolic therapies in combatting cancer (17). Press therapies, like restricted feeding of ketogenic diets (KD-R), reduce available glucose while increasing ketone bodies. Ketone bodies can replace glucose as a fuel for cells with normal mitochondrial function. Cancer cells, however, cannot metabolize ketone bodies for energy due to multiple defects in the number, structure, and function of their mitochondria.",3e9e03c7-270a-4f50-9f5a-b44e053d30aa
3,introduction3," The KD-R reduces levels of glucose and substrates for both the glycolytic and the pentose phosphate pathways. As a result, cellular energy is reduced and the synthesis of downstream precursors, like glutathione, are hindered. Cancer cells rely heavily on the aerobic fermentation of glucose, which explains the importance of the KD-R in combating cancer (18–22). If administered properly, the KD-R can have extensive health benefits. However, it is important to note that diabetic ketoacidosis is a dangerous complication in patients with type I diabetes. In ketoacidosis, the acids 3-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid are produced, which overwhelm the body's acid-base buffering system leading to a variety of health complications. If the KD-R is consumed and an appropriate Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) is monitored and maintained, the regulated and controlled production of ketone bodies causes a beneficial physiological state called dietary ketosis.",9b2f3fb0-ee4b-47ca-9e6a-9581256d5d15
4,introduction4," In this state, the blood pH remains buffered within normal limits (23).  This KD-R press therapy is used to prime tumor cells for more acute pulse therapies that further target glucose and glutamine (17). One potential pulse therapy includes oxaloacetate (oxaloacetate (OAA)). This compound is an important intermediate in the citric acid cycle, but has also been shown to participate in the deamination of glutamate and to serve as a mitochondrial biogenesis enhancer (24, 25). At appropriate levels, Glutamate (Glu) serves as the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system and is released from synaptic vesicles upon introduction of calcium. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, an excess amount of Glu is released, which enhances the already malignant phenotype (3, 26–28). The continuous buildup of Glu in the extracellular environment provides resistance to apoptosis and enhances proliferation and invasion of the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells (29).",3465c717-7dd4-4a8e-89c6-7ca0423335e8
5,introduction5," Further studies observed that glutamate secretion by neoplastic glia promotes tumor expansion by enhancing the inflammatory response within tumor surroundings (30). As shown previously, oxaloacetate (OAA), may be used via glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase to enhance the naturally occurring brain to blood efflux of Glu. This has been shown to enhance neuro-protection, reduce the negative prognosis of the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patient, and serve as an adjuvant for Temozolomide (TMZ) (24, 31). In both human consumers and preclinical models, oxaloacetate (OAA) has exhibited little toxicity or negative side effects, if administered at an appropriate dose. In fact, along with its potential anti-tumor effects, there is evidence to suggest that oxaloacetate (OAA) can enhance lifespan and overall health (32).  We predicted that the use of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBO2T), as another pulse therapy, would further enhance the cocktail treatment via increased plasma oxygen saturation.",e0b5de76-0869-4c90-8b25-397e81153a1d
6,introduction6," HBO2T involves administration of 100% oxygen under pressure (2.5 ATM abosolute), and has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and reduce blood vessel density (33). The increased oxygen saturation facilitates oxygen delivery to the tissues and reduces the hypoxic microenvironment (34). It also enhances tumor-cell production of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), which contributes to redox stress and subsequent cancer cell death. While under KD-R, normal cells transition to ketone body metabolism and achieve therapeutic ketosis, which provides protection from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress (35, 36). The appropriate use and administration of HBO2T provides little risk to the patient. Yet, if left unmonitored, HBO2T has the potential to cause mild barotrauma, pulmonary oxygen toxicity, and ocular side effects (37). However, it is important to note that 2.",71166c34-a6ac-40db-bacd-01fdbba80583
7,introduction7,"5 ATM absolute is within the therapeutic range of pressures for mice and has been observed to show little negative side-effects. Therapeutic efficacy in both mice and humans is observed when oxygen partial pressures within the body exceed the partial pressure at normal atmospheric pressure. This enhanced oxygen partial pressure in mice under 2.5 ATM absolute HBO2T has been shown experimentally (38, 39). With the nontoxic treatments of KD-R, HBO2T, and oxaloacetate (OAA) working simultaneously in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients (+/- Temozolomide (TMZ)), it was predicted that the overall prognosis and survival would significantly increase. ",d852a07b-a4d8-45be-8127-653740cfb107
8,methods0," Our proposed approach for inhibiting tumor metabolism involved various combinations of the KD-R, oxaloacetate (2 mg/g), hyperbaric oxygen, and Temozolomide (TMZ) (20 mg/kg). This combinatorial therapy was tested on adult VM/Dk mice bearing the VM-M3/Fluc preclinical glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model grown orthotopically. After 14 days, tumor growth was quantified via bioluminescence. A survival study was performed and the data were analyzed and portrayed in a Kaplan Meier plot. Preliminary dosage studies were used and strict diet and drug administration was maintained throughout the study.  Mice and experimental glioblastoma multiforme model Mice of the VM/Dk (VM) strain were obtained as a gift from H. Fraser (University of Edinburgh, Scotland) and were housed and bred in the Boston College Animal Facility as previously described (40).",6f2b4c2b-8df4-4526-ae9f-f88e0330110a
9,methods1," Adult male and female mice (10–12 weeks of age) were used for the studies and the procedures for animal use were in strict accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee at Boston College under assurance number A3905-01. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee at Boston College. The VM-M3 tumor used in this study arose spontaneously in the cerebrum of adult VM mice and was characterized as previously described (6).  Transduction of cell lines and bioluminescent imaging The VM-M3 cell line was transduced with a lentivirus vector containing the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (VM-M3/Fluc) as we previously described (41). The Xenogen IVIS system (Xenogen, Hopkington, MA) is used to record the bioluminescent signal from the VM-M3/Fluc tumor cells (VM-M3).",4237fbe3-5555-4378-bc55-9cd52add84d1
10,methods2," For in-vivo imaging, mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane vapor and received an intraperitoneal injection of d-Luciferin (50 mg/kg, Syd Labs) in PBS. Imaging times ranged from 1 to 5 min. For ex-vivo imaging, brains were removed and the right and left cortex were separated at the medial longitudinal fissure. Each section was imaged in 0.3 mg d-Luciferin in PBS and bioluminescent values were combined for whole brain bioluminescent data.  Intracranial tumor implantation Tumor implantation is performed as previously described (40, 42, 43). Briefly, mice are anesthetized with 5% isoflurane vapor and the hair on the top of the head is removed. The skin is then disinfected with ethanol followed by betadine. A small sagittal incision is made in the scalp of the mouse over the midline. 1.0 mm3 tumor tissue fragments of VM-M3 tumor are implanted surgically into the right cerebral cortex according to our standard procedures. The flaps of skin are then closed with 7 mm reflex clips.",d9c6ef2d-cf28-41fe-9e52-224cb7612e82
11,methods3," It is important to mention that tissue fragments were chosen because they contain an already established tumor microenvironment that increases tumor “take” and rapid tumor growth.  Dietary regimens and body weight All mice received the standard diet unrestricted (SD-UR) prior to initiation of the study. Upon implantation of the tumor, mice remained on the SD-UR until a 15-h fast was initiated 72 h after implantation. Following the fast, mice were introduced to the Ketogenic diet restricted, or remained on the SD-UR, depending on the study group. The KD-R was made fresh weekly by combining dry KetoGEN powder with dH2O in a 2:1 ratio. The KD-R has a caloric density of 7.12 Kcal/g. The percent nutritional breakdown of KetoGEN is as follows: 2.1% of Cal from carbohydrates, 8.7% of Cal from protein, and 89.2% of Cal from fat. Mice were individually housed beginning at the 15 h fast and food intake for the KD-R mice was measured to be 1–3 g per day to maintain a 12–15% body weight reduction.",cdd2f3c8-1f67-4799-96b8-0de149cb0b17
12,methods4," Mice were weighed daily to ensure weight maintenance (44).  Measurement of plasma glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate, and glucose ketone index Blood was collected from mice on the last day of the experiment to reduce endpoint value variability. This procedure was in accordance with IACUC's recommendation for blood volume collection over a 2-week period. All mice were fasted for 2 h before blood collection to stabilize glucose levels. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and the blood was collected from the submandibular facial vein. The blood was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 10 min, and the plasma was collected and stored at −80°C until assayed. Plasma glucose concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using the Trinder Assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentration was measured using the Sigma-Aldrich Ketone Body Assay Kit (MAK134) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) (45).",0281659a-457a-449b-b2b7-11acb08369de
13,methods5," The Glucose Ketone Index (Glucose Ketone Index (GKI)) was calculated by dividing values of glucose (mM) by values of β-hydroxybutyrate (mM) (46).  Drug preparation and administration of therapies The KD-R was initiated on day 4 after tumor cell implantation into the brain. As oxaloacetate (OAA) (Terra Biological LLC, San Diego, CA) is unstable in solution, we administered oxaloacetate (OAA) to the mice daily in the diet (2.0 mg/g body wt) beginning on day 5 (25). Temozolomide (TMZ) (20 mg/kg) was administered via an intraperitoneal injection, every other day beginning on day 5, in a 10% DMSO, 90% PBS vehicle, as described previously (47). Mice were injected with Temozolomide (TMZ) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) 2 h following the KD-R feeding, and were then placed into the hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Control mice received the vehicle only.  Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Mice were placed into a hyperbaric chamber and received 100% O2 for 90 min at 2.",718a390f-5527-4190-b18d-4297e758602f

16,results0," The therapeutic effect of all treatments was powerful when administered under KD-R. The most promising survival advantage was seen in the two groups receiving oxaloacetate without Temozolomide (TMZ). The survival of mice receiving Temozolomide (TMZ) was diminished due to its apparent toxicity. Among all groups, those receiving Temozolomide (TMZ) had the most significant reduction in tumor growth. The most powerful therapeutic effect was evident with combinations of these therapies.  Conclusion: This study provides evidence for a potentially novel therapeutic regimen of hyperbaric oxygen, oxaloacetate, and the KD-R for managing growth and progression of VM-M3/Fluc glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).",c979941a-1188-48aa-85c5-9677ebd48335
17,results1,"  oxaloacetatetemozolomideketogenic diethyperbaric oxygen therapycancer ==== Body The objective of this study was to determine if a therapeutic strategy involving a combination of the KD-R, oxaloacetate, hyperbaric oxygen, and temozolomide would be better for managing the VM-M3 mouse glioblastoma than would using the individual therapies alone. We evaluated the dosage, scheduling, and timing needed to achieve the most favorable therapeutic response. It was determined in preliminary studies that 2 mg/g of oxaloacetate (OAA) and 20 mg/kg of Temozolomide (TMZ) were significantly more efficacious than low dose for both treatments (1 mg/g of oxaloacetate (OAA) and 10 mg/kg Temozolomide (TMZ); Supplementary Figure 1). The scheduling and timing was based on these preliminary studies and on the observed VM/Dk mouse response to each treatment. Following our experimental design, we measured tumor growth via bioluminescent imaging (Figure 1A).",925e83bd-ecc7-4853-8e89-1d589ed1f890
18,results2," Due to the rapid growth of the VM-M3 tumor, and the short window of drug treatment (~9 days), the benefits of taking multiple in vivo bioluminescent images throughout the study did not justify the inherent risk of potentially losing or altering the endpoint values. Therefore, only one bioluminescent reading was taken at the end of the tumor growth study. The termination day occurred when the average body weight loss of SD-UR mice exceeded 1–1.5 grams per day (5% body weight loss per day). Therefore, the termination day from study to study ranges from day 13 to day 15 with an average being day 14. Additionally, the body weights of all KD-R mice were monitored daily to ensure that a 12–15% body weight reduction was maintained during the course of the study (Figure 1B). A statistically significant average body weight reduction was observed at day 11 in the mice receiving Temozolomide (TMZ) in comparison to all other groups.",3cb516a3-954c-44e5-a78d-8d7c80ad6bcf
19,results3," This weight reduction was due in part to reduced daily consumption of the KD-R, indicating potential toxicity.

(A) Mice were implanted on day 0 with tissue fragments of the VM-M3 glioblastoma and given 3 days to recover before the initiation of KD-R. oxaloacetate (OAA) was administered in the food and prepared fresh daily, as described in the materials and methods. Temozolomide (TMZ) and HBO2T were administered the following day as described in the materials and methods. The experiment was terminated at day 14 when an average number of mice under the SD-UR showed signs of morbidity. In each experiment, SD-UR mice had an average life span of approximately 12–15 days following tumor implantation. Brains were removed and imaged ex vivo to measure bioluminescence.",abd6d305-52eb-42cb-a42c-5f0890d409fd
20,results4," (B) The body weight of mice receiving SD-UR recovered after the 15 h fast on day 3, but began to decline by day 10 due to tumor burden. The KD-R group and all groups that did not receive Temozolomide (TMZ) treatment (– Temozolomide (TMZ)) maintained a 12–15% body weight reduction throughout the study. The mice receiving Temozolomide (TMZ) treatment (+ Temozolomide (TMZ)) experienced a 20% body weight reduction by day 11. On day 11, there was a significant difference in body weight (*) between the –Temozolomide (TMZ) group and the +Temozolomide (TMZ) group (P < 0.05). On days 10 and 12, there was a trend toward significance between these two groups.  The first set of experiments involved the bioluminescent quantification of mice receiving combinations of KD-R, HBO2T, and oxaloacetate (OAA), as an adjuvant with or without Temozolomide (TMZ).

24,results8," Glucose Ketone Index (GKI) values were calculated for each animal by dividing glucose concentration by ketone concentration, as described. Values represent the mean ± SEM. All groups are statistically different from SD-UR (p < 0.05). No group under the KD-R are statistically different from each other.  Survival studies were also performed to determine if the therapeutic protocols used in the in vivo tumor progression studies also enhanced mouse survival. Mice were monitored daily and euthanized at the appearance of severe neurological damage from tumor growth or when they lost more than 30% of their starting body weight. SD-UR fed control mice reached morbidity at an average of 15 days post implantation (Figure 3). Survival was longest in the mice receiving oxaloacetate (OAA). The oxaloacetate (OAA) alone did not significantly reduce tumor growth (Figure 2B), but enhanced the overall survival significantly in comparison to SD-UR and KD-R (Figure 3).",2329509d-9cad-48b7-9a25-f8594ade02e3
25,results9," A significant survival advantage was also found when oxaloacetate (OAA) (2.0 mg/g) was combined with HBO2T under KD-R. Temozolomide (TMZ) treated mice reached morbidity at an average of 20 days due to potential drug toxicity, as indicated by significant body weight loss by day 11 and apparent lethargy. Though the brain tumor bioluminescence in the Temozolomide (TMZ) treated mice was lower than all other treated groups, the overall survival was diminished in comparison, potentially due to the toxic effects of Temozolomide (TMZ) (2). There was no statistical difference in survival between genders in any study group (Supplemental Figure 2B).

27,discussion0,"The goal of this study was to determine if a press-pulse metabolic therapy would be more effective in reducing growth of the VM-M3 murine glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model than would treatment with single therapies. We found that tumor growth inhibition and mouse survival was better under a combination treatment of KD-R, oxaloacetate (OAA), and HBO2T than under single agent treatment. Although inclusion of Temozolomide (TMZ) in the therapeutic cocktail caused significant reduction in VM-M3 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) growth, it also caused excessive body weight loss and reduced survival in comparison to other treatment groups. Potential gastrointestinal troubles following the administration of Temozolomide (TMZ) may have caused the reduced food consumption and the subsequent loss of body weight.",747ab439-3379-4aec-a992-1ddef2960879
28,discussion1," However, it is possible, that further studies may find that lower dosages and modes of Temozolomide (TMZ) delivery could impact the toxicity, efficacy, and survival seen in mice receiving combinatorial therapy with Temozolomide (TMZ). It is important to note that although average survival improved significantly for mice receiving oxaloacetate (OAA) alone, no significant reduction was found for bioluminescent photon count in comparison to the KD-R alone. Also, KD-R alone did not significantly reduce tumor growth in comparison to SDUR, which can be explained by the necessity of available glutamine along with glucose in cancers, especially glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (6, 26).  Similarly, we found no statistically significant difference in tumor growth or survival between the KD-R group and the mice receiving HBO2T. Although Poff AM, et al.",64fc7bf3-56a0-4ccc-aea7-ba84dfaab571

Also, Poff AM, et al. initiated the therapeutic regimen on the day of tumor inoculation, whereas our mice started receiving treatment on day 4 (35). Furthermore, throughout most of the survival study, the overall health and appearance of mice receiving oxaloacetate (OAA) in combination with HBO2T was noticeably better than in mice that received oxaloacetate (OAA) alone. This led to our conclusion that oxaloacetate (OAA) alone may serve as a supplement for maintaining cancer patient health, while the combination of a KD-R, oxaloacetate (OAA), and HBO2T could be a potential anti-cancer therapy.",846fa053-a846-47cf-bf80-9ab27e19a839
30,discussion3," As progression free survival and overall survival are key determinants of therapeutic success for cancer therapy, our findings showed that this proposed metabolic therapy without the inclusion of Temozolomide (TMZ) was beneficial to therapeutic success in this preclinical glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model.  Although several studies have suggested that oxaloacetate (OAA) participates in the deamination of glutamate into α-ketoglutarate, serves as a mitochondrial biogenesis enhancer, and may act as a calorie restriction mimetic, the mechanism by which oxaloacetate (OAA) influences cancer progression remains unclear (24, 25, 27, 28). It did not appear from our studies that oxaloacetate (OAA) acted as a calorie restriction mimetic as no statistically significant differences were observed in glucose or ketone levels between any of the study groups under KD-R.",d28b8a4d-3b28-4540-a2d2-c307690b0a4f
31,discussion4," Further studies are needed to evaluate mechanisms that underlie the observed effect between KD-R, oxaloacetate (OAA), and HBO2T along with the potential ability for oxaloacetate (OAA) to participate in the deamination of glutamate and to serve as a mitochondrial biogenesis enhancer. However, it is important to note the observation that oxaloacetate (OAA) may induce cell death in the human hepatic carcinoma cell line HepG2 through induction of apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation (49).  The effect observed in the mouse groups receiving KD-R, oxaloacetate (OAA), and HBO2T could prove more efficacious if combined with inhibitors of glucose, glutamine, and autophagy. Indeed, a recent study showed that a press-pulse therapeutic strategy used with a modified standard of care significantly improved the outcome of a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patient (50).",36620471-b5dc-4f65-b1c2-76986d283cb6
32,discussion5," Further combinations of nontoxic metabolic treatments must be studied to enhance the survival of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients while maximizing their long-term health and quality of life. This study is one example of nontoxic targeting of energy metabolism in a preclinical glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) murine model. It also provides evidence for the efficacy of combinatorial HBO2T, oxaloacetate (OAA), and the KD-R for managing growth and progression of the VM-M3/Fluc tumor.
