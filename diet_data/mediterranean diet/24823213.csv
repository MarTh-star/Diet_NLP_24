Conclusion It is hypothesised that exercise and Mediterranean diet interventions, both individually and in combination, will result in improvements in cognitive performance compared with controls. Positive findings in this research will have potential implications for the management of aged care, particularly in respect to reducing the rate of cognitive decline and the associated impacts both on the individual and the broader community.",14a811c2-168a-4ba6-b239-858e85e4b778

This phenomenon of cognitive decline is of considerable concern on an individual level. In ageing and elderly populations significant concerns exist regarding the loss of mental faculties and independence of living, which is a cause of considerable psychological distress [1].  On a societal level this phenomenon is also of substantial concern, particularly with the current rapid ageing of the population. The over 60s are the fastest growing age demographic on Earth [6].",0f117b10-b8ca-4836-beca-0c46666e2390
3,methods3," It is predicted, that almost one third of the total population of the planet will be aged 60 years or older by 2100 [7], with this percentage predicted to be reached by just 2025 in the Pacific/Oceanic region [8]. In Australia alone, the combined financial cost of formal and informal care of those with cognitive impairment and dementia was estimated to be around AU$8.2 billion in 2010 [9]. This cost is expected to rise to over AU$28 billion by 2040, causing considerable strain on the economy. It has also been predicted that a reduction of just two years in the onset of care requirements due to these age related cognitive issues could result in a 10 % reduction in the overall financial burden [9]. Given the societal and personal consequences, understanding the mechanisms behind the differential rates of cognitive ageing, and designing strategies to prevent or reduce the rate of cognitive decline that are simple and cost effective to implement, are of critical importance.",075cb2d3-9cbf-4c99-a3c7-0282f80f0b19
4,methods4,"  What is cognitive ageing? While there are multiple ways to characterise cognitive ability, it is commonly divided into crystallised intelligence and fluid intelligence. Crystallised intelligence refers to the knowledge and skills that are accumulated over a lifetime [10, 11]. This includes mental functions such as verbal ability, general knowledge and some numerical abilities [2]. Fluid intelligence, often highly associated with cognitive speed [12], refers to the ability to process information, think abstractly and solve problems. This includes aspects of memory, executive functioning and reasoning, and is considered to be largely innately determined [2, 13]. There is general consensus that while crystallised intelligence remains intact until late old age, fluid abilities decline progressively from middle adulthood onwards [14, 15]; and this decline appears to affect a number of fluid cognitive functions simultaneously.",85b5f0fd-7df2-44f7-8f6e-3b838fb58e23
5,methods5," However, while the average performance on most fluid cognitive tasks have been found to decline with age, many studies have shown that some older people display comparatively little change, whereas others deteriorate quite rapidly [16, 17] and that this variability increases with increasing age [5].  Earlier research on the relationship between age and cognitive decline indicates that an individual’s cognitive performance increases up until adolescence or early adulthood and then progressively declines. However, the age at which decline begins and the extent of decline varies for different abilities [18]. It is the ageing brain and the consequences of long term effects on the brain that result in speed and memory performance decline [10, 14]. The ageing of the brain may be considered as a progressive and inevitable process potentially related to inflammation, the accumulation of oxidative stress and the related damage to cellular structures of the brain [19].",b1f69ba0-315d-47c8-919e-af8f01771883
6,methods6," During normal ageing the brain may suffer morphological and functional deterioration that will potential affect neurotransmission and the alteration of motor and sensory systems, sleep, memory and potential learning [19–22].  A comprehensive review of earlier studies concluded that a slower rate of cognitive ageing could be predicted to a certain degree (along with other factors such as more years of education and an absence of the APOE ε4 allele) by an active lifestyle and better cardiovascular health [10]. This apparent effect of cardiovascular health on the rate of cognitive decline associated with increasing age has also been found by numerous recent studies [23–25]. More specifically, along with avoidance of smoking and limited alcohol consumption, optimisation of cardiovascular health can be most readily achieved through regular exercise and an anti-inflammatory diet focused on fruits and vegetables, such as the Mediterranean diet [26].",21aff30a-eac9-4d9c-b5a1-a7c0975e36d2
7,methods7,"  Cognition and exercise Numerous studies have identified benefits of exercise training for the cognitive functioning of older adults [27]. A meta-analysis, published in 2012, of 29 studies in older adults free from dementia, demonstrated that aerobic exercise interventions, ranging from 8 to 72 weeks, improved cognitive faculties including attention, processing speed, executive function, and memory [28] In a recent Australian study, older participants engaged in moderate aerobic exercise for 50 min three times per week for 6 months [29]. At the end of the study period, individuals in the exercise condition showed enhanced cognition in comparison to those not engaged in the exercise regime.  The cognitive benefits of exercise appear to increase with frequency of exercise [30], and are greatest for moderate (31–45 min) duration exercise sessions [27].",fbe8bafb-eaef-45b3-832b-2d618c73fff4
8,methods8," Whilst it has been suggested that the greatest cognitive improvements may occur when aerobic exercise is combined with strength training [28], there is evidence that walking programs may also be effective to improve cognitive function [31]. In a recent study conducted in seniors, half of the participants took part in a 90 min weekly walking program and half served as a control group [32]. After 3 months there was a significant improvement in word fluency, social interaction and motor function in those who participated in the walking program.  Several mechanisms of action have been proposed to account for the cognitive benefits of exercise in older adults. Long term effects of exercise may have indirect effects upon neurocognitive functioning by reducing diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease [33]. Exercise may also have direct effects on brain physiology.",12b6e9ca-0927-4dbb-8555-6177c75e04cb
9,methods9," There is increasing evidence that extended periods of exercise leads to increased volume of the hippocampus, a brain region vital for memory function, as well as reducing the rate of cerebral grey matter shrinkage [34]. Shorter term mechanisms have also been proposed, due to the identification of cognitive improvements following exercise interventions of several months [28]. For example, exercise may protect against inflammatory processes and regulate growth factor signalling in the brain [33]. Furthermore it has been suggested that exercise may interact with brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurochemical which modulates brain plasticity, neuritic outgrowth, synaptic function, and can stimulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis [34].  Cognition and diet Dietary factors are considered to have a powerful influence on brain function on a daily basis [35].",378a07eb-eaa6-49a0-a643-5d6374dabecd
10,methods10," With respect to the type of diet that may be of long term benefit, it has been found that people who adhere to a Mediterranean-style diet could reduce the potential for progression from healthy cognitive function to mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) and subsequently to dementia [36–39]. Additionally, a diet higher in components of the Mediterranean diet has been found to correlate positively with reduced changes in Mini Mental State Examination (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)) scores over five or more years in cognitively healthy people over the age of 65 [40–42]. The Mediterranean diet refers to the dietary practices of populations from the Mediterranean regions. This diet consists predominantly of fruits, vegetables, nuts, cereals, legumes, fish and olive oil, with a moderate intake of alcohol and lower consumption of red meat and poultry.",7f4e0d84-3395-45ad-9b0e-be868d6e8d89
11,methods11," Adherence to the Mediterranean diet has also been linked to lower risk of mortality and vascular events [43], as well a reduction in the incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [38].  It has also been found that specific nutritional intake has an impact on overall mental health and function [44]. Antioxidant-rich and flavonol containing components of the Mediterranean diet have been correlated with better performance on spatial working memory in younger women, aged 19 to 30 years, in as little as 10 days [45]. This correlation was also found across multiple measures of memory in people aged 55 to 80 years [46].  Similar to exercise interventions, it is likely that vascular processes and inflammatory pathways may also mediate the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and cognition. An eight week Mediterranean diet intervention has been showed to reduce circulatory markers of inflammation [47, 48].",660d76ba-2aa3-4e48-9d19-ddd216368588
12,methods12," This may be due to the combined effects of a range of components of the Mediterranean diet. A higher intake of fruit and vegetables has been associated with higher blood nutrient levels, lower oxidative stress and better cognitive function [49]. A high consumption of fruit and vegetables, or a diet that is full of antioxidants, carotenoids, vitamins, fibre and magnesium, has been shown to be beneficial in reducing C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) levels, a marker of inflammation closely linked to cognition [50]. In addition, flavonoids found in fruit and vegetables, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in high quantities in fish, have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, cardio-protective and neuro-protective properties [51, 52].  The cardio-protective nature of the Mediterranean diet has been investigated through an intervention study involving 342 participants.",08169571-2876-475b-9cd4-2341642f121c
13,methods13," This study found that on a 10 point Mediterranean diet adherence scale, even a 1 point increase in adherence to this type of diet resulted in an 18 % reduction in the relative associated risk of a myocardial infarction [53]. It has also been found that the increased consumption of olive oil and whole grains, that are part of a Mediterranean diet, are both independently associated with a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure [54]. Additionally, another major component of the Mediterranean diet, the increased intake of fish, has also been found to reduce both blood pressure and blood lipids [37, 55]. Finally, it been suggested that the Mediterranean diet may benefit insulin sensitivity and subsequently have a positive effect on decreasing cardiovascular disease [56].",d33a6e21-2f4f-4474-9eee-978f1bc08b7a
14,methods14," This is further supported by reviews of Mediterranean food patterns and prevention of chronic disease, which have found that greater adherence to the Mediterranean style of diet was associated with a reduction in coronary heart disease [53, 57].  To date, very few studies have conducted randomised controlled based assessment of the effect of Mediterranean diet on health or cognitive outcomes. Recently a 3-arm control randomised study was undertaken using a Mediterranean diet pattern and nuts. The results of this study indicated that the Mediterranean diet has a protective effect on cardiovascular health and also cognitive function [58]. However, the mechanisms by which Mediterranean diet may actually achieve the observed improvements in cognitive performance or improved cardiovascular health have not yet been fully investigated.",4e90d517-5701-4197-9b32-d8224fadd0a4
15,methods15," In particular the effect of this diet on the combination of arterial stiffness, central pulse pressures, circulatory biomarkers of inflammation and changes in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Additionally, while there have been numerous observational studies, to date no clinical trial of the effects of a Mediterranean diet, in elderly populations, using sensitive tests of specific cognitive functions, has been found.  Cognition and combined exercise and diet Exercise can potentially overcome the effects of a poor diet [59] and, in animal trials, exercise has been found to improve cognitive performance and increase hippocampal brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rats with diet induced cognitive decline [60]. Conversely, it has been suggested that diet high in fruit and vegetables, combined with exercise, can assist the brain to cope with several types of insults and ultimately benefit brain function over time [59].",95b5ef47-9958-4720-bbb6-a3338376dd80
16,methods16,"  Healthy diet and exercise are associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline and may provide opportunities to reduce the threat of cognitive decline more effectively than that which is currently understood [61]. With the increasing understanding of molecular biology it has been shown that diet and exercise can affect analogous molecular systems and that this can help lead us to understand a mechanism by which lifestyle, such as exercise and diet may positively influence brain plasticity [59]. Additionally, endothelial dysfunction has been associated with reduced cognitive performance [62], and, in a recent study of healthy older people, a combined Mediterranean diet and exercise intervention was found to provide enduring improvement in vascular endothelial function [63].",a16ae7c2-7836-49a1-853d-7a69436ae1c3
17,methods17,"  However, while there is support for the idea that Mediterranean diet and exercise will combine synergistically to reduce the rate of cognitive decline, there are two main aspects which require further investigation. Firstly, while there is an acknowledged need for a clinical trial of the effects of exercise and diet on cognitive function [61, 64], no such trial has been undertaken as yet. Secondly, the mechanisms by which Mediterranean diet and exercise may affect cognition have yet to be fully investigated. The current study aims to address both of these issues.  Aims and study hypotheses The primary aim of the current study is to examine the 6-month effects of increased exercise through walking, change to a Mediterranean diet, and a combination of both, on cognitive performance in an elderly population living independently in aged care facilities.",02975551-0b2e-40da-b784-23f37bd090ba
18,methods18," It is hypothesised that measures of cognitive performance will be improved in both the exercise and dietary interventions, relative to the controls, and that the combined diet and exercise intervention will show the greatest improvement of all groups.  As a secondary aim, this study will also investigate the associations between cognitive function and blood based biomarkers and cardiovascular function, which have been proposed as mechanisms, or indicators of mechanisms, that may influence the rate of cognitive ageing. By investigating these variables, the current study aims to identify and target modifiable risk factors, as well as identifying objective biological indicators of the efficacy of interventions that are aimed at ameliorating the rate of cognitive ageing.  Design and methodology Design This is a randomised, controlled, four-arm parallel groups design.",08751ef6-722a-44db-abbf-0f80838da34b
19,methods19," However, given the nature of the interventions, this study is not blinded as both investigators and participants will clearly know what the intervention is, as participants in the lifestyle arms will be actively working towards maintaining the lifestyle change. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the following four groups:Control  Exercise intervention  Dietary intervention  Combined dietary and exercise intervention    The randomisation sequence will be created by permuting into blocks of 4. While allocation of participants to these groups will be randomised, for reasons of practicality, and to avoid cross contamination between the requirements of each group, when cohabiting couples participate, one person will be randomly allocated to a group and the other will be allocated to the same group.",cb6df933-1e07-429f-b143-05d8b25c0556

These residents live in their own unit or similar accommodation, and are generally physically and mentally capable of caring for themselves in all aspects of daily living. The independent aged care resident population was selected due the generally greater homogeneity of the population and living conditions than that found in the broader community. Furthermore, by focusing on independent living in aged care facilities, this research aims to examine the efficacy of programs aimed at minimising cognitive decline and reducing the rate of transfer to low and high care accommodation.

This study was ethically approved by the Swinburne University Human Research Ethics Committee (project number 2013/057) and all participants will provide written consent from both themselves and their general practitioner before commencement in the trial.  Sample size To date no studies using specific measures of cognition more sensitive than the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) have investigated the cognitive effects of a Mediterranean dietary intervention in the elderly. However, numerous trials have examined the effects of exercise fitness interventions.",fcbbae53-b93a-43c2-81ef-b78df4ecbb2b
23,methods23," In a meta-analysis conducted to investigate the potential for fitness training to improve cognition in sedentary, but otherwise healthy, older adults, fitness training increased cognitive performance 0.5 SD on average, regardless of the type of cognitive task or the training method [27]. Using Cohen’s effect size criteria, this represents a medium effect size [65]. Although there are no relevant trials which have focussed on the Mediterranean diet, from which to determine an effect size, we have previously identified slightly larger effect sizes on Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB) memory measures following several months combined micronutrient, mineral and herbal supplementation in older people with risk factors for cognitive decline [66, 67]. We would anticipate the dietary change condition may exert many of the same benefits as micronutrient dietary supplementation, therefore a comparable effect size may be anticipated.",a755dc03-f697-4e9a-835a-c91d9ac02668
24,methods24," Power analysis was conducted using GPower 3.1.3 to determine the sample size required for a four armed intervention (exercise change only, diet change only, exercise and diet change, no change) using an analysis of variance (an analysis of variance (ANOVA)) design. It was indicated that a total sample of 128 participants would be required to detect a moderate effect size (f = 0.30), power of 80 % and a significance level of 5 %. Based on previous trials conducted by the Swinburne University Centre for Human Psychopharmacology, an allowance for a 15 % drop out from the trial has been factored in. Therefore, a total sample of 148 participants will be recruited for this trial, with 37 individuals randomised to each arm of the study.",0511a46f-83a5-4e22-8020-a077d0bcf72b
25,methods25,"  Interventions Mediterranean diet Those allocated to one of the diet change groups will be required to record their estimate of their percentage adherence to the Mediterranean diet programme each day, with the goal of reaching and maintaining an 85 % adherence rate over the duration of the study. This programme has been produced in association with a specialist nutritional organisation, and includes a structured four week programme with meal ideas and recipes. Additionally, these participants will be supplied with a standard high-quality extra virgin olive oil to use for the duration of the trial.  Exercise While there are a number of types of exercise which are potentially cognitively beneficial, walking has been selected for this study. Regular walking, in particular, has been shown to have cognitive benefits in older cohorts [31, 32].",9117c6ae-9358-42b5-afbf-a9b46fa28492
26,methods26," Additionally, walking does not require supervision or training from a health professional and may be suitable for frail elders or those with some functional limitations. For these reasons a walking program is deemed suitable for older participants and will be practical and cost effective to implement.  Those allocated to a group which includes exercise will be required to walk 4 to 5 times a week. They will follow a graduated program with the aim of walking at least 35–40 min as their aerobic exercise. Any participants who already walk this amount regularly will be asked to increase the amount of walking they do. Participants will be provided with pedometers and will be asked to record the number of minutes walked, distance travelled and the number of steps taken for each walking session.

This battery uses a simple 5 button interface and has been validated in other studies involving the elderly [70, 71]. The eight measures of cognitive functioning assessed by the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB) consist of Simple and Choice Reaction Times, Immediate and Delayed Recognition, Congruent and Incongruent Stroop colour-words, Spatial Working Memory and Contextual Memory.

Analysis Primary outcome The primary outcome will be response time on the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB) memory measures. Previously benefits to response time on Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB) memory measures has been demonstrated following multivitamin [67] and other nutraceutical intervention [68]. Mixed design, repeated measures analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) will be used to assess treatment-related changes in cognitive performance over the study.",dfaaa427-fd6f-431a-b3ed-800712289279
38,methods38," Relevant covariates may include group differences in cognitive performance or biomarkers at baseline and co-habitation of participants, where couples are taking part in the intervention trial.  Secondary outcomes All other cognitive, biomarker, mood, wellness and exercise measures will be treated as secondary outcomes. Mixed design, repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to assess treatment-related changes in all secondary outcomes over the study. Hierarchical regression will be used to establish the relationship between change in biomarkers and changes in cognitive function. Secondary analysis will examine the pooled effects of the two intervention arms involving the Mediterranean diet versus the control arm and the two intervention arms involving exercise versus the control arm.",aeff8e13-ec4e-4471-a930-72f7a59f3a10
39,methods39,"  Conclusion With the rapid ageing of the global population and the commensurate increase in age related cognitive decline, there is an exigent need for broadly available and easily implemented public health interventions that are aimed at ameliorating this issue. There is support for the efficacy of both the Mediterranean style of diet and aerobic exercise interventions in positively affecting cognitive performance in older adults. However, at present, much of the evidence is observational or not balanced by the use of control groups. Additionally, there has been little use of sensitive cognitive measures, covering multiple, specific cognitive domains. Finally, also lacking in the current literature is investigation into the possible mechanisms by which the observed improvements in cognition through diet and exercise, either individually or in combination, may be being achieved.",92a3e0c6-f3dd-40b7-a022-2dcb7c6271ba
40,methods40," The current trial aims to use clinical trial methodology to test the hypothesis that both Mediterranean diet and walking based aerobic exercise, both independently and in combination, will improve cognitive performance in older people living independently in aged care facilities. Additionally, through blood biomarker, cardiovascular and psychological assessments, this study aims to investigate possible mechanisms by which such improvements may be being achieved. The potential to ameliorate the rate of cognitive decline in older people through achievable lifestyle change may be of substantial importance to public health in an increasingly ageing society.",64da3d7d-9a02-4816-a344-ba1d6115483c
