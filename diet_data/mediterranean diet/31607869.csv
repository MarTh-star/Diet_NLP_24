0,introduction0,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy and cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide (1). Triple negative breast cancer (Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC)) refers to a heterogeneous subclassification of breast tumors that by definition lack expression of the estrogen receptor (ER)α, progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2. These tumors account for ~15% of breast cancer cases and are more likely to occur in women that are young, obese (2), from African-American or Hispanic descent (3), or harbor germline BRCA1 mutations (4). Triple negative breast cancers carry a worse prognosis than hormone receptor-positive (luminal A and luminal B) and HER2-enriched (HER2+) breast tumors (5). For Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), the 5y survival rate for stage I patients is ≥85% compared with ≥99 and ≥94% for luminal (A and B) and HER2+ breast cancer, respectively.",2f1ea12f-fc89-4f8f-b29f-b9ed602b27b1
1,introduction1," Whereas, in the metastatic setting, the median survival for Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) is ~10–13 mo compared to ~5 y for non-Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC).  Poor prognosis of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) is due in part to an incomplete understanding of its molecular etiology and thus reliance on non-targeted chemotherapy for treatment. Moreover, compared with the other molecular subtypes of breast cancer, Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) have an increased tendency for visceral and central nervous system metastases (6, 7) and carry a higher risk of relapse and distant recurrence (8, 9). Optimal chemotherapy regimens for Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) remain elusive, although some benefit has been observed in clinical trials with neoadjuvant platinum-based therapeutics and adjuvant use of paclitaxel (2).",b06ba3ef-03db-42fb-a2d9-3071dd538c28
2,introduction2," Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)) inhibitors have also shown promise against metastatic BRCA-mutated HER2-negative breast tumors (10). Despite these advances, the development of interventional approaches that suppress the initiation and progression of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) and have minimal side effects would be of great benefit.  Diet is implicated as a non-genetic risk effector in breast cancer etiology that can have both beneficial and deleterious influences (11). Moreover, cancer prevention by dietary bioactive components is of great interest as these compounds are cost effective and safe in addition to having anti-tumorigenic properties (12). The Mediterranean Diet (MD) describes the dietary patterns of cultures that have surrounded the Mediterranean sea for millennia (13). There is no absolute definition of what constitutes a MD, however it is generally accepted to be a diet that (1) is rich in plant-based foods (i.e.",aebbd541-39a7-464e-8e8f-932a10d56fdf
3,introduction3,", vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, etc.); (2) uses olive oil as the principle fat source; (3) has low intakes of red and processed meat, saturated fat, and refined sugars; (4) advocates low-to-moderate intake of low-fat dairy and moderate consumption of fish; and (5) emphasizes moderate intake of alcohol (mostly red wine) with meals (14). Several scoring systems have been derived in order to quantitate MD adherence in the context of studying health outcomes (15–17) (Table 1). Adherence to the MD has been demonstrated to be inversely associated with multiple health maladies including cardiovascular disease (18), diabetes (19), Alzheimer's disease (20), and cancer (21).

With respect to breast cancer, both clinical trials (22) and epidemiological studies (23, 24) have suggested a protective influence of MD adherence (Table 2). The PREDIMED study was a multicenter randomized primary prevention trial comparing the effect of following a MD against a low-fat diet (control) on breast cancer incidence in women (n = 4,282, 60–80 y) at high cardiovascular disease risk (22). In fully adjusted models, a group adhering to a MD rich in extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) had significantly less overall breast cancer cases compared with the control group (HR = 0.32, 95%CI: 0.13–0.79). Meta-analyses investigating the association between MD adherence and BC incidence have reported either modest changes in risk ratio (RR = 0.93–0.",9450d6c5-7685-4a43-b57b-ddce6dae3b7e

However, of the latter studies, one (26) found significant risk reductions for ER- tumors (RR = 0.84) upon subgroup stratification, whereas no associations were found for total breast cancer or ER+ breast cancer.

To date, no meta-analysis has investigated the association between MD adherence and Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) incidence specifically. However, individual observational studies (i.e., not meta-analyses) suggest a potential inverse relationship (Table 2). A cohort study using data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the Dutch Pathology Registry reported an inverse association between higher adherence to the alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMED) and incidence of ER- breast cancer. Less significant inverse associations were also found for PR- and ER-/PR- tumors. However, no associations were found for ER+, PR+ or ER+/PR+ tumors (26).",26be3fe4-2655-4915-9262-7eb5c911ec05
8,introduction10," In a subgroup analysis of data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort (EPIC)) study, authors found adherence to the adapted relative Mediterranean diet (arMED) index was associated with decreased odds of ER-/PR- tumors in post-menopausal women (17). A case-control study using cases from the Spanish GEICAM Breast Cancer Research Group reported lower odds of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) incidence with adherence to both an “a priori” and “a posteriori” MD pattern (27). A more recent case-control study in the Spanish population did not find a statistical significance (P-trend = 0.322) in the lower odds ratio calculated for Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) incidence, however authors suggested this was likely due to a small number of cases (n = 76) (28).

9,introduction11," women with a family history of breast cancer (n = 33) suggested higher MD adherence trended toward a risk reduction of 34%, although the trend was not statistically significant (p = 0.07), perhaps due to small sample size (29).  With respect to mortality, one study has reported an inverse relationship between following a MD and non-BC related death (RR = 0.39), although no association was found for breast cancer-specific mortality (30). To our knowledge, no studies have investigated specifically the effect of MD adherence on Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) mortality. However, given the observation that the MD has a more distinct relationship with hormone receptor-negative breast tumor incidence, the capacity to detect an effect of MD adherence on Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) outcomes may be lost in non-stratified analyses of breast cancer cases.",16451130-ada2-4f51-89c6-0e57cf23c99c
10,introduction12," Results from the PREDIMED trial and subgroup analyses in epidemiological studies implicate the protective effect of the MD against breast cancer incidence is attributable in part to higher intakes of olive oil and fish/fish oil (31–33). Moreover, preclinical studies have documented protective effects of both olive (34–36) and fish oil (37–39) in rodent mammary tumor models. Given the inverse association between higher consumption of fish and olive oil and breast cancer incidence, the purpose of this article was to review studies that investigated the effects of olive oil, fish oil and their components on model systems of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC).

15,methods4,"  Fish Oil and Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC): Review Effects on Proliferation and Growth The tumor suppressive effects of fish oil ω-3 essential fatty acids on Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells are summarized in Figure 2. Several studies documented anti-proliferative effects of both docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in preclinical models of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) (41–46). Some suggest the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may be stronger than that of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (41, 44). For example, in MDA-MB-231 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment for 24 h decreased cell viability at a range of concentrations starting at 5 μM (20% growth inhibition) up to 50 μM (85% growth inhibition) (41).",f69834ec-df50-4c1a-b880-7a066eeeb880
16,methods5," On the other hand, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) did not produce a significant reduction until 25 μM (~15% growth inhibition) and only 60% growth inhibition was observed at the highest dose (50 μM). Both compounds had a slight anti-proliferative effect in T47D luminal breast cancer cells, however the maximal effect was only ~40% growth inhibition by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at 50 μM. Another study reported the 24 h half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for cell viability was ~130 μM for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and ~160 μM for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in MDA-MB-231 cells, and ~120 μM for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and ~180 μM for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in MCF7 luminal breast cancer cells (44).",e294f3ab-cd94-4c90-856e-ba3f3a23f034
17,methods6," On the other hand, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) seemed to have similar anti-proliferative efficacy in a study that documented an ~25% decrease in the number of MCF7 (luminal A), SK-BR-3 (HER2+), MDA-MB-231 (Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC)) and HCC1806 (Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC)) cells treated with either eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (80 μM) for 72 h (42). Notably, 160 μM of either compound decreased MDA-MB-231 cell count by ~75% and approached 100% cytotoxic efficiency against the HCC1806 cell line.  Figure 2 The tumor suppressive effects of fish oil ω-3 essential fatty acids in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells.

18,methods7," Mechanistic studies with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) showed pro-apoptotic and pro-pyroptotic effects, with inhibitory effects on glycolytic and mitochondrial energy metabolism. docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) showed suppressive effects on Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell migration and invasion, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) decreased experimental metastasis. Arrows indicate stimulus, blunted lines indicate repressive effects. docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), docosahexaenoic acid; eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), eicosapentaenoic acid.  Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (10–25 μM) lead to an accumulation of the subG1 cell population with concomitant increases in Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and caspase-3 activity (41).",23c52101-b2b0-4112-8fbd-4c28da74b375
19,methods8," Moreover, flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining indicated docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) promoted apoptotic cell death in both MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells (42). Interestingly, one study found co-treatment with vitamin D3 enhanced the pro-apoptotic effect of both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in MCF7, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-231 cells (46).  In addition to apoptosis, one study (43) showed docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may also trigger Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell death through induction of pyroptosis, a cell death program distinct from apoptosis that is triggered by inflammatory signaling and mediated by inflammasomes (76). Here, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment had a cytotoxic effect on MDA-MB-231 cells with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 101.6 μM (43).",63c58e2a-cbbb-4e6f-af99-8e9883379a7f
20,methods9," Intriguingly, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment had no effect on the viability of non-malignant MCF10A mammary cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Pyroptosis is initiated by activation of Caspase-1, which proteolytically cleaves interleukin (IL)-1β and gasdermin D (gasdermin D (GSDMD)) to their active forms (77, 78). The latter molecule, gasdermin D (GSDMD), forms membrane pores, which ultimately triggers pyroptotic cell death. Indeed, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had higher levels of activated Caspase-1 and gasdermin D (GSDMD), enhanced IL-1β secretion, and other markers of pyroptotic cell death (43).  Changes in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell proliferation and growth resultant from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment may also be related to modulation of cell metabolism and bioenergetics.",e1ffc679-2b51-47be-b920-bddb28a91b63
21,methods10," Treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) dose-dependently decreased both glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism in both BT-474 and MDA-MB-231 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells, however no effect was observed in the non-malignant MCF10A cell line (47). These specific effects in the Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells were linked to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-mediated decreases in hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1)α, a key regulator of glycolytic metabolism and the Warburg effect in cancer cells (79). Moreover, in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) decreased HIF1α transcriptional activity and expression of its targets glucose transporter 1 (GLUT 1) and lactate dehydrogenase (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)), which are key mediators of glycolytic metabolism in cancer cells (47).",ceec01c3-d41c-443f-93cb-bd2587beef97
22,methods11,"  A greater anti-proliferative effect on MDA-MB-231 cells was observed with the endocannabinoid derivatives of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoyl-ethanolamine (docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA)) and eicosapentaenoyl-ethanolamine (eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA)), compared to the parent compounds (44). In these experiments the IC50 for cell viability was ~130 μM for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) after both 24 and 48 h; ~80 μM and ~130 μM for docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA) at 24 and 48 h, respectively; ~160 μM for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) after 24 and 48 h; and ~80 μM and ~50 μM for eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA) at 24 and 48 h respectively. Changes in proliferation induced by the ω-3 compounds were shown to be regulated by the endocannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2.",aa4845fb-e309-4ae6-adf6-f733019a7ea1
23,methods12," Co-treating cells with an antagonist specific to CB1 decreased the anti-proliferative effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA) and completely ablated the effects of docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA), but increased eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) efficacy. On the other hand, a CB2-specific antagonist increased the efficacy of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA) but decreased the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA). The effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA) was also increased by antagonizing both CB1 and CB2 in co-treatment experiments, whereas dual antagonism attenuated the efficacy of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA). Of note, this study also documented that none of the compounds tested had an effect on viability of the non-malignant MCF10A cell line.",dfe5fe59-f11c-416f-9207-286832028929
24,methods13,"  There may be cell-specific and metabolite-specific effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on BC cell proliferation. For example, treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (100 μM for 96 h) significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell proliferation by ~85% compared to controls, whereas no statistically significant effect was observed in BT-549 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells (45). On the other hand, 4-OXO-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an oxidized docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) metabolite, had a more potent anti-proliferative effect in MDA-MB-231 cells and decreased BT-549 proliferation by ~85% compared to control cells. In luminal breast cancer cells, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 4-OXO-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) increased MCF7 cell proliferation, whereas both metabolites decreased proliferation of T47D and SK-BR-3 cells.",1e27a922-6b23-4a5d-97bb-72a93ccfcfba
25,methods14," Interestingly, this study suggests different BC subtypes, and even different tumors of the same subtype, may have differential responses to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). However, other studies showed docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) had similar IC50 values against cell viability in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (44).  Gene expression analyses have been used to stratify Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) into multiple subtypes. For example, Lehmann et al. have proposed four Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) tumor specific subtypes referred to as basal like (BL)1, BL2, mesenchymal and luminal androgen receptor (luminal androgen receptor (LAR)) (80).",e86eeba3-cb43-4197-9212-468394703390
26,methods15," Basal-like tumors that are triple negative and have low expression of luminal differentiation markers, high expression of genes involved with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)) and immune response, and are enriched with cancer stem cells are referred to as claudin-low (CL) Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) (81). One study demonstrated supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)+docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (0.025%) significantly decreased growth of models of both claudin low (CL) and basal-like (BL) murine mammary tumors in mice fed an obesogenic diet (60% fat) (48). Mice were orthotopically injected with BL or CL cells derived from murine MMTV-Wnt-1 tumors. Compared with mice fed only the obesogenic diet, mice that received the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)+docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplement had significantly less tumor area and weight.",c6b916fd-e534-4322-8e2a-09b2a1ca9e87
27,methods16," Analysis of tumors showed the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)+docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplement increased the level of cleaved caspase-3 compared to controls and attenuated upregulation of inflammation markers such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and phospho-p65, the major subunit for NF-kB (48).  In Fat-1 mice, the tumor volume orthotopic EO771 cell xenografts was decreased by ~80%, which was associated with decreased NF-κB binding affinity, compared to wildtype (WT) controls (41). Fat-1 carry a transgene for Caenorhabditis elegans ω3 desaturase (fat-1 gene), which causes them to produce high amounts of endogenous ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) from endogenous ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on tumor NF-kB activity was corroborated by cell culture experiments using MDA-MB-231 cells (41).",d6bc0ce4-cb3e-47a8-84a4-400a6ec3badb
28,methods17," Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (0–50 μM) dose-dependently decreased cell viability, which was associated with an accumulation of the subG1 cell population and concomitant increases in Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and caspase-3 activity. These effects were attributed in part to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-induced decreases in the expression of COX2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and promoter activity of NF-kB.  Effects on Migration, Invasion and Metastasis Compared with the other BC subtypes, Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) have an increased propensity for visceral and central nervous system metastases (6, 7). The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)) is a process whereby epithelial cells lose polarity and cell-cell contacts and increase migratory capacities, which facilitates movement into surrounding tissue (invasion) and seeding in distant locations (82).",7d215678-d9ea-4c62-84ae-e08e43a9a95d
29,methods18," Several studies have documented suppressive effects of fish oil ω-3 fatty acids on epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics including cell migration and invasion, which are key to the metastatic process. Transforming growth factor (TGF)β is a cytokine that promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of epithelial cells (82). In two different Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell lines, MDA-MB-435 and Hs578T, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (25 μM) suppressed transforming growth factor (TGF)β-mediated increases in the expression of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) mediators gremlin (GREM)1, N-cadherin, vimentin, and Slug (49). Stimulation of MDA-MB-435 cells with TGFβ had a pro-migratory effect in wound healing assays that was attenuated by either GREM1 silencing or treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Authors attributed the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in part to inhibition of ERK phosphorylation.",39301fee-bb34-4e04-83b6-01f220e859d8
30,methods19,"  Treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (100 μM for 24 h) also decreased invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in Boyden chamber assays by 60% compared to control cells (50). These effects were abrogated upon co-treatment with siRNA against keratin, type II cytoskeletal 1 (KRT1), which was significantly upregulated upon treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) alone. Downregulation of KRT1 has been shown to occur as human mammary epithelial cells undergo malignant transformation mediated by retroviral addition of Simian Virus 40 Early Region (SV40 ER), exogenous human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), and an activated, oncogenic form of hRAS (hRAS-V12) (83).  The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to be triggered by a variety of factors including Wnt/β-catenin (84), fascin-1 (85), and STAT3 (86) among others.",9235fdd0-3ecf-4d62-99b6-4c7954edae21
31,methods20," The interaction of WNT ligands with their receptors leads to stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, a transcription factor regulating genes involved in proliferation, differentiation/development, and migration (87). Silencing fascin-1 suppresses epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in part through preventing nuclear localization of β-catenin (85). On the other hand, STAT3 promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through upregulation of Twist-1 (86). The Hs578T cell line is a highly migratory model of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) that expresses high levels of fascin-1, β-catenin and STAT3α (51). Treatment of Hs578T cells with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (100 μM for 24 h) significantly decreased their migration in wound healing assays, which was linked to a dose-dependent decrease in fascin-1, β-catenin and STAT3α expression.",7dfe7bfb-5dcd-4167-87cd-9ac9ba9b2d69
32,methods21," Pretreatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was also shown to suppress 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate (TPA))-induced increases in MCF7 cell migration, Wnt-1 protein levels and secretion, and β-catenin expression.  Hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment is associated with an increased risk for metastasis and mortality (88). The cellular response to hypoxia is largely regulated by the activity of the HIF1 and HIF2 transcription factors. Targets of the HIF transcription factors include genes involved in several aspects of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, MMP9, vimentin, and snail 1 and 2 among many others (89). Matrix metalloproteinases facilitate invasion by promoting the degradation of the extracellular matrix and basement membrane (88).",12308ad2-8412-49a4-9f32-0ef4626946f7
33,methods22," On the other hand, vimentin is an intermediate filament protein that promotes cell migration through regulation of microtubules and actomyosin networks (90). Vimentin expression is considered an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker and is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer types (91). Under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (100 μM) decreased migration of MDA-MB-231 cells in wound healing assays (52). This was shown to be associated with increased miR-194 expression and decreased miR-106b, which led to downregulation of vimentin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, and MMP9 and increased talin2. Talins are cytoskeletal proteins that link integrin adhesion proteins with F-actin in cells (92) and depletion of talin2 in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased their migration, invasion and expression of HIF-1α, in part through downregulation of AKT/mTOR signaling (93).",5b40e69e-dd91-437b-9bcf-f92f32531636
34,methods23," Interestingly, previous studies showed docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment inhibited growth of MDA-MB-453 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells in part through inhibition of Akt phosphorylation (94), which may underlie its effect on talin2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (52).  Integrins are transmembrane heterodimer proteins that are formed through combinations of α and β subunits (95). Integrins act as signaling molecules and transducers of mechanical stimuli and have significant roles in cell migration and invasion. Targeting β -containing integrins (e.g., αvβ3) has shown promise in preclinical studies to reverse epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reduce migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and BT549 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells (96). Brown et al. used transwell assays in both the absence and presence of a synthetic basement membrane matrix to assess changes in MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion, respectively (44).",2bbb696e-9db3-4f70-8687-7ab1eda7afd5
35,methods24," Compared to controls, only docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) lowered migratory capacity (~70%), however both docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) decreased invasion by ~70 and ~55%, respectively. Western blotting showed docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells decreased protein levels of the β3 integrin subunit, matrix MMP1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), whereas eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) only affected levels of β3 integrin (44). It has been shown that metastatic Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells have higher expression of MMP1, MMP9, MMP13, and vascular endothelial growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) among several other factors involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (97). While the function of MMP proteins is to degrade the extracellular matrix, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a permeability factor that promotes angiogenesis and cancer cell intravasation (89).",44596a09-08bf-47a1-9c33-7942cf74cfda
36,methods25," Activity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is also needed for lymphatic migration of tumor cells (97).  Sites of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) metastatic seeding include the viscera and central nervous system rather than the bone, which is common in ER-positive breast cancer. Gene expression analyses of cells from BC brain metastases demonstrated COX2 as a key facilitator of cancer cell entry passed the blood-brain-barrier (98). Moreover, high tumor expression of COX2 is associated with worse 5 y survival in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) patients (99). A study in the MDA-MB-231 cell line documented 10 μM treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) produced an ~10-fold decrease in invasion through Matrigel chambers, which was associated with downregulation of MMP2 and MMP9 expression and COX2 promoter activity (41).",2312f787-e236-405a-983f-c1214095ac7a
37,methods26," Treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was also shown to attenuate the dose-dependent induction of MMP2 and MMP9 mediated by either prostaglandin E2 or arachidonic acid. Authors also demonstrated NF-κB signaling was suppressed by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment. Higher activity of NF-κB has been observed in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells (100) and has been shown to promote invasion and metastasis (101). Given the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on MMP2, MMP9, COX2, and NF-κB, authors studied its impact on metastasis by injecting EO771 murine BC cells into the tail veins of wildtype (WT) and Fat-1 mice (41). Experimental metastasis was significantly decreased in Fat-1 mice compared with WT littermates, which was associated with decreased levels of the endothelial marker CD31.",a3360c4f-9e35-486e-8946-0c5f71ae28f5
38,methods27,"  Effects on Therapeutic Response Multiple studies suggested addition of fish oil ω-3 fatty acids may enhance the therapeutic response of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) to standard chemotherapeutics. Docetaxel is a taxane used as a first line therapy in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) (102). In MDA-MB-231 cells, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (30 μM) enhanced the cytotoxic efficacy of docetaxel (53). Moreover, treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) prevented docetaxel-induced increases in membrane localization of PKCε and PKCδ and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt, which are associated with drug resistance (53). Dietary supplementation with fish oil (5% by weight) was also shown to enhance the therapeutic response of N-methylnitrosourea (N methylnitrosourea (NMU))-induced tumors to docetaxel in rats, which was attributed to downregulation of ERK- and Akt-regulated survival pathways. Another study documented addition of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to the diet (3.",c55919ae-e909-4129-85db-c3b5fb2c1f4f
39,methods28,"4%) of two different patient-derived Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) xenograft (patient derived TNBC xenograft (PDX)) mouse models significantly improved the efficacy of docetaxel (54). Here, authors used the MAXF574 patient derived TNBC xenograft (PDX), which is poorly differentiated and well-vascularized and the MAXF401 model, which is moderately differentiated and poorly vascularized. In mice bearing the MAXF574 patient derived TNBC xenograft (PDX) and treated with docetaxel, dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) resulted in a 64% reduction in tumor weight compared to control-fed mice. Similarly, tumor weight was decreased by 34% in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-fed mice bearing the MAXF401 patient derived TNBC xenograft (PDX) treated with docetaxel compared with control-fed animals.",e3bd90c0-5661-4f0e-b0cf-21afa9143555
40,methods29," In both patient derived TNBC xenograft (PDX) models, decreased in tumor volume were attributed to higher expression of the pro-apoptotic factors Ripk1 and Bid; lower expression of the Bcl-2, Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP), and surviving; and induction of cell-cycle arrest.  Doxorubicin is another first-line chemotherapy used in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) (103). Studies showed docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) enhanced the efficacy of doxorubicin in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells and an in vivo mouse model (55). Single agent treatment with either doxorubicin or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (60 μM) decreased MDA-MB-231 cell viability. Compared to control treatment with only doxorubicin, treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and doxorubicin had a stronger effect on cell viability and brought about cell cycle arrest.",20553df9-cc3b-4957-9488-5ffeb6ba6626
41,methods30," These changes were attributed to increased expression of several pro-apoptotic factors, including caspase-10 and caspase-9, and decreased levels of cell-cycle progression proteins, including cyclin B1 and WEE1, in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-treated cells.  Apatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R)2, which has been shown to be upregulated in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) patients (104). Addition of apatinib to the treatment regimen of metastatic Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) patients provided a beneficial outcome in two case reports (105, 106). In MDA-MB-231 cells, single-agent treatment with either apatinib or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) dose-dependently decreased proliferation (56). On the other hand, treatment with different combinations of apatnib + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) formulations showed improved efficacy. The optimal dose was found to be 40.",87a9ee86-6baa-4824-aa65-b7811fdcfc14
42,methods31,"5 μM of apatinib (75% of the single-agent IC50) in combination with 112.5 μM docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (75% of single-agent IC50). Authors reported these effects were due in part to downregulation of Bcl-2 and phosphorylated Akt and increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and BAX (56). Together, these studies demonstrate a potential efficacy for adjuvant docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) treatment regimens.  Olive Oil and Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC): Review Hydroxytyrosol and Oleuropein on Proliferation, Migration and Invasion The effects of olive oil components on Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells are summarized in Table 3. Hydroxytyrosol is a simple phenol found in olive oil at concentrations ranging from 0.71 to 2.7 mg/kg (112). Previous studies had highlighted an anti-tumorigenic potential of hydroxytyrosol due to its capacity to protect against oxidative DNA damage in non-malignant MCF10A breast cells (113).",ce5ba6db-cea2-4b77-afd1-9bf7fca6defb
43,methods32," More recently, hydroxytyrosol was shown to have inhibitory effects on breast cancer stem cell (breast cancer stem cell (BCSC)) self-renewal in a comprehensive investigation using multiple Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell lines (57). Tumor enrichment of breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) has been suggested to play a role in the aggressiveness and poor prognosis associated with Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) (114). Hydroxytyrosol at a range of concentrations (0.5–100 μM) suppressed mammosphere-forming efficiency, a marker of breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) self-renewal, of the Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell lines SUM159PT, BT549, MDA-MB-231, and Hs578T (57). In fact, the 0.5 μM dose was sufficient to suppress mammosphere formation of SUM159PT cells by 40% and the three other Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell lines (BT549, MDA-MB-231, and Hs578T) by 50% after 72 h in culture.",64f83679-216c-4058-99b6-e658d561c95d
44,methods33," Interestingly, treatment with hydroxytyrosol actually increased the size of Hs578T spheres, despite decreasing formation efficiency. Treatment with hydroxytyrosol was also shown to decrease migration of SUM159PT, BT549, and MDA-MB-231 cells, however the effect was less pronounced in SUM159PT cells. In BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells, these effects were observed in parallel with dose-dependent reductions in phosphorylated LRP6, LRP6, and β-catenin by hydroxytyrosol treatment, which suggested suppression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, hydroxytyrosol treatment was shown to inhibit TGFβ/SMAD2/3-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (57).

However, hydroxytyrosol had a more potent effect than oleuropein. Regardless, both compounds inhibited hepatocyte growth factor (hepatocyte growth factor (HGF))-induced migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in a manner similar to rapamycin.",53faf6ae-a1e1-4a02-be84-a43ddbbab158
47,methods36," This was associated with reversal of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced changes in LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, downregulation of Beclin-1 and upregulation of p62, suggesting these olive oil compounds may suppress migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by activating autophagy. The IC50 of oleuropein against cell viability of MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 luminal A BC cells was 36.2 and 95.4 μM for 72 h, respectively, suggesting a much higher sensitivity of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells than ER-positive cells (59). Treatment of MDA-MB-231 with oleuropein also decreased migration, induced apoptosis and led to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)). These changes were linked to the capacity of oleuropein to inhibit nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity.  Oleanolic Acid on Proliferation and Migration Oleanolic acid is a triterpenoid abundant in olive oil (26.71–50.",0241c7b6-2d6c-4094-aa50-058c9bf4bb7b
48,methods37,"13 μg) (75) with previous studies (>5 years prior to this review) that had demonstrated anti-proliferative capacity in both MDA-MB-231 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) and MCF7 luminal A BC cells with respective half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 7.0 and 7.5 μM (107). These anti-proliferative effects were attributed to induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in these cell lines. Since then, multiple derivatives of oleanolic acid have been investigated for their anti-BC potential. Methyl 3-hydroxyimino-11-oxoolean-12-en-28-oate, a synthetic derivative, reduced MDA-MB-231 cell viability with an IC50 of 21.08 μM by activating apoptotic (extrinsic) and autophagic pathways (60). Another oleanolic acid derivative, SZC017, was shown to inhibit cell viability of both MDA-MB-231 (IC50 = 28.09 μM) and MCF7 (IC50 = 26.47 μM) (61).",34e3a953-9cd4-4a26-8c8f-658c4a4b49ae
49,methods38," Unfortunately, authors used only the MCF7 cell line to investigate the mechanisms underlying these effects, which were attributed to apoptotic and autophagic induction in part by decreasing Akt activation and nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated-p65.  This report is somewhat contrasted by another study which demonstrated a cytotoxic effect of oleanolic acid in MDA-MB-231 cells but not MCF7 cells (62). After 24 h in media containing 100 μM oleanolic acid, only 68% of MDA-MB-231 cells survived, whereas there was no statistical decrease in the number of MCF7 cells. However, these differences could be due to the fact that a much higher dose (100 μM) was used in these experiments. In the ER-negative non-malignant MCF10A cell line, oleanolic acid had a cytotoxic effect at both 10 μM (83% cell survival) and 100 μM (13% cell survival) after 24 h in culture.",1ab5ebed-75eb-4257-86e5-54a2abce0be0
50,methods39," Oleanolic acid was also shown to inhibit proliferation in a dose-dependent manner after 24, 48, and 72 h in culture and the decrease in proliferation was significant starting at 1 μM. Similar effects were observed in the MCF10A cells starting at the 10 μM dose, however an anti-proliferative effect was only observed in the MCF7 cells at 100 μM. The anti-proliferative effect in MDA-MB-231 cells was ascribed in part to intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, oleanolic acid also protected against H2O2-induced DNA damage in MCF10A cells (62).  In addition to anti-proliferative effects, oleanolic acid may also have anti migratory potential in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells. Treating MDA-MB-231 cells with oleanolic acid suppressed cell migration with an IC50 of 14.0 μM (63). Moreover, carbamoylation of oleanoic acid to derive 3-O-[N-(30-chlorobenzenesulfonyl)- carbamoyl]-oleanolic acid (IC50 = 2.",02d1d5f3-2e36-45f7-b56f-7287ab4d9c11
51,methods40,"1 μM) and 3-O-[N-(50-fluorobenzenesulfonyl)-carbamoyl]-oleanolic acid (IC50 = 1.4 μM) provided more potent antimigratory effects. Western blot analysis indicated the antimigratory effects of oleanolic acid and its derivatives were linked to inhibition of the breast tumor kinase (BRK)/Paxillin/Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac1) signaling pathway.  Oleic Acid on Proliferation, Migration and Therapeutic Response Oleic acid is the most abundant free fatty acid in olive oil (809.53–1045.52 μg/g) followed by palmitic acid (285.41–362.95 μg/g) (75). Previous studies had documented oleic acid may have a pro-tumorigenic effect on Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). For example, in MDA-MB-231 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells, oleic acid increased proliferation via PI3K activation (108), invasion via (MMP)9 secretion (109) and migration through increased production of arachidonic acid and subsequent activation of focal adhesion kinase (focal adhesion kinase (FAK)) (110).",27d12b5f-32aa-4c09-af61-6a7a1d6eb44e
52,methods41," A recent study demonstrated a 4-fold increase in MDA-MB-231 cell migration by oleic acid (100 μM) was attenuated by concurrent treatment with selective inhibitors for free fatty acid receptor (FFAR)1 and FFAR4, suggesting their involvement in mediating the pro-migratory effect of oleic acid in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells (64). Selective inhibitors of PI3K and AKT also attenuated oleic acid-induced migration of these cells and subsequent experiments revealed this was due to oleic acid-induced phosphorylation of both AKT1 and AKT2. The increase in migration elicited by oleic acid was demonstrated to require AKT2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. Oleic acid also increased the activity of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-μB), a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in invasion, in MDA-MB-231 cells.",5368ff41-efad-4202-ad3a-4dfdd2ce88af
53,methods42," In summary, this study documented critical roles of FFAR, PI3K, AKT, and NF-κB in mediating the pro-invasion/migration effect of oleic acid on Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells.  Cancer-associated fibroblasts have been shown to promote epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics and increase migration of MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 BC cells in culture (115). However, this effect is attenuated by knockdown of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)1, a endoplasmic reticulum desaturase that regulates membrane fluidity via conversion of saturated fatty acids to MUFA (116). Interestingly, treatment of SCD1-knockdown MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells with oleic acid restored CAF-mediated pro-migratory effects in wound-healing assays (65). High expression of SCD1 in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) was associated with increased proportion of metastasis-related deaths (HR = 6.73) (66).",316ea5bb-6984-4111-b514-d8f2ce75ed3f
54,methods43," In wound-healing assays, oleic acid treatment increased wound recovery of MDA-MB-231 and luminal A (T47D and MCF7) by 1.5-fold compared with untreated cells (66). However, wound recovery by oleic acid-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells was attributed to enhanced migration, whereas luminal A cell recovery was due to proliferation. An analysis of migratory dynamics revealed oleic acid increased the speed and changed the directionality of MDA-MB-231 cell migration. These changes were linked to oleic acid-mediated activation of a phospholipase D (PLD)/mTOR signaling pathway. In line with this, treating MDA-MB-231 with rapamycin attenuated oleic acid-induced (250 μM) proliferation, invasion and migration (67). This was accredited to inhibitory effects of oleic acid and activating effects of rapamycin on autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells.  Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy that demonstrated efficacy as a first-line chemotherapy in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) patients (117).",9f5e0070-8679-4cef-b301-bbb173121b48
55,methods44," However, multiple mechanisms of cisplatin-resistance have been identified in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells (118). Despite the potential deleterious effects of oleic acid on Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells, one study demonstrated a potential synergistic relationship between oleate and Cisplatin on inducing apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells (68). Treatment with oleate (50 μM) increased the number of cells undergoing apoptosis when used in combination with Cisplatin compared to cells treated with Cisplatin alone, which was attributed to oleic acid-dependent downregulation of fatty acid synthase (fatty acid synthase (FASN)). Previous studies had also demonstrated oleic acid enhanced the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells and T47D and MCF7 luminal A cells to the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel (119).",434e77fb-b3bb-43c2-b45e-9e61d97a5ef5
56,methods45," Although it has not been tested, there may be a potential role for oleic acid in modulating Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) therapeutic response.  Oleocanthal on Proliferation, Migration and Invasion Oleocanthal is a secoiridoid present in olive oil that was previously shown to inhibit proliferation (20 μM), migration (10 μM), and invasion (10 μM) of MDA-MB-231 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells in vitro (111). These effects were attributed to suppression of MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Met) signaling, a pro-carcinogenic factor upregulated in ~43% of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) samples (120). A follow up study demonstrated oleocanthal had a pro-apoptotic effect in these cells and stabilized a more epithelial, rather than mesenchymal, phenotype (69). In mice, (-)-oleocanthal (5 mg/kg) administered via intraperitoneal injection (3X/week) reduced MDA-MB-231 triple-negative xenograft tumor volume by 60% compared to vehicle-treated controls.",d8859620-605d-42d5-8514-011ce24960a4
57,methods46," These in vivo outcomes at this dose were attributed to inhibition of c-MET and cytostatic effects rather than a pro-apoptotic influence. Interestingly, the tumor suppressive effects of oleocanthal may be selective to malignant cells. For example, one study showed that (-)-oleocanthal (10–20 μM over 24–72 h) decreased cell viability, proliferation and migration of MDA-MB-231 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells and MCF7 luminal A BC cells in culture, but had no effect on non-malignant MCF10A cells (70). These differences in effect were linked to downregulation of the Ca2+ channel transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 6 (TRPC6), which is overexpressed by the BC cell lines. Previous studies showed silencing TRPC6 decreased proliferation and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells (121).  Another study tested the effect of oral oleocanthal exposure on a xenograft model of breast tumor recurrence (71).",1b7efc7c-a4e4-4d27-9a8c-29b0719914eb
58,methods47," These experiments demonstrated the capacity of oral oleocanthal (10 mg/kg daily) to reduce the growth of recurrent MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors by 58%, which was associated with lower serum levels of cancer antigen (CA)15-3 (71), a tumor marker of post-operative recurrence and metastasis risk (122). Tumors from oleocanthal-treated mice also had decreased phosphorylated c-MET, increased in E-cadherin and downregulation of vimentin (71). A taste-masked oleocanthal formulation using (+)-xylitol as an inert carrier was developed to improve palatability of oral oleocanthal administration (72). Daily oral administration of this formulation (10 mg/kg) to athymic nude mice starting 45 days before orthotopic inoculation of MDA-MB-231 cells decreased mean tumor volume by 49% compared with control mice. This same dose (10 mg/kg) was also shown to decrease MDA-MB-231 tumor volume by 48% when administered to mice 5 days after xenograft inoculation.",df3bf464-c3ba-423e-a1e1-3806d33ba237
59,methods48," Mice that received this xylitol-oleocanthal formula after surgical resection of MDA-MB-231 tumors also had extended recurrence-free survival, 60% recurrence prevention, and significantly decreased volume of recurred tumors compared with placebo-treated mice. Again, inhibitory effects on tumor growth were attributed to antagonism toward c-MET.  Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in cell survival, growth and proliferation. Activity of mTOR is increased via multiple mitogenic signals, namely phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT) signaling (123). As is the case for most cancers, aberrations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are common in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) (124).",bc9cc118-f650-4564-8d9b-19979ad38f38
60,methods49," Molecular modeling studies documented oleocanthal shared with a dual inhibitor of mTOR and PI3K, 9/10 critical binding interactions with mTOR and in vitro kinase assays found the IC50 for oleocanthal against mTOR activity to be 708 nM (73). In cell culture studies, oleocanthal had strong anti-proliferative effects in MDA-MB-231 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells (IC50 = 18.5 μM) and T47D (IC50 = 20.0 μM) and MCF7 (28.0 μM) luminal A cells. Western blotting revealed these effects were linked with decreased phosphorylation (activation) of mTOR in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with oleocanthal.  Pinoresinol on Proliferation Pinoresinol is a lignan found in olive oil (0.07–0.9 mg/kg) (125) that is considered a phytoestrogen due to its similar chemical structure to estrogen. Previous studies had demonstrated pinoresinol (100 μM) had anti-proliferative effects on MDA-MB-231 cells (70 ± 6% cell survival) but not MCF7 cells (96 ± 7% cell survival) (126).",9beba9af-1a27-41f9-894c-1edb16008e08
61,methods50," Recently, pinoresinol treatment was shown to have cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB-231 cells at concentrations ranging from 0.001–100 μM, whereas only low levels (0.001–0.01 μM) were cytotoxic to MCF7 cells (74). Interestingly, the cytotoxic effect of pinoresinol may be specific to tumorigenic cells. This was evidenced by the fact that none of the treatment doses (0.001–0.01 μM) led to >10% cell death in the non-malignant MCF10A cell line. Moreover, the amount of MCF10A cell death with the 0.001 and 0.01 μM pinoresinol treatment was statistically lower than that of MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells at those doses. Further investigation revealed an anti-proliferative effect of pinoresinol in the BC cell lines that was associated with a pro-oxidant effect. On the other hand, in the non-tumorigenic cell line pinoresinol had an antioxidant effect, which reduced cellular oxidative stress and H2O2-induced DNA damage. ",1d74c2ce-afb6-4cc5-9498-4acabf9bd103
62,discussion0,"Triple negative breast cancers are the most aggressive and lethal of the BC molecular subtypes. Although there have been advances in chemotherapeutic regimens for Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) (2), there is a potential benefit to identifying lifestyle interventions that target molecular effectors of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) initiation and progression. The diet is a key example of a modifiable risk effector that influences a myriad of molecular processes with both positive and negative implications toward mammary tumorigenesis. In both clinical trial (22) and meta-analysis (21, 23, 24), adherence to the MD has been shown to be inversely associated with BC development. Stratified analyses in observational studies identified this relationship to be a more distinct for ER-negative breast cancers in particular (26).",d460f92e-defd-4f51-9420-df4d7e94aaff
63,discussion1," Although no meta-analysis has specifically analyzed MD adherence and Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) incidence, individual observational studies have reported an inverse relationship (27). With this in mind, we sought to review the recent evidence regarding an effect of two principle components of the MD, fish and olive oil, on model systems of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) to gain perspective on the role of a MD to aid in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) prevention and prognosis.  Components of both fish and olive oil demonstrated antagonistic effects toward several cancer hallmarks in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells. Both ω-3 essential fatty acids of fish oil, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), had anti-proliferative effects against two different Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806, in cell culture experiments (42).",934f38ec-8338-447e-a2a3-3edda871cd3c
64,discussion2," Moreover, in mice, a diet supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) suppressed tumorigenesis of two different mouse-derived Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) xenograft tumor models (48). Several components of olive oil were also shown to have anti-proliferative effects against Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells including hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein (58), oleanolic acid (107), oleocanthal (111), and pinoresinol (74). Oleocanthal, also inhibited Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell invasion in cell culture experiments (111) and suppressed the formation of primary (69) and recurrent (71) MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor formation when administered to mice.  Cell proliferation and viability can be decreased through multiple mechanisms including induction of cell death programs (e.g., apoptosis and pyroptosis), suppression of upregulated growth signaling and cell-cycle arrest.",578a503f-036c-4f6f-8661-c540bd84730c
65,discussion3," Both docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were shown to activate apoptosis (42) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) activated pyroptosis (43) and modulated cellular energetics (47) in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells. The anti-proliferative effects of oleuropein (59), oleanolic acid (107), and oleocanthal (69) were also linked to apoptotic induction. On the other hand, hydroxytyrosol and its ester oleuropein were suggested to activate autophagy (58). An attractive aspect of the anti-proliferative effect of several of the components of the MD oils including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (43, 44), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (44), oleocanthal (70), and pinoresinol (74, 125), is their apparent selectivity toward malignant cells. In these experiments that documented inhibitory effects of these compounds on proliferation of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells, no effect was observed in the non-malignant MCF10A cell line.",c2c8752b-55b8-4817-b3ef-2eb0eac28f47
66,discussion4," It is important to note, the vast majority of studies we reviewed did not include non-malignant control cell lines in their experiments, so one could expect more than just the aforementioned bioactives (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), oleocanthal, pinoresinol) elicit this selective effect.  Activating the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and progressing through the metastatic process is a key determinant of BC prognosis as the median survival rate for metastatic Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) is ~10–13 mo (5). In addition to proliferation, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was shown to inhibit migration (44, 49, 51, 52) and invasion (41, 44, 50) of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) in culture. Mouse experiments using the tail vein injection model in Fat-1 mice, which produce higher amounts of endogenous ω-3 essential fatty acids, also suggested a potential anti-metastatic effect (41).",0e2429c1-1cd6-4ecc-b250-5339a78a58af
67,discussion5," However, these experiments did not use a human derived Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell line nor an exogenous source of ω-3, which would more resemble exposure to a MD pattern. The olive oil polyphenol hydroxytyrosol also produced an anti-migratory effect in SUM159PT, BT549, and MDA-MB-231 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells and in this same study decreased breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) self-renewal in 3D mammospheres (57). Both hydroxytyrosol and its ester oleuropein also inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell invasion (58). An anti-migratory effect was also produced by treating MDA-MB-231 cells with oleanolic acid (63) and oleocanthal (111). Oleocanthal was also anti-invasive against MDA-MB-231 cells (111).  Despite these potential benefits, we would be remiss to not discuss the deleterious effects observed with treatment of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells with oleic acid, the principle fatty acid in olive oil.",bc1274e5-e9bd-48c2-912b-0c367879be2f
68,discussion6," The evidence reviewed here suggests oleic acid alone may increase Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell proliferation (108), migration (110), and invasion (109). However, in the context of the MD, oleic acid exposure would occur along with a cocktail of several other dietary components that may abrogate its negative effect. Studies showed inhibitors of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR attenuated oleic acid-induced increases in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (64, 67) and the MD oils alone contain several components that antagonize the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. For example, oleocanthal was shown to be an inhibitor of both PI3K and mTOR (73) and both docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (94) and oleanolic acid (61) inhibited AKT. Thus, there is a strong potential that the pro-tumorigenic effect of oleic acid on Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) is blunted when delivered as complete olive oil or in the context of a MD.",1f0f7394-b50e-4124-b363-f87abc6d328a
69,discussion7,"  Aberrations in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling are common in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) and some have suggested this pathway as a therapeutic target (124). Signaling through PI3K/AKT/mTOR influences several cellular processes including proliferation, invasion, survival, metabolism, and chemoresistance and has been shown to play a role in the initiation and progression of mammary tumorigenesis (124, 127, 128). The above example of multiple compounds in the MD inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway highlights a significant benefit of using a MD-based approach to aid in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) prevention and therapy. In addition to PI3K/AKT/mTOR, both NF-κB/COX2 and Wnt/β-catenin are also targeted by components from either fish or olive oil (Figure 3).  Figure 3 Signaling pathways in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) targeted by multiple components of the MD oils. Signaling through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway facilitates cell proliferation, invasion, and survival.",32de9c68-fe1c-4fbf-aaa8-4216d104c334
70,discussion8," Growth factor receptors (e.g., insulin receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptors) activate PI3K, which activates Akt and subsequently mTOR. Components from the MD shown to have inhibitory effects on this pathway include docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from fish oil in addition to oleocanthal and oleanolic acid from olive oil. COX2 is involved in BC initiation, inflammation, invasion and metastasis. Under basal conditions NF-κB (p65 and p50) is sequestered in the cytosol by inhibitor of κB (IκB) proteins. Activation of inflammatory cytokine receptors (e.g., tumor necrosis factor (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)) receptor) activates inhibitory κB kinase (inhibitory κB kinase (IKK)) complexes, which phosphorylate IκB proteins for degradation leading to stabilization and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. In the nucleus, NF-κB activates a myriad of target genes, such as Ptgs2, the gene encoding the COX2 protein.",cc7a7bb9-7a39-4a5c-a95a-168f0e589baa
71,discussion9," MD components that inhibit this signaling pathway include the fish oil ω-3 fatty acids in addition to oleuropein, oleanolic acid and oleocanthal from olive oil. Finally, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway increases Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell proliferation, migration and chemoresistance. Under normal conditions, β-catenin is sequestered and degraded in the cytosol by a destruction complex containing axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3)β and casein kinase (CK1). Interaction of Wnt ligands with receptor complexes (e.g., low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)5/LRP6/frizzled) leads to dissociation of β-catenin from the destruction complex, which leads to its stabilization and nuclear accumulation. Both docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from fish oil and hydroxytyrosol from olive oil have inhibitory effects on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.",0d83337e-4125-42ed-a0b0-b866a23d1bbd
72,discussion10,"  Studies have suggested higher expression of COX2 is associated with worse prognosis in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) patients (99), BC brain metastasis (98), and tumor inflammation (129). Moreover, COX-2 has been implicated to play a role in BC initiation and invasion (129, 130). Expression of COX2 is induced by NF-κB (131), which is activated by interleukin (IL) receptors, tumor necrosis factor (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)) receptors, toll like receptors (toll like receptors (TLR)), and other inflammatory signals (132). In mice bearing CL and BL triple-negative xenografts, a diet enriched with both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) decreased tumor expression of COX2 and phospho-p65, the major subunit for NF-kB (48). Activity of NF-κB was also suppressed in tumors of Fat-1 mice bearing EO771 cell xenografts compared wildtype littermates (41).",54030f65-093e-4496-a624-e9c88f1682cc
73,discussion11," Treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) also decreased NF-κB activity and COX2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (41). The olive oil phenol oleuropein was also shown to decrease NF-κB activity and COX2 levels in MDA-MB-231 cells (59). Oleanolic acid also decreased nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated-p65 (61). Stromal overexpression of COX2 has also been shown to be an independent indicator of worse overall survival in breast cancer (133). Oleocanthal has demonstrated the capacity to downregulate expression of COX2 and activity of NF-kB in adipocytes (134). Given that the breast stroma is largely populated by adipocytes, this collective evidence suggests the MD could facilitate an intra- and extra-tumoral environment that suppresses the NF-κB/COX2 pathway.  Aberrations in the Wnt signaling pathway are common in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) [Reviewed here (135)].",fcb18c1c-742a-4fc4-9954-a09d58279142
74,discussion12," Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway stabilizes the transcription factor ω-catenin, which leads to its accumulation and subsequent nuclear translocation (136). ω-catenin controls multiple genes involved in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation/development, and migration (87). Upregulated Wnt/β-catenin confers increased migratory capacity, colony formation, stemness, and chemoresistance of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells in cell culture and tumor formation of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) xenografts in mouse models (137). Interestingly, studies of BC patients have shown nuclear accumulation of ω-catenin in tumors is associated with the Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) phenotype (138) and upregulated Wnt/β-catenin predicts poor prognosis for Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) (139). In two studies, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had suppressive effects on Wnt/β-catenin-mediated tumorigenicity.",4caeb79b-b518-458a-a389-39b695fa22da
75,discussion13," Mice fed a diet enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)+docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (0.025%) showed a decreased tumor burden from MMTV-Wnt-1 xenografts compared to control-fed littermates (48). In cell culture experiments, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) dose-dependently decreased expression of ω-catenin in Hs578T Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells and attenuated tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate (TPA)-induced increases in Wnt-1 levels and secretion and ω-catenin expression in MCF7 cells (51). On the other hand, the olive oil phenol hydroxytyrosol suppressed breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) renewal and mammosphere formation in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 in part through inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.",3f363e85-eddc-407c-b7ff-8a387b492e09
76,discussion14,"  A perplexing question that emerges when examining epidemiological studies investigating the association between MD adherence and BC incidence is: why is there a distinct relationship for ER-negative breast cancers in particular? For example, a meta-analysis suggested the risks for ER- (RR = 0.60), PR- (RR = 0.72), and ER-/PR- (RR = 0.61) BC were significantly decreased with higher adherence to a MD, whereas no associations were found for ER+, PR+, or ER+/PR+ tumors (26). This could be explained in part by the fact that some of the studies we reviewed demonstrated several MD compounds imparted differential effects on proliferation of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells compared to non-Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells. For example, at 50 μM, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) produced 85% growth inhibition of MDA-MB-231 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells compared to only 40% inhibition of T47D luminal breast cancer cell growth (41).",27423d42-aa71-4ab1-aad3-7b767cb75f6a
77,discussion15," Another study actually documented a pro-proliferative effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in MCF7 luminal cells (45). The olive oil compound oleuropein was shown to have a stronger anti-proliferative effect against MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50 = 36.2 μM) compared to MCF7 cells (95.4 μM) (59). Whereas, oleanolic acid treatment was cytotoxic against MDA-MB-231 cells but had no effect on MCF7 cell proliferation (62). The MDA-MB-231 cell line was also more sensitive than MCF7 cells to the cytotoxic effects of pinoresinol (74). Studies have demonstrated both overexpression of COX2 (140) and nuclear accumulation of ω-catenin (138) are associated with the Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) subtype.",51eb2eb1-e2d6-4fbb-9e9a-8cb1ff6b7097
78,discussion16," Given that MD components covered in this review showed antagonistic effects on both COX2 and ω-catenin, another explanation for an inverse relationship between MD adherence and ER-negative breast cancers could be the specific molecular targets of the MD in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) and HER2+ cells. The molecular effects of the MD diet and its constituents on HER2+ breast cancer was outside the scope of this review. However, there is significant evidence to suggest oleic acid and olive oil inhibit HER2+ tumorigenesis and may have therapeutic potential in these cancers [Reviewed here (141)].  Of the studies reviewed here, we identified a general lack of accountability for the heterogeneity of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). As exemplified by Lehmann et al., Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) can be clustered into several distinct subtypes, which are heterogeneous with respect to clinical parameters such as prognoses and response to therapy (80).",6a444151-13b7-40fa-bace-d11db4a6c76c
79,discussion17," The majority of studies we reviewed that performed cell culture experiments used only one Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell line. The most widely used Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell line was the MDA-MB-231 cell line. In addition to the different effects observed between Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) and non-Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) treated with MD components, there may be differential outcomes for different Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) subtypes. We highlighted an example of this with study investigating docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (45). For MDA-MB-231 cells, 100 μM decreased proliferation by 85% compared to controls, whereas no changes were seen in BT-549 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell proliferation (45). Moreover, the HCC1806 Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cell line was more sensitive to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment than MDA-MB-231 cells in a different study (42).",3367d1d7-0785-4cec-bd83-923d0c0b2885
80,discussion18," These differences could be resultant from distinct genetic and molecular features of these cell lines. For example, the MDA-MB-231 cell line has been characterized as mesenchymal stem-like, whereas BT-549 and HCC1806 are considered mesenchymal-like and basal-like 2, respectively (142). BT-549 cells have been shown to harbor a homozygous PTEN deletion, whereas both MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806 have been reported to not have aberrations in the PI3K pathway (40). On the other hand, MDA-MB-231 cells are also reported to have mutations in KRAS. Another consideration is the fact that the majority of BRCA1-mutated tumors (~70%) are Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) (4), however the MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and HCC1806 cell lines all harbor wildtype BRCA1 genes (40). This highlights the need for studies looking to impact Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) prevention and therapy to utilize model systems of Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) that account for heterogeneity.",a8a44c4c-c285-4a8c-8712-9ee40d7d78a6
81,discussion19,"  The question as to whether or not the MD deserves a role in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) prevention and therapy remains unclear at this time. Although we highlighted several examples of fish and olive oil components having anti-tumorigenic effects in Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) model systems, more work needs to be done in order to optimize clinical recommendations. For starters, MD guidelines call for more specific dietary changes than just increases fish and olive oil consumption. A potentially significant contributor to the effect of MD adherence on breast cancer risk is higher consumption of vegetables and fruits. Unfortunately, a thorough review of the effects of vegetable and fruit bioactive components on Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) model systems would have exceeded the scope of this current review. However, this is still open for investigation.",c3f2213d-68fa-49a4-b49b-eec4dc45aa41
82,discussion20," Furthermore, the potential pro-tumorigenic effect oleic acid may have on Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) cells demands a careful approach. Although we speculated of a potential entourage effect by delivering oleic acid in the context of a MD, no study has specifically tested if the pro-oncogenic outcomes of oleic acid are abrogated by other MD diet components. This too remains open for investigation.  Author Contributions MD, OS, BS, LN, and DR contributed to the conception and development of the manuscript.
