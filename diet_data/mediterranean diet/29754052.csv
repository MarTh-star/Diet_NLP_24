0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design A cross-sectional study was carried out on a sample of high school adolescents from private and public schools across Mount Lebanon and Beirut. These two main regions were selected because they included approximately half of the Lebanese students according to the report of the Lebanese Central Administration of Statistics [22].  2.2. Sampling Method Data from the Ministry of Education were used to compile a sampling frame of all schools in the studied regions. The schools were randomly selected based on the stratified cluster sampling method, the strata being public and private schools, whereas the clusters were the secondary classes, and the end units were all the students aged between 15 and 18, and willing to participate. 607 adolescents from grades 10 to 12 were selected, but participants with missing information and medical reasons were excluded from the analysis (7 adolescents).  2.3.",90095ca6-4124-4592-8b40-149ba0407046
1,methods1," Ethical Considerations The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964). Before the study started, all school directors and adolescents gave written consent. They were informed about the research objectives and had the right to withdraw from the study at any moment. Before anthropometric measurements were carried out, verbal assent was also obtained from each adolescent. Anonymity and confidentiality of participants were respected. Our study does not expose participants to any risk.  2.4. Questionnaire The questionnaire included 20 questions and was self-administered. The sociodemographic data informed us on the age, nationality, place of residence, work status, and the level of education of the students. The medical history included questions about diseases, medications, or supplements. The socioeconomic status (socioeconomic status (SES)) was based on the type of school.",ef8c139e-864d-4bcc-b7be-d7132d70871e
2,methods2," Lebanese public school students belonged to low socioeconomic status (SES) due to their lower income and lower school expenses compared to the private schools. The lifestyle characteristics involved the practice of three specific levels of physical activity (PA), based on the frequency and duration: low (<60 min/day), moderate (60–90 min/day), and high (>90 min/day) [23].  The school performance of the students was measured by the question: “What has been your average grade during this year?” with the answers varying between lower than 10 and higher than 15 over 20. We considered grades lower than 10 as a low school performance, grades between 10 and 15 as moderate, and grades higher than 15 as a high school performance.",d442ea5c-88c0-4781-8fcf-8ebbfb05b356
3,methods3,"  The assessment of breakfast intake was also evaluated in the questionnaire: by the frequency of intake that was divided into 3 categories: 6–7 days/week; 3–5 days/week; and 0–2 days/week; by the time of intake divided into 2 categories: between 5 am and 10 am, and after 10 am; and finally by the type of foods consumed at breakfast. Subjects that did not consume any food or beverage at breakfast, excluding water, were categorized as breakfast skippers. The types of food choices at breakfast were later on divided into two categories according to the quality of breakfast, as defined by the study of O'Neil et al. [24–26]: a healthy breakfast included three main elements: a cereal food and preferably whole grain products (bread, crackers, ready-to-eat cereals…), a dairy product (milk, yoghurt, cheese…), and a fruit (raw fruit or a fruit juice without added sugar), whereas an unhealthy breakfast included fatty foods and added sugars such as the bakery and confectionary products.  2.5.",6d3a4f8f-b444-414b-82cf-2fd7003376c8
4,methods4," Anthropometric Assessment Anthropometric measurements were carried out by trained dietitians and taken through calibrated equipment. Participants were weighed to the nearest 0.1 kg, barefoot, using a digital body weight scale (Oregon, BW121, China) and height was measured by using a stadiometer. BMI was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms (kg) by the square of height in meters (m) according to the WHO [27], in order to calculate the BMI-for-age percentiles using the CDC growth charts [28]. According to the CDC classifications, students with measures located between the 5th and the 85th percentile are considered to have a normal weight. However, percentiles lower than 5th are considered as underweight, percentiles between 85th and 95th are considered as overweight, and percentiles ≥95th are considered as obese [28].  2.6.",620b5121-991b-4a63-8490-869f3b1d607a
5,methods5," Dietary Assessment Information on dietary intake was gathered by a face-2-face interview with dietitians, through 2 methods: the 24 h-recall and the Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)). Particular attention was paid to the factors that maintain the quality of the reported data, such as the nondirectivity of the survey and the estimation of portion size; the latter was defined for each food item and represented one standard serving expressed in household measures including measuring cups, spoons, and graphical representation of food products.  The 24 h recall was used to assess all the foods and beverages consumed in the 24 hours preceding the interview (which constitutes a typical day of the week), stating their amounts and the methods of preparation. As for the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), it referred to the dietary intake of the previous 6 months and included sixty items of foods and beverages commonly consumed in Lebanon.",9dccef79-3cba-4057-beda-9f79b975b465
6,methods6," The questionnaire was inspired by models already used in Lebanese studies and abroad [29, 30]. Participants were asked to record the frequency of consumption either per day, per week, per month, or never. The data collected from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) were used to assess the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD). This partly open-ended approach for recording frequency of consumption allows more flexibility compared with the multiple-choice frequency approach and contributes to the reduction of misclassification errors [30].  To estimate the daily energy and nutrients intake, as well as the nutrients intake at breakfast, we used the professional nutritional software Nutrilog 3.01 [31] based on the Food Composition Tables for Use in the Middle East [32] and the United States Department of Agriculture (United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)) [33]. Those in whom the estimated energy intake was <500 or >5000 kcal were excluded from analysis.",9d777746-f7dd-49df-87ec-f75a2c40f852
7,methods7," Other nutrients were also taken into consideration in order to properly compare a healthy and an unhealthy breakfast, including fibers, added sugars, and cholesterol intake.  2.7. Assessment of the Mediterranean Dietary Patterns The degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) was assessed using the KIDMED index. It is characterized by a total of 16 questions answered by yes or no: “Do you consume one fruit or fruit juice every day?” “Do you consume a second fruit every day?” “Do you consume fresh or cooked vegetables once a day?” “Do you consume fresh or cooked vegetables more than once a day?” “Do you consume fish at least 2–3 times per week?” “Do you go to a fast food restaurant more than once per week?” “Do you consume pulses more than once per week?” “Do you consume rice or pasta 5 times or more per week?” “Do you consume cereal products (bread, cornflakes, etc.",e74506f2-6151-4183-ad33-44593e5652d0

The KIDMED index ranged from 0 to 12. Subjects with KIDMED scores ≤3 are considered having a poor adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), those with scores between 4 and 7 have a moderate adherence, and those with scores ≥8 have a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) [21].  2.8.",fd6397da-4f4a-4a6c-b5f1-8650dba3eb80
9,methods9," Statistical Analysis Sociodemographic, lifestyle characteristics, eating habits, and anthropometric measurements were evaluated by means and percentages for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. To evaluate the associations between variables, the chi-square test was used for categorical variables and ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis for continuous variables. We further applied linear regression analysis evaluating the association between the levels of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) (as assessed by the KIDMED scores) and the determinants (age, gender, school type, level of education, school grades, BMI percentiles, and breakfast quality). The analyses were performed using the SPSS 21.0 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.  3. Results 3.1. Population Characteristics The final sample considered for this study included 600 adolescents (268 boys and 332 girls), aged between 15 and 18 years old.",1ae97760-1f61-46cd-b447-2b3788fa00fb
10,methods10," The distribution of this sample was equal across schools with 9 public (50%) and private schools (50%) being studied. Only 17.4% of the students reported working after school, and only 13% had a low academic performance (grades < 10). The majority of the adolescents had low (27.3%) or moderate (31%) PA and were of normal weight (68.1%). 8.3% of the students were obese, and 21.6% were overweight.  3.2. Sociodemographic, Lifestyle, Anthropometric Characteristics, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) The associations between KIDMED scores and the participant's characteristics are presented in Table 1. Out of 600 participants, 84.2% of the adolescents had a low (43%) and moderate (41.2%) adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), with significantly higher prevalence rates being noted among girls compared with boys. In fact, the low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) group had a higher percentage of boys (53.",7dbb03a6-3f42-4971-97c8-9f01d091337e

As shown in Table 1, significant differences in index scores were observed between school types. Adolescents from public schools (92.6%) seemed to have a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) than their counterparts (7.4%). Surprisingly, the level of PA in our sample was not significantly associated with the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), and neither was the work status. However, the level of education differed significantly between groups, Table 1 shows that 47.4% of the high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) group belongs to grade 10, while only 18.9% belongs to grade 12.",4c581862-6454-47e2-b03e-c5dd4cf1055a
12,methods12," School grades were also significantly associated with the level of adherence, with students having the highest grades (>15), presenting a high level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) (25.3%), compared to the low (10.5%) and moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) (15.8%) groups; while the low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) group presented the highest percentage of students with low grades (17.8%).  Moreover, anthropometric measurements were shown to be significantly associated with the KIDMED scores. Students with low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) presented the highest mean weight (69.60 ± 0.9 kg) compared to the other two adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) groups. As for the BMI-for-age percentile, 81.1% of students with high index scores presented a normal weight, while the highest percentage of obese and overweight students were observed in the low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) group (15.5% and 27.",221ec0d9-ada1-4346-b5b8-bea89b6cbbb2

Breakfast Intake, Breakfast Quality, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) In addition to the overall breakfast intake, specific breakfast options were included in our study in order to evaluate the association between this meal's quality and the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD). Out of 600 participants, 52.8% were breakfast consumers and 47.16% were breakfast skippers. While among breakfast consumers, 68.4% had a healthy breakfast and 31.5% had an unhealthy breakfast.  In the first step, we compared the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) among breakfast consumers and nonconsumers. We noticed that adolescents having a moderate and high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) were more likely to be breakfast consumers (68.8% and 71.6%, respectively) than skippers (31.2% and 28.4%, respectively). Among breakfast skippers, 69.4% had a poor adherence while only 30.",2d21ea19-074a-4c57-8090-60fa74a35471
14,methods14,"6% of breakfast consumers were poorly adherent to the Mediterranean diet (P < 0.001).  In the second step, breakfast consumers were divided into two categories based on the quality of the meal consumed [24] (Table 2). When comparing breakfast quality between the groups of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) in Table 2, we noted that subjects who consumed a healthy breakfast had higher index scores (healthy breakfast (65.3%) vs. breakfast skippers (28.4%) vs. unhealthy breakfast (6.3%)), while breakfast skippers had the lowest scores compared to the other groups (breakfast skippers (69.4%) vs. unhealthy breakfast (17.4%) vs. healthy breakfast (13.2%)) (P < 0.001).  3.4.

Also, the SAFA intake was significantly lower in subjects with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) for girls and for the total sample. In boys, the fiber intake was significantly higher for ones having a moderate and high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) compared to those having a low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD); it was not significant for girls.

17,methods17," Predictor Variables of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) The results of the multiple regression model predicting the KIDMED scores are shown in Table 4. School grades, school type, BMI percentiles, and the type of breakfast were the only significant predictors of the KIDMED scores (P < 0.05) in a model that accounts for 30.2% of the overall variance. Regarding the participant characteristics, school grades were positively associated with the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) (standardized β=0.096; P=0.048), while a negative association was observed for the BMI percentiles (standardized β=−0.101; P=0.044). Furthermore, the school type was also correlated to the index scores; students attending public schools had a significant higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) than those attending private schools. As regards for breakfast quality, a healthy breakfast was related to a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) than an unhealthy breakfast.  4.",65d44f5a-4028-4a08-806e-eacd8d5c9033
18,methods18," Discussion Since the adolescence is a critical period during which students may adopt lasting health behaviors, the present transition in the dietary pattern adopted by this group of age is a critical aspect to monitor. In our study, we evaluated the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) and its association with lifestyle characteristics, anthropometric measurements, breakfast, and nutrients intake. The majority of our adolescents had a low and moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), with significantly higher adherence observed among girls compared with boys. Our study is one of many others highlighting the gender differences in the adoption of the MD [11, 34], while no statistical difference was found in others [13, 16].",3bcfd078-0323-46bb-aa1d-4a7616dd14fd
19,methods19," When comparing the scores of our sample with other studies to assess the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) in the Mediterranean region (Table 5), our population presented the highest proportion of adolescents having a low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), followed by the adolescents of Greece (42%), Turkey (40.6%), and Italy (32.8%) [13, 16, 17]. On the contrary, Spain and Southern Spain seemed to have the lowest percentages in this department (12.2% and 2%, respectively), while the highest percentages of adolescents had a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) (30.9% and 46.9%, respectively) [18, 19]. Italy, Cyprus, and Greece had the lowest percentages regarding the high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) (5%, 6.7%, and 6.8%) with more adolescents in this country having a moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) [10, 16, 17].",4bd07ccc-3052-44a2-9442-6b6fc5320507
20,methods20,"  Among subject's sociodemographic characteristics, age and gender were not significant predictors of the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), although there was found to be a significant difference for both variables. These findings are in accordance with other studies that found a negative association between age and KIDMED scores and showed that girls have a higher adherence than boys [19].  The school type however was a strong predictor of the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD). In fact, students from public schools were found to have a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) compared to their counterparts, which seems to be due to the socioeconomic status (SES) of the students, knowing that students in public schools tend to come from low-income families due to the differences between public and private schools expenditures [35].",534db039-73cc-4103-a518-7cf51f732760
21,methods21," In fact, there are conflicting results in the studies evaluating the association between the socioeconomic status (SES) and the dietary habits, which may be due to the disparities between developing and industrialized countries [36]. Studies conducted in Lebanon on older adults showed that subjects with higher income made healthier choices in their dietary pattern, thus having the purchasing power needed to access healthier food [37]. However, when evaluating the socioeconomic status (SES) with childhood and adolescent's obesity and dietary habits, Nasreddine et al. showed that in middle-income countries such as Lebanon, pediatric obesity appears to be predominant among high-income families [38].  Regarding the anthropometric measurements, our study found that adiposity is associated with the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), with the majority of our overweight and obese students presenting a low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD).",7c63d175-ffaa-4e5f-a9d8-0ce14511742b
22,methods22," The linear regression model conducted showed a negative association between BMI percentiles and KIDMED scores proving that a higher body weight is correlated with a lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD). This result constitutes further evidence for this hypothesis found in several studies, conducted in different Mediterranean countries with low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), suffering from high rates of pediatric obesity, such as Italy, Cyprus, and Greece [10, 16, 39]. In fact, Fahed et al. reported that the transition from traditional MD to western dietary patterns increased the prevalence of metabolic diseases and obesity in Mediterranean countries [40].  Likewise, school performance was also proved by this study to be positively associated with the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD). In fact, school grades were positively correlated with the KIDMED scores, where students having higher school grades presenting higher scores.",4beaf809-f54a-4ba4-8886-b44506b77312
23,methods23," Studies evaluating the association between the MD and cognition are usually carried out on older adults and elderly [41, 42]. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of the MD on adolescents' academic performance, for example, the study of Esteban-Cornejo et al. conducted on Spanish adolescents and the study of Santomauro et al. conducted on Italian adolescents [43, 44]. The results of both studies agree with our findings on the beneficial impact of the MD on adolescents' school performance.  Among the 16 questions of the KIDMED test, 4 of them refer to the breakfast intake and quality, which is the reason why we evaluated the association between breakfast and MD. The results of the study sample showed that all students belonging to the high adherence group were breakfast consumers, while breakfast skippers had a low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), which was also concluded in several studies, for example, the study of Lazarou et al.",02a9bd1a-0867-4a88-9184-a0f7cfafa071
24,methods24," conducted on the adolescents of Cyprus [10]. Less is, however, known about the relationship between the breakfast quality and the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD). In our study, the breakfast quality was a strong predictor of the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD). We found that healthy breakfast consumers had a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD). Based on our knowledge, no other study has sought this association, but studies have shown that breakfast skippers tend to have poor dietary habits overall, with an irregular snacking frequency and a high consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages [45, 46].  Regarding daily nutrients intake, our study provided evidence that students having a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) had a higher protein, fiber, and water intake compared to the other adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) groups.",9309b48b-df56-4f2a-9d06-0bb01a75ddc3
25,methods25," These findings are in agreement with several studies [37, 46] and may be explained by the high intake of healthy animal and vegetable sources of protein in the MD, such as fish, dairy products, legumes, and nuts; and the high intake of legumes and whole grain cereals as a source of fiber [3]. Carbohydrates intake were higher among students with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), which is mostly due to the different varieties of carbohydrate sources present in this pattern, knowing that the basic elements composing the three main meals in the MD are fruits, vegetables, and whole grain cereals [3]. Finally, fat intake was higher among the low-adherence group, with significant high intake of SAFA.",b7786c81-6add-4e39-999a-0a4b011f0731
26,methods26," These findings are similar to those of a study conducted on a national sample of Lebanese adolescents, showing that subjects adopting a western dietary rather than the traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern were associated with a higher intake of high fat foods and a higher frequency of eating out [11].  Overall, our study has shown that the prevalence of Lebanese adolescents following an MD is decreasing and a transition to a Western dietary pattern is predominating in our youth. The reason behind the decreased adherence in Lebanese adolescents is mainly due to the increased availability of non-Mediterranean food products during the past years [12] and the adoption of a western-like dietary pattern by the adolescents of our country [11, 12].  There are few limitations in this study: first, since this study is retrospective and cross-sectional, we could not determine the causality of this association, only the interrelationships.",6466589e-5260-4954-b9a3-aa0664b5e045
27,methods27," However, based on our knowledge, it is the first study evaluating the dietary pattern of Lebanese adolescents according to the standards of the traditional MD, using the KIDMED index. Therefore, it should call for future studies and could be used for further investigations. Second, the questionnaires were self-administered which may lead to misreporting and data bias; but dietitians were fully aware of the situation and monitored the students intensively. Third, the daily nutrients intake data are based on a 24 h recall for only one day, which may not be representative of the whole week, but as mentioned before, it represented a typical day of the week.",4fc2f532-a8d9-4240-828e-2fc134cee0b8
28,methods28," Finally, the study is conducted in only two regions of Lebanon, which may not give us the ability to consider our results as a conclusion on a national basis, but it can give us an idea of the present rating regarding the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) and obesity and offers data for further studies, knowing that they included approximately half of the Lebanese students.  5. Conclusions In conclusion, this study showed a low adherence (43%) to the MD among Lebanese adolescents. Students with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) had better school performance and lower adiposity. In addition, the school type was found to be a significant predictor of the KIDMED scores, with public schools having the highest adherence. Our results have also provided evidence on the association between the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) and a healthier dietary intake and breakfast quality.",770a2973-d00e-4e95-a334-ed5aee762342
29,methods29," Finally, given that the dietary patterns adopted in the early years of life can lead to an increasing risk of metabolic diseases in adulthood, our data may raise further need for increased awareness on the benefits of the MD among parents and adolescents in Lebanon through school-based interventions.
