0,methods0," This cross-sectional study included 1273 schoolchildren, from Chile (n = 496), Colombia (n = 340), and Spain (n = 437), selected by convenience. The children’s parents and guardians were informed about the study and provided signed written consent for their participation. Additionally, all children gave their written consent on the day of the assessment. The study was carried out under the recommendations for human studies of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee (ORDN°016-31012019 and ACT N°086).  The inclusion criteria were: (i) presenting informed consent of the parents and the consent of the participant, (ii) belonging to an educational center, and (iii) being between 4 and 6 years of age. The exclusion criteria were having a musculoskeletal disorder or any other known medical condition that might alter the participant’s health and physical activity levels.",8c4ad48d-4482-4a09-83c1-a9f2dc824eff
1,methods1," Moreover, schoolchildren with physical, sensorial, or intellectual disabilities were excluded. The study design is shown in Figure 1.  2.1. Anthropometric Assessments  The body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), calculated as the body mass divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/m2), was used to estimate the degree of obesity. The body mass (kg) was measured using a TANITA® scale, the Scale Plus UM—028 model (Tokyo, Japan). The children were weighed in their underclothes without shoes, and their height (m) was estimated with a SECA® stadiometer, model 214 (Hamburg, Germany) that was graduated in mm.  2.2. Abdominal Obesity  Waist circumference (WC) was measured by a SECA® 201 tape (Hamburg, Germany) in the anatomical position of the umbilical scar [27]. The waist-to-height ratio (WtHR) was calculated by dividing WC by height. Then, to categorize AO, a greater WtHR ≥ 0.50 was used [28,29,30].  2.3.",9a74ed66-c90f-4aa0-be5f-0f30f4f58014
2,methods2," Mediterranean Diet Adherence and Physical Activity  The parents or guardians of the children filled out the information about their children. First, they completed the information about the food habits and PA patterns for their children. (1) MD adherence was assessed by the Krece Plus test [31], a tool to determine eating patterns and the relationship with nutritional status based on the MD. The questionnaire has 15 items, and the format assesses a set of items about the food consumed in the diet. Each item has a score of +1 or −1, depending on whether it approximates the ideal of the MD. The total points are added, and according to the score, the nutritional status is classified as follows: (i) low nutritional level: less than or equal to 5; (ii) moderate nutritional level: from 6 to 8; and (iii) high nutritional level: greater than or equal to 9. This questionnaire has been used in Chilean schoolchildren [32]. (2) The child’s lifestyle was evaluated with the PA Krece Plus test [31].",83f3308b-4471-488b-bfd4-c6455e61d949
3,methods3," The Krece Plus is a quick questionnaire that classifies lifestyle according to a daily average of hours spent watching television or playing video games (screen time) and PA hours after school per week. The classification is made according to the number of hours for each item. The total points are added, and the person is classified as having a good lifestyle (men: ≥9, women: ≥8), a regular lifestyle (men: 6–8, women: 5–7), or a bad lifestyle (men: ≤5, women: ≤4) according to the lifestyle score.  2.4. Sociodemographic Background of Parents  An ad hoc sociodemographic questionnaire was used; information such as the educational level, marital status, and socioeconomic background (based on the parents’ socioeconomic self-perception) was collected from the parents by personal interviews of a member of the school staff. This procedure was carried out into a comfortable room in each school by country. The questionnaire was added to the Krece Plus at the beginning.  2.5.",9a2a519a-6eb6-4001-adad-39184008d5ac
4,methods4," Physical Fitness  To measure physical fitness, we included leg strength, cardiorespiratory fitness (cardiometabolic risk factors (CRF)), and handgrip strength. The lower-body explosive strength was measured using the standing long jump test (standing long jump test (SLJ)) [33]. The standing long jump test (SLJ) test has been used in preschool and schoolchildren previously [34] and their development includes jumping a distance with both feet simultaneously on a hard surface. Following this, each student stands behind a jump line with their feet a shoulder width apart; thus, the knees are bent with the arms in front of the body and in a parallel position to the ground. From here, they swing their arms, push hard, and jump as far as possible, making contact with the ground with both feet and in a vertical position. The standing long jump test (SLJ) test is applied twice, and the best result is recorded for future analyses.",20171cc2-019f-4335-a10b-127112bf7fec
5,methods5,"  The handgrip strength was applied to measure the upper body strength using a hand dynamometer (TKK® 5101 Grip D; Takei, Tokyo, Japan). This test consists of holding a dynamometer in one hand and squeezing it as tightly as possible, without allowing the equipment to touch the body. The force is applied gradually and continuously for a maximum of 3–5 s [33]. This test was performed twice, and the maximum score to each hand was registered in kilograms (kg). The mean of the scores achieved in the left and right hands were used in the final analysis. A higher score of handgrip strength indicates better strength performance.  The cardiometabolic risk factors (CRF) was measured by the 10 × 20 m test, applied by the spatial structure of the Léger test [35]. The 10 × 20 m test was used on child participants that were previously validated [36].",786aef13-dccb-494d-8660-592968395293
6,methods6," The materials to the 10 × 20 m test required included a tape measure to limit the distance of the runway (20 m), two boxes, five balloons, and a stopwatch for the time register. The test was a 20 m shuttle test, in which children had to move five balloons from box A, located in one extreme, to another box B, located at the opposite extreme of box A. Thus, the total distance covered was 200 m, timed from the signal “go” until each participant delivered the last balloon. In this line, it did not matter if the balloon was not delivered into the box. Additionally, if the balloon was dropped during the runs, the participant had to pick it up and carry on moving. All the supervisors gave instructions to the participants about the balloon having to be held with both hands. The test allowed both running and walking to children. For this test, only one attempt was allowed by the participant. The results were recorded in seconds (s) with one decimal place.",e7aba41f-c2ba-4ce9-bda3-717b025e71b1
7,methods7," The test score registered was the running time, where a longer time indicates poorer performance, but a low time indicates great performance.  2.6. Statistical Analysis  Statistical analyses were developed by the STATA V.13.0. software (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). The normal distribution was tested by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. For continuous outcomes, values are shown as mean and the 5th and 95th percentiles, whereas for categorical variables, they are presented as numbers and proportions (%). The differences by sex and country factor were tested using the Kruskal–Wallis test, and the Mann–Whitney U test.

8,methods8," The association between the sociodemographic backgrounds of the parents and the results for their children’s fitness and lifestyle were tested using the β coefficient, where linear and logistic regression with the inclusion of odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was included. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  3. Results  3.1. Sociodemographic Characteristics  Table 1 shows the anthropometric characteristics, physical fitness, and nutritional status of the children according to their country. The anthropometric parameters show that Chilean children reported a higher WtHR (p < 0.001) than their Colombian and Spanish peers. Regarding fitness, Colombian children reported worse results in the 10 × 20 test than their Chilean and Spanish peers. Additionally, Chilean children showed a lower handgrip strength than their Colombian and Spanish peers.

Prevalence of Abdominal Obesity  Figure 2 shows the prevalence of AO (a, b), lifestyle category (c, d), and nutritional level (e, f) by country, and by country and sex (b, d, f). Chilean schoolchildren reported a high prevalence of AO and a high prevalence of bad lifestyles. Colombian preschoolers reported the lowest MD adherence.  3.3. Parents’ Sociodemographic Characteristics  Table 2 shows the parents’ sociodemographic characteristics for the study sample, according to the country. Looking at their parents’ socioeconomic background, the Chilean children had the highest proportion of parents in the low/medium socioeconomic level (41.7%), followed by the Colombian preschoolers (37.7%) and the Spanish preschoolers (11.0%) (p < 0.001) (Table 2).  3.4.",a1c4279a-c0bb-4080-8df8-03ca29f93874
10,methods10," Associations between Parental Sociodemographic Background and Children’s Characteristics  Table 3 shows the association between the parental sociodemographic status and the anthropometric, fitness, and lifestyle parameters of the children according to country. For the Chilean children, there was an inverse association between a low or medium-low socioeconomic level for the parents and SJT (β −3.90, p = 0.043) and handgrip strength (β −0.61, p < 0.001). Likewise, for the Spanish children, an inverse association was found between the parents’ socioeconomic level and PA after school (β −0.58, p = 0.016), lifestyle (β −0.74, p = 0.015), and MD adherence (β −0.86, p = 0.004). For the Colombian preschoolers, a low educational level showed a positive association with SJT (β 5.87, p = 0.016) and an inverse association with MD adherence (β −0.63, p = 0.004), while for Spanish children, it had an inverse association with MD adherence (β 0.58, p = 0.003).  3.5.",ef03eebc-732f-42d1-85e0-003053c3b1a9
11,methods11," Association of Parental Characteristics with Abdominal Obesity (AO)  Table 4 shows the association between parental characteristics and AO, low nutritional level, and bad lifestyle in the children. Divorced/separated status for the parents presented an inverse association with AO (OR 0.21, p = 0.045) in Spanish preschoolers. However, the parent’s marital status and low educational level were risk factors for a low nutritional level in Colombian children (OR 2.02, p = 0.048; OR 2.49, p < 0.001, respectively). The single marital status for the parents showed an inverse association with a bad lifestyle for the Spanish children (OR 0.21, p = 0.012). Parents having a primary/secondary educational level showed a positive association with ST of more than 4 h a day for the Chilean children (OR 1.82, p = 0.020).  4. Discussion  The purpose of this study was to determine, through a cross-cultural study, the association between the sociodemographic backgrounds of parents (i.e.",564e776f-0b68-4877-9e32-dede8519baad
12,methods12,", their socioeconomic level, marital status, and educational level) with lifestyle (i.e., MD, PA after school, and ST) and health markers of children. The results show that: (i) there was an inverse association between the parents having a low or medium-low socioeconomic level and the fitness, PA after school, lifestyle, and MD adherence of their children; (ii) there was an inverse association between the single marital status for the parents and Spanish children having a bad lifestyle; and (iii) for the Chilean children, there was a positive association between the low educational level of the parents and ST of more than 4 h a day. Thus, a medium-low socioeconomic, a single marital status for the parents, and a low educational level of the parents are all related to sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health markers in children of three OCDE countries of different socio-cultural and economic (i.e., based on GDP per capita) characteristics.",c454953a-d889-4a79-bac6-c5d8faa78fac
13,methods13,"  According to the sociodemographic parameters of the parents, a low or medium-low socioeconomic level had an inverse association with fitness health markers and positive lifestyle (i.e., PA after school and MD adherence) in children. In this sense, physical inactivity (i.e., a negative lifestyle) is recognized as a determinant of children’s low fitness and health markers [37]. Unfortunately, fitness level is a potential biomarker of health from an early age; thus, improvements in physical fitness performance could be important for the health of preschoolers [38]. In this field, a study conducted for young people reported that the ‘high’ socioeconomic level group had better cardiometabolic risk factors (CRF) and musculoskeletal fitness than the ‘low’ and ‘moderate’ cardiometabolic risk factors (CRF) group [39].",28781494-f44a-4d94-ab81-f2fbde4e14bc
14,methods14," Additionally, it has been shown that schoolchildren from a low socioeconomic level have a lower PA level and a worse nutritional status than their counterparts with a ‘high’ socioeconomic level [40]. Another study showed that a higher socioeconomic level for the family was associated with higher PA levels in children [41]. In a similar way to our results, a study conducted for Spanish preschoolers showed that the socioeconomic level was positively associated with better scores in MD adherence [42]. Another study conducted for Australian preschoolers found that subjects with higher socioeconomic levels had diets closer to healthy guidelines for most food [43]. Furthermore, the higher socioeconomic status of the family has been associated with healthier eating, PA, and control of weight practices when compared with families with lower socioeconomic status [44].",f7ff489d-b2de-482a-bbf7-0a285b6475af
15,methods15,"  Within our results, it is very important to mention that lifestyle is decisive for future activities in life; lifestyle has been related to children’s motor skills [45], psychological well-being [11], academic performance [2], and fitness [46]. Additionally, Manios et al. [47] demonstrated that low diet quality was associated with several sociodemographic factors (i.e., unemployment status and lower maternal educational level) in Greek preschoolers. Moreover, we found that the marital status of the parents (i.e., divorced/separated) showed an inverse association with AO in Spanish preschoolers, with Colombian children showing a low nutritional level. On the other hand, another study reported that children in cohabiting-parent and single-parent families who had experienced a prior structural family change were more likely to be obese unless they were children in single-parent families who were born to married parents when compared with peers of no married parents [48].",2f4685eb-7322-4586-b1f5-aa40cdb7a285
16,methods16," Similarly, Merino et al. [49] showed that there were no significant differences in fatness indicators (i.e., body mass index (BMI), WC, and WtHR) of children whose parents had different marital statuses. In addition, sociodemographic background, such as monthly household income, was negatively associated with body mass index (BMI) in Chinese preschoolers [50]. Another study identified certain factors such as maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, maternal smoking, low education level, and excess weight of parents as significant risk factors for the development of obesity in children [51].  Likewise, in the present study, low educational level (primary/secondary level) reported in the parents of Chilean children showed a positive association with ST of more than 4 h a day. A recent study reported that daily ST was significantly lower in children whose parents had higher education levels (i.e.",4a93e1cc-bddc-4835-a73a-518da6aff2d2
17,methods17,", university education) compared with peers whose parents had a secondary or primary, or no formal education [52]. Moreover, Määttä et al. [40] indicated that parents with a high education judged it to be of greater importance to limit the ST of preschool children, compared to parents with low education. Following this, Downing et al. [53] reported that parental self-efficacy (i.e., limiting ST and imposing ST rules) was inversely associated with ST in Australian preschoolers. This suggests that better-educated parents may be more aware of the importance of PA and may provide healthier options to their children by regulating ST which is an important marker of sedentary, and obesity.",0706ea81-4fbd-4e14-8bf0-07df018ca76f
18,methods18,"  In addition, considering that socio-cultural gaps can be a permanent barrier of health status among children of different countries members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) group, the reduction in the economic gaps promoted at school from the high to those children of low economic status appears as one of the most practical strategies among countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) members.  The limitations of the present study include those inherent to its transversal character. Another limitation is the reporting by parents of their children’s PA and food habits, which could mean that these data are underestimated or overestimated.",ef0f6cb0-a11f-48f9-8e29-424afff084ae
19,methods19," We suggest that there is a need to investigate possible longitudinal effects to clarify the direction of these associations and to carry out more interventions in children’s lifestyles among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries of different socio-cultural, and economic statuses. The strengths of this study are that we examined several variables that affect children’s development and contributed to a better understanding of the severe problem of parents’ sociodemographic background. Additionally, we included three members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that allow future comparisons with other studies involving schoolchildren (preschoolers and scholars) and health markers.  5.",c16c822c-596c-4f9f-a996-3344289c0dc8
20,methods20," Conclusions  In conclusion, in Spanish-speaking children, the lifestyle and health markers of the children are affected by the sociodemographic background of their parents; however, these effects could be moderated by the socio-cultural and economic status of their countries as members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Therefore, it is essential to develop and promote policies that decrease the sociodemographic gaps that affect children’s lifestyle and health markers, so that children who are under-resourced can reach their full potential.
