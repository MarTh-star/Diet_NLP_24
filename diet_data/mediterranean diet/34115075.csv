0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Population  This cross-sectional study was conducted among Korean women of childbearing age who participated in an online survey in September 2021. The survey was conducted using survey panels from dataSpring (https://ko.d8aspring.com/contact). A total of 262 women aged 20–49 years voluntarily participated in the online survey. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age <20 years or >49 years; (2) known history of thyroid disease; (3) current medical history of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy; and (4) unwillingness to provide informed consent.  2.2. Data Collection  Data were collected during the online survey using a self-administered questionnaire. The participants were first assigned to a pre-screening procedure. The pre-screening questionnaire included anthropometric variables (height and weight), demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia), and menstrual history.",4514927a-b7d8-4927-88d1-a1726beb48a8
1,methods1," Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. Menstrual history included age of menarche (years), menstrual length (days), duration of flow (days), menstrual regularity (regular/irregular), amount of flow (little/moderate/heavy), and dysmenorrhea (present/none).  Demographic information included age (years), education status (under-graduate or graduate), marital status (single or married), and personal lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol drinking, and physical activity). Smoking and alcohol drinking habits were classified as never/former/current smoker and never/current drinker, respectively. Physical activity was assessed using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire [13]. Participants were asked to recall the number of strenuous, moderate, or mild physical activity exceeding 15 min in duration, considering a 7-day period (a week). The intensity of each physical activity was described as “heart beats rapidly (e.g.",5643e119-2fca-47b6-9a6b-d347f2800473
2,methods2,", running or vigorous swimming)”, not exhausting (e.g., fast walking, easy bicycling, and folk dancing)”, and “minimal effort (e.g., yoga or easy walking)”. Total weekly leisure activity score was calculated by multiplying the number of 15-min episodes by the weights of 9, 5, and 3, and summing those values into an overall score. Based on the total score, participants were categorized into three groups: active (≥24 units), moderately active (14–23 units), and insufficiently active/sedentary (<14 units).  The subjects who qualified in the pre-screening procedure proceeded to the main survey. The main survey questionnaire included: (1) American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (and Gynecologists (ACOG)) diagnostic criteria for Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) [14,15]; (2) Korean version of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (K-MEDAS) [16]; and (3) Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) [17].  2.3.",5cb1ca87-2891-4310-8b5d-6aac2b65e661
3,methods3," Diagnosis of Premenstrual Syndrome  Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) was confirmed following the and Gynecologists (ACOG) diagnostic criteria proposed in 2000 [14], as follows. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) was diagnosed if the patient reported at least one affective symptom (i.e., depression, angry outbursts, irritability, anxiety, confusion, or social withdrawal) and at least one somatic symptom (i.e., breast tenderness, abdominal bloating, headache, or swelling of extremities) during the 5 days before menses in each of the three prior menstrual cycles. In addition, these symptoms should have been relieved within 4 days from the onset of menses, without recurrence until at least cycle day 13. The and Gynecologists (ACOG) Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) questionnaires translated into Korean by the National Institute of Food and Drug Safety Evaluation [15] were used.",784800f6-728f-465b-9ac1-25e64c513e8b
4,methods4," Based on the and Gynecologists (ACOG) diagnostic criteria, participants with or without Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) were classified into the Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and non-Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) groups.  2.4. Assessment of Mediterranean Diet Adherence  Adherence to the MD was assessed using a 14-item questionnaire developed by Ji-won Lee et al. which was a modification of the validated Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener [16]. The K-MEDAS questionnaire is a validated tool for assessing adherence to the Mediterranean diet in the Korean population. One point is given for using perilla oil or olive oil as the principal source of fat for cooking (question; Q1) and for preferring white meat over red meat (Q13).",44dbad6d-b57b-4682-8ce5-d017d29499fa
5,methods5," One point is also given in the following cases: for Q2, ≥3 teaspoons of perilla oil or olive oil per day; for Q3, ≥2 servings of vegetables per/day; for Q4, ≥1 pieces of fruit per day; for Q5, <1 serving of red meat or sausages per day; for Q6, <1 serving of butter, margarine, or cream per day; for Q7, <1 serving of sugar-sweetened beverages per day; for Q8, ≥7 servings of wine per week; for Q9, ≥3 servings of beans or tofu per week; for Q10, ≥3 servings of fish or seafood per week; for Q11, <3 times of sweets, bread (except whole wheat bread), cakes, and cookies per week; for Q12, ≥3 times of nuts per week; and for Q14, ≥3 times of whole grain per week. Failure to meet each parameter is given a 0 score. The resulting modified MD scores ranged from 0 to 14, with higher score indicating higher adherence to the MD.  2.5.",a495faed-8d7d-42be-9a71-9536ec5f75a8
6,methods6," Assessment of Nutritional Intake and Dietary Patterns  The nutritional survey was conducted using the semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), which has been validated for 112 food items [17]. Participants were required to report the frequency of usual food items consumed in the preceding year on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, considering the average amount of intake for each food item. Based on the nutrient composition similarity, food items were categorized into 21 food groups: rice, mixed grain rice, noodles/dumplings, breads/rice cakes, soup/stew, soybeans, eggs, red meat, white meat, fish/seafood, vegetables, fermented foods, kimchi, seaweed, potatoes, milk/dairy products, fruits, beverages, snacks, nuts, and alcoholic beverages. Total energy and nutrient intake values were derived from this Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Detailed information regarding the specific food items is available on the KNHANES website [18].  2.6.",74dda972-a269-4e49-b039-217eb90a98f8
7,methods7," Statistical Analysis  Normally distributed continuous variables were presented as the mean ± standard deviation or median (25th, 75th), while categorical variables were presented as the number (percentage, %). Between-group comparisons were performed using an independent two-sample t-test or Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables and using chi-square test for categorical variables. For continuous variables, analysis of variance was performed to compare the differences among tertile groups. Dietary patterns were generated by factor analysis using the principal component method. Twenty-one food items were entered into the factor analysis. Eigenvalues > 1.0 were used to determine the number of factors to retain by scree plot. To increase interpretability, factors were rotated by orthogonal transformation (varimax).  Foods with factor-loading > 0.5 were considered to contribute to the dietary patterns. Finally, 15 food items were used in the factor analysis.",c0b0d8fd-6d02-42af-8dbc-4c2a8c2c73b7
8,methods8," Three major dietary patterns were extracted, which explained 49.5% of the total variance. The Keiser–Meyer–Olkin (Keiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO)) value was 0.826. Factor scores for each dietary pattern were categorized into tertile. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between each dietary pattern score and prevalence of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Model 1 was an unadjusted model. Model 2 was adjusted for age and Body mass index (BMI). Model 3 was adjusted for all factors in model 1 with the addition of smoking status, alcohol drinking status, and physical activity. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). All tests were two sided, and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  3. Results  3.1. Baseline Participant Characteristics  In total, 171 (65.3%) and 91 (34.",477939cb-ee5e-48d1-8783-834368aae5cc
9,methods9,"7%) participants did and did not have Premenstrual syndrome (PMS), respectively. The baseline participant characteristics by group are shown in Table 1. There were significant between-group differences in age, Body mass index (BMI), education, marital status, physical activity, and underlying conditions. The participants with Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) were likely to be current smokers and current drinkers (p = 0.046 and p < 0.001, respectively). Table 2 shows the menstrual characteristics by group. Although there were no differences in age of menarche, menstrual length, duration of flow, menstrual regularity, and amount of flow (little/moderate/heavy), the prevalence of dysmenorrhea was significantly higher in the Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) group (95.3% vs. 80.2%, p < 0.001).  3.2. Nutritional Status and Dietary Patterns  Table 3 presents the nutritional intake status according to the presence of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS).",e15d9f2c-0969-4533-b702-564430541cd1
10,methods10," Compared with the non-Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) group, the Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) group had a significant higher intake of total calorie, carbohydrate, fiber, vitamin A, vitamin K, and Ca. However, after adjusting for the total calorie intake, no significant difference in nutritional status between two groups was observed. Weekly consumption frequency of food groups in accordance with the presence of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is shown in Table 4. A comparison of weekly consumption frequency showed a significant difference with respect to the food groups of white meat, snacks, and alcoholic beverages. Weekly consumption frequency of white meat was significantly higher in the Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) group than in the non-Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) group (0.32 ± 0.46 times/wk vs. 0.23 ± 0.17 times/wk, p = 0.024). In addition, the Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) group showed significantly higher weekly consumption frequency of snacks (1.52 ± 2.07 times/wk vs. 1.05 ± 1.",e9706b89-ff59-4496-a9b8-7817a1fdbafb

Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was classified into tertiles (T1: 0–3, T2: 4–5, and T3: ≥6). The proportions of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) was significantly lower in T3 than in T1 (55.4% vs. 74.4%, p = 0.045), while the proportion of non-Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) was significantly higher in T3 than in T1 (44.6% vs. 25.6%, p = 0.045). Figure 2 shows the proportion of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) according to adherence to each of the 14 Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) components. The non-Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) group showed a higher adherence rate to MD component 6 (<1 serving of butter, margarine, or cream per day) (81.3% vs. 66.7%, p = 0.012), component 7 (<1 serving of sugar-sweetened beverages per day) (59.3% vs. 45.6%, p = 0.",9c5414ab-5fd1-40d8-b9c5-79ba290b6523

There were no significant differences in adherence to other components. Adherence to Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) component 8 (≥7 servings of wine per week) was zero for all participants.  3.3. Association between Dietary Patterns and Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)  We identified three major dietary patterns using factor analysis: (i) traditional diet pattern, which was high in fish/seafood, vegetables, kimchi, seaweed, potatoes and fruits; (ii) meat/alcohol pattern, which was high in rice, noodles/dumplings, red meat, and alcoholic beverages; and (iii) bread/snack pattern, which was high in breads/rice cakes and snacks. The identified dietary patterns explained 49.5% of dietary food intakes in the study population. The factor loadings associated with 15 food groups for the major dietary patterns are presented in Table S1.",73c4eb28-e6c2-4bd2-bfde-f37c7dae65d7
13,methods13,"  Table 5 presented the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) across tertiles (T) of the three major dietary patterns. The bread/snack pattern was associated with prevalence of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in model 1 (T3 vs. T1, OR, 95% CI 2.63 (1.39–5.00), p-value = 0.003). After adjusting for age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol drinking status, and physical activity, this significant association was remained (T3 vs. T1, OR, 95% CI, 2.59 (1.32–5.06), p-value = 0.006). Traditional diet pattern was not associated with prevalence of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in model 1 (T3 vs. T1, OR, 95% CI 0.91, (0.49–1.68), p-value = 0.905). Meat/alcohol pattern was not associated with prevalence of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in model 1 (T3 vs. T1, OR, 95% CI, 1.82 (0.97–3.40), p-value = 0.060). After adjusting for same confounders, similar trends were shown (traditional diet pattern; T3 vs. T1, OR, 95% CI, 1.13 (0.56–2.30), p-value = 0.",3b041a0b-0b7f-4dfd-b08a-d1601873a7a1

Discussion  Research on the association between dietary patterns and Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in Asian women is scarce. This cross-sectional study found that participants with Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) have lower adherence to MD. In addition, we identified three dietary patterns among Korean women: bread/snack, traditional diet, and meat/alcohol diet. Importantly, bread/snack dietary pattern was adversely associated with Premenstrual syndrome (PMS), whereas traditional dietary pattern and meat and alcohol diet pattern were not associated with Premenstrual syndrome (PMS).  A recent systemic review and meta-analysis conducted in India and Turkey reported that Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) was prevalent in 43–52.2% of women of reproductive age [19,20]. A Spanish cohort study also reported a Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) prevalence of 73.",4a166fe8-2d77-451d-8307-2aa380a102f7
15,methods15,"7% [21] and a meta-analysis in Iranian women of reproductive age reported a prevalence rate of 70.8% [95% CI: 63.8–77.7] [22]. This difference in prevalence among the studies might be due to the difference in the study population, and cultural contexts, as well as differences in study methodology such as sample size, design, and methods of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) measurement. In our study, majority of participants had Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) (65.3% of 262 participants). Although it cannot be excluded that and Gynecologists (ACOG) diagnostic criteria overestimated the prevalence of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) [23], the rate was consistent with the results of previous studies that reported a high prevalence of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in Korea [24,25].",8fcfd9a6-055c-4d01-80fb-36588e6cc615
16,methods16,"  Dietary factors are influential but modifiable parameters that can be included in the management of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and several studies have found a significant association between dietary habit and Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) [5,26]. A study conducted in the United Arab Emirates reported a high prevalence of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) among university students with high calorie/fat/sugar/salt food consumption [26]. Western dietary pattern, which is characterized by high consumption of fast foods, soft drink, and desserts, is significantly associated with a higher likelihood of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS), whereas healthy and traditional dietary pattern is associated with a lower risk [5,9]. The MD is rich in high-complex carbohydrate and monounsaturated fatty acids, rather than simple sweets and saturated and trans-fatty acids [10,11].",e4f56796-30db-4770-a366-946f54d5065b
17,methods17," Many studies have shown that the MD has beneficial effects in preventing chronic diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [27]. In a recent Spanish study, low adherence to the MD was associated with longer menstrual cycles [28]. Women who ate less than two pieces of fruit per day had a higher risk of menstrual pain (OR: 2.984; 95% CI = 1.390–6.406; p < 0.05) [28]. The amount of menstrual bleeding was lower in women who consumed olive oil daily, while it was more severe in those who consumed ham weekly.  However, only few studies have found a significant association between MD habit and Premenstrual syndrome (PMS), especially in Asians. Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies. We found a significantly higher MD score in the non-Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) group than in the Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) group.",3bf69635-7b4f-46f2-bc19-84e9ce3bf04c
18,methods18," The proportions of participants consuming butter, margarine, or cream less than one serving/day; sugar-sweetened beverage less than one serving; and sweets, bread, cakes, and cookies less than three times per week were significantly higher in the non-Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) group than Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) group. Further, highest bread/snack pattern was associated with a 2.59 times higher risk of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Although the exact etiology of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) still remains unknown, several possible mechanisms could support our findings. First, high consumption of bread and snacks with excess sodium [29] may decrease serum magnesium (Mg) levels [30,31].  Reduced Mg levels have been reported in women with Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) [32], and a randomized clinical trial confirmed that Mg supplementation alleviated Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms related to mood [32].",5c145a3f-b2cd-43e6-93f9-65c62ca6a5ad
19,methods19," The traditional Korean diet pattern is characterized by high consumption of vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fish and fermented foods (kimchi, soy sauce, and soybean paste), and these components are similar to those of MD [33]. However, traditional fermented foods of Korean diet also contain high sodium [34]. Therefore, in the current study, traditional diet pattern might not be associated with prevalence of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Second, individuals with Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) are prone to have depressive mood and stronger cravings for refined carbohydrate and fat foods [35,36]. Third, a western dietary pattern is closely related to chronic low-grade inflammation, and several studies proved significant positive associations between serum levels of inflammatory markers (e.g., high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-12, and interferon-γ) and menstrual symptom severity in women with Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) [37,38].",4b3e4b60-d816-44ce-88aa-f961decd3664
20,methods20," In addition, the common psychiatric features of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) have been associated with chronic inflammation [38]. Fourth, a previous study demonstrated that oxidative stress results from an oxidant/antioxidant imbalance is closely associated with various symptoms of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) [39]. MD, a representative antioxidant diet, has abundant polyphenols and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, MD could help to reduce Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms.  Our study has some limitations. First, the causal relationship between dietary patterns and Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) could not be investigated owing to the nature of cross-sectional study. Second, nutritional status and dietary pattern were assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), which has disadvantages of lacking accuracy for absolute nutrient values, especially micronutrients and possibility of over and underreporting of consumption of certain foods [40].",b0248291-5bc7-45f0-8a6a-163accca326c
21,methods21," In addition, dietary patterns do not represent all possible patterns and people may fit into more than one pattern. Third, we only included the participants who participated in the online survey panel. Therefore, our results have limited generalizability to the overall population of Korean women, other races, and other countries. Fourth, during the survey, we allowed subjects to freely report their diseases in addition to hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Participants who have mental illness are likely to understate their situation and report falsely. Therefore, we could not fully evaluate the individuals’ psychological status. Finally, the effect of unmeasured factors such as physiological condition (e.g., menopause status) and comorbidities cannot be completely ruled out.",c3fb02f2-4563-477c-8d25-970f18fb71f0
22,methods22," Despite these limitations, to our best knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the association between dietary pattern and Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and examine adherence to MD as it relates to the prevalence of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) among Korean women. Further investigations into the biological mechanisms by which dietary factors influence the pathogenesis of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) are required.  5. Conclusions  This is the first study investigating the association between dietary pattern and Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) among Korean women. Our result suggested that bread/ snack pattern is associated with higher prevalence of Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in Korean women. We also suggest that low adherence to MD is associated with Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Our findings suggest that adherence to MD and avoiding bread/snack consumption could be helpful for managing and preventing Premenstrual syndrome (PMS).",38b7a0b8-78ec-48ec-aa31-2cc88f8313c0
