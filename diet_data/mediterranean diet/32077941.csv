0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Participants  The Aragon Workers’ Health Study (Aragon Workers’ Health Study (AWHS)) is a prospective longitudinal study aimed at evaluating the association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and metabolic abnormalities and subclinical atherosclerosis in a middle-aged working population in Spain that was cardiovascular disease (CVD)-free at the beginning of the study. The cohort, recruited between February 2009 and December 2010, consists of 5678 workers at an automobile assembly plant in Zaragoza (Spain) who voluntarily agreed to participate in the study. Between 2011 and 2014, participants aged 39–59 years were invited to undergo more intensive monitoring consisting of subclinical atherosclerosis imaging, clinical and physical examination, and questionnaires on lifestyle factors. Further information on the Aragon Workers’ Health Study (AWHS) can be found in the bibliography [15].",c0760c6c-4e01-42e2-a535-c949f588c214
1,methods1,"  As shown in Figure 1, the present study included all Aragon Workers’ Health Study (AWHS) participants in the more intensive monitoring group who began lipid-lowering therapy during the period 2010 to 2013 for primary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Given the low percentage of females in the Aragon Workers’ Health Study (AWHS), as well as recognized sex-related effects on health behaviors, the 23 female participants were excluded from our analyses. Individuals for which complete lifestyle data were unavailable were also excluded. Ultimately, 517 men were included in our analysis.  2.2. Data Sources and Variables  Drug prescription data were gathered from Farmasalud, the Medication Consumption Information System of Aragon. This database collects the following information on all prescriptions dispensed at pharmacies in Aragon via the public health care system (accounting for 98.",485d7cab-b6b7-4c10-bc21-3aa14e9710ef
2,methods2,"5% of the population): anonymous patient code; sex; birth date; Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)) code of the prescribed drug; dispensing date; number of defined daily doses (defined daily doses (DDD)); and number of packages dispensed. Prescriptions issued by private physicians, insurance companies, and in-hospital consumption are not recorded in the Farmasalud database. All prescriptions for lipid-lowering drugs (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code C10 according to the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)/defined daily doses (DDD) Index) issued between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2014 were recorded. In addition, the number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) preventive co-treatments prescribed to each worker in the index year was determined by taking into account the existence of any prescription for antidiabetic (A10 code), antihypertensive (C02, C03, C07, C08, C09) or antithrombotic (B01) drugs.",4fba774c-a6be-4967-bfa1-742aa3a08150
3,methods3," The drug burden for each worker was analyzed as the total number of pharmacological subgroups (i.e., different Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes at the 3rd level in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system) prescribed during the index year. Each pharmacological subgroup includes drugs with a similar indication or mechanism of action, so that it constitutes a proxy of the burden of medication and, indirectly, of morbidity.  Clinical and laboratory data recorded by the physicians and nurses of the factory medical services at the annual workplace medical examination were collected for the period 2011 to 2014. The physical examination included measurement of height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure. It followed standardized protocols using validated procedures and instruments described in the standard operating procedures. The study conforms to the ISO9001-2008 quality standard.",3eedcde5-e09f-4397-b89a-1313cc2bf321
4,methods4," Waist circumference was measured with a GulicK II measuring tape model 67019. The highest point of the iliac crest and the lowest point of the costal margin were located in the mid-axillary line. The midpoint was calculated and the measuring tape was placed around the waist coinciding with that point and in a horizontal plane. Blood pressure was measured three consecutive times using an automatic oscillometric sphygmomanometer OMRON M10-IT (OMRON Healthcare Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) with the participant sitting after a 5-min rest. The self-reported smoking status of the individuals in the preceding year was also recorded. Total cholesterol levels, fasting serum glucose, and glycated haemoglobin concentration were determined by enzyme analysis using the ILAB 650 analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory; Bedford, MA, USA), and levels of Low-Density Lipoprotein (Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL))-cholesterol were estimated using the Friedewald equation [16].",2567fadf-697b-4093-8a32-7926785dd432
5,methods5," The following cut-off points were applied based on current European Guidelines [2]: overweight, Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) ≥25 and <30; obesity, Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30; hypertension, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg and systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg; hypercholesterolemia, total cholesterol ≥200 mg/dl and Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol ≥115 mg/dl; diabetes, fasting serum glucose ≥126 mg/dl and glycated hemoglobin ≥6.5%.  Participants also completed a questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics including age, sex, education level, work shift, and type of work performed. The protocols for data collection are described in detail elsewhere [15].  Dietary habits were assessed by a face-to-face interview through a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire previously validated for the Spanish population [17]. The questionnaire consists of 136 questions on habitual food intake over the previous 12 months, and was administered by a trained dietician.",9be0c629-f607-4cbc-9340-35027d90c32d
6,methods6," Data derived from the questionnaire were subsequently converted into energy and nutrients using Spanish food composition tables [18,19]. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using the Alternate Mediterranean Dietary (aMED) index [20]. The aMED score involves the following food groups and nutrients: fruit; vegetables; nuts; legumes; whole grains; fish; ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat; red and processed meats; and alcohol. The total aMED score ranges from 0–9, with higher scores reflecting greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet. Accordingly, the aMED score obtained for each worker was classified as low (0–3), medium (4–6), or high (7–9).  Leisure time and physical activity were assessed using the validated Spanish version [21,22] of the Nurses’ Health Study [23] and the Health Professionals’ Follow-up study [24] physical activity questionnaires. Participants were asked about the frequency of and time devoted to different types of physical activity.",6e4a7742-b482-4438-8bd1-9a5eb16decc2
7,methods7," This time was multiplied by the corresponding metabolic cost according to Ainsworth’s compendium for physical activities [25], and expressed in metabolic equivalents (metabolic equivalents (MET)). The total level of physical activity per week per individual was estimated by adding the metabolic equivalents (MET)s for all activities. Sedentary time was calculated as the number of hours that each worker reported spending seated during a weekday, during both working and leisure time. Sleep time, taken as the usual number of hours of sleep per weekday, was also recorded for each individual.  Finally, information on healthcare utilization during the period 2015 to 2018 was gathered from different administrative health databases (i.e., primary, specialist, hospital, and emergency care databases) and linked with the rest of the data using the anonymized patient code.",7660ad4b-ef9a-4149-b0c9-80974b73b109
8,methods8," The number of visits to the emergency department, general practitioners, and specialist physicians, as well as the number of hospitalizations for each worker for the period 2015 to 2018 were recorded. In addition, the number of individual hospital discharges with a principal diagnosis code corresponding to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (G45, G46, G81-G83, I20-I28, I46, I49.0, I50, and I60-I79 in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (CD-10)) was also recorded. Both the number and burden of chronic diseases for each worker in 2018 were retrieved from the Adjusted Morbidity Groups (Groups (GMA)) database. Groups (GMA) is a method developed to calculate an individual’s morbidity burden and adapted to the Spanish healthcare system [26]. Finally, the number and date of all-cause deaths, for the period 2015 to 2018, were obtained from the Spanish National Mortality Registry.  2.3.",99c3493a-1580-4683-b8c4-470c393d8e43
9,methods9," Analyses  For each individual, the index date was defined as the date of dispensing of the first lipid-lowering drug. Analyses were restricted to new users, defined as those who had not received any lipid-lowering drug prescription during the 6 months preceding the index date (i.e., between 1 July 2010 and 31 December 2013).  Persistence with medication was defined as the time from initiation until discontinuation during a follow-up period of 1 year (between 2010 and 2014). Applying criteria utilized in previous studies [27], the number of days’ supply for each lipid-lowering prescription was estimated based on the usual dosage and form of presentation of the drug. Statin and fibrate prescriptions were assigned a defined daily doses (DDD) of 28 and 30, respectively. A worker was classified as persistent if there was no gap between 2 refills exceeding 2.5 times the duration of the previous prescription during the 1-year follow-up period.",5ce33962-0a31-4d0d-b79a-41b17871b3a5
10,methods10," The selection of this criterium was based on sensitivity analyses performed in a previous study [27]. The accumulation of supplies over time was not considered.  The baseline characteristics of the study population as well as the proportion of individuals considered persistent with lipid-lowering medication were recorded. Categorical variables were expressed as the frequency (n) and proportion (%), and continuous variables as the mean and standard deviation. The European cardiovascular score for countries with low cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk was also calculated for each individual [28].  We performed a cluster analysis to identify different aggregations or profiles of subjects according to their adherence to cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention recommendations. Specifically, a 2-step cluster analysis was applied because it allows the use of both categorical and continuous variables.",a0233cd3-895e-415c-ae27-9e4b52f79e27
11,methods11," This technique automatically determines the optimal number of clusters needed to perform the data grouping based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)). The log-likelihood distance was used to calculate the similitude between groups. Thus, individuals are assigned to groups based on maximum within-group similarity and between-group differences with respect to the variables initially considered of interest.  In the present study, these variables were as follows: adherence to the Mediterranean diet; energy intake; physical activity; sitting time; alcohol intake; smoking status; and persistence with therapy. The variables ultimately selected to define clusters must be independent from the rest of the variables conforming the clusters.",15ec60fd-f150-4d8d-83d6-5b094a763af4
12,methods12," The quality of fit of the resulting groups of clusters is evaluated using the silhouette measure of cohesion and separation, which contrasts the mean distance among elements within the same cluster with the average distance to elements in other clusters. A silhouette coefficient ≥0.2 is considered acceptable [29,30]. When a similar silhouette coefficient was obtained for different possible aggregations, the selection of the final group of clusters was based on the independence (no-correlation) and clinical coherence of the resulting variables.  Once the different profiles of workers were identified by cluster analysis, the corresponding data on sociodemographic characteristics, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, cardiovascular scores, lifestyle, burden of chronic disease, number of comorbidities and cardiovascular disease (CVD) preventive co-treatments, pharmacological subgroups, and contact with healthcare services were compared.",653829e0-a8ae-4fe2-9c2a-708b2302c42c
13,methods13," An as determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was applied for comparison of continuous variables with normal distribution (previously demonstrated by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test), Kruskall–Wallis for no normal continuous variables and chi-square for categorical variables (Fisher test when expected frequencies were lower than 5). When there were more than 2 groups, we also performed pairwise comparisons adjusting for multiple testing (Tukey when row-variable was normal-distributed and Benjamini and Hochberg method otherwise).  Two-step cluster analyses were performed using SPSS version 22 (license University of Zaragoza), and all subsequent analyses were performed using R statistical software.  2.4. Ethical Aspects  All research was conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines, and study participants provided written informed consent to participate in the Aragon Workers’ Health Study (AWHS). All data used were anonymized, making patient identification impossible.",a13e78b5-5562-4d95-b2d8-c290c9e06bff
14,methods14," The study was approved by the Aragon Research Ethics Committee (Project identification code PI07/09).  3. Results  The baseline characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1. Among the 517 male workers, the mean age was 51.0 (SD 3.7) years and 48.3% had completed primary studies. Additionally, 78.7% performed rotating shift work and 85.1% performed manual work. Most were either current (38.1%) or former (44.3%) smokers, 59.6% were overweight, and 26.9% were obese. The distribution of other traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors was as follows: hypertension, 17.7%; hypercholesterolemia, 83.3%; diabetes, 3.5%. Less than one-third of the study population was persistent with lipid-lowering therapy.",fdf95bc6-31cb-4e30-8f93-476666e96e43
15,methods15,"  The four different clusters into which the 517 workers were aggregated were defined based on the following characteristics, in order of importance: adherence to the Mediterranean diet; persistence with lipid-lowering therapy; smoking status; and physical activity (Figure 2). For this group of clusters, the silhouette coefficient was 0.4, what indicates an acceptable quality of clustering. Cluster 1 (n = 113) comprised workers with healthier lifestyles (61.1% never smoked; 84.0% had medium-high adherence to the Mediterranean diet; physical activity was high, with a median energy expenditure of 34 metabolic equivalents (MET)s-h/week), and 16.8% were persistent with therapy. By contrast, cluster 3 (n = 108) comprised workers with the least healthy habits (100.0% were current or former smokers, adherence to the Mediterranean diet was low, and median energy expenditure was low, at 28.4 metabolic equivalents (MET)s-h/week).",fb48d967-3877-42ab-aa4b-410cefc93000
16,methods16," Moreover, all individuals in cluster 3 were non-persistent with therapy. Clusters 2 (n = 150) and 4 (n = 146) presented intermediate characteristics in relation to smoking, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, and physical activity. However, 100.0% of workers in cluster 2 were persistent with therapy, while none of the workers in cluster 4 were persistent.  Of the non-persistent individuals in clusters 1, 3, and 4, 17.7, 34.3, and 26.0%, respectively, corresponded to users who received one or several lipid-lowering drug prescription(s) at the index date but no additional prescriptions during the follow-up period.  The mean (SD) number of cigarettes per day was 12.81 (6.65), 15.15 (8.10), 15.08 (8.37), and 12.94 (7.99) for current smokers in clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.",b12f014e-c94e-4b70-bf0e-3cdfacc68dd4
17,methods17,"  Comparison of other characteristics between clusters (Table 2) revealed differences in the type of work performed: sedentary work was performed by a larger proportion of workers in cluster 1 and by a smaller proportion of workers in clusters 2 and 3.  Overweight and obesity were the only traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors for which significant differences were observed among clusters: cluster 2 contained a larger proportion (34.7%) of obese subjects, while the frequency of overweight was higher within clusters 3 and 4 (63.9 and 66.4%, respectively). Individuals within cluster 1 had a significantly lower cardiovascular score than those in the other clusters.  Comparison of healthcare utilization revealed that the number of visits to emergency services and hospitalizations was significantly lower in cluster 1 than in clusters 2 and 4, or in cluster 2, respectively.",53cad35b-c82d-4306-a660-e52a2bc7e026
18,methods18," The mean number of visits to primary care for cluster 1 was lower compared with the observed in cluster 4, while the mean number of visits to specialized care was also lower in cluster 1 compared with cluster 3.  Workers within cluster 1 had a significantly lower number and burden of chronic diseases than those in cluster 3. No differences were observed between clusters in terms of the number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) preventive co-treatments or pharmacological subgroups.  Comparison of healthcare utilization revealed that the number of visits to emergency services, hospital, and primary and specialized care was significantly lower in cluster 1 than the other clusters.  4. Discussion  This observational study examined a population of new lipid-lowering drug users with low morbidity, albeit high levels of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including hyperlipidaemia, smoking, and overweight and obesity, and overall poor persistence with lipid-lowering therapy.",22deb822-c8fe-436e-9a0c-0c534a154e74
19,methods19," Within this population, we identified four different profiles or clusters according to adherence to cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention recommendations. These clusters were defined based on the following variables: smoking status, diet, physical activity, and persistence with lipid-lowering therapy. Analysis of differences in sociodemographic, anthropometric, and clinical characteristics between the four clusters revealed particularly significant differences between clusters with the healthiest (cluster 1) and the least healthy (cluster 3) lifestyle behaviors. In cluster 1, the proportion of current or former smokers was lower, while adherence to the Mediterranean diet and daily practice of physical activity were higher. Moreover, in cluster 1 the daily energy intake, quality of the fats consumed, and alcohol intake were much more in line with medical recommendations than in cluster 3, in which these parameters were indicative of an unhealthy lifestyle.",a09b8b63-87b9-4acf-aad6-546e62253488
20,methods20,"  In agreement with the healthy adherer effect, none of the individuals in cluster 3 were persistent with lipid-lowering therapy. However, contrary to expectations only 16.8% of those in cluster 1 showed good persistence, while all subjects in cluster 2, in which lifestyles were not particularly healthy, were persistent. The hypothesis of risk compensation offers one possible explanation for these latter findings. According to this hypothesis, individuals who undergo a risk-lowering intervention are more likely to engage in risky behaviors because they feel that their level of risk is effectively reduced by the medication [31]. Studies of users of other treatments for chronic diseases, including osteoporotic fracture patients treated with bisphosphonate [9] and adults treated with antiepileptic drugs [32], have also reported no evidence of a healthy adherer effect.",c83e35dd-aa38-4be8-9674-41c468e66807
21,methods21,"  Our findings reveal the existence of different profiles among lipid-lowering drug users, who may adhere to therapy but not to healthy lifestyle behaviors necessary for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and vice versa. Halava et al. [33] noted that the association between lifestyle factors and non-adherence to statin therapy varied according to patient cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidity status. In their study of a large cohort of public sector employees, individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidities who had several unhealthy lifestyle behaviors were at increased risk of non-adherence. Conversely, overweight, obesity, and former smoking were predictors of better adherence among those without cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidities. Given that our study population is relatively young, with low levels of morbidity, we were unable to investigate this association.",46a9ef8b-34c7-4b41-94e9-d20afe01dc49
22,methods22,"  The highest cardiovascular score was observed for lipid-lowering drug users who did not follow medication recommendations and only partially followed lifestyle recommendations. This high risk is probably influenced by the high frequency of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors other than hyperlipidaemia in our study population. Early detection of individuals with this profile would facilitate implementation of motivational education programs to improve lifestyle and medication-related behaviors and the ability to adopt and maintain good cardiovascular disease (CVD) self-management practices [6]. In this sense, interventions designed to increase the level of persistence should always take into account the multifactorial nature of this phenomenon [34].",ec883b2d-ccfc-4676-8646-2f881efee8d0
23,methods23," Some possible explanations for non-persistence in our study cohort include the appearance of adverse effects associated with the new drug, as well as the asymptomatic nature of hyperlipidaemia, which results in a lack of awareness of the consequences of non-persistence. Our findings also point to a potential role of rotating shift work as a determinant of poor persistence, although no previous studies appear to have investigated this association. It has been widely demonstrated that a low educational level is predictive of poor long-term adherence [35,36]. In contrast, we found that the only cluster in which all subjects were persistent was the cluster with the highest proportion of workers who had only completed primary studies. These results were, however, not statistically significant. Furthermore, in cluster 1, in which the frequency of sedentary work (i.e., office work that requires a higher educational level) was higher, less than one fifth of subjects were persistent.",e7b9442f-8f54-4401-a937-4fa2675c3bfd
24,methods24," While our results do not demonstrate an association between a higher educational level and better persistence with medication, they show that individuals with a high educational level (cluster 1) had an overall healthier lifestyle, as well as a lower frequency of overweight or obesity, a lower burden of morbidity, and a lower cardiovascular score than subjects in other clusters. Moreover, cluster 1 had a lower number of visits to emergency services, primary and specialized care, and fewer hospitalizations. Longer follow-up as our population ages will be required to confirm the differences observed between clusters. In their study of Spanish adults with a mean age at baseline of 68.6 years, Hernandez-Aceituno et al. [37] reported a statistically lower risk of polypharmacy and fewer visits to the primary care physician and hospitalizations in subjects with 5–6 healthy behaviors than in those with 0–1 healthy behaviors.",5b08bb97-c7ca-4125-910e-2ae8d7a58a29
25,methods25," The authors found no association between healthy behaviors and visits to medical specialists.  The literature regarding the association between adherence to medication and healthcare utilization and, consequently, healthcare expenditure, is contradictory. Simon-Tuval et al. [12] reported that initiation of therapy with cardiovascular disease (CVD) preventive drugs by adherent patients was followed by a decrease in total healthcare costs, mainly owing to a decrease in hospitalizations. In partially- and non-adherent individuals, the authors observed no significant changes in annual healthcare costs after beginning therapy. Conversely, in their study of a Spanish cohort of 1.7 million individuals who were prescribed a new medication in 2012, Aznar-Lou et al. [38] found that patients who were initially non-adherent to chronic medication showed a lower use of healthcare services than initially adherent patients. Brookhart et al.",1f392a3d-f527-4f93-82a3-58e21741e4f1
26,methods26," [14] examined the association between adherence to statin therapy and the use of preventive health services in a cohort of 20,783 new users of statins in Pennsylvania. After adjustment for age, sex, and various comorbid conditions, patients who adhered to therapy showed higher subsequent use of preventive health services such as prostate-specific antigen tests, faecal occult blood tests, screening mammograms, influenza vaccinations, and pneumococcal vaccinations. Costs associated with preventive tests requested by more compliant patients are unlikely to exceed, in the medium and long term, those associated with co-treatments, diagnostic tests, visits to a general practitioner, specialist physician, emergency department, or hospitalizations required when a patient presents a high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Further research, comparing the true healthcare expenditure in both adherent and non-adherent patients will be of interest.",3bca86ac-13cc-4711-9d8c-1a581e406b68
27,methods27," In any case, maintaining good control of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors from young ages is essential to avoid cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbimortality. One study of a longitudinal cohort of industrial employees from Chicago aged 18–74 found that favorable cardiovascular disease (CVD) health at younger ages increased survival by almost 4 years and delayed the onset of all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity by 4.5 and 7 years, respectively, resulting in lower healthcare costs [39].  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess clusters of young healthy subjects classified according to their adherence to both medication and healthy lifestyle behaviors.",32be863d-66aa-48ef-8f49-9d96f94920a1
28,methods28," The availability of individual, clinical and drug utilization data, as well as healthcare utilization data in populations of this size is uncommon, and provides a rare opportunity to examine numerous conditions and variables and obtain a snapshot of the different profiles of users of cardiovascular disease (CVD) preventive drugs. Further strengthening our findings, the data sources used contain validated data that have been previously analyzed in published studies [15,27].  Limitations of the present study should be borne in mind. First, both the unique profile of the study population according to its sociodemographic characteristics, as well as the voluntary sampling approach complicate extrapolation of results to general population. Nevertheless, extrapolation would be possible in the case of young and healthy men.",85459064-6288-41b0-b8d3-c136201bee38
29,methods29," In this regard, the observed levels of adherence to cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention recommendations, especially to medication, appear in line with those reported in previous population studies. Second, the assessment of diet and physical activity consisted of personal interviews using questionnaires that, although validated, can lead to some misclassification of subjects, as occurs in most diet- and exercise-related studies. The low numbers of comorbidities, co-treatments, and healthcare utilization in the different clusters hindered the detection of statistically significant differences. These low numbers were largely due to the young age and good health status of the study population. Consequently, longer follow-up should be performed in future studies, which should also analyze in greater detail the evolution of persistence with lipid-lowering medication within each cluster and would likely reduce the presence of confounders that may have influence the results in health.",2fa656ee-5dd6-415e-ba73-907a10ad9ede
30,methods30," For instance, it may be informative to differentiate between subjects based on the purpose of the visit (e.g., assistance or prevention). Additionally, information on the statin dosing regimen prescribed, the provision of advice by health professionals other than physicians or the family’s habits and lifestyle would be of interest to better interpret the results found. Finally, a common limitation of analyses of drug-dispensing data is the assumption that the purchase of a drug equates to its consumption. We assessed drug-taking behavior by analyzing persistence with therapy, which is considered a more appropriate indicator than adherence, as it takes into account the continuity of the patient’s purchasing of medication [27]. Nonetheless, development of a standard method for assessing persistence with medication is needed.  5.",c455b12d-5aa5-49c7-9d60-42c8e3eebc7c
31,methods31," Conclusions  Individual control of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors requires adherence to heart-healthy recommendations relating to both lifestyle and persistence with medication. In our young, active, and healthy population, in which lipid-lowering therapy was initiated for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), we observed four distinct profiles or aggregations. The “healthy adherer effect” was only observed in some of these profiles.  These findings raise doubts as to the appropriateness of recommending a single set of actions for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in healthy population. The influence of educational level on adherence to both medication and a healthy lifestyle should be further analyzed in depth.  A wealth of interventions to improve the employees’ health are usually implemented at the workplace.",c47c321d-a679-4da9-bc23-cc7d740e94f0
32,methods32," However, further efforts are needed to determine how to provide effective and adjusted advice that promotes behavioral change and allocate the necessary resources according to the worker’s profile or needs. This would facilitate the creation of healthy environments and, consequently, the achievement of better health outcomes in both healthy and high-risk populations.
