0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Participants  Based on the child cohort (PROC) study, we enrolled 1914 children aged 6 to 8 years attending primary school in Beijing, China (detailed elsewhere [24]). We conducted 4 waves of urine assays from October 2018 to November 2019 (detailed elsewhere [25,26]). In brief, the first wave of urine assays was performed from October to November 2018 and waves 2–4 were performed within one week in November 2019 (see details elsewhere [27]). All participants provided at least one urine sample, for a sample size of 6968 visits across 4 waves.  2.2. Urine Collection and Measurements  The urine collection and measurement procedures are detailed elsewhere [25,26]. Briefly, we performed a baseline fasting urine assay for wave 1, a 24 h urine assay (Sunday through Monday morning) for wave 2, a Wednesday fasting urine assay for wave 3 and a Friday fasting urine assay for wave 4. Urinary β2-MG and MA excretion were measured in waves 1–4. An elevated β2-MG > 0.",7b5d14eb-98a9-44d6-b758-2389f2a97d76

Assessment of Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet  The 16-item Mediterranean Diet Quality Index in children and adolescents (KIDMED) [13] was used to assess Mediterranean diet adherence among children aged 6–8 years at baseline. A total of 12 items with positive implications for the Mediterranean diet were designated with a +1 value, while 4 items with a negative meaning were designated with a −1 value. The summed index ranged from 0 to 12 points and can be classified into 3 grades: (1) 0–3, low Mediterranean diet adherence; (2) 4–7, intermediate Mediterranean diet adherence (needs to be improved); (3) 8–12, optimal/good Mediterranean diet adherence.  2.4.",76157392-bbf7-4acf-a110-d23e88c6fee6
2,methods2," Data Collection of Covariates  Anthropometric measurements including weight, height, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) were analyzed in this study. Height z-scores, weight z-scores and body mass index (BMI) z-scores were calculated using 2007 WHO criteria, and age- and sex-specific systolic blood pressure (SBP) z-scores were determined. Lifestyle covariates included sleep duration, screen time and physical activity by parental self-administrated questionnaires (Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire [Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)] [30,31]; the Chinese version of the Children’s Leisure Activities Study Survey [CLASS-C] [25,32]). A sleep duration of <10 h/d was used to define short sleep. Computer/cell-phone screen time of ≥2 h/d was used to define long screen time. Physical activity of <1 h/d was used to define insufficient physical activity [25].",30c41a94-9699-45d5-b7d5-89b8b2b0a461
3,methods3,"  2.5. Statistical Analysis  The main outcomes were the repeated measurements of urinary β2-MG and MA excretion and the categorical transient renal tubular and glomerular impairment. Descriptive statistics are presented according to the KIDMED index (Mediterranean diet adherence). Variables with missing values were handled using multiple imputations, and a total of 50 complete datasets were generated for the final analysis. Sex or lifestyle covariates are presented as counts and percentages. Z-scores of height, weight and body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are described as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and urinary β2-MG and MA excretion are described as median and interquartile range (interquartile range (IQR)). The χ2 test, analysis of variance and Kruskal–Wallis test were performed to compare the differences between the three groups of poor, intermediate, and good adherence to the Mediterranean diet.",841e07a1-c140-4d1b-8b2d-1646b788c93a
4,methods4," We generated linear mixed-effects models to determine the associations between renal impairment indicators and KIDMED scores with estimated coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The longitudinal associations of kidney impairment and KIDMED index were determined using generalized linear mixed-effects models with crude and adjusted odds ratios (cOR and aOR) and 95%CIs. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex, age, body mass index (BMI) z-score, systolic blood pressure (SBP) z-score, screen time, sleep duration and physical activity level, while the weekday of the urine assay was included as a random effect. The results in Table 1 are based on the first imputed dataset, while Table 2 and Table 3 and Figure 1 contain valid statistical inferences of the parameters based on 50 datasets using PROC MIANALYZE, and Table 4 is also based on the first imputed dataset.

Sociodemographic Characteristics  This study enrolled 1914 children of 6.6 ± 0.3 years old with 7 ± 2 scores of KIDMED test at baseline. Poor, intermediate, and good adherence rates for the Mediterranean diet were 9.0% (KIDMED index 0–3), 54.4% (KIDMED index 4–7) and 36.5% (KIDMED index 8–12), respectively. A short sleep duration was more prevalent in children with lower Mediterranean diet adherence, while there were no significant differences in sex, age, height z-score, weight z-score, body mass index (BMI) z-score, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), long screen time or insufficient physical activity between the three groups. We observed significant differences between the three groups in wave 3 of the urinary β2-MG excretion, and in waves 1–2 of the urinary MA excretion between the three groups (Table 1).",91e91f52-6e3f-4a32-ae75-6f0f3a562a9b
6,methods6," The prevalence of transient renal tubular impairment (elevated β2-MG > 0.2 mg/L) was 8.8% (168 of 1914), 15.9% (277 of 1746), 25.7% (425 of 1651) and 29.0% (481 of 1657) from wave 1 to 4, while that of transient renal glomerular impairment (elevated MA ≥ 20 mg/L) was 5.6% (107 of 1914), 5.5% (96 of 1746), 4.4% (72 of 1651) and 4.1% (68 of 1657), respectively.  3.2. Linear Associations of Kidney Impairment Indicators with KIDMED Scores  Linear mixed-effects models were generated to determine associations between the indicators of kidney impairment and the KIDMED scores. The results in the unadjusted model 1 and the adjusted model 2 (adjusting for sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) z-score) showed that the urinary MA excretion was associated with the KIDMED score, whereas the urinary β2-MG excretion was not significantly associated with the KIDMED score. The adjusted model 3 showed that a higher urinary MA excretion was inversely associated with a higher KIDMED score (β = −0.",73f4432a-aa2c-49c7-b1bb-855a100500e0

Longitudinal Associations of Kidney Impairment with KIDMED Index  The results of the generalized linear mixed-effects models were consistent with the linear models. As the KIDMED index increased (with better Mediterranean diet adherence), the children were less likely to develop renal glomerular impairment. For renal tubular impairment, we did not observe a significant longitudinal association with the KIDMED index. In the unadjusted model 1 and the adjusted model 2 (adjusting for sex, age and body mass index (BMI) z-score), taking the KIDMED index 0–3 as a reference, the effect of the KIDMED index 4–7 on renal glomerular impairment showed marginal significance, while the effect of the KIDMED index 8–12 showed consistent significance.",3a734098-e0fe-4072-8190-e7ec40e2850b
8,methods8," The results from model 3 showed the likelihood of renal glomerular impairment among children with intermediate Mediterranean diet adherence (aOR = 0.68, 95%CI: 0.47, 0.99, p = 0.044) and those with good Mediterranean diet adherence (aOR = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.40, 0.90, p = 0.014), adjusting for sex, age, body mass index (BMI) z-score, systolic blood pressure (SBP) z-score, screen time, sleep duration, and physical activity (Table 3).  3.4. Longitudinal Associations of Kidney Impairment with KIDMED Test  We further presented the frequency of children with kidney impairment in terms of each item of the KIDMED test (Table 4) and the association of kidney impairment with each item of KIDMED test (Figure 1). Adjusting for sex, age, body mass index (BMI) z-score, systolic blood pressure (SBP) z-score, screen time, sleep duration, and physical activity, renal tubular impairment was less likely to occur among those that consumed pasta or rice almost every day (aOR = 0.77, 95%CI: 0.61, 0.98, p = 0.",f293e3f0-f1fe-42b8-a97a-b42400ce2f7d

Children who took sweets and candy several times every day had a greater risk to develop renal glomerular impairment (aOR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.18, 2.15, p = 0.003) (Figure 1).  4. Discussion  The study used longitudinal data from the general pediatric population in China with a considerably large sample size to determine the associations between Mediterranean diet adherence (assessed using the KIDMED index) and transient kidney impairment. We found that children with a higher KIDMED index were less likely to develop renal glomerular impairment. Good adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a 40% lower risk of having renal glomerular impairment, after adjusting for demographic and lifestyle covariates, including sex, age, body mass index (BMI) z-score, systolic blood pressure (SBP) z-score, screen time, sleep duration and physical activity.",b520ce01-8d2d-4990-93ba-2b7895af3950
10,methods10," This finding underscores a major need for early development and adherence to a healthy eating pattern to enhance kidney health in children.  Poor, intermediate, and good adherence rates for the Mediterranean diet were 9.0% (KIDMED index 0–3), 54.4% (KIDMED index 4–7) and 36.5% (KIDMED index 8–12), respectively, while the proportions in the KIDMED-developed population of Spanish children aged 2–14 years were 2.9%, 48.6% and 48.5% [13]. The rate differences suggest slightly lower Mediterranean diet adherence compared with Spanish children. Studies on the assessment of Mediterranean diet adherence have mainly been conducted among Mediterranean European countries such as Spain, Greece, Chile, Portugal, Lebanon and Italy with mean KIDMED scores ranging from 5 to 8 [8], which is similar to our mean KIDMED scores of 7. These results demonstrate the good applicability of the KIDMED in the Chinese pediatric population.",2b862efd-5ba0-4122-a40c-b51f5f704c4e
11,methods11," Moreover, we observed that a short sleep duration was more prevalent in the context of lower Mediterranean diet adherence. A cross-sectional study among 503 university students reported that good Mediterranean diet adherence was associated with overall good sleep quality and sleep composition, which was associated with the intake of foods rich in melatonin, tryptophan and phytonutrients [33].  For the linear association of the indicators of kidney impairment and the Mediterranean diet adherence, we observed a consistent longitudinal negative association between the KIDMED score and urinary MA excretion in the unadjusted analyses, with respect to the adjusted sex, age, body mass index (BMI) z-score, systolic blood pressure (SBP) z-score, screen time, sleep duration and physical activity. This result is consistent with a cross-sectional study of Greek adolescents that reported an inverse correlation between the KIDMED score and albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR, r = −0.111, p = 0.",60ce8d36-6a08-4340-9911-28b8b89d8319
12,methods12,"041) [11]. The kidney contributes to many physiological and biological mechanisms in the body [34], while microalbuminuria (renal glomerular impairment) is associated with systemic inflammation of the body and endothelial dysfunction [35]. Early damage to the glomerular filtration barrier results in impaired size and charge selectivity, leading to increased MA excretion [36]. One pathophysiological explanation for this negative correlation is that the Mediterranean diet has the endothelial protective and anti-atherosclerotic properties [11,37]. No significant longitudinal associations between the KIDMED score and urinary β2-MG excretion were observed. The difference in the molecular mass of β2-MG (11.8 kDa) and MA (67 kDa) partly explains the differences associated with the Mediterranean diet, i.e., the excretion of MA requires more extensive impairment [38].",60bb0037-04a5-4e94-a1bd-0cc0b17cf018
13,methods13," Furthermore, studies have shown that increased glomerular albumin leakage stimulates proinflammatory and profibrotic signals that directly lead to tubulointerstitial impairment [36]. The exposure of renal tubules to albumin triggers inflammatory responses and toxic effects, leading to interstitial impairment, fibrosis and dysfunction, ultimately resulting in irreversible kidney impairment [36,39]. Therefore, Mediterranean diet adherence may play a broader and more important role in preventing kidney damage.  We further assessed the longitudinal association between transient kidney impairment and Mediterranean diet adherence and validated the stability of the inverse association between renal glomerular impairment and Mediterranean diet adherence.",d344a269-48d8-4ede-90f9-a92688a679e6
14,methods14," We found that children with moderate or good Mediterranean diet adherence had a 32% and 40% lower risk of glomerular impairment, respectively, compared with children with low Mediterranean diet adherence, adjusting for sex, age, body mass index (BMI) z-score, systolic blood pressure (SBP) z-score, screen time, sleep duration and physical activity level. This result provides quantitative evidence for evaluating the direct effect of the Mediterranean diet on glomerular impairment in children. We found a similar non-significant negative association between renal tubular impairment and Mediterranean diet adherence. A further breakdown of the 16-item KIDMED test analysis revealed that eating pasta or rice almost every day was associated with a 23% lower risk of renal tubular impairment. China is a country with a traditional grain-based diet, and most children eat grains more than once a day [4,12], which may be related to the protection of the renal tubular system.",1feb892f-b1c9-4994-8d3e-148746b44620
15,methods15," We also identified two unhealthy eating habits as leading causes of transient kidney impairment, namely, skipping breakfast increases the risk of tubular impairment by 35% and eating sweets and candies several times a day increases glomerular impairment by 59%. While we did not expect children in Beijing or in China to have absolute adherence to the Mediterranean diet, the KIDMED test involving many healthy compositions are similar to the traditional Chinese dietary pattern or other healthy diet patterns. In this perspective, using KIDMED advocates a healthy dietary pattern rather than promoting a Mediterranean diet per se. The early development of healthy eating patterns and the correction of unhealthy eating habits will help protect kidney health in the general pediatric population with respect to healthy lifestyles.",08e6a0a8-33fd-41cf-bf58-6c0e98885890
16,methods16,"  The major strength of this study was that we used the quantified tool of the KIDMED index to assess Mediterranean diet adherence, thus ensuring the stability of the results. However, our findings are based on the original version of the KIDMED questionnaire [13], and there was a revision in 2019 to emphasize the benefits of consuming whole fruit rather than fruit juice and whole grains [40]. We used appropriate statistical methods such as imputation methods [41] for missing data, linear mixed-effects models for linear associations and generalized linear mixed-effects models for longitudinal associations, to maximize longitudinal information and avoid reporting bias. In addition, we selected and adjusted for key covariates such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and lifestyle factors to assess the effect of the Mediterranean diet on transient kidney impairment.",85dbc5d2-3cf1-4ab3-a3aa-2012d809e04f
17,methods17," This study was limited by not considering the potential interaction of the two outcomes and other factors of renal function. Urine β2-MG and MA excretion were tested by different machines across the study waves, but longitudinal data minimized these effects.  5. Conclusions  We present the longitudinal associations of transient kidney impairment with Mediterranean diet adherence in the general Chinese pediatric population. We found that children who adhered to a Mediterranean diet were associated with a reduced risk of transient renal glomerular impairment. Our findings underscore the necessity of the early development of healthy diet patterns and the correction of unhealthy eating habits in children to protect kidney health in the context of more relevant healthy lifestyles.
