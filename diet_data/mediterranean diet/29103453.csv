0,introduction0,"Modification of overall dietary patterns rather than individual dietary attributes are proposed as a more effective approach for cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) prevention and intervention.1 Based on clinical trial evidence,2,3 prospective cohort studies,4,5,6 recommendations of the American Heart Association7 and the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans,8 a Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean diet (MED)) pattern is associated with prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), even in non-Mediterranean populations.  Two European randomized clinical trials conducted in Mediterranean countries examined a Mediterranean diet (MED) intake intervention vs a control diet and found significant reductions in clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.",25d55a0e-fc96-4db8-922e-011b745b3450
1,introduction1," In the Lyon Diet Heart trial, 605 French men with a first myocardial infarction (MI) were randomized to Mediterranean diet (MED) intervention vs American Heart Association Step 1 control diet, resulting in 50% to 70% lower relative risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD).9 Most of the measured intermediate cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarkers (including traditional lipids) were similar between the study groups.10 Subsequently, the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMediterranean diet (MED))) trial found that a Mediterranean diet (MED) intervention enriched with nuts or extra-virgin olive oil reduced first cardiovascular disease (CVD) events by 30% compared with a control low-fat diet in a high-risk Spanish primary prevention population.",ecbc75d3-c06f-45fc-a12d-12ad35872cbc
2,introduction2,"2,3 The Mediterranean diet (MED) in this Spanish population at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) was associated with favorable changes in several cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including reduced levels of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (low density lipoproteins (LDL)) and triglycerides (TG), increases in high-density lipoproteins (high density lipoproteins (HDL)), and improvements in blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and circulating inflammatory molecules,11 but it is unclear which of these favorable changes may mediate the Mediterranean diet (MED) benefit on cardiovascular disease (CVD) event reduction. No significant weight reduction was observed in either 3 months or 1 year of intervention in the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMediterranean diet (MED)) study.",671b58f5-cea4-4ab2-b50f-26e5faf3cd86
3,introduction3,"11,12 Recently, the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMediterranean diet (MED)) study’s original findings3 have been retracted and republished,13 although the republished results are consistent with the previously reported findings for Mediterranean diet (MED) benefit.  No randomized trials of Mediterranean diet (MED) intervention have been conducted in the United States for clinical outcomes. Observational studies in US populations have reported that a 20-percentile higher Mediterranean diet (MED) intake was associated with 9% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in short-term follow-up of up to 4 years.14 It is uncertain whether Mediterranean diet (MED) intake protects against cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in US populations over the long term.  Furthermore, the precise mechanisms through which Mediterranean diet (MED) intake is associated with reduction in long-term risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events are not well understood.",5b412aa6-5684-4692-9eca-a667286da249
4,introduction4," Therefore, we aimed to (1) examine whether higher Mediterranean diet (MED) intake was associated with lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) event risk in a US population of initially healthy individuals with long-term (>10 years) follow-up, and (2) better characterize and quantify the relative contribution of a panel of 40 traditional and novel factors to the Mediterranean diet (MED)-associated risk reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.

The study population is derived from the Women’s Health Study, as reported previously.15,16,17 Briefly, 39 876 female health professionals aged 45 years or older and free from cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline (1991-1995) were randomized to either to low-dose aspirin or vitamin E. In the Women’s Health Study, 28 345 female participants provided baseline blood samples. For the current analyses, we included 25 994 participants, after excluding participants with missing information for any biomarkers (n = 1614) or Mediterranean diet (MED) intake assessed from semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaires (n = 737). To assess the dietary pattern, a validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire including 131 food items was administered to study participants at baseline.",81b5d5b3-d9e2-412f-9fd3-80ec7c793a3a

Self-reported weight and height were reported, and body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also reported at baseline. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study protocols were approved by the Partners Institutional Review Board, Boston, Massachusetts.  Mediterranean diet (MED) Score The Mediterranean diet (MED) score ranges from 0 to 9, with a higher score representing better adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED).",b42d2bf8-f498-4069-87b6-9fd73b346057

Blood Collection and Measurement of Biomarkers At baseline, blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes, which were centrifuged and stored at −170°C until analyses were performed. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was quantified with an immunoturbidometric assay (Roche Diagnostics).

12,methods7,"27 We first tested the significance of the association of Mediterranean diet (MED) intake with cardiovascular disease (CVD), and then retested the association in a separate model with each potential mediator. Models were adjusted for the confounders age, randomized treatment assignment, and energy intake (Table 1 and Table 2). Next, we evaluated the magnitude of the change in the HRs for the highest vs lowest Mediterranean diet (MED) intake group, with and without adjustment for each mediator (Table 3 and Table 4). A larger change in the HR toward the null implies a larger mediating effect of the risk factor on the association between Mediterranean diet (MED) intake and reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Then, on an a priori basis, we grouped together a set of variables that are generally considered to be potential confounders rather than mediators (smoking [never, former, and current], menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, exercise, and parental history of MI).",c6823e11-83af-40b2-8af2-7c6ad3767379

Also on an a priori basis, we grouped other risk factors generally considered to be potential mediators into sets on the basis of their pathophysiological effects. For example, to analyze the combined effects of traditional lipids, we combined total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins (LDL)-C, high density lipoproteins (HDL)-C, and TG as 1 set. We combined Lp(a), apo AI, and apo B100 as 1 set. Fibrinogen, hsCRP, ICAM-1, and glycoprotein acetylation were combined together as 1 set considering their role in inflammation.

32,discussion0,"Although Mediterranean diet (MED) intake has been associated with the reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in observational and interventional studies, it is unclear whether Mediterranean diet (MED) intake is associated with long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefit in US populations, and what would be the underlying biological mechanisms that may mediate this benefit. In the current study conducted in a large initially healthy population of US women, we observed that higher Mediterranean diet (MED) intake was associated with approximately one-quarter lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events over a 12-year follow-up period. Furthermore, the benefit could be explained in part by known risk factors, both traditional and novel. Inflammation explained the largest proportion (29.2%) of the reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD), followed by glucose metabolism and insulin resistance (27.9%), body mass index (BMI) (27.3%), blood pressure (26.",1e85fcba-b9a8-41d0-be93-2c83297e7654
33,discussion1,"6%), traditional lipids (26.0%), and measures of high density lipoproteins (HDL) (24.0%) and Vlow density lipoproteins (LDL) (20.8%) metabolism, with lesser contributions from low density lipoproteins (LDL), BCAAs, or other biomarkers. In total, these results show that these risk factors explained part of the association, but additional unmeasured factors may also contribute.  Previous studies on intermediate outcomes (but not clinical events) have demonstrated favorable effects of adherence to Mediterranean diet (MED) intake on cardiometabolic biomarkers including metabolic syndrome,34 improved insulin resistance,35 lower hsCRP and interleukin-6,36 and glucose metabolism.",4cf15ef4-2456-48d9-afbf-3542aa276ca3
34,discussion2,"37 The Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMediterranean diet (MED)) trial showed that clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) events may be reduced by approximately 30%,3 but the underlying mechanisms related to the protective association of Mediterranean diet (MED) intake with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is not well defined. Our findings support the role of Mediterranean diet (MED) on modifying inflammatory biomarkers, as we estimated that 29.2% of the Mediterranean diet (MED) benefit was related to inflammation. A recent study reported that hydroxytyrosol (found in fruits, nuts, legumes, and extra-virgin olive oil) repairs cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related oxidative damage and improves blood lipids.38 Likewise, in a substudy of 778 participants in Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMediterranean diet (MED)), Mediterranean diet (MED) intake was associated with improvements in cellular and circulating anti-inflammatory properties.",00d3ce8c-a16e-48f3-ac5a-34a30f837226
35,discussion3,"39 In a 2-year follow up of randomized treatment intervention with Mediterranean diet (MED), Esposito et al36 reported significant improvements in hsCRP and endothelial function compared with the control diet. Dai et al40 also reported that reduced inflammation is an important mechanism linking the intake of Mediterranean diet (MED) and lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.  We also observed the attenuation of the association of Mediterranean diet (MED) intake on cardiovascular risk through pathways related to glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, adiposity, blood pressure, traditional lipids, high density lipoproteins (HDL) and Vlow density lipoproteins (LDL) measures, and, to a lesser extent, low density lipoproteins (LDL) size and particles, but not low density lipoproteins (LDL) or total cholesterol. Similarly, Park et al41 reported that obesity mediates the association between Mediterranean diet (MED) intake on insulin resistance and inflammation biomarkers.",7c8602c2-1bbf-40ce-bfe7-7c91334fa60c
36,discussion4," It has been reported that components of Mediterranean diet (MED), including peanuts and walnuts, can reduce lipids.42 We also observed that 24.0% of the association between Mediterranean diet (MED) and reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) was explained by high density lipoproteins (HDL) measures. Similarly, in the subsample of the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMediterranean diet (MED)) study, Mediterranean diet (MED) adherence was associated with increased high density lipoproteins (HDL) ability to esterify cholesterol and high density lipoproteins (HDL) vasodilatory capacity.43  The beneficial association with Mediterranean diet (MED) intake was stronger for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) than for total stroke in the current study, but the relative contribution of different mediator groups was comparable. A recent meta-analysis also observed weaker or null association between Mediterranean diet (MED) intake and stroke.",660a5064-f1eb-4655-92e6-ecb1bd0593e5
37,discussion5,"44  The Mediterranean diet (MED) score is based on the published literature and our a priori hypothesis. A diet score involves some level of arbitrary cut points in terms of which components it contains and the assignment of scores to different levels of intake. Although the Mediterranean diet (MED) score that we used in the current study is very similar to what has been reported in the literature about the choice of food items, there are some differences. The score used by Trichopoulou et al45 and Pitsavos et al46 also included potato intake, and Trichopoulou et al45 also included dairy products.  The current study has several advantages, including its prospective design, large sample size, detailed information about Mediterranean diet (MED) intake and measured biomarkers that range from conventional to novel risk pathways, and the long follow-up.  Limitations There are several limitations that need to be acknowledged.",4689a797-3592-4936-93fc-4ebbfc2ea81d
38,discussion6," We cannot rule out the possibility of residual confounding related to unmeasured cardiovascular disease (CVD) factors. Dietary intake was assessed through food frequency questionnaires, as self-reported diet intake might lead to exposure misclassification, including underreporting and overreporting, although that would attenuate the Mediterranean diet (MED)-cardiovascular disease (CVD) association toward the null. It is possible that some of the covariates, including hypertension, may be influenced by Mediterranean diet (MED) intake, which suggests that these variables could be confounders or mediators. Study participants were US female health care professionals who might have different behaviors than men or higher-risk individuals.",c6484185-cae2-4f1f-9946-ed927e286d6f
39,discussion7,"  Conclusions Our results suggest that a proportion of the lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events with Mediterranean diet (MED) intake may be accounted for by known factors related to inflammation, glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and lipids (in particular high density lipoproteins (HDL) and Vlow density lipoproteins (LDL)). Despite this, a sizeable proportion of the potential benefit of Mediterranean diet (MED) intake with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction remains unexplained and requires future investigation into additional mechanisms.
