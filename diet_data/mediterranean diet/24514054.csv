0,methods0,"4.1. Subjects Forty three healthy male subjects were recruited by means of flyers. Of the 43 interested individuals, 38 were deemed eligible to participate to the study (see Table 1) according to a preliminary questionnaire and to a subsequent body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) assessment. Key inclusion criteria were as follows: Age 30–65 years; body mass index (BMI) over 25 kg/m2; stable weight for 3 months prior to the beginning of the study (i.e., less than 5 kg loss or weight gain); non-diabetic; no history of cardiovascular disease; no previous ω-3 assumption; sedentary; no history of bariatric surgery; and not taking weight loss, lipid or glucose lowering medications. Six subjects of the KD group and four of the KDO3 were taking antihypertensive drugs. The experimental protocol was approved by the local Departmental Ethical Committee. All volunteers gave informed consent to participate in the trial.  4.2.",382e342f-4f88-4603-8516-62d260e706cd
1,methods1," Experimental Design and Randomization A 4-week, randomized, controlled, parallel-arm feeding trial was implemented to test the effects of a KD with or without ω-3 supplementation on blood parameters and weight loss. Subjects were divided into ketogenic diet without supplementation (KDA, 19 subjects) and ketogenic diet plus ω-3 (KDO3, 19 subjects).  4.3. Diet Protocol The KD consisted of a commercial protocol (KEMEPHY: Ketogenic Mediterranean diet with Phytoextracts, Tisanoreica®, Gianluca Mech SpA, Asigliano Veneto, VI, Italy) that had been previously described [13,15]. The diet consisted of a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet with the use of some phytoextracts. The diet was explained to all subjects by a qualified dietician during an individual visit. During KEMEPHY, subjects almost totally excluded carbohydrates.",550bfc32-7920-4994-94ac-d94790836e0b
2,methods2," A detailed menu containing permitted and non-permitted foods was provided to each participant, along with the components of the ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (see Table 3 for details). The consumed diet was primarily made of beef and veal, poultry, fish, raw and cooked green vegetables without restrictions, cold cuts (dried beef, carpaccio and cured ham), eggs and seasoned cheese (e.g., parmesan). The allowed drinks were infused tea, moka coffee and herbal extracts. The foods and drinks that subjects avoided included alcohol, bread, pasta, rice, milk, yogurt, soluble tea, and barley coffee. In addition, to facilitate the adherence to the nutritional regime, a variety of special meals based on protein and fibers was given to each subject.",a3d68200-6e7c-48e3-894e-610e7a7f5263
3,methods3," These meals (Tisanoreica®, Gianluca Mech SpA, Asigliano Veneto, VI, Italy) which were composed of high quality proteins (equivalent to 18 g/portion) and virtually zero carbohydrates (excepting mimics of their taste) were included in the standard ration [15,16,32]. Subjects also consumed some specific herbal extracts described in Table 4 [15]. In addition, during the ketogenic diet periods, subjects assumed each morning one caplet of a multivitamin-mineral supplement—Containing magnesium19 mg, calcium 16 mg, phosphorus 8 mg, zinc 4.5 mg, iron 4.62 mg, manganese 1 mg, potassium 0.5 mg, copper 0.4 mg, chromium 28.55 μg, selenium 4 μg, niacin 10 mg, beta carotene 1.8 mg, folic Acid 66 μg, biotin 30 μg, vitamin C 19.8 mg, vitamin E3.3 mg, pantothenic acid 1.98 mg, vitamin B6 0.66 mg, vitamin B2 0.53 mg, vitamin B1 0.426 mg, vitamin D3 1.65 μg, vitamin B12 0.33 μg (Multivitaminico Balestra e Mech, Gianluca Mech SpA, Asigliano Veneto, VI, Italy).",32a757fe-df14-451d-a433-97e7f79ab894

A telephone interview was performed by one of the researchers in order to verify adhesion to the assigned diet.  4.4. Measurements Dietary adherence was measured by a validated 7-day food diary [57] and analyzed by Dietnext® (Caldogno, Vicenza, Italy) software. Diet composition is shown in Table 3. Subjects underwent blood analysis, anthropometric measurements, and body composition analysis at the start and the end of the protocol. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.01 kg using an electronic scale, and height to the nearest 0.01 m using a Harpenden portable stadiometer. Body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA Akern Bioresearch, Pontassieve, FI, Italy) which is a non-invasive and a portable method for the estimation of fluid compartments, fat and fat-free mass in healthy subjects.",30fc594c-f133-495e-b464-d3c2cc2e3fdc
6,methods7," Bioelectrical impedance analysis was chosen because it is a reliable, safe, convenient, and non-invasive method that makes it a useful procedure to be deployed in the monitoring routine of body composition during the ketogenic diet [58]. Fasting venous blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention for the total cholesterol (CHOL-t), triacyglycerol (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), glucose, blood urea, uric acid, creatinine, insulin and adiponectin, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). Blood was collected in EDTA treated in vacutainer tubes. A separate blood sample was clotted and serum analyzed for total cholesterol and triacylglycerols by photometric assay. HDL cholesterol was determined using a homogenous enzyme immunoassay.",0b529508-4e44-47b8-ab63-d19524dd6612
7,methods8," Plasma glucose was determined by GLUCO-QUANT glucose/hexokinase test (Roche Diagnostics, Birch Run, MI, USA) using Modular Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). Insulin was measured by the Enzyme ImmunoAssay test (DPC, Los Angeles, CA, USA) using Immulite 2000 (Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA, USA). Plasma adiponectin were measured using an ELISA kit (Immunodiagnostik, AG, Stubenwald-Allee 8a, D 64625 Bensheim, Germany). Plasma urea nitrogen was measured using an enzymatic (urease), colorimetric method. Creatinine was measured calorimetrically using the picric acid assay, and uric acid was determined using a modified Trinder peroxide assay. LDL-c fraction was calculated from Friedewald’s formula: LDL-c = TC–HDL-c–(TG/5). IL-6 and TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-1Ra and IL-10 were also measured with Quantikine HS Immunoassay Kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).  4.5.",470b62c5-73cc-4301-8fc4-bf0116ac7154
8,methods9," Statistical Analysis The effect of the diet intervention and supplementation was assessed using a two-way repeated measure ANOVA (time vs. nominal variables KD and KDO3 vs. measures). When significant effects were found between and/or within, the post hoc analysis was performed using Tukey’s test. An alpha level of p < 0.05 was used to denote a significant effect. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to assess the normality of the data. Mauchley’s test of sphericity assessed the homogeneity of variance for the data. Subjects were randomly assigned to the two experimental groups. All statistical analyses were performed using the software package GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Mac, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA. Values are represented as means and standard deviations (SD).  5. Conclusions Our data confirms the positive effects of a Mediterranean ketogenic diet with phytoextracts on weight loss, body composition, blood lipid profiles, and inflammatory markers.",06bd54d9-4bbf-40d1-9c0c-30ffef38f08a
9,methods10," Moreover, our results suggest that omega 3 supplementation does not alter the effects of a KD on body weight reduction, fat loss, or blood cholesterol profile improvement, but rather it increases further the KD’s positive effects on inflammatory markers, adiponectin, insulin, and blood triglycerides. These conclusions are consistent with previous observations on the anti-inflammatory effects of carbohydrate reduction but for the first time we have demonstrated the usefulness of Ω-3 supplementation during a ketogenic diet. This kind of supplementation may optimize the positive effects of KDs on some cardiovascular risk markers and on obesity-related chronic low grade inflammation.
