0,methods0,"Intervention group: Starting in January 2017 we prospectively studied 26 new consecutive T1D onsets referred to the pediatric diabetes service of the University Hospital of Novara (AOU-Novara). Everyone received training on the Mediterranean diet, a cholecalciferol supplementation of 1000 IU/day, and within the first semester of overt disease, also was entered to ω-3 supplement of ultra-refined fish oil, equivalent to 60 mg/kg/day of eicosapentenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)).  Retrospective controls: All patients with T1D onset in 2014–2016 were admitted to the study as controls, after having received their parents’ written consent. One patient (n = 38) was excluded since he was the anecdotic case who received ω-3 supplementation before this study. Data were structured in a database.",5370e38b-fd85-4a35-8f4a-5a92a2c9a442
1,methods1," The patients had been introduced to the Mediterranean diet (as reported in the Supplementary Materials S1) and 1000 UI/day cholecalciferol supplementation since the first month of clinical disease, without a ω-3 supplement.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria: Patients with renal cysts or affected by sarcoidosis, histoplasmosis, hyperparathyroidism, lymphoma, and tuberculosis were excluded. T1D patients with thyroiditis and celiac disease following a gluten-free diet and who were tissue transglutaminase autoantibody (tTGA) negative were not excluded. Patients treated with drugs that could affect immunity or glucose metabolism, including corticosteroids, ciclosporin, and tacrolimus, were excluded.  Recruitment for the study took place from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2018. The intervention lasted one year for each case. This study was approved by the ethics committee of AOU Novara, and all patients’ parents signed the informed consent form.",8dfe5fbd-143d-466e-8d24-95ce40b8245b
2,methods2," This trial was registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov website (identifier: NCT03911843).  Diagnosis of T1D was performed according to the American Diabetes Association criteria [18]. Micro or macro vascular complications were defined according to the ISPAD criteria [19]. Children were evaluated using Italian growth charts [20]. At the onset of the disease, data on the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis, HbA1c%, insulin requirements, 25(OH)D levels, thyroid function, antibody titles of GADA, IAA, and IA-2, antibody patterns of celiac disease, and lipid profiles were collected. Evidence of ketoacidosis was assessed according to the ISPAD criteria [19], and severe DKA was considered if pH ≤7.1. The vitamin D status, as 25(OH)D levels, sufficiency, deficiency or insufficiency, were defined according to the Endocrine Society criteria, graded as sufficiency >30 ng/mL(>75 nmol/l), insufficiency 21–29 ng/mL(52.5–72.5 nmol/l), and deficiency ≤20 ng/mL(≤50 nmol/l) [21,22].",3aa77440-0b2f-42dd-a76b-ab0401091db2
3,methods3," The annual screening (blood count, lipid profile, urine test, thyroid function, and aPTT coagulation tests) was performed and evaluated at recruitment(T0) and twelve months later(T12). Blood glucose meters (Conturnext USB® Ascensia Diabetes Care) were supplied to the patients enrolled to standardize blood glucose measurements, and their data were downloaded with dedicated software (Glucofacts® Ascensia Diabetes Care, FreeStyleLibreLink®, Medtronic CareLink Pro®, Accu-ChekChekSmartPix®, Diasend® or Dexcom Clarity®). Clinical data, insulin demand, and laboratory analysis results were entered in a structured database.  2.1. Supplementations Supplementation of ω-3 was considered the intervention (T0).",90533c79-89ae-4811-9e7d-93a91c4dd72f
4,methods4," The preparation administered was a highly purified fish oil used in order to avoid pollutants, containing a mixture of omega 3 long chain fatty acids (ω-3 LCFA) standardized for contents of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), in capsules or in liquid form (Ener Zone Omega 3 RX® Equipe Enervit). A liquid preparation was used in the case of difficulties in swallowing capsules or concomitant celiac disease because it is certified as gluten-free. The preparations contained antioxidants to preserve ω-3 LCFA, tocopherol (1 mg in 1 g of ω-3 LCFA), palmitate, and rosemary extract. EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at 60 mg/kg/day were administered for 12 months. The supplementation goal was an AA/EPA ratio between 1.5–3. The investigation of AA/EPA ratios was performed in cases at enrollment (T0), and repeated after 3 (T3), 6 (T6), and 12 months (T12).",8c309000-6b61-441d-b997-d2d5613f1ce1
5,methods5,"  Cholecalciferol supplementation was fixed at 1000 IU/day (25 mcg/day), both in patients receiving supplementation and controls [21]. Vitamin D was determined as 25(OH)D level in patients receiving supplementation and controls at the clinical onset of T1D and at enrolment (T0). For patients receiving supplementation this continued at T3 and T12.  2.2. Diet At T1D clinical onset, a dietician provided a training courseon the Mediterranean diet [23]. The educational items were standardized [24] (see Supplementary Materials S1). A dietitian’s counseling was provided to each patient and accompanying parent every 3 months in order to sustain a Mediterranean diet over time. At T0, written materials were provided on the foods’ main source of PUFA, to sustain the intake of ω-3-rich foods (blue fish, nuts, walnuts, poultry, eggs, olive oil, flax seeds, and leafy vegetables) and limit food rich in ω-6 (beef, pork, and offal).",689309f6-f965-4e47-95a9-85fa8a5080d0
6,methods6,"  At T0 and T12, dietary intakes were assessed based on a weekly food diary and further interviews to determine macro and micronutrients intake as precisely as possible. The amounts of the nutrients have been evaluated with the support of the Food Composition Database for Epidemiological Studies (BDA version 1-2015) [23], assessing protein (g/day), energy (Kcal/day), cholesterol (mg/day), carbohydrates (g/day), dietary fiber (g/day), vitamin D (g/day), PUFA (g/day), arachidonic acid (AA g/day), EPA (g/day), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (g/day).  2.3. Assays Plasma glucose levels (mg/dl; 1 mg/dl:0.05551 mmol/liter) were measured by the gluco-oxidase colorimetric method (GLUCOFIX®, by Menarini Diagnostics, Florence, Italy). HbA1c% levels were measured through high-performance liquid chromatography (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)), using a Variant machine (Biorad, Hercules, CA) Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were, respectively, lower than 0.6% and 1.6%.",9a0ec8dd-5dd7-4516-af25-0a282ba6cc67
7,methods7," Linearity was excellent, from 3.2% (11 mmol/mol) to 18.3% (177 mmol/mol). The presence and titration of antibodies GAD65, IA2 and IAA, expressed in IU/mL, was carried out by immunoradiometric assay (immunoradiometric assay (IRMA)), with analytical coefficients of analysis of 13%, 8.4%, and 13%, respectively. The semi-quantitative determination of TGA, AGAD-G, and AGAD-A, expressed in IU/mL, was carried out on serum by QUANTA Flash, a rapid response immunochemiluminescence test (CIA) performed on the BIO-FLASH instrument. The coefficients of analytical variability were, respectively, 5.5%, 6.7%, and 4.3%. The quantitative determination of the anti-TG and anti-TPO autoantibodies, expressed in IU/mL, of the TSH, expressed in µUI/mL, and of the fT4, expressed in ng/dl, was performed by a competitive immunoassay using a direct immunochemiluminescence technique, using the Siemens ADVIA centaur XPT system.",9acf7549-d45c-4c96-96ad-3b242f7658e6
8,methods8,"  The circulating vitamin D levels were measured by serum 25(OH)D assay, using an immunochemiluminescence (CLIA) method (DiaSorin Liaison Test®, Stillwater, MN, USA). The coefficient of inter-individual variability of the method (CVa%) was 10%.  Fatty acids (AA, EPA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) percentages, and respective AA/EPA ratio) were determined by high-resolution capillary gas chromatography in whole blood, using dried blood spots testing [25].  The levels of circulating C-peptide, expressed in ng/mL, were measured, on citrate or heparinized plasma, both by chemiluminescent “sandwich” immunoassay (DiaSorin Liaison®) and by immunochemiluminescence with the automatic analyzer Immulite 2000 medical system, with a coefficient of variability of 7.4%.  To asses residual endogen insulin secretion (REIS), we used a composite index of insulin demand adjusted for metabolic control IDAA1c (calculated as insulin dose (UI/kg/24 h) × 4 + HbA1c%).",e3225219-368c-4162-8ee9-bba58d8915a2
9,methods9," A score of <9 met the definition of partial remission and residual endogen insulin secretion (REIS), according to the previous studies in TrialNet [26].  2.4. Statistical Analysis Data were expressed as mean ± SD of absolute values. The differences between groups were evaluated for the continuous variables through Mann-Whitney U tests. Chi-square tests were used to compare the nominal variables between groups. In supplemented subjects, the evaluation of variation between T0 and T12 for all metabolic parameters was performed with t-test for repeated measures. The association between the variables was evaluated according to a Pearson test, after proper logarithmic transformation of the parameters, if required. Trend evaluation across 25(OH)D levels was performed at the onset though multinomial regression analyses.",9904a960-ef6f-4dd4-9a9b-a6cc41687f9e
10,methods10," Moreover, in supplemented cases, a trend evaluation of metabolic parameters across each time point and timing of supplementation (T0 → T12) was performed though multinomial regression analyses. Significant p-values were less than 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  2.5. Patients At T0, we analyzed 64 patients (26 supplemented cases and 38 controls, Table 1), then the analysis during the time of the trial was carried out on 59 patients, whose observations (HbA1c%, average daily insulin needs (IU/Kg/day) and IDAA1c) were available from recruitment (T0), to 3, 6 and 12 (T12) months. Two cases were dropped because they were not adhering to therapy, two cases stopped because of ω-3 side effects, and one control was dropped because he changed residence. Finally, 59 patients were evaluated, 22 as supplemented cases and 37 as controls. Only the supplemented cases received ω-3 supplementation, as mentioned above.  3.",65c63280-b077-4fb6-8429-212a30832db1
11,methods11," Results At onset of T1D:Between the whole series (64) of T1D children, we found in 82.5% of cases a vitamin D insufficiency [≤30 ng/mL (≤75 nmol/L)] in T1D children at time of clinical onset of T1D. A severe deficiency ≤ 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L) was present in 12.7%, and those ones displayed a significantly lower fasting C peptide (FCP) level (p < 0.02) and pH (p < 0.02) than the others. Variability in pH (p < 0.01) and fasting C peptide (FCP) (p < 0.02) across vitamin D levels was observed.  Patients supplemented vs. not supplemented: At 12 months of ω-3 supplementation (T12), the cases (n = 22) showed significantly lower insulin needs than the controls (n = 37). In particular, lower daily insulin needs (0.49 ± 0.24 vs. 0.63 ± 0.19 IU/Kg/day; p < 0.01) and pre-meal bolus (0.22 ± 0.16 vs. 0.34 ± 0.14 IU/Kg/day: p < 0.01) were found, without differences in HbA1c% (NS). Analysis of the IDAA1c index at T12 showed IDAA1c < 9, consistent with a partial remission, in 12 of 22 (54.5%) cases vs.",35dccc6f-6b9d-424d-b86b-89e1acbeae24
12,methods12," 7 of 37 controls (18%; p < 0.01) (Figure 1, Table 2 and Table 3).  The Impact of the Diet The evaluation of diet composition was made only in cases receiving the ω-3 supplementation, comparing diet intakes at T0 and T12. It showed that within macronutrients, carbohydrate (p < 0.09), fiber (p < 0.05), and protein (p < 0.05) intakes were lower at T12 then T0. The micronutrients in the diet were similar for vitamin D, EPA, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (NS). However, the diet intake of AA was significantly lower (0.25 ± 0.1 vs. 0.20 ± 0.1 g/die; p < 0.01) at T12 vs. T0. The caloric intake was similar at the beginning and at the end of the one-year ω-3 administration (NS) (Table 4).  Correlations: At disease onset, 25(OH)D levels were correlated with pH (r: 0.359, p < 0.01). HbA1c% values were correlated with insulin daily requirement (r: 0.568, p < 0.0001) and weakly inversely correlated with pH (r: −0.245, p = 0.05).",6d38f669-cef8-461a-98d8-1f9894f9589c
13,methods13," The AA intake at starting point of ω-3 supplementation (T0) was inversely correlated with HbA1c% (p < 0.05, r: −0.411). After 12 months of ω-3 supplementation, vitamin D was inversely correlated with HbA1c% (p < 0.05, r: −0.462).  Limitations: There are several limitations to conclude on the efficacy of ω-3 in T1D children. (1) The study was not randomized; it is therefore a preliminary study to be finalized by subsequent randomized control trial (RCT)s. (2) The IDAA1c index is a surrogate of residual endogen insulin secretion (REIS) and not a direct evaluation of insulin secretion. (3) Controls are retrospective, so the comparability of series concerns only some data, such as HbA1c%, insulin needs, and IDAA1c, but not fasting C peptide (FCP), AA/EPA, and nutritional intakes. (4) The target AA/EPA levels weren’t reached with the doses assigned (Table 2).  Side effects: One female child reported diarrhea, so she stopped the fish oil supplement with a quick return to normality.",616796e6-87c7-4bce-80d7-c49141241f30
14,methods14," A female teenager with preexisting thyroiditis presented a transient suppression of TSH, which returned to normal values three months after ω-3 suspension. One male child at T12 showed a lengthening of clotting time (aPTT), the parameters returned gradually to the norm after suspension of ω-3 supplement without clinical signs of hemorrhage. No other side effects have been reported, no hemorrhagic clinical symptoms or manifestations that could lead one to suspect coagulation involvement.  4. Discussion In the management of T1D, there is a general agreement that the Mediterranean diet improves metabolic control [27], and the administration of vitamin D supplements avoids its deficiency [4]. A recent systematic review of vitamin D supplementation at the onset of T1D concluded that alphacalcidole and cholecalciferol supplementations have beneficial effects on daily insulin doses, HbA1c%, fasting C peptide (FCP), and stimulated C peptide (SCP).",3d98b778-4b14-4768-bbc5-27601454c091
15,methods15," In addition, it indicates that further randomized controlled trials based on biomarkers are needed to define their optimal contributions [28]. However, there are no directions to date on supplementation of ω-3 in young T1D subjects, despite some recent anecdotal data showing persistent partial remissions resulting from vitamin D and ω-3 co-supplementation introduced early after the disease onset [15,16,17]. Beyond these anecdotal cases, there is little scientific work on clinical outcomes of co-supplementation of vitamin D and ω-3 in recent-onset T1D. In this study involving a series of T1D children, already assuming a Mediterranean diet and cholecalciferol, the additional supplement of ω-3 in recent-onset cases seemed to have beneficial effects, which suggests the need to design further randomized control trial (RCT)s.",4b6aed02-9e98-4dfc-bf79-0760ac793e7d
16,methods16,"  Our previous findings in this context showed a widespread insufficiency of vitamin D at the clinical onset of T1D and a relationship between its severe deficiency with reduced fasting C peptide (FCP) and pH at clinical onset, in line with the reports of other authors [29,30,31]. This highlights the importance of vitamin D status in childhood to determine the severity of T1D at clinical onset. Ultimately, it is mandatory to correct vitamin D deficiency from the onset of T1D.  In our study, the daily supplementation of ω-3 starting from clinical onset led to, one year later, less insulin demand without affecting glycemic control, since the subjects had similar HbA1c%. Considering IDAA1c (insulin dose adjusted for HbA1c%) as a surrogate index of residual β-cell function, and IDAA1c ≤ 9 is indicative of partial remission of T1D [25], our data show that ω-3 may preserve β-cell secretion.",012b7421-7256-4171-8755-83a9fd0aa9bd
17,methods17," This finding, if confirmed by further randomized control trial (RCT)s, might be considered for assisting children beginning at the onset of the disease. The clinical outcome of a reduced insulin demand, mainly at meals, is compatible with the hypothesis of the inhibition of postprandial protein neoglucogenesis [10]. Interestingly, the effects of co-supplementation of vitamin D and ω-3 have also been reported in randomized clinical trials outside of childhood T1D, on gestational diabetes and on multiple sclerosis [32,33]. Those studies reported a reduction of blood glucose and fasting plasma insulin, and an increase of insulin sensitivity. Particularly, the trial on gestational diabetes highlighted a synergism of vitamin D and ω-3 [33]. While clinical randomized trials on co-supplementation of vitamin D and ω-3 in T1D are ongoing, our data suggest a benefit, and aim at finalizing further randomized investigations to the topic.",7702b283-a6d2-4ebd-b267-b293deeb7788
18,methods18,"  Despite the apparent benefits of reduced insulin demand in those who took ω-3 supplements, in our study, we found similar HbA1c% at comparable points from the onset of disease for both supplemented cases and controls, which represents a similar outcome to metabolic balance. This likely occurred with the addition of insulin doses in controls to keep their blood sugar within limits. Unexpectedly, we found a decreasing trend of fasting C-peptide (fasting C peptide (FCP)) from the start of ω-3 supplement (T0) to one year later (T12). A plausible explanation for similar metabolic control with less insulin administration, despite decreased fasting C peptide (FCP), is probably related to the counteraction of ω-3 on neoglucogenesis, which limits postprandial glucose increase and reduces insulin need for meals.",b8018007-0549-459a-a324-aee05afb0a07
19,methods19," The lowering of the blood glucose excursions could in turn affect the process of apoptosis of β-cells reducing glucolipotoxicity, and so could preserve residual endogen insulin secretion (REIS), according to findings in translational models [11]. This assumption might be investigated through analysis of stimulated C-peptide (stimulated C peptide (SCP)) after a standardized mixed-meal tolerance test, which allows for a direct measurement of insulin secretion, in future randomized control trial (RCT)s. A possible immune regulatory role of ω-3 supplementation could concur, together with vitamin D, to improve T1D, and should be investigated by assessing biomarkers of autoimmunity (e.g., lymphocyte subpopulations Treg or Th-17).",b3ceb964-7e88-4928-8996-34c0cc2b6538
20,methods20," This study could not determine if the decreased insulin demand is sustained only by reduced needs or also by preserved residual endogen insulin secretion (REIS) over time, because IDAA1c is a composite index of insulin needs and metabolic control, but not a direct measurement of residual endogen insulin secretion (REIS).  Another limit of this study is the failure to achieve the target levels of the AA/EPA ratio, probably due to reduced compliance of pediatric patients in the assumption of fish oil, or insufficient dosage. Reaching an AA/EPA range 1.5–3 will therefore be a goal in future trials.  The diet analysis in the ω-3 supplemented group, showed a decrease in carbohydrates, from T0 to T12, which although not significant, may have played part in the reduction of pre-prandial insulin demands. Protein and fiber moderately decreased, and no significant changes were found in terms of total lipids.",a3b35b05-263e-4f03-a427-a3a34bbba237
21,methods21," EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the diet were unmodified and not significantly increased, respectively. The reduction of AA intake was significant and relevant. It is likely that the AA reduction takes part in determining decrease of AA/EPA and outcomes. This might be related to a competition between ω-3 and ω-6 for the common metabolic pathway of LCFA and suggests that a reduction of AA nutritional intake could improve the results of omega 3 supplementation and it should undergo future research in further studies.  5. Conclusions Given that this study is a preliminary to future randomized control trial (RCT)s, our findings suggest that a ω-3 supplement, in the context of a Mediterranean diet and vitamin D administration, gives benefits to children with T1D, with a reduction of insulin requirements after 12 months of supplementation, despite a decrease in fasting C peptide (FCP).",c058233f-54e4-4239-bdf8-bb0ed7998562
22,methods22," Vitamin D and dietary intake of ω-3 and AA play a role in whether metabolic control becomes better or worse, and perhaps whether favorable or unfavorable autoimmunity follows. Particularly, further investigations should consider the direct biomarkers of insulin secretion (such as stimulated C peptide (SCP)) and of T-cell immune-regulatory subgroups (such as Tregs, Th17), to define if AA and ω-3 assign metabolic or immune effects, or both.
