0,background0,"Nuts are an important component of the so-called Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and a good source of unsaturated fatty acids, fiber, minerals (potassium, calcium and magnesium), vitamins (folate and tocopherols) and other bioactive compounds, such as phytosterols and polyphenols [1]–[4].  There is consistent evidence to suggest that the consumption of nuts has a beneficial effect on cardiovascular health, and this effect is attributable to their unique nutritional composition [5]. A pooled analysis of four large-scale observational studies showed that subjects in the highest nut consumption categories had an approximately 35% reduced risk of incident coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) [6]. The frequency of nut consumption was also related to lower rates of sudden cardiac death in a large cohort of men [7].",96471789-3be5-4c08-8270-4aa749832fc5
1,background1," Furthermore, epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have shown that frequent nut consumption is associated with a reduced load of cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome [4,6,8,9]. In addition, reports from the Iowa Women’s Health study [10], a large Dutch cohort [11], and the US Nurses’ Health Study [12], which assessed populations with relatively low overall nut intake, suggested that frequent nut consumption related inversely to total mortality, albeit the protective effect was weak, with adjusted risk reductions ranging from 5% to 15% [10]–[12]. If an inverse association between nut consumption and all-cause mortality exists, the beneficial effect might be more robust in Mediterranean regions, where nut consumption per person is relatively high compared to other countries [13].",74eaf780-44ed-4e31-912b-55667381012f
2,background2,"  The main aim of the PREDIMED study was to test the efficacy of two Mediterranean diets (one supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and another with nuts), as compared to a control diet (advice on a low-fat diet), on primary cardiovascular prevention. In contrast, in this current manuscript our aims were only to assess the association between baseline consumption of nuts (that is, the consumption of nuts previous to starting the intervention) and total mortality (instead of cardiovascular events). We have additionally included the repeated measurements for the consumption of nuts during follow-up as another exposure, regardless of the allocated arm of the trial; this is in contrast with the original PREDIMED study, which used an intention-to-treat analysis.  We hypothesized that level of nut consumption would be strongly associated with mortality in the cohort of the PREDIMED (‘PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea’) study, including older men and women at high cardiovascular risk [14].",629cd7ea-0850-4a1e-9d43-316a75719568

4,methods0,"Study population The present study was conducted within the framework of the PREDIMED trial, the design of which has been described in detail elsewhere [14]. Briefly, the PREDIMED study is a large, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized and controlled clinical trial for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) (http://www.predimed.es and http://www.predimed.org). The main results of the trial on the primary endpoint have been recently published [15]. We assigned 7,447 older participants (men aged 55 to 80 years and women 60 to 80 years) to 1 of 3 interventions: a MedDiet enriched with extra-virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)), a MedDiet supplemented with mixed nuts, or advice on a low-fat diet (control diet).",db2d28b8-9eb7-4637-9d08-2bb71e4eb4cd
5,methods1," Participants had no cardiovascular disease (CVD) at enrollment but they were at high cardiovascular risk because of the presence of type 2 diabetes or at least three of the following risk factors: current smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, low high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL))-cholesterol, overweight or obesity, and family history of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Exclusion criteria were the presence of severe medical condition that may impair the ability of the person to participate in a nutrition intervention study (for example, digestive disease with fat intolerance, advanced malignancy, or major neurological, psychiatric or endocrine disease), immunodeficiency or HIV positive status, alcohol or drug abuse, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) ≥40 kg/m2, and allergy or intolerance to olive oil or nuts [16].",d9010e3f-7287-40df-b1ca-10c226c741e7
6,methods2,"  The primary endpoint of the main trial is a combination of several cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death). The present study was conducted as an observational cohort using baseline consumption of nuts as the exposure. The outcomes were: (1) total mortality, (2) only cardiovascular mortality, and (3) only cancer mortality.

Dietary assessment At baseline trained dietitians completed a 137-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire in a face-to-face interview with the participant; this questionnaire has been validated before in an older population at high cardiovascular risk from Spain [17]. Energy and nutrient intake were estimated using Spanish food composition tables [18,19]. Information on self-reported nut intake was derived from the food frequency questionnaire.",ce9fc19f-89b6-4a39-9e94-46531dacaf4c
8,methods4," The questionnaire includes one item regarding the consumption of almonds, peanuts, hazelnuts, pistachios and pine nuts (macadamias, cashews and Brazil nuts are rarely consumed in Spain), and another question specifically inquired about the consumption of walnuts. The dietitians asked the participants if they consumed this food item never, between 1 to 3 times per month, times per week (1, 2 to 4, 5 to 6; three options) or times a day (1, 2 to 3, 4 to 6, >6; four options). For the purpose of the present study, 28 g of nuts was considered to be one serving. Peanuts, almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, pine nuts, pistachios, Brazil nuts, macadamia and cashews were all considered nuts. In addition, dietitians administered a validated 14-item MedDiet screener designed to assess the degree of adherence to the traditional MedDiet [20].",50e5e77d-9985-453b-bcbe-546f660d0669
9,methods5," We used the score of this brief screener to control for the overall dietary pattern, because a higher adherence to the MedDiet among frequent consumers of nuts could introduce confounding. For this purpose, the question about nut consumption was omitted from the brief screener; therefore, a 13-point score was used as a covariate (minimum 0, maximum 13).  Ascertainment of mortality Information on mortality was updated once a year by the End-point Adjudication Committee, whose members were blinded to treatment allocation. Different sources of information were used: (1) yearly questionnaires and examinations to all participants, (2) family physicians, (3) yearly review of medical records, and (4) linkage to the National Death Index. Medical records of deceased participants were requested, and the End-point Adjudication Committee adjudicated the cause of the death.",2a05491f-e20e-4798-8b92-89d6daf07b0c
10,methods6,"  Assessment of other covariates At baseline, questionnaires about lifestyle variables, educational achievement, history of illnesses, and medication use were administered. Physical activity was assessed using the validated Spanish version of the Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity questionnaire [21]. Participants were considered to be diabetic, hypercholesterolemic or hypertensive if they had previously been diagnosed as such, and/or they were being treated with antidiabetic, cholesterol-lowering, or antihypertensive agents, respectively. Trained personnel took the anthropometric and blood pressure measurements.",5e692dc6-810b-4db7-8468-da8266237c14
11,methods7," Weight and height were measured with light clothing and no shoes with calibrated scales and a wall-mounted stadiometer, respectively; waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest using an anthropometric tape; blood pressure was measured using a validated oscillometer (Omron HEM705CP; Hoofddorp, The Netherlands) in triplicate with a 5-minute interval between each measurement, and the mean of these values was recorded.  Statistical analyses Follow-up time was calculated as the difference between the date of either death or end of follow-up (the date of the last visit or the last recorded clinical event of participants still alive) and the date of recruitment. Extremes of total energy intake (>4,000 or <800 kcal per day in men and >3,500 or <500 kcal per day in women) were excluded from the analysis [22]. Three categories of frequency of nut consumption were considered (never or almost never, 1 to 3 servings per week and >3 servings per week).",9a0fc671-624d-4042-8ce7-8def604b6f94
12,methods8," We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Pearson χ2 tests to compare the quantitative or categorical baseline characteristics of the study participants, respectively, across servings of nut consumption. Results were expressed as means ± SD or percentages. Because no interaction was observed between sex and the main outcome, analyses were conducted for men and women together.  To assess the risk of total mortality by frequency of nut consumption, multivariate relative risks were computed using Cox proportional hazard models, and potential confounders were controlled for. All analyses were stratified by the recruitment center. Results are expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Given the different nutritional composition of walnuts and other nuts [1], we performed separate analyses for the frequency of total nut consumption, walnut consumption, and consumption of nuts excluding walnuts.",0818aae3-b228-4450-8d01-2b7541e124ad

We evaluated the interaction between baseline nut consumption (three categories, two dummy variables) and the intervention group (three groups, two dummy variables) by introducing an interaction term with four degrees of freedom in the model. We used Cox regression models to assess the risk of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality according to the joint categories of total nut consumption and intervention group. Linear trends were also tested.

28,discussion2,"  Our findings concur with those of epidemiological studies showing inverse associations between nut consumption and cardiovascular mortality. Four large prospective studies have reported consistent inverse associations between nut consumption and fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or sudden cardiac death [23]–[26]. In the Adventist Health Study, subjects who consumed nuts >5 times per week had a 48% reduced risk of fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) [23]. The reduction in death from coronary heart disease (CHD) among women who consumed nuts 2 to 4 times/week in the Iowa Women’s Health Study were 57% [24]. However, a later report from the same study with longer follow-up failed to confirm that nut consumption protected from coronary heart disease (CHD) death [10]. In addition, the Nurses’ Health Study observed that women who consumed nuts ≥5 times/week had a 30% reduced risk of fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) [25].",7333c404-282e-464e-ab9c-906bc55b0e1a
29,discussion3," Finally, the Physicians’ Health Study reported a 47% lower risk of sudden cardiac death and 30% lower risk of total coronary heart disease (CHD) death among men who consumed nuts twice a week or more [7].  In our study, a reduced risk of cancer mortality has been observed in individuals that frequently consumed total nuts and walnuts. Few epidemiologic studies have been conducted evaluating the association between nut consumption and cancer. An ecological study showed that prostate cancer mortality was inversely associated with nuts and oilseed consumption [27]. Moreover, findings from prospective studies suggest inverse associations between nut consumption and colorectal or endometrial cancer, especially in women [28]–[31]. Some studies showed inverse associations of nut intake and prostate cancer [32], however the relationship between nuts and cancer incidence and mortality is insufficient and further research is needed [33].",4ecd202d-3b4c-4824-8a8a-f22ca4b9f13d
30,discussion4," A possible explanation that may account for the inverse relationship between walnuts and cancer mortality but not with other nuts could be that walnuts were richer in free and total polyphenols than all the other nuts [34]. As walnuts are usually consumed raw, and roasting can cause a decline in the efficacy in the antioxidant capacity, it has been shown that raw walnuts, as consumed in the PREDIMED study, had the highest antioxidant efficacy among all the nuts [34]; this could play a beneficial role in the prevention of cancer.  The present results also support those of prior observational studies suggesting that nut consumption protects against mortality. In the Iowa Women’s Health Study, subjects consuming nuts ≥2 times/week had a significant 12% lower mortality risk than those who ate nuts less than once monthly after a 12-year follow-up [10].",13f63715-5117-4929-bd5e-0bf2b47879c3
31,discussion5," A recent study from a large Dutch cohort followed for 10 years reported that men and women in the 75th percentile of nut intake had 8% and 5% lower risks of all-cause mortality, respectively, compared with subjects in the 25th percentile [11]. Additionally, data from the Nurses’ Health Study, where participants were followed-up for nearly 18 years, showed that consuming nuts ≥2 times/week was associated with a 14% reduced risk of all-cause mortality [12]. It is noteworthy that the protection against total mortality afforded by nut consumption in our study was ≥3 orders of magnitude higher than that observed in studies of non-Mediterranean populations. A likely reason is that PREDIMED participants had a rather high self-selected nut intake before entering the study. Thus, 32% of PREDIMED participants consumed nuts >3 times/week, compared with nearly 10% consuming nuts ≥2 times/week in both the Iowa Women’s Health Study [10] and the Nurses’ Health Study [12].",ae6b133d-1961-4833-bf07-b8cd338b2849
32,discussion6," In the Dutch study, participants in the 75th percentile of nut consumption had rather low average daily intakes of 11.1 g for men and 6.2 g for women [11].  The healthy nutritional profile of nuts may account for the inverse association observed between nuts and mortality. Nuts are high in monounsaturated fatty acids, fiber, minerals, vitamins and many bioactive compounds; all these nutrients may partly explain the beneficial effects on health that nuts have been shown to exert [3,4]. The frequency of nut consumption has been inversely related to several chronic prevalent conditions, such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cancer, and coronary heart disease (CHD), among others [5,26].",165545d2-7e5d-421e-a2cd-6a7b8343f0d2
33,discussion7," These inverse associations can be influenced by various mechanisms: nuts improve the blood lipid profile [6] and appear to decrease insulin resistance [8], and there is also evidence suggesting that they can modulate inflammation [35], oxidative stress [36], and endothelial function [37]. As a large body of evidence supports the beneficial effects of frequent nut consumption on many health outcomes, it is plausible that nuts protect as well against all-cause mortality.  Our study has limitations. First, given its observational nature, it is not possible to firmly conclude that the inverse relationship between nut consumption and total mortality reflects cause and effect. Second, even though data were adjusted for all possible confounders, there is still the possibility of residual confounding.",9759bf19-0469-4f75-810f-06b9766cf4af
34,discussion8," However, the enhanced protective effect against all-cause mortality observed in frequent nut consumers at baseline who continued eating nuts during follow-up because they were allocated to the nuts intervention arm supports a causal relationship between increasing dietary exposure to nuts and reduced mortality. However, as the study was conducted in an older Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk, the results cannot easily be extrapolated to the general population. Nevertheless, it is relevant to assess these associations in individuals at high cardiovascular risk because this population is the most frequently attended by primary care physicians and the segment of population that can obtain higher benefits with diet or lifestyle changes.  There are also strengths to our study, such as a large sample size, relatively long duration of follow-up, and objective and thorough ascertainment of mortality as outcome in this prospective observational assessment.",3063c3e9-b900-4512-af6b-4f8b781680b3
35,discussion9,"  Conclusions In summary, this study provides further evidence of the inverse relationship between the frequency of nut consumption and the risk of mortality in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk with relatively high nut intake.
