0,introduction0,"Population ageing is accelerating worldwide, mainly due to the increase in life expectancy, but also the decrease in birth rates [1]. Although this can be seen as a successful result of the improvements in health care as well as in public health policies, it also creates new challenges to society and health systems, since it increases the rates of age-related degenerative conditions. The progressive decline in cognitive function in the elderly is a major manifestation of the ageing progress. When accompanied by loss of independence it affects the quality of life of the individual but also has various societal and economic costs. Furthermore, dementia has emerged as a major non-communicable disease in the elderly. In 2015, dementia affected more that 47 million people worldwide and the number is expected to triple by 2050 [2]. Beyond the direct cost of dementia itself, a two and a half fold increase in overall mortality risk has been estimated for people with dementia [3].",93fd3b89-2b12-456c-a9fa-7b2e61107475
1,introduction1," It should be noted, however, that studies that have compared cohorts in the same population have found that later born populations have lower risk of prevalent dementia, providing some indication that prevalence may be declining [4–7].  The identification of factors that may slow down the decline in cognitive function or even prevent dementia is crucial in terms of public health policy. Nutrition is a modifiable factor that has been consistently associated with cognition at various levels, including intake of specific nutrients or food ingredients [8], consumption of specific foods [9] or specific dietary patterns [10]. Due to the complex biological interactions between different components of a diet, it has been proposed that the use of a whole-diet approach and the study of specific dietary patterns may provide advantages in understanding the role of diet in chronic diseases, including cognitive impairment in the elderly [11].",300e6435-f7f8-4a74-9ce5-7ee8a25e5dcf
2,introduction2,"  The MeDi pattern has been associated with a protective effect for many chronic diseases. In the area of brain health, despite some negative studies [12–19], a positive relationship between MeDi adherence and reduced risk for cognitive decline or dementia has been demonstrated by most cross-sectional and prospective epidemiological studies [20–28] and some meta-analyses [29–31]. Additionally, two clinical trials (both part of PREDIMED) with an extended period of follow up support the association between MeDi and cognitive performance [32, 33], while a short duration intervention (i.e. 6 months) in a relatively small number of subjects failed to find an association [34].  One of the methodological issues in the current literature includes the evaluation of adherence to the MeDi, which may limit the generalizability of the results [35].",f8174476-a7ac-4861-ae69-57b4d0191b1e
3,introduction3," Specifically, some of the scores that have been used so far are population-specific and cannot be directly compared with scores computed in different samples. The use of specific cut-off points in the context of a score addresses this limitation, measuring adherence to a pre-defined Mediterranean dietary pattern [35]. Additionally, associations between individual components of the MeDi (i.e., specific food groups, macronutrients) and cognitive function have not been adequately explored.  Regarding the influence of diet patterns on cognition, many of the previous studies have focused on dementia as the major clinical outcome, and, to a lesser extent, on detailed cognitive functioning.",49fe36fd-c8e5-42c1-8a65-a6a36c47621d
4,introduction4," Furthermore, some of the previous studies have either evaluated cognitive function with a relatively limited cognitive assessment battery (instead of an extensive neuropsychological evaluation) [14, 16, 17, 19], that does not allow a comprehensive assessment of cognitive functioning which may alter our ability to detect subtle associations between nutrition and cognition and to explore relations with particular cognitive domains. Additionally many of them have not explored in detail the relationship between the MeDi and particular cognitive domains. Also, analyses in some of the previous studies were not fully adjusted for all necessary potential confounding variables. Finally, associations between diet, particularly adherence to the MeDi pattern, and cognitive performance have received limited attention in Mediterranean populations.",ed203f30-6b9e-44a8-bb81-e971785ffb8d
5,introduction5," The only relevant study conducted in a Greek population was the EPIC-Greece cohort that assessed cognitive function only through the Mini Mental State Examination Test [14].  Our aim in undertaking the present study was to explore comprehensively the relationship between the MeDi pattern and its components, and specific domains of cognitive functioning in a representative Greek population of elderly adults, a population with a life-long Mediterranean overall lifestyle. Adherence to MeDi was defined by an a priori,non population-specific index, and cognitive function was assessed by a comprehensive clinical neuropsychological evaluation of each participant, rather than a limited cognitive screening assessment.

Changes in performance of daily activities and self-care habits that require physical capacity and cognitive functioning, in particular memory, comprehension, calculations and visuospatial orientation, were measured using the Blessed Dementia Scale [37]. The participants’ ability to use the telephone and transportation, medication management and handling of finances independently was assessed using the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL)) [38].

Medical records, when available, were also reviewed to classify stoke subtypes according to the TOAST criteria [48]. In addition, participants reporting memory deterioration were also asked if they had a sudden loss of cognitive function around the time they had a stroke and if they noticed a fluctuating or stepwise progression of their symptoms.",df37dc06-c6cb-47a7-9c11-680ed75100f1
12,methods6," Based on information both from the medical history and the neurological examination, we calculated the Hachinski Ischemia Scale score, which is a useful screening tool for vascular dementia [49, 50]. To identify clinical features characteristic of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)) we used the Semi-quantified Clinical Fluctuating Cognition Rating Scale, which evaluates fluctuations in the level of consciousness and/or cognition [51]. In addition, a structured questionnaire was designed to determine presence of core (fluctuation of alertness/cognition, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism), suggestive (REM sleep behavior disorder, severe neuroleptic sensitivity) or supportive features (repeated falls and syncope, transient alteration of consciousness, severe autonomic dysfunction, hallucinations in other modalities, systematised delusions, depression) of the revised Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) diagnostic criteria [52].",cd1fc142-79a6-4dcb-9286-e135b9559ac5

16,methods10," Decision on grouping of neuropsychological tests was based on a priori neuropsychological knowledge of particular cognitive functions that each test reflects. Furthermore, domain z-scores were averaged in order to calculate a composite z-score.  Diagnoses Diagnoses were reached through diagnostic consensus meetings of all the researchers and main investigators, both neurologists and neuropsychologists, involved in the project. In particular, the diagnosis of dementia and its subtypes was based on DSM-IV-TR criteria [64] and the designation of probable or possible AD was made according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria [65]. The diagnosis of vascular dementia was based on a history or clinical evidence of stroke, the presence of a clear temporal relation between stroke and the onset of dementia and the Hachinski Ischemia Scale score [49].",832d84ef-a550-4dcd-8257-0b72d8c87d0f
17,methods11," Lewy body and frontotemporal dementias were diagnosed based respective criteria [66, 67]. Quantification of the staging of dementia was performed by means of a semi-structured interview of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)), which globally assesses six domains of cognitive and functional performance [68].  Dietary assessment Dietary intake was evaluated with a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire that has been validated for the Greek population [69]. The questionnaire was completed by each participant with the aid of an experienced investigator and when necessary with the aid of the caregiver. Responses were converted to daily intakes of specific food items and were extrapolated into macronutrient intakes. Energy intake was calculated by summing energy intake from macronutrients and alcohol, assuming 4 kcal/g for carbohydrates and proteins, 9 kcal/g for lipids and 7 kcal/g for alcohol.",49a97dbb-82e4-438b-b24c-49a59c860c7d
18,methods12," Dietary intake was also grouped into food groups featuring the core foods of the Greek diet [70]. Adherence to the MeDi pattern was evaluated through the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MedDietScore), proposed by Panagiotakos et al.[71]. The scoring is based on the weekly consumption of eleven food groups and an individual score for each component is calculated, ranging from 0–5. For the consumption of items that are presumed to closely characterize the Mediterranean pattern (i.e. non-refined cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, potatoes, fish and olive oil), individuals who reported no consumption were assigned a score of 0, and scores of 1–5 are assigned for rare to daily consumption. For the consumption of foods that are presumed to diverge from this diet pattern (i.e. meat and meat products, poultry and full-fat dairy products), participants were assigned scores on a reverse scale (i.e. from 5 when they reported no consumption to 0 when they reported almost daily consumption).",c1eec690-fb18-4aa7-987a-b941fe78182a
19,methods13," For alcohol intake, a score of 5 was assigned for consumption of less than 300 ml of alcohol/d, a score of 0 was assigned for no consumption or for consumption of 700 ml/d and scores of 4–1 were assigned for consumption of 600–700, 500–600, 400–500 and 300–400 mL/d (100 mL have 12 g of ethanol concentration), respectively. The total score ranged from 0 to 55, with higher values indicating greater adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern. This score aims to address one of the limitations of the Mediterranean scores, as the frequency of consumption of each food group part of the score is used as cut-off with respect to the traditional MeDi pattern (i.e. frequency of consumption is compared to predefined scores assumed to be close or away from the MeDi pattern and not to the consumption of the specific population) [35]. In the analyses of the present paper, the MedDietScore was used either as a continuous variable, or as quartiles, where the first quartile (i.e.",0e1930da-9c6e-4920-bf49-ef62b65ca038
20,methods14," lowest adherence to the Mediterranean Diet) served as the reference group and was compared to the other quartiles, i.e. Q2, Q3 and Q4, with the last one indicating the greatest adherence to the Mediterranean Diet.  Other assessments Height and weight were measured on a levelled platform scale and a wall-mounted stadiometer, to the nearest 0.5 kg and 0.5 cm, respectively. Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) was calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the height in meters squared. The presence of clinical co-morbidities was recorded, as part of the medical history, through the use of a questionnaire containing 23 clinical conditions. Education was expressed as total years of education. ApoE genotyping, available for 1,247 participants was performed in genomic DNA extracted from blood buffy coat, using Qiamp DNA Blood Midi Kits (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands)[72].

30,discussion0,"The MeDi dietary pattern has been associated with various health benefits and decreased risk of many diseases. In this observational analysis of 1,864 elderly individuals from a Mediterranean region (Greece) we found that adherence to this pattern was positively associated with a decreased likelihood of dementia and better cognitive performance in many domains, especially memory. Furthermore, individual components of the MeDi, specifically fish and whole cereals, were associated with better cognitive performance.  Some studies have failed to establish an association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cognition. The absence of association in these studies could be attributed to lack of statistical power, i.e. few new cases of diagnosed cognitive impairment at follow-up [12], specific characteristics of the population examined, e.g.",c6117ff8-154e-4d7d-aaef-4b24e2d73570
31,discussion1," individuals with, or at risk of, cardiovascular disease [17] or limitations in the assessment of adherence to the Mediterranean diet by the use of a posteriori scores [12, 14, 16, 17]. At the same time, several cohort studies, as well as meta-analyses, have revealed a protective effect of the MeDi against cognitive decline in the elderly [20–26, 29–31]. Our results are in line with these studies, and, in fact, extend current knowledge by establishing a positive association between adherence to the MeDi pattern and domain-specific cognitive performance, even in individuals without dementia. Up to date, the few clinical trials in the area have reported inconsistent results. Two studies in the Spanish population have provided results in favor of an association between MeDi and cognitive function [32, 33], while a 6-month intervention in the Australian population failed to establish an association [34].",e4daf532-bfd4-4fcd-819b-5ee391441b7f
32,discussion2," Possible explanations for the lack of an association in this study could be the short duration of the intervention, the relatively limited number of participants, or the way MeDi was defined (i.e. based on the Australian food and nutrient profile, rather than a more traditional MeDi definition) resulting in smaller nutritional intervention differences between the experimental and the control groups.  The mechanisms by which adherence to the MeDi could exert a protective effect are not fully understood. It has been proposed that the beneficial effects on cognitive function could be mediated through positive effects on cardiovascular risk factors [73, 74]. Furthermore cerebrovascular mechanisms may be involved. A recent study has found that MeDi was associated with reduced brain infarcts [75] and a lower white matter hyperintensity volume [76] in elderly individuals.",c8da125b-e84d-4dcb-8669-9dd2bdab5469
33,discussion3," Another way by which the MeDi may confer its favorable effects in cognitive function is through its anti-oxidant capacity [77] and anti-inflammatory properties [78]. Inflammation has been associated with compromised vascular health, as well as neuronal damage in the brain, through amyloid peptides accumulation and subsequent activation of microglia and reactive astrocytes [79]. In favor of this potential protective mechanism of MeDi, non-refined cereals consumption, a food group with high antioxidant potential, was independently associated with cognitive performance.  Alzheimer’s disease is a neurological condition where neuro-degeneration and hippocampal atrophy is most prominent, even in early phases of the disease’s development [80]. Diet quality has been shown to be related to the volume of the hippocampus (the brain structure that is mainly associated with learning and memory) [81].",6fdd3e90-8c06-4753-a492-fa4f83777b78
34,discussion4," In elderly humans, MeDi has been associated with reduced brain atrophy [82] and reduced amyloid peptides load in the brain [83]. In our study, the relative risk for all dementias was identical with the relative risk for Alzheimer’s disease related dementia, while memory was the only cognitive domain consistently associated with MedDietScore, in fully adjusted models and in all cognitive status groups. Taken together, these observations and our results may indicate that the protective effect of MeDi may be mediated by beneficial effects on neuro-degeneration.  Interactions of diet and health and the effect of diet on disease development are complex and difficult to establish. We consistently observed a positive association between adherence to the MeDi pattern and cognitive function, however the associations of individual components of this pattern with cognitive function were less strong and most of them were attenuated in fully adjusted models.",1605e645-42a8-421f-a920-5280a7e9e2de
35,discussion5," As also noted in other studies [26], it appears that interactions of the components of the MeDi pattern or their additive effect, and thus the overall pattern, may be more important for health enhancement than individual food groups alone.  Regarding individual components of the MedDietScore employed in this study, fish consumption was the only predictor of dementia. A substantial body of evidence exists, supporting an association between fish consumption and dementia [84]. Additionally, non-refined cereals were the only food group that was a significantly associated with cognitive performance. This finding has also been reported in a large prospective study of elderly women, wherein greater whole grain intake was not associated with cognitive trajectories, but was related to higher average global cognition scores [85]. This association may be mediated through the antioxidant potential of the specific food group or its other properties, e.g.",3ac4ea83-2e1d-4d16-ac22-6f93410b2632
36,discussion6," factors that coincide with increased fiber consumption. Alternatively, increased consumption of non-refined (versus refined) cereals may be an indicator of an increased effort to adhere to a prudent diet.  Our study has several limitations. This is a cross-sectional analysis that cannot provide causal relationships, only state hypotheses for future explorations. Thus, reverse causality cannot be excluded. Another limitation is the precision in the assessment of dietary intake by a food frequency questionnaire and the possibility that individuals with cognitive impairment may misreport their food consumption. Precise and easily applicable methods for the dietary assessment of such large populations, however, are scarce. Additionally, we took every precaution to limit food consumption misreporting. Specifically, trained dietitians administered the questionnaires and when precise information could not be obtained, the caregiver of the individual assisted in the data collection.",b04fe08a-ed89-4e23-92e5-05d41a7ea578
37,discussion7," We also performed all sensitivity analyses possible in order to exclude misreporting (i.e. excluding not only individuals without dementia, but even those with mild cognitive impairment). Although we took under consideration many confounders, the influence of other confounders not assessed in this study (i.e. residual confounding) cannot be entirely excluded.  At the same time, our study has many strengths. We administered a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation that included both a full neuropsychological battery and a diagnosis of cognitive impairment based on consensus of the investigators’ team, with use of standard criteria. A major advantage of the study is the scoring system used for estimating adherence to Medi. We used a score that is based on weighting of the selected food groups based on the frequency of consumption (thresholds were chosen according to an a priori hypothesis) and regardless of the consumption by the sample studied [35].",950cffeb-17a8-4a7b-9c86-65dd4d544cd4
38,discussion8,"Dietary data were also collected with an instrument validated in the population studied. Furthermore, our sample is population representative and includes individuals from both a rural and an urban area. In addition, we adjusted for many potential confounders and we performed all necessary sensitivity analyses.  In conclusion, our data suggest a positive association between adherence to the MeDipattern and dementia absence, as well as specific domains of cognitive performance, especially memory, in a traditional Mediterranean population. It seems that the total dietary pattern, rather than individual components, confers the most beneficial effects. This may be of clinical relevance in the setting of population-based prevention efforts as well as in clinical practice.",8c90e6ab-4f27-4753-b098-ca4f8f5e3e53
39,discussion9," The completion of follow-up evaluations in Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Ageing and Diet (HELIAD), studies with more robust design, and especially clinical trials, should confirm these associations and elucidate the mechanisms by which MeDi or its components exert their potential health enhancing effects on the nervous system. =",ea2e5093-3aa1-4a67-941b-19ad8856f982
