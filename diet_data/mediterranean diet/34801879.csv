0,methods0," 4.1. Cheese Samples and Experimental Design  The present work explored the microbial community associated with a typical raw goat milk cheese. Caprino Nicastrese cheese was employed as the study object, as an example of a traditional raw goat milk cheese. Following collection, the raw goat milk was coagulated for 60 min at 36 °C using 0.4 g/L goat rennet and without the addition of any starter culture. The resulting curd was manually cut into rice-sized pieces, shaped, and stored at room temperature for 48 h to drain out the residual whey. Cheese wheels were then salted for 24 h in brine with 30% (w/v) NaCl. Finally, the cheese was ripened in wooden axis in the storage basement of the cheese farms at 10–15 °C and 70–85% humidity.  Samples from the surface and inner mass (i.e., rind and core, respectively) of the cheese wheels were aseptically collected with a sterile knife from 30-, 60-, and 90-day-ripened cheese wheels.",a0843d8c-35d6-4f21-973c-8697c111d651
1,methods1," Biological replicates were sampled as defined in Figure 7 and transported on ice to the laboratory for the subsequent isolation and analysis of the harbored microbiota.  Bacterial fractions were isolated from the rind and core of the cheese wheel at 30, 60, and 90 days of ripening. Pooling was performed, with each pool including bacterial extracts from three samples. Eighteen pools were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 9 from the rind and 9 from the core. Each depth was composed of 3 sample pools taken from cheese wheels ripened for 30, 60, and 90 days. The metaproteomics survey relied on a total of 10 sample pools, 4 for the rind and 6 for the core depth. Two pools were considered from each ripening timepoint of the core depth, whereas two pools were excluded in the rind groups due to technical issues encountered during the analytical workflow. Specifically, one pool was omitted from the pool at 60 days and one from the group at 90 days of ripening.  4.2.",6a691172-710a-46f8-bc4f-b96100216477
2,methods2," Bacterial Fraction Enrichment  To avoid alterations to the microbiota composition and/or activity, all the steps of the bacterial fraction enrichment were performed at 4 °C, with the temperature kept under strict control. Briefly, independent aliquots of 0.5 g of each biological replicate per sample type were finely grated and homogenized with 15 mL buffer containing 50 mM Na2HPO4 and 0.1% Tween 80 at pH 8.0. Samples were then shaken on an orbital shaker at 1600 rpm for 10 min. Following this, the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 2500× g. The supernatant was collected in a new tube and subjected to four more rounds of shaking/centrifuge/resuspension, whereas the pellet from each step was gently resuspended and collected in a single clean “pool vial”. The “pool vial” was finally centrifuged at 12,000× g for 20 min, resulting in the collection of a bacterial pellet from an original amount of 0.5g cheese aliquots [1,14,35].",bdb7fa79-7be7-47d1-8f56-d6f5fabbcb12
3,methods3,"  The enriched bacterial fractions represented the common starting point for the two analytical approaches employed in the present study: 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metaproteomics (Figure 7).  4.3. 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing and Metataxonomic Analysis  DNA Extraction and Library Preparation  Cheese DNA was extracted from 9 rind and 9 core samples, respectively, 3 for each ripening time point (Figure. 7) according to the EZ1 DNA Tissue protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Starting from 40 mg, 190 µL of buffer G2 and 10 µL of proteinase K solution were added to each sample aliquot, before incubation at 56 °C in an Eppendorf® Thermomixer until complete sample lysis, with vortexing 2–3 times per hour to disperse the sample. Two hundred microliters of supernatant were transferred to a new 2 mL sample tube, and the automated EZ1 extraction was finalized.",60678d0e-76e2-4378-8fc3-d1789809eba7
4,methods4," The amplification of the V3–V4 variable region from the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (∼460 bp) was carried out using the primers 16S_F 5′-(TCG TCG GCA GCG trichloroacetic acid (TCA) GAT GTG TAT AAG AGA CAG CCT ACG GGN GGC WGC AG)-3′ and 16S_R 5′-(GTC TCG TGG GCT CGG AGA TGT GTA TAA GAG ACA GGA CTA CHV GGG TAT CTA ATC C)-3′, according to the MiSeq rRNA Amplicon Sequencing protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The PCR reactions were set up using 2 × KAPA Hifi HotStart ready Mix kits (KAPA Biosystems Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA). DNA amplicons were cleaned up using CleanNGS kit beads (CleanNA, Waddinxveen, The Netherlands). A second amplification step was performed to obtain a unique combination of Illumina Nextera XT dual indices for each sample. The final libraries were cleaned up using CleanNGS kit beads; quantified by a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA); and normalized to 4 nM.",a65c359e-6532-46f7-8093-0a2d9a36390c
5,methods5," To generate 250 × paired-end 2 bp length reads, normalized libraries were pooled together and run on the Illumina MiSeq platform, according to manufacturer’s specifications.  4.4. Biocomputational and Statistical Analysis for Cheese Microbiota Profile Analysis  QIIME2 was used to analyze the paired-end sequencing reads [36]. Quality control, denoising, chimera removal, trimming, and the construction of the amplicon sequence variant (amplicon sequence variant (ASV)) table were performed by the means of DADA2, implemented as a plugin in QIIME2 [37]. The taxonomy was assigned using a Naive Bayes model pre-trained on SILVA through the QIIME2 plugin q2-feature classifiers [38].

Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots were used to illustrate the beta diversity of samples. The amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table was normalized using the cumulative sum scaling (cumulative sum scaling (CSS)) method [40]; hence, the Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to compare taxonomic differences at the phylum (L2), family (L5), and genus (L6) levels. Python 3.7 was used to perform ecological statistical analyses. Three different levels of statistical significance were identified based on different p values (p ≤  0.001) and false-discovery rate (false discovery rate (FDR)) thresholds (p ≤  0.05, p ≤ 0.",c6a1b9e8-c8c8-4237-9897-120cc531b470

Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) [42], employing the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)) orthologs (KO) database, was used to determine amplicon sequence variant (ASV)s and their microbiome functions. In addition, LEfSe (linear discriminant analysis effect size) was independently used to determine the features most likely to explain the differences between the rind and core of the cheese wheel at 30, 60, and 90 days of ripening.  4.5. Metaproteome Extraction and Quantification  Bacterial pellets obtained via the above-described bacterial fraction enrichment protocol were resuspended in protein extraction buffer (7M UREA, 2M Thiourea, 4% CHAPS) and subjected to 6 cycles of 1 min bead beating (Minilys, Bertin Tecnologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France), interspersed with 1 min resting on ice.",b2c746fa-d19c-4f74-b3d7-b131c4063d3e
8,methods8," Bead-beating steps were performed by shaking each sample at 4000 rpm with an equal amount (1:1 v/w) of 0.1 mm zirconium silica beads. Following bead beating, the samples were heated up to 60 °C for 10 min and centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000× g and 4 °C. The supernatant containing the extracted metaproteome was collected in a clean tube and further processed for the metaproteomic analytical workflow.  Extracted proteins were quantified using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 50 μg of the extracted proteins was precipitated by incubation (30 min at 4 °C) with precooled 20% trichloroacetic acid (trichloroacetic acid (TCA)) and kept for further processing.  4.6. Trypsin Digestion and Mass Spectrometry Analysis  Precipitated proteins were digested in solution.",9bc929c4-6d62-4380-a530-fc3acc0cf94b
9,methods9," Briefly, 50 μg of total proteins for each sample was treated for disulfide bond reduction with 10 mM DTT for 1 h at +37 °C and alkylated with 20 mM IAA at +37 °C for 1 h in the dark. Iodoacetamide excess was removed by the incubation of the sample with 1.61 mM DTT at +37 °C for 20 min. Sample digestion was carried out overnight at +37° C using trypsin in a 1: 50 (w/w) ratio with respect to the protein content. Enzymatic digestion was stopped by the addition of 0.1% FA (v/v). Tryptic peptides were purified and desalted using self-assembled C18 Stage Tips [43]. Tips containing the C18 membranes with the bounded peptide mixture were eluted with 5% acetonitrile (5% ACN/0.1% TFA), dried in the vacuum centrifuge, and stored at −20 °C until mass spectrometry measurements.  Prior to MS/MS measurement, the dried peptide mixture was suspended in 0.1% FA and loaded onto a precolumn Acclaim PepMap100 C18 (5 μm, 100 Å, 300 μm i.d. × 5 mm) (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA).",ddc06ed7-dfbd-40e5-afc9-b25e8448fd65
10,methods10," Following 5 min of trapping, operating at 10 μL/min in eluent A, peptides were separated by an Easy-Spray PepMap C18 column (2 µm 100 Å 15 cm × 50 µm ID) with a Thermo Scientific Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano system (Sunnyvale, CA, USA).  Analyses were performed using an aqueous solution of FA (0.1%, v/v) as eluent A and ACN/FA (99.9:0.1, v/v) as eluent B in the following gradient elution: (i) 5% of eluent B (7 min); (ii) from 5 to 35% of eluent B (113 min); (iii) from 35 to 99% of B (15 min); (iv) 99% of B (10 min); (v) from 99 to 5% of B (2 min); (vi) 5% of B for column conditioning (13 min). The column was kept at 35 °C and operated at a flow rate of 300 nL/min; the injection volume was set at 5.0 μL.  Peptides were directly eluted into Orbitrap Elite nanoESI-MS/MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Tandem mass spectrometry measurements were performed in positive full-scan acquisition mode in the 350–2000 m/z range and with a resolution power of 60,000.",e3ca858a-6b55-4462-8698-8003f3e3e3e2
11,methods11," The nanoESI tuning parameters were as follows: capillary temperature 250 °C, source voltage 1.5 kV, sheath gas 0, auxiliary gas 0, and S-lens RR level 50%. MS/MS analyses were performed in data-dependent scan (data dependent scan (DDS)) mode by selecting and fragmenting the twenty most intense multiple-charged ions of the collected full-scan spectra using collision-induced dissociation (CID, 35% normalized collision energy) with a resolution power of 60,000. Only precursors with a charge state of 2–7 and an intensity above the threshold of 5 × 103 were collected for MS/MS. The data dependent scan (DDS) parameters were set as follows: exclusion mass width relative reference mass in the low and high range 10 ppm, minimum signal threshold (counts) 500, default charge state 2, activation time 10 ms [44].  4.7.

12,methods12," Protein Identification and Quantification  MS raw spectra were processed through Proteome Discoverer and MaxQuant software following a two-step database-dependent search (data dependent scan (DDS)) approach, as reported previously [15]. Briefly, raw files were first processed by Thermo Proteome Discoverer software (v.2.2) and searched against the UniProt KB bacteria database. Methionine oxidation was set as the variable modification and the carbamidomethylation of cysteine as the fixed modification. The SequestHT node thresholds were set to “automatic”, and a filter considering only entries with at least one peptide per protein was chosen. All other filters and settings of the software were kept as default, including protein grouping with peptide confidence set as “high” and a delta Cn of 0.1. The percolator node supporting a strict maximum parsimony principle was activated with a false discovery rate of 1%.",2f1f0d34-113d-4c92-9dc0-5c8643983acd
13,methods13,"  The first data dependent scan (DDS) enabled the assessment of the microbial community composition at the family level, leading to the construction of a smaller in-house database accounting for the bacterial families identified in both the metaproteomics and 16S rRNA gene-sequencing investigations. The customized database was employed in the second data dependent scan (DDS) of the MS raw data performed on MaxQuant (v 1.6.17.0) set to LFQ modality for peptide identification and protein inference and quantification. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as the fixed modification and methionine oxidation as the variable modification. Two missed cleavage sites were allowed for in-silico protease digestion, and peptides had to be fully tryptic. All other parameters of the software were set as default, including peptide and protein false discovery rate (FDR) < 1%, at least 1 peptide per protein, precursor mass tolerance of 4.",ee55d6cc-ef20-46c6-8a2f-c9e262c68624

The mass spectrometry proteomics data were deposited into the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD032280.  4.7.2. Ecological and Functional Characterization of Microbiota by Metaproteomics  Information on the taxonomic composition of the microbiota, as assessed by the identified protein repertoire, was gathered from the protein annotation of the UniProt KB database, whereas the quantitative microbiota composition was determined based on the LFQ intensities relative to each bacterial member on a family basis. The logarithmic transformation of the cumulative intensities on a family basis was accomplished while comparing the microbiota composition in the diverse sample groups.  Identified protein repertoires were functionally categorized into biological processes and molecular functions according to the Gene Ontology (GO) data repository.",058c4bd5-923b-44e4-8fc2-78010a06c8bf

Principal component analysis (Principal component analysis (PCO)) was conducted based on the square root transformation of the protein LFQs. Statistical differences across the samples were calculated by performing ANOVA and permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Parametric T-tests assessing the discriminating role of the bacterial families in the microbiota composition were conducted, and the results were visualized in iMetalab using shiny apps (https://shiny.imetalab.ca/). Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was calculated using the galaxy platform (https://usegalaxy.org).

Conclusions  This is the first metaomics-based study of a typical raw goat milk cheese. Goat cheeses are commonly consumed and popular for their gustatory properties and health benefits. The combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the metaproteomic approach enabled the in-depth characterization of the composition and activity of the microbiota at different cheese-wheel depths and provided insights into the structural dynamics of the microbial community during ripening. Altogether, this explorative study provided basic knowledge on the microbial community harbored in this fascinating dairy product and offered suggestions for further objective-tailored research lines.",00aaa9ab-b8ec-461b-9166-3ab0066d397a
