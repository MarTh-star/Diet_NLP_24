0,methods0," 4.1. Plant Material and Growing Conditions  A collection of 106 common bean accessions, from the Portuguese plant germplasm bank (BPGV, INIAV, Braga, Portugal) was used for the present genetic study. This collection was the same as described by Leitão et al. [26,27] to identify genomic regions controlling fusarium wilt resistance and photosynthetic efficiency-related traits in common bean. Based on genotypic data, it is known that this collection is mainly composed of accessions belonging to the Andean gene pool and a smaller proportion to the Mesoamerican gene pool. Additionally, one-third of the accessions have an admixed origin and might represent putative hybrids between the Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools [24].  Seeds from the bean accessions were sown in two different environments following a randomized complete block design, with two replicates at each environment, as described by Mecha et al. [25]. The field trials were developed in two different years and locations.",971d070a-15e8-4529-ab0f-00d68bf2f283
1,methods1," The first field trial took place from May to September 2014 in Cabrela, Portugal, and the second from March to July 2015 in Córdoba, Spain. Cabrela represents a standard common bean production area in Portugal, characterized by temperature average ranges of 18–21 °C and 66–80% of relative humidity during the growing season, whereas Córdoba represents a heat stress prone area, characterized by temperature average ranges of 15–32 °C and 31–63% of relative humidity during the growing season. The two field trials were established under artificial irrigation. Mature dried seeds were collected from a total of 106 accessions, 66 in both environments, 12 exclusively in Cabrela (environment with a total of 78 accessions) and 28 exclusively in Córdoba (environment with a total of 94 accessions). The mature dried seeds were milled to a particle size of 0.8 mm and stored at −20 °C until chemical analysis.  4.2.",966df43b-4458-4f2a-9d60-6588c19d5274
2,methods2," Phenotypic Data Acquisition  Twenty-three traits related to nutritional composition and protein quality were measured in the common bean harvested from the two field trials as described by Mecha et al. [25] and retrieved for the present genetic association study. Total protein, total carbohydrates (CH), fat, fiber, moisture and ash contents, were measured in the samples from Córdoba and Cabrela, and the contents of 16 different amino acids (Ala-alanine; Arg-arginine; Asp-spartic acid; Glu-glutamic acid; Gly-glycine; His-histidine; Ile-isoleucine; Leu-leucine; Lys-lysine; Met-methionine; Phe-phenylalanine; Pro-proline; Ser-serine; Thr-threonine; Tyr-tyrosine; Val-valine) and trypsin inhibitor activity (trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA)), were measured only in the samples from the most stressful environment (Córdoba). In addition, in the present study, resistant starch (RS) content was measured in all the harvested samples, completing a total of 24 traits analyzed.  Briefly, Mecha et al.",cd269806-705f-48a2-8c5d-656c8f41cc7c
3,methods3," [25] determined total protein, fat, fiber, moisture and ash (%) content using a near-infrared (near infrared (NIR)) analyzer (MPA; Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). Total carbohydrates were calculated following Equation (1):total carbohydrates = 100 − (total protein + total fat + moisture + ash).(1)  A LC-MS/MS system Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC system coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, Micromass® Quattro micro API (Micromass, Waters, Milford, MA, USA), equipped with an electrospray ionization source (electrospray ionization source (ESI)) was used to determine the content of the 16 amino acids [25]. Protein was hydrolyzed using a solution of HCL 6 M with 0.1% of phenol and the final amino acid extract resulted from the resuspension of the hydrolysates in HCL 0.1M after the evaporation to dryness of the initial solution.  The chromatographic separation was performed in a Mediterranean Sea 18, 5 µm 20 × 0.21 cm, 1.8 µm, (Teknokroma®, Barcelona, Spain) column.",bd25056a-3a4c-4500-94bc-014426b5db0a
4,methods4," The amino acids were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring (multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)) mode, using an electrospray ionization source (ESI) source operating in ion positive mode. Amino acids were identified by comparison with the amino acids’ standard retention time and corresponding m/z values.  Trypsin inhibitors were extracted from 0.5 g of common bean flour to which 25 mL of NaOH 0.01M were added, and the pH was adjusted to 9.5 ŷ 0.1. Inhibition percentage and trypsin inhibitor activity were calculated according to Mecha et al. [25]. Resistant starch was quantified following the methods American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) 32-40.01 [45] and Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC) 2002.02 [46]. The method was performed using a Resistant Starch Assay Kit (K-RSTAR, Megazyme, Bray, Ireland). A buffer solution of sodium maleate (pH 6.0), containing pancreatic α-amylase and amyloglucosidase, was added to the thawed samples of common bean flour.",918e00dc-8db3-40b6-a80f-e8439f24f1b5
5,methods5," The samples were incubated in a water bath with horizontal agitation (100 rpm) at 37 °C for 36 h. The reaction was interrupted with the addition of ethanol (99%). The solution was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet, containing resistant starch, was washed two additional times with ethanol (50%) followed by centrifugation. The resulting pellet was resuspended in potassium hydroxide (2M) under continuous agitation in an ice and water bath for 20 min. The solution was then neutralized with a buffer solution of sodium acetate (pH 3.8). The existing starch was hydrolyzed to glucose through the action of the amyloglucosidase in a water bath at 50 °C for 30 min. The samples were centrifugated, and two 0.1 mL aliquots were collected from the liquid phase. Simultaneously, a blank sample was prepared with 0.1 mL of sodium acetate 0.1 M (pH 4.5) as well as four standard glucose solutions with 0.1 mL of glucose solution (1 mg/mL).",1827b39d-b64e-43c8-b0f6-b0bc30c14fcb
6,methods6," For glucose quantification, through spectrophotometry, 3 mL of glucose oxidase/peroxidase reagent were added to each tube, followed by a 50 °C incubation for 20 min. The absorbance of the samples was evaluated at 510 nm against the blank sample. The average glucose content of each sample was compared to the absorbance values of the standard glucose solutions to obtain the concentration of resistant starch.  4.3. Phenotypic Data Analysis  Quality control of phenotypic data was performed separately for each environment. Technical repetitions were averaged for each accession to minimize technical error. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed using the summary statistics option of Genstat® software, 21st edition [47]. Histograms and boxplots were generated per trait to analyze data distribution and to identify outliers. The normality of residuals was assessed for each trait using the Shapiro-Wilk test.",e9efa130-7787-4cac-8597-61ec3a44971d
7,methods7," A Box-Cox transformation was applied when needed to meet normality assumptions.  A linear mixed model was fitted per trait as trait = genotype + block + error for the analysis of traits measured in a single environment and as trait = genotype + environment + genotype x environment + block + error for the analysis of traits measured in both environments using the restricted maximum likelihood (restricted maximum likelihood (REML)) variance component analysis framework of Genstat software, where environment identifies the two field trials and block identifies the two plot replicates within each trial.  Models were initially fitted with all terms as random to obtain the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs), estimate variance components, broad-sense heritability and Pearson correlation coefficients between traits. In a second step, genotype and block were fitted as fixed terms to obtain the best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs), for each trait and accession.",cebb250e-c747-42be-9716-063b5da63a4d
8,methods8," BLUEs were determined for fat with genotype and environment fitted as fixed terms. Wald tests for the significance of fixed effects were performed. BLUEs were used for principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) and as input phenotypic data for genome wide association study (GWAS).  To estimate how much of the variation of accessions’ nutritional composition could be explained by the environment or the interaction with the environment, the previously defined model was fitted considering environment and genotype × environment as fixed terms, and a Wald test was performed to test for the significance of the fixed effects.  4.4. Genotypic Data  4.4.1. Association-Mapping Analysis  Genome-wide association studies were conducted for all the 24 traits using the quantitative trait loci (QTL) library procedures from Genstat software.",b06584c2-87c2-4283-913f-0f41df4ae310
9,methods9," Adjusted means (BLUEs) for each trait were tested for association with a previously collected genotypic dataset [26] retrieved for the present study. This genotypic dataset was constituted of 9601 single nucleotide polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s) after quality control (removal of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and accessions with >25% missing data, as well as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s with a minor allele frequency <0.01 from the 16,689 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s originally screened) and was obtained through two different approaches, the Illumina Infinium BARCBean6k_3 BeadChipTM assay and DArTseqTM analysis [26]. single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s called heterozygous were set as missing data. Furthermore, some accessions were not phenotyped for some of the traits.",4074fb20-4712-45fd-ab62-2f116ffc40a8
10,methods10," Thus, association mapping was performed using 72 accessions for the amino acid contents and trypsin inhibitor activity and 94 accessions for the remaining traits measured in seeds from Córdoba; and for 78 accessions for all the traits measured in Cabrela.  genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed separately for Cabrela and Córdoba environments for the traits that showed a higher variance component of genotype by environment (GxE) interaction than of genotype (G). Otherwise, the association study was performed with data from both environments together. genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed in the mixed model framework of Genstat software, fitting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as fixed and genotype as random terms using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) [48].",905529f8-91fc-47e1-bd00-06e15ff4f32c
11,methods11," Four models were tested to detect significant marker-trait association: a null model [Phenotype = single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) + Error], which does not account for any population structure or familial relatedness; a model accounting for population structure (Q) [Phenotype = Q + single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) + Error], using 15 principal components from the principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)); and two models accounting for familial relatedness (K) [Phenotype = single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) + genotype + Error], one with genotype random effects structured following a kinship matrix K [48,49]; and another using a different kinship matrix calculated for each chromosome using only the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s located on the remaining 10 chromosomes, as proposed by Cheng et al. [50]. The kinship matrices to account for familial relatedness per chromosome among genotypes were previously calculated by Leitão et al.",daa6c0b1-76d0-4577-8157-9774deaffe24
12,methods12, [26] and retrieved to perform the present association studies. Inflation factor values near 1 and quantile-quantile (Q–Q) plots of the respective p-values with lower deviations from the expected uniform distribution under the null hypothesis were the considered parameters to select the best model accounting for genetic structure/relatedness among genotypes.  The observed −log10 (p-value) of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was plotted against its chromosomal position to produce a Manhattan plot. Significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-trait associations were detected at a threshold of −log10 (p-value) = 3. This threshold was set taking into consideration two aspects: the size of the association panel used and the background noise of the obtained Manhattan plots.,bf479b74-1ed5-4bd5-960f-abee54cbbb53
13,methods13," Similar criteria were already described in other works with comparable panel sizes and a similar number of markers, focusing on resistance/tolerance traits [26] to avoid losing potentially interesting regions while applying a conservative type of adjustment such as Bonferroni correction. However, as a “conservative” guidance, adjusted p-values following the Benjamini and Yekutieli (BY) false discovery rate (false discovery rate (FDR)) method [51] were calculated, with α = 0.2 and k = 520 (the effective number of independent tests was set as the number of LD blocks per chromosome [52]), to control type I errors due to multiple testing.  For every single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) significantly associated with a trait, the effect of the minor-frequency single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant was calculated.",5e9f3dd1-5250-434b-b587-c2db11d096c7
14,methods14," The proportion of variance explained by each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-trait association was estimated using the formula Vquantitative trait loci (QTL)/Vpheno, where Vquantitative trait loci (QTL) = 2freq(1-freq)effect2 and Vpheno is the phenotypic variance of the adjusted means of each trait [53].  4.4.2. Candidate Gene Identification  A gene was considered a putative candidate for the phenotypic trait under analysis if it contained an associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or was in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with an associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) observing a strict LD-decay threshold (r2 > 0.2). LD was previously calculated for each common bean chromosome using the squared coefficient of the correlation between marker pairs r2 [26], and retrieved for the present study. Neighbouring single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s showing r2 > 0.",33a1f738-83fd-41cf-b6fa-eb475ff54066
15,methods15,"2 in relation to the associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s were considered to be within the same LD block or genomic region. Putative candidate genes were searched for using the JBrowse tool in the Phaseolus vulgaris v2.1 genome (DOE-JGI and USDA-NIFA, http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/, accessed on 16 December 2021), available at the Phytozome v12 portal [54]. The annotation of the candidate genes was obtained from the file “Pvulgaris_442_v2.1.annotation_info.txt”, available in the previously referred portal.  Candidate genes were also assigned to MapMan bins, which described biological contexts/concepts, using Mercator4 V2.0 [55]. Cytoscape software [56], version 3.8.2, was used to visualize the candidate genes associated with each trait as a network.
