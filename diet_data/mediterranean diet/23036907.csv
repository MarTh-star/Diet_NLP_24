0,introduction0,"The mechanisms by which a successful aging occurs in humans, i.e. aging in good psychophysical conditions [1], are immunologically characterized by preserved lymphoproliferative responses and Natural Killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity as well as conserved antigen presentation (reviewed in [2,3]). BELFAST nonagenarians show evidence of a competent immune system, programmed with increase in the number and/or the proportion of NK cells to scan presumably for virus-infected, stressed and malignant cells [4]. In others studies, an increase in NK cells showing a mature phenotype was found in healthy elderly donors who had an NK cytotoxic capacity of total peripheral blood lymphocytes preserved [5,6]. Such preservation in healthy elderly may be due to a high number of NK cells in order to compensate low NK cell cytotoxicity and cytokine and chemokine production [7].  The decline in immune function with age is unanimously recognized and supported by epidemiologic and clinical studies [8].",ccc1880f-4bbf-4dd3-8f05-5cee8772f1a1
1,introduction1," We have reported that several metabolic and nutritional factors, including insulin, retinoic acid or carotenoids affect the immune response in function of age in healthy volunteers [9-13]. However, the development of age-related changes in health status in elderly men have led to conflicting results and these discrepancies may be partially ascribed to the population tested, i.e. presence of concomitant pathologic disorders or nutritional deficiencies that may affect the immune status (reviewed in [14-17]). To overcome this problem, volunteers in the present study were recruited according to the SENIEUR protocol, which used strict clinical and biological inclusion criteria (i.e. good nutritional status, absence of disease, no sign of inflammation or infection, no drug delivery) as well as rigorous exclusion criteria with detailed measurement of the immune markers [18].",b01d941a-b4d8-42af-9a8c-56628d98dcb3
2,introduction2,"  In Europe, the prevalence and the geographical variation of symptoms associated with a putative “aging syndrome” have never been documented. A recent multi-centre study was designed from male volunteers to specify age-related changes in hormone levels, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors that exist across Europe [19]. However, the effects of aging on biomarkers of immune status, measured at baseline in healthy individuals from different European countries, have never been reported. The geographical comparisons are of particular interest, since in addition to the immunological status, various potential predisposing risk factors such as the dietary, lifestyle habits, genetic and socioeconomic factors are different from a country to another [20,21].",d7cdbe51-1a74-4376-b101-4bf59a871bf4
3,introduction3,"  The aim of the present work was to provide descriptive information on the biomarkers of immune status in 300 healthy volunteers aged between 20–75 years recruited in Austria, Spain and France and having participated in our previous EU-funded studies [22-25]. The number of about 100 subjects in each country has been chosen on the basis of the results of power calculations for those biomarkers with known distribution in humans, and assuming to detect biologically significant differences in each case. The decision to limit this project only to male subjects has been based on the observation that changes in hormonal status that occur in women, both within and between subjects of this wide age range, may affect the immune status [26].  Our preliminary and primarily descriptive analyses showed that there are moderate differences in the immune status of middle-aged to older inhabitants of the three European centres.",33cdc8e8-90f3-4260-9ade-e3e1e24821ac

7,methods2," All volunteers from a given centre had the usual diet of their respective country, which is the diet of the general population. Venous blood samples were collected from subjects in the fasting state for serum and leukocyte isolation and storage until analysis. The SENIEUR protocol standardized the selection of the volunteers for immunological studies [18].  The mean age ± SEM of the volunteers from France, Austria and Spain was 46.8 ± 1.5 y, 45.6 ± 1.5 y and 46.3 ± 1.6 y, respectively (no significant difference). In each country, the volunteers were classified in six different age groups: 20–29 y (n = 59), 30–39 y (n = 55), 40–49 y (n = 59), 50–59 y (n = 51), 60–69 y (n = 56) and 70–75 y (n = 20).

9,methods4," The skin tests were read at 48 h after application by measuring for each antigen the induration response (mean of two perpendicular diameters) using a gradual scale. Induration ≥2 mm was recorded as positive response and corrected by substracting the negative control, if any [60]. The cumulative score was calculated as the sum of all antigen indurations. This score was considered as “hypoergic” (<10 mm with at least one positive response ≥2 mm) or “anergic” (no response greater than 2 mm) or “normal” (≥10 mm with at least one positive response ≥2mm) according to Kniker et al. [29].  Determination of blood leukocyte phenotype In each recruitment centre, blood leukocytes were isolated using Ficoll density gradient (Histopaque®1077 and 1119, Sigma-Aldrich) and then cryopreserved [61]. Briefly, cells were progressively frozen in a Cryo-Med liquid nitrogen freezer and conserved at -196°C during at most 6 months. Such cryopreservation did not affect the cell surface markers [62].",590b1327-2df1-45b6-904a-43b1a1a9b0c7

In France, Spain and Austria, individuals had IgA levels positively correlated with age (r2 = +0.2, p = 0.04). Accordingly, an age effect was found for IgA serum levels which were significantly higher in subjects aged 40 years old or more compared to younger individuals (Figure 1).

Despite different dietary habits, lifestyle, genetic and socio economic factors, we found only moderate variations in the biomarkers, the most striking being an increased distribution of NK cells in Spain, compared to France and Austria, while a higher delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response and an enhanced CD4/CD8 ratio were found in Austria. Interestingly, the immune parameters in our French volunteers had constantly intermediate values between those measured in Austrian and Spanish individuals, thus reflecting the importance of a geographic variability on the immune status and possible gradual differences in the dietary, lifestyle habits, environmental, genetic and socio-economic factors between Southern and Northern Europe. Immunosenescence affects all compartments of the immune system.",029946d4-ebd7-4ff3-b738-8fc84bbe9697
24,discussion1," Age changes were demonstrated in T lymphocytes and in innate immunity, including NK cells. A decline in CD4 count, a rise in CD8 compartment and an increase in the NK cell numbers with well-preserved [30] or reduced cytotoxic function [31,32] has been considered as a “remodelling” of the immune compartment with aging [30].  NK cell status and longevity In our Spanish population (mean age 46.3 y), we observed an increase in the percentage of NK cells in elderly people when compared to young controls (32.3 ± 3.4 in elderly over 70 y vs 19.1 ± 2 in young aged 20 to 29 y). This is consistent with the findings of Borrego et al. who also observed a significant increase in the percentage of CD56+ cells in aged Spanish donors when compared to the young controls (29.1 ± 10.1 in elderly over 81 y vs 14.8 ± 5.3 in young aged 32 y) [33].",0459e06d-147a-417c-a9f0-e3762067c919
25,discussion2," Moreover, we found that the percentage of NK cells was significantly higher in Spanish than in French or Austrian subjects, and this was observed at any age group above 30 years. The NK cell status is thought to be an important component of the aging immune system [5,7] and can predict morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Low NK cell number and function are associated with increased mortality and greater risk of severe infections in elderly subjects [34,35]. Conversely, a well preserved functional status of NK cells until very advanced age is linked to healthy ageing and longevity [5], emphasizing the importance of innate as well as adaptive immunity in ensuring healthy longevity [30] and possibly cancer resistance [36,37]. Thus, our results may be related to the fact that life expectancy at birth is greater in Spain (over 80 y) as compared to France or Austria (below 80 y) [38].",0ef321d2-2dd4-49a9-ac39-d2725a3220e4
26,discussion3,"  Environmental factors and immune biomarkers An aging-related deficiency in the immunosurveillance system (especially NK cells) may play a role in pathogenesis and in particular, in cancer. Since many environmental factors are mutagenic and promote cancer, we can speculate that aging is clearly related to the duration of exposure to these factors and their effects on immune system. For example, pollution affects the number of NK cells but also of CD4+, CD8+ and B lymphocytes [39]. As such, we cannot rule out that the differences in lymphocyte distribution observed between the three countries may be explained by differential environmental factors such as pollution or others.  Impact of diet on immune aging As the consumption of fruits and vegetables is higher in Spain than in the other European countries [40,41], an important role for the dietary patterns in the healthy aging of the elderly has been suggested [42,43].",3c0a5de7-6d93-4238-b2a0-db8f08a69259
27,discussion4," In Europe, prospective studies have shown that adherence to a typical Mediterranean diet is associated with lower mortality and increased longevity [41,44-46]. The effects of such a diet on immune status have not been reported. In one recent study conducted in patients with high risk of cardiovascular diseases, the Mediterranean diet, compared to a control low-fat diet, seems to down-regulate immune cell activation but not T lymphocyte percent change [47]. In the meta-analysis of 12 prospective studies [48], a two-point increase in a score of Mediterranean diet adherence was associated with improved health status, as shown by a significant reduction in mortality (9%), cardiovascular diseases (9%), cancer (6%), and the incidence of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease (13%). However, as this benefit was also apparent in non-Mediterranean populations [47,48], a direct role of diet on aging remains unclear and cannot fully explain our results.",c4e0c7f3-db04-43ce-acc9-7aefc9d6de8b
28,discussion5," NK cells and their cytolytic activity have also been related to nutrition including vitamin D and anthropometric markers [49]. Preliminary results from an Irish study indicate a small negative relationship between NK cell number and body mass index [4].  Age effect on immune status In our well-defined healthy population, we found serum IgA levels were correlated with age, which is in agreement with other studies [27] and suggests either a complex derangement of B cell function with age [50] or a remodelling of the immune system rather than a deterioration [51]. Comparison between age groups showed that IgA levels were higher in subjects above 40 y. It is noteworthy that the same cut-off was observed for other immune biomarkers (B, CD4 and CD8 cell distribution, CD4/CD8 ratio), suggesting that a decline in immune function leading to the healthy aging process may start in the early age.",6ec34eb4-34b9-43bd-825d-14814dc86162
29,discussion6," By recruiting only male volunteers in our study, we have excluded any possible influence of immune status by hormonal changes that occur with age in women. We also found alterations in the immune capacity reflected by a greater proportion of NK cells, a decrease in B lymphocytes but a stable number of T cells. When all European volunteers were classified as a function of age, NK distribution was significantly increased with age (17% in 20–29 y vs 24% in 70 y), in agreement with previous findings ([52]: 18% in 29 y vs 30% in 86 y; [53]: 14% in 20–29 y vs 20% in 70–75 y). Although the alterations of NK cells and other innate immune cells with aging are generally less marked than those seen with T cells [16,54], we observed that in our subjects, a greater correlation with age was found for NK cells (r2 = +0.21, p = 0.0002) than for CD4/CD8 ratio (r2 = +0.14, p = 0.01). A similar positive correlation between age and CD4/CD8 ratio in Irish individuals was reported by Rea et al. [4].",52252dfd-4081-4a8e-a138-2384892ab823
30,discussion7," Moreover, we observed a shift from a predominance of naïve T cells towards T cells expressing memory phenotypes from the youngest to the oldest age groups, as previously reported [12,55]. This shift may result from the age-related repetition of antigenic challenges.  Vaccination and immune response The mechanisms of vaccination are complex and may differ depending on the allergen and the route of immunization. We observed that the most frequent delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses were observed for tetanus and tuberculin which represent two common antigens. As the vaccination coverage against the different antigens used in our study has not been reported in Europe, it is unclear why we observed enhanced delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in our Austrian volunteers, as compared to the subjects from the other two European centres. Whether this finding could be explained by a better vaccination status or linked to booster doses in elderly people in Austria is unlikely.",7d020d0c-4866-490e-bb13-17ee9e0fecdf
31,discussion8," Based on the influenza vaccination coverage rate in the general population (aged 14 to 75 years), it was of 26.4% in France and 23.7% in Spain, during the period 2007-2008 [56]. By comparison, the vaccination coverage rate during the same period was significantly lower in Austria (16.0%), where vaccination is costly and results in socioeconomic inequalities regarding immunization in the general population [57]. In addition, adherence to vaccination programs may differ between European countries. For example, tuberculin skin testing to make decision about BCG revaccination was described to be routinely performed in France but not in Austria [58].

32,discussion9,"  Conclusion This study compares for the first time the immune status in three European countries and describes the effects of aging on immune cell distribution. The differences observed from a country to another can be explained by genetic, environmental, dietary and socioeconomic variations. This variability should be taken into account when estimating, in future nutrition research studies, the actual immune status of healthy individuals with different geographical origins.
