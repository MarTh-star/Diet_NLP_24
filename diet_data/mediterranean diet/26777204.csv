0,background0,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women and the 5-year survival rate in Europe is 82% suggesting a considerable residual risk [1]. BC is associated also with other chronic conditions including type two diabetes which may increase the risk of BC recurrence [2–4] and many BC patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) [5, 6]. Mechanisms of BC appear to be linked to sex hormones, impairment in glucose metabolism, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin-like growth factors (insulin like growth factors (IGF)), inflammation, oxidative stress and impaired cell apoptosis [7, 8]. Current advice to BC survivors suggests adopting cancer prevention strategies [8, 9], however there is no consensus on the effectiveness of lifestyle programs in women with BC [10–12] mostly due to lack of sufficient evidence [13].",6312b6e9-6c2b-4dd8-90f5-cf0f0a581459
1,background1," The rationale for the study is to target several mechanisms of cancer suppression or proliferation, with a healthy diet and exercise program, to avoid low vitamin D levels in order to obtain maximal efficacy of the lifestyle program, and concomitantly to offer maximal cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes protection. Dietary carbohydrates are the main food components to affect glycemia and insulinemia. The glycemic index (GI) is able to capture the difference between those that increase glycemia the most (high GI foods) and those that increase it the least (low GI foods) [14]. Low GI foods lower the glycemic and insulinemic potential of the diet and have been shown to reduce the risk of several cancers particularly diabetes-related cancers including BC [15–18] and some evidence suggests they also correlate with lower recurrence [19].",40eadc88-55ed-4568-a76d-dfcbe158eb4a
2,background2," Furthermore, low GI diets have been inversely associated with risk of type two diabetes [15, 20, 21] and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [22, 23] and favourably modified blood glucose [24–26], blood lipids [27], inflammatory markers [28], oxidative damage [29], body weight [30] and insulin like growth factors (IGF) binding proteins [31], all factors relevant to carcinogenesis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our previous studies in Italy have shown significant risk reduction of 40% with a low GI diet compared to a high GI diet in BC primary prevention [18]. Physical activity is one of the mainstays of primary prevention of cancer and it is also included in guidelines for BC survivors (at least 150 minutes per week) mainly to reduce complications such as lower muscle strength and risk of depression [13].",26acb401-a261-463c-bd8a-05c75fc62afd
3,background3," However, physical activity after BC diagnosis has also been shown to reduce the risk of BC mortality by 40–50% particularly when it is of moderate intensity such as 30 minutes of brisk walking per day [32–35] an effect possibly modulated partly by insulin economy improvements in reduced insulin, insulin-like growth factors and estrogen levels [36].  To maximize lifestyle changes it may be useful to avoid vitamin deficiencies, particularly vitamin D deficiency which has been linked to higher breast cancer risk [37, 38]. Vitamin D alters genes implicated in cellular growth, affecting proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis [37]. Preliminary studies suggest that normal-high ranges of serum vitamin D levels improve BC survival [39, 40].",53309346-2367-4b7f-afa8-5fb676eafa5d
4,background4,"  Low glycemic index diet, exercise and vitamin D intake, in addition to determining metabolic changes and benefits for cancer patients, may be able to change the tumor microenvironment and lead to epigenetic modifications [41–44]. In this context, microRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNA molecules, may play a fundamental role in modulating gene expression and breast cancer progression [45, 46]. The evaluation of circulating miRNAs is useful to identify the change of specific miRNAs involved in cancer pathways and predict the development of recurrence in breast cancer patients.  A lifestyle program that targets all the above mechanisms may be warranted. To our knowledge no trial has evaluated the combined effect of a lifestyle program with a healthy diet focusing on low GI, additional physical activity and supplemental vitamin D on BC recurrence and complications in the context of a Mediterranean dietary setting.",fd141792-b35d-4c5d-b8bc-b7d0963825bb
5,background5,"  Methods/Design Aims and objectives DEDiCa study aims primarily at reducing BC recurrence in women with BC using a lifestyle approach with additional vitamin D. The primary objective of DEDiCa study is to determine the effect of a 33-month program combining advice on diet, exercise and supplemental vitamin D, on reducing BC recurrence rates or increasing disease-free survival (disease free survival (DFS)). Secondary objectives are to improve markers of diabetes risk and management for those who already have diabetes, to improve cardiometabolic health and quality of life (QoL) and to investigate whether changes in microRNA correlate with changes in lifestyle.  Study design This is a randomized clinical trial targeting women with BC stages I-III within 12 months from BC surgery (see Tables 1 and 2 for details).

34,methods1," Dietary and exercise counselling and vitamin D supplements will be given at each clinic visit when blood samples, anthropometric measures and 7-day food records will be collected. ",1771636d-8b49-4010-afbd-335b16b22fc7
35,discussion0,"The purpose of this study is to reduce BC recurrence and hence increase disease-free survival through a lifestyle program that includes a low glycemic index diet, physical activity and vitamin D supplementation in women with BC living in a Mediterranean country. It is expected that the higher intensity program of low GI diet, exercise and vitamin D will reduce BC recurrence by 50% compared to the lower intensity program.  Dietary clinical trials to reduce BC recurrence have been conducted previously. In the USA two large studies were conducted, the Women’s Intervention Nutrition trial (Women’s Intervention Nutrition trial (WIN)) and the Women’s Healthy Eating and Living trial (Women’s Healthy Eating and Living trial (WHEL)).",7a00d73f-97bc-4795-ac41-f2882444c4ac
36,discussion1," The Women’s Intervention Nutrition trial (WIN) study which focused on a low-fat diet found a 24% reduction in BC recurrence after 5 years compared to a control of minimal dietary counselling [10], whereas the Women’s Healthy Eating and Living trial (WHEL) study focusing on a combination of low-fat and high-fruit and -vegetable diet did not reduce BC recurrence after a 7-year intervention compared to a lower intensity fruit and vegetables advice [11]. This null result may be partly explained by methodology aspects as most women had early stage BC and one of the inclusion criteria was the diagnosis of BC within 4 years. It is possible that such a diet may be protective if consumed earlier, possibly within 1 year of diagnosis as in the Women’s Intervention Nutrition trial (WIN) study [10].",3950166d-e633-4488-a7a3-cd8f282902d3
37,discussion2," However, in the Women’s Healthy Eating and Living trial (WHEL) study, women who at baseline consumed more than 3 servings of vegetables per day showed a 30% reduction in BC recurrence and an even greater reduction (up to 52%) in tamoxifen users [55]. Furthermore, women who at baseline consumed at least 5 portions of vegetables/fruit per day and additionally walked for at least 30 min a day had a 44% higher chance of survival, independently of obesity, suggesting that obesity did not impact on lowering survival if people adhered to a healthy lifestyle pattern [56]. Overall these large clinical trials suggest the importance of intervening early after diagnosis and that plant-based diets and half hour daily walk may be protective from future recurrence. The low fat advice may however be appropriate only in countries with high intakes of saturated fat. In Mediterranean countries where diets are characterized by high intakes of olive oil, reducing fat intakes may not be beneficial.",5eab048a-30c9-40d3-a31c-b9db16e4e720
38,discussion3," In the PREDIMED intervention trial, women without BC but following the intensive Mediterranean dietary advice with high olive oil intakes showed up to 68% lower risk of BC compared with those on lower olive oil intake [57]. The traditional Mediterranean diet, rich in plant food and olive oil, has been associated with protection from BC risk [58, 59] cardiovascular disease (CVD) events [60], type two diabetes risk [61] and complications [62, 63] and favour weight loss [64]. However, adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet has halved from the 60’s to 2003 in Mediterranean countries including Italy [65], hence there may be health benefits in improving the current Mediterranean style dietary pattern. The Italian diet is very rich in carbohydrates, particularly bread and other fast absorbing carbohydrates (high GI foods) which have been associated with higher risk of BC as well as other chronic conditions [15, 16, 18, 66].",33beb262-99a6-4ba2-a993-a2c43272c9f9
39,discussion4," Since factors influencing the metabolism of glucose may play a relevant role in the development of chronic diseases including BC [15], it is possible that lowering the GI of the Mediterranean diet of Italian women with BC through guided dietary advice, a lower recurrence may be achieved. Chronic elevation of insulin concentrations may be one of the mechanisms explaining the positive association between dietary GI and cancer risk [67]. High GI diets increase blood glucose and insulin levels more than low GI diets and hence may be involved in increasing insulin like growth factors (IGF)-1 bioavailability [31]. Insulin is an anabolic hormone able to increase insulin like growth factors (IGF)-1 synthesis and activity and insulin like growth factors (IGF)-1 in turn may promote cancer development by inhibiting apoptosis, stimulating cell proliferation and sex-steroid synthesis [68, 69].",a30cfb94-f8b2-4c8f-b660-f60f8147b57e
40,discussion5," Another mechanism for high GI-related increased cancer risk may be through hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress [70, 71] which has been implicated in free radical-dependent DNA damage, known as a contributor to carcinogenesis [72, 73]. Within normal ranges of glycemia higher levels of normal have been directly associated with BC risk in previously healthy women [74] and with higher recurrence rates in women with BC [75]. Another potential mechanism may be through lowering the availability of circulating glucose following low GI diets and exercise. Cancer cells are avid consumers of glucose due to their altered metabolism characterized by insufficient oxidative phosphorylation and compensatory glucose fermentation (the Warburg effect) [76]. This results in lactic acid production and higher protons which acidify the external cellular microenvironment reaching a pH of 6.5-6.9 [77]. A lower pH may provide a competing survival and metastatic advantage for cancer cells (e.g.",587b11df-84fb-470a-93a4-29e171f96f34
41,discussion6," greater spreading capacity) over normal cells unable to survive below a pH of 7.2 [77, 78] and may induce drug resistance of weak base-anticancer drugs (e.g. doxorubicin) [78].  Physical activity after BC diagnosis has also been shown to reduce the risk of BC mortality by 40-50% particularly when it is of moderate intensity such as 30 minutes of brisk walking per day [32–35]. This effect may be modulated partly by reduced insulin, insulin-like growth factors and estrogen levels [36, 79, 80] which are associated with BC recurrence and death [81, 82]. Furthermore, physical activity can improve insulin sensitivity, reduce blood triglycerides, blood pressure and body fat [83–85].",8c2a61f5-fc3e-4f85-8307-dd5285350c11
42,discussion7," The lifestyle changes proposed in this study (lower dietary GI, enhanced Mediterranean diet, physical activity) may also induce weight loss which in turn may improve insulin sensitivity, insulin like growth factors (IGF) profile and reduce aromatase activity in adipose tissue with consequent reduction in estrogen levels [86], particularly relevant in postmenopausal women [87]. Although weight loss is not a goal of the DEDiCa study, participants will be allowed to lose weight in situations of overwheight or obesity should they wish to. The secondary statistical analyses will take into consideration this aspect.  Lifestyle changes may be more efficacious in a setting of vitamin D sufficiency. Vitamin D alters genes implicated in cellular growth, through upregulation of E-cadherin thereby stimulating cell differentiation and apoptosis [39]. Higher serum vitamin D levels (>30 ng/ml) in BC patients have been associated with 50% less fatality rates compared to lower levels (<20 ng/ml) [88].",b93a80a7-8a25-48f2-9973-4ae3ab7575eb
43,discussion8," The vitamin D dose–response relationship for BC appears inverse and linear up to 60 ng/ml [39]. These levels could achieve a 25% lower BC incidence and could be reached by supplementing 2000–4000 IU/day [53, 89]. The upper dose recommended by the National Academy of Sciences is 4000 IU/day [54]. The Italian guidelines for the prevention and treatment of hypovitaminosis D (SIOMMMS) indicate that in Italy this condition is present in 50% of young adults and at higher rates in older individuals [53]. The updated SIOMMMS guidelines for vitamin D deficiency (25-OH-D < 10 ng/ml) suggest up to 600,000 as a cumulative dose [90]. In Italy the normal range for circulating 25-OH-D is set between 30 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml while toxicity levels are considered above 150 ng/ml [53]. Vitamin D can also protect against bone loss and risk of fractures as a consequence of osteoporosis typically seen after postmenopause or after estrogen deprivation therapy used in BC treatment.",a8c351b2-2641-4a7b-8c9a-cf16b300efbc
44,discussion9," Hence vitamin D supplementation may also reduce adverse skeletal effects [53]. Furthermore, higher vitamin D levels have also been associated with reduced risk of developing diabetes [91, 92]. Continuous improvements in survival rates will have an impact on comorbidities and quality of life of BC survivors. Co-morbid conditions have been found at higher prevalence in cancer survivors than in age-matched controls [93] and in the subgroup of cancer patients presenting with two comorbidities, the most frequent combination of diseases appeared to be cardiovascular disease (CVD) in men and diabetes in women [94]. There are downstream effects of cancer therapy (e.g. radiation and chemotherapy) causing heart, respiratory, kidney and memory problems but also of hormone suppressing therapy in BC patients [95].",593ad44d-c4af-4330-bc8b-13c4d3306e76
45,discussion10," Compounding on this problem, cancer survivors fail to receive the same level of care for their comorbid condition compared to the general population [96] and this is especially true for type two diabetes [97]. Hence it may become even more relevant to implement cost-effective lifestyle risk reduction strategies. Two international cancer organizations have published lifestyle guidelines for cancer survivors, The American Cancer Society (American Cancer Society (ACS)) [8] and the World Cancer Research Fund (World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)) [9], however there is no agreement on a specific lifestyle program that could reduce BC recurrence and complications including recommendations on vitamin D supplementation.",c441d484-5b8f-4d2e-8e49-aaf9bd76a1ce
46,discussion11,"  DEDiCa study includes treatment components such as low GI, traditional Mediterranean foods, high dietary fiber and physical activity which have been shown to reduce risk factors for type two diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) including HbA1c, blood glucose and lipids, and inflammatory factors [15, 20, 22, 23, 25–28, 30, 60, 98–100].  This study will contribute to understanding the efficacy of lifestyle changes in a Mediterranean population of BC survivors with respect to several novel aspects: testing a lifestyle modification (diet and exercise) within normal vitamin D levels on disease-free survival; investigate lifestyle changes in relation to BC staging, molecular subtypes, menopausal status, body weight, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and events, diabetes control, new diabetes cases, quality of life, response to medication.",6b8a3262-1b0e-4d42-ac91-e2f68c266ac6
47,discussion12," It will also allow to understand breast carcinogenesis and the role of microRNA in BC and whether they are modulated by dietary and other lifestyle aspects. It will allow to investigate best time of treatment adherence since women will be enrolled within 12 months of surgery, some will have just started their cancer therapy and some will have ended.  Given the supporting evidence of important health effects and safety of the components of DEDiCa intervention we believe it is feasible and urgent to test this program in BC patients.",13c45acf-e7c8-470d-99b2-738295e1c171
