The age of the students ranged from 13 to 18 years (M = 15.34; SD = 1.22). The PE classes were held with equal rights and duties between students belonging to various secondary educational centers in Almeria and Burgos.  Informed consent from parents or legal guardians as well as voluntary participation in the study were the criteria for the inclusion of students in the study.  2.2. Instruments Perceived autonomy support. The Scale used was the Perceived Autonomy Support Scale for Exercise Settings (perceived autonomy support scale for exercise settings (PASSES); [35]), validated for the Spanish PE context [36]. The scale evaluates a single factor called autonomy support through 12 items. The scale ranges from totally disagreed (1) to totally agreed (7).  Psychological controlling.",138978e4-e5ec-46da-8ee1-a14850bcd362
1,methods1," The scale used was a version of the Psychologically Controlling Teaching Scale (PCTs; [37]), validated and adapted for the PE context [38]. The instrument consists of seven items with a single factor. The scale ranges from totally disagreed (1) to totally agreed (7).  Frustration of psychological needs: The scale utilized was the scale of Frustration of Psychological Needs, validated and adapted for the Spanish PE context [39]. The instrument consists of 17 items, distributed as follows among each of the factors that make up the scale: four items for competence, four items for relatedness, four items for autonomy, and five items for novelty. The scale ranges from not at all true (1) to totally true (7).  Resilience in PE. The instrument utilized was the Resilience Scale in PE classes [40]. This questionnaire consists of 25 items divided between two factors that measure acceptance of oneself and the context and personal competence.",f594492f-68d1-4bd7-8451-4978ca3f6d09
2,methods2," The scale ranges from total disagreement (1) to total agreement (7).  Motivation. The instrument utilized was the Perceived Locus of Causality Revised (PLOC-R; [41]), validated and adapted for the Spanish context of PE [42]. The questionnaire consists of 23 items divided into six factors that measure different kinds of motivation. The scale ranges from not at all true (1) to totally true (7).  For this study, the self-determination index (self determination index (SDI)) was calculated to quantify the level of self-determination [43] using the following formula: 3 × intrinsic motivation, 2 × integrated regulation, 1 × identified regulation, −1 × introjected regulation, −2 × external regulation, and −3 × demotivation.  Practice of physical activity. The Spanish version [44] of the WHO Health Behavior of Schoolchildren Survey [45] was used.",ebba8f0e-7c7b-4d8c-a451-c3df3282f682
3,methods3," For this study, we selected indices that referred to the practice of physical activity; an index was calculated based on the number of days per week of each physical activity and the duration of the sessions. For a more detailed explanation of the indices and their validity, see Balaguer [44].  Mediterranean diet. The kidmed scale [46], which measures dietary patterns related to the Mediterranean diet, was used. This scale has an index oscillating from 0 to 12 across 16 questions. Those questions with a negative connotation with respect to the Mediterranean diet were assigned a value of −1, and those with a positive connotation were assigned +1.  2.3. Procedure Once the questionnaires were selected, several educational centers were contacted whose PE teachers were briefed of the aims of the present study in relation to resilience, motivation, and the adoption of healthy dietary patterns and the practice of physical activity.",85be3879-699a-4295-8a21-122802b2fb96
4,methods4," Subsequently, those students who wished to participate in the present study were required to obtain written authorization from their parents or legal guardians, since they were minors. The scales were given before the beginning of PE classes during the third week of February of the academic year 2018/2019, with the answers to the questionnaires being anonymous.  El estudio se llevó a cabo en cumplimiento de las directrices de la Asociación Psicológica Americana. The Research Ethics Committee of the University of Almeria, Spain, approved the present study (Ref. UALBIO 2019/014).  2.4. Data Analysis In this study, the statistical program SPSS 25 was used to perform different analyses (e.g., mean, standard deviation, bivariate correlations, and reliability). In addition, the statistical program AMOS 20 was used to create a structural equation model (structural equation model (SEM)).",1bb52828-1d9c-48f6-a396-8933c1a34b5b
5,methods5,"  With the purpose of analyzing the hypothetical model (Figure 1), the bootstrapping procedure was used, together with the maximum likelihood method. The estimators were considered robust despite the lack of normality. To judge the model tested, several adjustment rates were examined: values of χ2/df lower than 3, comparative fit index (comparative fit index (CFI)) and incremental fit index (incremental fit index (IFI)) values close to or higher than 0.95, and root mean square error of approximation (root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)) and standardized root mean square residual (square residual (SRMR)) values lower than or very close to 0.06 and 0.08, respectively [47], were considered indicative of the adequate fit of the model. However, for complex models these adjustment fit rates should be interpreted with care as it is very restrictive [48].  3. Results 3.1.",8e5b621f-36f8-4212-a833-d60b2429aec9

As for the correlation analyses, these reflected a positive correlation between autonomy support, self determination index (SDI), resilience, adoption of the Mediterranean diet, and physical activity practice, as well as negative correlations regarding psychological controlling, frustration of competition, relatedness, autonomy, novelty, and adoption of the Mediterranean diet.  3.2.",7f456d2b-761a-4a3e-b93b-bc40d0f39edd
7,methods7," Structural Equations Model Due to the complexity of the hypothesized model (Figure 1), the number of indicators was reduced to at least two, in order to be able to analyze the relationships between the study variables [49]. In particular, the latent variables considered were resilience, which included two indicators (personal competence and acceptance of self and context) [39]; autonomy support, divided into the 12 items of the scale using two indicators, including the seven items of psychological control, the four items of frustration of competence, relatedness, autonomy, and novelty, all in order to identify the model [49].  The hypothesized predictive relationships model (Figure 1) showed that the adjustment indices were satisfactory: χ2 (106, N = 1941) = 241.52, χ2/df = 2.28, p < 0.001, incremental fit index (IFI) = 0.95, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.95, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.053 (Confidence interval 90% = 0.049–0.058), square residual (SRMR) = 0.",5ff6a768-0b72-42f8-86ab-38c6042627c6
8,methods8,"048. These results were adjusted to the established parameters, so the proposed model was accepted as adequate. In addition, the contribution of each of the factors to the prediction of other variables was examined through standardized regression weights.  4. Discussions This study has attempted to analyze the way in which the interpersonal style of the teacher (autonomy support versus psychological controlling) influences the thwarting of psychological needs, resilience, autonomous motivation, and behaviors related to the adoption of balanced eating habits, which are typical of the Mediterranean diet, and the practice of physical activity.  This study examines for the first time the dual role of the teacher in each of the factors belonging to the thwarting of psychological needs, with special emphasis on the novelty factor as it is a psychological need of recent incorporation.",9cf1fd1c-a5b7-49b6-91ec-b1fb20f80567
9,methods9," In this sense, the studies that have analyzed the influence of the teacher based on the psychological needs of students have focused only on the bright side, that is, on the influence of autonomy support on the satisfaction of psychological needs, and the dark side is still under-represented in the literature [50,51]. On the other hand, the present study contemplates for the first time the influence of the dark side of Self determination theory (SDT), that is, psychological control and the frustration of needs, on resilience in the field of Physical Education. In this sense, analyzing the dual role of the teacher is relevant given the influence it has on the social, emotional, and psychological development of students [52].",1250acdf-d01f-4ec5-a91b-c9a7d27e0871
10,methods10," In addition, it is important to highlight the influence that teachers have on students’ development of skills and knowledge based on a balance between discovery and previous experiences, which allows them to overcome difficulties and make the best decisions related to the adoption of behaviors that promote health [53,54]. In addition, PE is a discipline where students are exposed to continuous stressful situations and where, through the different proposed activities, they feel continually challenged, so success and failure are often present during classes [55,56,57]. Such circumstances can influence the opinion they have of PE classes, assuming a greater or lesser involvement of students during PE classes, affecting in the final stage the development of behaviors aimed at the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits.",b6e60b0f-77a9-4afd-aab9-2102b2837ff4
11,methods11,"  The results of the present study showed how psychological control positively predicted the thwarting of the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, relatedness, and novelty; on the contrary, autonomy support negatively predicted each of the thwarting frustrations. These results cannot be compared with similar studies because we have no evidence of research that has analyzed this relationship in the context of physical education, especially in relation to the thwarting of novelty. However, there is evidence from studies that have analyzed the influence of autonomy support on the satisfaction of psychological needs, and in recent years, on novelty. A study with high school students conducted by Zhang, Solmon, Kosma, Carson, and Gu [58] showed that those students who had high levels of support for their autonomy were positively related to each of the factors of satisfaction of psychological needs, except novelty.",d4046fc2-0056-41ed-a13c-00ed148abbc5
12,methods12," However, a recent study by González-Cutre, Romero-Elías, Jiménez-Loaisa, Beltrán-Carrillo, and Hagger [59] showed how support for autonomy was positively related to each of the factors of psychological needs, including novelty. Similarly, different studies in the field of PE (i.e., [60,61,62,63]) have shown how support for autonomy predicted the thwarting of psychological needs in a negative way; on the contrary, psychological control predicted them in a positive way, but the thwarting of psychological needs was analyzed in a global way and not through the factors that compose it. Thus, the results of the present study are in line with the results shown in previous studies and within the postulates of Self determination theory (SDT).",7e3c9e63-dcdc-4e2f-85c6-39b152aaea93
13,methods13," The results on the dual role of the teacher and the frustrations of the psychological needs established in this study can be explained by the fact that if students feel coerced, rejected, and limited in their decision-making, they will feel frustrated in their perceived autonomy and competence, in their psychological well-being, and in their psychological needs.  The results also show that frustration of the four psychological needs of competence, autonomy, relatedness, and novelty negatively predicts resilience. These results are similar to those of various studies in the field of sports, where the negative effect of the frustration of psychological needs in relation to resilience has been observed, in contrast to the positive influence of satisfaction [64,65]. However, there is little evidence of research that has analyzed the influence of the four factors of frustration of psychological needs on student resilience in the context of PE.",fe9107dd-3b25-4433-a7ac-c618af508e0c
14,methods14," In this sense, the present study shows the importance of creating a climate where students feel their psychological needs are satisfied, in order to promote the adaptability of the students to the multiple vicissitudes that present themselves while participating in the different PE classes. To this end, it is essential that teachers try to instill in their students personal skills, social competence, autonomy, optimism, and hope [66].  Finally, the results revealed that resilience positively predicted autonomous motivation. However, studies on resilience in the field of PE classes are scarce, and there is little evidence of studies that have analyzed this relationship.",38e03acf-664a-424a-8068-cc6a38cabcc5
15,methods15," Despite this situation, there are some studies in the university setting [67] that have analyzed the influence of resilience on autonomous motivation that indicated that those students who are psychologically resistant (resilient) use internal coping strategies that lead them to perceive, access, and precisely regulate their behaviors in order to achieve their objectives (autonomous motivation). Furthermore, in the sporting context, there are several studies that have explored this relationship. A study carried out by Sarkar and Fletcher [27] with semiprofessional athletes showed that those who had high levels of resilience showed a higher predisposition towards exercise merely for improving their own capacities and abilities through the overcoming of challenges. In addition, the present study has shown how autonomous motivation towards PE classes acted as a predictor of the adoption of a Mediterranean diet and regular physical activity.",08ffac35-1cfe-436e-895f-88e56e04bf38
16,methods16," Although no studies have previously analyzed the relationship between motivation and the Mediterranean diet, a study by Jiménez, Cervelló, García, Santos, and Iglesias [68] with adolescents showed that those who actively participated in Physical Education classes were more predisposed to physical activity and a healthy, balanced diet. In such a way, the results of this work suggest that if physical education classes facilitate the adaptability and motivation of the students, they will feel more predisposed towards the assimilation of contents, abilities, and attitudes that focus on the carrying out of physical activity and maintaining a healthy and balanced diet typical of the Mediterranean [69].  There are several limitations to this study that must be highlighted. First, it is based primarily on self-reported measures.",a57dae72-05ef-42b7-86f8-c6b83f380a7f
17,methods17," Secondly, it is a relational study that does not allow for the extrapolation of cause‒effect relationships, so that the results obtained can be interpreted in different ways, based on the individual’s viewpoint. On the other hand, future studies should analyze the influence of the social context on the resilience levels of students as well as on well-eating habits and regular practice of physical activity, given that it is a time of multiple changes for adolescents.  5. Conclusions The results of the present study are in line with the theoretical postulates referring to the dark side of the Self determination theory (SDT), demonstrating the importance and influence of the context of PE classes in the adoption of a Mediterranean diet and the regular practice of physical activity. In order to do so, teachers must create educational programs that focus on the achievement of basic objectives in the area of PE, based on positive experiences focused on the resolution of complex motor skills.",30664957-1894-44bb-a625-bfe982c2c5dc
