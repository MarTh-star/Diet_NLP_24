0,methods0," Study design and inclusion criteria  This is a cross-sectional study of a Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) elderly population that includes participants of both sexes to promote a lifestyle modification (with MedDiet and PA) during a total period of 12 months. Inclusion criteria were men and women aged ≥65 years with obesity (BMI ≥30-<40 kg/m2) and 1 or none of the following 4 cardio-metabolic disorders: systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg; triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL; HDL-C <40mg/dL in men and <50mg/dL women; and fasting blood glucose ≥100mg/dL, following the World Health Organization (WHO) criterion of Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO).",296ee1de-b720-455e-95ec-00e1ed4b1d8a
1,methods1," Patients were excluded from the study if they had more than one criteria of metabolic disorders or one of the following diseases: diabetes, hypertension, previous cardiovascular disease (coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral; aortic aneurysm, heart failure); severe associated disease (advanced organ failure, dementia, cancer); immobilized or terminally ill individuals; alcoholism or drug addiction; severe psychiatric illness; weight loss ≥5 kg of unknown cause in the last 6 months.  Procedure  The recruitment period was from November 2018 to March 2020. It was carried out via visits performed to centers for the healthy elderly belonging to the Sports Area (Sport Medicine) of Malaga City Hall (Andalusia, Spain). Once the possible participants were selected, they were contacted and informed about the study design and objectives and summoned to the Department of Internal Medicine in the Regional University Hospital of Malaga.",54d3e781-6d08-453c-868a-16a3f45bfaec
2,methods2," All participants in the study gave their written informed consent and protocols were approved by the institutional ethics committee (Comité de Ética de la Investigación Provincial de Malaga (ref: PI18/00766-260718), belonging to the Andalusian Health Service). This study is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN)) with ID International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN)11769612. https://www.isrctn.com/ International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN)11769612. Registration date: 29 November 2021.  Intervention  After having evaluated eating behaviors, participants were encouraged to carry out lifestyle modifications to promote a healthy diet, as well as daily aged-adapted PA, which was recommended following the internationally-accepted PA guidelines [14].",c4f577f5-5b93-4afc-97f9-0f6fe8986856
3,methods3,"  The MedDiet recommended to the participants included extra virgin olive oil and nut consumption. The recommended caloric intake was 1500–1750 kcal/day, distributed as follows: 30% of fats (5–8% of saturated fatty acids, 15–18% of monounsaturated fatty acids, 5–8% of polyunsaturated fatty acids and <300 mg of cholesterol/day), 55% of carbohydrates (<10% of simple sugars, 40% complex sugars and low glycemic index), and 15% of proteins [15].  Visits  The subjects who participated in the study had a visit at the beginning of the study and after 12 months of intervention. Anthropometric measurement (weight, height, BMI, waist circumference, and blood pressure), lifestyle questionnaires and blood samples extractions were obtained by trained sanitary personnel in both visits. Food intake questionnaires and PA measured by acelerometry were also included in order to analyze impact of the the lifestyle intervention.",21987b7c-97e5-4204-a02f-73ad02865668
4,methods4,"  Assays  Anthropometric parameters were measured by trained nurses according to the protocol. Weight was measured using an electronic scale (TANITA Body Composition Analyzer. Type TBF-300 MA. TANITA Corporation; 1-14-2 Maeno-cho, Itabashi-ku. Tokio, Japan). Height was measured with no shoes using a wall stadiometer (Stadiometer Barys Electra Model. 511-300-A0A. ASIMED). BMI (kg/m2) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. The waist/hip index (waist/hip index (WHI)) was calculated as the ratio of abdominal circumference (at the level of the mid-point between the anterosuperior iliac crest and the last costal arch, parallel to the ground and upon exhalation) and hip, both in cm. Systolic blood pressure (Systolic blood pressure (SBP)) and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) were calculated as the mean of three measurements after a 5-minute rest and measured using an automated electronic sphygmomanometer (OMRON M7; HEM-780-E).",1d2c2845-3736-4741-a5fb-e6b017f69268
5,methods5,"  Food intake was analyzed using questionnaires. A non-consecutive, 3-days dietary record (two workdays and one weekend day), containing detailed information about food composition and cooking recipes over 72 hours [16] and a food frequency questionnaire (number of times/day, number of days/week, number of days/14 days, number of days/month, rarely, or never) were completed in every visit [17]. Adherence to MedDiet was assessed by a validated 14-item food consumption frequency questionnaire, according to Trichopoulou A et al. [10]. 12–14 points was considered high MedDiet adherence, 8–11 points was considered moderate adherence, 5–7 points was considered low adherence, and <5 points was considered very low adherence.  PA was also monitored. Subjects were given GENEActiv Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers to collect several data. The accelerometer should be worn under the chest with a tight elastic belt to ensure close contact with the body.",baf8d08c-d144-436a-a08c-b1912c4f15ec
6,methods6," Recordings were made every day for at least 7 days (weekdays and the weekend) to assess their hours of PA and sleep, except during water activities.  Blood samples were taken after an overnight fast. Besides, blood samples were processed to obtain blood serum, which was aliquoted and stored at -80°C until its use. Biochemical levels (inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines profile) were measured in the Biomedical Research Laboratory of Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Málaga (Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Malaga (IBIMA)). Serum inflammatory biomarker levels (IL-6 and TNFa) and adipokines were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). For IL-6 levels, the minimum detectable concentration was 0.70 pg/mL. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 2.6% and 4.5%, respectively. The minimum detectable concentration of TNFa levels, was 1.6 pg/mL.",ed4405a4-54cd-43a2-8dce-56297c2afc54
7,methods7," The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 4.7% and 5.8%, respectively. For adiponectin levels, the minimum detectable concentration was 0.246 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 3.5% and 6.5%, respectively. For resistin levels, the minimum detectable concentration was 0.026 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 4.7% and 8.4%, respectively. Lastly, high-ultrasensitivity C reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (DRG Instruments GmbH, Germany). The minimum detectable concentration was 0.1 mg/mL. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 4.4% and 3.3%, respectively. ",a130e594-5526-41a8-aaff-e68933792135
8,analysis0," Simple Interactive Statistical Analysis (Simple Interactive Statistical Analysis (SISA)) was used to calculate the sample size. We assumed a 95% confidence level (0.5% error), a statistical power of 80%, and a loss rate of 5%. To detect differences in the inflammatory and adipokines profile, the sample size needed was 150 patients. Quantitative variables with normal distribution were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and qualitative variables were expressed as percentages. Student t-test to compare quantitative variables and the Chi-square test to compare qualitative variables were used. Bivariate correlations were determined using Pearson correlation coefficient. The SPSS program, version 22.0 for Windows (IBM Corporation INC. Somers, NY, USA) was used for the statistical analysis of results. ",97259923-bf34-4de3-add7-4e30b8d84854
9,results0," The initial recruitment from centers for the elderly included a total of 690 subjects who wanted to participate in the study. From these individuals, 524 did not meet the inclusion criteria or finally declined to participate. The final sample included 166 Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) elderly subjects (Fig 1).  10.1371/journal.pone.0265362.g001 Fig 1 Flow chart diagram of the selection patients in our analysis.  From these 166 subjects, 40 (24.1%) were male and 126 (75.9%) female (p <0.0001), with an average age of 71.7±5.2 years (65 to 87 years old).  The anthropometric and clinical parameters, as well as MedDiet adherence at the initial visit and after 12 months of lifestyle modification, are shown in Table 1. After 12 months of intervention, the weight and BMI of our subjects remained similar with respect to baseline. However, their waist circumference decreased significantly in both male and female population (-2.6 cm for male and -3.7 cm for female after 12 months, p<0.",b872bc9f-00d1-412b-87fc-bde35664cd5c
10,results5," After 12 months of intervention, C reactive protein (CRP) was positively associated with weight (r = 0.25, p = 0.01) and BMI (r = 0.31, p = 0.01), and negatively associated with waist/hip index (WHI) (r = -0.23, p = 0.02) were observed. Waist circumference (r = 0.22, p = 0.02), and moderate (r = -0.20, p = 0.04) and moderate-vigorous PA (r = -0.21, p = 0.03) correlate with IL-6 levels. In addition, TNFa only correlates negatively with weight (r = -0.19, p = 0.05). On the other hand, adiponectin concentration had a positive correlation (r = 0.24, p = 0.01) with waist/hip index (WHI). Resistin levels positively correlate with weight (r = 0.22, p = 0.02) and waist circumference (r = 0.23, p = 0.02).  10.1371/journal.pone.0265362.t004 Table 4 Pearson correlation coefficient: Inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines vs. anthropometric parameters, Mediterranean diet adherence, and physical activity intensity levels at baseline and after 12 months of intervention.",f93d98a8-a9f3-4c0e-8513-5921bb4941d2
11,results8,"  In baseline conditions, resistin levels correlate positively with TNFa (r = 0.25, p = 0.01) and C reactive protein (CRP) (r = 0.31, p<0.0001) levels. TNFa and IL-6 correlates positively with C reactive protein (CRP) (r = 0.19, p = 0.03 and r = 0.36, p<0.0001, respectively). After 12 months of intervention, only IL-6 correlates positively with C reactive protein (CRP) (r = 0.26, p = 0.006). Data indicate that adipokines levels correlate positively during the process of lifestyle modification (adiponectine: basal vs 12 months, r = 0.75, p<0.0001 and resistin: basal vs 12 months, r = 0.74, p<0.0001). However, during this process of lifestyle modification, only IL-6 correlated positively with itself (basal vs 12 months, r = 0.46, p<0.0001) and with C reactive protein (CRP) (Il-6 basal vs C reactive protein (CRP) 12 months, r = 0.25, p = 0.03).

12,discussion0," This study was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic situation. In this context, our Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) elderly population had to experience a strict and extensive lockdown. Their practice of PA obviously decreased due to the epidemiologic circumstances. Older adults are more vulnerable to COVID-19 [18], as health authorities, politicians, and social media have widely reported. Besides the restrictions, the infection fear has decreased PA in older people [19] and it has also affected our study results. Moreover, dietary habits have changed during lockdown in many people, with a higher frequency of food, snacking, and alcoholic drinks consumption [20]. This trend towards unhealthy food habits during lockdown, along with a decreased PA due to mobility restrictions, has led to weight gain in many cases, especially in already people with obesity [21].",32069eb0-812b-49cb-ae85-b71824ec70f4
13,discussion1," Despite this scenario, our Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) elderly participants maintained their healthy lifestyle, even increasing their adherence to MedDiet so that their weight and BMI remained similar to the baseline values.  It is noted that the female gender is the main group in our study. Women are reported to participate more in this type of health improvement studies, which leads to a longer life expectancy than men. In elderly ages, the survival of women (with a mean life of 87 years old) is more frequent compared to men (with a life expectancy of 83.6 years old) in our environment (Málaga, Spain) [22]. Women are more concerned about the importance of healthy habits in order to prevent metabolic diseases.",288eacdc-dd15-4c66-a30b-cecbe8e8b0d6
14,discussion2,"  Previous studies have demonstrated that participants who underwent an intensive lifestyle modification, with weight control and practice of PA, improved their levels of adipokines and cytokines, not only during the intervention period, but these changes persisted for 12 months post-intervention [23]. Inflammatory profile in our Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) elderly subjects was in normal range both in baseline conditions and after 12 months of lifestyle modification. C reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 decreased after intervention, data in concordance with Gokulakrishnan K et al. [23]. C reactive protein (CRP) is a pentameric protein with hepatic origin related to inflammation process and obesity. It is demonstrated that C reactive protein (CRP) is associated with BMI [24]. When the inflammation cascade is activated, T cells and macrophages secrete another inflammatory biomarker, IL-6.",628cd499-f640-4a59-8574-6de353a8061b
15,discussion3," It is known that IL-6 levels increase with adiposity, and that 15–25% of circulating IL-6 might be released by adipose tissue in vivo [25]. Although both IL-6 and TNFa are expressed by adipose tissue, there are important differences in their systemic release. IL-6 is released from subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, TNFa is not released by this type of adipose tissue. Although our Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) elderly population had a very low weight loss, our results showed significantly decreased levels of inflammatory markers (C reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6) after intervention. Other studies have suggested that lifestyle modifications following a healthy diet and regular practice of PA decrease plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines as IL-6 and TNFa [26]. However, TNFa concentrations experience a significant increment, although their values are in normal range after 12 months of intervention, perhaps due to the advanced age of our population.",7a5e6341-d0a9-4e8b-974a-f895236a0b33
16,discussion4," In elderly population, sarcopenic/cachectic obesity can occur, with a permanent loss of skeletal muscle mass (sarcopenia), with or without loss of fat mass [27]. This is the case of some patients with chronic inflammatory diseases of the joints, in whom the effect of the increased metabolism induced by activation of immune response [28] is compensated with minor practice of PA. He J. et al. demonstrated that TNFa expression in adipose tissue is positively associated with 24-h energy expenditure [29]. These data are in agreement with our results, in which TNFa is increased when our elderly Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) participants reduced their practice of PA in all their levels (moderate or vigorous PA). Regarding correlation between inflammation biomarkers and PA, only TNFa correlated with PA in baseline conditions. It showed negative correlation with moderate, moderate to vigorous and vigorous PA.",d9a5bd11-77e0-4339-a18d-a1532ab21c43
17,discussion5," As it has been demonstrated by other authors, TNFa tends to decrease with PA, but especially with PA of moderate intensity [30]. Our subjects had a high level of moderate and moderate to vigorous PA at baseline, but after 12 months of intervention, there was no correlation between PA and TNFa as PA drastically decreased due to COVID-19 restrictions.  Our population presented a normal range of adipokine profile (adiponectin and resistin) in pre and post intervention conditions. High concentrations of adiponectin are associated with a higher adherence to the MedDiet in adult population [31]. This fact has been corroborated in our study, despite the fact that there is a lack of a statistically-significant correlation. MedDiet with weight loss significantly increased plasma adiponectin levels [32]. Adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ. The adipocytes secrete multiple, metabolically active proteins, adipokines.",f64e8b58-7e29-4393-919c-09cd3c46cf07
18,discussion6," Adiponectin is secreted by adipocytes, and paradoxically, its levels are decreased in subjects with obesity [33]. Adiponectin is mostly expressed in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Its expression and blood concentration decrease as adiposity increases and low levels of adiponectin are associated with disease states such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our elderly population increased significantly their levels of adiponectin despite their BMI being maintained. However, another adipokine, resistin, decreases significantly and correlates positively with weight and abdominal circumference in our elderly Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) population. Resistin is an adipokine linked to obesity and diabetes and involved in the development of insulin resistance. Normally, the serum concentration of resistin in humans ranges from 7 to 22 ng/mL.",7677ce2f-ab8e-47f1-bdcd-3e00629cc249
19,discussion7," Resistin activates the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and cytokines as IL-6 and TNFa, through activation of transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [34]. In studies of subjects with obesity, high resistin concentrations correlate with weight and BMI [35]. Diet and PA decrease resistin levels, which is typically accompanied by a reduction in BMI [36], in concordance with data found in this study. On the other side, high-intensity PA induced an improvement in inflammatory biomarkers and insulin resistance, with a reduction in IL-6, TNFa, C reactive protein (CRP), and resistin and an increase in adiponectin, thus indicating that exercise exerts anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitising effects [37]. These data are in concordance with the data reported in this study.",bd6ce060-b679-4fdb-974c-43d3cb7432f6
20,discussion8,"  Limitations  An important limitation in this study could be the lack of a control group, but it is important that each participant was aware of his/her progression and improvement of his/her life quality when they follow a healthy lifestyle. For this reason, a comparison of inflammatory and adipokine profile in baseline conditions and after 12-month lifestyle intervention could note the efficacy of intervention.  Other limitations of our study are, firstly, the difference between the number of male and female participants. It has been demonstrated than women are more participative in lifestyle modification studies than male subjects, as they are usually more concerned about health care. And secondly, our study was performed on a Caucasian population sample, and therefore it cannot be extrapolated to other ethnic groups.  Conclusions  In conclusion, aging is a complex and multifactorial biological process with an increased prevalence of metabolic abnormalities such as obesity.",7fbc0832-105c-484b-ab70-e45b7a9436d6
21,discussion9," Adipocytes modulate the activity of pre-adipocytes, endothelial cells, and monocytes/macrophages due to increased production of inflammatory cytokines (C reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, TNFa) and adipokines (adiponectin, resistin) among others. In addition, age-related body composition changes could play a role in the expression of inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines. As this study demonstrated a personalized MedDiet and PA program could modify and improve this process.  Supporting information  S1 Protocol (DOCX)  Click here for additional data file.

33,discussion21," (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)  Reviewer #1: In this paper, the authors aimed to examine the impact of lifestyle modifications by following a Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) program and physical activity (PA) training on inflammatory biomarkers and adipokine profile in a Metabolically Healthy Obese (Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO)) elderly population. 166 Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) elderly subjects including 40 males and 126 females were included. They observed that 12 months of intervention reduced the waist circumference but did not change body weight and BMI. MedDiet adherence increased, but all intensity levels of PA decreased. While C reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 tended to be reduced, TNFa was increased after 12 months, when adiponectin level was also elevated and resistin concentrations decreased.",553449e7-9c01-49b7-b6dd-e8daf2219619
34,discussion22," TNFa, adiponectin, and resistin correlated with PA at baseline and after 12 months and C reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, TNFa, adiponectin, and resistin concentrations correlated with anthropometric parameters and some intensities of PA. At baseline, resistin levels correlated positively with TNFa and C reactive protein (CRP) levels. TNFa and IL-6 correlated positively with C reactive protein (CRP). After 12 months, only IL-6 correlated positively with C reactive protein (CRP).  This paper reported some interesting correlations as analyzed and presented from a small cohort of elderly Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) subjects, and was generally well written, but provided limited novel information. The main issue is that without a control group, how the authors can tell the changes at 12 months were because of interventions rather than a natural aging process. The significance of the correlations is unknown.",f49c2bcf-bad8-4343-a39c-a079460949ea
35,discussion23," While correlations of the markers with some anthropometric parameters and PA intensities were analyzed, their relations to metabolic parameters such as glucose, insulin, and lipid levels were not analyzed. Also, the conclusion of the study was not clearly stated.  Reviewer #2: The authors of this study explored the phenotype of metabolically healthy obesity. Multiple biomarkers of obesity and inflammation were assessed in response to lifestyle modifications. In my opinion, the authors do not use appropriate statistical methods in the study (e.g, Student t-test, assessments of normal distributions). A revision must include justification of statistical tests and apply post-hoc testing.  **********  6.
