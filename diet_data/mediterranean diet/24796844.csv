0,introduction0,"The implication of low-grade, chronic inflammation in the formation, progression and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques is now well-recognized [1]. Accordingly, elevated C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)), a marker reflecting the individual’s systemic inflammatory status, has been consistently associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease events [2, 3] and type 2 diabetes [4]. There is growing evidence that adopting the traditional Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) reduces systemic inflammation [5]. The MedDiet is characterized by an abundance of plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, nuts and legumes; olive oil as the main source of fat; moderate amounts of fish, poultry, dairy products and eggs; relatively low amounts of red meat and sweets and moderate amounts of red wine with meals [6].",2ed0d08d-e5b5-4c75-bf39-15e24abaf353
1,introduction1," However, even if most of the intervention trials have reported that this food pattern reduces C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations [7–11], some have observed no effects [12–15]. Accordingly, the investigation of factors that may influence the anti-inflammatory effects of this healthy food pattern is of great interest. Sex has been highlighted as a determinant of the inflammatory regulation. In fact women are characterized by a higher inflammatory overall burden than men [16]. Also, effects of sex hormones on inflammatory status have been documented, estrogens being now recognized for their anti-inflammatory properties in women [17]. However it is still not known whether MedDiet exerts the same effect on inflammation in men and women. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate sex differences in the effects of the MedDiet on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-C reactive protein (CRP)) concentrations.",c5371e2a-f890-4255-a4d7-0965cc466d29
2,introduction2," As estrogens have anti-inflammatory properties in premenopausal women [17], and that the MedDiet has been previously shown to reduce estrogen concentrations in women [18], we hypothesized that premenopausal women benefit less from the anti-inflammatory effects of the MedDiet than men.

3,methods0,"Participants Thirty-eight men and 32 premenopausal women (24–53 years) took part of this study.

4,methods1," Power analysis indicated that a total sample size of n = 62 is sufficient to detect significant changes in hs-C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations (repeated measures, within-between interaction) with a small effect-size estimate (Cohen’s d of 0.20), and with an α = 0.05 and a power (1-β error probability) of 0.95 (G*Power Version 3.0.10, Franz Faul, Universität Kiel, Germany).  Study design The study protocol consisted in a 4-week run-in period, immediately followed by a 4-week fully-controlled MedDiet phase. Firstly, during the 4-week run-in period, participants had to comply with the recommendations of the Canada’s Food Guide [20] as prescribed by a registered dietician. The purpose of this run-in period was to ensure similar dietary habits between men and women prior the controlled MedDiet phase, a goal that has been reached as previously reported [19].",1f3c41a8-1ecf-428f-8c2e-95e827f5ec17
5,methods2," Briefly, Canada’s Food Guide is an educational tool which promotes healthy eating for Canadians in order to reduce the risk of many chronic diseases and to achieve overall health and vitality. It indicates the recommended number of food guide servings per day for each of the four food groups (vegetables and fruits, grain products, milk and alternatives, and meat and alternatives) according to the age and sex of individuals.  Thereafter, during a 4-week fully-controlled feeding phase, subjects consumed an experimental MedDiet formulated to be concordant with the characteristics of the traditional MedDiet [6]. Details about the composition of the MedDiet are given in Table 1 and Table 2, as previously reported in other publications [19, 21]. Subjects were instructed to consume only the foods and beverages provided to them, which corresponded to 100 % of their estimated energy needs.",199be772-fc79-4c13-980e-6fd5c4e57fbc
6,methods3," More precisely, energy needs were estimated by averaging the energy requirements estimated by a validated FFQ [22] administrated at the beginning of the run-in period and energy needs as determined by the Harris–Benedict formula. Body weight was measured on weekdays just before lunch and in case of body weight variation, energy intake was modified. The amount of each food/drink provided to each participant during the MedDiet was proportional to his/her estimated energy needs. In order to evaluate compliance, participants were asked to note on a checklist foods consumed and, if needed, the amount of foods not consumed for each day of the controlled MedDiet phase. The overall compliance calculated from the food checklist in men and women was respectively 97.9 ± 3.6 % and 97.6 ± 3.2 %.",eabee772-2a31-4ede-9414-f8eac96e3630

In fact, in this sample of individuals characterized by moderately elevated C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, no beneficial effects from the MedDiet were observed, irrespective of the sex. However, results suggest that the variability in the anti-inflammatory effects of the MedDiet might be attributed in part to the individual’s overall inflammatory status but this observation seems to be more specific to men.  Despite the fact that men and women differ substantially with respect to inflammatory regulation, very limited data exist on sex differences in the impact of diet on inflammatory status.",e4347be9-6b46-4463-90fd-91eda63c4f2b
16,discussion1," In the case of the MedDiet, an observational study has reported reduced C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in men, but not in women, who consumed a diet more closely in accordance with the MedDiet [27] while another study observed this association irrespective of the sex [28]. For interventional trials, only the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED)) study has previously documented the effects of the MedDiet on inflammatory status taking into account the sex [11]. Their study, consisting of a nutritional intervention among 772 high-risk individuals, indicates that the adherence to an energy-unrestricted MedDiet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil reduces C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations compared with a low-fat diet, with subgroup analyses showing no difference between sexes.",a305c300-7093-425f-b90b-198356f7884d
17,discussion2," Results from our feeding study are therefore partly in line with those from the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) study, suggesting that the MedDiet has similar effect on inflammation in men and women.  However, our results are in disagreement with a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in 2014 [5] which, as the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) study, reported a reduction of C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations with the MedDiet. However, further investigations of trials included in the meta-analysis highlight conflicting results between studies, some reporting a reduction of systemic inflammation with the MedDiet while almost half of the studies observed no significant effects.",0258e31e-c9bd-4a5e-be1c-950cbe4fdf0a
18,discussion3," In an effort to improve our understanding of factors responsible for this divergence between studies, additional analyses from the present study suggest that the variability in the inflammatory response to the MedDiet might be attributed in part to the individual’s systemic inflammatory status, i.e. those with elevated C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations having anti-inflammatory effects from the MedDiet while those with low baseline concentrations experiencing a clinically non-significant increase in response to this food pattern. However this pattern of change was more specific to men, suggesting that sex may modulate to a certain extent the impact of the MedDiet on the inflammatory status.  It is important to consider that participants included in the present study were characterized by healthy dietary habits at baseline. In fact, participants had to comply with the recommendations of the Canada’s Food Guide during the four weeks preceding the controlled MedDiet phase [19].",57ec62f4-e9e8-4993-bc06-8d08758becc0
19,discussion4," It is therefore possible that changes in hs-C reactive protein (CRP) have started during this run-in phase, limiting subsequent changes during the controlled MedDiet phase. Therefore, results from the present study should not be over-interpreted and they suggest that, compared with the Canada’s Food Guide recommendations, the MedDiet has no further impact on hs-C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations.  The small body weight loss observed during the MedDiet phase may be view as a limitation. However, several studies have demonstrated that body weight loss is the best nonpharmacologic modality to reduce inflammation [29], which is in contrast with the nonsingnificant increase in hs-C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations observed in the present study. In addition, some studies have highlighted that a weight loss of at least 10 % is needed to have a significant effect on the inflammatory markers in overweight and obese individuals [30].",44435637-124e-4a02-8d11-2fc3d2e46576
20,discussion5," Moreover, additional analyses showed that the adjustment for body weight changes did not influence any of the results obtained. Therefore, these observations suggest that body weight loss observed in the present study was not a major limitation.  Conclusions Results from this feeding study suggest that the MedDiet exerts similar effects on inflammation in men and women. In addition, these results suggest that the variability in the anti-inflammatory effects of the MedDiet might be attributed in part to the individual’s overall inflammatory status; however this observation seems to be more specific to men. Additional clinical studies including several inflammatory markers and a larger sample size are of importance to further document the impact of sex on the inflammatory response to the MedDiet.",16931a86-f9e1-4902-96d8-dfb74b3c8369
