SYBR Green assay  The effect of apigenin on the proliferation of prostate cancer cells were assessed by SYBR Green assay. LNCaP (2000 cells/well) and PC-3 (12,000 cells/well) cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured overnight. On the following day, the culture medium was gently removed, and the cells were treated with apigenin at different concentrations (0 to 50 µM) in fresh medium. The spare plates of cells were used for baseline measurement of DNA content immediately prior to treatment for the purpose of calculating the net change in DNA content over the experimental period and stored at -80◦C. Seventy-two hours (72 h) after treatment, the medium was gently aspirated and 100 µL of lysis buffer containing SYBR Green I (S-7563, Invitrogen) at 1:10,000 dilution was added. The lysis buffer was made up of 9 portions of buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.",f61add04-3865-4ea5-b3ad-dbd20ebaa993

The frozen cells used for baseline control were thawed at room temperature, lyzed in the same manner and transferred to the unused wells of treatment plate. The fluorescence intensity of SYBR Green-labeled DNA was measured using a plate reader (FLUOstar Omega, BMG Labtech) with excitation at 485/20 nm and emission at 528/20 nm as previously described [30, 31]. The growth inhibition (GI) is calculated using the formula: [(FI of control − FI of baseline) − (FI of treated − FI of baseline)]/(FI of control − FI of baseline) × 100%. FI is fluorescence intensity from SYBR green [32].  Flow cytometric analysis  Propidium iodide (PI) staining was used to analyze cell cycle phase distribution.

Cells were harvested and stained with PI as described previously [30, 31]. To differentiate cells at G2 phase that contain 4n DNA content but are negative for phospho-Histone H3 from mitotic cells that also hold 4n DNA content but are positive for phospho-Histone H3 [33], the harvested cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. Thereafter, the cells were sequentially labeled with antibody to phospho-Histone H3 (9701, Cell Signaling Technology) and a secondary antibody conjugated with AlexaFluor488 (A11008, Life Technology) diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA in the presence of 0.1% saponin prior to PI staining. As a reference, the cancer cells were treated with nocodazole at 0.8 µg/mL for 16 h to enrich cells at M phase and then subjected to the same labeling procedure.",4672dc2f-5135-41d5-ac1a-d305675fe474

Flow cytometric data on the labeled cells were then acquired by using a flow cytometer (FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences) and analyzed by using FlowJo software [28].  Immunoblotting  LNCaP and PC-3 cells were treated in T25 flasks at different doses (0 to 25 µM) of apigenin for 72 h and cell lysates were prepared with RIPA-buffer (R0278, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (11,836,145,001; Roche) as described previously [30, 31]. Cells in the lysis buffer were sonicated in 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes on ice. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000g for 1 min and resultant supernatants were collected and stored at -80 °C until use. To detect proteins of interest, proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to Polyvinylidene fluoride (Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)) membranes (ISEQ00010, Immobilon).",0ad66a4d-22b2-4fb2-83df-301a3087055e

Compared with vehicle control, apigenin increased the cancer cells at G2/M phase in a dose dependent fashion (Fig. 2). To determine whether apigenin arrested the cancer cells at G2 or M phase, the cancer cells were treated for 72 h and then co-stained with an antibody to phospho-Histone H3 at Ser10 (a mitotic marker) and PI for further flow cytometric analysis.

Apigenin reduced CyclinB1, PLK1 and Aurora A in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells at both protein (Fig. 4) and mRNA (Fig. 5) levels. In addition, both protein and mRNA levels of CDK1 were also reduced in PC-3 cells. To further dissect the mechanism underlying the findings, ChIP was performed to evaluate the levels of H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at promoter regions of these genes in PC-3 cells. Consistently, apigenin reduced the degree of this epigenetic modification (Fig. 6), reinforcing the notion that apigenin diminished gene expression of the regulators governing G2 to M transition in prostate cancer cells.

15,discussion0," Apigenin is a plant flavone and naturally occurs as a 4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavone with hydroxyl groups at positions C-5 and C-7 of the A-ring and C-4′ of the B-ring. It is abundantly present in parsley, onion, celery, basil, oregano, orange, tea, chamomile and wheat sprout [5, 6] and other vegetables [35] and fruits [36–38]. Epidemiologic studies indicate that a diet rich in flavones including apigenin is associated with a reduced risk of a variety of cancers [38].  To investigate the mode of action for apigenin, numerous laboratory studies have been conducted and most frequently apigenin has been shown to arrest a number of types of cancer cells at G2/M phase [13–15, 18, 19, 21, 25]. To our knowledge, a further cell cycle analysis to dissect action of apigenin on the cell cycle has not been attempted. We reasoned that if apigenin acts on the G2 phase, one can envisage a combination of apigenin with mitosis-targeting agents (e.g.",d3dc15e5-4f92-47ce-9b3f-6f8918626177
16,discussion1,", docetaxel, the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer through stabilizing microtubules) is more effective for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer by simultaneous inhibition of cell cycle progression at both G2 and mitotic phases. On the other hand, if apigenin affects M phase by destabilizing microtubule, it is expected to antagonize the effect of docetaxel [39, 40].  In agreement with previous reports [10, 41, 42], apigenin in our study was shown to exert its inhibitory effect on cell proliferation through G2/M arrest in prostate cancer cells. To further dissect the cell cycle arrest, the cancer cells were co-stained for phospho-Histone H3 and DNA to distinguish the cells at G2 phase from mitotic cells [28], and subsequent flow cytometric analysis of the stained cancer cells revealed that apigenin impeded progression through G2 phase instead of passage through M phase.",27996dfe-7dc0-427b-82e9-4999695a9fbd
17,discussion2," In line with our previous study [28], the underlying mechanism of the observed G2 arrest was reduced transcription of the essential regulators governing the G2-M transition, as evidenced by down-regulation of mRNAs for cyclin B1, PLK1 and Aurora A in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells. In addition, CDK1 was also down-regulated at mRNA level in PC-3 cells. Consistently, the corresponding protein levels of the regulators were also diminished. Further analysis of gene transcription activity was performed by exploiting H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at promoter regions of genes as a marker of active transcription [43, 44]. The analysis illustrated that apigenin substantially lessened the levels of H3K4me3 in the promoter regions of the genes coding for CDK1, cyclin B1, PLK1 and Aurora A, indicating repressed transcription of the corresponding genes.",896e533f-2149-4a38-bb5a-d098f3a534aa
18,discussion3," Considering a reduction of cyclin B1 and CDK1 by apigenin has been reported in other cancer cell lines [10], it is possible that the impeding effect imposed on G2-M transition by apigenin is a general mode of action in a broad range of cancer cells.  Revealing the G2 arresting action of apigenin through its inhibitory effect on the transcription of Cyclin B1, CDK1, PLK1 and Aurora A is instructive in contemplating the implication of our findings. Firstly, the mRNA levels of Cyclin B1, CDK1, PLK1 and Aurora A are significantly higher in primary localized prostate cancer than those in benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the levels of these regulators are further elevated in prostate cancer with metastasis compared with those in primary localized prostate cancer [28]. Secondly, higher expressions of these genes have been found to be associated with poor prognosis in the patients with cancer diseases [45–47].",90fd2966-520a-499f-b91d-daee3f842dba
19,discussion4," Thirdly, the inhibition of these regulators as therapeutic targets with their respective inhibitors in clinical trials has commenced [48–50]. Therefore, apigenin or apigenin-enriched food may potentially synergize mitosis-targeting agents such as docetaxel for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer by targeting both G2 and M phases. Equally important, apigenin imposes less cytotoxicity to benign human prostate epithelial cells than counterpart cancerous cells under in vitro condition [51], and it suppresses prostate cancer growth without perceivable side effects in mouse models of human prostate cancer [24, 52], suggesting it has a good safety profile. However, it is also noteworthy that apigenin has a low solubility in water [53] and a low bioavailability after oral administration [54]. Accordingly, an effort to optimize formulation of apigenin has been made [55], which should help to overcome the obstacles with regard to its potential clinical applications.",948f94f4-4be1-4878-83fc-dc48c562d052
20,discussion5,"  In conclusion, this study further dissected the action of apigenin on the cell cycle progression in prostate cancer cells and showed that apigenin causes cell cycle arrest in G2 phase by repression of transcriptional activity of the genes for the regulators governing G2-M transition.
