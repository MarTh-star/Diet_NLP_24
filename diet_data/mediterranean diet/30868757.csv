0,background0,"Missing data is a common phenomenon, especially, in questionnaire-based, population surveys or epidemiological studies. Presence of missing data reduce the representativeness of the selected sample, cause bias and lead to a decrease in the a-priori designed statistical power, as well as the efficiency and validity of the conducted analyses and therefore, distort inferences about the referent population [1, 2]. Although several methodological frameworks have been proposed to reduce missingness in data collection in quantitative surveys, this situation is, unfortunately, quite common in research. Moreover, it becomes more critical, especially when the missing data concern a multi-item, health-related instrument (or scale, score), which is applied to measure a latent construct that is difficult or impossible to measured directly [3].",55783467-d3f0-4f5d-be8f-76716613506f
1,background1," There is a variety of such instruments that has been developed to measure psychological disorders’ symptomatology (like anxiety, depression, stress) [4], dietary patterns (like Mediterranean diet) and behaviors (like Healthy Eating pattern) [5], and several clinical conditions (like risk of developing cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), diabetes, obesity) [6]. Lack of information in even one of the instruments’ items, leads to the inability to calculate the total score of the instrument, making the whole procedure useless since it would not be able to correctly classify the individual to the health class belongs.  The main sources of item’s non-response are, the type of research (e.g., topic of research, referent population), the structure of the questionnaire or the instrument, the interviewer (e.g., easy acceptance of don’t’ knows (DKs)), and the background characteristics of the respondents [7–9].",dabd8e25-050c-4771-96ef-fd01579dea29
2,background2," Identifying the profile of individuals with missing data, is of crucial importance in order for a study and its results to be valid. For instance, individuals with missing data may be systematically different from those with complete information, either regarding the outcome of interest, or their prognosis in general. Review of the source of missingness in health surveys revealed that older individuals and low educated, as well as, females and those with poorer health status, tend to have higher levels of missing information [10].  Although several methodologies have been proposed, the aforementioned topic of missing data analysis is still not well studied and understood [11]. Complete case analysis (Complete case analysis (CCA)) and proration (i.e., summing or averaging the available items with no missing data) constitute two of the most frequently used missing data handling methods [12, 13].",34c3b6e9-47ae-4004-a1e1-01e839fe5b40
3,background3," In spite of their simplicity, methodologists have raised several important concerns about their use, since they lead to underpowered results caused by a decreased sample size and they depend on missing data patterns and rates in the sample [14]. According to Rubin’s terminology, missing data patterns are classified as missing completely at random (missing completely at random (MCAR)) where the probability of missingness does not depend on either observed or missing data, missing at random (missing at random (MAR)) where conditional on the observed data, the probability of missingness is independent of unobserved data, and missing not at random (missing not at random (MNAR)), where the probability of missingness is dependent on unobserved data even after conditioning on observed data [15].",eb0b50d0-50c2-4683-ad6b-078f2993fdad

5,methods0,"Sample The working sample to test the research hypothesis of this work is the data from the ATTICA study, which is a prospective, observational cohort investigation initiated in 2001 [16]. At the baseline examination (2001–2002), n = 3042 apparently healthy volunteers (free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other chronic diseases) residing in the greater metropolitan Athens area, in Greece, agreed to participate (75% participation rate). Of the enrolled participants, n = 1514 (49.8%) were men [46 years old (SD = 13 years)] and n = 1528 (50.2%) were women [45 years old (SD = 14 years)]. During baseline examination, a detailed clinical evaluation was performed by trained physicians. For the purposes of this work, we excluded n = 848 participants with missing or incomplete demographic information and, thus the working sample consisted of n = 2194 subjects [1364 men: 64 years old (SD = 12 years) and 830 women: 66 years old (SD = 12 years)].",71e41605-f98d-469c-83dd-22b4c749153c

Further details regarding the methods and measurements applied in the ATTICA study have been previously detailed [16].  Clinical characteristics Assessment of clinical characteristics (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus) was performed according to established physical examination procedures and pharmaceutical treatment [16]. In particular, diabetes mellitus was defined as a fasting blood sugar > 125 mg/dl or the use of antidiabetic medication and, thus, participants were classified as diabetic or non- diabetic.",111261a0-7d9e-4778-9768-23f3fc9ef401
8,methods3," Patients whose average blood pressure levels that were measured by study’s investigators through standard procedure, were greater or equal to 140/ 90 mmHg or were under antihypertensive medication, were classified as having hypertension. Based on the total serum cholesterol levels measured, participants were classified in three groups (Group I: Desirable levels (< 200 mg/dL), Group II: Borderline levels (200–239 mg/dL) and Group III: High levels (> 240 mg/dL)), with those belonging in Group II and III, characterized as hypercholesterolemic.  Dietary assessment The MedDietScore, an instrument (scale) used to estimate the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, was applied to all participants [5]. This scale consists of 11 items estimating the frequency with which individuals consume several foods, which are either close to the Mediterranean diet (e.g., fruits, vegetables, non-refined cereals, and products), or away (e.g. meat and meat products).",22b243e4-fb60-4095-af1b-288a130d232b
9,methods4," Higher values of this scale indicate adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet, while lower values indicate adherence to the “Westernized” diet.  Psychological evaluation A translated and validated version of the Zung’s Self-Rating Depression Scale (Self rating Depression Scale (SDS)) was used, in order to assess the depressive symptoms of the participants. The scale consists of 20 items, covering affective, cognitive, and somatic symptoms, which estimate the frequency with which each symptom is experienced by the individual. Higher scores are indicative of more severe depression [17].  Outcomes The outcome examined in the present work was the number of missing data in the items of the two self-rating scales (i.e., MedDietScore and Zung’s Self rating Depression Scale (SDS)). Specifically, for each participant two new variables were created indicating the number of missing items in each scale.",b596aa50-c85b-4cf4-87d3-aeb064a35501

Concerning the Zung’s Self rating Depression Scale (SDS), three more variables were created indicating the number of missing items in each subscale estimating the affective, cognitive, and somatic symptoms. Furthermore, in order to examine the behavior of the different missing data handling techniques with an increasing number of missing data (in each scale), participants were further classified in 3 groups, based on the number of missing items in the total MedDietScore and Zung’s Self rating Depression Scale (SDS) scale.

Its efficiency over the complete case analysis could be attributed to the fact that MI uses information in the incomplete cases, to the fact that Complete case analysis (CCA) is valid only in the case of missing completely at random (MCAR) data [31, 32]. Multiple imputation is a general approach which is simple to understand, but hard to program.",a49ad77d-1792-4fa9-b12d-899289fb3752
38,discussion6," In addition, yields unbiased estimates and provides more validity, when compared to ad-hoc approaches. Furthermore, multiple imputation was more efficient when compared to mean imputation (at the score or the person or the item level), which is a tempting but not recommended method, as it underestimates the variance in the dataset [29]. In general, our results agree with several other empirical studies in the era of nutritional epidemiology, suggesting that more advanced imputation methods, such as the MI, should be used as they give more accurate intake estimates [33–36].  Limitations To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies investigating the profile of individuals with missing data, in such widely used instruments and to such extent. However, the conclusions of the present work should be considered under some existing limitations. First of all, the cross-sectional nature of the data does not allow for causal associations to be drawn.",baecd29f-8a51-4b28-b2fe-167e95c94973
39,discussion7," Another limitation is the fact that the true underlying value and the true regression coefficients of the missing data were unknown, as we did not start with a complete data set, which is a usual method in simulation studies comparing different missing data handling methods. Thus, the lack of a simulation study, that would empower the empirical data analyses, could also be considered as a methodological limitation, but this was not the purpose of the present work. Since, in the context of the present study only relative comparisons could be held among the different missing data handling techniques, we cannot conclude which imputation method is more accurate, only that the choice of method may affect both the beta coefficient of the studied relationship, as well as, its standard error. Therefore, our next step in the evaluation of the imputation methods would be to do a simulation study with a complete data set as the reference.",1405d5ad-7fa8-4653-b16b-abc4b4d65ada
40,discussion8,"  Conclusions In summary, older and less educated individuals, as well as, those with morbidities and unhealthier lifestyle habits, constitute a risk group for higher non-response rates when collecting nutrition and psychological data, and therefore, researchers should give special focus when interviewing them, in order to keep the gathered information response rate in high levels. In addition, the results from the applied data analyses revealed that the data imputation methodologies used to complete missing information, preferably the multiple imputation techniques, are trustable and may increase the validity and efficiency of the results.",0e31141b-315d-4845-b9dd-27f56db5412e
