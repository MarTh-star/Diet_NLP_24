0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Participants  We carried out a cross-sectional study on 954 elderly high-cardiovascular risk Mediterranean subjects. These white subjects of European ancestry were recruited in the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea)-Valencia study [56]. The Valencia field center is located on the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain). The subjects included in this study were those who had plasma adiponectin determination available at the baseline visit. These participants were recruited in primary health care centers, the inclusion criteria being as follows: elderly (between 55 and 80 years old for men and between 60 and 80 years old for women) and having a high cardiovascular risk, even though they were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline.",6d923451-d40f-4a50-bd07-f2900b4bfe99
1,methods1," Eligible subjects fulfilled at least one of the two criteria: type 2 diabetes; three or more of the following cardiovascular risk factors: current smoking; hypertension; dyslipidemia; body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) ≥ 25 kg/m2; and/or family history of premature cardiovascular disease [57,58]. These participants were recruited in the various primary health care centers of the Valencia region. Participants provided written informed consent and study protocols and procedures were approved according to the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration and by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Valencia University, Valencia (ethical approval code H1422226460525).  2.2. Baseline Anthropometric, Clinical, Biochemical and Lifestyle Variables  Anthropometric variables and blood pressure were determined at baseline by trained staff.",e574fab3-742e-455b-a94e-de6f08c51d25
2,methods2," Weight and height were measured with light clothing and no shoes with calibrated scales and a wall-mounted stadiometer, respectively, as previously reported. body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight (in kg) divided by the height (in m2). Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2. Waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest, after normal exhalation, using an anthropometric tape [56,58]. Further, in the baseline examination, we assessed demographic factors, cardiovascular risk factors, medications and lifestyle variables by validated questionnaires [58,59]. Type 2 diabetes was defined according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association-2018, as previously reported [57,58]. Blood pressure was measured by trained personnel using a validated semi-automatic oscillometer (Omron HEM-70CP; Hoofddorp, The Netherlands) with the subject seated.",cfa2f6cb-98b6-457f-b42e-e7a0c8e2e1f8
3,methods3," Physical activity was estimated by the validated Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity questionnaire as previously reported [56,57,58]. Smoking status was assessed by the World Health Organization questionnaire including five categories as previously reported [56,57,58,59]. Here, non-smokers and ex-smokers were combined and compared with current smokers. Thus, a dichotomic variable was used for smoking status.  As dietary variables for this study, we focused on the Mediterranean diet pattern. To measure the Mediterranean diet pattern, we used a validated 14-item scale [60], also administered at baseline. Detailed items of that scale with their response options are presented in Supplemental Table S1. Each question was scored 0 or 1. The final score ranged from 0 to 14. The higher the score, the greater the adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The degree of adherence was later dichotomized into high (≥9) and low (<9) depending on the population mean (9 points).  2.3.",491b3c7c-1ee3-46a3-86b7-4137c4e86900
4,methods4," Biochemical Determinations and Plasma Adiponectin Measures  Blood samples were collected after a 12-h overnight fast. Fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured using standard enzymatic automated methods as previously described [56,58]. In patients whose triglyceride levels were <400 mg/dL, LDL-C concentrations were estimated using the Friedewald formula. In addition, fasting blood samples were obtained for each participant and plasma was stored at −80 °C until further biochemical analyses. Fasting plasma adiponectin concentrations were measured and determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) kit (Cat. # EZHADP-61K), supplied by Linco Research, St. Charles, MO, USA, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",8f7a428a-7a49-496e-ad81-2f07fb671d77
5,methods5," The absorbance was read at 450 nm using the Multiskan EX spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Milford, NH, USA) and the Ascent Software program (Thermo Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland). All determinations were made in duplicate. Adiponectin concentrations were expressed in µg/mL. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 1.2% and that of the inter-assay was 2.1%.  2.4. DNA Isolation and Genotyping  Genomic DNA was isolated from blood. The quantity of double-stranded DNA was measured using PicoGreen (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Firstly, we selected the relevant polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene (adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ)) and undertook their specific genotyping. The four polymorphisms selected were initially the most commonly studied: a promoter variant, −11391 G/A (rs17300539) [49]; the T to G substitution in exon 2 (+45T > G, rs2241766); the G to T substitution in intron 2 (+276G > T, rs1501299) [47,48,49]; and rs17366568 (G > A) in intron 3 [35].",604c3f62-9764-4689-abbd-5107cdcfe8c1
6,methods6," The SNPs (rs17300539 and rs2241766) in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) gene were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) [61] using MspI and SmaI, respectively. TaqMan real-time PCR using pre-designed assays for allelic discrimination, containing specific probes for each allele (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), was used for the rs1501299 and the rs17366568 genotyping (C_7497299_10 and C_33187752_10, respectively) on a 7900HT Sequence Detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) [20]. Quality control measures of SNP genotyping were carried out including replicate quality control samples (10%) and no deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing.  Besides the genotyping of these pre-selected polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) gene, a high-density genotyping at the genome-wide level using the Infinium OmniExpress-24 BeadChip genotyping array (v1.0 and v1.1) (Illumina Inc.",073cf678-aa61-4577-b40b-b15b4d34a045
7,methods7,", San Diego, CA, USA) was then carried out. This array captures approximately 720,000 markers (the number varies depending on the version used: 730,000 for v.1.0 and 716,000 for v.1.1), and 699,221 markers that are common to both versions of the array (v1.0 and v.1.1) were used. Genome-wide genotyping was performed at the University of Valencia according to the manufacturer’s protocol with appropriate quality standards as previously reported [56]. Allele detection and genotype calling were performed in the GenomeStudio genotyping module (Illumina, Inc.). Data cleaning was performed using standard analysis pipelines implemented in the Phyton programming language combined with PLINK [62,63]. We filtered out the SNPs not mapped on autosomal chromosomes. In addition, SNPs with a minor allele frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF)) <0.01 or those that deviated from the expected Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 1.0 × 10−4) and SNPs with a call rate < 90% were removed.",3efac3ae-c96c-4db6-828b-9ddf47c7a428
8,methods8," Then, 625,127 variants passed quality controls with a total genotyping rate of 0.9964. Finally, besides the genome wide association study (GWAS) analysis of all the chip’s SNPs that surpassed the quality controls, we undertook a search for SNPs of the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) gene that were included in the OmniExpress-24 BeadChip genotyping array (v1.0 and v1.1) so as to specifically extract these results and analyze them as SNPs in candidate genes. Likewise, as the CDH13 gene is another of the candidates that has been associated with adiponectin levels in many genome wide association study (GWAS)s, we also pre-selected this gene as a candidate and extracted the SNPs that, for that gene, are found in the OmniExpress-24 BeadChip genotyping array. The corresponding genotype data were extracted by a Python script, created by the authors using the batch query resource SNP Report as previously reported [56]. Finally, the Python script produced the corresponding PLINK *.ped and *.",d67c64b8-96f6-4087-825b-f5d5e8d6870a
9,methods9,"map files of genotypes for statistical testing.  For SNP annotation (assigning the corresponding Gene Symbol to each rsID), we created a Phyton (version 3.7.4, 8 July 2019) script. This script uses an annotation database, designed and built with the database platform SQLite (version 3.33.0, 14 August 2020) (https://www.sqlite.org, accessed on 24 January 2021), containing data imported from the Infinium OmniExpress-24 BeadChip v1.2 genotyping array manifest (GRCh37) (https://emea.support.illumina.com/downloads/infinium-omniexpress-24-v1-2-product-files.html, accessed on 24 January 2021), and verified and completed with the NCBI SNP database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/, accessed on 24 January 2021, GRCh37 and GRCh38) data. In the case of intergenic SNPs, no Gene Symbol is assigned.  2.5. Statistical Analysis  2.5.1. General Associations and Candidate Gene Analysis  Plasma adiponectin and triglyceride levels were log-transformed (Ln) for the statistical analyses.",b9e9445a-b8ce-42ec-9eb5-846da052e1bd
10,methods10," First of all, we carried out descriptive statistical tests to summarize the characteristics of the sample studied. Chi-square tests were used to compare proportions. Student t-tests and ANOVA tests were applied to compare crude means of continuous variables. To estimate the association between adiponectin levels and plasma lipids, fasting glucose and adiposity-related variables, Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated. Analyses were carried out in the whole population and stratified by sex and diabetes status. To study the association between the four pre-selected SNPs (−11391 G/A, rs17300539; +45T > G, rs2241766; +276G > T, rs1501299; and rs17366568 G > A) in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) gene and plasma adiponectin levels, general linear models, unadjusted and adjusted for potential confounders, were used.",bb068e93-55f6-4a5f-97b9-904d0ebdf58a
11,methods11," Models were sequentially fitted as follows: model 1, unadjusted; model 2, adjusted for age and sex; model 3, additionally adjusted for type 2 diabetes; and model 4, additionally adjusted for body mass index (BMI). Further adjustment for smoking, physical activity and adherence to the Mediterranean diet was carried out when indicated. Adjusted means for continuous variables were estimated from the multivariable adjusted general linear models. The genetic effect for SNPs was considered as additive (alleles 0, 1, and 2 for the minor allele). To test gene–diet interactions between the four pre-selected adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) polymorphisms and the Mediterranean diet pattern, we used the 14-item score as a categorical variable. To do so, we considered two categories based on the population mean: low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (8 points or lower) or high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (score of 9 points or higher).",7f4e9802-470d-4f5f-a1cd-fbaa7cf316dd
12,methods12," We also tested the interaction with the adherence variable as continuous with 14 points in order to compare results, when indicated. To analyze the gene-diet interactions in determining adiponectin concentrations, general linear hierarchical models were used in which the main effects and the interaction term were included. In each analysis, the confounding variables for adjustment were indicated in the tests. Besides testing the associations of the pre-selected polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) gene with adiponectin levels, associations with plasma lipid levels, fasting glucose and anthropometric variables were also tested for the most relevant pre-selected SNP. Likewise, gene-diet interactions with the Mediterranean diet for these variables were computed. In addition, the associations of the most significant adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) polymorphism, as well as the gene-diet interactions, considering prevalent type 2 diabetes as the outcome variable, were tested.",a1375628-b7cd-4c69-8636-7f98a4243454
13,methods13," Thus, uni- and multi-variant logistic regression models were used (including interaction terms or not, depending on the case). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the corresponding variables were estimated. Analyses were undertaken for the whole population and stratified by sex when indicated. These statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics (version 26.0), New York, NY, USA. All tests were two-tailed and p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant for these associations.  2.5.2. genome wide association study (GWAS)s Analyses  For the genome wide association study (GWAS) on adiponectin levels (Ln-transformed), association analyses were carried out using PLINK v1.9 [62,63]. Additive genetic models were fitted. General linear regression models were used, and regression coefficients and standard error (SE) were estimated.",79493d96-b76e-40b0-8f3e-766de8f95ae9
14,methods14," Model 1 (unadjusted), model 2 (adjusted for sex and age), model 3 (additionally adjusted for diabetes) and model 4 (adjusted for sex, age, diabetes and body mass index (BMI)) were computed. Beta regression coefficients for the minor allele were obtained. These analyses were performed in the whole population and stratified by sex and type 2 diabetes when indicated. Moreover, gene-Mediterranean diet interactions at the genome-wide level (including all the array SNPs that passed the quality control, as previously mentioned) in determining plasma adiponectin levels were analyzed. Additive genetic models were considered for the SNPs, and the Mediterranean diet was analyzed as categorical (low and high adherence). Hierarchical general linear regression models were fitted and the p-values for the SNP-diet interactions terms were computed.",68e6e8f8-dc36-4ae1-b25e-615e227df36e
15,methods15,"  We applied the conventional threshold of p < 5 × 10−8 for genome-wide statistical significance, as well as the standard p-value for suggestive genome-wide significance (p < 1 × 10−5).  We used Haploview (version 4.2) [64] and Functional Mapping and Annotation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (Functional Mapping and Annotation of Genome Wide Association Studies (FUMA)) [65] to create Manhattan plots and to calculate the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the SNPs of interest. Quantile-quantile plots comparing the expected and observed p-values were performed in the R-statistical environment and with Functional Mapping and Annotation of Genome Wide Association Studies (FUMA) [65,66]. We used LocusZoom-Single Plot (http://locuszoom.org/; accessed on 24 January 2021) and LocusZoom.js (https://my.locuszoom.",bcc4c9f5-96dd-40f7-b20b-cd0e13d77563
16,methods16,"org/, accessed on 24 January 2021) to generate locus-specific graphical displays of the position of the selected SNPs in the genome wide association study (GWAS) to nearby genes and local recombination hotspots [67], as well as to indicate the LD. SNiPA, a tool for annotating and browsing genetic variants [68], was also used to display the LD between the selected SNPs and the nearby SNPs in regional plots using data from the European population based on the 1000 Genomes Project, incorporated in that tool.  Finally, we carried out additional association analyses for some top-ranked interesting SNPs as potentially novel signals for plasma adiponectin, including stratification by sex or by Mediterranean diet adherence strata, and additional adjustment for co-variates.  3. Results  3.1. Participant Characteristics  The demographic, anthropometric, clinical, biochemical and lifestyle characteristics of the study participants at baseline are presented in Table 1.",e44485ca-fb7c-48a8-8268-6b875fe5d78d
17,methods17,"  We included 954 subjects (348 men and 606 women) that, in addition to the general variables of the study, had plasma adiponectin measured at baseline available. They consisted of older men and women (mean age 67 ± 0.2 years). Mean adiponectin levels were 7.8 ± 0.2 for men and 11.9 ± 0.2 μg/mL for women. We used these values as sex-specific cut-off points to create a sex-specific dichotomous variable to define low and high adiponectin levels, taking into account the strong differences per sex. Prevalence of type 2 diabetes was high (47.2%) in the whole population. Obesity prevalence was also high (50.1% in the whole population).  3.2. Associations between Plasma Adiponectin and Fasting Glucose, Plasma Lipids, Adiposity Variables and Type 2 Diabetes  Table 2 shows associations between plasma adiponectin and fasting glucose, lipids and adiposity in the whole population and per sex. In the whole population, adiponectin was positively correlated with HDL-C (r = 0.39; p = 5.",4b1effff-413f-4ccd-893c-e77c8a65d3d5
18,methods18,"6 × 10−36) and negatively correlated with triglycerides (r = −0.28; p = 4.7 × 10−18) and fasting glucose (r = −0.26; p = 3.5 × 10−16). A significant inverse correlation at p = 0.006 was also found between adiponectin and waist circumference, although the correlation coefficient was relatively weak (r = −0.009). Similar results were found for men and women, although higher associations were detected in women.  Table 3 shows the association between adiponectin and type 2 diabetes at baseline. High plasma adiponectin was associated with lower type 2 diabetes risk in the whole population (OR = 0.61; 95%CI: 0.46–0.80; p = 4.4 × 10−4) for the dichotomous variable for adiponectin (high versus low concentrations), in a model adjusted for sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, physical activity and adherence to the Mediterranean diet.",76263225-fe79-4b9b-bde2-a28076cb867b
19,methods19," Likewise, when the continuous variable for adiponectin concentrations was used, we observed a strong inverse association, indicating the importance of the dose–effect. In the multivariate adjusted model, the OR was 0.47; 95%CI (0.35–0.63), p = 3.0 × 10−7, per unit increase in adiponectin. On analyzing the results per sex, higher protection was observed in women.  3.3. Association between the Pre-Selected adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) SNPs and Plasma Adiponectin Concentrations. Interactions with Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet  First, we analyzed the association between adiponectin and adherence to the Mediterranean diet score. We did not detect any statistically significant differences in plasma adiponectin depending on the low or high level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (p = 0.531) after multivariate adjustment for sex, age, type 2 diabetes, body mass index (BMI), smoking and physical activity.",6f6718c4-2126-4c82-bce5-ce23c47d23a7
20,methods20," To identify specific foods relevant for adiponectin levels on this pattern, we also examined the association with specific food items included in the Mediterranean diet score. Sex-specific adiponectin levels were used, bearing in mind that adiponectin is significantly higher in women (p = 1.37 × 10−30). Thus, according to the cut-off values defined by the corresponding adiponectin means for men and women in Table 1, a dichotomous variable for sex-specific low and high adiponectin levels was created. In this categorical variable, low adiponectin levels were defined as having plasma adiponectin levels lower than 7.8 for men and less than 11.9 μg/mL for women. Likewise, high adiponectin levels were levels ≥ 7.8 or 11.9 μg/mL for men and women, respectively. Supplementary Table S2 shows the association between all the foods included in the Mediterranean diet adherence pattern score and the sex-specific adiponectin levels (low and high).",328731ad-8e81-4872-bd91-0881fcfef1cc
21,methods21," No statistically significant associations for any food items were observed (p > 0.05 for all). Therefore, we used the total score for adherence to the Mediterranean diet as the main variable to test gene-diet interactions in further analyses.  Later, we examined the association between the four pre-selected candidate SNPs in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) gene: −11391 G/A (rs17300539); the T to G substitution in exon 2 (+45T > G, rs2241766); the G to T substitution in intron 2 (+276G > T, rs1501299); and rs17366568 (G > A) in intron 3, and adiponectin concentrations. Table 4 shows adiponectin means per genotype for each SNP. We only observed strong and additive associations for the −11391 G/A (rs17300539) polymorphism. The minor allele was associated with statistically significant higher adiponectin concentrations (p = 7.2 × 10−5) in the multivariable adjusted model.  For +276G > T (rs1501299), we obtained borderline significant associations.",71e060a1-340e-4405-8599-bfe6efcab73d
22,methods22," Interestingly, no statistically significant associations with adiponectin concentrations were observed for the rs17366568 (G > A) SNP (p = 0.257). This SNP was the most significantly associated with adiponectin levels (identified as the lead SNP) in the meta-analysis carried out in several European populations and published by Heid et al. (35). However, in this meta-analysis, the rs17366568 (G > A) SNP did not reach the statistical significance (p = 0.481) for the only Mediterranean population analyzed (from Italy, the InChianti study), suggesting potential population-specific differences in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) architecture and associations.  Regarding gene-diet interactions, we did not detect any statistically significant interactions between each one of the four pre-selected adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) candidate SNPs and adherence to the Mediterranean diet in determining plasma adiponectin concentrations in the whole population (p > 0.05 for all).",488ff413-5e4d-4f53-9178-18c9c658e24c
23,methods23,"  Supplemental Table S3 presents the associations and gene-diet interactions with the Mediterranean diet between the −11391 G/A (rs17300539) polymorphism and metabolic traits. Despite the strong association between this SNP and plasma adiponectin concentrations, no significant associations were obtained for this polymorphism and fasting glucose, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, HDL-C or type 2 diabetes.  3.4. genome wide association study (GWAS) for Plasma Adiponectin Concentrations in the Whole Population  We first carried out a genome wide association study (GWAS) for plasma adiponectin concentrations (ln-transformed) according to model 1 (unadjusted additive genetic model). We obtained several associations at the suggestive genome-wide significance level (p < 1.0 × 10−5). The lead SNP in this model was rs6705747, intergenic on chromosome 2 with p = 1.32 × 10−7 and minor allele frequency (MAF): 0.294.

This is the first time an SNP in the VAT1L gene is suggested to be related to adiponectin levels.  After adjustment for sex and age, the statistical significance for the VAT1L SNP was 6.9 × 10−6. After additional adjustment for diabetes and body mass index (BMI), the statistical significance of the rs11647294-VAT1L SNP was attenuated (p = 1.0 × 10−5), and other SNPs reached more statistical significance.

After this adjustment for sex, age, type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI), the lead SNP in the genome wide association study (GWAS) for adiponectin was rs9738548 (intergenic) on chromosome 12 (p = 1.1 × 10−6). Figure 1 shows the regional plot for this lead SNP. The MIR3612 gene is close to this intergenic SNP.  RAB40C (Ras-Related Protein Rab-40C) was also top-ranked at p = 4.4 × 10−6, but its minor allele frequency (MAF) was relatively low. With a higher minor allele frequency (MAF) (0.228), we detected an SNP in HPS5 (Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome).

We considered rs11647294-VATL1 to be a promising candidate SNP for further analyses into plasma adiponectin concentrations and so studied the homogeneity of the association with adiponectin per sex strata. Figure 4 presents plasma adiponectin concentrations in men (panel A) and in women (panel B) depending on the rs11647294-VATL1 SNP. This SNP was significantly associated with adiponectin concentrations, both in men and in women, in the unadjusted model. The associations remained statistically significant even after further adjustment for sex, age, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), smoking, physical activity and adherence to the Mediterranean diet.  3.5.",6579b598-9abc-41c1-b075-6013b0df3d83
27,methods27," adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) and CDH13 Genes and Plasma Adiponectin Concentrations in the genome wide association study (GWAS)  As we did not observe a top-ranked signal for SNPs in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) and CDH13 candidate genes, we examined the specific associations of these SNPs in the genome wide association study (GWAS). We extracted all the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) SNPs present in the OmniExpress Illumina array and checked the associations with plasma adiponectin concentrations. Supplemental Figure S3 presents the LD plot between the 10 ADIPQ SNPs included in the array and the pre-selected SNPs analyzed. The −11391 G/A (rs17300539) SNP was not included in the array, and its LD with other adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) SNPs is low. This SNP was detected at p = 7.2 × 10−5 in our previous candidate gene analysis with adiponectin concentrations (a little bit below the suggestive level of the genome wide association study (GWAS) significance, p = 1.0 × 10−5).",afff54b5-f47f-40f0-beef-69fb72e0e8fa

The most significant adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) SNP in the model adjusted for sex, age, diabetes and body mass index (BMI) was the rs1501299 SNP, the only one that was common to both the array and our pre-selected list. The association with adiponectin was borderline significant, mimicking the results previously obtained in the candidate gene analysis.  Supplemental Table S5 presents the associations between the top-ranked CDH13 SNPs of the CDH13 SNPs included in the array and plasma adiponectin concentrations. Only one SNP reached statistical significance at the nominal p-value (rs4782726, p = 0.016), indicating that the CDH13 gene is not a relevant locus for adiponectin concentrations in this Mediterranean population.  3.6.

30,methods30," Analysis per Diabetes Status  In the genome wide association study (GWAS)s stratified by diabetes status (Table 6), we detected a statistically significant association at the genome wide association study (GWAS) level of significance in non-diabetic subjects for the rs2850066 SNP (p = 3.5 × 10−8), in the model adjusted for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). This SNP is located in the LOC101928269 gene on chromosome 21.  Figure 5 presents the regional plot for the rs2850066 SNP, located near the MIR802 gene and near the SETD4 (SET Domain Containing 4) genes.  Other SNPs in non-diabetic subjects reached the suggestive genome-wide level of significance (rs2835220, rs1283468, rs12887387, rs2146971 and rs11024603). In diabetic subjects, the most significant SNP was rs5992838 (intergenic) with p = 7.73 × 10−6. However, an interesting top-ranked SNP is rs7616406 in the CAND2 (Cullin Associated And Neddylation Dissociated 2) gene on chromosome 3.",57f7f3ea-4e0e-4fa3-8027-a3ecf647c15e

Gene–Mediterranean Diet Interactions for Adiponectin Concentrations at the Genome-Wide Level  Table 7 shows the top-ranked SNPs in the corresponding exploratory genome wide association study (GWAS) for the study of gene-Mediterranean diet interactions. Several SNPs reached the suggestive genome-wide level of significance for the gene-diet interaction term analyzed. The most significant interaction term with the Mediterranean diet adherence (low versus high) was for the rs17249128 SNP (p = 2.5 × 10−7), located in LOC101927334 on chromosome 16. Supplemental Figure S7 shows the LD regional plot for this SNP.  Table 7 also shows the beta coefficients for each stratum.",ac8ba9ce-74b0-4349-9d8d-d9d20c01d36f
32,methods32," Beta 1 corresponds to the effect of the minor allele of the indicated SNP on plasma adiponectin concentrations in the low adherence to the Mediterranean diet, and beta 2 indicates the regression coefficient for the minor allele for high adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The minor allele frequency (MAF) for the top-ranked SNP (rs17249128) is high (0.466), being an interesting candidate SNP for further investigation. Another very remarkable SNP in the top-ranked list of gene-diet interactions is rs2917570 in opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule (OPCML) (Opioid Binding Protein/Cell Adhesion Molecule Like) on chromosome 3. Interestingly, SNPs in the opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule (OPCML) gene have been associated with adiponectin concentrations in previous genome wide association study (GWAS)s carried out in some European populations [35], but not in others [35]. The existence of a gene-diet interaction may explain these previous results.",d7b2902c-2cc0-45d6-af3d-028c4829e56a
33,methods33," In our study, when adherence to the Mediterranean diet is low, the minor allele of the rs2917570 SNP is associated with higher adiponectin concentrations (B = 0.113, p = 0.008). However, when adherence to the Mediterranean diet is high, the minor allele is associated with lower adiponectin concentrations (B= −0.118, p = 0.003); p for this SNP–Mediterranean diet interaction is 5.1 × 10−6.  Figure 6 depicts such a gene-Mediterranean diet interaction in panels A (low adherence) and B (high adherence). Additional adjustment for age, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), smoking and physical activity did not change the statistical significance level for the associations.  Finally, we would like to mention that we obtained a top-ranked gene-Mediterranean diet interaction signal (p = 1.5 × 10−5) involving PARP1 (Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1). This gene has been related to adiponectin gene expression [69,70] and some dietary modulation has been reported in animal models [70,71].  4.",51f6e46a-f83c-44a9-9952-0d234103d7a0
34,methods34," Discussion  In this study carried out in a high-cardiovascular risk Mediterranean population, we found that plasma adiponectin levels were higher in women and directly associated with higher HDL-C and inversely associated with fasting triglycerides and fasting glucose levels, as well as with lower type 2 diabetes risk, even after multivariate adjustment. These findings are in accordance with many previous reports in other populations of various ethnic backgrounds [72,73,74,75,76]. The robust linear inverse association between plasma adiponectin concentrations and type 2 diabetes risk observed in our population, mainly in women, is concordant with other reports where associations with adiponectin levels were stronger in individuals with a higher metabolic risk profile [77,78,79], supporting the idea that the association between adiponectin concentrations and type 2 diabetes is stronger in subjects with higher body mass index (BMI).",680b1c6c-8648-4596-90f6-c7c0afea9e6e
35,methods35,"  In our population, the direct and inverse associations between plasma adiponectin and fasting glucose, type 2 diabetes or lipid levels remained statistically significant even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). The mechanisms explaining these protective associations are far from being determined, but there is some agreement suggesting that the anti-inflammatory properties of adiponectin [15,80] are likely to be the major component of its beneficial effects against insulin resistance [15,16,17,76,81,82]. However, in this study, we did not have data on inflammation markers for most of the participants, so we were unable to analyze these associations. We did, nevertheless, have data on genetic polymorphisms, both at the candidate gene level and at the genome-wide level, and found some interesting suggestive associations.",18664ade-4016-4ab9-bbe3-df0f073b93a3
36,methods36," Firstly, we set out to analyze the associations between four well-known candidate SNPs in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) gene and plasma adiponectin levels, subsequently carrying out an exploratory genome wide association study (GWAS), given that very few reports have focused on Mediterranean subjects (mainly those including Italian participants) and it is known that even though specific genome wide association study (GWAS)-population associations may exist, they can misestimate across global populations [83,84]. Although many genome wide association study (GWAS)s have been carried out on adiponectin in populations of Europe or with European ancestry in North America [35,41,42,43,44,45], the Spanish Mediterranean population has not been included in these meta-analyses. Thus, it is necessary to carry out specific studies on this population.",60bc81b6-15d6-4942-9dd5-fb0afa73d818
37,methods37,"  Despite the small sample size of our study (954 participants), we opted to undertake an exploratory genome wide association study (GWAS) to at least identify the genetic variants most associated with plasma adiponectin levels in high-cardiovascular risk Mediterranean subjects. In previous studies on Spanish Mediterranean individuals, we were able to detect, at the genome wide association study (GWAS) level of significance, the main expected top-ranked SNPs in genes consistently associated with several traits with a strong genetic influence (plasma bilirubin, polyunsaturated fatty acids and bitter taste perception), with even smaller sample sizes [85,86,87]. For adiponectin, if the genetic association between the main SNPs in candidate genes consistently reported in other populations (adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) or CDH13) is strong, our sample size would be enough to detect them at the genome wide association study (GWAS) level.",2369be4e-5f63-4016-90d3-b5152e0576e5
38,methods38," Thus, in a previous genome wide association study (GWAS) carried out on a Korean population [34], with an initial sample size similar to ours (about 950 participants), the authors detected some statistically significant associations at the genome wide association study (GWAS) level with SNPs in the CDH13 gene, which is more important in Asian populations than in European ones [34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45]. In this Korean population [34], the top-ranked SNP was rs3865188-CDH13 with minor allele frequency (MAF): 0.309, reaching a p-value of 5 × 10−15. In our study, we did not detect any association at the genome wide association study (GWAS) level (p < 5 × 10−8) or at the suggestive level of significance (p < 1 × 10−5) with SNPs in the CDH13 gene and adiponectin concentrations.",48a5e532-2cbb-4775-9760-03c64e60e1dd
39,methods39,"  In our exploratory genome wide association study (GWAS), for adiponectin concentrations in the whole population, we detected some signals at the suggestive level of genome wide association study (GWAS) significance (p < 1 × 10−5), including the rs9738548 (intergenic) SNP on chromosome 12, the rs11647294-VAT1L SNP on chromosome 16, the rs12149200-RAB40C SNP on chromosome 16 and the rs1124603-HPS5 SNP on chromosome 11, among others. As far as we know, this is the first time that our top-ranked SNPs have been reported as being associated with adiponectin concentrations. Some of these signals may be false positive associations, and replication, mainly in this population and in other populations, is needed to confirm the signals. Several SNPs on chromosome 12 have been identified as genome-wide signals in the adiponectin meta-analysis of 45,891 individuals carried out by Dastani et al. [41].",bee8382b-05a6-4d6c-93a9-d585f5da2821
40,methods40," These signals were the following: rs601339-GPR109A; rs6488898-ATP6V0A2; rs7133378-DNAH10; rs7305864-CCDC92; and rs7978610-ZNF664. Likewise, in this meta-analysis [41], several SNPs on chromosome 16 reached the genome-wide level of significance. In addition to the strong signals on CDH13, located on chromosome 16, other genome-wide signals included the rs2925979-CMIP SNP. Our top-ranked SNPs also included two SNPs on chromosome 16 (rs11647294-VAT1L and rs12149200-RAB40C). Among these top-ranked SNPs for plasma adiponectin in this high-cardiovascular risk Mediterranean population, we suggest that an interesting candidate would be the rs11647294-VAT1L SNP. This SNP has a high minor allele frequency (MAF) (0.401), supporting a more stable association with adiponectin concentrations in comparison with the potential bias related to low-frequency variants in studies with a small sample size. Thus, it has been reported that common SNPs (minor allele frequency (MAF): 0.25–0.",c640e0bf-dc61-47dc-b192-de2b9bd52348
41,methods41,"50) result in significantly fewer false positives than for less common SNPs [88]. Moreover, we conducted a stratified analysis per sex between the rs11647294-VAT1L SNP and adiponectin concentrations in men and women, and we observed statistically significant associations in both men and women strata, therefore increasing the level of evidence against a false positive association. The VAT1L gene has been associated with schizophrenia in some genome wide association study (GWAS)s and subsequent pathway enrichment analysis suggested its involvement in neural and immune system-related pathways [89]. Likewise, the VAT1L gene has been associated with the von Economo neurons in brain functional analyses [90] and in calcific aortic valve disease [91], among other diseases [92,93]. Functionally, the VAT1L gene has been linked to several immune system pathways [89,91], and adiponectin levels could be related to these pathways [15,94].",51cc5b02-ad2e-45ed-be7c-957b20f3f5be
42,methods42,"  Regarding the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) SNPs, we did not identify such SNPs among the top-ranked in any of the genome wide association study (GWAS) strata of this population, as initially expected according to the genome wide association study (GWAS)s carried out in several European populations [41,42,43,44,45]. We, therefore, proceeded to extract all the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) SNPs that were in the array to carry out a more detailed study. For the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) gene, the number of SNPs included in the array was low (n = 10) and none of them showed statistical significance at the p < 0.05 level. The most significant, although without reaching p < 0.05, was rs1501299, which had already been previously analyzed in our initial list of the four pre-selected candidate SNPs in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) gene, therefore being consistent with our previous findings.",2f7b73b9-7c3f-4f5c-8de2-c2b72ea8650d
43,methods43," The association between the candidate SNPs +276G > T (rs1501299) and +45T > G (rs2241766) with plasma adiponectin has been heterogeneous across diverse populations [29,41,46,47,48,49,50,95,96]. Of the four candidate SNPs analyzed, we only observed strong and additive associations for the −11391 G/A (rs17300539) polymorphism, in agreement with several studies showing significant associations for this variant [49,50]. However, we did not find any significant association for the rs17366568 (G > A) SNP, which was the SNP most significantly associated with adiponectin levels in the meta-analysis carried out by Heid et al. in European populations [35].",9efad7bd-de88-497a-b5b6-e66887b9f234
44,methods44," Interestingly, in this meta-analysis, despite the global association, when we look at specific populations, in agreement with our results, the rs17366568 SNP did not reach statistical significance for the only Mediterranean population analyzed (Italian subjects from the InChianti study, Italy) [35], therefore increasing the evidence of potential population-specific differences.  On the other hand, the −11391 G/A (rs17300539) polymorphism in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) gene was significantly associated (p = 7.2 × 10−5) with adiponectin concentrations in our Mediterranean population in the separate candidate gene analysis. However, we did not observe such association in the genome wide association study (GWAS) because this SNP was not included in the array.",4682d8a2-00d7-4059-9e99-de206e44febb
45,methods45," If we had carried out an imputation analysis, we could have possibly detected this signal or that of other SNPs in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) gene among the top-ranked, but without reaching the genome wide association study (GWAS) level (because this association, despite being high, did not reach the genome wide association study (GWAS) level of statistical significance, nor the suggestive significance level, although being close). In our case, we preferred to undertake the exploratory genome wide association study (GWAS) with directly analyzed SNPs without using imputations in order to avoid the bias due to low imputation quality due to a not very large sample size.",2f39a174-5708-462d-b789-a995afd253d0
46,methods46,"  Furthermore, we carried out sex-specific and diabetes-specific genome wide association study (GWAS)s to detect if the high-cardiovascular risk characteristics of our population provide a profile of associations in candidate genes that differs from the most commonly studied populations in other genome wide association study (GWAS)s, from which diabetic subjects are sometimes excluded and which generally include a younger population with a lower cardiovascular risk. Having consulted the published genome wide association study (GWAS) results in greater detail [34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45], we observed that although the greatest associations are found for SNPs in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) and CDH13 genes, the other top-ranked genes differ widely between populations, indicating great heterogeneity in the findings depending on the participant characteristics.",9042c91b-4694-45c0-956c-c3b711d17f0a
47,methods47," This fact deserves much more attention, since the SNPs in the two top-ranked genes explain a very low percentage of adiponectin variance and there will surely be many other genes associated with it, but whose contribution may be highly variable and dynamic depending on the geographic origin, age, sex and the presence or absence of obesity and/or diabetes in the analyzed populations. Therefore, subsequent studies should take this perspective into account when interpreting the results and undertaking statistical analyses by presenting more information on the top-ranked SNPs in each population analyzed, instead of presenting the summary of genome wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses.  One limitation of our study is the small sample size compared with other genome wide association study (GWAS)s undertaken on other populations. This limits its statistical power, as clearly it would have been much better to have studied a larger population.",f1c626ad-8e2b-4d60-a76d-4774077e658b
48,methods48," However, as the Spanish Mediterranean population is under-represented in the studies published so far, it is of great interest to have these results available, given that they are the first on this population.  Moreover, despite our small sample size, in our exploratory gene–diet interaction study, we detected some suggestive gene-Mediterranean diet interactions on analyzing SNPs at the genome-wide level. Among them, we consider as promising for further analysis the interaction found with the rs2917570 SNP in the opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule (OPCML) gene. SNPs in this gene have been associated with adiponectin concentrations in previous genome wide association study (GWAS)s in some European populations [35], but replication is low. The existence of a gene–diet interaction may help to explain some previous inconsistent results. Likewise, another relevant gene-Mediterranean diet interaction to be explored in further studies is that involving the PARP1 gene.",7294aaac-cd7e-444b-850e-0e4db9e89b9a
49,methods49," This gene has been related to adiponectin gene expression in functional studies [69,70] and some dietary modulation has been reported in adipose tissue of mice in response to high-fat diet feeding or calorie restriction [71]. These previous results contribute to increase the importance of the observed gene-Mediterranean diet interaction encompassing the rs3219110-PARP1 polymorphism. As this work is only statistical and exploratory, we could not undertake a mechanistic study to suggest potential mechanisms explaining these SNP–diet interactions. With our results, other authors will be able to carry out additional studies to better characterize the possible interaction mechanisms.  5.",0f47d531-90fd-4c0e-a1a0-0690abb8d131
50,methods50," Conclusions  Our results indicate that plasma adiponectin is strongly associated with a favorable lipid profile (high HDL-C and low triglycerides) and inversely related to type 2 diabetes risk in this high-cardiovascular risk Mediterranean population, in agreement with previous results in diverse populations. However, the genetic variants more associated with plasma adiponectin concentrations could be population-specific and influenced by sex and diabetes status. Moreover, in our exploratory analysis, despite the small sample size, we detected some suggestive gene-Mediterranean diet interactions at the genome wide association study (GWAS) level that may be interesting for further characterization in later studies in this population and in other populations.
