0,introduction0," Decreased cerebral blood flow (cerebral blood flow (CBF)) due to the occlusion of the blood vessels leads to ischemic stroke. Subsequently, activation of pathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, inflammation, and apoptosis, potentiates the ischemic injury. Each of those pathological processes have been the central focus of research for new stroke therapies. However, the treatment options are still limited: acute treatment with the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator to resolve obstructive blood clots is the only FDA-approved drug for acute intervention, apart from mechanical thrombectomy 1,2. However, it has a restrictive time window and may induce severe complications 3 such as haemorrhagic transformation 4. Furthermore, no other drug is available in clinical practice for the rehabilitation of patients at later stages of the disease.",7561999c-0728-4081-ba56-e94277475916
1,introduction1,"  An ischemic event and potential reperfusion of the injured tissue causes a misbalance in the production of free radicals (reactive oxygen (radicals (reactive oxygen (ROS)) and nitrogen (radicals (reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS)) species) in brain parenchyma and periphery 5,6. Efforts have focused on new neuroprotective compounds able to block or scavenge the excess of free radicals 3,5. While animal research supported the use of antioxidant agents, most of these antioxidants fail to be effective in human clinical trials because of the short half-life and/or human comorbidities 3,5.  Oxidative stress contributes to the post-ischemic inflammatory response, with the release of inflammatory mediators and concomitant blood-brain barrier disruption. As a result, an inflammatory environment emerges, driven by activated innate and peripheral immune cells playing a pivotal role in stroke resolution.",86a79214-b34c-4729-86d0-62f1d5a5d5d7
2,introduction2," Although neuroinflammation (NI) is key for tissue repair and remodelling, it may also be detrimental by increasing tissue injury 7. The balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory stimuli drives the functional polarization of many immune cells such as microglia/macrophages (Iba-1+, F4/80+, CD11b+ cells), astrocytes (GFAP+ cells) and neutrophils into beneficial or detrimental phenotypes 8,9. In stroke, microglia/macrophages showed an enhanced beneficial anti-inflammatory phenotype within the first week, but expressed a more detrimental pro-inflammatory genes signature at later stages 8,10, peaking around day 14 post ischemia 11. However, the concept of differential waves of anti- and pro-inflammatory microglia is still too simplistic to illustrate the complex spatiotemporal changes of the transcriptomic and proteomic microglial profile in response to injury 12,13.",4e60e093-5a12-436d-b8b2-cce1f91ccfc4
3,introduction3,"  Although both processes occur sequentially, the anti-inflammatory response might not be sufficient very early after stroke to balance the detrimental effects of the pro-inflammatory burst. The degree and heterogeneity of immune cells in post-ischemic tissues make the inflammatory response a potential drug target for stroke immunotherapy 8,14. Therapeutic strategies include enhancing an anti-inflammatory environment, inhibition of pro-inflammatory stimuli and a phenotypical switch toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Despite significant advances towards better therapies, no immunomodulatory drugs are available yet 7,10,14. The future success of immunomodulatory therapies rely on the elucidation of the immune interactions and promote tissue repair 15.  Hydroxytyrosol (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-ethanol, HT) 16 is recognized as a potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective molecule 17-20.",94cb143e-9148-479a-821f-6d937d6ffa89
4,introduction4," HT is redundantly associated to the Mediterranean diet since it is the main phenolic compound of the extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) extracts 20-24. Human trials indicated that an extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)-based Mediterranean diet reduced the risk of stroke 25,26, raising interest as a complementary beneficial approach. HT exerts a wide range of beneficial effects while mechanisms of action are still unclear 17. HT elicits direct scavenging effects on radicals (reactive oxygen (ROS)/radicals (reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) but also activates mechanisms that counteract oxidative damage 6,17,24, by protecting viable tissue and vascular cells 24,27. Concomitant with its strong antioxidant property, HT has been reported to possess high anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in animal models of inflammation 17,28,29, by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory markers 19,29.",43e9f2da-dc14-45df-a910-eb87eec9c4bf
5,introduction5," In vitro evidences showed decreased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and MMP-9 levels in activated murine macrophages 30, and stimulated human monocytes 31, mediated by inhibition of the nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and PKCα/PKCβ1 respectively. However, contradictory results in human macrophages were obtained by Bigali et al. (2018), showing no effect on iNOS but on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels and transcription factor Nrf2, overall attenuating inflammation 32. An in vivo study confirmed the reduction of COX-2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels in plasma in a murine inflammation model 29.  Despite its role in preventing ischemic events 26,33, the therapeutic effects of HT have been scarcely studied in stroke animal models 34.",3eb36297-e52f-45ed-bc7e-92f5a9f0c2f2
6,introduction6,"  In the present study, we investigated the possible therapeutic effects of a HT-enriched diet as therapeutic intervention after transient ischemic stroke on the neuro-inflammatory response, cerebrovascular, and functional parameters in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)o) mouse model (30 minutes) using in vivo multimodal imaging and behavioural tests. To do so, we performed a longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging study to monitor the underlying mechanisms occurring at the different stages of the disease and therapy response. We investigated the effects of HT on the Translocator protein (TSPO)-dependent neuroinflammatory reaction, the infarct volume and vascular parameters (diffusion and perfusion). We also assessed sensorimotor functions prior and after surgery and therapy effect on motor functions recovery using behavioural tests.",15922a74-190d-4c5f-b7be-be52b731452b
7,introduction7," Blood samples were collected on the last day of the experiment to assess peripheral markers including nitric oxide (NO) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)), as indexes of vascular integrity and lipid peroxidation, respectively. Brains were collected on the last day of the experiment to investigate the cellular source of Translocator protein (TSPO) expression in the chronic phase, including microglia/macrophages (Iba-1+, F4/80+), expression of the anti-inflammatory marker CD163 and astrocytes (GFAP+).  We hypothesized that HT may have immunomodulatory functions in the post-ischemic phase, able to modify the inflammatory landscape. Potential therapy effects may be non-invasively detected by [18F]DPA-714 as a biomarker for glial activation and by T2-weighted MR (lesion), diffusion-weighted (cellular density) and perfusion-weighted (cerebral blood flow) MR imaging.",760743e2-de64-410a-a150-b825b9850de1

9,methods0," A total of N = 22 male C57BL/6 mice were fed with either a standard chow (n = 11) or a HT enriched diet (n = 11) for 35 days, following a 30 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)o). T2-weighted (lesion) and perfusion (cerebral blood flow)-/diffusion (cellular density)-weighted MR images were acquired at days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 30 post ischemia. [18F]DPA-714 (Translocator protein (TSPO), neuroinflammation marker) PET-CT scans were acquired at days 7, 14, 21 and 30 post ischemia. Infarct volume (mm3), cerebral blood flow (mL/100g/min), apparent diffusion coefficient (10-4·mm2/s) and percentage of injected tracer dose (%ID/mL) were assessed.  Behavioural tests (grip test, rotarod, open field, pole test) were performed prior and after ischemia to access therapy effects on sensorimotor functions.",a2da5c05-2c8c-4eb3-9c97-c3eefe03f77e
10,methods1,"  Ex vivo analyses (immunohistochemistry (IHC), IF, WB) were performed to quantify Translocator protein (TSPO) expression, immune cells including microglia/macrophages (Iba-1, F4/80), astrocytes (GFAP) and peripheral markers in serum such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)) and nitric oxide (NO) 35 days post ischemia. Additionally, gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers were assessed by rt-qPCR, including tspo, cd163, arg1, tnf and Il-1β.   Animals  All experiments were conducted in accordance with the German Law on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz of North Rhine-Westphalia and according to the ARRIVE guidelines (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines) 35.  3-4 months old C57BL/6J mice (N = 22, 20-25 g in body weight) were housed in a temperature-controlled (25 °C) and humidity-controlled (40%) facility with a 12:12h light:dark cycle.",3eefcbd7-99c9-4b75-af57-d4ccc9bb0aa2
11,methods2," Food and water were available ad libitum.  After transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, mice were randomly assigned by an external person to either a control (n = 11) or a hydroxytyrosol (n = 11) diet. Experimenters were blinded during the procedures and did not know which animal was assigned to the treatment group until the data analysis was performed.  N= 8 mice per group were used for in vivo imaging purpose and behavioural assessment. Besides, n = 3 mice per group were added for ex vivo analysis at day 35 post ischemia. Animals were anesthetized, sacrificed by transcardiac perfusion after completion of the study, at day 35 post ischemia. Brains were removed for further ex vivo analyses. The timeline of the experiment design is summarized in Figure 1.

12,methods3,"  Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)o) and reperfusion  A total of N = 22 male C57BL/6J mice, 3-4 months, old were subjected to a 30 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)o) with partial reperfusion at day 0 (Figure 1, Figure S1), as previously described with minor changes 36,37. Briefly, animals received an i.p. injection of 0.04 mg Fentanyl/4 mg Midazolam/1 g bodyweight (Fentanyl: RotexMedica, Trittau, Germany; Midazolam: Ratiopharm, Ulm, Germany) and were anaesthetised with 4% v/v Isoflurane/O2 (Abbott Animal Health) and maintained with 2% v/v Isoflurane/O2. Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C with a heating plate system. The regional cerebral blood flow (cerebral blood flow (CBF)) was monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry (Periflux System 5000, Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) during the entire procedure to ensure successful occlusion and reperfusion (Figure S1).",3dd87e46-f862-477b-8049-97940525601b
13,methods4," To do so, the laser Doppler probe (PH07-5, Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) was directly fixed on the skull above the cortical area perfused by the middle cerebral artery (middle cerebral artery (MCA)) and the signal was recorded with PeriSoft software (Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden).  Middle cerebral artery occlusion was achieved by introducing a silicone-coated 7-0 middle cerebral artery (MCA)O monofilament (diameter with coating 0.19 ± 0.01 mm) (Doccol Corporation, MA, USA) into the distal common carotid artery (common carotid artery (CCA)), following then the internal carotid artery upwards to the middle cerebral artery. Success occlusion induced the Doppler signal to drop by at least 80 % of the baseline signal followed by partial reperfusion. The monofilament was fixed for 30 minutes before withdrawal. Right after surgery, all animals received subcutaneously Buprenorphin (0.05-0.1 mg/kg bodyweight) (Indivior, Berkshire, UK) for pain relief.",475a49f1-047e-43ec-9026-7da45a08a2d6
14,methods5," Mice were controlled and weighted daily during the first week, and then once a week until the end of the experiment. Exclusion criteria were: (i) absence of lesion on the T2w-weighted MR images on day 1 post ischemia, (ii) edema volume exceeding the cortical and striatal tissues, and (iii) extreme weight loss (> 20% of the initial weight).  Hydroxytyrosol diet  The hydroxytyrosol diet contained 0.03 gm% hydroxytyrosol resulting in an estimated daily HT intake of 45 mg/kg body weight daily HT intake (Seprox Biotech, Murcia, Spain). Calahorra et al. (2019) published individual food intake of the HT diet and change in body weight after stroke 34. Food intake decreased within the first week post ischemia but increased again afterwards.  Composition of both control and HT diets included 24.0% kcal protein, 15.0% kcal fat and 61.0% kcal carbohydrates (Research Diet Services B.V., Wijk bij Duurstede, The Netherlands), as previously reported 34,38,39.  Diets were stored at -20 °C until use.",39c27a0c-fa67-4ef9-89c4-2e17ef8cec52
15,methods6,"  Behavioural testing  Open field, grip test, rotarod, and pole tests were performed to evaluate the effects of a HT-enriched diet on motor and cognitive dysfunctions after ischemia. The four behavioural tests were carried out prior to tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)o and at days 7, 14 and 30 post ischemia as indicated in Figure 1.  Open field  The open field test allowed for the assessment of behaviour and locomotor activity by recording free movements of a mouse. The open field maze consists of a squared chamber (40 cm (length) × 40 cm (width) × 25 cm (height)) made of non-porous plastic placed in a quiet and free of clue environment. The mouse is placed in the middle of the maze and can freely move for 10 min. Locomotion was automatically recorded using EthoVision XT15 (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands) video tracking system attached to a pole above the field.",91a953f5-ce24-4591-9a86-a7afc869a0d8
16,methods7,"  Grip strength test  The grip strength test allows assessing grip strength of a mouse using a grip strength meter (Grip-Strength Meter, 47200, Ugo Basile, Italy) to determine forelimb and also total limb (fore- and hindlimbs combined) muscle strength.  The grip strength meter is arranged horizontally on the table. The mouse is able to grasp the grip trapeze with the forepaws or the grid with both fore- and hind paws while the experimenter holds the tail. The mice are pulled backwards until the grip is released. The test is repeated five consecutive times. The average of the peak force (in gf) is calculated from the last three trials.  Rotarod  The rotarod (ITC LifeScience Inc., Woodland Hills, CA, USA) test is used to evaluate the motor coordination of rodents. In this test, a mouse is placed on a rotating rod (3 cm in diameter) suspended 30 cm above the protected-rotarod apparatus floor. The mouse is placed on the rod and left to acclimatize for 30 s.",ea9a62aa-10ab-4d3e-a1c2-030c2ddb91b7
17,methods8," Then, the rotarod is turned on to accelerate in 300 s from 4 to 40 rpm. The trial is complete when the mouse falls down. The test is repeated five consecutive times. The time spent on the cylinder (in seconds) and the covered distance (in centimetres) were automatically recorded for each trial. The average values are calculated from the last three trials. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA indicated no treatment, time, or interaction significant effect on run distance. Results are reported in Figure S11.  Pole test  The pole test is a general test to assess motor functions. The mouse is placed head upward just below the top of a vertical pole (diameter 2.5 cm; height 60 cm) and then allowed to descend into their home cage. Each trial is recorded using EthoVision XT15 (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands) to manually measure the time needed to reach the floor. This procedure is repeated five times but only the last three trials are used for calculation.",c1b5d061-51fc-4bfb-aaa4-867dc6648cf5

[18F]DPA-714 PET imaging  [18F]DPA-714 was prepared as previously described 40 with a > 99% radiochemical purity. [18F]DPA-714 PET scans were acquired on a high-resolution small animal PET scanner (32 module quadHIDAC, Oxford Positron Systems Ltd.).  Once anaesthetized (induction: 5% v/v isoflurane/O2), mice were cannulated using a 26G catheter (Vasculon Plus, BD, Heidelberg, Germany) connected to polyethylene tube filled with NaCl. Then, mice were injected 12 ± 3.9 MBq of [18F]DPA-714 tracer and kept under anaesthesia (1.5% v/v isoflurane/O2) in a warmed environment for 45 minutes. The PET scan was acquired from 45 to 60 minutes post injection.",7982b15d-2395-4e35-a46b-071663833997

Spatial resolution is of 1.07 mm with uniform resolution over the entire field of view (FOV) (280 mm axial length, 165 mm diameter). After the PET scan, the animal bed was transferred in the computed tomography CT scanner (Inveon, Siemens Medical Solutions) for anatomic co-registration with the PET image. Three molecular sieve spheres (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) were rinsed in radiotracer solution and taped on the extremities of the bed (two on the left side and one on the right side). Those landmarks are both visible on PET and CT images and used for co-registration.",29986bc5-aab4-4ece-9231-974287018358

21,methods12," Then, T2w-MR images from day 1 post ischemia were co-registered with all the PET-CT scans to visualize spatio-temporal distribution of [18F]DPA-714 tracer and quantify the regional uptake.  Besides, co-registered T2w-MR images were segmented using a modified atlas-based thresholding approach 43 to delineate the infarcted region at days 1, 3 and 7 post ischemia. Briefly, an atlas-based right hemisphere volume of interest (volume of interest (VOI)) was segmented using a threshold of the mean intensity + 2.5 * standard deviation (sd) of the atlas-based contralateral striatum.  The percentage of radiotracer uptake per millilitre (%ID/mL) was assessed for all time points using the infarct volume defined on the T2w-MR image from day 1 and the atlas-based contralateral striatum volume of interest (VOI) (previously adjusted to the T2w-MR images).",c862523e-b07a-46f9-89ec-8ba693575d13

Also, HT did not affect recovery of the cerebrovascular parameters, including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and cerebral blood flow (CBF).  Altogether, our data indicated that a prolonged dietary intervention with HT, as a single component of the Mediterranean diet, induces molecular changes that may improve stroke outcomes. Therefore, we support the use of the Mediterranean diet as a multicomponent therapy approach after stroke.",e2032bed-7180-48f1-93dd-9b4aecf83ef9

Similarly, T2w-Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined edema volumes on day 7 (p < 0.001 for both groups) were significantly smaller compared to day 3 post ischemia (Sidak's post hoc test).  No treatment effect was observed on the mean T2w-MR edema volume for each time point (Figure 2). Importantly, edema volumes on day 1 were comparable between the two groups (Sidak's post hoc test, p = 0.80).

To investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of HT, we characterized the Iba-1+ cells population co-expressing CD163, a general anti-inflammatory marker (Figure 8C). We observed a significant treatment effect on the number of Iba-1+CD163+ cells (Figure S7B), indicating that HT may increase the number of anti-inflammatory microglia/macrophages at late time points.

Hydroxytyrosol, the main phenolic compound of the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)O, is well-known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, protecting vascular health 47. In this context, HT dietary intervention seems a promising multifaceted approach to prevent but also to slow down the progression of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory, cerebrovascular and functional outcomes after dietary treatment with HT in the post ischemic phase. HT strongly increased numbers of Iba-1+ microglia/macrophages population also expressing CD163 (anti-inflammatory marker) within the infarct region, inducing a slight increase in Translocator protein (TSPO) expression not detected by [18F]DPA-714 PET.",6921d7a3-2a35-4d42-8590-4cefc6d0451c
48,discussion1,"  Interestingly, HT improved strength recovery within the first two weeks while no treatment effect was observed on the selected in vivo imaging parameters. Overall, we showed that a prolonged dietary intervention with HT modulated the glial response and enhanced muscle recovery during the post ischemic phase.  Edema  Anti-inflammatory olive oil phenols have been considered as neuroprotective nutraceuticals usable in ischemic brain injury prevention. Mohagheghi et al. (2010) investigated the impact of dietary VOO on brain infarct and showed that 1-month pretreatment reduced infarct volume in rats 48. The same protective effect was observed with olive leaf extract 49 containing HT.  Here, T2w-MR imaging was used to delineate the infarct area following the method previously reported 43,50. No treatment effect was observed on the T2w-MR edema volume.",9aeb8c8f-fa80-4224-bf4d-4249afc2a9cc
49,discussion2," While VOO and hydroxytyrosol administrations prior ischemia are able to decrease infarct volume, our data suggested no therapeutic effect of HT within the first week on infarct size.  Similarly, cytotoxic edema was identified by enhanced hyperintense signals on DW images. Our results also indicated no treatment effect on the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value over time. While pretreatment with HT-containing virgin olive oil strongly reduced brain free water content after middle cerebral artery (MCA)o in rats 51, HT as a therapy does not show any protective effect on edema and/or water compartmentalization after stroke.  Vascular parameters  Vascular endothelial cells are central players in the inflammatory cascade. Under physiological conditions, they regulate blood flow and control vessel permeability.",b83c5c97-c4d3-453a-a8a7-9d0e8904c751
50,discussion3," Following stroke, endothelial cells are activated by a plethora of signalling molecules, leading to a decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF), increased vessel-wall leakage and subsequent infiltration of PNS immune cells at the site of inflammation. HT, as an antioxidant, has been reported beneficial against vascular diseases by improving endothelial functions 52. In in vitro models, HT suppressed inflammatory angiogenesis by inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation 27 and promoting apoptosis 53,54.  In our study, we did not detect any treatment effect on cerebral blood flow (CBF). In a recent paper, Calahorra et al (2019) indicated that HT-fed mice had increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the right hippocampus and left cortex at days 7 and 35 post ischemia compared to control mice. However, the authors did not measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) within the infarct region.  Additionally, we used nitric oxide (NO) as a peripheral marker to assess vascular tissue at day 35 post ischemia.",56e95ae7-5627-43e1-8f7f-9c7eab5da6ca
51,discussion4," Lausada et al. (2015) showed that extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption prior and after experimental stroke was protective against iNOS activation in the penumbral region within the first days post ischemia (73). In our study, we did not observe any treatment effect on NO levels, as previously reported by Calahorra et al. (2019) 34. The peak of iNOS expression was observed within two weeks post ischemia but resolved after one month post ischemia (71,72), which may explain why we did not observe any effect at day 35 post ischemia.  Anti-inflammatory properties  Stroke causes a strong inflammatory reaction within infarct and peri-infarct areas involving heterogeneous immune cell populations 55,56. Observations indicated that microglia/macrophages and astrocytes actively modulate the inflammatory cascade at different stages of the disease 56,57.",b4a60a2e-242e-4e3f-94cf-b52bccd16458
52,discussion5," They are initial responders to injury and contribute to cognitive deficit/recovery at later stages, depending on their activation state, ranging from a more pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state, modulating both neuronal cell death and tissue restoration, respectively 58,59.  Translocator protein (Translocator protein (TSPO)) PET imaging provides a non-invasive method to repeatedly access neuroinflammation/glial activity through the disease time course 55,60-62. Translocator protein (TSPO) is expressed at low level under normal physiological conditions while its expression increases in activated glial cells in response to brain injury 63. In a rat stroke model, [18F]DPA-714 (Translocator protein (TSPO)) signal within the infarcted area peaked around day 10-14 post ischemia, a signal mostly induced by microglia/macrophages 64 while a greater astrocytic contribution to the signal was observed at latter time points.",733bbcae-f359-41b4-91a7-51611ee74926
53,discussion6," Therefore, Translocator protein (TSPO) expression by microglia/infiltrating macrophages and astrocytes seems to be spatiotemporally dependent 62,64-66. However, its differential expression pattern and precise function in inflammatory conditions remain unclear.  The impact of HT on immune cells is still sparsely explored 34. Here, we showed that HT drastically increased the number of Iba-1+ cells (microglia/macrophages) within the infarcted brain area at day 35 post ischemia without any effect on the contralateral hemisphere. No significant difference was observed in F4/80 expression, a marker mostly upregulated in macrophages and at a low level in resting microglia, indicating that HT might preferentially stimulate the proliferation of microglial cells. However, further studies are needed to further characterize HT induced changes in the glial compartment at earlier time points. As a first indication, increased Iba-1 and CD68 immunoreactivity was also observed at day 7 post ischemia.",d65b46ae-c455-42da-ba58-488e168b40cf
54,discussion7,"  The accumulation of those numerous cells could not be detected by using [18F]DPA-714 (Translocator protein (TSPO)) PET imaging while a positive correlation was observed between the amount of Iba-1+ area and radiotracer uptake. Immunoreactivity is the gold standard to validate in vivo PET imaging due to its higher sensitivity. Our Translocator protein (TSPO) immunohistochemistry (IHC) data indicated a two-fold increase in Translocator protein (TSPO) expression (going from 1% to 2% Translocator protein (TSPO)+ area) in HT-fed mice while no significant changes were observed in Translocator protein (TSPO)-PET and WB. The detection of these changes presumably lies beyond the sensitivity of the PET technique. Additionally, small changes could also be hidden by partial volume effects (due to high uptake observed in surrounding glands and fatty tissues), the low number of animals and/or the inherent differences in quantification methods (2D vs. 3D).",9afcff79-f8b2-4d81-b89f-fbb9d841f027
55,discussion8," Further studies are needed to characterize HT induced changes in the glial compartment on a tissue level at earlier time points after stroke.  In a previous study, we investigated the neurorestorative efficacy of a dietary approach on Translocator protein (TSPO) expression as well 46. Results indicated that in vivo DPA-714 PET was able to detect therapy effect on Translocator protein (TSPO) expression at late time points. However, the diet used in the latter study was a multicomponent diet that might induce a stronger therapeutic effect compared to our single component diet. Thus, we hypothesise that the dynamic range of changes on Translocator protein (TSPO) expression induced by a HT diet might be hidden by the stroke effect and PET sensitivity. HT slightly stimulates Translocator protein (TSPO) overexpression on a tissue level.",4692c750-5341-44c4-80b1-896a11d97720
56,discussion9,"  To our knowledge, it remains unclear if a larger Iba-1+ cell population is more beneficial than resting microglial cells at late stages, while “active-shaped” microglia indicated homeostatic imbalance. Here, our results indicated that there was no benefit from late “activated” microglial on stroke outcomes. However, Lartey et al. (2014) demonstrated a positive correlation between three microglial related proteins (Translocator protein (TSPO), CD11b and CD68) and motor function (rotarod) over the first 22 days following stroke in mice 67, indicating that better motor outcome is associated to increased microglial activity and/or number.  We further characterized the Iba-1+ cell populations and the inflammatory environment by assessing the expression level of common markers. CD163 gene expression was similar in both groups as its fluorescence intensity, suggesting that the apparent increase in CD163 in the HT group was related to the overall increase in Iba-1+ cells.",b93a8f6c-c769-4065-83f3-21e0dfda43f8
57,discussion10," Moreover, the increased number of Iba-1+(CD163+) cells in the HT-fed group may partly explain the increase in Arg1 and Il-1β gene expression. Overall, our results supported the potential anti-inflammatory effect of HT during the post ischemic phase, indicated by higher expression of anti-inflammatory markers, while no clear-cut effect was observed. Future investigations should focus on a more extensive evaluation of the anti- and pro-inflammatory microglial polarization markers using a dedicated study design and appropriate techniques (scRNA and spatial transcriptomics) to conclude on the potential immunomodulatory effect of HT.  Cellular and scarce preclinical studies further support the anti-inflammatory properties of HT 22,30,68. Among others, the mechanisms by which HT is able to prevent and counteract inflammation include reducing oxidative stress and free radical production 30.",d86b33f9-b072-4baf-9a71-a56a56584bb7
58,discussion11," Pretreatment with HT was shown to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and iNOS genes expression in LPS challenged J774 murine macrophages 30 while no effect was observed when HT was added 12 hours after LPS. Besides, HT pre-cultured RAW264.7 murine macrophages cells also showed that HT decreased NO, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α 23 in a concentration-dependent manner. In a mouse model of systemic inflammation, pretreatment with HT also reduced COX-2 and TNF-α 29.  Altogether, these studies support the preventive rather than the curative effects of HT on the inflammatory cascade. Accordingly, the famous PREDIMED clinical study reported the preventive effect of the Mediterranean diet against stroke and cardiovascular events 26 while its therapeutic effect has been scarcely investigated.",28d1f5c2-342a-4531-9cbb-66a9a9e496d6
59,discussion12," We do believe that HT, as a single component diet, has a weaker effect than a multicomponent diet containing other Mediterranean components. As stated before, in our previous work, we investigated the therapy effect of a multicomponent diet on stroke outcomes and reported significant effects on brain inflammation 46. Therefore, we do support the use of the Mediterranean diet as a therapeutic approach since HT, as a single component, already showed interesting modulatory effects on stroke outcomes.  Antioxidant properties  The generation and release of oxygen free radicals (radicals (reactive oxygen (ROS)) increase in acute disease is leading to high oxidative stress, associated with increased cellular death, blood-brain barrier disruption and inflammation 69.  One of the main beneficial health effects of HT was so far related to its radicals (reactive oxygen (ROS)-scavenging properties and its ability to activate endogenous antioxidant systems.",0067386b-27ce-4dc8-b525-66c73f2fa92f
60,discussion13," The potential antioxidant effect assessed by the level of the lipid peroxidation biomarker thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)) in serum did not indicate a significant difference between treatment groups at day 35 post ischemia. We suppose that release of radicals (reactive oxygen (ROS)/radicals (reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) is an early process that is already resolved at the late stages of the disease 34,70.  Limitations of the study  First, the therapeutic efficiency is dependent on the dietary intake. Within the first week, the animals reduced their food intake and lost weight. Therefore, the potential acute therapeutic effect of HT on oxidative stress and inflammation could be underestimated within the first week.  The sample size was calculated based on a previous study where we investigated the therapeutic effect of a dietary approach on [18F]DPA-714 tracer uptake in ischemic mice.",f7db8602-57d6-4074-9518-fb98d078f114
61,discussion14," Moreover, the same groups were used to perform MR imaging and behavioural tests. Due to the large variability between animals in behaviour, the statistical power of the different tested parameters is below 0.80. Post-analysis of the data indicated that statistical power for the velocity assessed by the pole test and strength were of 0.84 and 0.71, respectively. However, the statistical power was on the low side for rotarod and open field, with 0.36 and 0.63 respectively. Therefore, the protective potential of HT on cognition and motor functions might be under- and/or overestimated. In our study, we showed that a prolonged HT treatment in the post ischemic phase improved forepaw strength recovery (power: 0.71). This finding was supported by previous stroke studies 55, 72, that observed improved motor functions after a single injection of HT in a 120 min tmiddle cerebral artery (MCA)o rodent model 55 and improved forelimbs strength in the acute phase of the disease 55.",0f81f35e-e4ae-4c8b-a7d0-3bc1b202dba8
62,discussion15," Overall, we concluded that HT could improve motor functions.  Conclusion  The understanding of how nutrition and in particular components of the Mediterranean diet may help treatment after brain injury has grown in recent years. In this context, we performed a longitudinal in vivo imaging study of the neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular and functional outcomes after a prolonged HT-enriched diet in an experimental stroke model. Data presented in this work indicated that HT has immunomodulatory effects by increasing the number of Iba-1+ microglia/macrophages in the post ischemic tissue. Analysis of inflammation-related markers expression supported that HT may favour an anti-inflammatory state. Further studies should focus on in-depth characterization of the pro- and anti-inflammatory markers expression using dedicated techniques (scRNA and spatial transcriptomics).",ef7f39b9-80d8-426e-be19-646bc4e28902
63,discussion16,"  Overall, molecular changes induced by HT, as a single component of the Mediterranean diet, were not detected by in vivo imaging while we did observe a significant positive effect on muscle strength recovery. Therefore, we do support the use of the Mediterranean diet as a therapeutic approach since HT, as a single component, already showed interesting molecular modulatory effects on stroke outcomes.
