0,introduction0,"Erectile dysfunction affects an estimated 18 million men in the US,1 with the disease burden expected to grow as the population ages. Erectile dysfunction is associated with reduced sexual intimacy and health-related quality of life as well as psychological distress for both the affected men and their sexual partners.2,3 If all affected men sought treatment, treatment costs in the US could reach $15 billion.4 Modifiable risk factors for erectile dysfunction, particularly among younger men (ie, age <60 years),5 are largely shared with cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) and include smoking, obesity, sedentary behavior, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome.6,7 In fact, erectile dysfunction is associated with future cardiovascular disease (CVD) and may represent an opportunity to identify and modify shared risk factors.",7ac437a4-c7bb-455b-ba38-5c94bcf0f432
1,introduction1,"8 Although evidence-based lifestyle interventions,9 including healthy dietary patterns,10,11 are offered to men interested in lowering their cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, it is unknown whether healthy dietary patterns are associated with lower risk of erectile dysfunction.  Studies evaluating the association between diet and erectile dysfunction are limited, and have focused on men with diabetes or prevalent erectile dysfunction. Several small- to moderate-sized randomized clinical trials report that multimodal lifestyle and weight loss interventions improve erectile dysfunction among men with significant cardiovascular risk factors.12 However, fewer studies have examined the association between a healthy dietary pattern and erectile dysfunction risk,13,14 and to our knowledge, no prior studies have evaluated the association between adherence to healthy dietary patterns and incident erectile dysfunction in men without diabetes.",203af753-f524-480f-8b1d-4de02e44abf4

Our study provides additional evidence that adherence to a healthy dietary pattern may have a protective association against erectile dysfunction beyond the established beneficial effects of weight loss and physical activity on erectile function, particularly among younger men.

Dietary patterns are measured with known error, which can lead to biased results; however, we used well-validated questionnaires to collect long-term dietary intake, and in general, we expect nondifferential measurement error to bias our results toward the null.

30,discussion8,"57  Conclusions This cohort study found an inverse association between healthy dietary patterns, such as Mediterranean and AHEI-2010 diets, and risk of developing erectile dysfunction in men. These dietary patterns emphasize the consumption of vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, and fish or other sources of long-chain (n-3) fats, as well as avoidance of red and processed meats. These findings suggest that men who are concerned about erectile dysfunction risk should be counseled regarding the potential contribution of their dietary practices. Future randomized clinical trials of healthy dietary patterns in men should include erectile function assessments to determine whether healthy dietary patterns can prevent or reverse erectile dysfunction.
