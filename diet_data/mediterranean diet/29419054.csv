0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design, Setting and Participants The study population were selected among the controls recruited in a multi-case control study in Spain (MCC-Spain). The MCC-Spain is a population-based multi-case control study conducted between September 2008 and December 2013 in 12 Spanish provinces: Asturias, Barcelona, Cantabria, Girona, Granada, Guipúzcoa, Huelva, León, Madrid, Murcia, Navarra, and Valencia (www.mccspain.org). The main aim of the MCC-Spain study was to evaluate the role of environmental exposures and genetic factors on some of the most relevant tumours in the Spanish population: breast, colorectal, gastric, prostate cancer, and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Cases were subjects from 20 to 85 years who had been diagnosed and histologically confirmed of any of the previous tumours and accepted to participate.",d9d29d6e-c3fe-4720-8314-bd7a0079b5eb
1,methods1," Controls were matched by frequency to cases by age, gender, and region, and were randomly selected from people enrolled in primary care centres within the reference areas of the hospitals where the cases were recruited, and were invited to participate in the study. The protocol of the MCC-Spain study was approved by the ethics committees of the participating centres. All participants were informed about the study objectives and signed an informed consent form. Confidentiality of data was secured by removing personal identifiers in the datasets. The database was registered in the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, number 2102672171. Permission to use the study database will be granted to researchers outside the study group, after revision and approval of each request by the Steering Committee. More details on the organisation of the project can be found online at http://www.mccspain.org.",8418c2c3-8b5f-4965-a8a4-04c55f8c5f88
2,methods2," More detailed information can be found in a previous article published by the MCC-Spain project research group [21].  The selection criteria for the MCC-Spain control group were: i) age between 20 to 85 years; ii) resident in the catchment area of the recruiting hospital of the cases during the 6 months prior to the interview; iii) not having a diagnosis of the tumours under study; and iv) be trained to participate in the study. The population of the present study included a subsample of 3640 healthy subjects with dietary information of the total of 4098 subjects selected as controls.  2.2. Data Collection Trained interviewers administered a structured computerised epidemiological questionnaire in a face-to-face interview. Information was collected on socio-demographic and anthropometric characteristics; personal and family background; occupational and residential history; and lifestyle factors including, among others, smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep, and physical activity.",895d9795-dad4-489f-9307-0be5598e5a72
3,methods3," Dietary data were collected through a self-administered, semi-quantitative, validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) [22].  During the interview, all participants in the MCC-Study received an Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) in paper form to be completed at home (self-administered) and returned to the interviewer in person or via mail (global response rate 88.8%). The interviewer explained and trained the participant to complete the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). This 140-item questionnaire was a version of an instrument previously validated in Spain [22] modified to include regional products. Collected information referred to eating habits during the preceding year and measured in servings and frequency of consumption each of the foods contemplated in the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).",1504c446-028a-4da7-92ee-7863fa131340
4,methods4," Moreover, some questions about general dietary habits were included in the questionnaire and were used to adjust the responses to the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) following the methodology described in Calvert et al. [23]. To facilitate the understanding of some items, photographs were used to assess the level of meat doneness.   2.3. Mediterranean Diet Pattern Adherence Indexes To meet the objective of this study, the following scores of adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern were evaluated: Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean diet score (MDS)) [11]. This index considers 9 food groups: vegetables, legumes, fruit, fish, cereals, meat, dairy products, monounsaturated/saturated fats ratio and alcohol consumption. The total score ranges from 0 (minimum adherence to a traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern) to 9 (maximum adherence);  Alternative Mediterranean Diet (aMED) [24].",0b4df47b-2618-4c4b-9d5a-f2996b3019b9
5,methods5," In this index the following groups of food/nutrients were considered: vegetables, legumes, fruit, nuts, fish, whole grains, red meat, monounsaturated/saturated fats ratio and alcohol consumption. The total score ranged from 0 (minimum adherence) to 9 (maximum adherence);  Relative Mediterranean Diet (rMED) [25]. The following groups of food were considered: vegetables, legumes, fruit, cereals, fish, olive oil, meat, dairy products and alcohol. The total score ranged between 0 (minimum adherence to a traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern) to 18 (maximum adherence);  Dietary Score (DS) [26]. This index includes the following groups of food: vegetables, legumes, fruits, fish, whole grains, potatoes, olive oil, poultry, dairy products with fat, red meat and alcohol.",b98cb97c-7242-4fd5-bcfc-ab842f347bcb
6,methods6," The total score ranged from 0 (minimum adherence) to 55 (maximum adherence);  Literature-Based Adherence Score (literature based adherence score (LBAS)) [20]: vegetables, legumes, fruits, fish, whole grains, olive oil, dairy products, red meat and processed meat and alcohol. The total score ranged from 0 (minimum adherence) to 18 (maximum adherence).    Table 1 shows detailed information on the characteristics of each of the Mediterranean dietary indexes used in the present study: the basis for its calculation, the groups of food or nutrients included, and the criteria for estimating the final score. The Mediterranean diet score (MDS), aMED and rMED scores are indexes that use criteria dependent on the study sample, in contrast to the DS and literature based adherence score (LBAS) indexes whose criteria, rations, grams or energy density are defined a priori. Regardless of the index used, a higher score indicated a higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern.   2.4.",1bb7b9bd-1a97-4b0c-b258-889b729bcbc4
7,methods7," Statistical Analysis Mean, standard deviation (SD) and the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles were calculated for quantitative variables, and the distribution of absolute and relative frequencies were determined for categorical variables. The participants were classified as having either low, medium or high adherence to a Mediterranean diet according to the cut-off points originally established for these indexes: Mediterranean diet score (MDS), aMED and rMED; and literature based adherence score (LBAS) by creating tertiles for the creation of adhesion levels of the DS (see Table 1). Pearson correlation was used to assess the relationship among the scores of the different indexes when they were considered as quantitative variables. A correlation coefficient R higher than 0.70 was considered as a strong correlation; from 0.5 to 0.7 as a moderate correlation; and <0.5 as a weak correlation [27,28,29].",629db358-89ac-4b78-b00d-63bf39c08016
8,methods8," When the study population was divided into low, medium and high adherence to a Mediterranean diet according to the criteria used for each index, Cohen’s Kappa coefficient was estimated to measure the concordance between the different indexes using linear and quadratic weighting to penalise classification errors among extreme categories [30]. Cohen’s Kappa coefficient was interpreted according to Landis and Koch classification: fair concordance when the coefficient was ≤0.40; moderate concordance for coefficients from 0.40 to 0.60; and substantial almost perfect concordance when the coefficient was >0.60 [31]. The statistical programme Stata v.14 (Stata Corp., LP, College Station, TX, USA) was used for the data analysis.   3. Results Of the 4098 healthy controls of the MCC-Spain project, Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) data were available for 3640 subjects (88.8%).",a23cba26-b9c8-4924-b0c7-9ab15998fac7
9,methods9," There were no important differences between the population with and without Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), except for academic levels (higher response rate for participants with high level studies than for those with primary school education or less, 90.4 versus 84.7%, respectively). The mean age of the participants was 62.8 years (SD 12.0) with an age range between 24 and 85 years. Men made up 50.9% of the whole sample and 21.3% had university level education. The average energy intake of the participants was 1898.3 Kcal/day (SD 638.8). Supplementary Materials Table S1 shows the main socio-demographic characteristics of the subjects included and not included in the analyses.  The mean scores of each of the indexes according their distribution by socio-demographic data is shown in Table 2. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the study population according to the level of adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern for each one of the indexes.",b1e2a3f2-8473-4e9c-b795-0fff86b636a5
10,methods10," The relative frequency of subjects with a high level of adherence to a Mediterranean diet varied from 22% (95% CI 20.67–23.40) when using the aMED index to 37.2% (95% CI 35.67–38.83) with the DS index. Similarly, a high variability was observed for the prevalence of population with a low level of adherence to a Mediterranean diet, from 24% (95% CI 22.64–25.44) with the rMED index to 38.4% (95% CI 36.81–40.00) with the aMED index. Interestingly, it was only for the DS and literature based adherence score (LBAS) indexes, scores independent of the study population, for which a similar distribution was observed—approximately one-third for each level of adherence. Confidence intervals for proportions to compare the categorical indexes are included in Supplementary Materials Table S2.  Table 3 shows the degree of agreement among the different indexes. A clear pattern of agreement among indexes cannot be observed.",48a41fe3-b620-4f6b-af23-2d061900af1e
11,methods11," The closest agreements are found for the lower adherence categories; and for these categories, aMED is the index with highest agreement with the rest of indexes: from 64.5 with DS to 78.2 with Mediterranean diet score (MDS). For categories with higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet, Mediterranean diet score (MDS) is the index with closer agreements; although they were always lower than 0.70. For the intermediate category, the agreement did not reach 50% for any index.  Figure 2 shows that, independent of the index used, a normal distribution was observed. Because the possible score range of the DS was higher (0–55 points) compared to the rest of the indices used, the distribution of the subjects in this index was less dense, and consequently, the variability of the score was higher.",99ca8b31-dad6-45fb-97c9-80a591e53825
12,methods12," The agreement between Mediterranean diet score (MDS), aMED and rMED indexes was moderate, except for Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and aMED for which a high correlation was observed, coefficient of correlation 0.75 (95% CI 0.74–0.77). The concordance for DS and Mediterranean diet score (MDS), and with the rest of the indexes, was moderate–weak (see Table 4). When the categories of adherence to a Mediterranean diet were considered, the Kappa coefficients among indexes showed a moderate–fair concordance; except for Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and aMED with a Kappa coefficient of 0.56 (95%CI 0.55–0.59) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.66–0.68) using linear and quadratic weighting, respectively.  4. Discussion Our results show a moderate or low correlation and concordance in the analysed indexes according to the evaluated studies of adherence to Mediterranean diet patterns. As such, a misclassification bias could occur according to the index used.",f79deb03-9259-43fb-95ae-33b8d1e645e5
13,methods13," However, we do not have the criteria to decide which index may be better. Therefore, this moderate-to-low correlation should always be considered among the reasons explaining the inconsistent results and variability between studies related to a specific disease and the Mediterranean diet since they can be motivated and explained in part by the use of different indexes to measure adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern.  4.1. Methodological Differences Between Indices The steep rise in the investigation of the health consequences of a Mediterranean diet pattern has resulted in the proliferation of indexes [32]. These indexes should be comparable with each other. However, disagreement is usual. There are several reasons that may explain the disagreements found: the lack of common criteria to develop the indexes, the type of foods or nutrients considered, the variability of the methods used to construct them, and the dependence or independence of the scores from the study sample.",11c2d57a-f211-46e8-956a-8b95f05f35e1
14,methods14," These points are further explained below. (A) Type of food, base components and/or nutrients included in the indexes. For example, classification agreement for the level of adherence to a Mediterranean diet among indexes is difficult when there are differences in the types of fat included. Differences include: i) monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio are included in Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and aMED and excluded in the rest of the indexes; ii) dairy products are included in the Mediterranean diet score (MDS), rMED, and literature based adherence score (LBAS) indexes but not in the aMED; iii) the type of meat included: all kinds of meat; or only poultry, processed or red meat; iv) cereals are only included in Mediterranean diet score (MDS), aMED, and rMED; however, the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and rMED included all type of cereals and the aMED includes only whole grain; v) nuts may be considered part of the fruit group as in the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) or rMED,",bf643c74-9a83-45fd-ba66-0345e8215a8f
15,methods15," or like an independent group in the aMED, or not considered at all such as in the literature based adherence score (LBAS) and DS.  (B) Criteria used to build the index. There are indexes based on in g/day (i.e., Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and literature based adherence score (LBAS)), in rations/day (i.e., aMED) or rations/month (i.e., DS) or in energy density (i.e., rMED). Regardless of how intake is measured, some indexes use scores with established fixed points (i.e., DS and literature based adherence score (LBAS)) and others use sex-specific medians (i.e., Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and aMED) or tertiles derived directly from the population (see next point). All these differences can be factors that make it difficult to observe a good correlation between the indexes.  (C) Dependence or not on the study sample.",525f1fbc-6d63-465b-ab9c-6338eeffd306
16,methods16," While the Mediterranean diet score (MDS), aMED and rMED are estimated using the distribution of some food and nutrients in the study sample, the DS and literature based adherence score (LBAS) are based on previously published a priori recommendations. This may explain part of the variability found among indexes. When Mediterranean diet score (MDS), aMED or rMED are used, it may occur that if the level of general adherence to the diet of a population is low, when having to classify the population in three levels, there are subjects classified with a medium or high adherence level to a Mediterranean diet when they do not really have it. For example, one participant was classified with a medium adherence with Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and aMED, but was classified with low adherence for the indexes that did not depend on the population (i.e., DS and literature based adherence score (LBAS)).",0242fc2d-0609-4fe1-8bf0-28490e86b51d
17,methods17," That is to say, the obtained scores using these indexes for an individual subject are relative and dependent on the characteristics of the rest of the sample, which makes their comparability difficult.    For all the above reasons, the indexes that have more elements in common are those with the best correlation and concordance. In our case, Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and aMED showed good correlation and substantial–moderate concordance depending on the Kappa used. In fact, differences between these two indexes are minimal and based only on food groups and what foods or nutrients are included in each group. On the other hand, despite having the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) index as a reference, the rMED has a moderate correlation and a moderate–low concordance with Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and aMED.   Bamia et al.",aed7b253-c920-4691-b33c-c19899156244
18,methods18," [32] evaluated the correlation between the Mediterranean diet score (MDS)_Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) index (reference index) and other indexes (Baseline Nutrition Credits4Health (Mediterranean diet score (MDS)_BNC4H); Mediterranean Diet Index (MDI_BNC4H) and Mediterranean Diet Assessment Score (MEDAS_BNC4H)), and also observed a low-to-moderate magnitude among indexes [32]. Those results are consistent with ours with the correlations and concordances found between the different patterns evaluated in our study also being moderate or low [17,32].  Despite sharing an a priori methodology, DS and literature based adherence score (LBAS) indexes have weak correlation and fair concordance. In this sense, DS is the index which presents the worst correlation and concordance results with the rest of the indexes and this could be explained, in part, due to a larger score range (0–55).",5d9ae153-9474-4875-a35b-9c217816f822
19,methods19," Moreover, DS’s method is the one that presents more differences in the number and type of foods and the characteristics those foods must have to be included in the food groups.   The literature based adherence score (LBAS) index appeared as a proposal to try to standardise all used indexes. This index does not take into account the sample distribution for either the assignment of a score for each food group or level categorisation of adherence to the Mediterranean diet. For our population, literature based adherence score (LBAS) presents better correlation and concordance with Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and aMED than with rMED, although this good relationship will depend on the population investigated and its particular characteristics.   As we have observed, the components included in a Mediterranean diet pattern adherence index can vary; consequently, the reliability of the indexes can be lowered.",58e21255-9266-4e8e-9fa4-88855a5bde01
20,methods20," Therefore, the contribution of each component in the indexes, the number of components, and the scoring criteria should be established in order to improve the agreement among indexes. We would consider it essential that all authors use indexes of adherence to the Mediterranean diet with the same characteristics. Thus, by improving these indexes the higher correlations could will lead to stronger evidence of the inverse relation between the Mediterranean dietary pattern and the prevalence of several diseases.  4.2. Strengths and Limitations As strengths of this paper, our results were consistent with those shown in the study by Milà-Villarroel et al. [17] in which they observed low correlations between the indexes. However, their study assessed concordance and reliability in a smaller and selected population of 324 healthy undergraduates at the University of Barcelona, compared to the larger sample and geographical variability of our study.",0de5231e-bac4-4255-a01c-a5215e19edf6
21,methods21," We worked with the control group of MCC-Spain study: 3640 healthy subjects from 12 areas of Spain between the ages of 20 to 85 years.   Nonetheless, we must mention the limitation of sources and strategies of the collection of dietary information, as it was done using a self-administrated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) previously validated for the Spanish population and referred to the intake during the year prior to the interviews [22]. Despite the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) not being a perfect method to estimate dietary intake without error, an alternative which lacks limitations does not exist; therefore, the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) is considered the reference dietary measurement instrument in nutritional epidemiology, and specifically, in nutrition studies, they allow adequate and replicable estimations of subjects’ dietary habits [33].",28fcf11b-b085-470d-8286-2647c7f8f94a
22,methods22," However, even though the a priori measurement instrument may be valid, the existence of information biases, particularly recall bias, cannot be ruled out, as well as the fact that participants tend to refer to the frequency with which they consider that they should consume the different types of food and not their current frequency, i.e., bias of social desirability [34]. Furthermore, it is necessary to emphasize that the Spanish Mediterranean diet could be different from that of the rest of the Mediterranean countries, due to the consumption of some local foods which are typical of each region. However, Spain is included in the Mediterranean zone and this food pattern is known as a Mediterranean dietary pattern.  5.",d47db66d-dd24-4e0a-a930-e89516b01a09
23,methods23," Conclusions The results of our study show that the existing Mediterranean diet adherence indexes measure the same concept, although they are based on different constructing algorithms and definitions in the food groups included, leading to a different classification of subjects in the different indexes. This lack of concordance may affect the analysis of the role the Mediterranean diet plays in the health of the population. Concordance between these indexes is moderate or low; therefore, it would be appropriate to reach a consensus on the construction of the indexes to improve the reliability of the results obtained by different indexes. For future research, our proposal would consist of defining which food groups or nutrients are included, and for each group, which particular foods are included, and defining a priori cut-offs because they are scores that do not depend on the general quality of the diet.",e5b79726-f58b-48f4-ab83-fbd931d597fc
24,methods24," Lastly, these definitions need to be according to the characteristics of the foods and nutrients of a Mediterranean dietary pattern.  ",a64d9672-1d28-4321-9a17-ca9a0c5aedf2
