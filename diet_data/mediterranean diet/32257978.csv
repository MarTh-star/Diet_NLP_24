0,introduction0," The incidence of metabolic diseases has been growing worldwide, together with overweight and obesity1. non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is thought to be the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome (SM)2 and has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease, representing a risk factor for cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation3. non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by a disturbed fatty-acid metabolism and hepatic lipid accumulation. However, the pathogenesis of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is not fully understood. non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development is thought to involve a genetic component as well as multiple simultaneous insults (“multiple hits hypothesis”). These hits include IR, inflammation, oxidative stress and nutritional factors4.",41981e07-f30a-42b4-9a54-c98fdff79a28
1,introduction1,"  Dietary habits are one of the most important contributing factors to the development and progression of IR and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)5. Hence, dietary strategies may also constitute effective treatments to attenuate IR and associated non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development. Dietary fats are of interest because not only the total amount of fat consumed should be considered but also the type and quality of fats6 the more so because bioactive lipids exert specific biological functions.  High caloric diets, particularly those rich in trans fats, saturated fats, cholesterol, and fructose-sweetened drinks, can increase IR and visceral adiposity and are thought to stimulate lipid accumulation in the liver, as well as, progression of steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD Activity (NAS)H)5.",faa56c83-e14f-4b7b-9b2c-2a40ab1b7e14
2,introduction2," Indeed, experimental studies showed that diets rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) can alleviate IR, intrahepatic triglyceride content and improve steatohepatitis7. A systematic review of clinical trials suggests that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) supplementation may be effective in the early stages of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but not in patients with more severe non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or NAFLD Activity (NAS)H8. In case of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), it is thought that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) could prevent non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development9 and may reduce hepatic steatosis involving specific biochemical pathways10. However, other studies have drawn opposite conclusions, because monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) consumption was positively associated with a higher fatty liver index11.",10c1c0e0-3bfd-4729-a602-5f1ccba8e43d
3,introduction3," Most of the studies that observe a negative relationship of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) consumption with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are cross-sectional studies in which the origin of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) is not considered. In a human study in which Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was used as a source of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, a reduction of liver fat (39%) was observed12. In C57BL/6J mice pretreated with lard-based HFD, replacement of lard by Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) reduced HFD-induced liver damage, paralleled by an anti-inflammatory effect in adipose tissue and modifications in liver lipid composition and hepatic signaling pathways13.",215efe1a-856a-492d-9896-e84f2c962419
4,introduction4," However, recently it has been shown that in a female C57BL/6J saturated fat/fructose /cholesterol-rich diet-non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model, the exchange of saturated fat for Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) did not avoid the progression of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)14.  In the past several years, the Ldlr−/− background has been frequently used as a model to study diet induced non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in obesity15. The Ldlr−/−.Leiden substrain develops severe NAFLD Activity (NAS)H/fibrosis in conjunction with pronounced dyslipidemia and IR. This model recapitulates metabolomics and transcriptomics profiles of NAFLD Activity (NAS)H patients16,17. Moreover, Ldlr−/−.Leiden mice develop NAFLD Activity (NAS)H and fibrosis without cholesterol supplementation, allowing the study of natural dietary fats and oils in a translational way.",e66301d8-3456-433f-96b6-f2501562c1b8
5,introduction5,"  On the basis that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake may contribute to an alleviation of the fatty liver grade in patients treated with a hypocaloric diet18 and can attenuate mild stages of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in C57BL/6J mice13, we tested whether Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)-based HFDs may prevent development of IR and more severe stages of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using Ldlr − / − . Leiden mice. We found that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s with both regular and high content of phenolic compounds consistently improved BW and insulin sensitivity but maintained liver inflammation and fibrosis.

All groups had a comparable BW at start. Mice treated with the different HFDs showed a similar BW increase throughout the study with significant differences to LFD which remained low. There were no significant differences in absolute BW between the olive oil treatment groups and the HFD-L group. However, calculation of total BW gain over the course of the study (Fig. 1A, right panel) revealed that the HFD-Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group gained significantly less weight than the HFD-L group (p < 0.05), and the same effect was observed for the HFD-OL group (p < 0.05).

The grey dots represent the genes without significant differential expression.  To gain insight in the specific effects of the various HFDs, we performed a DAVID analysis to identify potentially enriched biological processes using gene ontology (GO) terms. GO enrichment analysis revealed changes (up and downregulation) of several metabolism related differentially expressed genes (DEG) (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Interestingly, the metabolism-related differentially expressed genes (DEG) that were downregulated by both olive oils were genes involved in lipid-, cholesterol- and fatty acid-metabolism, as well as, lipid homeostasis (see Supplementary Fig. S3, middle and low panels).",25376058-4902-4476-be1c-d7a9e46a0211
32,results15,"  Besides, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)) enriched analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG) shared by HFD-L, HFD-Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and HFD-OL reveals the “Top-20-Results up- and down-regulated” GO-term enrichment analysis, of the predominantly involved biological processes and the concomitant further in-depth delineation of the involved biological process and molecular functions (Fig. 7). Based on the findings shown in Fig. 7 (middle panel), it appears that glutathione metabolism genes are among the top-10 up-regulated GO-terms in the liver of both olive oil treated groups and differentially affected compared to LFD. This may suggest an effect of olive oils on redox homeostasis. To better characterize this effect, activity of glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) enzymes were measured in liver homogenates.",8ad3d4d5-4158-4c36-aedf-49d29aae7c4d
33,results16," Supplementary Figure S4 shows that GPx activity was significantly reduced (**p < 0.01) in HFD-Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group compared to the other groups (panel A). No significant differences were observed regarding GR activity among the different groups (panel B). In addition, the hepatic nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) gene expression was measured (Supplementary Figure S5) and all HFD groups showed significant reductions (**p < 0.01) compared to the LFD group. In the case of the HFD-OL group, the most enriched GO-terms involve genes that are related to chemokine signaling pathway (Fig. 7, lower panel), possibly providing a rationale for the observed increase in inflammatory aggregates. Hepatic tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfα) gene expression was significantly increased (**p < 0.01) in all HFD groups with relative to LFD and consistent with this HFD groups also showed significant elevations in plasma TNFα levels (***p < 0.",e2bc8958-4d2f-45f6-a045-92cbb00502c2

The liver gene expression of Il-6 was higher in the HFD-Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group (**p < 0.01) compared to the other groups. No significant differences were observed among all dietetic groups regarding interleukin 10 (Il-10) liver gene expression (Supplementary Figure S7, panels A, B and C). In addition, the signaling pathway leading to NF-kappa B activation is among the top-10 significantly affected GO-terms, in both olive oil groups, when compared with LFD (Fig. 7, middle and lower panel). An analysis of microarray data showed several genes involved in inflammatory response, that were up-regulated, with a ≥ twofold change (p < 0.05) in HFD groups versus LFD group. In many cases, the increase was higher in olive oil groups, particularly in OL group (Supplementary Table S2).",e5f3b027-1cff-4b45-902a-9ecef9910b8f
35,results18," It is noteworthy to mention that the transcripts encoding for profibrotic cytokines Tgf-β and osteopontin were strongly induced by both olive oils. Particularly the latter showed an extremely pronounced induction specifically with both olive oils, i.e. log2 fold changes of 21.02 (HFD-Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) and 28.02 (HFD-OL). Finally, in both olive oil fed groups (Fig. 7, middle and lower panel), genes related to fatty acid metabolism are among the top-10 down-regulated genes, when compared to LFD, suggesting that fatty acid metabolism and processing is downregulated compared to LFD, which is consistent with the view that de novo fatty acid synthesis could be shut down under high fat feeding conditions.Figure 7 Predicted Biological Process GO terms identified using upregulated and downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEG), in HDL, HDL-Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and/or HFD-OL relative to LFD, after 32 weeks of nutritional intervention study.",25b7bcee-8853-4188-855f-ed52c17cf29e

38,discussion0," This study explores the effect of two Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s, with different content of phenolic components, to prevent HFD-induced non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using a female mouse model (Ldlr−/−.Leiden) that develops severe forms of NAFLD Activity (NAS)H and recapitulates features of the human pathology, when fed a HFD.  Importantly, we have used mature female mice because after reproductive age non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence is higher in women19. However, clinical and preclinical studies do not examine sex differences. In the case of preclinical studies, a possible explanation could be that females of the most frequently used genetic background for HFD-induced obesity analysis (C57BL/6J) gain less fat mass, develop a less pronounced metabolic phenotype and are more resistant to HFD-induced obesity and associated metabolic diseases20.

39,discussion1,"Leiden mice (6 weeks old) using a lard-based HFD comparable to HFD-L showed that male mice were more susceptible to the detrimental effects of HFD21. Moreover, older female mice (more than 18 weeks) were predisposed to develop lobular inflammation independent of HFD feeding, suggesting a role for hormones and other inflammation-modulating factors. In the present study we used 12–17 weeks old female mice, and we observed pronounced steatosis and inflammation development. Together, these studies indicate (i) that mature female mice lost their ability to adapt to metabolic dietary stress and can develop steatosis similarly to male mice, and (ii) that the development of liver inflammation in the present study may, at least partly, mediated by hormonal and other sex-dependent factors22.  Herein, we examined the effects of the three HFDs on BW gain and liver damage, using plasma transaminase levels as readout.",99b300be-b914-462f-bd41-c13dacc63706
40,discussion2," In a study using male C57BL/6 mice pretreated with L-HFD, an intervention with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)-based HFDs resulted in a maintenance of an obese phenotype, whereas L-HFD became slightly more obese13. However, another study using regular 12 weeks old Ldlr−/− mice23 showed that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)-based HFDs induced about the same BW gain than a lard-based HFD. The effect of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s on BW remains controversial and might be dependent on both gender and other constituents of the diet24. In this study, Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s mice showed reduced BW gain compared to lard-treated mice, in line with those studies reporting BW-attenuating effects13.  As expected, feeding Ldlr−/−.",e182c532-c83b-40d1-8404-4f2cb850b4d7
41,discussion3,"Leiden mice with HFDs significantly elevated total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, indicative of dyslipidemia and consistent with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients that display decreased liver LDL receptor expression and increased plasma LDL levels25. In line with our observations, Depner et al.23 also observed a significant increase in total plasma cholesterol levels in Ldlr−/− mice fed with HF-high cholesterol diet containing olive oil, when compared with mice fed a lard-based HFD.  Liver steatosis is associated with IR and IR is pivotal for the progression of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)26. It is unclear whether IR of the liver, adipose tissue or skeletal muscle contributes most to non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Ldlr−/−.Leiden mice fed a HFD-L, for 16 weeks developed IR and their pancreatic β-cells release more insulin to normalize plasma glucose values.",c83fd2de-a08f-45d4-9c0f-b7b5d120ed85
42,discussion4," Based on longitudinal clamp study in male C57BL/6 mice fed a lard-based HFD, white adipose tissue-IR develops first (after about 12 weeks) and liver-IR requires 24 weeks of lard HFD feeding27. This suggests that the observed protective effects of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s on IR, after 16 weeks of HFD feeding are likely mediated via beneficial effects on adipose tissue consistent with the effects reported by others and us28.  In this study, mice fed Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) were not in area 1 of the Fig. 3, indicating less IR and the absence of a hypersecretory insulin response. A recent report showed that HFD-Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) diets significantly improved the glycemic response and increased glucose sensitivity in male C57Bl/6J mice29.

43,discussion5,"Leiden mice developed lower IR than HFD-L and OL-groups could be due to the fact that these mice are suffering from a less severe condition of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) which does not manifest histologically but on molecular level (e.g. lower GPx activity indicating less oxidative damage in conjunction with higher Nrf2 expression) or because adipose tissue was less inflamed compared to the rest of the groups. We found no evidence for differences in systemic inflammatory mediators (including proinflammatory adipokines and cytokines)30 which could have constituted another mechanism that contributes to liver IR. In all, these data suggest that non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can become worse on histological level in the presence of a mild liver IR which is consistent with retrospective human studies showing that a substantial portion (> 50%) of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients does not suffer from IR31.",ed2f2eaa-c6d2-4483-8dbb-76801a1f97ce
44,discussion6,"  We observed that HFD groups developed more fibrosis compared to the LFD group, and treatment with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s did not prevent the development of fibrosis. Delgado et al. showed that a reduction in liver Gata4 expression can activate hepatic stellate cells (HSC)s leading to chronic fibrosis32. We observed a decrease in Gata4 positive hepatic stellate cells (HSC), indicating that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s based HFDs induce fibrosis through an activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) which is in concurrence with a significant increase of inflammation. The observed pronounced stimulation of osteopontin, an activator of hepatic stellate cells (HSC)s33, by Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and OL may also have contributed to the observed effect on liver fibrosis.  Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s, particularly those rich in phenolic compounds have notable amounts of polyphenols that can exert anti-oxidant effects13,28.",0395b4c9-54c2-40cb-9b39-eb87dd57b543
45,discussion7," Dietary polyphenols have been shown to exert hormetic effects, i.e. they display protective effects at low doses and increase the generation of ROS when administered at high doses34. In fact, antioxidant balance is very important to prevent ROS generation and oxidative stress in fatty liver disease35. As the dietary Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) content of our diets was high, it is possible that both Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) groups received too high levels of dietary polyphenols resulting in the rather unexpected increase in hepatic inflammation and liver fibrosis. It is known that the transcription factor Nrf2 regulates the adaptive response to oxidative stress by inducing the expression of antioxidant genes and preventing non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression.",b3887ba6-f2e3-4b8c-b670-a3bf6ddcb9b1
46,discussion8," Consistent with this, we observed a decrease in liver Nrf2 gene expression in HFD groups which may contribute to non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)36 and only the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group showed significant Nrf2 elevations indicating diminished oxidative stress in this group (consistent with aforementioned effects on GPx). The OL group did not show such effects and similarly to our study, detrimental effect was observed for chocolate preparations enriched with high amounts of polyphenols, where high chronic polyphenol consumption resulted in the aggravation of atherosclerosis37.  It has been demonstrated that dietary fat types reflect liver lipid composition and influences the progression of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by altering the liver gene expression profile13. Thus, we have analyzed the transcriptome of liver Ldlr−/−.Leiden mice consuming the different diets.",d1b15257-0eb8-48df-a11d-9d17bee4bd04
47,discussion9," The cluster analysis of microarrays showed a big difference in gene expression among HFDs, even between Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) HFDs. Mice consuming HFD-OL, thus highest phenolic intake, showed the largest amount of differentially expressed genes (DEG) indicating that the phenolic components of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) are responsible for the observed gene expression changes, and potentially also for the histological outcomes related to these changes. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) fed mice showed a downregulation of genes involved in lipid-, cholesterol- and fatty acid metabolism, as well as, lipid homeostasis suggesting a shut down of lipid metabolism and/or lipid processing. This may cause an imbalance of liver lipid homeostasis, contributing to steatosis, as observed by histology. The most up-regulated genes, in both Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) fed groups are those related to glutathione metabolism, indicating an effect of the oils on redox balance.",eee70d19-7b44-499b-ae67-6d7c0121f580
48,discussion10," Liver ROS overproduction may serve as a signaling mechanism to induce the expression of antioxidant genes to counteract the oxidative stress38. This could be happening in livers from mice fed Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)-based HFDs. This suggestion is further confirmed in the case of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group were a significant reduction of GPx activity indicates a reduced compensatory mechanism, suggesting that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) mice experience less liver damage because their aminotransferase (ALT) levels was also lower than those of HFD-L controls.  Cytokine plasma levels and liver gene expression corroborate the higher inflammatory state observed in HFD groups, particularly olive oil groups. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that genes related with chemokine and NF-kappa B signaling pathways are among the top-10 up-regulated pathways, particularly in the first position in HFD-OL.",a07558ed-a653-4d66-9f49-896471a5f6d7
49,discussion11," Marra and Tacke39 suggested that chemokines were directly involved in liver fibrogenesis. Moreover, NF-kappa B is involved in the transcription of multiple genes mediating liver inflammation, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma40. For instance, NFkB controls the expression of Ccr2 which promotes inflammatory cell recruitment in fatty liver and worsens NAFLD Activity (NAS)H development41. Besides the role of NF-kB pathway, microarray analysis showed the participation of other genes (Lcn2, Anxa2 or Spp1) related with inflammatory response, in the case of HFD groups. Finally, in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) fed mice, genes related to fatty acid metabolism are among the top-10 down-regulated genes (the top-5 down-regulated genes in HFD-OL fed mice). Because the lipid composition of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and OL is comparable, this suggests that the phenolic components affect lipid metabolism genes.",967749d1-106a-48c7-a091-5b126c895a4d
50,discussion12," This confirms that there exists an imbalance of liver lipid homeostasis, which may increase liver steatosis in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) groups.  FABPs are a group of molecules that coordinate inflammatory and metabolic responses in cells. Few studies have assessed the involvement of hepatic Fabp4 expression in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Greco et al. have described Fabp4 as being upregulated in subjects with high liver fat content42. The expression of Fabp4 and Fabp5 in the liver were correlated with hepatic fatty infiltration in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients43. In the case of lipid metabolism, it is known that in obesity, the impaired ability to up-regulate LPL by insulin exacerbates hepatic postprandial lipid load, thus causing hepatic steatosis. Therefore, LPL regulation is a crucial component in hepatic lipid homeostasis.",264e474a-ae71-46a3-8c0a-d9fd7851064c
51,discussion13," It has been shown, that as human non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progresses, Lpl expression is elevated, specifically in hepatic stellate cells (HSC)s44. Col1a1 and Mmp2 are genes involved in fibrosis processes. COL1A1 has been described as a potential biomarker of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/NAFLD Activity (NAS)H, as its expression is increased in liver of patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)45. In addition, it has been demonstrated in a model of Col1a1r/r mice that degradation of collagen-I is critical to hepatocyte regeneration and loss of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) during spontaneous recovery from liver fibrosis46. In the case of MMP-2, it is produced by hepatic stellate cells (HSC)s and plays an important role in liver fibrogenesis.",f7cb642d-8e9d-4282-9c21-8c3327b1bc10
52,discussion14," In a model of obese Zucker rats with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), it was found a positive correlation between ROS production, hepatic stellate cells (HSC) activation and an increase in the activity of MMP-247. In addition, it has been found that ROS released from hepatocytes regulates MMP-2 expression in hepatic stellate cells (HSC)s, mainly through NF-κB signaling pathway48. Finally, altered redox signaling due to generation of ROS is thought to play a pivotal role in NAFLD Activity (NAS)H development49 and the observed increase in fibrosis upon Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) treatment may be due to high ROS generation caused by chronic high polyphenol treatment. In a dietary murine model of NAFLD Activity (NAS)H, in which gene families involved in oxidative stress were analyzed in liver tissue, it was shown that members of the GPx family, mainly GPx3 and GPx6, where the most significantly upregulated genes50.",3d687fe1-6633-46fe-82cf-17a82d5fac88
53,discussion15," In our case, the observed increased expression of GPx3 suggests a compensatory mechanism that is triggered by enhanced ROS formation in the livers of mice fed Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s containing HFDs.  In conclusion, treatment of female Ldlr − / − .Leiden mice with extra virgin olive oil-based HFDs results in an improvement of weight gain, insulin sensitivity, and adipose tissue inflammation in absence of attenuating effects on liver steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. This rather unexpected finding may be explained by a fundamental difference in the plasticity between these organs: while the adipose tissue can respond with hyperplasia and expand, the liver is anatomically restricted with a limited storage capacity so that even lipids that are beneficial in nature may cause physical damage to cells when present in excess amounts.",8869e727-115b-4916-9678-a509ab4c0948
54,discussion16," Another possible explanation is related to the intake of relatively high amounts of phenolic compounds, which may, due to hormesis, cause an increase of hepatic ROS production. The polyphenols doses ingested by mice treated with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and OL, when extrapolated to humans, are comparable to the dietary intake of extra virgin olive oil of people in the highest tertile of olive oil consumption in the PREDIMED Study51. Different from a normal human Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption pattern, the mice of this study consumed Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s (and their polyphenolic components) chronically at every feeding moment. It is possible that this chronic consumption causes effects that would not have been observed when the same dose of polyphenolic compounds was consumed during one feeding moment.",85a8bef4-f923-45da-912c-4e491811621a
55,discussion17," Potential proposed mechanisms contributing to the observed chronic Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) effects are the upregulation of genes involved in liver inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress, as well as the downregulation of genes critical for liver lipid homeostasis. Future long-term studies that examine the role of dietary oils that have high content of antioxidants are warranted. ",56bb1b3e-922f-4e31-8a5c-5bedd9747001
