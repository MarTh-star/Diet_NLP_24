0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Participants  We performed a cross-sectional analysis of variables exploring gut permeability, low-grade endotoxemia by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and metabolic profile in HS (n = 20, 11 males, 9 females, aged 47.05 ± 6.41 years) and in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (n = 20, 12 males, 8 females, aged 51.54 ± 8.02) (study 1). According to the American Diabetes Association guidelines [16], impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was defined as a fasting blood sugar glucose concentration ≥100 and <126 mg/dL.  Additionally, we performed a secondary analysis of two previous reports in which Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was added to or not from a Mediterranean-type meal (studies 2 and 3) or to 40 g chocolate (study 4) [17,18,19].",af913891-f244-4b47-bc24-bf6c51cb0ba3
1,methods1,"  Study 2: In this study, we analyzed 20 healthy subjects (HS; 11 males and 9 females) who received a typical Mediterranean lunch including or not 10 g of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) in a cross-over design; there was an interval of 30 days between the two phases of the study. Clinical and demographic characteristics of HS are reported in Table 1.  Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was provided by monoculture (Itri area, Latina) and its chemical characterization is reported in Supplementary Table S1.  Study 3: In this study, we performed an interventional study in 20 impaired fasting glucose (IFG) patients (12 males and 8 females); clinical and demographic characteristics of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) are reported in Table 1. We randomized 20 impaired fasting glucose (IFG) to receive a typical Mediterranean lunch including or not 10 g of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) in a cross-over design; there was an interval of at least seven days between the two phases of the study.",5b3bbb42-68f2-448b-b977-fb84e0100103
2,methods2," The Mediterranean-type lunch composition is reported in Supplementary Table S2. Briefly, the Mediterranean-type meal for both studies 2 and 3 consisted of pasta (g 100), chicken breast (150 g), salad (80 g), bread (80 g), and apple (200 g) for a total of 894 calories; blood analyses were performed before and 2 h after meal intake.  Study 4: We analyzed the acute effect of chocolate intake in a single blind, crossover study including impaired fasting glucose (IFG) patients (n = 20), randomized to receive 40 g of chocolate spread mixed or not with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Blood analyses were carried out before and 2 h after the intake of 40 g chocolate (18.5% hazelnuts, 40% of cocoa, sugar, whole milk powder to reach 27% vitamin E over 100 g carbohydrates); the control chocolate had the same characteristics but without Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) addition. Every blood determination was performed blind.",557ddf8a-f70d-411f-89b4-9a3459c8afbb
3,methods3," None of the participants were receiving antioxidants supplements, statins, or dietary restrictions prior to the study. The study conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethical Committee of Sapienza University (Rif. N° 509/2016).  2.2. Serum Glucose and Insulin Assay  Glucose and insulin were analyzed in serum samples by a commercial ELISA Kit (Arbor Assay (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and DRG International (Springfield, NJ, USA)). Glucose values were expressed as mg/dl and intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 6% and 9%, respectively. Insulin values were expressed as μU/mL and intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 2.2% and 4.5%, respectively.  2.3. Serum Glucagon Like Peptide-1 (GLP1) Assay  A commercial ELISA Kit (DRG International) was used for the quantitative determination of bioactive GLP1 (7e36) and (9e36) levels in serum.",7e464eff-3748-4c16-b744-117bf9f35345
4,methods4," GLP-1 values are expressed as pmol/L and both intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were <10%.  2.4. Serum lipopolysaccharides (LPS) Assay  lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were measured in serum using a commercial ELISA kit (Cusabio, Wuhan, China). The standards and samples were plated for 2 h at room temperature into a micro-plate pre-coated with the antibody specific for lipopolysaccharides (LPS). After incubation, samples were read at 450 nm. Values were expressed as pg/mL; intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were <10%.  2.5. Serum Zonulin Assay  Zonulin concentration was detected in serum by a commercial ELISA kit (Elabscience Houston, TX, USA). Values were expressed as ng/mL; both intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were within 10%.  2.6. Statistical Methods  Categorical variables are reported as percentage and continuous variables as means ± SD unless otherwise indicated.",97399a53-9658-44cd-8be5-d771be92bbc0
5,methods5," Independence of categorical variables was tested by the chi-square test. Comparisons between groups were analyzed by Student’s t-test and were replicated as appropriate with nonparametric tests (Kolmogorov–Smirnov (z) test in case of non-homogeneous variances as verified by Levene’s test).  The cross-over study data were analysed for the assessment of treatment and period effects, by performing a split-plot ANOVA with one between-subject factor (treatment sequence) and two within-subject factors (pre- vs. post-treatment). The full model was considered, allowing for the assessment of all main effects and interactions. Pairwise comparisons were corrected by the Bonferroni test; results were expressed as means ± SD. Bivariate analysis was calculated by the Spearman rank correlation test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were carried out with GraphPad Prism9.1.0 and IBM SPSS 25.0.  3.",97bc9e83-92be-47da-8d21-25501570243a
6,methods6," Results  Clinical characteristics of the population are reported in Table 1.  At baseline, patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) had higher levels of blood glucose, insulin and GLP-1 compared to HS (Figure 1a–c); furthermore, patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) had higher blood levels of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and zonulin compared to HS (Figure 1d,e).  As previously reported [17] (Study 2), in HS meal intake was associated with a significant increase of blood glycaemia, insulin, and GLP-1 (Figure 2a–c). A trend of an increase of blood lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and zonulin was detected but the difference was not significant (Figure 2d,e). lipopolysaccharides (LPS) did not correlate with blood glucose, insulin, and zonulin; zonulin was not correlated with GLP-1 (Figure 2f–i).",aa7c3a86-97bd-4a3a-8fb4-f0c3881631e5
7,methods7,"  As previously reported [18] (Study 3), two hours after a meal intake containing Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) patients showed a less significant increase of blood glucose and a more marked increase of blood insulin and GLP-1 (Figure 3a–c) compared to impaired fasting glucose (IFG) not given Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Additionally, compared to impaired fasting glucose (IFG) patients not given Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), a significant reduction of blood lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and zonulin was detected (Figure 3d,e). Correlation analysis showed that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) directly correlated with blood glucose and zonulin and inversely with blood insulin; blood zonulin inversely correlated with GLP-1 (Figure 3f–i).",916721c7-d9e3-412b-93fe-ecfae3d70008
8,methods8,"  Similar modifications of metabolic profile, blood lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and zonulin as well as correlation analyses were observed in impaired fasting glucose (IFG) patients (n = 20) taking chocolate with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) added compared to controls (Figure 4a–i).  4. Discussion  The results of the present study demonstrate that, in impaired fasting glucose (IFG) patients, Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) counteracts lipopolysaccharides (LPS) increases detected after meal or chocolate intake coincidentally with zonulin lowering, suggesting that this beneficial effect may be attributed to improvement of gut permeability.  Previous studies reported that patients with metabolic diseases such as those with T2DM or obesity display low-grade endotoxemia consequent to changes of proteins implicated in intestinal epithelial cell permeability, such as the tight junction (TJ) proteins ZO-1 or occludin [20].",9adeee1b-0296-4324-94fa-d4565cc936f4
9,methods9," In accordance with these reports, we found elevated levels of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) compared to controls coincidentally with zonulin elevation, which increases gut permeability by disassembling the TJ proteins [21]; this finding corroborates the hypothesis that T2DM is associated with metabolic endotoxemia consequent to changes of gut permeability [5,22]. Low-grade endotoxemia has a negative effect on metabolic profile as documented by an experimental study showing that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) infusion increases glycaemia by negatively affecting insulin activity [5]; in accordance with this, we found that in impaired fasting glucose (IFG), but not in HS, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) correlated directly with glycaemia and inversely with insulin.",bca594d4-5132-40ef-9198-7d7ea1da1f40
10,methods10," In two previous studies [21,23], we reported that a meal intake is associated with low-grade endotoxemia in impaired fasting glucose (IFG) but not in HS but did not investigate the interplay between low-grade endotoxemia and the post-prandial metabolic profile or the relationship between post-prandial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and gut permeability. While the inverse relationship between low-grade endotoxemia and metabolic profile confirms previous data in T2DM [4,21], here we report that in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) intake of a Mediterranean-type meal or chocolate is associated with a coincident increase of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and zonulin, suggesting that changes of gut permeability may account for post-prandial low-grade endotoxemia.",9fd3c4a6-ba73-4d8e-bc5e-26211ada24ef
11,methods11," This finding would suggest, therefore, that in addition to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) translocation to systemic circulation via chylomicron biosynthesis [24], post-prandial low-grade endotoxemia occurs via a change of gut permeability.  In two separate studies we also reported that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) lowers low-grade endotoxemia, but the underlying mechanism was not investigated [21,23]; furthermore, we did not analyze if the positive effect of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on the metabolic profile could be related to a change of low-grade endotoxemia. The experiments conducted that adding Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) to a Mediterranean-type meal or to chocolate showed a coincident decrease of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and zonulin, indicating that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has a positive effect on gut permeability.",f7888c71-3568-47f6-9409-4fcaa09d9f5c
12,methods12," In order to investigate the underlying mechanism, we focused on GLP-1, which is increased by Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) administration [9,16,17], and is suggested to be implicated in the up-regulation of TJ proteins [23]; of note, we found a significant relationship between post-prandial increase of GLP-1 and the decrease of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and zonulin, suggesting GLP-1-mediated up-regulation of TJ proteins as a potential mechanism accounting for Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)-related improvement of gut permeability. These data extend our previous report in this field, indicating that the positive effect of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on metabolic profile may be related to changes of gut permeability and in turn to reduction of low-grade endotoxemia. In accordance with this, a coincident post-prandial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and glycaemia lowering along with an inverse relationship between lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and insulin were detected.",cb17f343-ac04-4476-82ed-82e09cc70550
13,methods13,"  The study has implications and limitations. We must acknowledge that serum zonulin is an indirect marker of gut permeability, and thereby further study is necessary to assess the relationship between Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake and gut permeability. We cannot exclude that zonulin may also be implicated in lipopolysaccharides (LPS) translocation to systemic circulation via mechanisms not related to TJ disassembling. Additionally, we cannot exclude that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) may lower circulating lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by interfering with chylomicron biosynthesis. The study has been carried out in a single center and in Caucasian patients; further study is, therefore, necessary to support the present findings. The study has been conducted in acute conditions, and further study should be carried out to assess the effect of chronic Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on gut permeability and low-grade endotoxemia.",1fb1a9e3-a35f-4251-95a8-e3764bc98b8d
14,methods14," Another limitation of the study is represented by the lack of further reference points (beyond 2 h from baseline values) that could have better described the post-prandial time course of the variables (glucose, insulin, GLP1, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and zonulin).  5. Conclusions  The study reports that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) added to a Mediterranean-type diet or chocolate blunts the increase of glycaemia by interfering with markers of gut permeability and low-grade endotoxemia in impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Further study is necessary to assess if a similar effect can be detected by chronic administration of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). ",333d9edf-7d84-4d2b-8e05-dc1f2bba72f2
