Each food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) contained approximately 130 items (except for the 1980 food frequency questionnaire (FFQ); 61 items), for which standard portion sizes with nine frequency choices ranging from less than one time per month to six or more times per day were provided. For this study, we used the data from 1984 (Nurses’ Health Study (NHS)) and 1986 (Health Professionals Follow up Study (HPFS)) onward because the expanded number of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) items was important to characterize dietary patterns.

Because tests for nonlinearity using polynomial terms of dietary patterns were not statistically significant, and because the patterns did not have intuitive a priori categories, we used each dietary pattern as a continuous variable and modeled risk per 1-SD increase. Cox proportional hazards regression models stratified on age and questionnaire cycle were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MM risk associated with the individual dietary patterns.

The primary analyses were conducted separately by cohort (sex); for secondary analyses we pooled the data and included sex as an additional stratification variable. We performed Wald tests for interaction by including cross-product terms for the given dietary pattern and sex. We conducted subgroup analyses to explore whether the associations between respective dietary patterns and MM risk differed by Body mass index (BMI) (<25 or ≥25 kg/m2) and tested for potential interaction by adding the cross-product term for dietary pattern and Body mass index (BMI) to the models.

Other dietary patterns were not statistically significantly associated with MM in men, and we did not find any statistically significant association of dietary pattern with MM risk in women.

Overall, current knowledge on the association between diet and MM risk is limited and inconclusive. Moreover, the previous studies had relatively small sample size and low response rates. Also, recall bias cannot be ruled out for case-control studies; recall of diet may differ by disease status, because patients generally have cultivated a sense of which foods are healthy or unhealthy.  In the present study, we evaluated the association of diet with MM risk using dietary pattern rather than individual foods or nutrients.",9144f0d8-a710-4862-ace4-a2a3d698ecf7
28,discussion2," Our finding of a positive association of the empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) in men is consistent with our hypothesis that immune-modulating or pro-inflammatory factors influence MM risk (13,53,54). Of interest, dysregulation of endogenous growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin also contributes to MM pathogenesis (12,15,16,55), lending plausibility to our observation of suggestive positive associations with MM risk for empirical dietary indices for insulin resistance (EDIR) and empirical dietary indices for insulin resistance (EDIR) and hyperinsulinemia (EDIH), which were derived to characterize the insulinemic potential of diet, particularly related to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, respectively (39). The latter associations also had apparent restrictions to men.",a198467d-afa4-46b5-9e4b-48eaaf139ed6
29,discussion3,"  Interestingly, we observed statistically significant and plausible associations of cross-classifications of empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) and obesity, and of empirical dietary indices for insulin resistance (EDIR) and hyperinsulinemia (EDIH) and obesity, with MM risk, also predominantly in men. Obesity is the only established modifiable risk factor for MM (23,56). Although we had limited power for those analyses, we consistently observed that individuals with the greatest dietary potential for heightened inflammation or hyperinsulinemia and also higher Body mass index (BMI) had the greatest increase in MM risk. Higher adiposity is associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and endogenous growth factors and with lower levels of circulating adiponectin. It is biologically plausible that low dietary quality in the setting of greater adiposity has synergistic adverse effects on MM pathogenesis.",7aad87a0-6029-4716-a7e2-801bbee84c82
30,discussion4," Another interesting observation was that stratified analyses generally showed a stronger positive association between inflammatory or insulinemic diets and MM risk in lean individuals compared with overweight or obese individuals. Although the interactions between these diet patterns and Body mass index (BMI) were mostly not statistically significant, these findings suggest that inflammatory or insulinemic diets may be a stronger risk factor of MM in individuals with lower adiposity.  The other dietary patterns that we examined in this study did not have a clear association with MM risk in men or in women. Previous studies have shown an inverse association of AHEI-2010, aMED, Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Prudent patterns, as well as a positive association of Western pattern, with major chronic diseases and certain solid tumors (32,33,57–61). Further, these dietary patterns were shown to be associated with inflammation (24,62).",409d4d9a-5b52-4066-b2b5-be4b7499f50f
31,discussion5," Thus, our null findings were somewhat unexpected and inconsistent with those for other chronic diseases. Reassuringly, our findings for AHEI-2010, aMED, and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) did not suggest an increased risk of MM, supporting that adherence to current recommendations of dietary patterns based on scientific evidence for the prevention of chronic diseases does not confer harm from MM risk. The reasons for the discrepancy of findings for the dietary pattern scores and for empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP), empirical dietary indices for insulin resistance (EDIR), and empirical dietary indices for insulin resistance (EDIR) and hyperinsulinemia (EDIH) are not immediately clear.",fd038513-cb40-4a16-a0ae-73c3c6294101
32,discussion6," The latter dietary indices were directly derived from food groups that are most predictive of biomarkers of inflammation, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia, respectively, and thus may more directly or more precisely capture the immune-modulating aspects of diet that are most relevant to MM development. Alternatively, more limited variability in the other dietary score variables, and possibly residual confounding by unknown or unmeasured risk factors, may have hindered detection of a subtler association of other dietary patterns with MM risk.  Unlike in men, dietary patterns did not show any association or trend in relation to MM risk in women, except that we found a statistically significantly positive association of empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) and empirical dietary indices for insulin resistance (EDIR) and hyperinsulinemia (EDIH) with MM risk among lean women.",cc1b536c-27f6-47f5-bba3-c3de8bc9458f
33,discussion7," The observed sex difference may be due to chance or to uncontrolled confounding by as-yet-unknown risk factors for MM that vary by sex. Alternatively, the findings may reflect true sex differences in physiologic effects of dietary pattern on the development of MM. In our cohorts, we have seen sex differences for other risk factors for MM. For example, both young adult and later adult Body mass index (BMI) were stronger risk factors for men compared with women (22). Furthermore, regular aspirin intake showed stronger inverse association with MM risk in men than in women (49). Overall, the literature is variable with regard to reports of sex differences in these factors and does not offer clarification of our present findings. However, we note that MM incidence is generally 40–50% higher in men than in women (7). With the present sample sizes, we had limited statistical power to detect statistically significant interactions of dietary pattern and sex.",d3cc7d70-4bf2-4a1a-a40b-e738cea33cc1
34,discussion8," Our secondary analyses pooling the data for women and men did not replicate the statistically significant findings in men. The present observation of sex differences for the dietary index associations with MM risk requires further exploration in larger study populations.  This study has considerable strengths. Detailed diet data allowed us to compute and compare a variety of dietary patterns to examine their association with MM risk. Further, repeated measures of dietary pattern were available over a long follow-up period, permitting an examination of the influence of timing of “exposure.” In fact, the associations for empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP), empirical dietary indices for insulin resistance (EDIR), and empirical dietary indices for insulin resistance (EDIR) and hyperinsulinemia (EDIH) appeared somewhat stronger for baseline measures than for the cumulative averages, whereas the associations were attenuated when based only on the most recent dietary assessment.",c0060a7b-5078-4951-922a-d5b197b12b84
35,discussion9," The latter observation may reflect an influence of subclinical disease on dietary habits, though the most recent dietary assessment tended, on average, to be approximately 2 years before diagnosis of MM. The findings may also suggest an earlier critical period for an influence of dietary pattern on MM development, although we did not have sufficient statistical power to stratify the analyses by follow-up interval to elucidate this further. Other strengths include the prospective design and the homogeneity of the study population that makes residual confounding by race/ethnicity unlikely. Several limitations also warrant attention. First, measurement error in assessing dietary pattern is inevitable. However, use of cumulative average of repeated measures may reduce the measurement error of long-term intake. Given the prospective study design, the measurement error is likely nondifferential.",68a84ae1-8625-46b9-86e9-44908d79a34c
36,discussion10," Second, although we adjusted for some known and potential confounders, we cannot rule out residual confounding by unknown or unmeasured factors such as family history of lymphoid malignancy (9,10). Lastly, our study population consisted of predominantly white health professionals, which may limit the generalizability of the findings if dietary pattern is correlated with aspects of race or ethnicity that also underlie its association with MM.  In conclusion, our findings show evidence that diets with inflammatory or insulinemic potential may play a role in MM development, with apparent restrictions to men. Our study warrants confirmation in populations with larger sample size and greater racial and ethnic diversity as well as in relation to risk of progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to MM.",33a8b779-48ea-4677-9268-8f28495fe969
