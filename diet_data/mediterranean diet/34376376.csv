0,background0," Adolescence is one of the stages where a large number of physical, psychological and emotional changes occur, the latter playing a key role in adherence to a healthy dietary pattern. Taking into account the above, this research reflects the objectives of developing an explanatory model of the incidence of attention, clarity and emotional repair on adherence to the Mediterranean diet and to contrast the structural model through a multigroup analysis based on Mediterranean adherence to this dietary pattern.

1,methods0," To this end, a comparative descriptive cross-sectional study has been carried out with 293 students from the third cycle of primary education. The instruments used were a sociodemographic questionnaire, the KIDMED test and the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24). ",2eb08c16-22cb-4ac7-bf93-720383b6a40f
2,results0," Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of each model developed. In this case it is observed that the total sample is made up of 147 boys and 146 girls. It should also be noted that 93 participants showed an optimal adherence to the Mediterranean diet, 166 showed an average adherence and 34 showed a low adherence to this dietary pattern.  The model develop for low adherence showed a good fit for each of the indices. The Chi-square showed a significant p-value (X2 = 77.699; df = 16; pl = 0.000). In this case, such data cannot be interpreted in an independent way due to the sample size and susceptibility of the sample, therefore other standardized fit indices have been used (Tenenbaum & Eklund, 2007). The comparative fit index (comparative fit index (CFI)) obtained a value of 0.949, the normalized fit index (normalized fit index (NFI)) showed a value of 0.925, the incremental fit index (incremental fit index (IFI)) obtained a score of 0.",f9f1e62c-4b04-4a76-a490-4055cfae56b8

Discussions  The present study reflects the influence of emotions on adherence to a healthy dietary pattern, in this case to the Mediterranean diet in adolescent students in the third cycle of primary education. In this case the platen research hypothesis is fulfilled, as the model equations reveal that having a low adherence to the Mediterranean diet reports worse associations between the emotional and dietary domains.",0ffde5d7-d08a-487a-ae7b-3e03639a2f4c
9,results9," The results obtained respond to the proposed objectives, which is why this discussion aims to compare the results obtained in this study with those obtained in other similar studies.  Students who show low adherence to the Mediterranean diet, a negative relationship is observed between emotional repair and positive adherence to a healthy dietary pattern. Results very similar to those obtained in the present research were concluded by Herren et al. (2021) and Melguizo-Ibáñez et al. (2022a); Melguizo-Ibáñez et al. (2022b), where Trigueros et al. (2020) affirm the existence of a process of emotional eating. In this case, this process consists of overeating unhealthy foods, such as pastries and sweets in times of stress or anxiety or negative emotions. In this case, research by Linswiller et al. (1989) states that people who mismanage their emotions tend to experience states such as anxiety and stress, leading to a process of overeating.",393a7cf4-8a08-466b-9ecf-f3c497eed3ff
10,results10," This may also be due to the fact that students may have received little emotional training, and are able to overcome such states through the process described above (Sabingoz & Dogan, 2019).  Continuing with the model developed for participants showing a medium adherence to the Mediterranean diet, a negative relationship with emotional clarity is denoted. Very distant results were obtained by Marchena, Bernabéu & Iglesias (2020), where Melguizo-Ibáñez et al. (2021) affirming that emotional clarity plays a key role in knowing the different emotional states that are experienced and whether they are beneficial or detrimental. Likewise, emotional clarity plays a key role with emotion repair as students need to understand whether a certain state makes them feel good or bad and thus recover from it if it harms them without engaging in excessive intake of unhealthy foods .",75bfe7dd-0c3b-4eb9-8278-aa3e82cd7fea
11,results11,"  For the model developed for students who show a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet, it is observed that there is a positive relationship with the three constructs that comprise emotional intelligence. Very similar results were obtained by Marchena, Bernabéu & Iglesias (2020) where they state that a healthy diet brings benefits on different personal dimensions, among which emotional intelligence stands out (Ubago-Jiménez et al., 2020).  Such behavior can be explained by the fact that an optimal adherence to the Mediterranean diet brings benefits on the physical and emotional self-concept, generating positive and satisfactory emotions in the physical and mental image of individuals (Zurita-Ortega et al., 2018; Melguizo-Ibáñez et al., 2022a; Melguizo-Ibáñez et al., 2022b).  Regarding the implications that this research offers in the field of health, it is the presence and importance of emotions when it comes to adherence to a healthy dietary pattern.",24b3df8c-cc68-450d-a635-ca8f92cd527a
12,results12," Likewise, the presence of negative emotions together with disruptive process that is detrimental to the physical and mental health of individuals. Several emotional states can originate a process of emotional overeating, resulting in a practical applications of this research can be extrapolated to the educational field, through an intervention program focused on emotional control and its impact on an active and healthy lifestyle (Ubago-Jiménez et al., 2020; Melguizo-Ibáñez et al., 2022a; Melguizo-Ibáñez et al., 2022b).  Limitations and future prospects  The present study reflects a series of limitations, which are described below. The first one is that since this is a cross-sectional study, it is only possible to establish the causal relationships of the variables at that time. In addition, the sample is made up of students from a very specific geographic area, so that it is not possible to establish generalizations in a wider area of the national geography.",b465ea83-56f8-45b0-8db3-ffa280777fc7
13,results13," Likewise, the study is exploratory in nature, requiring a future intervention to better study the relationships.  Focusing attention on future perspectives, it has been proposed to develop a longitudinal intervention program, where, through emotional education, the effects of these states on food intake can be studied.  Conclusions  The present study shows that attention, clarity and emotional repair influence positive adherence to a healthy pattern. Based on the different models of equations developed, it is observed that students who show low adherence to the Mediterranean diet have a negative association with the repair of negative emotions. Likewise, continuing with those participants who show a medium adherence to the Mediterranean diet, it is observed that they have a negative relationship with emotional clarity, while students who claim to have a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet show positive relationships with each of the constructs that make up emotional intelligence.",8128835b-8b16-49d2-b612-2513f96df9bd
14,results14," Finally, the data from the present research affirm that positive adherence to a healthy dietary pattern results in better understanding, clarity and repair of emotions.
