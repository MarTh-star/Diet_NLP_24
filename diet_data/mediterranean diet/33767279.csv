5,methods5," Participant groupings were randomly assigned by an associate in the department based on a computer-generated random number table.  Diet Intervention  Both diets aimed at moderate long-term metabolic improvement and restricted the intake of sweets and foods containing trans fatty acids. The participants were divided into two groups, and they joined separate diet management groups, where a professional dietitian recommended 7-day recipes. The LF group had less than 30% of total dietary calories from fat, less than 40 g of fat intake throughout the day and up to 10% saturated fat (21). They do not consume fatty foods such as fatty meats, butter, offal, fried foods, preserved foods, poultry skin, fish roe, shrimp roe, and crabmeat, and they increased the intake of cereals, vegetables, and fruits as appropriate (Supplementary Table 1).",527a878e-6440-4280-885e-8c18167a7381

In addition, the body mass index (BMI) was automatically read by an app connected to the instrument (kg/m2). WC and HC were measured by a fixed researcher using a soft ruler with an accuracy of 1 mm. WC was measured as the midpoint of the line between the lowest point of the rib and the upper edge of the iliac crest, and HC was measured as the horizontal circumference of the most prominent part of the hip towards the back. The waist-to-hip ratio (waist hip ratio (WHR)) was calculated as WC (cm)/HC (cm).",395c47e8-7666-46d6-8739-8a693fba8b47

20,discussion0," This study was the first to use the Mediterranean diet (MED) combined with a LC diet for 12 weeks of strict dietary management in overweight patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It also compared the effects of the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC diet and the LF diet on anthropometric indicators, reproductive endocrine levels, degree of IR and lipid metabolism levels in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); recorded the number of people who returned to normal menstrual cycles during management in both groups and investigated the degree of rationality and effectiveness of the two dietary regimens.  Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common gynaecological endocrine metabolic disorder in adolescent and fertile women. IR is a metabolic abnormality characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and it leads to compensatory elevation of body insulin levels and the development of HI, which exacerbates hyperandrogenaemia, anovulation and polycystic ovary formation (24).",66daf434-cddc-4d24-a3fe-08b5f6ed38a4
21,discussion1," Most patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are formally obese, and obesity is an important cause of IR in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Clinical management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is still mostly limited to pharmacological treatment. As research into the mechanisms of IR in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) progresses, including its effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and the warning of long-term complications such as cardiovascular disease and endometrial cancer, considerable attention should be given to lifestyle interventions as a safe, effective and closely related daily treatment management modality (25). As the first line of treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the management of dietary behaviour plays an important role in the efficacy of the disease, and no standardised dietary protocols are available at present.",93d1baaa-603d-43bd-b102-ec1dc3d02b99
22,discussion2," In an earlier clinical study, the average daily total energy intake of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was higher than that of the common people, and limiting their total energy intake ameliorated their weight, androgen secretion and insulin index (26). Subsequently, overweight patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a predominance of visceral adiposity, and they are evidently and centrally obese. In addition, adipose tissue secretes a variety of adipokines, including leptin, lipocalin, resistin and visceral adiponectin to promote the development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The formation of obesity is strongly related to the daily preference for high-fat foods (27). The development of obesity is strongly associated with the daily preference for high-fat foods.",ab5d3dda-9bc4-4959-aa41-80bf2a23b153
23,discussion3," Therefore, some researchers have developed a LF diet model with no energy restriction and a low glycaemic index diet model to compare the improvement of obesity and reproductive endocrinology in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and found that both dietary models improved obesity in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) but not reproductive endocrinology (28). In the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), IR plays a crucial role as a central mechanism for the sensitivity of body’s glucose metabolism, usually manifested by poor glucose tolerance and reduced insulin sensitivity (29). Therefore, controlling the level of carbohydrate content in the daily dietary intake of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) plays an important role. Jafari-Maram et al. found diets lower in carbohydrate and higher in protein and fat were not associated with overweight, obesity and cardiovascular risk factors (30).",2e0e9d4c-6e61-442e-9e14-7f0d5fcffec0
24,discussion4," In a meta-analysis of intervention studies in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) using an unrestricted energy LC diet model, LC significantly reduced body mass index (BMI), androgen and IR levels and improved lipid metabolism in eight relevant RCTs compared with standard dietary regimens (31). Thus, a LC diet is recommended. The Mediterranean diet (MED) model, a dietary model that has emerged in recent years, is based on a rich variety of plant foods, including a large number of vegetables, fruits, grains and cereals, legumes, nuts and seeds, with fat accounting for up to 35% of total dietary energy and less than 7–8% of saturated fatty acids. It has a refined broad framework for the composition of the diet, and it is widely used in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (32), but its application in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is less common. The Mediterranean diet (MED) model can effectively modify IR (33).",e963341e-0282-417a-85c0-b4a04f14ca05
25,discussion5," Therefore, in this study, we used the Mediterranean diet (MED) structural model combined with the LC diet model, which was compared with the LF diet model, to provide a 12-week dietary intervention for overweight patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) based on restricted total energy intake, and we found that at the end of the intervention, both dietary models had an effect on the anthropometric indicators of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), reproductive endocrine levels, the degree of IR and lipid metabolism-related indicators. The Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC group showed more significant improvements in weight, body mass index (BMI), WC, waist hip ratio (WHR), and BF% than the LF diet group.",2baae42c-10d5-4124-afad-11078793a263
26,discussion6," The primary issue for overweight patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is weight and body fat loss; therefore, the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC regimen is effective for overweight patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), surpassing the LF regimen to a certain extent. With regard to reproductive endocrine levels, TT, LH, and LH/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) all decreased to a certain extent in the LF group after the intervention, but the decrease was more prominent after the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC intervention. In addition, with regard to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and prolactin (PRL) levels, a slight change was observed in both groups. The decrease in these indicators is important for follicular development and the recovery of ovulatory cycles in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The decline in TT is particularly important.",8e2455b4-fc81-414a-acc6-9ccd7a6b5eed
27,discussion7," Hyperandrogenaemia, a representative pathological mechanism in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is a pathological increase in androgens that activates the earliest stages of follicular growth, thereby stimulating the growth of small sinus follicles, leading to the recruitment of small follicles and the formation of polycystic ovaries. Moreover, a high androgen level increases the expression of granulosa cell androgen receptors and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors, promoting granulosa cell and follicular membrane cell proliferation and cortical thickening, with ovulatory disturbances and secondary menstrual disorders (34). Therefore, a decrease in androgens would play a direct role in restoring ovulation. In previous studies, the LF diet alone did not significantly improve reproductive endocrine disorders in overweight patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (28), whereas the LF diet model in this study showed good improvement.",16f523d1-5828-4ccd-baf5-ac2670eadbef
28,discussion8," The present study controlled the total energy intake by setting the LF diet model, which had an important effect on the metabolic level to a certain extent. This result suggests that the restriction of total energy intake is important in the development of dietary intervention, regardless of the changes in the composition of the diet. Comparing the number of people who returned to normal menstrual cycles between the two groups, the return to normal menstrual cycles was greater than 50% in the LF and Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC groups (72.4 vs. 86.7%), with no significant difference between the two groups, indicating that both dietary regimens were effective in restoring ovulation in overweight patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).",360ff736-4ac5-48c6-9d02-54d940a3161b
29,discussion9," In the dietary regimen of this study, the LF group was set up with an average daily fat intake of less than 40 g, thereby significantly increasing the ratio of carbohydrate to protein intake compared with the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC group with regard to dietary structure. When comparing the reduction in the degree of IR, we found that the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the LF group was higher than that before the intervention, which may be related to the higher proportion of carbohydrate intake in this model. Therefore, the total energy intake and the total fat intake were controlled during the 12 weeks of the protocol, and the fasting insulin (FINS), HOMA-IR, and quantitative insulin sensitivity index (QUIKI) indices still showed a decreasing trend to a certain extent, indicating that our LF diet in the presence of calorie restriction can still alleviate the degree of IR, although the carbohydrate intake ratio was correspondingly higher.",89a60457-a0f6-4a79-b36a-df3dd81ffe03
30,discussion10," The results of a previous study found little difference in changes in blood glucose and HI-related indicators after a high-fat diet versus a high-carbohydrate diet, but the metabolic pattern shifted to impaired insulin sensitivity during the high-fat diet (35). This finding suggests that the intake of fat content has a profound effect on the IR status, which could explain the corresponding improvement in IR in our LF diet model. However, the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC group significantly controlled carbohydrate intake compared with the LF group. Combining the two dietary models, the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC group significantly increased protein intake compared with the LF group, whereas fat intake did not significantly exceed the standard diet (the standard for a LF diet is a total daily intake of <50 g, and the fat intake in this study was at 57.51 ± 6.56 g).",1105511a-7fc9-4a17-8fa9-230b66567108
31,discussion11," Therefore, the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC diet model in this study is similar to the high-protein (HP) diet model to a certain extent. In an earlier trial of a dietary intervention for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), researchers found significant improvements in anthropometric indicators and testosterone levels and a slight difference in lipid levels in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared with the standard ratio dietary model after intervention with a dietary model that simply increased the protein/carbohydrate ratio (36). In studies of metabolic-related diseases, calorie-restricted HP diet model can relieve hyperglycaemia and IR status by modifying intestinal flora (37, 38), and the results of the present study suggest that a similar mechanism may exist in the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC model.",8f66a74b-322f-4e05-ae45-96b79c802056
32,discussion12," Comparing the relevant metabolic indices before and after the intervention of the two dietary models in this study, the decrease in IR-related indices (fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS), HOMA-IR index, and quantitative insulin sensitivity index (QUIKI) index) and lipid profile (TG, TC, and LDL-C) after the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC diet intervention was significant compared with the LF group, which indicated that the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC diet model has an advantage over the LF diet model with regard to calorie restriction. The Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC group had an advantage over the LF group with regard to improvement in all polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-related indicators, which was also related to the difference in the specific refinement of food between the two groups.",c26a2082-be66-45d7-85eb-2662d5ff60df
33,discussion13," The Mediterranean diet (MED) diet recommends a whole-grain diet as the staple food, and the LF model does not emphasise restricting the type of staple food, which may also have some effect. Based on previous studies, the dietary fibre content of cereals is higher than that of refined carbohydrates (e.g., rice and noodles), and the higher the dietary fibre intake, the lower the body weight, glycaemic load and triglyceride and cholesterol levels (39), which would better explain the advantages of the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC dietary model. The Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC group is more finely structured than the LF group and is more useful for clinicians to understand its specific application. The strength of this study lies in the combination of the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet model and the LC diet model, with specific dietary interventions based on calorie restriction and a comparison with the LF group.",ebee4441-9544-469f-ae4e-cd72365e4b39
34,discussion14," Analysis of the results shows that the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC diet model with calorie restriction has a greater advantage in the improvement of all indicators in overweight patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and it provides a better reference for the intervention criteria of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diet structure. In addition, the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC diet model has a more specific reference for the arrangement of the diet structure, which also facilitates clinical application. Few prospective controlled studies have used the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet model for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). One single-arm study of the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet model combined with a ketogenic diet model showed that the combined diet model was effective in improving polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) anthropometric indicators, reproductive endocrine levels and IR levels (40).",fd2f6516-9e79-418e-a06e-8bfb7064bc2d
35,discussion15," However, the ketogenic diet is not long lasting because of potential negative effects on the kidneys and adverse effects such as decreased insulin sensitivity after withdrawal of ketones (41), which also has some reference value for our study. Notably, this study still has significant limitations similar to other studies of lifestyle interventions. First, patient adherence to the dietary intervention in this study was highly problematic, with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients having difficulty adhering to a single dietary model for 12 consecutive weeks. Second, this study was a single-centre trial, and the participants were all Chinese patients. The development of the diet plan considered certain regional characteristics, and the generalised type of diet may have some limitations for various food cultures. Third, the treatment period was only 12 weeks, without long-term intervention and follow-up, and some statistical biases against long-term effects were found.",8ce0100f-d04b-46d6-89b1-8fc5a3e2fd11
36,discussion16," Therefore, this study could establish a relatively advantageous dietary model as a model reference for clinicians in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with regard to dietary interventions.  Conclusion  This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Mediterranean diet (MED) diet model in combination with the LC diet model in the treatment of overweight patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on restricting total energy intake, compared with the LF diet model.  The results of the study showed that the LF and Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC dietary models were effective in modifying anthropometric parameters, reproductive endocrine levels, IR levels and lipid levels in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC dietary model being more effective and the recovery of menstrual cycles being approximately the same in both groups.",be9d7e7a-9cce-41bc-880f-e68359607be5
37,discussion17," Therefore, the Mediterranean diet (MED)/LC diet model was recommended for the treatment of overweight patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
