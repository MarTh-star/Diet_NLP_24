Maternal & Child Nutrition, 19 , e13454. 10.1111/mcn.13454 ==== Body pmc1 INTRODUCTION  During pregnancy, essential immunometabolic adaptations occur to sustain pregnancy and promote foetal growth and development (Kalagiri et al., 2016; Yockey & Iwasaki, 2018). Nonetheless, an exacerbation or dysregulation of inflammatory and cardiometabolic markers might lead to a higher risk of developing pregnancy‐related complications such as gestational hypertension, pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm labour, and spontaneous abortion (Kalagiri et al.",a140a612-4da4-4c06-8f91-ab0224ce7085
4,abstract4,", 2016; Martin et al., 2016; Salazar Garcia et al., 2018; Sheiner et al., 2019; Stokkeland et al., 2019). These complications have adverse outcomes for both the mother and infant, which may appear during pregnancy or at birth, or even suppose a lifelong risk for cardiovascular disease, type‐2 diabetes, and other chronic metabolic conditions for the offspring (Kalagiri et al., 2016).  Maternal dietary intake is one potentially modifiable behaviour that might positively impact materno‐foetal immunometabolic markers (Martin et al., 2016). However, evidence of the whole diet that considers complex nutrient and food interaction when examining materno‐foetal cardiometabolic health is rare and conflicting (Chen et al., 2021; Khoury et al., 2005, 2007). In this context, the Mediterranean diet (MD) might be beneficial for materno‐foetal health (Biagi et al., 2019).",34dbb9f7-04f0-4866-a79b-b179176f4874
5,abstract5," For the mother, achieving a healthier dietary pattern, such as the MD, seems to lower the risk for gestational diabetes (Izadi et al., 2016; Mahjoub et al., 2021), gestational hypertension (Schoenaker et al., 2015) and is associated with lower triglycerides (Martin et al., 2016) and fasting blood glucose (Mahjoub et al., 2021) concentrations. As for the foetus, greater maternal MD adherence has been associated with a reduced occurrence of preterm birth, better lipoprotein concentration, and insulin sensitivity measured in the umbilical cord (Biagi et al., 2019; Gesteiro et al., 2012, 2015). To our knowledge, only one previous trial (the CARRDIP, Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Diet in Pregnancy) has investigated the effect of a cholesterol‐lowering diet based on fish, low‐fat meats and dairy products, oils, whole grains, fruits and legumes during pregnancy on materno‐foetal lipid and inflammatory markers (Khoury et al., 2005, 2007).",4867212f-8ea8-4078-b7c0-64c5930e7db2
6,abstract6," They found that this diet lowered total cholesterol and LDL‐C concentrations in the mothers throughout the pregnancy (Khoury et al., 2005), yet this did not lead to improvements in the maternal or foetal lipid and inflammatory profiles (Khoury et al., 2007).  Further studies considering not only dietary habits but also diet quality during pregnancy, and their relation with both maternal and foetal immunometabolic serum markers, are required to provide more robust evidence on this relevant topic. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the associations of MD adherence during pregnancy and MD components, with maternal and cord arterial and venous glycemic, lipid and inflammatory serum markers.  2 ",21223318-5813-41cf-a165-a2d36081330f
7,methods0," 2.1 Study design and participants  These are secondary analyses of the GEStation and FITness (GEStation and FITness (GESTAFIT)) project where a concurrent exercise programme (60 min/session, 3 days/week of combined aerobic and strength training) from the 17th g.w. until delivery of concurrent exercise intervention (i.e., aerobic plus strength training) was conducted (Aparicio et al., 2016). The participants were recruited between the 11th and 13th gestational weeks (g.w.) at the ‘San Cecilio’ University Hospital (Granada, Spain) during their first gynaecologist checkup. The study was carried out at the ‘Sport and Health University Research Institute’ (Granada, Spain) and at the ‘San Cecilio and Virgen de las Nieves University Hospitals’ from November 2015 to April 2018. This study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Granada, Government of Andalusia, Spain (code: GESFIT‐0448‐N‐15). The general assessment procedures are detailed in Supporting Information: Figure S1.",d0d745eb-1d9a-4eda-aab1-1f87c26b8aa9
8,methods1," Of 384 pregnant women assessed for eligibility, 159 women who met the inclusion–exclusion criteria and accepted to participate (Supporting Information: Table S1) were recruited for the GEStation and FITness (GESTAFIT) project. All participants provided a written informed consent. Among them, a total of 152 had valid data in sociodemographic characteristics and MD adherence at the 16th g.w. and were included in the present analyses (Supporting Information: Figure S2). Funding limitations of the project made it unfeasible to collect cord serum samples from all the women included, and thus, a total of 43 women provided cord serum samples for the glycemic, lipid and inflammatory marker assessment. Among them, a total of 35 women had valid data in food frequency questionnaires and, therefore, MD adherence and were included in the present analyses.  2.1.",1e0ccf16-69d7-49e0-ad12-9ef4ca0a7c50
9,methods2,"1 Sample size calculation  The sample size for this study depended on the ‘a priori’ analyses of the statistical power performed in the GEStation and FITness (GESTAFIT) project (Aparicio et al., 2016). Based on the primary outcome (i.e., maternal weight gains and maternal/neonatal glycemic profiles), we planned to recruit 60 women assuming a statistical power of 90%, α = 0.05, and 15% of potential withdrawals. Given the exploratory basis of the present study (secondary outcomes), we did not calculate the sample size.  2.2 Outcomes  2.2.1 Maternal anthropometry and body composition  Mothers reported their pre‐pregnancy weight at the recruitment (i.e., 12th g.w.). Although measured weight is preferable, self‐report is a cost‐effective and practical measurement approach that shows very good concordance with measured body weight (Headen et al., 2017). Weight and height were measured at the first and the second contact with the project team (16th g.w. and 34th g.w., respectively).",dc019c6d-280b-47d5-8298-303dd00ad758
10,methods3," Body weight and height were assessed using a scale (InBody R20; Biospace) and a stadiometer (Seca 22), respectively. Height and pre‐pregnancy weight were used to calculate pre‐pregnancy body mass index, as weight (kg) divided by squared height (m2).  2.2.2 Blood collection  Maternal blood samples (5 ml) were extracted from the antecubital vein in standardized fasting conditions (at the 16th and 34th g.w.), and arterial and vein cord blood samples were extracted immediately after delivery. All blood samples were collected in serum tubes and were allowed to clot (coagulation) at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged at 1750 rpm for 10 min at 4°C in a refrigerated centrifuge (GS−6R Beckman Coulter) to obtain serum, which was aliquoted and frozen at −80°C until analyzed.  2.2.",b0a172e1-e8a7-4d20-bc7d-a61f129f5f9f
11,methods4,"3 Biochemical markers  Glycemic profile, lipids and C‐reactive proteins  Maternal concentrations of serum total cholesterol, HDL‐cholesterol, LDL‐cholesterol, glucose, phospholipids, triglycerides and C‐reactive proteins were measured with standard spectrophotometric enzyme assays (AU5822 Clinical Chemistry Analyser, Beckman Coulter). Cord arterial and venous serum total cholesterol, HDL‐cholesterol, LDL‐cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides, and CRP were measured with spectrophotometric determination (BS‐200 Chemistry Analyzer, Mindray Bio‐medical Electronics). In addition, triglycerides/HDL‐cholesterol and LDL‐c/HDL‐c ratios were calculated (Eshriqui et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021).  Insulin  Maternal insulin (at the 16th and 34th g.w.) was measured with paramagnetic‐particle‐based chemiluminescence immunoassays (UniCel‐Dxl800 Access Immunoassay analyser, Beckman Coulter).",c0173f33-becb-47d4-a68c-c9c6f0d69e10
12,methods5,"  Inflammatory markers  Some maternal and cord arterial and venous pro‐inflammatory and anti‐inflammatory cytokines (IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐10, IL‐1beta, interferon gamma and TNF‐α) were assessed with Luminex xMAP technology. The plate was read on a LABScan 100 analyzer (Luminex Corporation) with xPONENT software for data acquisition. Average values for each set of duplicate samples or standards were within 15% of the mean.  Maternal insulin resistance  To assess maternal insulin resistance the homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA)‐IR was employed as previously described (HOMA‐IR = insulin × glucose/22.5) (Matthews et al., 1985).  Dietary assessment and Mediterranean diet adherence  Dietary habits were assessed at the 16th and 34th g.w. with a food frequency questionnaire previously evaluated for validity in the Spanish nonpregnant adult population (Mataix et al., 2000). By means of the data obtained from the food frequency questionnaire, the Mediterranean Diet Score (Panagiotakos et al.",c00534ed-6da9-4719-afed-3a0aafffb1fd
13,methods6,", 2006) was employed to assess MD adherence as previously done in this study sample (Flor‐Alemany et al., 2021). The Mediterranean Diet Score (Panagiotakos et al., 2006) consists of 11 variables (i.e., whole grain cereals, potatoes, fruits, vegetables, pulses, fish, olive oil, red wine, red meat and subproducts, poultry and whole dairy products) ranging from 0 to 5 according to their position in the MD pyramid (Bach‐Faig et al., 2011). Therefore, the total score ranges from 0 to 55. A moderate alcohol intake, also typical of the MD, was not considered for calculating the index in this group of women, since they must not drink alcohol during this period. As a result, the maximum score considered for these analyses in pregnant women was 50 points. Higher scores indicate higher MD adherence and, therefore, higher diet quality. The dietary pattern registered at the 16th g.w. was taken as representative of the pregnancy diet habits as previously done in this study sample (Flor‐Alemany et al.",ec62ebe8-f1ff-41bd-a74c-05b7f153c059
14,methods7,", 2022).  2.3 Statistical analysis  Descriptive characteristics are presented as means and standard deviations for continuous variables and as frequency and percentages for categorical variables.  As initially designed (Aparicio et al., 2016), statistical analysis was conducted on a per‐protocol basis. We only included women who attended more than 75% of exercise sessions and had valid data in both baseline and follow‐up assessments. The changes (post‐test [34th g.w.]‐pre‐test [16th g.w.]) of MD adherence and MD components were calculated. Changes (post‐test–pre‐test) in dietary variables were included as dependent variables, whereas the exercise intervention (control or exercise group) as independent variables.  Hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed to examine the associations of MD adherence (i.e., explanatory variable) with maternal and neonatal lipid, glycemic and inflammatory serum markers (i.e.",a7525b2a-be55-4606-a63e-93b091212a37
15,methods8,", glucose, HOMA‐IR, total cholesterol, LDL‐C, HDL‐C, triglycerides, phospholipids, IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐10, IFN‐γ, TNF‐α and CRP). The stepwise method was used, entering potential confounders (i.e., age, gestational weight gain, and smoking habit) in Step 1 to test their association with each outcome (lipid, glycemic, and inflammatory serum markers in separate models). In Step 2 of the hierarchical regressions, we entered the MD adherence as a predictor and each lipid, glycemic, and inflammatory serum marker as outcomes in separate regression analyses after the inclusion of the relevant confounders (i.e., those that explained a significant amount of the variance in lipid, glycemic and inflammatory serum markers) found in Step 1. These steps were the same in the cross‐sectional association models (i.e., maternal outcomes measured at the 16th g.w.) and in the longitudinal association models (i.e., maternal outcomes measured at the 34th g.w. and neonatal outcomes).",d9b1c28b-ac30-47f6-91fa-d5805f09b186
16,methods9," The longitudinal models were additionally adjusted for the exercise intervention in Step 2 to account for the possible effect of the intervention conducted within the GEStation and FITness (GESTAFIT) project on these outcomes. As an exploratory analysis, additional linear regressions were performed using the MD components as explanatory variables and maternal (at the 16th and 34th g.w.) and neonatal serum markers after adjusting for the confounders previously found relevant in the hierarchal linear regression.

24,discussion0,"  Our results suggest that a greater MD adherence during pregnancy, which seems to be driven by a higher intake of fish, whole grain cereals, fruits and vegetables and a lower intake of sweets, was associated with better maternal lipid serum markers (i.e., lower total cholesterol, higher HDL‐C and lower LDL‐C, LDL‐C/HDL‐C ratio and triglyceride/HDL‐C ratio) throughout the gestation. Notwithstanding, a greater MD adherence during pregnancy was not associated with cord arterial and venous serum markers.  Our findings of an association between MD adherence and maternal cardiometabolic markers throughout gestation were generally consistent with results from other studies (Asemi et al., 2013; Khoury et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2016). Previous randomized controlled trials (Asemi et al., 2013; Khoury et al., 2005; Killeen et al., 2021) and observational studies (Eshriqui et al., 2020; Martin et al.",88b08b7f-21b8-42f7-9dd6-a88d0d26208c
25,discussion1,", 2016) found an association between healthier maternal dietary patterns and lower total cholesterol, higher HDL‐C, lower LDL‐C, LDL‐C/HDL‐C ratio and triglycerides. Regarding MD adherence, pregnant women in the second trimester of pregnancy (22–26th g.w.) who had a high MD adherence showed lower triglycerides, LDL and total cholesterol compared with pregnant women with a low MD adherence (Šarac et al., 2021). In line with previous studies that showed the beneficial effect of MD adherence regarding blood lipid control (Neuenschwander et al., 2019; Tuttolomondo et al., 2019), we verified that a greater MD adherence during gestation was associated with lower LDL‐C concentrations, higher HDL‐C, as well as lower LDL‐C/HDL‐C ratio, triglycerides, cholesterol, and triglyceride/HDL‐C ratio values at the 16th and 34th g.w., thus indicating a favourable lipid profile. Moreover, we examined which MD components explained the associations between MD adherence and maternal lipid serum markers.",532844fe-cb10-4e32-a839-47bf1547f4bf
26,discussion2," We found that a greater intake of fish (mainly driven by white fish [1.3 servings/week], blue fish [1.0 servings/week], canned fish [1.0 servings/week], and shellfish [0.6 servings/week]), whole grain cereals, fruits, and vegetables and a lower intake of sweets was associated with higher HDL‐C, lower LDL‐C, LDL‐C/HDL‐C ratio, triglycerides and triglyceride/HDL‐C ratio. Although our cross‐sectional design does not allow inferring causality, these significant associations in pregnant women, without cardiometabolic diseases, are suggestive of the role of diet in the lipid profile. In agreement, a multiethnic cohort study showed that a ‘healthy’ dietary pattern, characterized by high intakes of whole grains, fruit, dairy, vegetables and unsaturated cooking oil, was inversely associated with total cholesterol, LDL‐C and triglycerides concentrations and positively associated with HDL‐C concentration (Whitton et al., 2018).",ed08af6c-352c-484c-af08-87d7f50fb3a1
27,discussion3," Furthermore, women with a dietary pattern characterized by high intakes of fruits, yogurt, nuts, vegetables, whole grain cereals and legumes, among other components, were inversely associated with LDL‐C, LDL‐c/HDL‐c ratio and triglycerides (Eshriqui et al., 2020). On the contrary, a dietary pattern characterized by high intakes of snacks, processed meat, fast food, alcoholic beverages and sweets was directly associated with LDL‐C in adult women (Eshriqui et al., 2020). The higher intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains in these patterns should have contributed to greater dietary fibre and phytochemical contents, known to be beneficial to risk factors such as LDL‐C (Anderson & Hanna, 1999). On the contrary, a combination of unhealthier dietary habits in the ‘Processed’ dietary pattern could explain the deleterious association found (Eshriqui et al., 2020; Gershuni, 2018).",3c6da8b2-2e63-4f4a-a178-bcd1c9d16394
28,discussion4,"  Besides, in the present study, a greater MD adherence was associated with lower concentrations of TNF‐α. These results are in line with the conclusion that the MD exerts its anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect by decreasing pro‐inflammatory interleukins such as TNF‐α and its receptors (Calder et al., 2011; Estruch, 2010). Moreover, it was proven that green vegetables and fruits rich in folate, flavonoids, and antioxidants can significantly reduce the concentrations of inflammatory serum markers, such as TNF‐α (Holt et al., 2009). Similarly, we found that a greater intake of whole grain cereals and vegetables was associated with lower concentrations of TNF‐α at the 34th g.w. To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to report such an association, which might be relevant to attenuate the pregnancy‐induced inflammation processes.",b3873ffd-a3ee-4ae6-b749-7b7e265f03e8
29,discussion5," However, this finding should be taken with caution since this association was disregarded by the multiple comparison test, and future studies with higher sample sizes should therefore confirm or contrast this finding.  The lack of association between MD adherence and serum glucose and HOMA‐IR in our study agrees with previous studies (Siervo et al., 2015; Starling et al., 2017) but differs from others (Asemi et al., 2013; Martin et al., 2016; Mompeo et al., 2021; Villegas et al., 2004). In this context, a systematic review and meta‐analysis have not shown the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) on fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance in nonpregnant adult population (Siervo et al., 2015). Among pregnant women, adherence to a dietary pattern characterized by an intake of poultry, nuts, cheese, and whole grains was not associated with maternal fasting glucose (Starling et al., 2017).",8144acb1-13c9-4284-9b51-1ebbf2788836
30,discussion6," Notwithstanding, other studies in pregnant women (Asemi et al., 2013; Martin et al., 2016) at the 24–29th g.w. showed that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score‐based method and a dietary pattern characterized by high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low‐fat dairy, breakfast bars and water have been associated with lower maternal glucose, insulin and HOMA‐IR (Martin et al., 2016). However, different g.w. in the measurements may partially account for the differing findings. Furthermore, there is a lack of uniformity between indices to assess diet quality during pregnancy (Papazian et al., 2019), specifically in the number of components including classification categories for each item; measurement scales; statistical parameters (mean, median or quintiles of daily intake); and the contribution of each component (positive or negative) to the total score (Aoun et al., 2019; Milà‐Villarroel et al., 2011).",bdfde765-996c-4985-86ac-035928e02045
31,discussion7," The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet index is a sample quintile‐based sum score of seven components (fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, poultry, fish, and eggs; nuts, seeds, and legumes; fats and oils; and sodium) (Yu et al., 2014), whereas the Mediterranean Diet Score is based on 11 food groups (nonrefined cereals, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, legumes, olive oil, fish, red meat, poultry, full‐fat dairy products and alcohol) that include predefined portions and absolute cut‐offs for each food group and assesses the frequency of consumption per month (Panagiotakos et al., 2006). This complicates the comparability between these two indices and could explain, at least in part, the heterogeneity of findings in dietary patterns research during pregnancy. We did not observe an association between MD adherence, MD components, and HOMA‐IR throughout pregnancy.",2677414b-faec-4326-83f2-1f43177f52a2
32,discussion8," Although the mechanisms explaining associations between the maternal dietary patterns, insulin resistance, and triglyceride concentrations are still partially unclear, the results are biologically plausible. According to previous evidence (Martin et al., 2016), healthier dietary patterns (e.g., tertile 3 in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet) have higher intakes of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. These food groups are rich sources of antioxidants, phytochemicals, vitamin C, and dietary fibre, which may contribute to the protective associations seen in their study.",a2daad30-83ed-40ca-b2f9-192254caf55f
33,discussion9," Discrepancies between the association of dietary patterns with maternal cardiometabolic markers might be partially explained by differences in the ethnicity of the sample population given the fact that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern and its association with cardiometabolic profiles differed by country, with significant within‐country variations by sociodemographic characteristics (Tiong et al., 2018). However, it is likely due to large methodological differences, such as reverse causation given the cross‐sectional design, the method of assessing diet quality, the choice of covariates and variation in sample sizes and sample characteristics, and resulting statistical power.  Little information is available on the effects of maternal diet during pregnancy on the offspring's glycemic, lipid and inflammatory serum markers with previous studies reporting mixed findings (Gesteiro et al., 2012, 2015; Khoury et al., 2005). Previous studies (Gesteiro et al.",7fda73bd-c3de-4bbc-b566-bfad724c11ba
34,discussion10,", 2012, 2015) found that pregnant women with higher MD adherence during the first trimester of pregnancy (12–15th g.w.) had infants with lower glycemia, insulinemia, HOMA‐IR and LDL‐C compared with women with low MD adherence. The well‐documented transference of placental lipids suggests that a maternal diet with a low MD score negatively affects neonatal LDL‐cholesterol (Gesteiro et al., 2015). However, we did not find differences between neonatal LDL‐cholesterol and the degree of adherence to the MD diet during gestation. In agreement with our results, Killeen et al. (2021) found no associations between the maternal inflammatory potential of the diet and triglycerides, HDL‐C, LDL‐C, total cholesterol and glucose in the cord blood. Furthermore, a maternal diet that promoted fish, low‐fat meats and dairy products, oils, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes decreased maternal cholesterol concentrations, but not cord and neonatal lipids or inflammatory markers (Khoury et al.",2645cced-b4ae-4fab-ae75-c79e2b76421f
35,discussion11,", 2005, 2007), which is in agreement with our findings.  4.1 Limitations and strengths  Some limitations need to be highlighted. First, the observational design does not allow a clear cause–effect identification. Second, the results should be interpreted cautiously, as we could be limited to detect small association sizes. Larger studies should further explore these associations to corroborate our results. Third, the participants were enroled in an exercise intervention that might affect our findings. However, we included the group allocation as a confounder in our longitudinal analyses. Furthermore, we observed that the GEStation and FITness (GESTAFIT) exercise intervention did not have any effect on the MD adherence, nor on any of its components (except for legumes). Thus, the primary exposure (i.e., exercise) is not likely to have affected our findings. Fourth, the limited data (n = 35) in our study regarding cord blood could bias our findings.",de900c90-6ff9-4493-9c93-0ae8dac30b1e
36,discussion12," However, we found no differences in the baseline characteristics between women who provided cord serum samples and those who did not. Additionally, although our findings were corrected for multiple comparison testing, the likelihood of making a type I error might not be completely disregarded and future studies should confirm our findings. Several strengths of this study are worth considering. A detailed definition of the dietary habits and a valid assessment of the MD diet adherence were employed. Furthermore, lipid, glycemic, and inflammatory serum markers were assessed during the second and the third trimester of pregnancy and in the arterial and vein cord blood, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of materno‐foetal immunometabolic serum markers along the pregnancy course.  5 ",25438988-4c47-41c3-96c5-a1694caa7da5
37,conclusion0," Our results suggest a positive role of MD adherence during pregnancy on maternal lipid serum markers. Likewise, MD adherence might be positively associated with the inflammatory marker TNF‐alpha, although this finding should be corroborated in future studies. However, a greater MD adherence during pregnancy was not associated with neonatal lipid, glycemic, and inflammatory markers. Future studies are warranted to confirm these associations and determine the underlying mechanisms.
