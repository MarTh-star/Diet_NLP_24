Sample The ANIBES study was conducted using stratified multistage sampling. To guarantee better coverage and representativeness, the fieldwork was performed at 128 sampling points all across Spain. No pre-recruitment was considered so as to minimize the risk of bias in responses. The design of the ANIBES study aimed to define a sample size that is representative of all individuals living in Spain, aged 9 to 75 years, and living in municipalities of at least 2000 inhabitants. The initial potential sample consisted of 2634 individuals, and the final sample comprised 2009 individuals (1013 men, 50.4%; 996 women, 49.6%). In addition, for the youngest age groups (9–12, 13–17, and 18–24 years), a boost sample was included to have at least n = 200 per age group (error +/−6.9%). Therefore, the random sample plus booster comprised 2285 participants.",2b529bf6-e893-49f1-911e-4d1c00421eac
1,methods1,"  The sample quotas according to the following variables were: age groups (9–12, 13–17, 18–64, and 65–75 years); sex (men/women); geographical distribution (Northeast, Levant, Southwest, North-Central, Barcelona, Madrid, Balearic and Canary Islands); and locality size: 2000 to 30,000 inhabitants (rural population); 30,000 to 200,000 inhabitants (semi-urban population) and over 200,000 inhabitants (urban population). Additionally, other factors for sample adjustment were considered: unemployment rate, percentage of foreigners (immigrant population), physical activity level, and education or economic level.  The fieldwork for the ANIBES study was conducted from mid-September 2013 to mid-November 2013, and two previous pilot studies were also performed. To equally represent all days of the week, subjects participated during two weekdays and one weekend day. The final protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee for Clinical Research of the Region of Madrid (Spain).  2.2.",eb46f7b5-ff3b-48d4-89f7-90219291c85f
2,methods2," Food and Beverage Record Study participants were provided with a tablet device (Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0) and trained in how to record information by taking photos of all food and drinks consumed during the three days of the study, both at home and outside the home. Photos had to be taken before beginning to eat and drink, and again after finishing, so as to record the actual intake. Additionally, a brief description of meals, recipes, brands, and other data was recorded using the device. Participants who declared or demonstrated that they were unable to use the tablet device were offered other options, such as using a digital camera and paper record and/or conducting telephone interviews. A total 79% of the sample used a tablet, 12% a digital camera, and 9% opted for a telephone interview.",d50d8bef-4994-4a76-8817-f7c583791a06
3,methods3," In addition to details of what and how much was eaten, for each eating/drinking event participants recorded where they were, who they were eating with, and whether they were watching television and/or sitting at a table. After each survey day, participants recorded if their intake was representative for that day (or the reason why if it was not), and details of any dietary supplements taken. The survey also contained a series of questions about participants’ customary eating habits (e.g., the type of milk or fat spread usually consumed) to facilitate further coding. Food records were returned from the field in real time, to be coded by trained coders who were supervised by dieticians. An ad hoc central server software/database was developed for this purpose, to be able to work in parallel with the codification and verification processes. The software was developed to receive information from the field tablets every 2s, and the database was updated every 30 min.",937933af-315b-4bb5-b424-01f4ae4319c9

Data obtained from food manufacturers and nutritional information provided on food labels were also included. A food photographic atlas was used to assist in assigning gram weights to portion sizes. Energy distribution objectives for the Spanish population were used to analyze the overall quality of the diet [24].  2.3. Statistical Analysis  Once all dietary intake information was transformed into energy and nutrient data, these data were processed using different statistical analysis tools and packages.",39afa432-d40c-44a0-9892-423663fdf68f
5,methods5," The following statistics were calculated to qualify each variable in the analysis: average, standard deviation, and variance to measure dispersion in the values; minimum and maximum values, median, quartiles (as well as interquartile range), and deciles to describe the shape of the distribution. The Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test was used to test normality of the distribution. In addition, the intake data were grouped into 14 food groups, 45 subgroups and 754 ingredients for in-depth analysis.  nutrients-07-04739-t001_Table 1Table 1 Total daily energy intake, by sex and age group, in the ANIBES survey of the Spanish population aged 9–75 years, expressed as kilocalories and megajoules.

6,methods11,"  Table 2 shows the energy intake distribution (median, percentiles, and maximum/minimum) according to age group and sex. In terms of the contribution of macronutrients to dietary energy (Table 3), carbohydrates contributed the highest proportion (41.1%), followed by fats (38.5%) and proteins (16.8%); other minor energy sources were alcohol (1.9%) and fiber (1.4%). Women had higher sugar and fat intakes (p < 0.05) and men higher alcohol intakes (p < 0.05). Concerning the energy provided by fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) contributed 16.8%, saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)) 11.7%, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) 6.6% (5.40% n-6 class; 0.63% n-3). No gender differences were observed for the lipid profile. However, there were differences according to age group: saturated fatty acids (SFA) contribution to energy intake was highest for children (13.1%) and lowest for the oldest age group (10.",17495561-d5da-4762-9293-70592d6e3116
7,methods22," Within this food group, bread was the major contributor in all age groups (11.6%); this was followed by baked goods and pastries (6.8%), which ranked highest for children and adolescents and much lower for elderly adults. Other minor contributors were grains and flours (4.5%), pasta (3.6%), and breakfast cereals and cereal bars (1.0%). Meat and meat products were the second largest contributor (15.2%), with the lowest ranking for the elderly population (13.1%) and the highest for adolescents (16.2%). Within this category, meat contributed 9.2% of total energy, whereas the sausage and meat derivative subgroup supplied 5.8%. Oils and fats (12.3%) were the third major contributor; these came mainly from olive oil (9.2%) with only 1.7% for other oils and 1.4% for butter, margarine and shortenings. Milk and dairy products contributed 11.8% of total energy intake, and this was higher in children (15.9%) than in adults (11.8%).",bd55d75d-6619-4538-b546-a225f4abd8bf
8,methods23," The different types of milk represented about half the energy intake within this group, followed by cheeses (3.0%), and then closely by yogurt and fermented milk (2.4%). Interestingly, these four food and beverage groups contributed roughly two-thirds (66.7%) of the total energy intake. Much lower contributors included fruits (4.7%), except for in the elderly population (8.7%); ready-to eat meals (4.2%), ranking from 6.6% in adolescents to 1.8% in elderly adults; vegetables (4.0%: 5.0% in elderly adults and 3.0% in children); and non-alcoholic beverages (3.9%: 4.9% in children, 6.1% in adolescents, 3.9% in adults, and 2.2% in elderly adults). Within this category, sugared soft drinks contributed 2% of total daily energy intake (1.9% in children, 3.4% in adolescents, 2.1% in adults, and 0.7% in elderly adults), followed by juices and nectars (1.3%). Fish and shellfish contributed 3.6% of total daily energy intake (2.2%–4.7%, increasing with age group). Sugars and sweets contributed 3.",0e09a194-97d2-4a2d-a60a-595071082344

Finally, pulses (2.2%) and eggs (2.2%) had minor contributions to energy intake.  4. Discussion 4.1. Energy Intake and Profile There is consensus in the literature that society as a whole is currently in a nutritional transition and there is a need for accurate and updated dietary intake data. Total mean daily energy intake in the ANIBES study is lower than in other surveys like the ENIDE study (“Encuesta Nacional de Ingesta Dietética Española”) [20], a nationwide survey carried out in 2011 with people aged 18–64 where leftovers were not considered as in the ANIBES study.",a462668b-569d-4164-8d6d-17cc402f7351
10,methods25," The Food Consumption Survey (Food Consumption Survey (FCS)), conducted in Spain since 1987, revealed that mean energy consumption for the Spanish adult population in 2010 was 2609 kcal/person/day, which was clearly lower than in 1964 (3008 kcal/person/day) [19,25,26]. However, it should be considered that overestimation may exist in this survey since discards were not recorded. Therefore, our present findings confirm a decreasing trend in energy intake, which has been observed in Spain from different surveys [19,26,27,28] and is consistent with a similar pattern that is occurring in most European countries [29,30,31,32].",7804354a-b803-46e5-bcfa-4318022de18d
11,methods26," When compared with European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (European Food Safety Authority 2013) dietary reference values for energy [33] and current (2013) Spanish dietary recommendations for energy [23], intake in the ANIBES study population was only adequate for boys and girls, whereas it was below the average requirement (AR) considering a physical activity level of 1.6 (moderate), for adolescent males (80% of the AR), adult males (78.0% of the AR), and elderly males (77.9% of the AR). In adolescent men, P75 and higher was necessary to guarantee the established AR, and similar was observed for adolescent women. For females, these were 82.6% of the established AR for adolescent women, 82.0% in the case of adult women, and 80.5% for elderly women. It should be considered of special concern that P50 of elderly women in the ANIBES study consumed only 1,426 kcal/day, which may compromise an adequate nutrient-dense diet during the ageing process.",28384bca-62b8-42a2-987f-608ec44b0f81
12,methods27," In addition, the nutritional status of elderly men (65 to 75 years) may be compromised since only those above P75 reached the adequate AR for energy intake. When national current (2013) dietary recommendations for energy [23] were used for comparison, the results were even more marked in terms of potential insufficient energy intake, with boys only able to cover 81.9% of the recommended dietary intake (recommended dietary intake (RDI)); this was 82.3% in the case of girls. Of special note are adolescent men (75.9% of recommended dietary intake (RDI)) and women (76.0% of recommended dietary intake (RDI)), and particularly adults (69.0% of recommended dietary intake (RDI) for men; 79.5% for women) and the elderly population (73.8% of recommended dietary intake (RDI) for men; 78.7% for women).",f4d58dc2-a4e9-4468-8b1f-d1578d5c2284
13,methods28," It should be considered, however, that these recommended dietary intake (RDI) may be insufficiently up to date with respect to stratification of current physical activity levels for the Spanish population.  One of the main dietary quality indices is the energy/caloric profile. In the ANIBES study, protein intake was 16.8%E, well above the upper recommended limit (<15%E). The ENIDE study showed a similar percentage of energy from protein, 18%E, and trends in the Spain Food Consumption Survey (FCS) are similar [19,20]. Protein intake as a percent of total energy intake ranged from 11.1%E to 17.6%E in the different European countries included in the European Nutrition Health Report (2009) [14]. Fat intake for the total ANIBES study population was 38.5%E, being significantly higher for women. However, there were no age differences in terms of fat contribution to energy, which ranged from 37.2%E in elderly adults to 38.9%E in children.",c36d3f80-a740-4f7f-8084-eae53b33466a
14,methods29," Fat is an important dense source of energy and facilitates the absorption of fat-soluble dietary components, such as vitamins. Fats and oils are also important sources of essential fatty acids. However, high-fat diets may decrease insulin sensitivity and are positively associated with increased cardiovascular risk [34,35,36], although a precise dose-response relationship has not been defined. There is evidence that moderate fat intake (<35%E) is accompanied by reduced energy intake and therefore, moderate weight reduction and/or prevention of weight gain may be better achieved. However, European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has concluded that there are insufficient data to define a lower threshold intake (lower threshold intake (LTI)) or tolerable upper intake level (UL) for total fat [37]. Presently, at a European level, a lower boundary for the reference intake range of 20%E and an upper boundary of 35%E have been proposed [37].",65712643-7164-45d9-bc46-871ea4483b95
15,methods30," A similar range has been recently proposed by World Health Organization (WHO) and FAO [36].  The saturated fatty acids (SFA) intake in the ANIBES study was above the recommendations for all age groups and both genders. saturated fatty acids (SFA) are synthetized by the body and are not required in the diet; therefore, no dietary reference intakes have been set. However, there is a positive dose-dependent relationship between intake of a mixture of saturated fatty acids and blood low density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)) cholesterol concentrations, when compared with carbohydrates [36]. There is also evidence from dietary intervention studies that decreasing the intake of products rich in saturated fatty acids by replacing them with products rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (without changing total fat intake) decreased the number of cardiovascular events [38,39,40].",f1f39e50-57e8-44fc-b720-ab7d05bfeaa5
16,methods31," Because the relationship between increased saturated fatty acid intake and increased low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations is continuous, no threshold of saturated fatty acid intake can be defined below which there is no adverse effect; therefore, no UL can be set, as European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has recently established [37]. Even so, the World Health Organization (WHO)/FAO have recommended that a maximum intake of 10%E for saturated fatty acids should be set [36]. This limit for saturated fatty acids (SFA) has also been proposed very recently in the Federación Española de Sociedades de Nutrición Alimentación y Dietética (FESNAD) Consensus Document on Dietary Fats and Oils for the Adult Spanish Population [41]. Interestingly, the American Heart Association (American Heart Association (AHA)) has recommended a maximum intake of <7%E for saturated fatty acids (SFA) to reduce cardiovascular risk [42].",82f282a4-0c9f-4e4b-a739-6c14128ca85c
17,methods32," More recently (2013), the dietary guidelines launched jointly by the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology proposed a lower amount of energy from saturated fatty acids (SFA) (5%–6%E) [43], although there is insufficient scientific evidence proving an association between saturated fatty acids (SFA) and cardiovascular and/or diabetes risk.  It is agreed that one positive aspect of the dietary patterns in Spain that should be maintained is the relatively high proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), mostly owing to the common use of olive oil in the Spanish diet [44,45]. In our ANIBES population, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) contributed 16.8%E; this was slightly higher in the elderly group and lower in children and adolescents. monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) intake from energy across Europe ranged from 22% in Greece to 11% in non-olive-oil-consuming countries [37].",6a10d609-f325-4ba3-a011-84f4cfc31dd8
18,methods33," The 2011 goals of the Spanish Society of Community Nutrition (Society of Community Nutrition (SENC)) [24] recommended that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) should contribute >20%E of total energy. In 2010, an European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) panel [37] proposed not setting any dietary reference value for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) based on the following: monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are synthesized by the body, have no known specific role in preventing or promoting diet-related diseases, and are therefore not indispensable constituents of the diet. This assumption by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), however, is untenable as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are among the most abundant fatty acids in most tissue cells and contribute to maintaining membrane fluidity and enzymatic activities.",1fa0afcc-79ff-48a1-a656-93ec4e23123f
19,methods34," Additionally, there is convincing evidence that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) lower both total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) plasma cholesterol levels, and replacement of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)). Indeed, the FAO/World Health Organization (WHO) have recommended a monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) intake of about 16%–19% (obtained by the difference in intake between saturated fatty acids (SFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) [36]. Moreover, in the PREDIMED intervention study [46], intake of virgin olive oil (high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) content) was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and total mortality. Interestingly, participants who followed the olive oil-rich Mediterranean diet had a mean monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) intake of 22%E.",379087ab-cc90-407c-a859-2a095899a9be
20,methods35," Therefore, from the PREDIMED study findings, a monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) intake target of 20%E–25%E (with virgin olive oil as a main source) is desirable. As for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), in view of the different metabolic effects of the various dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [45,47], European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has proposed not to formulate a dietary reference value for the intake of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [37]. Other organizations, such as World Health Organization (WHO)/FAO in 2010 [36] and Society of Community Nutrition (SENC) (2011) [24], have suggested that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) should contribute 6%–10% and 5%, respectively, of total energy intake. In the present study, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) contributed roughly 6.6%E, with no gender or age differences. In addition, total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intake expressed as the percentage of energy intake was 0.",eeb2b3b8-da82-4d31-afd4-1cc1855ea3ff
21,methods36,"63%E for the ANIBES study population and increased with age. The World Health Organization (WHO)/FAO [36] have recommended a minimum intake for adults of 250 mg/day for n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and up to 2 g/day to help prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD).  Intervention studies have provided evidence that high fat (>35%E), low carbohydrate (<50%E) diets are associated with adverse short- and long-term effects on body weight, although the data are insufficient to define an lower threshold intake (LTI) for carbohydrates [47,48]. An European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) panel [47] therefore reached the conclusion that only a reference intake range can be given, 45%E–60%E, where monosaccharides plus disaccharides should be below 10% of the total energy intake.",5df7a5cc-84ce-4163-bfe8-e29134b863cd
22,methods37," Data from different dietary surveys have shown that average carbohydrate intakes for children and adolescents in European countries varied between 43%E and 58%E, and from 38%E to 56%E in adults, whereas average sugar intakes varied between 16%E and 36%E in children and adults [14,47]. In the present study, a low energy intake of 41.1% from carbohydrates was seen (17.0% from sugars); a trend was observed according to age, with the lowest contribution in elderly males (39.6%E) and the highest in the youngest age groups (44.4%E). Similar results and trends were obtained for the ENIDE dietary survey in Spain [20]. It is known that frequent consumption of sugar-containing foods can increase the risk of dental caries [49]. However, the available data do not allow the setting of an upper limit for intake of (added) sugars on the basis of risk reduction for dental caries.",352027f3-141c-4771-8097-8bf906fd9444
23,methods38," Evidence relating a high intake of sugars (mainly as added sugars), compared with high starch intakes, to weight gain is also inconsistent [50]. In consequence, according to European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the available data are insufficient to set an upper limit for added sugar intake [36]. Moreover, although there is some evidence that high sugar intakes (>20%E) may increase serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations and might adversely affect serum glucose and insulin levels, these data are also insufficient to set an upper limit for (added) sugar intake. The latter does not exclude, however, that food-based dietary guidelines and nutrition goals for the population should take into account the potential negative roles under certain conditions [24,51]. A new World Health Organization (WHO) guideline [52] recommends that adults and children reduce their daily intake of free sugars to less than 10% of their total energy intake.",3919d894-8cd7-4aaa-84e2-f4b5836a5f33
24,methods39," A further reduction to below 5% has been suggested to provide additional health benefits. The percentage of energy from sugars in our study was 17.0%E for the total population, and was significantly higher in females compared with males and more marked in the oldest participants.  Other minor sources of energy from diet were also estimated. Fiber intake contributed 1.4%E of the total energy, which was significantly higher in females than males. Alcohol intake contribution in the adult populations was considered moderate at 1.9%E. However, alcohol intake is one of the dietary components for which underreporting may occur, especially in women and participants with higher education levels and socioeconomic status [53,54]. In fact, energy contribution from alcohol in men was almost two-fold compared with women. On the other hand, the highest contribution from alcohol corresponded to elderly males (4.1%E), and it was much higher than for elderly women (1.4%E).  4.2.",70baf2d2-55b6-476b-82b5-1c527966c877
25,methods40," Food Sources of Energy We were able to make the most detailed evaluation to date of how the different food groups and subgroups contribute to energy intake in the Spanish diet. The food group contributing the most to energy consumption was cereals and derivatives (27.4%), regardless of age group or gender. This pattern should be considered positive, but is insufficient for adequate nutrient density (i.e., carbohydrates and dietary fiber intake). Individually, bread was the main contributor, although more efforts are needed to return consumption to levels seen in previous generations of Spaniards, according to the traditional Mediterranean diet [55,56]. Moreover, the baked goods and pastry subgroup closely followed bread, with potentially higher contributions of sugar and unhealthy fats, which was the case for all age groups and especially the youngest (9.4%E).",cd5c10d0-2fea-4f29-8c65-e7c640db3050
26,methods41," Interestingly, ready-to-eat breakfast cereals and cereal bars contributed most in adolescents, with much lower contribution in the elderly population. Our results also revealed that the contribution of meat and meat products seemed very high for all age groups, which made it difficult to reach the recommended energy and lipid profiles. For comparison, the meats and derivatives group accounted for a total 179 g/adult/day in the last Food Consumption Survey (FCS) (2012), and has remained steadily high over the last 12 years. Moreover, it should be noted that this food group has increased by roughly 300% when compared with 1960s results in Spain. In addition, caution should be advised since the subgroup that includes sausages and other meat products represented approximately 7.0%E of the total energy in children and adolescents from the ANIBES sample, which was quite different from the elderly group (4.5%E).  The next main group contributing to energy intake was oils and fats (12.",1f21cbd3-8bb1-4c79-97b2-7169d8d2a30b
27,methods42,"3%E), but age-marked differences were seen. The lowest contribution was in children and adolescents accounting for 10%E, but this was 15%E in elderly adults; this means that a “missing” percentage of the energy from oils and fats in the youngest age groups may be replaced by meat and meat products. Fortunately, olive oil represented the main contributor, with nearly 10%E of total intake. Milk and dairy products were next in energy contribution, showing a clear decreasing trend with advancing age. As expected, milk was the main subgroup, although a decreasing trend in milk consumption has been observed in Spain in recent years. In fact, a significant decrease in the amount of purchased dairy products has taken place from the years 2000 (416 g/person/day) to 2012 (359 g/person/day), according to the Food Consumption Survey (FCS) [19,26]. One of the main concerns is the possibility that milk is being replaced by other less nutrient-dense foods and beverages, mainly in younger age groups.",1177fec7-5d5f-4c7b-af89-8bd010a64acc
28,methods43," In the ENIDE dietary survey during 2011 in Spain [14], the main sources of energy were meat and meat products (18%), followed by cereals and derivatives (17%), oils and fats (12%), and milk and dairy products (11%). According to the Spain Food Consumption Survey (FCS), the food groups contributing most to energy consumption were cereals and derivatives (24.6%), meat and meat products (14.3%), oils and fats (13.6%) and milk and derivatives (12.5%). By contrast, fish and shellfish (3%), non-alcoholic beverages (2.9%), and alcoholic beverages (2.3%) showed a lower contribution to total energy intake. By comparison, data from other European countries (e.g., Nordic countries) showed that cereals and milk and dairy products are usually the main energy sources, ahead of the meat and derivatives group [57,58].  In the present ANIBES study, the following contributing groups showed a marked gap, since the sum of the remaining disaggregated 35 food and beverage groups and subgroups was only 33.",16ab4627-aaa1-4e21-ac19-5767b6e6bc1e
29,methods44,"2% (600 kcal/day) of the total energy intake. Interestingly, the contribution of fish to total energy intake was only 3.6% and increased markedly with advancing age. This may compensate for younger age groups, to achieve current dietary guidelines for fish consumption [24]. The Food Consumption Survey (FCS) showed similar results for fish and shellfish as sources of energy (3.0%). However, the ENIDE results were much higher (9%) for fish, shellfish, and derivatives in the adult population [14].  The impact of sugared soft drink consumption on obesity and metabolic disorders has come under intense scrutiny and debate worldwide in recent years [59,60,61,62], and large differences between countries have been observed. The present study showed that sugared soft drinks contributed 2.0% (36 kcal/day out of 1810 kcal/day) to total energy intake. A lower consumption compared with mean contribution was seen in children (1.",a97cacea-f48e-4c6f-ae78-96cb1830de22
30,methods45,"9%E, 34 kcal/day) whereas the lowest contribution was for the elderly population (0.7%E, 13 kcal/day). Higher consumptions were found, however, for adolescents (3.4%E, 61 kcal/day) and the contribution in adults was 2.1%E, 38 kcal/day. Using Food Consumption Survey (FCS) data, we have previously shown [17] that all non-alcoholic drinks contributed 2.9% to total energy intake in Spain. For additional comparison, in the ENIDE dietary survey, non-dairy beverages (excluding alcoholic drinks) contributed 2%E (46 kcal/day) in the adult Spanish population [20]. By contrast, the United States has usually had the highest contribution to energy intake from sweetened beverages. However, a recent study using data from NHANES surveys showed that from 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2004, the consumption of these beverages increased [63], but consumption of beverages and foods with added sugars declined from 1999 to 2000 [64].",2331f3b9-b6f3-485e-b912-903650b69a6a
31,methods46," Another food group of concern, which is usually not well quantified, is that of so-called sugars and sweets, mainly owing to its potential role in overweight, obesity, and several metabolic disorders [59,60,61,62]. We showed that this group currently represents 3.3% of total energy intake in Spain and decreases with age (5.1% in children and 2.6% in elderly adults). In the ENIDE survey, this food group contributed 5% to total energy intake [20].  Finally, we found lower contribution than initially expected from alcoholic drinks (2.6%E, 47 kcal/day), which was higher for elderly participants. Alcoholic beverages of lower alcohol content (beer, wine, cider) represented over 90% of energy contribution within this group. These results are similar to those obtained from the latest Spanish Food Consumption Survey (FCS) (2.3%E) [19]. In general, alcoholic beverage consumption has undergone a slow decline during recent years (259 g/person/day in 2000 versus 208 g/person/day in 2012) [19].",2dc803e4-5bb1-4b60-9802-3888ec5ae102
32,methods47," Within this group, as a beverage traditionally included in the Mediterranean diet concept, wine only represented 23.5% of total alcoholic beverage consumption whereas it accounted for 62% of the total consumption in 1991. In the last few years, a gradual substitution of wine for beer has taken place, which represents almost 70% of the total alcoholic beverage consumption at present [19].  5. Conclusions To summarize, the top 10 food groups and subgroups of energy sources in the Spanish diet were (in decreasing order): bread, olive oil, fresh meat, baked goods and pastry, sausages and other processed meats, milks, fruits, ready-to-eat meals, vegetables, and grains and flours. These accounted for about two-thirds of total energy intake, whereas the remaining 33% of the energy from foods and beverages was widely distributed among 35 different food and beverage subgroups.",6723b5b4-1600-48be-a826-ea255545827c
33,methods48," In conclusion, the strengths of the design, protocol and methodology used in the ANIBES study are the representative national sample targeted, the broad age range included (9–75 years), the geographical distribution (mainland and islands), successful logistics for the 128 sampling points, and innovative and novel use of tools to measure dietary intake and leftovers. However, the ANIBES study had some limitations, mainly difficulties for some participants (e.g., elderly adults) in using new technology to record intakes. There was also no accounting for seasonality in food consumption. Finally, although ANIBES data were representative of the Spanish population, caution should be used in inferring causal relationships between diet quality, body weight, and other health outcomes. Despite the limitations, these data are the best available to evaluate current dietary energy intake and its determinants for the Spanish population. ",ebbf9ae2-feaf-4cc4-8c1f-67fb9a6f78fe
