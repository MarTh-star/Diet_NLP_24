0,conclusion0,"This review focuses on the Mediterranean herb, rosemary, its polyphenolic diterpenes (carnosic acid and carnosol) and their role in chemoprevention of prostate cancer. Epidemiological studies suggest a reduced risk of cancer in patients consuming rosemary. Herein, we have described the mechanism by which carnosic acid and carnosol inhibits prostate cancer. Essentially both diterpenes inhibit cancer by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting the critical PI3K/Akt signaling pathway which is an important regulator of tumor cell survival. These findings warrant further research to understand the potential of rosemary as a cancer chemopreventive agent in prostate cancer.
