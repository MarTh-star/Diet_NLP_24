0,methods0,"2.1. Plant Material and Isolation of Extracts Six plant species, C. lanatus (gkourounáki), C. intybus (kavouráki), C. sancta (ladáki), S. asper (zochós), C. spinosum (stamnagkáthi), and A. blitum (vlíto), were obtained from local markets in Athens (Greece; spring of 2015). Five of them were from the family of Asteraceae and one from the family of Amaranthaceae (i.e., A. blitum). The samples were botanically characterized at the Laboratory of Pharmacognosy and Natural Products Chemistry. As described previously [24], the leaves and stems were boiled with water (500 g of plant material/1 l of water), for 20 minutes. After cooling at room temperature, the decoctions were filtered through paper and evaporated to dryness. Moreover, three of the extracts and more specifically those of C. lanatus, C. sancta, and C. intybus were enriched by using XAD7 HP Amberlite® adsorption resin. All of the dry extracts were submitted to HPLC-PDA chemical analysis.  2.2.",2079fc01-5ff0-4dac-b3bd-b33f7bc3d690
1,methods1," HPLC-PDA Analysis For the HPLC analysis of the extracts, a Thermo Finnigan® HPLC-PDA System (P4000 Pump, AS3000 Autosampler, PDA Detector UV8000, ChromQuest™ 4.2 Software) and a Supelco® RP18 Discovery HS-C18 (250 mm, 4.6 mm, and 5 μm) column were employed. 20 μl of water extracts at 1.5 mg/ml was injected. The mobile phase was 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and MeOH (B). Elution started with 2% (B), reaching 100% (B) in 60 minutes. These conditions were kept for 4 minutes before getting back to initial conditions in 2 min for a 4 min reequilibration. The flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/min and the column temperature at 25°C. Relative quantification of the main secondary metabolites was performed at 280 nm absorbance.  2.3.",20bf8d0c-a6aa-4082-a73a-10da15a4c400
2,methods2," Evaluation of the Total Polyphenolic Content (Total Polyphenolic Content (TPC)) of the Extracts The evaluation of the Total Polyphenolic Content (TPC) of the plant extracts was assessed spectrophotometrically at 765 nm by using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent as described previously [25]. Total Polyphenolic Content (TPC) was determined by a standard curve of absorbance values in correlation with standard concentrations (50–1500 μg/ml) of gallic acid. The Total Polyphenolic Content (TPC) was expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalents (gallic acid equivalents (GAE)) per g of dry weight (dw) of extract.  2.4. ABTS•+ Radical Scavenging Assay ABTS•+ radical scavenging capacity of the extracts was performed as described previously [26]. Briefly, ABTS•+ radical was generated by mixing 2 mM ABTS with 30 μM H2O2 and 6 μM horseradish peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase (HRP)) enzyme in 1 ml of distilled water. The mixture was vortexed vigorously and left at room temperature in the dark for 45 min.",05b28844-a152-4c39-a451-c7edd469c42f
3,methods3," Subsequently, 10 μl of extract at different concentrations was added in the reaction solution and the absorbance at 730 nm was read. In each experiment, a blank was used consisting of the tested sample in distilled water, ABTS•+, and H2O2. The ABTS•+ radical solution with 10 μl H2O was used as control. After measuring the absorbance, the percentage of radical scavenging capacity (radical scavenging capacity (RSC)) of the tested extracts was calculated. In addition, for comparison of the extracts' radical scavenging efficiency, IC50 value indicating the concentration that caused 50% scavenging of ABTS•+ radical was calculated from the graph-plotted radical scavenging capacity (RSC) percentage against extract concentration. At least two independent experiments in triplicate were performed for each tested compound.  2.5. Superoxide Radical Scavenging Assay The superoxide anion radical (O2 •−) scavenging activity of the extracts was evaluated as described previously [27].",b82c3964-16be-4baa-be93-84cfd1a232e1
4,methods4," In brief, O2 • is produced by the PMS-NADH system through oxidation of NADH and is measured spectrophotometrically at 560 nm by the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)). Antioxidants may scavenge O2 •− and consequently reduce absorbance. The radical scavenging capacity (RSC) and the IC50 values for O2 •− were evaluated as mentioned above for ABTS•+ radical. At least two independent experiments in triplicate were performed for each tested compound.  2.6. Reducing Power Assay Reducing power was determined spectrophotometrically as described previously [28]. RP0.5AU value showing the extract concentration-caused absorbance of 0.5 at 700 nm was calculated from the graph-plotted absorbance against extract concentration. At least two independent experiments in triplicate were performed for each tested compound.  2.7. Peroxyl Radical-Induced DNA Plasmid Strand Cleavage The assay was performed as described previously [29].",a607eb45-50ce-4451-84f1-a742c3158db8
5,methods5," In brief, peroxyl radicals (ROO•) were produced from thermal decomposition of 2,2′-azobis (2-amidinopropane hydrochloride) (azobis (2 amidinopropane hydrochloride) (AAPH)). The reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 1 μg pBluescript-SK+ plasmid DNA, 2.5 mM azobis (2 amidinopropane hydrochloride) (AAPH) in phosphate-buffered saline (phosphate buffered saline (PBS)), and the tested extract at different concentrations was incubated in the dark for 45 min at 37°C. Then the reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 μl loading buffer (0.25% bromophenol blue and 30% glycerol). After analyzing the DNA samples by agarose gel electrophoresis, they were photographed and analyzed using the Alpha Innotech Multi Image (ProteinSimple, California, USA). In addition, plasmid DNA was treated with each extract alone at the highest concentration used in the assay in order to test their effects on plasmid DNA conformation.",275cd4e5-0f5c-4a45-91a3-06be856943d1
6,methods6," The percentage of the protective activity of the tested extracts from ROO•-induced DNA strand breakage was calculated using the following formula:  (1) %inhibition=S–S0Scontrol–S0×100, where S control is the percentage of supercoiled DNA in the negative control sample (plasmid DNA alone), S 0 is the percentage of supercoiled plasmid DNA in the positive control sample (without tested extracts but in the presence of the radical initiating factor), and S is the percentage of supercoiled plasmid DNA in the sample with the tested extracts and the radical initiating factor. Moreover, IC50 values showing the concentration that inhibited the azobis (2 amidinopropane hydrochloride) (AAPH)-induced relaxation by 50% were calculated from the graph-plotted percentage inhibition against extract concentration. At least two independent experiments in triplicate were performed for each tested compound.  2.8.",5f78a0fa-dd94-4fd3-9936-d9af15f4ec75
7,methods7," Bacterial Strain Seven hundred microliters of the stock culture of Salmonella typhimurium TA102 strain (MOLTOX, Boone, NC) was used to inoculate 30 ml of Oxoid nutrient broth no. 2. The inoculated cultures were placed on a shaker (100 rpm) and incubated in the dark at 37°C until the cells reached a density of 1-2 × 109 colony forming units (CFU/ml, OD540 between 0.1 and 0.2).  2.9. The Antimutagenicity Test Two of the extracts (i.e., C. lanatus and C. intybus) enriched with polyphenols that exhibited the highest protective activity against ROO•-induced DNA plasmid damage were also examined for their inhibitory activity against Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced mutagenicity in S. typhimurium TA102 bacterial cells. Similarly, C. spinosum extract, the most potent among nonenriched extracts, was also examined for its antimutagenic activity in S. typhimurium TA102 bacterial cells.",93a9a5c8-44bf-4d95-bb19-368ec609ffe6
8,methods8,"  For the antimutagenicity examination, the standard plate incorporation procedure was used as described previously [27, 30, 31]. Tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) was used as mutagenic agent. Specifically, the following substances were added in screwed sterile tubes maintained at 45°C ± 2°C: 2 ml top agar, 100 μl bacterial culture of S. typhimurium TA102 strain, 50 μl t-BOOH solution (0.4 mM final concentration), and 50 μl extract at various concentrations. The contents of the tubes were mixed and poured onto the surface of glucose minimal agar plates. Then the plates were inverted and placed in an incubator, at 37°C ± 2°C for 48 h. Afterwards, the histidine revertant colonies (His+) were counted. Before counting, the agar plates were microscopically checked for toxicity [31]. Each assay included both positive (oxidizing agent alone) and negative (plates without oxidizing agent or tested extract) controls.",96103258-6538-40bb-9b38-101f28947e58
9,methods9," Also, each antioxidant was checked at the two highest concentrations used in the antimutagenicity assay, for possible induction of mutations.  For evaluation of the percent inhibition of mutagenicity, the number of induced revertants was obtained by subtracting the number of spontaneous revertants from the number of revertants on the plates containing the mutagen and/or antioxidant. The percentage inhibition of mutagenicity was calculated as follows:  (2) Inhibition=1−number  of  colonies/plate  with  oxidant+test  compoundnumber  of  colonies/plate  with  oxidant  alone×100.    At least two independent experiments in triplicate were performed for each tested compound.  2.10. Cell Culture Conditions As described previously [32], human endothelial EA.hy926 cells were cultured in normal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)) in plastic disposable tissue culture flasks at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide.  2.11.",2ac851a1-33bf-47ff-85aa-40e2ebbcfa54
10,methods10," XTT Assay To examine the extracts' antioxidant activity in endothelial cells, noncytotoxic concentrations were used. For selection of these concentrations, extracts' cytotoxicity in endothelial cells was checked using the cell viability XTT assay kit (Roche, Switzerland) as described previously [28]. Briefly, EA.hy926 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate with 1 × 104 cells per well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) medium. After 24 h incubation, the cells were treated with different concentrations of the extracts in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) medium for 24 h. Then 50 μl of XTT test solution was added to each well. After 4 h of incubation, absorbance was measured at 450 nm and also at 630 nm as a reference wavelength in a Biotek ELx800 microplate reader (Winooski, Vermont, USA). Negative control was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) serum-free medium.",6635a40c-e0ea-4857-b1db-bff249b91c69
11,methods11," The absorbance values of the control and samples were used for calculation of the percentage inhibition of cell growth caused by the extract treatment. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and on two separate occasions.  2.12. Treatment of EA.hy926 Cells with the Extracts  C. lanatus and C. intybus extracts which exhibited the highest free radical scavenging potency among extracts enriched with polyphenols were examined for their antioxidant capacity in endothelial EA.hy926 cells. C. spinosum extract, the most potent of nonenriched with polyphenols extracts, was also examined in endothelial cells. The cells were cultured in flasks for 24 h. Afterwards, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing the tested extracts at noncytotoxic concentrations. The cells were treated with the extracts for 24 h, and then they were trypsinized, collected, and centrifuged twice at 300 × g for 10 min at 5°C.",d3f19928-a7eb-453f-89f9-7164481d6ec9
12,methods12," At the end of the first centrifugation, the supernatant fluid was discarded and the cellular pellet was resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After the second centrifugation, the cell pellet was collected and used to measure the glutathione (glutathione (GSH)) and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the mRNA levels of antioxidant genes.  2.13. Assessment of glutathione (GSH) and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) Levels by Flow Cytometry Analysis in Endothelial Cells The glutathione (GSH) and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in EA.hy926 cells were assessed using mercury orange and DCF-DA, respectively, as described previously [33, 34]. In brief, for assessment of the glutathione (GSH) and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, the cells were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 1 × 106 cells/ml and incubated in the presence of mercury orange (10 μΜ) and DCF-DA (40 μΜ), respectively, in the dark at 37°C for 30 min.",2676c083-7f03-412c-881c-51d40db24d45
13,methods13," Then the cells were washed, resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and submitted to flow cytometric analysis using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, New Jersey, USA) with excitation and emission wavelengths at 488 and 530 nm for Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and at 488 and 580 nm for glutathione (GSH). Data were analyzed using “BD CellQuest” software (Becton Dickinson). Each experiment was repeated at least three times.  2.14. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) of Antioxidant Genes The extract that exhibited the highest antioxidant potency in endothelial cells (i.e., C. intybus) was examined for its effects on the transcriptional expression of major antioxidant genes, as described previously [35]. Specifically, EA.hy926 cells were treated with C. intybus extract at 50 μg/ml for 3, 12, and 24 h. Then RNA was extracted from cell pellet (see Section 2.11) using an RNA isolation kit (PureLink™ RNA kit, Invitrogen, USA).",36f7083d-95cb-447c-ad7f-69d9f0432ff7
14,methods14," The extracted RNA (~10 μg) was treated with DNase (RQ1 RNase-Free DNase, 1 U/μl, Promega, USA). DNA-free RNA was then reverse transcribed to obtain cDNA (SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen, USA) using oligo (dT) 12-18 primers (Invitrogen, USA). Amplification of cDNAs for the NFE2L2, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL)C, GSR, GPX1, HMOX1, CAT, SOD1, NQO1, TXN, and GAPDH genes was carried out in 10 μl reactions containing SYBR® Select Master Mix 2X (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA), 0.25 μΜ of each primer, 50 nM ROX Low, and 25 ng cDNA for the amplification of all genes. The utilized primers are shown in Table 1. The thermocycling conditions used for the amplification of the aforementioned genes were the following: 3 min at 95°C, 45 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C, and 30 sec at 53°C followed by 30 sec at 72°C. Finally, a melting curve was carried out from 53°C to 95°C to check the specificity of the products. All qRT-PCR were performed on a μx3005P system (Stratagene, UK).",8ca5dd4f-ec97-4b92-9f7b-7714dde7e064
15,methods15," Amplification efficiencies were >86% with r 2 values > 0.981 for all genes.  2.15. Statistical Analysis All results were expressed as mean ± SD. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. One-way ANOVA was performed followed by Tukey's test for multiple pair-wise comparisons using the SPSS 20.0 software.  3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Polyphenolic Composition of Extracts The range of the Total Polyphenolic Content (TPC) in the tested extracts was from 56 to 408 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/gr dw (Table 2). As expected, C. lanatus, C. intybus, and C. sancta exhibited the higher Total Polyphenolic Content (TPC) values (408, 320, and 288 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/gr dw of extract, respectively), since they were enriched with polyphenols by using absorption resin (Table 2). All the extracts from the Asteraceae family were rich in phenolic compounds and particularly hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoid derivatives. All the members of the Cichoriae tribe (i.e., C.",9dab1444-fdf2-42b6-82d2-c82ecb9e5728
16,methods16," spinosum, C. intybus, C. sancta, and S. asper) presented a similar chemical profile (Figure 1) with variations to the relative percentages of specific secondary metabolites in each extract (supplementary material (available here)). Based on the literature [36] and previous LC-MS analyses (data not shown) of the extracts, we estimated that two caffeoyl tartaric acid derivatives, namely, caftaric acid and cichoric acid, constituted the predominant compounds of these extracts and could be responsible for the decoctions' biological activities. C. lanatus-enriched decoction appeared to possess extremely high amounts of phenolic substances, most probably glycosides of the flavonoids quercetin and luteolin, while its profile was complimented by the presence of caffeoylquinic acid isomers and dimers. On the other hand, the A. blitum extract was quite poor in phenolic compounds with only a few, minor peaks observed in the medium polarity area of its chromatogram.",5f4b6f8f-6a79-486c-99ec-aee7b775ee41
17,methods17," However, as expected from a member of the Amaranthaceae family, the presence of the nonpolar triterpene saponins was evident.  3.2. Free Radical Scavenging Activity and Reducing Power of Extracts The IC50 values against ABTS•+ and O2 •− radicals are shown in Table 2. Low IC50 values mean strong antioxidant potency. In the ABTS•+ method, the IC50 extended from 7.9 (C. lanatus) to 72.0 μg/ml (A. blitum), and in O2 •− radical assay, it was from 6.3 (C. lanatus) to 56.0 μg/ml (S. asper) (Table 2). It was remarkable that C. lanatus extract had the highest potency in ABTS•+ and O2 •− radical assays and exhibited activity at too low concentrations. As mentioned, C. lanatus had also the highest Total Polyphenolic Content (TPC), and so, its rich polyphenolic content may explain the high antioxidant activity. Moreover, the polyphenols (i.e., quercetin, luteolin, and caffeoylquinic acid derivatives) found in C. lanatus have been known as strong free radical scavengers [37, 38].",a0db4795-1e0c-45f8-9d9b-9bc18d2e40da
18,methods18," In general, the three extracts (i.e., C. lanatus, C. intybus, and C. sancta) enriched with polyphenols due to use of absorption resin exhibited IC50 values which were at least 2-fold lower than those of the other extracts (Table 2). Although ABTS•+ radical is one of the most used for examining compounds' antioxidant activity, it is a synthetic radical. However, O2 •− is one of the most common and reactive radicals found in living organisms [3]. Superoxide radical may be produced in vivo by the reactions of the electron transport chains in mitochondria (1–3% of electrons forming O2 •−), activated phagocytic cells, enzymatic activity (e.g., P450 enzymes and xanthine oxidase), and autooxidation reactions of biomolecules (e.g., adrenalin and FADH2) [2]. Superoxide radical may cause damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, and these effects seem to increase with aging [3].",2f3e2f47-9a4e-4446-b9d2-7062c807f6bd
19,methods19," Thus, it is important for prevention of oxidative stress-induced diseases to find out compounds which effectively scavenge O2 •−.  In the reducing power assay, RP0.5AU values ranged from 5.0 (C. lanatus) to 65.0 (A. blitum) (Table 2). Like IC50 values, the lower the RP0.5AU value is, the higher is the reducing power activity. The reducing power of a compound is an indication of its antioxidant activity, because it shows its ability to act as an electron donor and consequently to neutralize free radicals [39]. Again, C. lanatus extract was the most potent in this assay, while the other two extracts (i.e., C. intybus and C. sancta) that were enriched with polyphenols had also high reducing activity (Table 2). However, in this assay, C. spinosum extract also exhibited high reducing potency (RP0.5AU: 8.0), although it was not processed with absorption resins (Table 2). This C.",895ac951-e4bb-4982-92da-1d455ccf793e
20,methods20," spinosum extract's high activity may be explained by the type of its polyphenols or by the presence of other chemical compounds which may be very effective as hydrogen donors.  3.3. Antimutagenic Activity of Extracts against Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-Induced DNA Damage All the tested extracts inhibited ROO•-induced DNA plasmid breakage, with IC50 values ranging from 105 to 970 μg/ml (Table 2 and Figure 2). The potency order was C. lanatus = C. intybus > C. sancta > C. spinosum > A. blitum > S. asper (Table 2). Similar to antioxidant assays, the three extracts enriched with polyphenols by passage through resin column exhibited at least 2-fold higher protective activity compared to other extracts. The ROO• radicals that caused the DNA damage in this assay are produced within cells after the addition of O2 to carbon-centered radicals [40]. Subsequently, ROO• can oxidize DNA bases to their hydroxyl derivatives resulting in mutations and manifestation of diseases [41].",db8fada9-3998-4274-a286-84d91ba604cc
21,methods21," These detrimental effects may be prevented by the use of the tested extracts through diet as the present findings suggested. Interestingly, quercetin, luteolin, and caffeoylquinic acid found in C. lanatus extract have been demonstrated to scavenge ROO• [42, 43].  The two most potent extracts enriched with polyphenols due to passage through resin (i.e., C. lanatus and C. intybus) and the most potent (i.e., C. spinosum) among nonenriched extracts were also tested for their inhibitory potency against Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced mutagenicity in S. typhimurium TA102 bacterial cells. The results from this assay supported those from DNA plasmid cleavage assay, since all three extracts inhibited dose-dependent t-BOOH-induced mutagenicity (Figure 3). Specifically, C. lanatus extract inhibited significantly t-BOOH-induced mutations by 12.3, 17.9, 31.7, 48.7, and 66.9% at 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/plate, respectively, C. intybus extract by 17.0, 19.6, 30.0, 38.0, and 56.",933bce77-5012-4356-936b-4b8d4bbccd28
22,methods22,"9% at 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/plate, respectively, and C. spinosum extract by 12.2, 24.7, and 48.1% at 100, 200, and 400 μg/plate, respectively (Figure 3). The two extracts enriched with polyphenols had higher inhibitory activity than the nonenriched extract, indicating that the polyphenols accounted mainly for the observed protection from mutagenicity. The t-BOOH reacts with Fe2+ in cells and generates HO• causing DNA damage [3]. The OH• radicals are the major Reactive oxygen species (ROS) to react with either DNA bases or deoxyribose resulting in DNA damage and mutations [3]. Thus, it was important that the tested extracts protected from OH•-induced DNA mutations. C. lanatus extract was again the most potent due, at least in part, to its identified polyphenols, since previous studies have shown that quercetin and luteolin inhibited t-BOOH-induced mutagenicity in TA102 cells [44]. Moreover, Jho et al.",389ec138-f10c-4eb0-a3ed-fc019089bd79
23,methods23," [45] have reported that a caffeoylquinic derivative inhibited t-BOOH-induced DNA damage in human liver HepG2 cells.  3.4. Effects of Extracts on the Antioxidant Status of Endothelial Cells  C. lanatus and C. intybus extracts, the two most potent extracts enriched with polyphenols, and C. spinosum extract, the most potent among nonenriched extracts, were examined for their antioxidant activity in human endothelial EA.hy926 cells. Firstly, the extracts' cytotoxicity was evaluated, so as noncytotoxic concentrations to be used for the assessment of the antioxidant activity. The results from XTT assay showed that C. intybus, C. lanatus, and C. spinosum extracts exhibited significant cytotoxicity above 100, 200, and 600 μg/ml, respectively (Figure 4). Thus, the selected concentrations of the C. intybus, C. lanatus, and C. spinosum extracts in the following assays were up to 50, 100, and 400 μg/ml, respectively.",a9e35579-d6c6-4e38-889f-1c84aa7ef954
24,methods24,"  The assessment of the extracts' effects on the antioxidant capacity of endothelial cells was based on the measurement of glutathione (GSH) and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by flow cytometry. The results showed that C. intybus increased significantly glutathione (GSH) levels by 10.8, 15.2, and 33.4% at 10, 25, and 50 μg/ml, respectively, compared to control, C. lanatus by 15.9, 21.5, and 24.7% at 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml, respectively, and C. spinosum by 10.5 and 21.6% at 50 and 100 μg/ml, respectively (Figure 5). The increase in glutathione (GSH) after extract treatment is important, since glutathione (GSH) is considered as a significant endogenous antioxidant molecule in cells [46]. glutathione (GSH) may scavenge directly free radicals by donating one hydrogen atom from its sulfhydryl group or is used as substrate by antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione transferase (glutathione transferase (GST)) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) [46].",f2a6d1ee-778c-45e1-92ab-780c65d90534
25,methods25," Especially for endothelial cells, glutathione (GSH) is important not only as antioxidant but also as a crucial regulator of cell signaling [47, 48]. Although the effects of C. intybus and C. lanatus on glutathione (GSH) were dose dependent, the C. spinosum extract did not affect glutathione (GSH) at higher concentrations than 100 μg/ml (Figure 5). This intriguing observation may be explained by the fact that C. spinosum at 200 and 400 μg/ml exhibited a tension to decrease cell viability (Figure 4). That is, for C. spinosum, 100 μg/ml seemed to be a crucial concentration, above which cytotoxicity was caused. In turn, this cytotoxicity was encountered by glutathione (GSH) consumption. It is known that polyphenols sometimes have a biphasic effect, namely, at low concentrations, they act as antioxidants and at high concentrations, they act as prooxidants resulting in cytotoxicity [49].",84d91da7-0a32-40a6-9a49-ba4146e4cff5
26,methods26," It is also worth mentioning that polyphenols identified in the tested extracts have been reported to increase glutathione (GSH) levels. For example, quercetin has been demonstrated recently to enhance glutathione (GSH) levels in human aortic endothelial cells (human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC)) through increased expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase (glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL)), one of the major enzymes involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis [50]. Moreover, luteolin has been demonstrated to decrease oxidative stress in the mouse lung through, among other mechanisms, increase of glutathione (GSH) [51]. Additionally, administration of caftaric acid to rats inhibited lead-induced decrease in glutathione (GSH) in the kidney [52].  Unlike glutathione (GSH), extract treatment did not affect Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels too intensively (Figure 6). Only C. lanatus extract reduced significantly Reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 12.1% and C. spinosum extract by 6.8 and 15.",ffff5189-9f38-4839-9bbe-13fd7adc5a8f
27,methods27,"6% at 50 and 100 μg/ml, respectively, compared to control (Figure 6). The weak extracts' effect on Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels may be attributed to the fact that their impact was examined on the baseline Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, that is, there was not an oxidant stimulus to cells. Nevertheless, the observed decrease in Reactive oxygen species (ROS), even only at the higher extract concentrations, was in accordance with and might be attributed to the corresponding increase in the antioxidant molecule of glutathione (GSH) by the extracts (Figure 5). Interestingly, C. spinosum at concentrations higher than 100 μg/ml did not decrease further Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Figure 6). This finding supported our hypothesis mentioned above, that is, C. spinosum at concentrations above 100 μg/ml may exhibit prooxidant effect and cytotoxicity.  Since C. intybus extract induced the highest increase in antioxidant mechanism (i.e.",e6d83911-61c1-4041-a77f-179768f2f0da
28,methods28,", glutathione (GSH)) in endothelial cells, its effects on the expression at a transcriptional level of antioxidant genes were assessed (Figure 7). Specifically, it was examined if the extract affected the expression of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), the most important transcription factor regulating antioxidant genes [53]. The results from the qRT-PCR showed that C. intybus treatment upregulated significantly the expression of NFE2L2 gene encoding for Nrf2 by 7.3-fold and 8.5-fold at 12 and 24 h, respectively, compared to control (Figure 7). This finding was significant, because it indicated that the extract's compounds exerted antioxidant activity not only as direct free radical scavengers but also as modulators of molecular mechanisms. Interestingly, chicoric acid found in C. intybus extract has been reported to increase Nrf2 expression in mouse muscle [54].",4b5bf7a5-e76c-4ca9-bdfd-04e7a460aa45
29,methods29," The increase in Nrf2 expression was supported by the extract treatment-induced increase in expression of genes regulated by Nrf2. Namely, extract treatment upregulated significantly the expression of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL)C by 6.2-fold, 6.3-fold, and 3.4-fold at 3, 12, and 24 h, respectively, GSR by 9.8-fold, 8.0-fold, and 5.0-fold at 3, 12, and 24 h, respectively, NQO1 by 8.4-fold, 12.1-fold, and 6.7-fold at 3, 12, and 24 h, respectively, and HMOX1 by 4.0-fold, 4.5-fold, and 2.7-fold at 3, 12, and 24 h, respectively, compared to control (Figure 7). Especially, the increase in glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL)C and GSR expression was important, since it accounted for the C. intybus extract-induced increase in glutathione (GSH) levels (Figure 5). glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL)C gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) protein, the main enzyme involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis [40].",82404bd3-514c-4e11-86a8-87704e3c210e
30,methods30," GSR encodes for glutathione reductase (GR) enzyme regenerating glutathione (GSH) from the oxidized glutathione (glutathione (GSH) from the oxidized glutathione (GSSG)) [40]. HMOX1 and NQO1, the other two upregulating genes, encode for heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and NAD (P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), respectively. The increase in the expression of these enzymes supported further the ability of the C. intybus extract to enhance endothelial cells' antioxidant capacity, since HO-1 and NQO1 are important antioxidant enzymes participating in iron sequestration and quinone detoxification, respectively [55, 56]. C. intybus treatment did not affect the expression of CAT, SOD1, and GPX1 genes, while it downregulated significantly TXN gene expression by 35.7-fold, 10.3-fold, and 10.0-fold at 3, 12, and 24 h, respectively (Figure 7). The lack of effect on CAT, SOD1, and GPX1 and the downregulation of TXN gene were intriguing, since Nrf2 activates their expression [53].",980332ac-e872-4d0e-b5e7-e2fed6105990
31,methods31," This contradiction may be explained by the high complexity of the regulation of the antioxidant mechanisms and the interaction between them, namely, when some antioxidant mechanisms are enhanced, some others remain inactive as a compensation adaptive response of the cell [57].  4. Conclusions In conclusion, the present findings demonstrated for the first time that extracts from the edible plants C. lanatus, C. intybus, and C. spinosum enhanced antioxidant defense mechanism such as glutathione (GSH) in endothelial cells. Especially, C. spinosum extract was shown to mediate this antioxidant effect through increased expression of Nrf2, the most crucial transcription factor of antioxidant genes, and subsequent upregulation of important antioxidant genes including those involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis.",2fc91f4e-d96c-4648-a45f-784aee8a3cf7
32,methods32," Since, these plants constitute a part of the Mediterranean diet, their observed bioactivities may explain, at least in part, the prevention of this type of diet against diseases associated with endothelial function such as the cardiovascular disease [58]. Moreover, the results suggested that these extracts may be used for the development of food supplements or biofunctional foods that would protect from diseases caused by oxidative stress-induced endothelium damage.
