0,introduction0," Depression, characterized by low mood, loss of interest or pleasure in life, and disturbed sleep or appetite, affects over 300 million people globally [1], which represents a global prevalence of 7% for women and 4% for men [2]. Depression is a leading cause of disease burden and a major contributor to global disability [3]. According to the World Health Organization, depressive and anxiety disorders cost the global economy $1 trillion in lost productivity each year [4].  Despite significant developments, conventional treatment is effective only in one in three cases of mood disorder [5]. Moreover, the condition is often recurrent, with relapse apparent in 50% of cases [6]. In this context, identifying modifiable risk factors to guide intervention strategies to prevent mood disorders and decrease their severity would appear to have value. A range of demographic, biological, genetic and behavioral determinants for depression have been proposed [7–10].",abef3b16-9533-4262-b38e-577a57e32efd
1,introduction1," Of the latter, habitual diet has been increasingly examined as a potential independent predictor of disease risk (e.g., [11]) and the dietary intake of specific nutrients such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, B vitamins, zinc, and magnesium have been implicated in brain function [9, 12–15]. The neurological pathways potentially affecting depression risk that can be modulated by nutritional intake are related to inflammation, oxidative stress, neuroplasticity, mitochondrial function, and the gut microbiome [9].  The major challenge in understanding the role of diet in the etiology of chronic disease, including depression, is the characterization of this complex exposure. One approach is the identification of dietary patterns in the population under study by statistical modeling such as factor analysis (empirically-derived dietary patterns).",214507c1-f7ad-4236-ae54-5ddb14af4888
2,introduction2," These dietary patterns closely match the dietary habits of the studied population but do not necessarily reflect an optimal diet and are hardly replicable to other populations. In contrast to these a posteriori methods, a priori methods generate dietary indices based on existing knowledge of what constitutes a “healthy” diet (hypothesis-oriented dietary patterns). Based on a limited set of specific food groups, rather than specific nutrients, dietary indices reflecting adherence to an ideal diet can be very useful for clinicians to communicate with patients. Recent reviews have shown that healthy dietary patterns are associated with a decreased risk of depression or depressive disorders [16–20], but these are not universal findings [16]. Additionally, comparability of the studies is hampered by the variability in methodology and combination of estimates obtained using both hypothesis-oriented and data-driven dietary patterns.",9b2b9cde-001c-4f33-8188-07e4c147bf27
3,introduction3," There is only one review of literature using a priori defined scores based on adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet in relation to depression [21]. However, no formal comparison of the Mediterranean diet score exists with other widely used diet quality scores as, to the best of our knowledge, there is no exhaustive review of all a priori diet quality indices.  Accordingly, we provide a systematic review of studies assessing whether adherence to various dietary guidelines or traditional dietary patterns is associated with depressive symptoms and depression. For each dietary index we conducted a meta-analysis of results from observational studies. With the relationship likely to be bidirectional—mood can induce changes in eating behavior—only longitudinal studies can clarify the direction of the association. We therefore stratified our results according to study design. ",c8013f9e-2aa7-4691-9d42-fda3e5372820
4,methods0," This systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement [22] and was registered in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (# CRD42017080579 at www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO).  Search strategy  We used a four-pronged approach to identifying relevant publications. First, we searched Medline, Embase and PsychINFO via Ovid (http://www.ovid.com) for articles published since their inception (1946) to 31st May 2018. The following keywords and index terms were used (“depression” or “depress* symptom*”) AND (“diet*”) AND (“index*” or “score*” or “pattern*” or “quality”). The search was limited to articles published in the English language and to full-text articles (conference abstracts were not considered). Second, we scrutinized the reference sections of the retrieved articles and systematic reviews. Third, we contacted experts in the field. Fourth, we searched our own files.",f0477b30-1cb0-41f6-851f-db04bee4b6fb
5,methods1," The search was conducted in parallel by two authors (TA and CL) with any disagreements resolved by a third (AB).  Study selection  To be included in this systematic review, articles had to meet the following criteria: (1) Exposure: comprehensive dietary assessment (food frequency questionnaire, 24-h diet recall, food record, diet history) and use of an a priori dietary score or index; (2) Outcome: clinical depression assessed by the study staff, medical records or self-reported clinician-diagnosed (e.g., “Have you ever been diagnosed with depression by a medical doctor?”), depressive symptoms assessed by validated scales/questionnaires (such as the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale, CES-D), and defined according to validated cutoffs of these scales (i.e.",99c3f38d-1d43-472b-b99b-2ef0764aeb28
6,methods2,", cutoff of 16 for the 20-item CES-D scale) and the use of anti-depressive drugs considered only when it was combined to clinical depression or depressive symptoms assessment; (3) Design: observational study (cross-sectional, cohort, case-control); (4) Population: general free-living populations without any age limit that includes outpatients (individuals not hospitalized for physical or mental health reasons) and non-institutionalized individuals. If the study had any of the following characteristics, it was excluded: (1) Exposure: no measure of whole diet (e.g., dietary screeners or individual questions) or use of a posteriori dietary patterns; (2) Outcome: bipolar disorders, overall mood states, psychosocial stressors or perceived stress; (3) Design: intervention studies; (4) Population: pregnant or lactating women, inpatient/hospitalized populations.",1778aece-a883-4cad-89f4-8e9a4e42a4c2
7,methods3,"  Data extraction  After study selection, the following information was extracted from each retrieved article: first author’s surname, journal, year published, geographical location, study design, follow-up time (if applicable), sex and mean age, sample size, number of cases, dietary assessment tool, dietary score used (range and mean score), assessment of depression, depressive symptoms scale and threshold used (if symptoms), modeling strategy, confounders used, main findings including odds ratios or hazard/risk ratios and their standard errors/confidence intervals. When a study provided several estimates, we chose to use those from the most complex model (that is, the one including the largest number of confounders).",d9693a19-1eee-4040-8f26-e3fb0efb6fb6
8,methods4,"  Quality and risk of bias assessment  We adapted the Newcastle-Ottawa checklist [23] to assess whether cohorts were representative of the wider population (as opposed to a selected occupational group, for instance), if diet was ascertained by means of a validated dietary assessment tool (e.g., FFQ), if the dietary score used was validated, whether follow-up was sufficient to preclude reverse causation (≥5 years), and if appropriate statistical adjustment was made (age, sex, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, total energy intake). If at least four of the five of the above criteria was met, the study was considered of high quality and to be at low risk of bias. ",8c301382-b6da-4b05-be8d-5823b105b65f
9,analysis0," For each dietary score (exposure variable), we conducted separate meta-analyses dependent on study design (cross-sectional vs. longitudinal). We combined the results of the studies that presented analyses with the dietary score as a categorical variable, computing forest plots and combined odds, hazard or risk ratios for depression for the healthiest compared to the least healthy category. When the dietary score was analyzed as a continuous variable (four studies [24–27]), the estimates were not included in the calculation of the combined results. Estimates (beta and standard error) from studies that used depressive symptoms (outcome) as a continuous variable were converted into log odds ratios by multiplying by a factor 1.81 and then exponentiated [28]. We used random-effect meta-analysis models to account for potential heterogeneity and assessed heterogeneity by the I2 statistic [29].",80d4bd73-371b-47cf-a78e-d88aabbb3be4
10,analysis1," Potential for publication bias was examined using contour-enhanced funnel plots where asymmetry and absence of studies in areas of non-significance suggest the presence of reporting bias [30]. We also calculated the Egger and Begg test for small study effect. Stata version 14 (StataCorp, TX, USA) was used for the statistical analyses.  Code availability  The Stata commands metan, confunnel and metabias were used. All codes used to generate the meta-analysis results can be obtained from the authors upon request.  Sensitivity analyses  As results are stratified by dietary index and by study design, further stratification can lead to only one association estimate in some strata. Therefore, we only present the sensitivity analyses results in the subgroups that contain the majority of studies. To test the impact of outcome definition (clinical depression vs. depressive symptoms), of age of the participants, of geographical region (high vs.",2f01778e-719f-48c2-ac80-d15e1ff9769b
11,analysis2," low-middle income countries) and of study quality, we performed sensitivity analyses by variously excluding: the studies using clinical depression as they were a minority; studies on adolescents; studies performed in low-middle income countries; and studies of low quality. Finally, a study using the Mediterranean diet was identified that used psychological distress as a marker of depression [31], so we also performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding this study for a more strict assessment of depression.

12,results0," In Supplemental Fig. 1 we depict the process of study selection. The search yielded 3272 records (after exclusion of duplicates), of which 3058 were excluded after title and abstract screening. Out of the 214 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, we retained 51 that we scrutinized for methodological quality. The articles excluded are listed by reason of exclusion in Supplemental material. A total of ten articles were dropped after methodological quality check, comprising the presentation of only unadjusted comparisons between groups and no further statistical modeling in six studies [32–37], or no measure of whole diet in a further four [38–41]. This yielded a total 41 articles for this systematic review: 20 longitudinal and 21 cross-sectional studies.  The majority of studies were on generally healthy participants. Two studies involved participants at high risk of knee osteoarthritis [42, 43] and one included participants with a history of myocardial infarction [44].",73e5bc94-9d93-4913-8a4b-13738ffed21f
13,results1," Ten analyses used a Mediterranean diet score [25–27, 31, 43, 45–49], seven the Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)) or the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHealthy Eating Index (HEI)) [48, 50–55], four a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) diet score [56–59], nine the Dietary Inflammatory Index (Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)) [42, 60–67], and 15 a variety of scores such as adherence to national dietary guidelines or general “diet quality” [44, 46, 51, 68–79]. The components included in each of the main diet scores (Mediterranean, Healthy Eating Index (HEI), AHealthy Eating Index (HEI), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) are summarized in Supplemental Table 1.",498ace0a-28f3-48f1-8d51-f490c73b1731
14,results2," One study simultaneously captured three scores, a Mediterranean diet score, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), and a pro-vegetarian dietary pattern [48], another compared the Mediterranean diet score with the Australian Recommended Food Score [46], and a last one compared the AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) with three other scores [51].  We graded 32 analyses as being of high quality (scoring four or five) [25–27, 31, 42, 45, 46, 48, 49, 51, 55–58, 60–67, 69, 71–75, 77, 79], whereas 12 studies had a low quality score of three or less [43, 44, 47, 48, 50, 52–54, 59, 70, 76, 78], of which the majority (nine) were cross-sectional studies.",6a275545-2508-488c-b0ab-1ab665f0b341
15,results3,"  Mediterranean diet  Adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet was measured by four different indices: the original Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) [25, 31, 46, 48] developed by Trichopoulou and colleagues [80], the relative Mediterranean diet score (rMED) [45], the alternative Mediterranean diet score (aMED) [26, 27, 43] or the Mediterranean Style Dietary Pattern Score (Mediterranean Style Dietary Pattern Score (MSDPS)) [49]. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and rMED include nine items: five beneficial (fruit, vegetable, legumes, cereals, fish), two considered detrimental (meat, dairy), one component on fat (mono-unsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids [Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)] or olive oil intake [rMED]) and one component on moderate alcohol intake. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) ranges from zero to nine points: one point is allocated if the intake is above the median, zero if below (or inversely for detrimental items).",b73daaa9-6cde-412e-aab7-aeb297b61310
16,results4," The rMED is based on tertiles as cutoffs, therefore ranges 0–18. The aMED scores from zero (lower adherence) to five (better adherence) on 11 components (same as Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), adding poultry [detrimental] and potatoes [beneficial]), so the total score ranges 0–55. The Mediterranean Style Dietary Pattern Score (MSDPS) comprises 13 components (same as aMED, adding sweets and eggs), each scored continuously from 0 to 10 and the total score is standardized, ranging 0–100.  The study characteristics are given in Table 1. There were two reports from the same study (the Spanish Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra, Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra/University of Navarra follow up (SUN) [47, 48]), so we included the one with the longest follow-up (8.5 years) [48]. In total, we considered data from six cohort studies comprising samples drawn from France [45], Australia [31, 46], Spain [48], the UK [25] and the US [27] (average 9.1 years of follow-up).",5d5ee15f-b43f-4580-852f-a0578300a08a

We found five cohort studies from the UK [61], the US [42], France [60], Australia [65] and Spain [67] and four cross-sectional studies from the US [62, 66], Ireland [63] and Iran [64] (Table 1).

All tests for small study effects were non-significant for Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII).  Sensitivity analyses  Regarding outcome definition, when analyzing only studies on depressive symptoms outcomes (that is, excluding studies using clinical depression as outcome), the results remained similar for the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) (Supplemental Figs.",338ea612-8503-47c6-a29d-aeb92b8e5c12

Results on clinical depression all come from the Spanish Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra/University of Navarra follow up (SUN) cohort, which showed strong prospective associations with the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), Healthy Eating Index (HEI), and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores [48, 67] but not consistent with different Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores [58]. In addition, Supplemental Figure 6 shows that for all other dietary scores, significant negative associations were reported with depressive symptoms, whereas the three studies that used clinical depression report non-significant associations [71, 75, 79].",6c2952a6-8d72-4618-a169-4c03bdf1ffdc
53,results42," Regarding study quality, all cross-sectional studies using Healthy Eating Index (HEI)/AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) were judged of low quality; therefore, when limiting the evidence to high quality studies, this dietary score only shows a weak overall estimate from three cohort studies. When assessing the differences by geographical region, we found that studies in middle-income country were all conducted in Iran. Two of them, carried out in adults, assessed the cross-sectional association between the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and depressive symptoms and reported similar estimates to those observed in an Irish cross-sectional study using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score too. In addition, three Iranian studies were carried out on adolescents and found significant inverse associations between Mediterranean diet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores and depressive symptoms.",06b7572d-4195-4026-9987-f708b7e557cc
54,results43," The global estimates between each of these dietary scores and depressive symptoms were not altered after excluding studies conducted in adolescents as illustrated in Supplemental Figure 7, 8 and 9, showing results for the Mediterranean diet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores respectively. Finally, having excluded the study using psychological distress [31], the overall results of the association between a Mediterranean diet and depressive outcomes remained essentially unchanged (Supplemental Figure 10).

55,discussion0," Main findings  By focusing on dietary indices, this systematic review is the first to provide an exhaustive overview of the evidence linking a wide range of comparable a priori diet quality indices and depressive outcomes. From analyses of longitudinal studies, there is a robust association between both higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet and lower adherence to a pro-inflammatory diet and a lower risk of depression. While there are fewer studies, the same trend seems apparent for indices such as the Healthy Eating Index and several other country-specific dietary guidelines scores.  Comparison with the literature  According to recent reviews, the available evidence suggests an inverse association between healthy or prudent dietary patterns and depression, despite some inconsistent results and heterogeneity in the methods used to define healthy dietary patterns [16–20].",c2ec6c5d-9116-4746-b717-73809d048863
56,discussion1," The beneficial effect of the Mediterranean diet has been reviewed in 2013 [21] but these studies were, with one exception, cross-sectional. The addition of recent longitudinal studies reinforces the previous review in concluding that highest compared to lowest adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower risk of incident depressive outcome. A unique feature of the present review is the inclusion and comparison of a wide range of a priori dietary scores. We found that the measures of adherence to dietary guidelines that have been commonly studied in relation to other chronic diseases and mortality, Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and AHealthy Eating Index (HEI) [86–88], also show encouraging results in relation to depression; however, more longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the direction of the associations.",5f75f068-cc63-4c77-bc3d-1a2d6aa82541
57,discussion2,"  Biological mechanisms  As summarized in Supplemental Table 1, the dietary scores share common elements: higher fruits, vegetables, and nut intake, lower intakes of pro-inflammatory food items such as processed meats and trans fats, and alcohol in moderation. To date, a number of factors have been proposed to cause diet-induced damage to the brain, including oxidative stress, insulin resistance, inflammation, and changes in vascularization, as all these factors can be modified by dietary intake and have been associated with occurrence of depression [89]. Moreover, recent human studies [90] support extensive pre-clinical research [91], suggesting an impact of diet on the hippocampus. Fruit, vegetables, nuts, and wine in moderation have been associated with better metabolic health outcomes [92, 93], which share a common etiology with depression [94]. Those foods have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.",9f0abc56-a9ea-4902-bcf9-12579e2baa04
58,discussion3," Protection against oxidation can reduce neuronal damage due to oxidative stress [17]. Systemic inflammation can affect the brain by active transport of cytokines through the brain endothelium or activation of vagal fibers, and also plays a role in the regulation of emotions through mechanisms involving neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, and glutamate [60]. Our results show a consistent association between an inflammatory diet (measured by the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)) and incident depressive outcomes, which supports the hypothesis that avoiding pro-inflammatory foods in favor to anti-inflammatory diet might contribute to prevent incidence of depression and depressive symptoms. Finally, an extensive body of evidence now points to the microbiome-gut-brain axis as playing a key role in neuropsychiatry, and to the primacy of diet as a factor modulating this axis [95].",f9bca009-266f-4a90-bc02-56a5c15b2833
59,discussion4,"  Limitations  With depression being the psychiatric disorder incurring the largest societal costs in Europe, our study is part of an effort to gather evidence on the role of nutrition in depression, to help develop recommendations and guide future psychiatric health care. Recent reviews [16–19] paved the way and our results come to complement the previous studies by focusing on dietary indices that can have a direct application in clinical settings.  However, there are various methodological considerations that need to be taken into account when interpreting the results of this meta-analysis. First, despite defining strictly our outcome of interest to unipolar depression or depressive symptoms, there was heterogeneity across studies: most used questionnaires, in particular the CES-D, although differing versions, and some questionnaires were only used in a single study (MFQ [25], BDI [56]).",9493cf91-5fc5-4c91-9021-b8e641b8cd0c
60,discussion5," Only a minority of studies examined clinical depression [48, 58, 67, 71, 75, 79], assessed by clinical interview or self-reported physician diagnosis, complemented by the use of anti-depressants. Therefore, the accuracy of the prevalence or incidence may differ from one study to another. Moreover, depressive symptoms may be transient and are potentially reversible, whereas diagnosed depression is of greater severity, although they can also be reversible and transient. Our results show that most studies focused on depressive symptoms, but there is a lack of evidence for clinical depression.",cd20b849-437d-4125-b096-6ad087b0db7a
61,discussion6," The only studies included in the present review that used formal diagnosis of depression as an outcome are from the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra/University of Navarra follow up (SUN) cohort, which showed strong and robust associations with four different dietary indices [48, 67] except for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores [58], and three other studies that found no significant association with the Australian [71, 75] or with the Dutch [79] dietary guidelines scores. The meta-analysis conducted by Molendijk et al. found that there was no overall association between adherence to healthy dietary patterns and incidence of depression using a formal diagnosis as outcome [16], but this review included only three studies, one of which used internalizing disorder (not specifically depression) in children as outcome, so the comparability of these three estimates is problematic.",63e677cb-8b6e-429d-a36b-edb2b9623dd7
62,discussion7,"  Second, even under the same diet index name, the operationalization differed between studies depending on the dietary data available and how they were collected. It is common for large observational studies to collect self-reported dietary data with imperfect instruments such as food frequency questionnaires. These are associated with substantial measurement error, which can reduce the ability to detect associations [96]. Moreover, the majority of studies assessed diet at a single time point and did not take into account possible changes in diet quality over time that may be concomitant to the development of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, most studies compare extreme categories, e.g., top vs. bottom, but some used tertiles, others quartiles, or quintiles, making the comparisons less straightforward.",b359902c-3072-44d2-8f35-fdfdcbd2a534
63,discussion8," In contrast to other meta-analyses [16, 17], we presented global estimates of studies assessing the same dietary score, analyzed as categorical variable, and did not include studies assessing dietary scores as continuous variables, in order to provide more homogeneous results and an accurate quantification of the diet-depression relationship. Additionally, by presenting separate estimates according to the cross-sectional and longitudinal design of studies with long-term follow-up that should preclude reverse causality, and finding comparable results in both designs for most indices, our study provides support for an effect of overall diet on depression outcomes.  Third, we only included studies that used statistical adjustment (as opposed to simple mean comparisons between groups for instance). However, given the heterogeneity in the assessment of covariates, the comparability between studies is limited.",e2169f91-402f-47c5-9047-5ffab14c8d31
64,discussion9," All studies took age, sex (when relevant), energy intake and sociodemographic factors into account and the majority also included lifestyle factors and cardiometabolic markers; however, many of these used heterogeneous measures: some only adjusted for BMI, whereas others had a full cardiometabolic profile (blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, etc.). Also, a few studies did not include smoking nor physical activity [27, 52, 71, 76], which are common correlates to diet quality and therefore the “effect” of diet quality observed in these studies may be a proxy of a healthy overall lifestyle. However, most studies do adjust for other health behaviors and the weight of the data suggests that the relationship between diet quality and depression is independent of other health behaviors, as well as income, education, and body weight. The majority of longitudinal analyses investigated incident depression, i.e.",0997afb9-ce0d-4025-b7d8-73404b088c42
65,discussion10,", excluded prevalent depression at baseline, except three that only adjusted for baseline symptoms/use of antidepressants [25, 46, 71]. Some cross-sectional studies included anti-depressant use or history of depression as covariates [44, 54, 57, 59, 63, 78], but no clear trend was observed in terms of effect size or significance of the estimates produced when comparing these with the studies that did not.  Fourth, the vast majority of the studies included in this systematic review were conducted in high income countries (Australia, France, Greece, Ireland, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, UK, US), with only seven studied in low-and-middle income countries (Brazil [72] and Iran [49, 53, 54, 56, 59, 64]. Hence, the generalizability of the findings to low-and-middle income countries is limited. Moreover, we did not want to include an age limit and our systematic review includes three studies on adolescents [25, 49, 64].",2449b08f-eccc-4e8a-93b0-4a1394b23692
66,discussion11," Psychological disorders may express differently during adolescence as opposed to later in life, but the exclusion of those studies did not change the overall results and conclusions. Therefore, considering all the above limitations, extra care should be applied when using and interpreting the meta-analysis estimates.  Conclusions  Our review shows that there is observational evidence to suggest that both adhering to a healthy diet, in particular a traditional Mediterranean diet, and avoiding a pro-inflammatory diet is associated with reduced risk of depressive symptoms or clinical depression. That the majority of recovered studies were cross-sectional in design, with the problem of reverse causality being acute in the context of diet and depression, there is a clear need for more prospective studies.",8276b8c4-9911-48ef-adaa-322789c32f5d
