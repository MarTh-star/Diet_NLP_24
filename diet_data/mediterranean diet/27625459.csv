0,introduction0,"The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)) is increasing in parallel with higher rates of obesity, and older age at pregnancy [1,2]. The adoption of the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria (IADPSG criteria) for its diagnosis has also increased prevalence [3]. gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and higher risk for maternal Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) later in life. gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has become a major public health problem. Research into possible venues for its prevention thus becomes a priority.  Preventive strategies have been reviewed recently [4–9]. Several approaches have been studied to evaluate the effect of lifestyle interventions on the onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in high-risk women.",6fe8f797-84d4-45e3-8074-18a39e50efdb
1,introduction1," No prevention (4–7) and prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [8,9] results have been found, depending on the type of nutritional intervention used and the moment of its implementation.  A Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet), strengthened by the use of extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) and nuts, has been beneficial in preventing T2DM and cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) [10,11]. Moreover, MedDiet was retrospectively associated with a decreased risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [12]. Furthermore, adoption during the first gestational trimester of certain dietary patterns, clearly divergent from MedDiet principles, has been associated with a higher risk [13]. We have previously described an association of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) treatment with a reduction in obesity-induced adverse pregnancy and neonatal events [14].",4c4d42d9-fcf6-4abd-a890-57fdf8aad4e2
2,introduction2,"To date, no randomized clinical trials have assessed the effect of an early nutritional intervention with MedDiet on the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in unselected pregnant women.  The aim of this study was to assess the effect of an intervention based on MedDiet reinforced with abundant extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts in the form of pistachios on the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at 24–28 gestational weeks (GW).  Material and methods Ethics statement The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Clínico San Carlos (full protocol approved July 17, 2013 (CI 13/296-E) and conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration.

The follow up until delivery finished on July 2016.  Participants A total of 2418 women attending their first gestational visit at 8–12 GW (Visit 0) with fasting blood glucose (FBG) < 92 mg/dL were assessed for inclusion. They were invited to participate upon their first ultrasound visit, between 12–14 GW (Visit 1). Gestational age at entry for inclusion was based on the one obtained in this first ultrasound.

They were also recommended to walk ≥30 minutes/day. These recommendations were given to women by different parties, depending on the group they were allocated to.  In one hand, participants allocated to IG received lifestyle guidance from dieticians one week after inclusion in a unique 1-hour group session. The key IG recommendation was a daily consumption of at least 40 mL of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and a handful (25-30g) of pistachios.",51fb23e1-5b75-4515-8531-a2a4a71d7c58
6,introduction6," To ensure the consumption of the minimum amount recommended, women were provided at Visit 1 and 2 with 10 L of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and 2 Kg of roasted pistachios each. This way, they had available 1L of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and 150g of roasted pistachios weekly, throughout the pregnancy.  Women in the CG, however, were advised by midwives to restrict consumption of dietary fat, including extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts. These recommendations are provided in local antenatal clinics as part of the available guidelines in pregnancy standard care [15].  The number of visits for the study was alike in both groups. All women were followed-up taking advantage of their scheduled standard-practice laboratory appointments. This was at first ultrasound visit (Visit 1), at 24–28 GW (Visit 2), third trimester evaluation at 36–38 GW (Visit 3) and at delivery.

These recommendations were given in aims to reduce the caloric content of their diet when Gestational weight gain (GWG) exceeded the goal, by either the dietician (IG) or the midwife (CG).  Outcomes and data collection Study outcomes The primary outcome was to compare the effect of a standard diet versus MedDiet, supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and pistachios, on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) incidence at 24–28 GW, in pregnant women with a prior normal fasting glucose (<92 mg/dL) at the first gestational visit (8–12 GW).",c6e6dbd5-a98e-4064-bb9a-0a9d17d38070

These recommendations were the same for both groups of women, regardless of belonging to the CG or IG.  One-week after diagnosis at the very latest, women had their first appointment at the Diabetes and Pregnancy Unit. To register glycemic control, women were told to perform a six-point daily glycemic profile, with fasting/preprandial and 1-h postprandial glycemias. Insulin therapy was initiated when capillary blood glucose monitoring indicated that >50% of fasting or preprandial values were >95 mg/dL(basal insulin) or 1-h postprandial levels were >140 mg/dL (bolus insulin).

Lifestyle evaluation At each follow-up visit, dietary intake and physical activity were evaluated. A semi-quantitative frequency questionnaire, based on the Diabetes Nutrition and Complications Trial (Diabetes Nutrition and Complications Trial (DNCT)) study [17] and the 14-point Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) [18] were used. These were applied to questionnaires to obtain the Nutrition and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived PREDIMED score, respectively.",6d264b6b-b110-4035-b4c4-f39261df858e
14,introduction14,"  The Diabetes Nutrition and Complications Trial (DNCT) questionnaire contains 15 items and evaluates general healthy eating habits.  Three of the items consider physical activity and 12 assess the food frequency intake.  There are three options in the questionnaire: A, B and C. Option A (value +1) is associated with DM2 prevention while option C (value -1) is associated with increased risk. Therefore, A is the most favourable habit while C is the least favourable. Option B (value 0) is the intermediate between A and C, and is the minimum objective to be achieved. The Nutrition pattern is based on twelve questions. The score is between −12 and 12, and the objective is >5.  On the other hand, the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire considers 14 items and evaluates adherence to a MedDiet.

15,introduction15,"  Sample size For sample size calculation, the primary end-point was the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) from 24–28 GW. Assuming a decrease of median fasting blood glucose (fasting blood glucose (FBG)) of -7 mg/dL following 3 months of MedDiet [19], we estimated that 315 women would be required per group to provide statistical power of 80% (2-tailed, α error of 0.05). This was calculated in order to detect a relative risk reduction of at least 30%, with a projected incidence of 35% gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the control group [3]. Given possible losses to follow-up and discontinuation of the intervention, we included 1000 successive women that attended their first ultrasound visit, guaranteeing a minimum duration of 12-weeks of nutritional intervention.

22,discussion0,"This study shows that the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) can be reduced with an early-moderate nutritional intervention based on the supplementation of the MedDiet with an increased intake of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and pistachios. Other adverse outcomes were also significantly reduced. The intervention had a significant effect on the reduction of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) incidence considering it was applied in unselected pregnant women with a mean body mass index (BMI) <25kg/m2, considered as a low risk group. In addition, adjusted by body mass index (BMI) this issue remains to be significantly protective against gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).  In previous studies, some dietary interventions improved gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) incidence and maternal/neonatal outcomes [8,9] whereas others did not [4–7].",84c2d8d1-a202-4bd8-920b-480c6619176b
23,discussion1," This heterogeneity could be explained by differences in the characteristics of the study sample (high-risk women, its duration, when it was initiated, and/or the type of nutritional intervention. For instance, the UPBEAT [4] and RADIEL studies [8] were performed in women with a body mass index (BMI)≥30kg/m2, finding no reduction and reduction of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) incidence, respectively. On the other hand, the LIMIT trial [7] was performed in women with a body mass index (BMI)≥25kg/m2, and found no reduction in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) incidence. These sample characteristics are in contrast with the present study, that was based in an unselected sample of pregnant women with a mean body mass index (BMI) <25kg/m2. In addition, the intervention was implemented at a later stage of pregnancy [4] than that of ours and others [7,8]. Moreover, the types of intervention used were different to the present study.",76e16c78-5696-4ad8-8022-be5f9f0b2947
24,discussion2," Some studies based their recommendations on restriction of saturated fats and consumption of carbohydrates with a low-glycemic index [4,7]. Others [8] did provide recommendations similar to ours. However, they did not provide indications of specifically increasing extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts as well as providing them free supplies.  Therefore, none of the dietary recommendations provided in these interventions were founded in MedDiet principles supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts. In this respect, a single previous retrospective study found an association of adherence to a MedDiet with reduced gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) incidence [12].  The results of this study show that women in the IG gained less weight than the CG, the latter on a fat-restricted diet.",ac289fb6-3a6e-4d9c-bbe5-ae75a5c73cb0
25,discussion3," A significant reduction of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) incidence and overall Gestational weight gain (GWG) was also observed in other lifestyle intervention studies conducted in high-risk pregnant women [8,21–25].  Women in the IG had a lower risk for prematurity, in agreement with a recent metaanalysis [26]. urinary tract infections (UTI) events and perineal trauma were also less frequent as well as were emergency CS. The urinary tract infections (UTI) events were less frequent in women in the IG, in both women with NGT and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). EMER-CS was reduced with the intervention, mostly in women with NGT. The reduction in urinary tract infections (UTI) events could be because of the association between the MedDiet with an important role in inflammation and inmunomodulation. This effect is possibly derived from the presence of food components such as phenolic compounds and oleic acid [27].",e824713e-5595-4433-928c-43dfe51a8b3f
26,discussion4," Moreover, the reduction in rates of perineal trauma could be due to improvements in the delivery progress. It could also be due to the reduction of LGA newborns since this is a risk factor of perineal trauma [28]. In the IG, the rates of LGA were significantly lower than the CG. This could explain why rates of perineal trauma were also significantly lower in the IG. It could also vouch for the lower rates in EMER CS. LGA newborns is also one of the main risk factors of EMER CS. This aspect, in turn, is associated with maternal nutrition. Specifically, LGA is inversely associated with low-glycemic index diets, which happens to be a characteristic of MedDiets.  The most relevant neonatal outcomes were the improvements in rates of SGA and LGA newborns, also found by Luoto et al [29]. SGA is a consequence of placental insufficiency. The intervention provided in this RCT could have decreased the intrauterine growth retardation, as a consequence of improved placental health [30].",871ac757-308d-4cd4-9a06-07a9902ff947
27,discussion5," In addition, Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the IG needed less insulin treatment to achieve glycaemic goals. This means they had a lower risk of overtreatment, which could be accounted for the reduction in the rates of SGA.  Moreover, LGA is related to increased glucose transport from the mother to the fetus, and entails a greater fetal glycogen and triglyceride deposition. Thus, a reduction in maternal glycemia throughout the pregnancy would reduce fetal glycogen and triglyceride stores. Lower rates of LGA could be associated with a better glycaemic control and a lower mother-to-foetus glucose transmission. This effect could be more evident when glycemic control is achieved at an early stage of pregnancy. Therefore, the nutritional intervention reduces both extremes (SGA and LGA), without affecting the average weight of the newborn. A recent meta-analysis has also found improvements in maternal and neonatal outcomes.",6663b9e3-b40e-45df-8042-8e78ab9ab5b4
28,discussion6," Insulin requirements, rates of macrosomia and hypertensive disorders were reduced following nutritional counseling [31].  As expected, the intervention used in this study achieved adherence to MedDiet as shown by the Nutrition and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived PREDIMED score as well as by hydroxytyrosol and γ-tocopherol levels in the IG. The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived PREDIMED score improved throughout the pregnancy in the IG. Yet, an ideal score of ≥10 out of 14 points was not achieved. The original questionnaire considers moderate alcohol intake and juice consumption beneficial. However, pregnant women were advised not to consume either. This suggests that the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived PREDIMED score might need to consider a score ≥8 as the target during pregnancy, instead of ≥10.",e02cda1e-eb31-4316-9985-934b651c6d77
29,discussion7," The IG was more compliant with the MedDiet than the CG, but both seemed to improve their dietary lifestyle throughout pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. More women in the CG developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which could explain the enhancement of this group’s scores. One possible explanation is that the nutritional recommendations given for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) treatment are similar to the recommendations given to the IG.  Increased extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and pistachio consumption was clearly beneficial. extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids, and has been found to lower postprandial glucose levels [32] as well as to improve the inflammatory profile [33]. extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) could have limited weight gain by reducing the carbohydrate load of meals. Furthermore, its liberal use facilitates an increased intake of vegetables, traditionally eaten with olive oil in Spanish cuisine.",e54430d3-6d0a-4f35-b8e9-bd00709a920b
30,discussion8,"  Some clinical trials suggest that nuts facilitate weight loss within energy-restricted diets. It seems to be possibly due to enhanced satiety, increased thermogenesis, incomplete mastication and fat malabsorption [34,35]. Pistachios are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, fiber, magnesium, and other phytochemical constituents with potential beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity, fasting glucose levels and inflammation [34]. Their antioxidant capacity is higher than other nuts, given their high levels of lutein,β-carotene, and γ-tocopherol [35]. Pistachio consumption improves the inflammatory cytokine profiles linked to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) development [36].  The study is not free of limitations. Most women were of Caucasian ethnicity. Therefore, our results might not be extrapolated to other populations with a different ethnical distribution.",1b657e20-c061-470a-8104-eb16d90d8e2f
31,discussion9," Furthermore, the observed incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was lower than expected, reducing the statistical power for the primary outcome. According to the sample size obtained, the actual statistical power is 64%. However, the observed effect is maintained compared to that initially estimated (relative risk reduction of 30%). A higher sample size might have detected significant differences in other outcomes.  Together with its randomized design, the strengths of this study are its setting and the moderate intervention that reproduce real-life conditions. Furthermore, the follow-up throughout pregnancy permitted evaluation of maternal and fetal outcomes. Despite the low rates of overweight and obesity, the beneficial effect of the intervention persists being significant in relation to HbA1c levels. This tendency in other measured variables loses significance, probably due to sample size.",03ca4ca7-693c-47a5-bd96-886ba61aa33b
32,discussion10," In addition, when body mass index (BMI) is expressed as a continuous variable, all analyzed outcomes continue being significant. This might suggests that the intervention is as beneficial for overweight and obese women.  According to the data attained in this trial, limiting consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and pistachios is not suitable for pregnant women. Encouraging the consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and pistachios in a reasonable manner should be used as a tool to favour the adherence to a MedDiet. This could potentially prevent the onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and reduce its adverse outcomes.
