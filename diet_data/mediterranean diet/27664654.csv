0,introduction0,"Peripheral arterial disease (peripheral artery disease (PAD)) is an important marker of cardiovascular risk [1], and it is an indicator of widespread atherosclerosis in other vascular territories such as the coronary, carotid, and cerebrovascular arteries [2]. The annual mortality rate derived from epidemiological studies of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is high [3], with a combined event rate for myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular death of 4% to 5% per year [4].  The ankle–brachial index (ankle–brachial index (ABI)) is the ratio of the ankle to brachial systolic blood pressure, and a value of <0.90 indicates the presence of a flow-limiting arterial disease affecting the limb. The accuracy of the ankle–brachial index (ABI) for detecting ≥50% stenosis in the leg arteries is high (75% sensitivity and 86% specificity) [5].",5a319fe0-f177-4f68-a407-3cd8f21fe297
1,introduction1," The American Heart Association (American Heart Association (AHA)) Prevention Conference V highlighted the a low ankle–brachial index (ABI) is a consistent independent risk factor for cardiovascular events and mortality and recommended its use to detect subclinical peripheral artery disease (PAD) [2, 6] to offer early therapeutic interventions to lower the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality The prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) ranges between 1.8% and 25% according to the population studied and the cut-off value of the ankle–brachial index (ABI). In advanced countries it has reported to be 3–10% among those aged 40–70 years, and 10–20% among those over 70 years of age [7]. Data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (Multi Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)) showed that the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) was the same in men and women at 3.7%, but borderline values of ankle–brachial index (ABI) were significantly higher in women (10.6% vs.",84fc79e0-312b-4fbb-b91a-c6aaf848d793
2,introduction2," 4.3%) [8]. Likewise, the prevalence is higher in certain population subgroups such as diabetic patients [9] and smokers [10].  The Mediterranean Diet (MeDiet) is characterized by daily consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, moderate alcohol intake (1–2 glasses/d of wine), a moderate-to-low consumption of red meat, and a high monounsaturated–to–saturated fat ratio [11].  The PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)) study [12] showed for the first time under a randomized controlled trial design that a MeDiet supplemented with either extra-virgin olive oil or nuts is useful in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), peripheral artery disease (PAD), atrial fibrillation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in individuals at high risk.",1b51ac3f-5cc8-4ce8-abd9-f568a7f19532
3,introduction3," However, few studies carried out under clinical practice conditions have studied the role of MeDiet on peripheral artery disease (PAD), with unselected patients (with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD)) and with usual MeDiet consumption.  To date, five population-based studies [13–16] have been conducted in Spain, showing discordant results in peripheral artery disease (PAD) prevalence and associated factors, and none of them reported the influence of MeDiet. Furthermore, these studies were carried out in areas where the compliance to MeDiet is higher than in Madrid [17].  Moreover, serum uric acid is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events [18], but few studies have explored the possible relationship between serum uric acid levels and peripheral artery disease (PAD) [19]. This association is plausible given the previous evidence that serum uric acid may affect vascular endothelial function [20], although the association remains controversial [21].",3faae338-4e5d-40f8-91ea-0bcece89bef4
4,introduction4,"  Lastly, pulse pressure (PP; difference between systolic and diastolic pressures) has been included as a predictor of ankle–brachial index (ABI) <0.9 in the Spain REASON risk score, and a recently study using the NHANES data [22] has confirmed this issue. Adding pulse pressure to the periodic evaluation of high-risk patients might be a promising peripheral artery disease (PAD) surveillance instrument for the community-based population.  The objectives of the present study are to describe the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in a random population sample and to evaluate its relationship with MeDiet, and with other potential cardiovascular risk factors such as serum uric acid and pulse pressure in individuals older than 45 years.  Material and methods Design This study was conducted as part of a broader project, the Screening PRE-diabetes and type 2 DIAbetes (SPREDIA-2) study, which has been described in detail elsewhere [23].",227deaff-49e9-4939-ac8f-187bdd3bbfb2
5,introduction5," SPREDIA-2 is a population-based prospective cohort study in which baseline screening was performed from July 2010 to March 2014.  Subjects A total of 2,553 subjects were contacted. Potential participants were selected randomly from the electronic health records of all patients with health care coverage from two districts in the north metropolitan area of Madrid (Spain), namely, Fuencarral-El Pardo and Tetuán, which include three and seven primary health care centers, respectively. Of the 1,592 subjects (62.4%) who agreed to participate, 166 had been diagnosed with DM.  Those subjects not interested in participating were asked to report voluntary sociodemographic and clinical data, which revealed no significant differences in age, sex, or BMI. However, subjects in the participants group had a significantly greater family history of DM, hypertension and dyslipidemia compared with the non-participants group (S1 Table). The study procedure has been described in detail elsewhere [23].",97e69601-f58e-4e25-8923-1e4a19e982e5
6,introduction6," Briefly, recruitment was divided into three phases. First, the potential participants were sent a letter signed by their general practitioner explaining the objectives of the study and inviting them to participate. Second, subjects were contacted by phone to resolve doubts, and, if they were interested in participating, were given an appointment for the assessment. To minimize the losses attributable to failure to locate the patient, up to four telephone calls were made at different times and on different days. Third, the patient attended the assessment in the outpatient clinic of Carlos III Hospital after an overnight fast. Upon arrival, a fasting blood analysis was obtained by measuring blood levels of glucose, creatinine, serum uric acid, HbA1c, serum insulin, and lipids and lipoproteins.",6b0a08f8-b114-4e04-bce8-1c8e58e1ceba
7,introduction7," Immediately after blood sampling, all subjects with no previous diagnosis of diabetes underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) with 75 g of anhydrous glucose in a total fluid volume of 300 ml. A second blood sample was obtained 2 hours later.  Variables The ankle–brachial index (ABI) values were measured by nurses trained at the Section of Internal Medicine of The Carlos III Hospital and according to current recommendations [24]. The ankle–brachial index (ABI) measurements were performed with a bidirectional portable echo-Doppler of 8 MHz (Minidoppler HADECO ES-100, Kawasaki, Japan) and a calibrated sphygmomanometer. The systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) was measured in the posterior tibial and pedal arteries of both lower limbs and the brachial artery of both upper limbs.",846c8392-627e-41a2-8f5e-ea0e91f23a06
8,introduction8," The value of the ankle–brachial index (ABI) for each limb was calculated dividing the greater systolic blood pressure (SBP) obtained in each limb by the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of whichever was the higher in the upper limbs. The lowest value obtained was considered the ankle–brachial index (ABI) for that individual.  Sociodemographic variables, family history of prevalent diseases, cardiovascular risk factors (smoking habit, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia), clinical history of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), comorbidities, and current treatments were recorded for all individuals. Participants were considered as hypertensive when the arterial pressure was ≥140/90 mmHg. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as having LDL-cholesterol ≥100 mg/dl (2.57 mmol/l) and/or receiving hypolipidemic medication. The smoking habit included all who had consumed tobacco over the previous month.",6279a728-0f50-459b-be19-cbc5f898eda2
9,introduction9," A diabetes diagnosis was established when baseline glucose was ≥7 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) on two different occasions, or if the patient was receiving oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin. cardiovascular disease (CVD) included documented history of coronary heart disease (acute myocardial infarction, angina, coronary revascularization procedure), ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). All participants had a physical examination with determination of height, weight, waist circumference (midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest), and blood pressure. PP was calculated as the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures.  A previously validated 14-item MeDiet Assessment Tool was the method for assessing adherence to the MeDiet [25] where subjects were asked for their consumption of the most common Mediterranean foods (S2 Table). The total score ranges from 0 to 14. Each item was scored 0 (non-compliant) or 1 (compliant) [26].",7a5e7273-4fee-4f82-a89f-2d8ca7429ccf
10,introduction10, Higher scores reflected better adherence. High adherence was defined as meeting at least 11 of the 14 items [27].  Cholesterol and triglycerides were determined by enzymatic assays. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) was calculated according to the Friedewald formula (LDL-cholesterol = total cholesterol—([high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol) + triglycerides/5]) in subjects with triglycerides below 400 mg/dl. HDL-cholesterol was measured after precipitation of apo-B lipoproteins. Glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method. HbA1c was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)) method. Uric acid was measured by the uricase method. ,2bcb720d-e4cf-4dbe-91d7-9efe7843a6dd

20,discussion0,"The results of our study show that the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) is low in comparison with other international population-based studies [28], but similar to that found in the Hermex Study carried out in Badajoz (Spain) [29]. A recent systematic review for Peripheral Arterial Disease Research Coalition including 34 community-based studies [30] evidenced that prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) ranged between 7.3–11.8% for women aged 50–74 years and between 6.4–12.1% for men aged 50–74 years among high-income countries. Spain belongs to the high-income countries category, and for this reason, one might expect a higher prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, a “Spanish paradox” has been described as a phenomenon by which the cardiovascular morbidity (myocardial infarction stroke and peripheral artery disease (PAD)) and mortality levels are dissociated from their cardiovascular risk factors.",fe14c3e3-ba18-495a-8661-b1042699527c
21,discussion1," The existence of protector factors such as MeDiet and its interaction with different genetic patterns [31] has been argued as a plausible explanation of this phenomenon.  Furthermore, other Spanish population-based studies have shown peripheral artery disease (PAD) prevalence ranging from 4.5% [13] to 10.5% [16]. The prevalence was higher in men than in women for all Spanish studies. Nevertheless, some community-based studies have shown a higher prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in women compared with men [32–35], even in each decade of life [33]. These findings raise concerns about whether there should be differences in the definition of normal ankle–brachial index (ABI) values between men and women, and therefore whether the diagnostic criteria of peripheral artery disease (PAD) should be based on a cut-off ankle–brachial index (ABI) value different to the currently accepted as standard.",2ea21262-550d-4b08-ab86-761877b1634b
22,discussion2,"  It is commonly accepted that men have a higher prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) than women until the seventh decade of life [16, 29, 36]. However, in our study, the peripheral artery disease (PAD) prevalence was lower in women in comparison with men for each age group. Also, we found an inverse relationship between peripheral artery disease (PAD) and advancing age among women. We have no strong explanation for this finding, in which chance could indeed be playing a role.  The direct association between adherence to MeDiet and peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an unexpected phenomenon, given the strong evidence of the reduction of risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD) with the daily consumption of MeDiet [37]. Some aspects may explain our results.",5c24d494-3357-4a16-b182-e81c4ce27b54
23,discussion3," Firstly, the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) Randomized Trial compared two groups of MeDiet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and nuts, respectively, with a group who received counseling on a low-fat diet (control group), and all groups received a comprehensive dietary educational program based on individual and group sessions with a dietitian every 3 months designed to increase adherence to the MeDiet or a low-fat diet. The use of the 14-point MeDiet questionnaire proved very useful because the results formed the basis for personalized advice on changes the participant should make to acquire a traditional MeDiet or low-fat diet pattern. However, in the present study, no person received counseling and/or supplements of diet. Quite simply, we merely asked them for their consumption of MeDiet using the 14-point MeDiet questionnaire. These differences might help explain our findings.",b39ee77a-296d-473f-973d-c994b65757c6
24,discussion4," Secondly, as it is well known, a cross-sectional study like ours does not allow the establishment of a causal relationship between MeDiet and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Thus, patients with baseline known peripheral artery disease (PAD) might have initiated MeDiet as part of their treatment, given that these individuals with known peripheral artery disease (PAD) had high vascular morbidity and a trend to show a better adherence to MeDiet compared with those without peripheral artery disease (PAD). Thirdly, is plausible that those patients with known peripheral artery disease (PAD) and those with compatible symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD) (i.e. intermittent claudication) would tend to conserve healthier diets like the MeDiet whereas the population with a good perception of their health would lead to a progressive abandonment of the MeDiet, due to the economic crisis.",8444ce80-9c0e-465c-b7c7-47ec4506e790
25,discussion5," This phenomenon has been detected in Italy, with a dramatic fall in the adherence to MeDiet, lowering the adherence from over 30% to 18% in the whole population with the global economic crisis [38]. This hypothesis might partially explain the results obtained here.  The positive association between smoking status and peripheral artery disease (PAD) is well established, and it is habitually found in the vast majority of studies [14, 16, 30, 34]. Our study is consistent with these findings, but shows slight differences in the peripheral artery disease (PAD) prevalence between current and former smokers in the case of men. These findings are concordant with a recent systematic review of 34 studies [30]. However, other studies in our country showed greater differences between both levels of smoking status [14].

26,discussion6,"1 mg/dl and peripheral artery disease (PAD) is congruent with previous studies in adults with high cardiovascular risk [39, 40] and among the general population [41]. Serum uric acid has been found to be associated with several inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 [42]. Furthermore, hyperuricemia has been reported as a factor responsible for cardiovascular diseases through endothelial dysfunction caused by inactivation of nitric oxide, which is a potent vasodilator [43], and arresting the proliferation of endothelial cells [44].  However, it is well known that there is a high correlation between serum uric acid and glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate (GFR)), strengthening the possibility that Chronic Kidney Disease (Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)) status may be a statistical confounder in the relationship between uric acid and cardiovascular disease, rather than the mediator [45].",9db8fd0e-f73e-4957-9315-7424ef047ecf
27,discussion7," In recent years, a better understanding of uric acid metabolism suggests that Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) may be an intermediate step between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular disease, and increased levels of uric acid are, at once, a dependent and independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression [46].  As large-artery stiffness increases in middle-aged and elderly subjects, systolic blood pressure (SBP) rises, and DBP falls, with a resulting increase in PP [47]. A series of prospective and cross-sectional studies have shown that PP is associated with cardiovascular events [47–49] and mortality [47, 50–51]. Interest has been increasing on the association between PP and peripheral artery disease (PAD). In this line, previous studies have shown an association between PP and peripheral artery disease (PAD) [52–54].",27937bd4-73ad-408a-bb89-5a5e212a9b46
28,discussion8," Our results are in accordance with these findings, but our study was carried out in a general population rather than a population with a high risk of cardiovascular disease as other studies [55,56]. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis based in subjects free of cardiovascular disease has shown a tendency, though not statistically significant, to a higher proportion of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) for each 10 mmHg increase in PP [57].  To our knowledge, this is the second study that has shown an association between high heart rate and peripheral artery disease (PAD). In The MERITO Study [58], for each increase in the heart rate of one beat per minute, the OR for peripheral artery disease (PAD) was 1.02 (96% CI, 1.01–1.03). Resting heart rate has been associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [59,60]. Some studies have found indirect associations between heart rate and peripheral artery disease (PAD).",3c2bccc6-496b-4f18-85b5-6e37eb4a16d5
29,discussion9," So, resting heart rate ≥77 beats/min has been associated with frailty in older men (age-adjusted OR = 1.90; 95%CI, 1.30–2.48) [61] and frailty is strongly associated with subclinical peripheral artery disease (PAD) (ankle–brachial index (ABI)<0.8) (OR = 3.56; 95%CI, 2.03–6.24) [62].  A practical application of our findings is that heart rate>90 beats/min and a serum uric acid above 6.1 mg/dl could be two factors to consider in selecting patients to screen for peripheral artery disease (PAD), regardless of gender, age and diabetes status. Nevertheless, this proceeding requires caution because the pathophysiological basis of the relationship between resting heart rate and peripheral artery disease (PAD) is still unknown.  Other known factors firmly established to increase the risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD), such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia were not associated in the multivariate analysis with the presence of a low ankle–brachial index (ABI).",c01ce824-f0c3-45f8-b9ee-9acd3c4e447b
30,discussion10," This is a phenomenon already observed in other studies [58, 63, 64], and may be due to the known limitations of cross-sectional studies, the lack of a sufficient number of cases of the disease or the exclusion of persons with an ankle–brachial index (ABI) >1.5, who are more likely to have diabetes mellitus.  Concerning to the limitations of the study, the cross-sectional design did not allow determination of the causal effect of variables studied with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Also, women were more likely to participate than men, as usually occurs in population-based studies. This aspect would limit the inference of the results to the entire population. Also, our findings about the magnitude of the association between both serum uric acid and high heart rates with peripheral artery disease (PAD) could have been affected by a potential residual confounding by unknown or misspecified confounding variables.",28a9b012-46d8-445d-86b0-93d10b3c6503
31,discussion11,"  The study presents some strengths consisting of having collected epidemiological information on the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in a sample of a wide range of ages, representative of the general population and from a region of our country with high prevalence of risk factors. Having used the same methodology as in other published population-based studies allows comparability to these.  In conclusion, our results demonstrate the existence of a low prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in a population aged 45–74 years. Serum uric acid, pulse pressure and heart rate >90 bpm were strongly associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The direct association between MeDiet and peripheral artery disease (PAD) that we have found should be further evaluated through a follow-up study under clinical practice conditions.
