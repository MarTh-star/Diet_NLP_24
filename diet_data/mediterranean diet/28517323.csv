0,results0,Study participation A total of 59 potentially eligible people were invited to participate in Brainfood and expressed an initial interest during the study period. Thirty (51%) of these people attended the initial or second Brainfood session. All were screened as being potentially eligible and 26 (87%) agreed to take part in the study and completed baseline measures. The four attendees who did not take part arrived late and were either not invited to take part because S.H. had left the clinic or did not want to complete the questionnaires before the session because they would miss the group that was already underway. Of 26 participants at baseline 25 (96%) completed all post-intervention quantitative measures; one participant refused to complete either follow-up interview. Participation rates were broadly similar between memory service one and memory service two.,08dd6425-a017-46dc-ad57-5cbc08a3d2fc
1,results1,"  Of the participants, 17 (65%) attended sessions alone; 8 (31%) attended with a family member (7 with a spouse and one with an adult child), of whom 4 had a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 4 had a diagnosis of dementia. For one participant, the family carer attended sessions alone, and proxy-completed the questionnaires on behalf of the person they were caring for who had dementia.  Intervention participation Groups took place between January and August 2017. In total, 21 of the 26 (81%) participants attended at least three out of the five sessions. Five people attended two sessions, four people attended three sessions, seven people attended four sessions and ten people attended five sessions. We recruited 14 (54%) of participants from memory service one (in which the participants took part in three cohorts each with five, three and six participants) and the remaining 12 (46%) from memory service two, who took part as one group.",09f6649a-78c4-4e45-b60f-5081a4a90b08
2,results2,"  Participant characteristics Thirteen (50%) of participants had a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 12 (46%) had a diagnosis of dementia and one (4%) participant did not consent to us obtaining clinical information from medical records. For those for whom their Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III score was available in the last year before baseline, the mean score was 82.9 (s.d. = 10.2, n = 11) in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 79.7 (s.d. = 12.7, n = 10.2) in participants with dementia; the overall range of scores was 50–95. Thirteen (50%) participants were women. In total, 5 (19%) were attending Cognitive Stimulation Therapy at baseline; and 8 (31%) were taking antidementia medication at baseline.  Quantitative outcomes We log-transformed data on the amount of exercise taken and Geriatric Depression Scale scores, and resulting data was within our predetermined limits for conducting parametric analyses (skewness >−1 and <1) (Table 1).",6e69ecd4-7ab1-4f42-a5e3-c513512ed6ec
3,results4," Geriatric Depression Scale scores did not change significantly over these time periods.  Lifestyle measures Post-intervention, 21 (84%) of participants with data reported that they had made changes because of Brainfood, and the same participants reported that they had sustained these changes 2 months later. Mediterranean diet scores increased significantly between baseline and post-intervention and 2-month follow-up, indicating greater adherence to Mediterranean diet over time (Table 1). In a post hoc analysis, greater mean change on the Mediterranean diet score was reported by people with dementia compared with those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (3.7 v. 0.9) and by those attending with a carer (2.8 v. 1.5).  Walking, dancing and flexibility exercises were the main types of exercise reported. The amount of exercise reported increased from baseline to 2 months follow-up, but not between baseline and the immediate post-intervention.",1b4fcdc0-2ddb-496b-ade4-79467fa1498c
4,results5," At baseline, 17 (65%) of participants drank no alcohol, 7 drank between one and ten units of alcohol a week, and two did not answer. None of the participants reported increased alcohol intake at subsequent post-intervention or 2-month follow-ups.  Process evaluation and qualitative analysis Of the 26 participants, 16 (62%) responded to the qualitative questions at the first follow-up and 12 of 21 (57%) responded to the qualitative questions at both follow-up points; with other respondents leaving the questions blank or writing ‘none’. Data saturation was attained with no new themes arising in the final three questionnaires analysed.  We identified nine subthemes, which we fitted within five themes informed by Pender's health promotion model: personal characteristics, perceived benefits to action, perceived self-efficacy, interpersonal and situation influences and behavioural outcomes.",a507eb43-985b-45ec-b136-ff4495dbf13a

9,results10, Three participants (including people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia) indicated that the extent to which the sessions changed their behaviour was limited by the degree of accord between lifestyle changes suggested and their current practices.  Perceived benefits of action Several of the participants reported that the groups increased their awareness of the perceived benefits of the targeted behaviour changes. This was most frequently discussed in relation to dietary change. One participant with dementia explained they were more aware of the ‘impact of varied and healthy foods on memory and well-being’ after attending the groups. A second participant with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) reported increased awareness of the importance of ‘variation in diet’.,6f33539e-d7f9-4e06-8870-d5064994d11f
10,results11,"  Perceived self-efficacy Narratives of participants (at first (FU1) and second follow-up (FU2)) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia suggested that the groups had increased their understanding of diet as an active choice. One person with dementia spoke of how they understood more about the benefits of different food choices: ‘Understanding greatly increased the choices to include in eating and the benefits they make.’ (FU1)  A participant with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) spoke of an intention to use the manuals as a resource when planning diet: ‘I will keep my 5 booklets and refer to them to enable me to correct my diet.’ (FU1)  One participant described (at both time points) how the groups had led to an understanding that despite having a cognitive disorder, they could still make changes that could improve their well-being: ‘My attitude to what is still possible despite my medical condition.",587e8bc0-4763-4a48-86f7-23ed1cdedd65

12,results13,"’ (FU2)    Behavioural outcomes Participants described making changes to how they ate, with participants with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) making references to having more home-cooked meals and enjoying learning how to implement their understanding from the group in the meals they cooked: ‘Enjoyed Mediterranean food throughout life but was nice to learn about how to incorporate it for home cooked meals.’ (FU1)  One participant with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) also described seeking out new places to buy food: ‘Familiarised myself with healthy food suppliers.’ (FU1)    Most (n = 15) participants described making and sustaining dietary changes recommended in the groups. For example, a participant with dementia described the following dietary changes: ‘Cut down on sugar. Pumpkin seeds, nuts instead of sweets, cut down on sugar, much more lemon.’ (FU1)  One participant mentioned ‘joining the gym’, and another described how mindfulness ‘helped with sleep’.

13,discussion0,"Main findings The Brainfood group intervention was accepted by participants, most of whom reported positive behaviour changes. Dietary change was most targeted in the groups, and most reported behaviour change was in this area. Facilitators of change appeared to be an increasing awareness of how the targeted lifestyle changes might improve their well-being, increased self-efficacy and awareness of diet being an active choice, which can influence well-being and positive social experiences in the group. In quantitative analyses, we found that reported Mediterranean-style dietary adherence, exercise and health-related quality of life increased compared with baseline up to 2 months follow-up post-intervention. Changes in depression scores over time were not significant but in the expected direction. Over half of the potential participants who expressed an interest in attending did so, and 80% of study participants attended three of five groups.",3ab83988-e7a9-4c17-bcc0-576edf259078
14,discussion1," As many faced barriers to attending including memory loss, physical illness and difficulties arranging transport (on one site), this is promising.  Interpretation of our findings Although our findings must be interpreted cautiously in this small, uncontrolled study, they suggest that the groups may have enabled meaningful lifestyle changes. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to evaluate an intervention to enable behaviour change in people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), without a regular family carer acting as study partner. Even without a family carer to support implementation, people with mild dementia appeared able to use the sessions to make changes to lifestyle; our experiences suggested that the intervention manual was important in enabling this.",d3db0815-adbb-4bc2-9064-742c36d9247b
15,discussion2," We cannot determine the mechanisms, but previous studies report that Mediterranean diet29 and increased exercise30 are associated with increased quality of life, possibly mediated by improved physical, mental or social well-being or increased self-efficacy.31 The intervention involved supporting participants to make choices and personal plans for change. Perhaps this approach communicated that independence is possible despite memory loss. Participants valued the social experience. Where family carers attended, their experiences may have influenced the care recipients’ quality of life as family carer and care recipient quality of life are interlinked.32 We did not measure family carer quality of life and would do so in a future trial.",22b02a7b-ad33-4d0b-9288-3dfc4167cf5a
16,discussion3,"  A systematic review of eight interventions to promote healthy diet in older people without cognitive impairment found that interventions involving more than one session and focusing on specific changes, for example increasing fruit and vegetable intake were more effective. Only three of the interventions reviewed were explicitly based on a health promotion theory; these included Pender's health promotion model.27 In our framework analysis based on Pender's model, we identified that perceived benefits, self-efficacy and interpersonal relationships were likely drivers of the behavioural outcomes we recorded. Pender's model also includes barriers to behavioural change, but we did not identify description of barriers to action in the participants’ responses.",9c91bd62-2a4d-44d8-8b6f-c31d117dfaf7
17,discussion4," Perhaps people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) attending groups and responding to the open-ended questions experienced fewer barriers to implementing recommended changes than those who did not attend or respond, or perhaps our open-ended questions did not adequately prompt participants to report them.  Strengths and limitations This was an exploratory, pilot study designed to work within current National Health Service (NHS) service provision, with broad inclusion criteria and brief outcome interviews. There was no control group. Outcome measures were self-completed, but may have been influenced by social desirability bias. Some participants attended with family members who were usually present when they completed measures and may have influenced ratings or assisted recall. In one case, a family carer attended alone and proxy completed the measures.",7912c836-8067-46d8-a9aa-625c20400244
18,discussion5," There are systematic differences in how family carers and people living with dementia rate quality of life,33 so this is a limitation. We think that opening this trial to people with and without a family carer was also a strength, as people with dementia without a family carer are rarely included in research developing interventions designed for them to use.34 Although the follow-up period was too brief to evaluate changes in cognitive function, this would be an important outcome in a future trial, as higher Mediterranean dietary adherence is associated with a reduced dementia risk.35  Implications Our intervention was conceived because people with mild dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) attending our memory services wanted more information about how lifestyle changes might improve their symptoms, so we included both these diagnostic groups in the study.",0d3abfd9-e683-40e1-807c-9cdd1c745a47
19,discussion6," The Mediterranean diet score has been used in populations with cognitive impairment,23 but not in people with mild dementia. Participants with mild dementia had similar cognitive function to those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but a more homogenous population would arguably be preferable in a future pragmatic study as mechanisms for enabling behavioural change may differ in people with dementia who were by definition experiencing functional impairment. In our post hoc analysis, Mediterranean diet adherence increased more in people with mild dementia compared with those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We focused the intervention on how to help cognitive symptoms rather than on diagnosis. Perhaps participants with mild dementia particularly benefited from this approach because promoting self-efficacy and independence challenges the commonly held belief that as cognitive decline in dementia is inevitable, it is too late to make positive life changes.",c278e6df-2fb3-46c8-9a29-18a26fe82571
20,discussion7," Perhaps people with dementia were more highly motivated to change, or their carers were more motivated to support them to implement changes.  Brainfood groups were offered in additional to all available usual care. There are no other groups routinely available in either trust that specifically promote Mediterranean dietary adherence or exercise, which were our main outcomes of behavioural change, so we do not think that attendance at other groups could have accounted for the changes we saw on these measures. We recorded and report attendance at cognitive stimulation groups at baseline, as these were the only groups offered (only to people with dementia) within the clinical services involved in the study during the study period.",f7c5422f-160e-4310-a015-b52c375f3a63
21,discussion8,"  In conclusion, this pilot study demonstrated that Brainfood, a psychosocial intervention to promote healthy diet, exercise and mindfulness in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia was feasible to implement in a real-world National Health Service (NHS) setting. Dietary change was most targeted in the groups, and most reported behaviour change was in this area. Facilitators of change appeared to be an increasing awareness of how the targeted lifestyle changes might improve their well-being, increased self-efficacy and awareness of diet being an active choice, which can influence well-being and positive social experiences in the group. Evaluation of the intervention in a randomised controlled trial is now planned.
