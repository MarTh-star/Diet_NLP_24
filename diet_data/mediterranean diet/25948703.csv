0,background0,"Older adults, aged 60 years and over, represent the fastest growing segment of the global population with numbers projected to reach 1.5 billion by year 2050 [1]. This unprecedented trend of population aging in today’s world necessitates a reduction in the burden of diseases and disabilities to ensure longer and healthier lives [1, 2]. Healthy or ‘successful’ aging represents a state of resilience whereby cognitive and physical functioning is maintained and the risk of chronic diseases is reduced [3]. Proper nutrition is one of the main behavioral and modifiable determinants of healthy aging and is integral in reducing disease risk and maintaining functional independence, especially among older adults who undergo a variety of physiological, psychological, and social changes that affect their nutritional status.",233b3fc2-c68e-4b77-8f2e-881e4d5e1654
1,background1," These changes include alterations in appetite hormone levels, reduced gastrointestinal digestive and absorptive capacities, increased feelings of loneliness and depression among other complex biological, metabolic, and environmental factors [1, 4]. Numerous cross-sectional and cohort studies elucidate the strong association between adequate nutrition and reduced risk of diet-related chronic diseases [5, 6] with more emphasis being placed over the last few years on improvements in health-related quality of life parameters through diets of good quality [7–10].  Traditionally, diet quality has been assessed by comparing dietary intake of single nutrients or specific foods to dietary references.",40b79531-b412-4127-a273-95a30812056e
2,background2," However, given that individuals consume foods, and foods are a combination of nutrients that may interact closely to affect health outcomes, recently nutrition epidemiologists have been assessing dietary quality through dietary patterns (DPs) looking beyond the intake of single nutrients or food items to characterize whole diets and habitual food consumption. Two approaches commonly used to assess dietary patterns are the a priori- and a posteriori- methods. The a priori-defined dietary patterns are based on compliance to pre-set international or national dietary recommendations and guidelines that have been associated with positive health outcomes [11]. Using this method, the diet can be assessed based on frequency of consumption of certain food and/or nutrients resulting in a scoring system that is operationalized as a diet quality index (diet quality index (DQI)) [11, 12].",2bd6423c-0f84-4e17-ab98-0ba150524f8c
3,background3," Examples of commonly used diet quality index (DQI)s are the Healthy Eating Index [13], the Alternative Health Eating Index (Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)) [5], the Mediterranean Diet Score [14], and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) [15]. The a posteriori-defined dietary patterns (DPs), on the other hand, are not pre-defined but rather based on empirical data of populations under study and are derived through sophisticated statistical techniques, such as factorial or cluster analyses [12, 16]. These empirical methods allow for identifying culture and context-specific DPs based on combination of food items as consumed by the population under study.",4fa9a006-eeb5-461e-9ffd-de9040040ad9
4,background4," Empirically-derived DPs, most commonly reported in the nutrition literature, are the ‘prudent’ DP, characterized by high intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and poultry; and the ‘Western’ pattern that is characterized by high intakes of refined cereals, sweets and desserts, as well as red and processed meats [16].  Lebanon, a small Eastern Mediterranean country, is undergoing a similar demographic transition as that seen worldwide with projections showing that older adults are expected to constitute 10 % of the population by 2025 [17]. Concomitantly, the country is witnessing increased prevalence of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases among various population groups, including middle-aged and older adults [18–20]. Despite the population ageing phenomena observed in Lebanon and the important role that nutrition plays in the prevention and treatment of diet-related diseases, limited studies examined diet quality of community-dwelling older adults [21].",f55dd744-7edb-4fea-8e06-df1349d90353
5,background5," Non-institutionalized older adults in Lebanon are vulnerable to malnutrition and inadequate dietary intake due to their limited access to health care services and social welfare programs as well as inadequate living conditions; however this group still receives minimal research attention. The proposed study aims to (i) identify and characterize dietary patterns of Lebanese older adults, (ii) evaluate the identified DPs in relation to diet quality indices, and (iii) examine socio-demographic factors and lifestyle behaviors as correlates of the identified DPs.

This sample was drawn from randomly selected households, based on stratified cluster sampling: the strata were the Lebanese Governorates and the clusters were selected further at the level of districts covering urban and rural areas. Households constituted the primary sampling units in the different districts of Lebanon. One adult from each household was selected from the household roster. The distribution of the national survey sample by sex and 5-year age group was similar to that of the Lebanese population as estimated by the Central Administration for Statistics in Lebanon (2004). Out of 3178 eligible subjects approached, 2836 accepted to participate (response rate 89.2 %).",25a277af-c4cb-4b93-92f4-907148aa9bc7

During face-to-face interviews, study participants completed a brief socio-demographic and lifestyle questionnaire and a semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)). Interviews were conducted by trained dietitians and took place at the participants’ homes. Further details about the survey and data collection procedures were described elsewhere [22]. Socio-demographic and lifestyle information collected through the questionnaires included age (years), sex, education (illiterate, less than high school, high school or diploma, university level), marital status (single including single, divorced, separated and widowed, and married including currently married or living with a partner), and crowding index. The latter is a composite variable composed of the number of household members as the numerator and the number of rooms used for sleeping as the denominator.",32a38299-0b56-4fee-8e74-d419ed6288b4
8,methods2," Several epidemiological studies have correlated a high household crowding index with low socioeconomic status (socioeconomic status (SES)) [23]. Smoking status was either labeled as smokers (current smokers) or non-smokers (current non-smokers and past smokers). Physical activity was assessed using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)). Three categories of physical activity were assigned based on METS-min per week (low: less than 600, moderate: at least 600, and high: at least 3000) [24]. In addition, participants answered questions related to the presence of chronic diseases and their family history of chronic diseases, including obesity, heart diseases, hypertension and diabetes (a positive family history was indicated if the mother, father or both were reported as having the chronic disease).  Anthropometric measurements were taken using standardized techniques and calibrated equipment.",777daaf7-fbc5-4a66-8ca7-63ece46311b6
9,methods3," Subjects were weighed to the nearest 0.1 kg in light indoor clothing and with bare feet or stockings. Using a stadiometer, height was measured without shoes and recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as the ratio of weight (kilograms) to the square of height (meters). Waist circumference was measured using a plastic measuring tape, to the nearest 0.5 cm, at the midpoint between the bottom of the rib cage and above the top of the iliac crest during minimal respiration. Elevated waist circumference, reflecting central obesity, was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation (International Diabetes Federation (IDF)) cut-off values (WC ≥ 94 cm for males and ≥ 80 cm for females) [25]. Percent body fat was computed using skinfold thickness measurements according to the Durnin and Womersley formula [26].",70e9390b-bcf6-4cd8-834a-26d42d82d2bd

The sex-specific cut-off points of 25 and 32 % body fat were used to indicate adiposity in men and women, respectively [25, 27].  Dietary intake of participants was assessed by a 61-item semi-quantitative, context-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that has been used in previous studies among the Lebanese population and has yielded plausible results and findings [28, 29]. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) referred to food intake one year prior to the interview, and for each food item listed, a standard portion size was indicated, and subjects were asked to record the frequency of consumption (open-ended) either per day, per week, per month, per year or never.",3399d589-bea7-4b35-89cc-657e50e062a6
11,methods5," Daily gram intakes of food items as well as the energy and nutrient composition of foods were computed using the food composition database of the Nutritionist IV software and the food composition table for local and traditional Middle-Eastern foods [30, 31]. food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used in the present study was administered by a trained dietitian and not self-completed. Such a modality of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) completion does not require a literate population, resulting in consistent interpretations, and higher response and completion rates, each of which may enhance the validity of the data. Breakfast frequency was also investigated in this study as it was shown to be associated with improved daily nutrition intake and reduced risks of obesity and type II diabetes among older adults [32].",32acc744-af6d-478e-af5b-25fdad6987fd

The number of factors retained was based on three criteria: 1) the Kaiser criterion (eigenvalues >1), 2) inflection point of the scree plot 3) and the interpretability of factors. The factors were rotated by a Varimax rotation (orthogonal transformation). The derived DPs were labeled based on food groups having a rotated factor loading greater than 0.4 [34].

Three DPs were identified in this study: a Western, a Lebanese, and a High Protein/Alcohol pattern. Together, these three patterns explained 25.5 % of the variance in the dietary intake of study participants, which was comparable to the explained variance identified in previous studies ranging between 15 and 43 % [6, 10]. The food constituents of the Western pattern identified in this study were similar to those typically reported in westernized DPs, such as refined grains, fried potato, fast food, sweets and soda beverages [10, 36–38]; yet the eggs, red and processed meats, as well as alcohol were part of the High Protein/Alcohol pattern, as seen in other studies [39, 40].",f1f92e5a-2831-4049-8914-52b0c256027a

In addition, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds have been considered as protective dietary factors associated with lower cardio-metabolic mortality in countries of the Middle East and North Africa (Middle East and North Africa (MENA)) region [43]. Furthermore, these food groups have been established as key ingredients for healthy aging and longevity through being consistently associated with better cardiometabolic and cognitive health parameters [11].

In addition, this pattern had the lowest correlations with a number of diet quality index (DQI)s, including Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and aMED, compared to the Lebanese and Protein/Alcohol patterns. In fact, the Western pattern derived in the present study shared comparable food compositions with the ‘fast food/dessert’ and ‘refined grains & desserts’ patterns identified earlier among Lebanese adults (>18 years old), which in turn were similarly associated with high energy consumption, low fiber intake, and irregular breakfast consumption [6, 44].

Furthermore, energy-dense foods and beverages consumed within the westernized DP are known to be of lower nutritional quality prohibiting its consumers, particularly older adults, from meeting their dietary requirements [10, 46].  In contrast to the Western DP, the Lebanese reflected characteristics of a healthy pattern as it had positive correlations with all diet quality index (DQI)s considered in the study and had the highest correlations with a number of micronutrients, namely fiber, folate, and vitamin C.",d2e67d74-3515-4051-8183-b803d8db971a
28,discussion4," Research shows that the Lebanese pattern, comprised mainly of fruits, vegetables, bulgur, dried fruits, legumes, and olive oil, shares common features with the Mediterranean DP [28]; the latter being well-established as a ‘healthy’ pattern that is associated with improved diet quality [47] and reduced risk of diet-related chronic diseases [48–50]. A previous study conducted in Lebanon on rural adults aged 40–60 years showed that the Mediterranean diet was negatively associated with abdominal obesity; however researchers noticed an overall low adherence to the Mediterranean DP among their study participants [51]. These findings were further validated by Belahsen et al. [52], who reported that populations living in Southern Mediterranean countries, including Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, are gradually moving away from their traditional healthy Mediterranean diets and transitioning towards inadequate dietary intakes and more sedentary behaviors [52].",aab0e443-4b43-4882-a389-768fbe354f25
29,discussion5," Rapid urbanization and increased availability and access to industrial food are indicated as the major culprits of this nutrition and health transition [28]. In addition to these factors, older adults face a myriad of economic, social, and environmental challenges, such as poverty, food insecurity, and limited access to social safety net programs [4, 53–55], all of which may further limit their ability to consume diets of good quality.  Multiple linear regression results in this study revealed that the strongest correlates of the Lebanese pattern are female gender, higher education, and physical activity level. In addition, higher crowding index, indicative of lower socioeconomic status (SES), and smoking were found to be negatively associated with the Lebanese pattern. The Western pattern, on the other hand, was found to be associated with male gender, higher crowding index, low education, and other unfavorable lifestyle behaviors.",f58bb5de-4733-4422-874a-da9d3f39294a
30,discussion6," These findings confirm previously reported positive associations between higher education and income with ‘healthy’, ‘prudent’, and Mediterranean DPs [29, 41, 56]. This could be explained by the fact that those with higher education tend to be more health conscious, motivated, and have increased nutrition knowledge to seek and adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors. Furthermore, adults with high socioeconomic status (SES) may have the purchasing power needed to access healthy and nutritious food as well as the means to be engaged in more active lifestyles [29, 41, 56, 57]. According to previous studies conducted on middle-aged and older adults, women tend to adhere more to healthy patterns compared to men [58, 59] and are more likely to adopt better lifestyle behaviors, such as lower consumption of dietary cholesterol and saturated fats, higher consumption of vegetables, and limited sedentary behaviors [29, 42, 60].",71ece12e-aa3b-43fd-b096-a6c520b0b156
31,discussion7," Thus, our findings further validate the proposed concept that adherence to a ‘prudent’ diet reflects an overall healthier lifestyle profile that can be protective of adverse health outcomes [59, 61], whereas adults who adhere to unhealthy dietary patterns, such as the Western DP, tend to adopt unfavorable lifestyle behaviors including smoking [41], alcohol consumption [62], and sedentary behaviors [15].  An inverse association between adherence to a Western DP and presence of chronic diseases was observed in this study. Such an association could be an artifact of reverse causation given the cross-sectional nature of the study. In fact, diagnosed elderly may have increased health consciousness due to their condition and would consequently refrain from consuming western-like dietary patterns [63, 64].  In this study, no significant association between identified DPs and obesity were observed (data not shown).",bd772cb4-78fe-4e3c-95e7-221c181c88e3
32,discussion8," Although in previous studies associations were reported between the Western pattern and obesity, most of these studies were conducted among younger adults [29, 47, 65]. The evidence among older adults is less conclusive [10, 58]. In fact, the association between diet and obesity among elderly may be complicated by a myriad of complex biological, hormonal, and metabolic changes. These age-related alterations affect body composition, including the accumulation of body fat and reduction in muscle mass. Furthermore, older adults represent a heterogeneous group with wide individual variations in terms of their physical health, disease progression status, psychosocial conditions, and the use of medications; all of which are factors that may further mask the effect of diet on body weight and obesity [36, 66, 67].",977b810c-2bc6-4e2f-906f-177b81a5d87d
33,discussion9,"  Though, in this study, no association was found between dietary intake and obesity, recent evidence highlight the role of a better quality of diet in preserving and improving physical and cognitive resilience of older adults and promoting healthy aging [68]. In addition to other behavioral factors such as physical activity, diets of high quality may slow down the rate of biological aging at the cellular, molecular, and overall system level and may also reduce the impact of stress on the brain and hence delay age-related vascular cognitive impairments including depression and dementia among older adults [69, 70].  Several strengths exist in this study. It is the first study in Lebanon and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to identify and characterize the dietary patterns and diet quality of older adults. Data used in this study was derived from a national representative survey with a high response rate.",ed1a088e-155c-4d58-980e-7114a1168103
34,discussion10," Furthermore, anthropometric and dietary data was collected by trained dietitians resulting in consistent interpretations as well as higher response and completion rates that enhanced the validity of the collected data. However, this study has a number of limitations including possible recall bias and underreporting commonly faced when assessing dietary intake of adults, particularly those who are overweight or obese [71]. In addition, the cross-sectional design of the present study does not allow for inferring causality when exploring associations between identified DPs and various socio-demographic, anthropometric and lifestyle variables. Although the lack of association between the DPs and Body mass index (BMI) could be attributed to age-related physiological changes, the high percentage of overweight and obese participants (approximately 80 %) may have limited the variability of the outcome measure (Body mass index (BMI)), possibly leading to a null association.",e9c8273f-f6c0-494d-b635-945f78b308b4
35,discussion11," Future longitudinal studies are needed to examine changes in DPs over time and to explore diet-disease associations taking into consideration various metabolic biomarkers and body composition indicators. Furthermore, measures of weight change (ex. annual weight change) rather than single and static weight measurements, like Body mass index (BMI), taken at only one point in time may help address the dynamic interplay between diet, obesity, and chronic diseases among older adults [72].  Conclusion In conclusion, three main DPs were identified among a representative sample of Lebanese older adults, namely: a Lebanese pattern, a Western and a High Protein/Alcohol pattern. The identified Lebanese pattern, characterized by high intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds, was found to be not only of better dietary quality but it was also associated with healthier lifestyle behaviors and an overall healthy profile compared to the two other DPs.",988ed29b-4608-48fe-aea7-de05c7d07520
36,discussion12," Findings from this study can be the impetus for developing evidence-based public health strategies to promote the Lebanese pattern as a balanced and nutritious diet of high quality in an attempt to promote longevity andoverall quality of life among older adults.
