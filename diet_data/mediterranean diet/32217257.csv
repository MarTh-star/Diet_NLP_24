0,methods0," The main steps that were taken to adapt the ELRCD-based dietary plan to Italian eating habits and to compare it with an Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG)-based dietary plan are shown in Figure 1 and described in detail below. Overall, the process was divided into four main phases: Definition of the EAT Lancet Commission reference diet (ELCRD) adapted dietary pattern (named EAT-IT).  Development of a mid/long-term dietary plan based on the EAT-IT dietary pattern.  Definition of another dietary plan in line with Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG), which was useful as a basis for comparing nutritional intakes.  Comparison of the EAT-IT-based and Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG)-based dietary plans in terms of serving size, frequencies of consumption, and nutritional adequacy.  2.1.",cbabb4b9-9d00-453d-8a64-47d69e32dd0e
1,methods1," Phase 1: Definition of the EAT-IT-Based Dietary Plan  This first phase consisted of three steps that were devoted to the definition of an EAT Lancet Commission reference diet (ELCRD)-adapted dietary pattern based on Mediterranean food habits. The EAT Lancet Commission reference diet (ELCRD) provides the daily intake for eight different food categories (whole grain, tubers or starchy vegetables, vegetables, fruits, dairy foods, protein sources, added fats, and added sugars), which are expressed as both grams/day and kilocalories/day considering a diet of 2500 kcal/day [11], while no information regarding the frequencies of consumption or other indications related to the meal preparation are provided. For these reasons, with the aim to develop a mid/long-term dietary pattern, the daily intakes were converted to weekly amounts (step 1) that were expressed as grams.",7590181d-fac7-480c-b307-fbc3b9210e4d
2,methods2," Data were used to calculate feasible weekly frequencies of consumption, while the intake expressed as kilocalories was used to develop isocaloric alternatives within the same food category. Once we calculated the portion and the frequency of consumption for the eight categories, foods were allocated into different meals (step 2). This was performed in line with the indications from the Mediterranean food pyramid, which, for instance, includes cereal-based products and fruits and vegetables at every main meal.  The final step (step 3) consisted of the development of a dietary pattern, putting together the meals designed in step 2 but providing alternatives that would allow for following this dietary pattern for the long term. The resulting scheme was named EAT-IT, as it was rearranged based on the Italian/Mediterranean food habits and in line with the indications from the EAT-Lancet Commission.  2.2.",0302f1d9-8e48-4e47-8c89-5c9624994d5c
3,methods3," Phase 2: Simulation of an EAT-IT-Based Dietary Plan  The second phase included three steps that were devoted to the development of a dietary plan, which was based on the dietary pattern planned as described in Section 2.1 and considering 2500 kcal/day as the target energy intake. First, recipes and dishes, based on traditional and generally consumed recipes that are eaten by the Italian population, were constructed based on the EAT-IT scheme and considering an adequate number of alternatives/substitutions with the purpose to cover a mid-to-long period (i.e., several months/a season) (step 4). For instance, for protein sources, several recipes were used to offer an adequate number of alternatives, with the aim to increase the variability of the dietary plan and to simulate a situation in which the consumers can choose different dishes based on their food preferences and ingredient availability.",3a7ce1f7-4aa6-4310-b21f-b56dd92f0654
4,methods4," The number of alternatives proposed was greater for food categories with higher frequencies of consumption in traditional Italian meals.  These recipes were then used to create a database that was elaborated upon using software for nutritional assessment (MètaDieta professional 4.1.1 METEDA Srl–Roma, Italy) to simulate a monthly dietary plan that is consistent with Italian habits (step 5). Specifically, five meals per day were considered (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and mid-morning and mid-afternoon snacks), including a “typical” Italian breakfast [19] made of a cereal-based food, a dairy product, and jam or juice, as well as snacks [20] consisting of nuts.  Once developed, the dietary plan was analyzed for the nutritional characteristics in terms of energy and macro- and micronutrients, and finally provided as daily amounts in kilocalories, grams, milligrams, or micrograms, depending on the nutritional component (step 6).  2.3.",f3931892-74b4-4074-818d-1bf0f14bcb62
5,methods5," Phase 3: Simulation of a Dietary Plan in Line with Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG)  This third phase of the process was aimed at defining a dietary plan that was developed based on the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG), similar to what was performed in Section 2.2. Toward this aim, in step 7, we performed an elaboration of a mid/long-term dietary plan following the same procedure that was used for elaborating the EAT-IT plan.  2.4. Phase 4: Comparison of the Portions, Frequencies of Consumption, and Nutritional Adequacy of the EAT-IT- and Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG)-Based Dietary Plans  The final phase of this process was devoted to the comparison of the newly developed Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG)-based dietary plan with the EAT-IT plan in terms of the serving sizes, frequencies, and nutritional adequacy.",3375bc42-fda5-437f-9e29-13facb24c7a0
6,methods6," Specifically, in step 8, the EAT-IT serving sizes and frequencies of consumption were compared with those proposed in the last edition of the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) and referring to the target energy intake of 2500 kcal. Finally, the nutritional adequacy of the two developed dietary plans was analyzed (step 9). The comparison was made by considering the nutritional adequacy of the two dietary plans, i.e., their ability to reach the target intakes and to cover the reference values for energy and macro- and micronutrients as defined for Italian adults with 2500 kcal as the recommended energy intake (both men and women), using the Levels of Reference Intake of Nutrients and Energy for the Italian Population (LARN) as a reference [21].  In detail, data were compared with reference intakes (RIs, for carbohydrates and lipids). The average requirements (ARs) and the population reference intake (population reference intake (PRI)) were instead used when available (i.e.",a6f0a0a9-8e1b-4990-ba9f-fec3be65db57
7,methods7,", for protein, all vitamins except vitamin E, and all minerals except sodium, chlorine, and potassium). The AR represents the level of nutrient intake sufficient to satisfy the needs of 50% of healthy subjects of a specific group of a population while the population reference intake (PRI) refers to the amount needed to cover 97.5% of the population, thus providing important information for nutritional assessment. For the micronutrients for which AR was not available, adequate intake (AI) was considered (vitamin E, sodium, chlorine, and potassium). When available (i.e., for saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)), cholesterol, sugar, and fiber), the suggested dietary target (suggested dietary target (SDT)) was also taken into account for nutritional evaluation.  3. Results  3.1. Definition of the EAT-IT Dietary Pattern and Simulation of a Consistent Dietary Plan  As described in the Materials and Methods section (see Section 2.",a25aa9eb-b173-4188-9063-5350ebcc1f05
8,methods8,"1), step 1 was devoted to the calculation of the daily or weekly servings for the different foods based on the EAT Lancet Commission reference diet (ELCRD) model. These portions, expressed as grams/week, were then used to calculate feasible weekly frequencies of consumption. For instance, for the subcategory “eggs” (with a daily intake of 13 g/day based on the EAT Lancet Commission reference diet (ELCRD)), 91 g/week were calculated, which corresponded to about two eggs of 50 g per week. In addition, the food portions were expressed in kilocalories/week to develop isocaloric alternatives within the same food category: for instance, 250 mL of whole milk was considered equivalent to 330 mL of semi-skimmed milk.  In step 2, the different foods were allocated in the daily meals (i.e., breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks) according to the Mediterranean food pyramid [17], as summarized in Table 1 and Table 2, in which meal compositions and possible alternatives are reported.",00b74a4a-3d8f-4842-94ef-1b6665cbe226
9,methods9," By using combinations of such meals, the EAT-IT dietary pattern was developed (step 3) to be adherent to the EAT Lancet Commission reference diet (ELCRD) indication but adapted to the Italian dietary habits and recipes, and sufficiently varied to be followed for a relatively long period. In detail, the single meals were organized as follows: (1) breakfast included a source of whole grains (e.g., oat flakes or wholemeal rusks), milk or derivatives, and added sugars (e.g., jam or fruit juice); (2) lunch and dinner were composed of a source of whole grains (e.g., brown rice, corn, or wholemeal pasta) or starchy vegetables (i.e., potatoes), a protein source (e.g., legumes, chicken and poultry, beef, lamb and pork, or fish), vegetables, fats (mainly extra virgin olive oil), and a portion of fruit at the end of each meal; (3) snacks (twice a day) consisting of a portion of nuts.",637f9515-4dde-486e-8027-cae4ac3bc493
10,methods10,"  Once we defined the EAT-IT dietary pattern, a complete dietary plan with recipes and alternatives was developed to simulate a real-life diet with meals and preparations that were chosen to include all foods in the defined servings and frequencies but remaining consistent with the Italian culinary tradition (steps 4 and 5). For example, to facilitate the use of large amounts of legumes, traditional recipes already present in Italian food habits, such as “pasta e fagioli” (i.e., pasta with “borlotti” beans) or “riso e bisi” (rice with peas), were included (data not shown). The newly developed dietary plan was finally evaluated in terms of the nutritional characteristics, as described below (Section 3.3).  3.2. Comparison of the Serving Sizes and Frequencies of Consumption between the Italian Dietary Guidelines and the EAT-IT Dietary Patterns  As described in Section 2.",fb46a73c-44b6-4f93-8be8-322e59cf7dda
11,methods11,"4, the indications provided by the last edition of the Italian Dietary Guidelines [18] in terms of both serving sizes and frequencies of consumption were used to develop a parallel dietary plan (step 7, data not shown). This Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG)-based dietary plan was compared with the EAT-IT dietary plan, as reported in Table 3.  Interestingly, one of the main differences between the two dietary patterns was related to the amount of fruits and vegetables provided, which was lower in the EAT-IT compared to the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) dietary plans (overall 200 g/day vs. 450 g/day for fresh fruits and overall 300 g/day vs. up to 600 g/day of fresh vegetables, respectively). Large differences were also observed for protein sources, with a lower amount of chicken meat in the EAT-IT, compared to the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) (overall 200 g/week vs. 300 g/week), as well as fish (200 g/week vs. 300 g/week), eggs (four medium eggs of 50 g/week vs.",2599623e-bf0b-4f1a-8299-d14774850183
12,methods12," two medium eggs), and milk and derivatives (overall 375 mL/day of milk or yogurt vs. 250 mL/day). The Italian guidelines suggest three portions of cheese/week, while cheese is only included as an alternative for milk in the EAT-IT.  Conversely, compared to the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG), the EAT-IT provided a higher quantity of legumes (eight portions/week vs. three portions of 150 g of fresh legumes or 50 g of dried legumes/week) and nuts (45 g day vs. 2.5 portions of 30 g), while red meat was comparable (100 g/week). The comparison for “cereals and derivatives” was tricky since the indications are different in the two schemes, for example, with the Italian guidelines suggesting 4.5 portions of bread/day (for a total of 225 g/day) and one portion/day of 120 g of pasta, rice, corn, and other cereals, while the EAT-IT potentially allowed for bread up to a maximum of 300 g/day or cereals twice a day (for a maximum daily amount of 190 g).",88ba4701-69af-48bd-8ad5-540fb6078aaa
13,methods13,"  The Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) also includes indications related to the intake of sweet bakery products, which are not specifically included in the EAT-IT dietary pattern. Therefore, a comparison was not easy due to the substantial differences in the nature of the indications provided for this category. Finally, an important difference between the two dietary plans was related to further indications provided by the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) that were not present in the EAT-IT, e.g., suggestions of equivalences for dried fruit and portion and frequencies of consumption for leaf salads, preserved fish, and water.  3.3. Assessment of the Nutritional Adequacy of the EAT-IT- and Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG)-Based Dietary Plans  In this last part of the process, the energies and nutrient intakes of the two developed dietary plans (i.e., the EAT-IT- and Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG)-based dietary plans) were analyzed to assess their nutritional characteristics.",2feee9f5-9420-4397-b566-09deac2096bb
14,methods14," In detail, the energy and macro- and micronutrients provided by the two dietary plans were compared with the Italian recommendations (LARN [21]) developed by the Italian Society of Human Nutrition (Society of Human Nutrition (SINU)) to verify the ability of these dietary patterns to satisfy the nutritional requirements, considering an energy target of 2500 kcal.  Table 4 shows the comparison of the macronutrient composition and distribution of the two dietary patterns. The overall higher amount of lipids provided by the EAT-IT dietary plan (36.2%) compared to the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG)-based dietary plan accounted for 30.3% of the daily energy on average. The difference in the lipids intake appeared to be mainly due to the monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)), which were considerably higher in the EAT-IT-based dietary plan (19.6%) relative to the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) plan (14.9%).",113e130c-1967-4629-99f2-91a4cb424f6a
15,methods15," The high amount of lipids in the EAT-IT plan was accompanied by a relatively low amount of carbohydrates (about 48%), which was slightly above the lower threshold set at 45% of energy by LARN. In the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) dietary plan, carbohydrates provided about 54% of energy (including energy from fiber).  Regarding the total fiber, the amount was higher in the EAT-IT dietary plan relative to the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) and slightly higher than the range reported in the LARN (12.6–16.7 g/1000 kcal). Despite these differences, both dietary plans were verified to cover the requirements for the majority of the nutrients, including some of the most critical ones, such as omega-3 essential fatty acids (0.6% and 0.8% of energy for the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) and EAT-IT, respectively) and protein was comparable between the two dietary patterns (97.6 and 97.7 g, respectively).",69f34465-babb-472c-bf47-b74ffbb3c03e
16,methods16," Energy from omega-6 fatty acids was within the range (RI = 4–8% of energy) for the EAT-IT plan (6.3%) and just slightly below the RI for the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) (3.7%). Notably, both dietary plans provided low amounts of cholesterol (less than the 300 mg/day suggested by the LARN), where the cholesterol level was markedly lower in the EAT-IT-based dietary plan (165.4 mg) compared with the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) plan (248.7 mg).  Considering vitamins (Table 5), no nutritional inadequacy emerged from the analysis of the two dietary plans, except for vitamin D, which was found to be lower than the average requirement indicated by the LARN (10 µg) in both the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) and EAT-IT dietary plans (2.3 and 1.9 µg, respectively).",d0e71acb-bda8-43e5-b7ec-4ef3aeaac516
17,methods17,"  For other vitamins, such as vitamin K (phylloquinone and menaquinone), B5 (pantothenic acid), and B8 (biotin), a thorough evaluation could not be carried out due to the presence of many missing data for these vitamins in the food composition databases used (i.e., the Food Composition Database for Epidemiological Studies in Italy [23] and the Council for Agricultural Research and Economics (Council for Agricultural Research and Economics (CREA)) food composition database [24]).  Regarding the mineral intake, the comparison of the dietary plans revealed wide differences in the calcium levels provided by the two dietary plans. Specifically, the EAT-IT-based dietary plan was less prone to satisfy the average requirement defined by the LARN, providing, on average, 680 mg/day (Table 6). The overall iron was found to be adequate in both the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG)- (17.9 mg) and EAT-IT-based dietary plans (22.",54e4f557-e5b2-4471-8f88-9acd3c142760
18,methods18,"1 mg), even when compared to the population reference intake (PRI) (18 mg for female and 10 mg for male) reported by the LARN, and with the higher amount provided by the EAT-IT (≈22 mg), despite the overall lower amount of meat (considering both white and red meat) when compared to the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG).  All other assessed minerals (magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc) were adequate in both dietary plans. Sodium was found to be lower (about 827 mg) in the EAT-IT dietary plan compared to the AI suggested by the LARN (1500 mg) and close to the suggested dietary target (SDT) (2000 mg) for Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) (≈2017 mg), while chlorine was found to be lower than the AI (2300 mg) in both the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG)- and EAT-IT-based dietary plans (1217 and 531 mg, respectively). Regarding the values of sodium and chlorine, discretionary salt was not included in the evaluation.",4711769b-55dc-4b8b-aae9-1502882e0394
19,methods19," As already reported for vitamins, the adequacy of certain minerals, such as copper, iodine, manganese, and selenium, was not assessed due to missing data in the database.  4. Discussion  In this study, we developed a practical application of the EAT-Lancet Reference Diet into a dietary plan that is consistent with Italian/Mediterranean food habits. Indeed, the sustainability of diets represents a crucial issue for the future [25], as healthy and sustainable diets should be both adequate for satisfying nutritional requirements and respectful of local traditions and cultures [7]. In this context, the last revision of the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) [18], which was developed by the Council for Agricultural Research and Economics (CREA) Food and Nutrition Research Centre, has provided dedicated information on this specific issue (i.e.",17a8267a-8870-433b-8554-ea52138b11a9
20,methods20,", “How to ensure a varied, safe, healthy and sustainable diet”), highlighting how an adequate consumption of the different food groups of the Italian tradition, including limited amounts of animal products, can positively impact both on humans’ and the planet’s health.  The planetary diet is based on whole grains, legumes, nuts, fruit, and vegetables and includes a limited amount of dairy, meat, and other animal sources of protein and fats. The current literature is certainly not complete, but diets including reduced amounts of meat and dairy are indicated by many studies as both having a lower impact on the environment and being nutritionally adequate [9,26].",c060b87e-39bb-42c2-a4d4-0a9ec65be4e6
21,methods21,"  Collins and Fairchild [10] calculated that, based on the food consumption of the Cardiff population, the lowest environmental impact was obtained with a partial substitution of food with a high ecological footprint, while a typical vegetarian diet was associated with a lower reduction in the ecological footprint and lower nutritional adequacy. Seves et al. [9] performed similar calculations based on the food consumption of the Dutch population, reporting that a vegan diet (all meat and dairy replaced with plant-based foods) was associated with the highest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and land use but was nutritionally inadequate, while a 30% replacement, despite having a less marked reduction on the environmental impact, resulted in the best performance in terms of nutritional adequacy.",134bf55e-dc8e-4e22-b8b3-e500bb197b87
22,methods22," These considerations underline the importance of better evaluating the pros and cons of modifications in the traditional diet and the need for a better understanding of the possible nutritional and functional impacts of revised, sustainable dietary patterns.  The adaptability and scalability of the EAT Lancet Commission reference diet (ELCRD) have been investigated from different points of view in studies performed in different countries, including the USA [16], India [15], and Denmark [14]. Considering the Italian scenario, Ferrari et al. [27] calculated the daily portion of foods that could minimize gas emissions in an optimized Italian diet, while maintaining, as much as possible, an adequate nutritional intake. Conversely, no studies were found that previously developed a Mediterranean-Italian dietary pattern based on the EAT-Lancet reference diet.",97211fcf-efbd-4409-989f-3948f313a159
23,methods23,"  We performed a nutritional adequacy assessment on two examples of dietary plans (one from the EAT-IT dietary pattern and one based on the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG)), which highlighted some potential issues related to the frequency of consumption of some foods/food classes and/or the intake of specific nutrients. For instance, the differences in the levels of energy from carbohydrates reflected slight differences in the serving sizes of cereals, particularly during breakfast. Indeed, the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) includes specific recommendations regarding the consumption of biscuits, pastries, or other cereal-based products at breakfast, making this meal rich in carbohydrates sources, while the EAT-IT pattern includes a lower amount of wholemeal cereals.",43ba28dd-3a3a-4584-aa2c-9dadfbbed815
24,methods24,"  Conversely, the high amount of energy from lipids and the high amount of fiber in the EAT-IT dietary plan likely reflected the large intake of plant oil, nuts, and legumes, which represented the main differences between the two dietary patterns analyzed. Legumes and nuts are used in EAT-IT as an alternative for other protein sources, as reflected by the lower amount of total meat, fish, eggs, and dairy in the EAT-IT compared to the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG).  Regarding the nutritional adequacy of the two developed dietary plans, there was a higher fat intake promoted through the EAT-IT diet compared to the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) one, where this was slightly higher than the LARN reference intake (i.e., 20–35% En). Despite being quite high, this value does not exceed the suggested dietary target (SDT) for saturated fatty acids (SFA) and mainly consisted of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) because extra virgin olive was the primary source of fat in both dietary plans.",c23fe79a-f173-49ba-abf3-9e36fbdfc0ba
25,methods25," An extensive review of randomized controlled trials demonstrated that dietary monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (20–25% of the total energy) prevented or ameliorated cardiovascular disease by modulating several biological parameters, such as the lipids profile, blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity [28]. The EAT-IT-based dietary plan also resulted in higher PUFA compared to the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) dietary plan due to the higher amount of nuts.  Other differences were observed for micronutrients. The level of calcium intake apparently provided by the EAT-IT dietary plan (about 675 mg) was low relative to the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) plan (>1 g) and compared to the average requirements for adults (i.e., 800 mg/day).",9b5367a0-4c0c-4c0d-a856-d0bf350e8b78
26,methods26," The intake of calcium represents a critical issue, considering that the mean daily intake from food in adults, according to the last available Italian National Food Consumption Survey in Belgium (FWO) France (INRA)N-SCAI 2005-06 [29], is already lower than recommended (i.e., the average intake estimated: 756 mg for males and 697 mg for females).  The amount of calcium in the EAT-IT dietary plan was in line with estimates provided by the EAT-Lancet Commission, who indicated a theoretical value of 718 mg of calcium from the Reference Diet [11]. The differences between the two dietary plans were likely due to the higher amount of milk and cheese included in the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) compared to the EAT-IT dietary plan. This issue was also highlighted by Lassen et al. [14], who adapted the EAT Lancet Commission reference diet (ELCRD) to reach the indications of their Nordic Nutrition Recommendations [30] of 1 g by increasing the portion of dairy foods and cheese.",d01f7555-97fa-4208-af47-5d53937ddd59
27,methods27,"  However, the calculations performed did not consider the calcium content in water, which could significantly contribute to the intake, reducing the risk of inadequacy with respect to the calcium requirements [31]. The calcium content in tap water may largely vary; thus, it is difficult to evaluate the contribution of water to the total calcium intake [32]. Considering an average value of 60 mg/L for Italian tap waters [33], 2 L provides about 120 mg of highly bioavailable calcium, which still seems to be insufficient to reach the population reference intake (PRI) value. Thus, an adequate availability and choice of calcium-rich sources (including mineral waters and/or fortified food products) could be pivotal to avoid the long-term effects of deficiencies of at-risk nutrients, such as calcium, particularly in vulnerable subjects (e.g., women or, in general, subjects with restrictive or less varied eating habits).",ff0107ab-8200-4865-bf6a-f5d048a5f467
28,methods28," Moreover, specific guidelines would be fundamental to allow for reaching dietary recommendations depending on the type of source considered.  Regarding vitamin D, both menus were very low (≈2 µg) as sources of this important micronutrient, which has impacts on numerous body functions. These values are in line with the levels of intake according to in Belgium (FWO) France (INRA)N-SCAI 2005-06 [29], which indicated a median intake of 1.9 µg for males and 1.5 µg for females in Italy. In addition, the major source for vitamin D is the endogenous synthesis that takes place in the skin, while food sources of vitamin D, such as fatty fish, mushrooms, and eggs, typically play only a minor role in the total contribution [34,35]. However, considering specific members of the population have little or no exposure to sunlight or have a diminished synthesis capacity (e.g.",25eae935-c97b-4917-8509-02149135a7c1
29,methods29,", older subjects) [36], the resulting intake of vitamin D represents a problem for which different strategies could be useful, such as the use of well-designed and targeted fortified foods or novel foods [37].  Intriguingly, iron was slightly higher in the EAT-IT dietary plan when compared with the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) one. This could be explained by considering that, while the amount of red meat was comparable between the two dietary plans, the intake of legumes and nuts was higher in the EAT-IT compared to the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG). However, iron bioavailability largely depends on the food source and the type of iron. The heme iron present in meat generally shows the highest bioavailability, and, conversely, different types of iron (nonheme) and the co-presence of phytate in plant-based food diets could reduce the bioavailability [38,39]. Conversely, the presence of reducing agents (i.e., vitamin C) should increase the bioavailability [40].",5b8f0b5c-462f-46bf-896c-bf0882377ae0
30,methods30,"  Another apparent difference between the nutritional profile of these two dietary plans is related to sodium and chlorine, which were higher in the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) dietary plan when compared with the EAT-IT plan. However, in both dietary plans, added salt was not included. The higher amount of sodium and chlorine in the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) dietary plan could be explained by considering the higher amount of foods containing salt (e.g., bread and cheese) that was suggested by the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) compared to the EAT-IT. The level of sodium in the Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) dietary plan was slightly above the suggested dietary target (SDT) (without considering added salt) and highlights the importance of policies for reducing the amount of salt contained in foods, which represent the main source of salt (up to 70–75% of the total intake) in Europe [41].",10b20621-1ba4-43da-a219-b9a9e2c372d3
31,methods31," Indeed, the actual intake for the Italian population is acknowledged to be largely higher than recommended by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) (<5 g day), with an average estimated salt intake of almost 11 g for men and 8.5 for women [42,43].  Overall, the comparison between the micronutrients provided by the two dietary plans and dietary recommendations often highlighted that the amount could not always cover the needs of the overall population (i.e., the population reference intake (PRI) referring to 97.5% of the population). These findings suggest a potential future need for strategies to improve the nutritional characteristics of foods and diets to enable coverage of the nutrient needs of specific target groups.",8ef24f06-87d3-4869-8716-5696c8ae2116
32,methods32," The strategies may include the formulation of new products that are enriched with specific compounds, for instance, by the selection of new cultivars of vegetable products with increased nutritional benefits or the exploitation of novel foods to define new dietary models that are optimized to cover eventual inadequacies.  While the simulation of possible dietary patterns with potential benefits in terms of sustainability and human health is a challenging approach with both pros and cons, the present study showed some strengths. For example, the dietary plans were developed by considering the Italian dietary habits, tradition, and culture, as well as in terms of meal composition and distribution throughout the day, with the aim to increase the final acceptability of a future dietary plan. The newly developed dietary pattern was developed to consider several alternatives such that the diet can potentially be used in the medium-to-long term (e.g.",8eb445a5-9f61-45d9-9f3c-37bb9c8111cd
33,methods33,", months) due to the feasibility of the dietary pattern.  Regarding limitations, the first was the impossibility of performing an extensive and accurate comparison with dietary recommendations due to missing/unavailable data for certain micronutrients in the food databases, as previously reported. In particular, the micronutrients for which it was not possible to assess nutritional intake included vitamin B5, B8, and K, as well as copper, iodine, manganese, and selenium, which were also not considered in the previously cited Italian National Food Consumption Survey in Belgium (FWO) France (INRA)N-SCAI 2005-06 [29]. Even considering other databases, such as the USDA, some micronutrients (i.e., vitamin B8 and iodine) are still not complete. This issue indicates the importance of developing more complete food composition databases to better evaluate the ability of dietary plans to cover nutritional requirements [44].",a5086e4a-a2bb-4675-92d0-89d9429d5c54
34,methods34,"  Therefore, future efforts should be focused in this direction to allow for more accurate nutritional assessments, especially considering diets that can be critical for certain nutrients in the overall population or specific target groups [44,45]. Despite this, deficiencies are unlikely for almost all of the abovementioned micronutrients that have incomplete data in the databases, except for iodine, for which almost 45% of the European population showed insufficient intake [21]. These data support the importance of policies that have been established to increase the consumption of iodine-enriched salt and its utilization as an ingredient in food [40]. Second, in the present study, we considered several isoenergetic food alternatives that mimic practical dietary plans that include generally different possible consumer food/meal choices (e.g., whole milk and semi-skimmed milk as alternatives for breakfast) that may differ in nutritional composition.",e6fd2878-842e-4071-803b-e62003816045
35,methods35," In these cases, we considered the average composition, but it is clear that differences between foods may also impact the final nutrient intake. This further underlines the importance of making dietary choices that are not only focused on energy content but also defining targeted alternatives that are able to cover potential inadequacies. Last, a thorough evaluation of the effect of processing and cooking on the nutrient content was not performed in a systematic way, despite these factors being able to affect the nutritional compositions of dishes.  The recommended portion sizes and frequencies of consumption for the different food groups as proposed in the EAT-IT are quite far from the current dietary behavior of the Italian population.",0a9e8d26-5ad9-4635-829d-6c28057eeda1
36,methods36," In detail, one of the main differences regards the amount of legumes and nuts that are consumed in a lower amount in the Italian population compared to EAT-IT, while meat, eggs, dairy products, animal fat, and tropical oils are consumed in higher amounts [46].  These wide differences could make it difficult to adhere to the EAT-IT dietary pattern developed; thus, further efforts should be done to enable better compliance and acceptability of the model. Among these efforts, the development of specific food-based dietary guidelines and policies might help consumers with understanding how to tailor their dietary habits in order to achieve a more sustainable dietary pattern that is, at the same time, respectful of local culture and tradition. In this regard, it is worth noting that a new version of the Mediterranean pyramid has recently been proposed, which recommends consuming legumes and nuts every day [47].",fdee962c-e4f4-42fb-97ee-5e9a95724317
37,methods37," The possibility of improving the adoption of eating habits in consumers in line with these guidelines could also be facilitated by implementing attractive recipes and new products that are able to include such foods, and to target different consumer groups, such as the younger consumers who are very often those that are less adherent to the Mediterranean and healthy dietary patterns. In this scenario, the availability of fortified products or alternative sources may become a good option above all in those consumers who are less prone to adapting to new dietary patterns and foods or more strict guidelines.  5. Conclusions  Overall, the newly developed dietary pattern represents a possible practical elaboration of the data indicated by Willet et al. [11], but it should not be considered as strict or prescriptive. The defined dietary pattern is intended for adult subjects having a 2500 kcal daily energy need, but adjustments for other energy targets or population groups (e.g.",f6714434-5e0a-4450-9257-d3b5ca909b66
38,methods38,", older adults) should be made. Therefore, further efforts are needed to define the concrete feasibility of such patterns in relation to the food habits of the population, considering that making changes that are too large from their usual diet can preclude many people from adopting such diets [10]. Finally, there is a clear need for the validation of these newly developed dietary patterns within the context of proper real-life studies to better elucidate their feasibility, affordability, and their beneficial health effects.
