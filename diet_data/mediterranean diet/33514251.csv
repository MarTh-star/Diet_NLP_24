1,background0, The effect of diet on age-related brain atrophy is largely unproven.  Objectives  We aimed to explore the effect of a Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean diet (MED)) higher in polyphenols and lower in red/processed meat (Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet) on age-related brain atrophy. ,fa636a90-c439-4725-bf5b-a2f302e30f36
2,methods0," Research design  DIRECT-PLUS (NCT03020186) was launched in May 2017 and conducted in a workplace which is in a remote area in Israel (Nuclear Research Center Negev, Dimona, Israel). Workers do not leave the workplace during the workday, and a monitored lunch is provided. Most clinical and medical measurements (anthropometric measurements, blood drawing) and lifestyle-intervention sessions were performed at the workplace's medical department. Among 378 volunteers, 294 met age (≥30 y of age) and abdominal obesity inclusion criteria [waist circumference (WC): men >102 cm, women >88 cm] or had dyslipidemia [triglycerides (TGs) >150 mg/dL; HDL cholesterol ≤40 mg/dL for men, ≤50 mg/dL for women].",9a43dbcb-bdf5-47c4-8751-4a8cd30f883b
3,methods1, Exclusion criteria were inability to perform PA; serum creatinine ≥2 mg/dL; serum alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase >3 times above the upper normal limit; major illness that might require hospitalization; pregnancy or lactation; active cancer or chemotherapy treatment in the last 3 y; warfarin treatment; pacemaker or platinum implantation; or participation in a different trial.  The Soroka Medical Center Medical Ethics Board and Institutional Review Board provided ethics approval. All participants provided written consent and received no financial compensation.,3310b974-e51f-4905-9c1e-2f607b52cc42
4,methods2,"  Randomization and intervention  All participants completed the baseline measurements and were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio via a computer-based program, stratified by sex and work status (to ensure equal workplace-related lifestyle features between groups), into 1 of the 3 intervention groups: healthy dietary guidelines (HDG) as an active control group, Mediterranean diet (MED), or Green-Mediterranean diet (MED). The 18-mo-long interventions were contemporaneous, and participants were not blinded to group assignment (open-label protocol). All lifestyle interventions were held in person, by intervention groups, and included 90-min nutritional and PA sessions. These sessions were performed by a multidisciplinary guidance team (physicians, clinical dietitians, and fitness instructors). Sessions were weekly during the first month, once a month during the subsequent 6 mo, and every other month thereafter.",319252f2-275e-4d2f-b734-cfc8f810beb1
5,methods3," In addition, a website listing all nutritional and PA information needed by the participants to continue with the intervention was accessible to the participants according to their intervention group.  Furthermore, all participants received free gym membership. Further instructions, according to the intervention group, were as follows.  healthy dietary guidelines (HDG) group: in addition to PA, participants received standard nutritional counseling to promote a healthy diet and achieve a similar intervention intensity.  Mediterranean diet (MED) group: in addition to PA, participants were instructed to follow a calorie-restricted, traditional Mediterranean diet (MED) low in simple carbohydrates, as described in our previous CENTRAL (17) trial. The Mediterranean diet (MED) was rich in vegetables, with poultry and fish partly replacing beef and lamb.",d2c1859e-4797-45fb-975e-5deb919459ce
6,methods4," The diet included 28 g walnuts/d containing 440 mg polyphenols/d [gallic acid equivalents (GAE)], including mainly ellagitannins, ellagic acid, and its derivatives (18).  Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) group: in addition to PA, the Mediterranean diet (MED) group instructions, and walnuts, the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet participants were instructed to avoid processed and red meat and consume more plant-based food. Participants were also instructed to drink 3–4 cups/d of green tea and 100 g of Wolffia globosa (Mankai) frozen plant cubes as a green shake dinner substitute. Mankai, a specific strain of Wolffia globosa, is an aquatic plant, considered a natural food source or “vegetable meatball” in Asian cuisines (19). Nutritionally, Mankai is rich in polyphenolic compounds (20) and protein and provides bioavailable essential amino acids (21), iron (22), and vitamin B-12.",73a93a9f-50bb-47a8-9114-a5fd7b89530a
7,methods5," Together, they provided an additional daily intake of 800 mg polyphenols (GAE) beyond the polyphenol content in the prescribed Mediterranean diet (MED) (18). The Mediterranean diet (MED) and Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diets were similarly calorie-restricted (1500–1800 kcal/d for men and 1200–1400 kcal/d for women). The Mediterranean diet (MED) diet components of the 2 intervention groups were identical. A detailed description of the intervention outline and polyphenols provided is available in Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Methods 1, respectively. The walnuts, green tea, and Mankai were provided free of charge and distributed at the on-site clinic.  Assessment of nutritional intake and lifestyle habits was self-reported online using validated FFQs (23, 24), including green tea, walnuts, and Wolffia globosa intake evaluation. Adherence to the PA program was quantified using an electronic self-reported validated PA questionnaire (25).",eb90d4fb-586d-4510-9044-b43ba312277f
8,methods6," PA intensity levels were subsequently measured using metabolic equivalent for task (metabolic equivalent for task (MET)) units per week; each unit is defined as the ratio of work metabolic rate to the standard resting metabolic rate, and metabolic equivalent for task (MET) levels can range from 0.9 metabolic equivalent for task (MET)s (sleeping) to 18 metabolic equivalent for task (MET)s (fast running) (26). The questionnaires were administered at baseline, after 6 mo, and at the end of the trial. The closed workplace enabled monitoring the freely provided lunch and the intense dietary and PA sessions, which were provided at the same time and intensity to all 3 groups. Executive functions were measured using the Brief Executive Function (Brief Executive Function (BEF)) battery (27) at baseline and after 18 mo of intervention.",d0250d7f-5f61-4480-b790-a0a23057ac88
9,methods7," Participants performed the Brief Executive Function (BEF) battery individually in an isolated, quiet room with a research assistant present only during the practice phase. The Brief Executive Function (BEF) is composed of 2 measurements. 1) Working memory/decision load was evaluated by comparing performance in choice reaction-time (choice reaction time (CRT)) tasks (involving letters, digits, shapes) of 6 choices (6choice reaction time (CRT)) and 2 choices (2choice reaction time (CRT)). Specifically, we computed the Balanced Integration Score (Balanced Integration Score (BIS)) (28) for both the 6choice reaction time (CRT) and 2choice reaction time (CRT), and then predicted 6choice reaction time (CRT) from 2choice reaction time (CRT) using simple linear regression; the score was the residual from this regression. 2) Switching was evaluated by comparing a task-switching condition (Switch), involving trial-to-trial shifts in the 2choice reaction time (CRT) tasks (e.g.",01127330-769a-4a51-aa8d-857fb12be195

The final score was the residual from the regression in which Switch-Balanced Integration Score (BIS) was predicted by 2choice reaction time (CRT)-Balanced Integration Score (BIS). Inhibition was assessed with the accuracy in the antisaccade task. Finally, mental speed was assessed by mean response time in the 2choice reaction time (CRT).  Supplemental Methods 2 details further assessment tool descriptions including brain MRI, a detailed Brief Executive Function (BEF) description (including Supplemental Figures 1–3), and methodology analysis.

11,analysis0," Supplemental Methods 3 details the sample size calculations. The DIRECT PLUS primary outcomes were 18-mo changes in visceral abdominal tissue, intrahepatic fat, and adiposity. The results for the primary outcomes are presented in a separate report (29). Longitudinal data from DIRECT PLUS allowed us to examine the effects of the dietary interventions on brain volume and structures. Figure 1 presents the complete flowchart of the Brain DIRECT-PLUS trial. Our a priori primary assessment was differences in changes in brain volumes: hippocampal occupancy score (hippocampal occupancy score (HOC)), calculated as hippocampal volume/[hippocampal volume + inferior lateral ventricle volume (lateral ventricle volume (LVV))] for each hemisphere, and then averaged between them (1), and the lateral ventricle volume (LVV).",4258a219-71dd-4d86-98e3-25afdfde1dd9
12,analysis1," Our secondary endpoints were changes in white-matter tract integrity [diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA)] and changes in executive function (EF; as a substudy). We also examined the degree to which changes in volume of brain structures were associated with clinical parameters, blood biomarkers, urine polyphenols, intake of specific food items, and changes in DTI and EF.

13,analysis2," Changes over time across 18 mo of intervention in anthropometric measurements, blood biomarkers, and MRI parameters within groups were measured using Wilcoxon tests or paired-sample t tests. Between-group differences were tested using independent-sample t tests, ANOVA, Mann–Whitney U tests, Kruskal–Wallis tests, or chi-square tests, depending on the number of groups and distribution of the dependent variables. Kendall τ correlation was used to examine the P-trend. Longitudinal changes in brain volumes are presented as the percentage of change relative to baseline. Changes in FA and EF over time are presented as absolute differences. Spline regression was performed to explore the optimal threshold for change in hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) across age after exploring each 5-y age interval. For urine polyphenol untargeted analysis, values of 0 were imputed to the lowest value in our sample.",31759fc6-3d5d-499c-b303-b4aa07446798
14,analysis3," We performed log2 transformation to calculate the changes from baseline and assess the correlations between hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) and phenolic compounds. Changes in brain structures and associations with urinary phenolic compounds were corrected using the false discovery rate (0.05) method for multiple comparisons. Pearson or Spearman correlation was used to analyze associations of anthropometric measurement and blood biomarker changes with changes in brain volume structures. hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) and lateral ventricle volume (LVV) observations of >2.5 SDs from the overall mean were deemed outliers and excluded from the analyses (5 hippocampal occupancy score (HOC), 3 lateral ventricle volume (LVV)).",7c285147-0d74-4f0c-ad67-a557c120fa20
15,analysis4," General linear models were computed to analyze the effects of the Mediterranean diet (MED) and Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diets compared with healthy dietary guidelines (HDG) on hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) and lateral ventricle volume (LVV) changes, and all the comparisons were further adjusted for potential confounders: age, sex, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), the parameter most strongly associated with brain atrophy attenuation. Multiple comparisons were addressed using Bonferroni correction. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp.).

At the baseline phase, lower hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) (r = −0.77) and higher lateral ventricle volume (LVV) (r = 0.54) were strongly correlated with age in a nonlinear fashion (P < 0.001) (Figure 2).",8b5a1144-d34d-4bc8-a083-9a454f881e76
18,results5," After carefully exploring each 5-y age interval, age 50 y emerged as the most prominent threshold for changes in the slopes of hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) decline and lateral ventricle volume (LVV) expansion (t = −9.86, P < 0.001). At baseline, aging was negatively correlated in a more linear pattern with FA in 5 out of the 6 investigated white-matter tracts: cingulum (r = −0.51), hippocampal cingulum (r = −0.32), uncinate fasciculus (r = −0.46), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (r = −0.17), and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF; r = −0.15) (P < 0.05 for all). Fornix FA was not associated with age (r = 0.06, P = 0.3). In the EF substudy among 200 participants at baseline, age was further significantly correlated with reduced EF parameters: mental speed (r = 0.56), inhibition (r = 0.46), working memory (r = −0.23), and task switching (r = 0.2) (P < 0.05 for all).

Adherence to the lifestyle intervention and attrition rate  Among 284 participants with a brain scan at baseline, 224 (79%) completed the intervention and provided 2 valid brain scans. Dropout reasons were confined to a lack of motivation and medical reasons unrelated to the study. The attrition rate did not differ between intervention groups (healthy dietary guidelines (HDG) = 16%, Mediterranean diet (MED) = 25%, and Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) = 23%, P = 0.24 between groups).

33,results21," Among the urine polyphenol biomarkers, elevated concentrations of urine urolithin A (median: 5.5; IQR: 4.8–6; r = 0.17, P = 0.012) and tyrosol (median: 5.7; IQR: 5.5–5.8; r = 0.14, P = 0.036) were significantly associated with a lower decline in hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) in the entire sample and in subjects ≥ 50 y of age (median: 5.6; IQR: 4.9–6.1; r = 0.24, P = 0.013, and median: 5.7; IQR: 5.6–5.8; r = 0.26, P = 0.007 for urolithin A and tyrosol, respectively).  FIGURE 5 Relative change in hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) according to specific “green” dietary components (age ≥ 50 y).

34,results22," All analyses were performed for data from older participants of the study population (age ≥ 50 y). Mankai and green tea consumption were measured and analyzed only for the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet (Mediterranean diet higher in polyphenols and lower in red/processed meat) group. All analyses were nonparametric. hippocampal occupancy score (HOC), hippocampal occupancy score. ",73517cb7-d573-40d8-b5f1-0857c4026407
35,discussion0," This 18-mo MRI PA + dietary clinical trial among 284 participants with abdominal obesity suggests that the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED), high-polyphenol diet is potentially neuroprotective against age-related neurodegeneration. Overall, we observed a significant increase in hippocampal atrophy, which was accelerated in participants over age 50 y compared with younger participants. Consumption of specific “green” dietary components such as Mankai, green tea (marginally), and walnuts and reduced consumption of red meat were specifically associated with reduced hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) decline, as were increases in specific urine Mankai-derived polyphenols (i.e., urolithin A and tyrosol). Moreover, improvements in cardiometabolic parameters such as glycemic markers, body weight, and BP were associated with less hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) decline and lateral ventricle volume (LVV) expansion.",33d65d75-b16c-4af1-88e9-cc396a96b800
36,discussion1," Our findings underscore the beneficial role of a healthy lifestyle that includes consumption of dietary polyphenols, particularly on brain health in early aging.  The hippocampus is an essential subcortical region for learning and memory (30). Accumulated evidence suggests that hippocampal atrophy is a key part of the mechanism contributing to the development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) is a measure of hippocampal atrophy and has been suggested to be more sensitive and predictive than standard volumetric hippocampal measurement for cognitive decline (1). In our trial, the baseline correlation with age was stronger with hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) than with standard hippocampal volume, and there were significant baseline correlations of hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) with FA values and EF parameters.  We also found a robust nonlinear correlation between age and brain volumes at baseline (e.g.",a8950412-5969-48aa-a877-7fdd5631fe71
37,discussion2,", hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) and lateral ventricle volume (LVV)) and a significant slope change at age 50 y, as well as a significant age-by-intervention group interaction after 18 mo. Our findings are in line with previous studies showing that the trajectories of hippocampal volume and lateral ventricle volume (LVV) vary nonlinearly by age (31, 32) and that hippocampal atrophy accelerates around age 55 y (33). Our findings also corroborate previous evidence that white-matter integrity tends to deteriorate with age and that processing (or mental) speed, a core component of cognitive abilities, is one of the earliest cognitive abilities to decline (34).  Although APOE‐ε4 genotype is a well-known genetic risk factor for AD, we did not find an association of APOE‐ε4 status with brain volumes at baseline or with trajectories of brain volumes after 18 mo of lifestyle intervention.",361b0d7f-86c9-41cd-8460-996d48c9e196
38,discussion3," This might be explained by the low prevalence of the APOE‐ε4 genotype in our study population and the uncertain effect of the APOE‐ε4 genotype on brain atrophy in healthy participants (35).  Our study provides support for the beneficial effects of lifestyle interventions on brain health in older adults. We showed that improved glycemic control, weight loss, and decreased BP were correlated with attenuation of brain atrophy. Sedentary lifestyle, obesity, high BP, and lower glycemic control have been established as substantial risk factors for brain atrophy and cognitive decline (4, 36), and higher cardiovascular disease risk scores at baseline may predict faster rates of cognitive decline and brain atrophy (36). Along these lines, a previous interventional study demonstrated that 1 y of aerobic exercise selectively increased hippocampal volume by 2% (37).",bf4476b7-7ea1-4408-aea1-cdf82ad35e0f
39,discussion4," Moreover, an intensive lifestyle intervention to induce weight loss was associated with lower lateral ventricle volume (LVV) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (14). In addition, regional brain atrophy can manifest years before an age-related neurodegenerative disease is diagnosed (1), highlighting the importance of intensive lifestyle interventions in early adulthood to control modifiable risk factors.  Our main finding shows that the Mediterranean diet (MED) and Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diets had more potent effects on hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) and lateral ventricle volume (LVV) atrophy among older adults than the control condition of healthy dietary guidelines (HDG). These results are in concordance with prior evidence, demonstrating that lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MED) was associated with age-related brain atrophy in the elderly after 3 y regardless of age, sex, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors (38).",7ccbb133-3d5f-4d4d-9948-b1541c22172e
40,discussion5," Moreover, less meat consumption was associated with lower brain atrophy rates. This finding is in accordance with a cross-sectional study (5) that found an inverse association between brain volumes and meat consumption.  A previous large interventional study of 334 older participants demonstrated a beneficial effect of a Mediterranean diet (MED) (augmented by polyphenols in the form of olive oil or walnuts) on cognitive function (specifically in memory and learning) over 4 y of intervention (12). However, other studies failed to show an improvement in cognitive function and/or beneficial effects on brain anatomy after a Mediterranean diet (MED) intervention. Similarly, in our trial and in contrast to the volumetric findings, we could not detect between-group differences, which was perhaps due to a relatively short intervention time, small sample size on the EF substudy, and lack of sensitivity of the methods used to assess cognitive decline (7).",7c71a2af-3361-4436-b0ed-65bd9d5625d7
41,discussion6," Furthermore, we did not find an intervention effect on white-matter integrity. The evidence that dietary pattern affects white-matter connectivity is relatively weak, but it has been suggested that Mediterranean diet (MED) adherence is associated with higher FA values. White-matter integrity might mediate the relation between dietary pattern and cognitive function (39, 40). This discrepancy might be partially accounted for by the different nature of our trial (as a longitudinal intervention (and the robust harmful effect of aging on white-matter integrity (41).  In our trial, both Mediterranean diet (MED) groups received 28 g walnuts/d, which may protect against age-related cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and AD by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress (42).",da4a3bd6-9bd3-4210-8fb5-4f96a7894beb
42,discussion7," Although we found a significant association between increased walnut consumption and attenuation of brain atrophy (as measured by hippocampal occupancy score (HOC)), we failed to demonstrate a significant direct effect of 18 mo of dietary intervention on cognition. This finding is in concordance with a previous long-term intervention trial (43) that did not show a significant effect on cognition after 2 y of walnut supplementation. This might be explained by factors related to the experimental design, namely, insufficient intervention duration, the small sample size in the EF substudy, and the relatively young and healthy study population.  Participants in the Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) group were instructed to consume 3–4 cups/d of green tea containing polyphenols (mostly EGCG), which has been associated with improved cognitive function, reduced neuroinflammation, amyloid β aggregation, microglial activation, and neurodegenerative diseases, both in vivo and in vitro (15).",612347ac-d45b-4a75-ad19-76188dbddf55
43,discussion8," Participants also consumed a Mankai green shake daily, which contained flavonoids (e.g., kaempferol quercetin, catechin) reported to enhance cognition and memory and delay the appearance of neurodegeneration markers (15) and to be inversely related to the incidence of dementia and cognitive decline (44). In the present study, increased consumption of Mankai green shake and green tea (marginally) were associated with attenuated hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) decline. This finding might be partly explained by the beneficial effect of Mankai on the glycemic response, which was an essential mediator of attenuating brain atrophy in our previous trial (45). Notably, previous interventional studies that examined the effect of polyphenols on MRI-measured brain atrophy did not always reveal a beneficial effect on brain volume (13).",8c7e8492-f714-4181-85f8-207330226107
44,discussion9," The effect found in our study might be accounted for by the long and intensive intervention, a larger sample size, and augmentation of the dietary intervention with PA, which has been shown to improve brain volume (37).  Polyphenols from plant-based foods are potent antioxidants that can cross the BBB (9) and ameliorate neuroinflammation by inhibiting proinflammatory markers such as IFN-γ, IL-6, NF-κB, and TNF-α (10, 46). Polyphenols can also increase cerebral blood flow, induce hippocampal neurogenesis and plasticity (11, 47), improve white-matter integrity and spatial learning, and increase locomotor activity in mice (48) and humans (47). Among the urine polyphenols, urolithin A and tyrosol elevations were associated with favorable brain anatomic changes. Urolithin A is a gut metabolite of ellagic acid (49), which is found in Mankai and walnuts, and a higher level of consumption was correlated with increased urolithin A concentrations.",c35e0c25-3c0d-4638-9af8-5f2c4b126b15
45,discussion10," Urolithin A can cross the BBB, inhibit neuroinflammation, promote neurogenesis, and specifically protect the hippocampus from oxidative stress (50). Tyrosol, which is found predominantly in olive oil, was also shown to protect the hippocampus from neuroinflammation, stimulate neurogenesis, and improve spatial memory (51).  Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, there was no passive or placebo control group as a reference, and all groups received PA accommodation, including free gym memberships, which might have had an additive effect on brain atrophy attenuation. This might have led to underestimating the effect of the dietary interventions. However, we decided not to include a passive control group in our trial design for ethical and motivational reasons.",db54ed4d-a6f5-4d44-b407-f30884600e76
46,discussion11," In addition, because this was not a drug, food supplement, or food extract trial but a dietary pattern trial with specific high-polyphenol foods provided as a case study, we cannot claim an effect of specific foods or nutrients. Urine polyphenol measurements are limited in reflecting polyphenol intake and vary widely in their specificity and sensitivity across different polyphenol compounds (52). However, our study did show a correlation between increments in specific polyphenol secretion, which are proposed to reduce neuroinflammation (49), and brain atrophy. Most of our participants were men, reflecting the workplace population. This limits our ability to generalize our results to women, although age-related brain atrophy is more pronounced in males and starts earlier (53).  Moreover, data regarding educational status, baseline cognitive impairment, and depression were not available, so we could not stratify or exclude these conditions in our analysis.",523b2fff-da01-4732-853f-fdf0de02395f
47,discussion12," Finally, our study focused on brain anatomy and included cognitive functions only as a substudy. However, medial temporal atrophy (i.e., lower hippocampal occupancy score (HOC)) was associated with decreased white-matter integrity and lower EF capabilities at baseline in prior research (1). The strengths of this study include a relatively large sample size for the primary outcome of this trial; long duration; integrated data of brain volumetric analyses, white-matter integrity, and EF capabilities; and high adherence. In addition, the median age of the study participants was 50 y, an optimal age for lifestyle intervention because hippocampal atrophy accelerates at this age (54) and begins years before apparent clinical manifestations of cognitive decline (2).",c0e5c4a6-7c2d-481d-90d0-54ad027049cb
48,discussion13," Furthermore, brain volume measured by MRI at baseline and postintervention and quantifying brain volume by a validated automated tool might improve the sensitivity of the analysis in detecting brain volume loss compared to the traditional manual radiologist approach (55). Another strength is the closed workplace environment from which participants were recruited, which enabled monitoring of the provided lunch, the presence of an on-site clinic at the participants’ workplace, intense dietary guidance, group meetings with multidisciplinary guidance, and access to polyphenol-rich food sources provided free of charge.  In conclusion, a calorie-restricted Green-Mediterranean diet (MED) diet enriched with specific polyphenols and decreased red and processed meat consumption may amplify the beneficial effects of a traditional calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet (MED) on age-related brain atrophy in participants mainly >50 y of age, together with PA accommodation.",9cd1adb6-37e4-4f62-936e-aa76d65eeb4b
49,discussion14," The results from this study might suggest a simple, safe, and promising avenue to slow age-related neurodegeneration. Future studies are needed to explore the exact mechanisms of specific polyphenol-rich foods on brain anatomy and function.
