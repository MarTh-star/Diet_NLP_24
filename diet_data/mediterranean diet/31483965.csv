0,introduction0,"Dementia is considered as a major public health concern.1 Due to the ageing population, the number of dementia cases will increase substantially in the next decades. In 2015, more than 46 million people worldwide were affected by dementia and this number is expected to increase to 131 million by 2050.2 This rise in people with dementia carries a high economic and social burden for society.1 In 2015, global costs of dementia reached 818 billion US dollars and will increase further.3 Currently, no curative treatments are available. Therefore, prevention is a key element to counteract the dementia epidemic.4 5  The most common types of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (60%–70%), vascular dementia (VD) (15%–20%) or a combination of AD and VD (mixed dementia).6–8 The presence of a first-degree relative with AD doubles the risk for developing AD.9 This increased risk has several reasons.",01d26746-0d83-496a-b585-2edadc9affdc
1,introduction1," First, descendants of people with AD more often have a higher genetic predisposition for AD (eg, carrier of the apolipoprotein E (apolipoprotein E (APOE)) ε4 allele).9 Second, high blood pressure, vascular diseases and other vascular risk factors (ie, diabetes type 2, obesity, hypercholesterolemia) often cluster in families.10 Lastly, psychosocial behaviour runs in the family and also affects health behaviour and lifestyle.11 12 Not surprisingly, individuals with a parent who is recently diagnosed with AD or VD often worry about their own risk of developing dementia. Therefore, this life event (parental diagnosis of dementia) might encourage the willingness of individuals to change their health behaviour.13  Parental family history has been associated with an increased risk of dementia independently of known genetic risk factors.9 14 Therefore, a healthy lifestyle might be beneficial for individuals with a positive family history, especially for apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers.",d24faf5a-0f1f-449b-b25c-b0953930f5cf
2,introduction2,"15–18 Over the last decade, evidence of modifiable risk factors for dementia has been mounting.4 6 19 The Lancet commission on dementia prevention, intervention and care demonstrated that 35% of the dementia cases is attributable to modifiable risk factors (ie, less education, hearing loss, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, physical inactivity, social isolation and diabetes) and recommended to start interventions including more childhood education, promotion of physical exercise, reduction of smoking, maintaining social engagement and management of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, depression and hearing loss.4 6 20 Other major risk factors are hyperlipidaemia, coronary heart disease, renal dysfunction, Mediterranean diet and cognitive activity.",e9d9e2bd-d61f-42b2-aa26-db245bd748b6
3,introduction3,"19  Only a few studies examined the effectiveness of targeting these modifiable factors on cognitive decline and dementia incidence through a multidomain intervention, such as the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) study,21 the Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular care (PreDIVA) study22 and the The Multi-domain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (Multi domain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT)) study.23 These studies, with a follow-up varying from 2 to 6 years, found small or non-significant effects on cognition in older participants (eg, >60 years).21–23 Starting multidomain interventions earlier in life might be promising as cognitive decline begins already in midlife.24 25 However, since dementia is mainly prevalent in the elderly, a long follow-up period of approximately 20 years would be required in order to determine the effectiveness of interventions on dementia incidence.",6d09c430-192e-4d64-a461-894602565038
4,introduction4,"24–26 Furthermore, tailoring interventions improves the effectiveness of health behaviour change interventions.27 Web-based interventions have the potential to support health behaviour change as there is the opportunity to tailor lifestyle advice.28–31 They were especially effective when a theoretical basis or conceptual framework (eg, health belief model (health belief model (HBM)), transtheoretical model, theory of planned behaviour, I(integrated)-change model32–36), behaviour change techniques (eg, providing feedback on performance and information on the consequences of unhealthy behaviour) and several modes of delivery had been used.27  The first challenge of health behaviour change interventions is to achieve a high level of uptake for screening (eg, assessing risk and protective factors for dementia), reflecting the willingness to participate.",d603ff3a-1bf1-462c-8310-6d4a302a5b9b
5,introduction5," A systematic review identified a large variation in uptake in health checks and lifestyle intervention programmes,37 depending on the type of recruitment strategy. The two main types of strategies for recruitment are the active and passive recruitment strategy. Active recruitment involves a personal invitation by the project staff and healthcare providers (eg, proactive) and passive recruitment involves recruitment of participants through various channels such as flyers and advertisements (eg, reactive).38 The most effective recruitment strategy is a proactive referral from a healthcare provider, while displaying posters and flyers showed to be less effective.39 40 Uptake also depends on other factors as described in social cognition models (eg, knowledge, perceived susceptibility and severity, facilitators, benefits and barriers and attitude towards such interventions).",a3960f0b-0d8a-4d78-93a2-af7a9cb3e48a
6,introduction6,"32–36 These factors are essential and useful to make a well-informed decision about dementia risk assessment, considering the possible benefits and harms. Therefore, information on dementia, the risk and protective factors for dementia, heritability and how to tackle risk and protective factors for dementia are important factors in the development of a web-based intervention. A previous study showed that the majority of the Dutch general population is unaware of the relationship between modifiable risk factors and brain health, particularly regarding major cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart disease).41 It is shown that this lack of knowledge is a barrier to the uptake and maintenance of healthy behaviours for middle-aged individuals.42 Having a parent who is recently diagnosed with AD or VD could have led to an increased knowledge on dementia and risk perception.",52bd3fcb-b2a6-413f-a429-e5b4dffb51c7
7,introduction7,"13 Therefore, middle-aged descendants of recently diagnosed people with AD or VD might be receptive to assess their risk and motivated to adopt a healthier lifestyle as they just realised their (familial) risk.13 43 Although we expect that the uptake in the active recruitment strategy will be higher compared with the passive recruitment strategy, participants recruited via the passive recruitment strategy might be more intrinsically motivated to adopt and maintain their healthy lifestyle and less likely to drop out of the study.  To our knowledge, none of the health behaviour intervention studies were aimed at a specific group of middle-aged adults with increased risk for dementia due to their parental family history of dementia.",fa0522c1-69ec-4fd9-8866-dbe499bfdeca
8,introduction8," Therefore, this study aims to investigate the uptake and effectiveness of a tailor-made online lifestyle programme for dementia risk reduction (dementia risk reduction (DRR)) among middle-aged descendants of recently diagnosed (in the last 6 months) people with AD or VD in the Netherlands. This will give insight into what extent it is feasible to recruit middle-aged descendants of people with AD or VD at the memory clinics and whether these potential participants are willing to participate in a tailor-made online lifestyle programme in order to reduce their dementia risk.

Memory clinics allocated to the passive recruitment strategy, do not invite potential participants proactively, but invite potential participants to participate in the Demin study by posters and flyers that are placed in the waiting room of the memory clinic.

13,introduction13," As we expect a higher response rate in the active recruitment strategy group, we use an active:passive recruitment strategy ratio of 8:13 (see sample size calculations).  Study population Eligible participants are middle-aged individuals (40–60 years old) with a parent who is recently (less than 6 months ago) diagnosed with AD or VD (or mixed dementia) at one of the participating memory clinics in the Netherlands (see Acknowledgements section). Individuals should provide informed consent, be able to fill out an online Dutch questionnaire. Pregnant women are excluded from participation.  Sample size calculations The primary outcome measure is uptake, which is defined as the percentage of eligible individuals that signed the online informed consent form and completed baseline assessment (online questionnaire and physical examination and a fasting blood sample).",f2db4c9b-eace-4044-8762-6213b7887c28

To take cluster randomisation into account, we use the formula 1+((n−1)*ICC) (inflation factor), where n is the average number of included participants per memory clinic and ICC is Intra Class Correlation.45 The ICC is unknown, but an ICC of 0.05 is a common value for cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT)s in hospitals.46 The estimated average of included participants per memory clinic per year is n=15 using a passive recruitment strategy and n=25 using an active recruitment strategy, taking into account non-response. With unequal cluster sizes, ‘n’ is replaced by ‘m’, where m is the sum of (M)2/sum(M) ((152+252)/(15+25)).47 This results in a sample size inflation factor of (1+((21.25–1)*0.05)=2.01.",c00e1b39-26cc-460f-987b-b78a89cfb9e4

17,introduction17,"  Dementia risk assessment The dementia risk assessment consists of filling out an online questionnaire (in ‘My Demin’) and physical examination, including a fasting blood sample, at one of the 21 participating memory clinics in order to determine whether risk and protective factors are present. In order to minimise the amount of missing data, validation and skip-and-fail rules were implemented in the online questionnaire. Furthermore, automatic reminders are sent to the participant if the online questionnaire was not filled in within 2 weeks. Physical examination will be conducted by the team of the local memory clinic and includes the following measurements: height (in cm) (SECA 222 stadiometer), body weight (in kg) without shoes (SECA 761 scale), waist and hip circumference (in cm) (SECA 200 measuring tape) and three measurements of diastolic and systolic blood pressure (in mm Hg) (Welch Allyn ‘Spot Vital Signs’51).",8f60c1e8-e4c7-4d57-b7b9-a1a226d50267

The stages of change are categorised into pre-contemplation (1), contemplation (2), preparation (3), action (4) and maintenance (5).33  (3) Changes in beliefs and attitudes with regard to dementia risk reduction (DRR) are measured using the Motivation to Change Lifestyle and Health Behaviour for dementia risk reduction (DRR) Scale (MCLHB-dementia risk reduction (DRR) scale).61 62 The MCLHB-dementia risk reduction (DRR) scale is based on the health belief model (HBM),32 which explains health-related behaviours. Seven subscales of the health belief model (HBM) were included: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceives barriers, cues to action, general health motivation and self-efficacy. Participants are asked to rate all items on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from strongly disagree (score=1) to strongly agree (score=5).",d1c7dca1-a36f-480a-bc9f-06839ee1c8be
37,introduction37," A higher score on each subscale reflects a higher motivation to change their lifestyle and health behaviour for dementia risk reduction (DRR). The Dutch version of the MCLHB-dementia risk reduction (DRR) scale, consisting of 23 items, has shown to be valid in the Dutch general population aged between 30 and 80 years old.63  (4) Percentage of participants that indicated in the questionnaire that they have followed up the tailor-made online lifestyle advice (‘On what risk factors did you receive lifestyle advice?’ and ‘Did you follow-up the tailor-made lifestyle advice since the last questionnaire (with regard to (risk factor))’?, but also the percentage of participants that indicated that they have followed up the advice to consult their General Practitioner (‘Did you have contact with your general practitioner after receiving feedback on the risk and protective factors?’).  Statistical analyses First, descriptive characteristics will be explored.",95b216e6-c629-42e7-bf37-6f14fe18a151
38,introduction38," The difference in uptake between the two recruitment strategies will be examined using multilevel logistic regression analyses in order to correct for clustering at memory clinic level. We will calculate the percentage with the corresponding 95% CI and use an alpha of 0.05 to test statistical significance.  The effectiveness of the online tailor-made lifestyle programme for dementia risk reduction (DRR) will be determined by, first comparing the change in Lifestyle for Brain Health (LIBRA) score, the individual risk factors and the MCLHB-dementia risk reduction (DRR) score between the active and passive recruitment strategy, and second comparing participants of the Demin study (active and passive recruitment strategy) to a control group consisting of Lifelines participants (large population-based cohort study (n>167 000)) (www.lifelines.nl)64 in outcome.",685d4ffd-6f02-4771-b84d-8898610ad5cb
39,introduction39," Lifelines participants (age 40–60 years) with a parent with dementia will be matched (using propensity scores) on non-modifiable risk factors (age, gender and education) for dementia to participants of the Demin. Subsequently, multilevel analyses will be performed to examine the change in the Lifestyle for Brain Health (LIBRA) score and the individual health behaviours over time. In addition, possible confounding and interaction effects will be identified and corrected for in the analysis (eg, health literacy). We will calculate relative risks with 95% CIs and use an alpha of 0.05 to test significance.  Adverse events The risk classification of this intervention is considered negligible, since only information and health advice is provided. Serious adverse events as a result of the intervention are not expected, thus no data safety and monitoring board is installed. Potential participants are informed about possible adverse events.",6a258482-a527-4602-9894-0492e1032bd7
40,introduction40," For example, dementia risk assessment may help raising the awareness of their susceptibility in order to motivate health behaviour change,32 however, risk assessment could also have an unfavourable effect. Participants may become anxious about developing dementia and could experience more stress if they receive their health profile. Therefore, participants are clearly informed that the presence or absence of risk and protective factors is not a reassurance that they will develop dementia later in life. Furthermore, participants are informed that there is the possibility that unexpected medical findings can be found. In this case, participants receive a separate message in their personal inbox with the recommendation to contact their general practitioner to verify the results (hypertension, high cholesterol, renal dysfunction, diabetes) and discuss whether treatment is needed. Participants may consider online risk assessment as a privacy risk.",8da7bb7a-e838-45b6-88ae-f0f480c1c2d7

Patient and public involvement Descendants of people with dementia were involved in the development of the Demin website. We assessed the knowledge, beliefs and attitudes towards dementia and dementia risk reduction among descendants of people with dementia (focus group discussions). The results of the focus group discussions were used to develop the Demin website in order to improve the participant recruitment and encourage health behaviour change among participants.

Since these risk factors are merely lifestyle factors, a positive impact beyond dementia may be expected. Due to a healthy lifestyle more healthy life years are added to people’s lives, which may ultimately increase the risk on dementia as age is an important risk factor for dementia.
