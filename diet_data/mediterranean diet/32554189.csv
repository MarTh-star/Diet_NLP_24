0,introduction0," Chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease (CKD)) affects 9⋅1 % of the population worldwide, placing substantial burden on healthcare systems(1,2). The development and rapid progression of kidney dysfunction is associated with sub-optimal dietary intake(3). Not only is low diet quality detrimental to chronic kidney disease (CKD), it can also result in poor management of underlying comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension which can further progress chronic kidney disease (CKD)(3,4). For these reasons, there is potential for healthful dietary patterns, like the Mediterranean diet, to aid in the prevention and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD)(5).  Emerging evidence links a Mediterranean diet with improved cardiometabolic health, glycaemic control and reduced incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD)(5–8).",f3090d15-3b6f-430c-acb3-eb1b33e91331
1,introduction1," The Mediterranean diet is based on high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole-grain bread and cereals, olive oil, legumes, nuts and seeds; moderate intake of dairy products, egg, seafood, poultry and wine; low intake of red meat and discretionary foods(9). In a multi-centre trial, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts was associated with a 31 % lower incidence of major cardiovascular events in people at high cardiovascular risk(8). Moreover, the Mediterranean diet has been associated with lower blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein and higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD)(10). Likewise, adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with reduced levels of HbA1c, plasma glucose and insulin in adults with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus(11,12).",a61d8f49-0182-432d-9b30-7810d595bfae
2,introduction2," Lastly, a recent prospective cohort study among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients found that those with highest adherence to a Mediterranean diet had a lower adjusted risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression(13). Taken together, a Mediterranean diet seems to be a prudent diet for people at risk of or with chronic kidney disease (CKD), due to its impact on comorbidities, which may contribute to the development or progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).  The protective effects of a Mediterranean diet may not only be due to the intake of nutrients and foods but also include non-nutrient factors such as psychological, social and physical factors that represent a Mediterranean lifestyle(14,15). These factors have been shown to modulate comorbidities associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to a lesser extent, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its progression(16,17).",84e82694-aa3d-41c9-86b0-29f2898b21c6
3,introduction3," Physical activity is well documented to decrease body weight, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels(15,18–21). Moreover, sedentary behaviour and reduced physical activity are associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as increased mortality and decline in renal function in chronic kidney disease (CKD) populations(15,19). Socialisation has been identified to be inversely associated with the presence of hypertension(17) and depression(22). Lastly, conviviality has been associated with healthy weight, improved eating habits and dietary choices(23). Taken together, it appears the benefits of a Mediterranean lifestyle are not exclusive to dietary intake; thus, further consideration to its role in the health outcomes and progression of kidney disease in people with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) is warranted.",3a3cbce1-100c-4916-ba42-395540f43f52

5,methods0," Study design and setting  This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at the Nephrology department of the Sunshine Coast Hospital and Health Service, Queensland, Australia. People with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3 to 5 (eGFR ≤60 ml/min/1⋅73 m2) were recruited via convenience sampling. The chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage was determined according to the National Kidney Foundation clinical practice guidelines(24). The primary outcome was adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle and secondary outcomes were kidney function and cardiometabolic health. Dependent variables were kidney function (eGFR) and cardiometabolic markers (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HbA1c, random blood glucose and blood pressure). Independent variables included Mediterranean lifestyle adherence, socioeconomic status, the presence of comorbidities, age, weight and body mass index (body mass index (BMI)).",bb06f946-679f-421a-9f70-58b40cfab955

Ethical approval was obtained from the Prince Charles Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/17/QPCH/370) and the University of the Sunshine Coast Human Research Ethics committee (S181179).  Measurements  Height, weight and brachial blood pressure were measured by trained clinical nurses using standard protocols(25,26) during a routine visit at the Nephrology department.",38d7db0f-0c28-4111-9c27-0e2c1b6405cd

The most recent biochemical parameters (taken within the last 6-months), the number of diagnosed comorbidities (including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and depression) and medication use were recorded from medical charts.  Questionnaire  Socio-demographic information, source of nutrition information and Mediterranean lifestyle habits were assessed using a self-administered paper-based survey.

8,methods3,"  Mediterranean lifestyle habits  The Mediterranean lifestyle (Mediterranean Lifestyle (MEDLIFE)) index(28) was used to assess adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle, including diet, physical activity patterns and social interaction. The Mediterranean Lifestyle (MEDLIFE) index has been validated in a middle-aged Spanish working-class cohort and showed significant association with the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Index and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener(28). The index consists of 28-items which are divided into three blocks, namely (1) food consumption (fifteen items), (2) traditional Mediterranean dietary habits (seven items) and (3) physical activity, rest, social habits and conviviality (six items). In block one, participants self-reported the average number of serves of specific foods and beverages using visual guides on portion sizes which was provided by the research team.",6682eca2-55af-4327-b7d7-3a8fa579ec85
9,methods4," Block two and three indicated adherence to Mediterranean dietary and lifestyle habits, respectively. Each item was scored one point if the guideline was met or zero if the guideline was not met, resulting in a total score out of 28. The higher the score, the greater adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle is.  Sample size estimation  A total sample size of 102 was calculated using G-power(29) with a medium effect size (δ 0⋅50), 80 % power and significance set at P < 0⋅05 to identify differences between two independent groups. A total of 111 participants were recruited between July and September 2020, of which 12 participants did not return their surveys, resulting in a final sample size of 99 (89 % response rate).

23,discussion0," The present study aimed to investigate adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle and its association with cardiometabolic markers and kidney function in people with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD). Key findings include moderate adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle, employment was associated with higher adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle, components of Mediterranean dietary habits were associated with various cardiometabolic markers and those that ate with others had a lower occurrence of depression. No associations between kidney function and a Mediterranean lifestyle were found.  Evidence points toward an association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet, renal function and delayed chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression(5,30). In a systematic review of nine studies, increased adherence to a Mediterranean diet was significantly associated with a 10 % reduced risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in community-dwelling adults(31).",b009ed2a-0c58-4b3e-8c5f-81aafeb676fe
24,discussion1," Additionally, a cross-sectional study (n 2813) found that greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with higher eGFR in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3(32). No significant associations were observed between a Mediterranean lifestyle adherence and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the present study. This may be partly explained by the small sample size and the use of different tools to measure adherence to a Mediterranean diet and/or lifestyle. The present study assessed food intake, dietary habits, physical activity and social interaction which differs from the tools used in previous studies (e.g. Mediterranean Diet Score, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener, Mediterranean Diet Scale, Short Mediterranean Diet Questionnaire) that predominately focused on food and/or nutrients(33).",42570504-a6d0-4b04-801d-7eded12878a2
25,discussion2," Lifestyle factors such as physical activity and sedentary behaviour may be useful in the prevention of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression as well as comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease which are common among people with chronic kidney disease (CKD)(15,18–20). Therefore, the present study used an a priori index tool that included some of these lifestyle factors. Despite the lack of associations between kidney function and a Mediterranean lifestyle, we did find associations between Mediterranean lifestyle components and cardiometabolic markers which may act to modulate chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression(34). Nevertheless, the role of a Mediterranean lifestyle in the prevention of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression requires further investigation.",905d85f4-b9bf-4b60-9e49-1fa5f37be5cd
26,discussion3,"  Proposed strategies to attenuate chronic kidney disease (CKD) development and progression is to effectively manage risk factors of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including underlying comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes(16,34,35). Our findings demonstrated that adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle, especially Mediterranean dietary habits, was associated with favourable cardiometabolic health markers. These findings are supported by a meta-analysis of eleven studies(36) which reported that in non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) populations those with the highest adherence to a Mediterranean diet had 24 % lower risk of incident cardiovascular disease and 28 % lower risk of incident coronary heart disease. In agreement, a recent meta-analysis of six trials showed that the Mediterranean diet had positive effects on cardiovascular parameters, including total cholesterol and blood pressure(12).",68773077-6211-4a82-8680-1a4754e88d1a
27,discussion4," Likewise, a meta-analysis of nine randomised control trials demonstrated that a Mediterranean diet had beneficial effects on weight and cardiovascular risk factors (total cholesterol, triacylglycerols and blood pressure) in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus(11). Furthermore, a parallel-group, intervention trial that assessed the efficacy of Mediterranean diets on primary cardiovascular prevention (PREDIMED study) among 7447 people, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts, was associated with a lower rate of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke or death from cardiovascular causes) compared with a reduced-fat diet(8). Similarly, a cross-sectional study in Australia found that higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with lower total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure and a lower risk of dyslipidaemia(20).",36a644dd-4924-4a36-8a0d-0344050c27e6
28,discussion5," Taken together, a Mediterranean diet is effective to improve cardiovascular health, potentially reducing chronic kidney disease (CKD) development and progression(16). Notably, the role of dietary habits and other lifestyle factors, such as the physical lifestyle environment, was not assessed. A surprising result from the present study was the unexpected inverse association between total cholesterol and some Mediterranean dietary habits. This may be explained by the potential 6-month lag between the measurement of biochemical parameters and completion of the survey. Furthermore, perhaps individual dietary preferences did not necessarily translate into action.  Interestingly, an association between eating in company and lower presence of depression was identified in the present study. Eating in company represents social support and a sense of community; thus, conviviality of meals may positively affect dietary behaviour and, in turn, health status(14).",45fc1821-ddd4-4dde-bb0d-3db27417f325
29,discussion6," In fact, high adherence to a Mediterranean diet and socialisation was associated with a lower risk of developing depression in a prospective cohort study of Spanish adults(22). The present study, therefore, supports the notion that non-nutritional aspects of a Mediterranean lifestyle, such as social and cultural factors, are fundamental to help procure the well-known benefits of a Mediterranean lifestyle.  In the present study, adherence to certain Mediterranean dietary habits was associated with improved glycaemia and a lower frequency of diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our findings are in agreement with the body of evidence on the Mediterranean diet and glycaemia(11,12). A meta-analysis of nine studies, investigating the effects of a Mediterranean diet on glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk factors, highlighted that adherence was associated with reduced levels of HbA1c, fasting glucose and insulin among patients with type 2 diabetes(11).",1575dc08-7134-4140-8321-dd2d21c1d5e0
30,discussion7," Similarly, a meta-analysis of six studies found that a Mediterranean diet had positive effects on plasma glucose in most healthy adults(12). It is concluded that management of type 2 diabetes mellitus may improve with adherence to a Mediterranean diet, thereby slowing renal function decline.  Non-adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle was observed in the present study. Adherence may be influenced by contextual factors, including the fact that participants were from a non-Mediterranean country, as well as factors relating to food access, food acceptance and socio-cultural norms(18,37). Difficulty adhering to a Mediterranean diet within Australia, with the absence of an intensive intervention, was highlighted in a recent systematic review(37). Potential avenues to improve adherence included the translation of key Mediterranean diet principles into the Australian Dietary Guidelines, thus acknowledging socio-cultural norms, sustainability, acceptability and palatability(37).",5381ebfc-5866-4cd5-be7e-514418913090
31,discussion8," Nevertheless, further research is warranted into the transferability of a Mediterranean diet and lifestyle into recommendations for non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients from non-Mediterranean countries while maintaining associated health benefits. Employment was also linked with higher adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle in the present study. Evidence suggests improved health outcomes for older adults that maintain some form of employment status after the age of 65 years(37,38). With this in mind, the role of employment in achieving and maintaining a healthier lifestyle in older adults with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) needs further investigation.  The limitations of the present study include a small sample size, a single centre study and the use of self-reported tools which can result in reporting errors or bias(39–41).",dde68218-c010-4d2e-a07a-56991291e6f2
32,discussion9," Furthermore, there was potential for up to a 6-month variance between measured biochemical parameters and data collection within the research study. Due to financial constraints, fasting blood samples could not be taken at the time of the study but were sourced from medical records. Retirement was not recorded, and it was, therefore, not possible to distinguish between unemployment due to retirement or due to inability to secure work. As the majority of participants (71⋅7 %) were 65-years and older, it is possible that many were retired; however, it cannot be assumed. In addition, the cross-sectional nature of the study design precludes conclusions pertaining to causality between a Mediterranean lifestyle, kidney function and cardiometabolic markers(42).",d034f6b4-88fa-401d-b1a6-914168124e28
33,discussion10,"  Conclusion  In summary, despite only moderate adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle, components of a Mediterranean lifestyle were associated with improved health outcomes in this group of people with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present study extends the body of knowledge by highlighting the potential role of Mediterranean lifestyle factors such as dietary habits, the physical environment and social interaction on cardiometabolic markers, kidney function and/or other health outcomes in people with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD). Further studies are warranted in larger samples investigating the role of both dietary and non-dietary Mediterranean lifestyle factors in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as factors influencing adherence.
