0,methods0," This cross-sectional study was conducted in Italy and Romania from July to December 2018. The study population comprised Romanian children and adolescents aged 1–16 years, living in Cluj, North–West region of Romania, and in Italy (Liguria, Piedmont, Calabria, Lombardy, and Emilia Romagna). Both parents of each child were ethnic Romanian. Participants were recruited during a routine visit to a primary care pediatrician (primary care pediatrician (PCP)) or a consultation with a nutritionist (in Romania).  2.1. Weight and Height Assessment  The participants were weighed with minimal clothing using a high-precision scale, and their height was measured with an altimeter (1 mm accuracy). body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the ratio between weight (kg) and squared height (m2). This study did not aim to assess adherence to the MD based on weight status quantified on percentiles.",74a38782-0571-47ca-a203-47a48b216e48
1,methods1," body mass index (BMI) can be an important indicator of healthy growth and development and enables comparison between children of the same sex and age.  2.2. KIDMED Test  To assess the adherence to MD between the two groups, we used an adapted and translated version of the KIDMED Test (Mediterranean diet quality index for children and teenagers) [19,20]. The KIDMED test is a tool to evaluate the adherence to the MD for children and youths. It was developed and validated by Serra-Majem et al. [19]. The translations to Romanian and Italian were carried out by the authors of the study. The anonymous questionnaire was completed by parents without supervision of the primary care pediatrician (PCP) or nutritionist (Table 1).",ce053bea-9289-4060-b91c-c9cb40b19e3f
2,methods2,"  The index is based on a 16-question test that explores the consumption of fruits, vegetables, fish, pasta/rice, cereals, yoghurt/cheese/dairy products, nuts, commercial baked and processed foods, breakfast habits and the frequency of skipping breakfast, fast food intake frequency, sweets consumption, and olive oil use during meal at home. Questions denoting a negative connotation with respect to the MD were assigned a value of −1 (4 questions), and those with a positive one a value of +1 (12 questions). The overall score could range from 0 to 12. The sum obtained by adding the value of each question each was classified into three levels:(1) >8: optimal Mediterranean diet;  (2) 4–7: improvement needed to adjust intake to Mediterranean patterns;  (3) ≤3: extremely low diet quality [20].  2.3. Statistical Analysis  The normality of the analyzed samples was evaluated with the Shapiro–Wilk test, and the results were expressed as means ± standard deviation.",4e832c20-d87c-4e19-bdfb-589e1ee51261
3,methods3," Student’s independent t-test and Mann–Whitney U-test were used for normal distributed variables. Two-tailed chi-square or Fisher exact test was used to evaluate differences in categorical variables, as appropriate. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were carried out using the software package XLSTAT, version 2016.03.31199.  2.4. Ethical Approval  This cross-sectional study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee (11/NW/0409) and Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca ethics committee (196/19 April 2018). All subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study.  3. Results  A total of 530 participants enrolled in the study, 414 Romanian children in Romania (RCR) and 116 Romanian children in Italy (RCI), aged 1–16, with balanced distribution between sexes (Table 2).",c22b2b98-fc7a-44d8-8ee7-bb51ae2739e6
4,methods4,"  Regarding the place of residence, most of the Romanian children in Romania (RCR) and Romanian children in Italy (RCI) lived in large towns (more than 60,000 inhabitants) and villages (less than 5000 inhabitants) (large towns, 41.37% Romanian children in Italy (RCI) versus 34.54% Romanian children in Romania (RCR); small towns, 8.62% Romanian children in Italy (RCI) versus 11.11% Romanian children in Romania (RCR); villages, 49.13% Romanian children in Italy (RCI) versus 45.89% Romanian children in Romania (RCR); countryside: 0.86% Romanian children in Italy (RCI) versus 8.45% Romanian children in Romania (RCR)). Most Romanian children in Italy (RCI) had been living in Italy for more than 5 years (53.44%) and 18.10% for 4 or 5 years (data not shown).",478d0d33-3a91-46da-9555-58767ca2e729
5,methods5,"  We assessed the parents’ employment status (1 = craftsman; 2 = domestic worker; 3 = commercial worker; 4 = unemployed, 5 = employee; 6 = freelancer; 7 = factory worker), and our results indicated that in most cases, mothers of Romanian children in Romania (RCR) were employed (32.6%), while mothers of Romanian children in Italy (RCI) were either unemployed (39.65%) or domestic workers (27.58%). More than half of fathers of Romanian children in Romania (RCR) were artisans (21.74%) or clerks (31.64%), while 54.31% of fathers of Romanian children in Romania (RCR) were laborers (Figure 1).  It is noteworthy that 43.71% of Romanian children in Romania (RCR) allocated more than 3 h per week to physical activities as compared with 14.65% of Romanian children in Italy (RCI) (Figure 2). Most of Romanian children in Italy (RCI) (33.62%) did not have the possibility to practice physical activities (Figure 2).",6e07b687-6b75-4e3e-912f-04d1cb5aad76
6,methods6,"  Among Romanian children in Romania (RCR), the main seasoning was olive oil (39%), while among Romanian children in Italy (RCI), there was an increased usage of EVOO (33.54%). Both populations used butter, lard, seeds and olive oil (37.84% in Romanian children in Italy (RCI) versus 34.56% in Romanian children in Romania (RCR)) (Figure 3).  Regarding the KIDMED’s questions, it is worth mentioning that there were statistically significant differences between the Romanian children in Italy (RCI) and Romanian children in Romania (RCR) groups. Romanian children in Italy (RCI) consumed more fruits, vegetables, fish, olive oil but also more pasta/rice, fast food, pastries, and sweets as compared with Romanian children in Romania (RCR). Romanian children in Romania (RCR) had an increased daily consumption of yoghurts and/or cheese (40 g) compared with Romanian children in Italy (RCI) (Table 3).",49ee2bf7-78a7-4dbf-bb0d-adf2ac9b55d6
7,methods7,"  Even though there was no statistical difference between groups regarding the average KIDMED index (5.48 in Romanian children in Italy (RCI) and 5.39 in Romanian children in Romania (RCR)), most of Romanian children in Romania (RCR) had a medium KIDMED index (63.12%) versus 12.93% in Romanian children in Italy (RCI) (p < 0.05), while a large number of participants from the Romanian children in Italy (RCI) group presented high KIDMED (68.09%) index relative to Romanian children in Romania (RCR) (17.76%) (p < 0.05) (Figure 4).  4. Discussion  The MD is characterized by a high amount of polyphenols, dietary fiber, and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. This complex mixture of nutrients plays an important role both in the prevention of NCDs and in providing a favorable gut microbiota profile (Figure 5) [21,22].",d1236e26-67ff-469d-b092-dc97c8d0ae0f
8,methods8," The link between the antioxidant effect of polyphenols and the decrease in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, as well as the positive effect on mental and reproductive health is well known. Due to the high production of short chain fatty acids (butyrate species), induced by MD, the subjects who follow the diet seem to have a lower incidence and risk of progression for several intestinal diseases, some types of cancer as well as the reduction of the cardio-metabolic pathologies [21,23,24].  Most of the studies evaluating adherence to MD among children have been carried out in Greece or Spain. There were some studies conducted in Italy as well [26,27,28,29], but none have evaluated MD adherence between Romanian children in Italy (RCI) and Romanian children in Romania (RCR) so far.",dec49d5d-dd62-4c2d-bd56-23375ffce490
9,methods9," In Italy, the Romanian community is very well represented; on 31 December 2018, Romanian residents in Italy numbered 1,190,091, confirming its position as the leading foreign community [30]. The aim of this study was to make an initial assessment of changes in the dietary habits between the Romanian children in Italy (RCI) and Romanian children in Romania (RCR) population.  Our data showed that Romanian children in Italy (RCI) acquired some typical habits of the Italian population: Romanian children in Italy (RCI) had a higher score in some items typical of MD (Table 3). In fact, they ate more frequently a second fruit per day, they ate raw or cooked vegetables more than once a day, they consumed fish regularly (at least 2–3 times/week) and pasta or rice almost every day; they also used olive oil as seasoning at home.",7b72a38d-0789-43a4-b905-7356573b87e7
10,methods10," On the other hand, Romanian children in Romania (RCR) reached a higher KIDMED score on other items: they went less frequently to fast food restaurants, they ate less sweets or candies during the week, and they consumed fewer pastries or other similar foods for breakfast. They also maintained some traditional Romanian habits, like regular consumption of nuts, yoghurts, and cheese, habits that are less well preserved by Romanian children in Italy (RCI).  Food consumption is affected by different factors, including food availability, accessibility, and choices, which in turn may be influenced by geography, demography, socioeconomic status, urbanization, globalization, marketing, and consumers [31]. Romanian families who came to Italy improved their social status and have greater and easier access to certain typical Italian foods (fruits, fish, olive oil) that are cheaper there than in their country of origin.",20107966-e66f-4da4-a6ff-4f341cd14a9a
11,methods11," At the same time, the globalization of fast food is beginning to influence the eating patterns of children in several countries, including Italian-native children and Romanian children in Italy (RCI). It is possible that for many Romanian children in Italy (RCI) families, gathering in fast food restaurants is also a way of socializing and spending leisure time at weekends. Westernized lifestyle is also seen in Spain and Greece [32,33].  Given the fact that younger people are fast-food consumers and the role of grandparents in transmission of healthy eating habits in not always possible for the Romanian children in Italy (RCI) population, school menus and education regarding healthy lifestyle in schools become increasingly important [34].  Some previous studies had found a correlation between MD and a lower body mass index (BMI) [35,36,37,38]. In the study conducted by Tognon et al.",27c04352-f65d-4982-afdf-a0c75a96ebcb
12,methods12," [39], high frequency-based Mediterranean diet score (fMDS) at baseline protected against increases in body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio. In our research, there was no difference between body mass index (BMI) of Romanian children in Italy (RCI) and Romanian children in Romania (RCR) (17.24 ± 3.37 kg/m2 versus 18.17 ± 4.07 kg/m2). Alkerwi et al. indicate that the odds of overweight or obesity were significantly higher among immigrants as compared with a native population [40]. Higher openness to change in immigrants is correlated to increased probability of interactions involving discrimination, making the children more vulnerable to stress and consequently to an increase in food intake [41,42]. One hypothesis could be the compensation between those two processes, namely, decrease in body mass index (BMI) due to the adherence to MD but an increased caloric intake due to the adaptation stress.",0b9f7fdb-886e-4642-9777-3bb72adf601d
13,methods13," Moreover, no correlation between the place of residence, immigration period, and KIDMED index was observed in our data, neither in Romanian children in Italy (RCI) nor in Romanian children in Romania (RCR) population.  As Petre pointed out, Romania has a relatively high consumption of olive products. Compared with other countries, in Romania, more olives are consumed than in Poland and, surprisingly, than in Greece. Additionally, from 2001 to 2017, the imported quantity of olives increased by 84%. These data support our results that indicate that 39.12% of Romanian children in Romania (RCR) consume olive oil, even though Romanian climate is inadequate for olive culture. There are several possible explanations, including the impact of nutrition education over food habits (especially in some social segments) and the practice of religious fasting periods associated with abstinence from animal foods [43].",e13be870-bcb3-4a97-8dc1-3249d6bd29eb
14,methods14,"  One of the more significant findings which emerged from this study is that the high KIDMED index among Romanian children in Italy (RCI) was significantly higher than the same index among Romanian children in Romania (RCR) (68.09 versus 17.76, p < 0.05). Therefore, the immigration period (more than 5 years in 53.44% of cases) was long enough to produce a shift in the alimentation pattern. The importance of EVOO for health is increasingly well known, and greater accessibility to this product for Romanian children in Italy (RCI) could be the key factor in improving their health [44]. Romanian children in Romania (RCR) are less influenced by MD for cultural reasons linked also to the social-geographical distance with respect to the Mediterranean culture.",08766e7c-5825-48e7-a833-50c292f8236e
15,methods15," Our data on adherence to MD among Romanian children in Italy (RCI) are in line with those of other studies conducted in southern European countries: about half of pediatric individuals have an average adherence, while nearly half may have poor adherence. MD adherence varies in the literature from 4.3% in Greek 10–12-year-old adolescents to 53.9% in Spanish children [45,46].  The beneficial effects of MD must be supported by sustained physical activity both in the family and at school. Our data regarding physical activity are in accordance with literature data that indicate decreased physical exercise among immigrants: 33.62% of Romanian children in Italy (RCI) declared no possibility for these activities, whereas 43.71% of Romanian children in Romania (RCR) exercised more than 3 h per day. These results are not likely to be related to the place of residence as both groups exhibit quite a balanced place of residence distribution.",03d50eb6-2ff7-40b3-af5a-297f28c2ec30
16,methods16," The main difference we saw was in the percentage living in countryside (0.86% in Romanian children in Italy (RCI) versus 8.45% in Romanian children in Romania (RCR)) [47,48].  Bawaked et al. [49] observed that a higher level of schooling correlates with better adherence to MD in Spanish children compared with peers whose mothers have only primary education. A high maternal educational level implies better nutritional knowledge, food choices, and parenting practices. Full maternal awareness of healthy eating promotion appeared to have a protective effect against the development of childhood obesity and/or overweight. Most of the mothers of the Romanian children in Italy (RCI) were unemployed (39.65%), while fathers were predominantly factory workers (54.31%), whereas the larger part of Romanian children in Romania (RCR) parents were employees. These discrepancies shaped the time spent with children, the family earnings, and the dietary habits.",70d7d06a-2f27-4a77-9ed9-2c02ce07570d
17,methods17," The role of the mother in the family context is crucial in determining quality and quantity of children’s nutrition; the urbanization of life, linked to a more stressful lifestyle in migrant people, with less time spent on cooking, more time out of home, and dinner as the principal meal consumed with the family, could influence the food choices of the youngest children [26].  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as observed in the study by Albuquerque et al. [50], also depends on family income: higher adherence to MD is associated with higher cost. A possible consequence of augmented costs of healthier diets, such as MD, is an elevated prevalence of low-quality meals among less fortunate families, who cannot afford these foods, and therefore are more likely to buy energy dense foods (energy dense foods (EDF)), which are less nutrient-rich but lower in price.  A number of caveats need to be noted regarding the present study.",95231e81-b525-4b56-9bdd-8461ec57b424
18,methods18," Adherence indexes, such as the KIDMED score, have been validated and used in epidemiological surveys, but their reliability and reproducibility in assessing diet quality in the individual subjects have not been demonstrated yet [45,46]. On the other hand, the KIDMED score is the most used index of adherence in pediatric literature. It is easy to complete by the respondent and easy to evaluate by the interviewer.  Another limitation of the study is the difference in sample size between the two groups examined, caused by the challenges of recruiting subjects in Italy. This renders problematic the stratification of our data in order to obtain more specific results, related to age, immigration period, area of residence, etc.  Another important assessment that should be taken into consideration in future research is the information about sleep pattern, level of parental education and income, sedentary habits (screen time), and school performance.",aab10d1f-f3bb-472e-806a-bf486305b12d
19,methods19,"  We consider that public school plays a major role in the health education. It would be beneficial if the school assigned some curriculum time to health education and to training teachers to use classroom content and methods in order to promote health. A school dietician that could orient children towards a healthy alimentation and train their families to improve the choice of the primary alimentary products might be an important figure. The enlarged team involved in nutrition education should also include a pediatrician and a nutritionist. A two-point increase in the adherence to MD was significantly associated with a reduced risk in overall mortality (9%), mortality from cardiovascular diseases (9%), incidence of or mortality from cancer (6%), and incidence of Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease (13%) [51].  5. Conclusions  In recent years, there has been an increase in the attention paid to nutrition, especially in lifestyle interventions for diseases prevention.",c4dc0ba4-c898-48e3-96a4-68948d06b7d9
20,methods20," Special attention was paid to eating behaviors due to the alarming boost in obesity rate, which is an increasingly common condition even among children. Learning to eat well is an important aspect of the child’s education and is likely to be conditioned by both the economic possibilities and the cultural level of the family of origin.  Our study showed that the adherence to MD was higher among Romanian children in Italy (RCI). Besides cultural eating habits, in Italy, the access to olive oil and EVOO, fish, and legumes is easier. At the same time, Romanian children in Italy (RCI) eat more junk food due to the influence of the westernized lifestyle.  These types of studies are increasingly important for assessing changes in eating habits in a globalized world, where cultural exchange and population movements are more and more frequent.
