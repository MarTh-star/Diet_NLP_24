0,methods0,"We used data from participants of the Newborn Epigenetics Study (Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST)), a cohort of women–infant dyads from central North Carolina. Enrollment details have been described elsewhere [34]. In brief, 1700 women enrolled during pregnancy between 2009 and 2011 at qualifying prenatal clinics. Women met the following inclusion criteria: 18 years of age or older, plan to deliver in one of two birthing facilities in Durham county, and English or Spanish speaking. We excluded women who planned to give up custody of their child and those who did not carry offspring to term. Of the 1700 enrolled, 1304 remained after additional exclusions (n = 115 experienced a fetal death, n = 281 refused further participation or an inability to follow-up with the participant). We collected blood and obtained cadmium measures for the first n = 310 women.",1a91a18a-6c06-4a65-8c8d-1d19db079a9f
1,methods1," Of the 310, n = 298 had non-missing values for birth weight, and n = 185 women completed a food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)). The median gestational age at enrollment was 11–12 weeks. We have previously shown that the 310 mother–infant pairs in whom cadmium was measured did not vary significantly from the remainder of the cohort [14]. The n = 185 on whom food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data were available also did not differ from the 310 with respect to sex, race/ethnicity and maternal obesity distribution (p > 0.05). Those included were, however, more likely to have a higher educational level and older maternal age at delivery (p < 0.05). These factors were adjusted for in the analysis. The women in our cohort were not significantly different with respect to covariates from the women in the overall Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST) cohort (p > 0.05).",857bb5fc-790a-464b-86d4-e121b6d73423
2,methods2," This study was approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board (#Pro00014548) on 19 February 2020.  2.1. Cadmium Exposure We measured cadmium in whole blood for the first 310 enrolled women at a median gestation age of 12 weeks, using ICP-MS and methods previously described in detail [11,13]. Because cadmium co-occurs with other environmental pollutants [35], we also measured lead and arsenic. Briefly, we measured prenatal cadmium concentrations in whole blood donated at enrollment as nanograms per gram (ng/g; 1000 ng/g = 1035 ng/μL) of blood weight using well-accepted solution-based ICP-MS methods. We homogenized temperature equilibrated whole blood samples (0.2 mL) and pipetted them into a trace metal-clean test tube. We used a calibrated mass balance to confirm the samples gravimetrically to ±0.",76ef42da-188f-48f2-9753-35180ca1c3b6

We then diluted the solutions with water purified to 18.2 MΩ/cm resistance, which we will refer to as Milli-Q water (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and acidified the solutions using ultra-pure 12.4 mol/L hydrochloric acid to result in a final concentration of 2% hydrochloric acid (by volume). We prepared all standards, including aliquots of the certified NIST 955c, and procedural blanks using the same process. We measured Cd concentrations using a Perkin Elmer DRC II (Dynamic Reaction Cell) axial field ICP-MS at Duke School of the environment, Durham, NC, USA. Calibration standards used to assess metals in blood included aliquots of Milli-Q water, and NIST 955c SRM spiked with known quantities of each metal in a linear range from 0.025 to 10 ng/g.",5a30b6f6-9a3d-4b6b-bbbf-d7287a499c35
4,methods4," We prepared standards from 1000 mg/L single element standards (SCP Science, USA). We calculated method detection limits (MDLs) consistent with the two-step approach using the t99SLLMV method (USEPA, 1993) at 99% CI (t = 3.71). The MDLs generated values of 0.006, 0.005, and 0.071 μg/dL, for cadmium, lead and arsenic, respectively. The thresholds of detection (LODs) were 0.002, 0.002, and 0.022 μg/dL, for Cd, Pb and As, respectively, and limits of quantification (LOQs) (according to Long and Winefordner, 1983) were 0.0007, 0.0006, and 0.0073 μg/dL for Cd, Pb, and As, respectively. The number of samples below the LOD for Cd, Pb, and As were two, two, and one, respectively.  2.2. Mediterranean Diet We measured overall diet using a modified food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) [36] at enrollment. Women were asked to report their usual intake over the past 3 months, allowing us to capture the periconceptional period.",6e10cfd4-6457-4365-9779-b32d9f3b5334
5,methods5," We scored women’s diets using the data-driven Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) [37]. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) assesses adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern based on the reported intake of foods that are deemed to be beneficial: fruit, vegetables, fish, dairy, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and monounsaturated fatty acids, and foods that are deemed detrimental: meat. We excluded alcohol from the diet score, as alcohol is not generally recommended during pregnancy and the reported alcohol intake in our cohort was low. Women who reported an intake of a beneficial foods at or above the median for the study population received a score of 1 and 0 otherwise. Those who reported an intake of detrimental foods below the median received a score of 1 or 0 otherwise.",52ce58a8-88e6-42d3-9094-4290ec77c653
6,methods6," The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) ranges from 0 to 9, with 0 representing the lowest possible adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern and 9 representing the highest adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern. We assessed maternal Mediterranean diet adherence as low (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) at or below 4) and high (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) above 4).  2.3. Birth Outcomes At delivery, we abstracted parturition data, including infant birth weight and gestational age, from medical records. We used standard definitions for low birth weight (≤2500 g) and preterm birth (<37 weeks). We assessed birth weight continuously and preterm birth categorically (>37 weeks gestation/≤37 weeks gestation). We assessed infant Apgar scores continuously (1–10), with a higher score reflecting a greater level of health at birth. We also assessed birth length (cm), and derived the infant ponderal index (PI) at birth.",f79df0dd-440b-428f-8609-7fcc7f599eaa
7,methods7," PI is a measure of the proportionality of body growth and is calculated using the formula: weight (g) × (100/length (cm3)).  2.4. Statistical Analysis We used a linear regression to assess the association between elevated cadmium exposure during pregnancy and birth weight, and a logistic regression to assess the association between elevated cadmium exposure and preterm birth. In our study, cadmium was severely right-skewed. Despite log transformation, the skewness did not improve (results using the continuous log Cd variables are available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2). As cadmium exposure is ubiquitous, we assessed cadmium in quartiles and defined high cadmium exposure as having a cadmium blood level in the highest quartile (mean Cd (ng/g) per quartile: 25th percentile: 0.12, 50th percentile: 0.24, 75th percentile: 0.46).",90d1ddba-6cf1-4af7-8cc8-12c20000450a
8,methods8," We identified potential confounders a priori based on the literature and substantive knowledge and selected a final set of confounders using Bayesian Information Criteria (Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC)). We included prepregnancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy, and sex of the infant as confounders in our final models. In our analysis of birth weight, we also included gestational age as a confounder and in our analysis of preterm birth we included birth weight as a confounder in the model. We assessed effect measure modification by Mediterranean diet adherence by including an interaction term in our models and by stratification of high and low maternal Mediterranean diet adherence. Effect measure modification analyses are limited to the 185 women who completed first trimester food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s and had cadmium measures available.",876b742f-882e-4f78-abbf-62b347826ffd
9,methods9," We conducted supplemental analysis to explore possible changes in the association between prenatal cadmium exposure and birth outcomes using different cut points for high and low Mediterranean diet adherence. Additionally, we explored the association between prenatal cadmium exposure and (1) infant Apgar score, (2) infant ponderal index at birth.  3. Results We present study participant demographic factors overall, and by birth weight (Table 1) and Mediterranean diet adherence (Table 2). Of the 298 women included in our sample, 36% were Black, 28% were white, 32% were Latina or Hispanic, and 4% were of other race/ethnicities. Approximately one-quarter of women had a BMI of 30 or greater, and about 75% of obese women were either African American or Hispanic. Over half of our sample (55%) had a high school diploma. Among infants in our study, 6% were born prior to 37 weeks gestation and 5.7% weighed 2500 g or less at birth.",a38d41c9-2293-4e63-bb61-4d95d7959a43
10,methods10," Approximately 20% of mothers in our study reported smoking during pregnancy. The median (in our study reported smoking during pregnancy The median (IQR)) of cadmium concentration in blood was 0.24 (0.34) ug/g of blood weight, and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) scores were normally distributed and ranged from 0 to 9 and approximately half of the women in our study had a score at or below 4. Women who did not deliver a low birth weight infant were more likely to be white, non-smokers, and have a college degree.  3.1. Cadmium Exposure and Birth Weight Results of the associations between cadmium and birth weight are summarized in Table 3. After adjustment for prepregnancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy, gestational age, and sex of the infant, we observed that the women in the highest quartile of cadmium exposure during the prenatal period had infants whose birth weights were 210 g lower (β = −210.4; 95% CI: −332.0, −88.8; p = 0.008) than those in the lower three quartiles.",0b642dd6-8812-4c05-aef4-5397f040c9b6
11,methods11," Further including other co-occurring metals, lead and arsenic, that also have been linked to lower birth weights did not alter these associations. We explored removing gestational age from these models, as it may be on the causal pathway. This somewhat attenuated the association, however, it remained statistically significant (β = −161.6; 95% CI: −311.3, −11.9; p = 0.04). Further adjusting the co-occurrence of other metals, including lead or arsenic, did not materially alter these findings (data not shown).  We also regressed gestational age at birth on cadmium exposure, controlling for the same covariates (Table 4). We found that preterm birth is marginally associated with prenatal cadmium exposure (β = −0.11; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.72; p = 0.04) (Table 2). We included birth weight as a confounder in our main analysis and explored the effect of removing it in a supplemental analysis.",328efee5-3ba5-4f46-973e-2bc3023c5892
12,methods12," When birth weight was removed from the model, the association between elevated prenatal cadmium exposure and preterm birth was no longer statistically significant (β = 1.2; 95% CI: 0.37, 3.31; p = 0.74). Again, further adjustment for the co-occurring metals, lead and arsenic, did not alter these findings, suggesting that growth restriction, rather than preterm birth, may be the major contributor to these birth outcomes.  3.2. Stratification by Mediterranean Diet Adherence To determine whether these associations were modified by adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern, we first dichotomized the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) below the median (a score of 4 of 9) among the n = 185 of 310 pregnant women who also completed the food frequency questionnaire. We examined cadmium-birth outcome associations among low and high adherers to the Mediterranean diet.",a56700bb-4b8f-417f-b890-683fc1051ae2
13,methods13," We found no evidence for effect measure modification by Mediterranean diet adherence in the association between prenatal cadmium exposure and either gestational age or birth weight. Among women who reported high adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern during pregnancy, the magnitude of the association between prenatal cadmium exposure and birth weight (β = −126.46; 95%CI: −453.14, 200.22; p = 0.44) was indistinguishable from the β = −210.38 observed among all participants. Similarly, the association between prenatal cadmium exposure and birth weight among women with low Mediterranean adherence was not statistically significant (β = −64.76; 95% CI: −359.90, 230.37; p = 0.66) (Table 3). However, these risk estimates lacked precision as confidence intervals were wide. We also observed no evidence for effect measure modification by maternal Mediterranean diet adherence on the association between prenatal cadmium exposure and preterm birth (high adherence: β: 0.01; 95% CI: 0, 1.59; p = 0.",661704e3-fdb8-4336-b4eb-f27d1be610a1
14,methods14,"20; low adherence: β: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.0008, 1.31; p = 0.14) (Table 4). As expected from stratified analyses, including the interaction term of the Mediterranean diet adherence score and cadmium exposure did not alter these findings. The p-values for the interaction terms of cadmium and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in the overall birthweight or preterm birth models were not significant (p > 0.15). Defining “high Mediterranean adherence” with a more stringent cut-off of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) of 5, 6 or 7 did alter these findings (data not shown).  3.3. Exploratory Analyses: Apgar Scores and PI In our exploratory analyses we found no association between elevated prenatal cadmium exposure and Apgar scores (β = −0.009; 95% CI: −0.13, 0.12; p = 0.89) or PI (β = −0.03; 95% CI: −0.11, 0.06; p = 0.51). Results available in Supplemental Table S3.  4. Discussion Understanding the effects of cadmium in early life is important, as this toxic metal is ubiquitous in the environment.",73d8eae6-2425-495e-ba6b-2dbc94b895bb
15,methods15," With no set upper threshold for children, the accepted tolerable limits based on body weight are likely detrimental to children whose body weight is also smaller. In these analyses, we evaluated the extent to which adherence to a Mediterranean diet modified the association of cadmium and poor birth outcomes. We found that elevated prenatal cadmium exposure was associated with a lower birth weight compared to infants born to mothers with average or low cadmium exposure during pregnancy. These associations persisted after further adjusting for other co-occurring toxic metals that have been previously associated with these poor birth outcomes. Furthermore, after removing gestational age as a confounder, the association between prenatal cadmium exposure and birth weight remained significant. However, the association between prenatal cadmium exposure and preterm birth lost significance after removing birth weight.",d9d63fe9-1471-49ba-bf94-4f4d15c45e87
16,methods16," We found no association between prenatal cadmium exposure and Apgar score or infant PI at birth.  Our findings are consistent with previous data from our group and others that have demonstrated that prenatal exposure to cadmium, at non-occupational levels, is associated with lower birth weight [10,11,12] and is not associated with preterm birth [10,38]. These findings are, however, not consistent with the hypothesis that dietary patterns rich in iron, selenium, and folate may mitigate exposure. We did not find evidence to support our hypothesis that adherence to a Mediterranean diet prenatally modifies the associations between cadmium exposure and poor birth outcomes, regardless of the cut-off used to define “high Mediterranean adherence”. While sample size limits inference, these data suggest that, in this population, at these cadmium levels, adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern may not modify the effects of prenatal cadmium exposure on birth outcomes.",b39e253a-98f5-4c4f-963f-e2547e6fe6dc
17,methods17," We were also interested in understanding whether the association between prenatal cadmium exposure and adverse birth outcomes was related to growth restriction or shortened gestation. In our exploratory analysis, the association between cadmium exposure and birth weight remained significant after excluding gestational age from the model; however, the association between cadmium exposure and preterm birth was no longer significant after excluding birth weight. This suggests that cadmium exposure may influence birth weight through growth restriction rather than shortened gestation.  To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to determine the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the association between prenatal cadmium concentrations and documented poor birth outcomes in humans. Previous animal- and cell-based studies have shown that a dietary intake of iron, calcium, selenium, and folate can reduce toxicity from cadmium exposure [20,21].",6f4e09e3-e8d9-41e1-83e2-c784b3f3ca7d
18,methods18," The Mediterranean diet pattern has been found to be a rich source of iron, folate, and selenium [39]. Thus, our analysis showing that adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern during pregnancy did not change the association between prenatal cadmium exposure and birth weight or preterm birth was surprising. The average intake of selenium in the US is high at 108.5 mcg/day [40], the intake of iron and calcium from food is lower than recommended at 11.5–13.7 mg/day [40] and 748 to 968 mg/day (females) [41], respectively, and the intake of folate is insufficient for pregnancy at 455 mcg DFE/day (females) [40]. It is possible that usual eating patterns in the US may not provide sufficient amounts of these nutrients to mitigate elevated cadmium exposure; therefore, diet interventions that encourage following a diet pattern with higher levels of iron, calcium, and folate may be warranted.",de49ac90-ba0e-412e-879f-dcfa95bda1b4
19,methods19," Interventions focused on dietary modifications may hold better prospects for implementation and adherence in exposed populations when compared to interventions focused on costly landscape remediation. Additionally, dietary intervention does not carry the health risks associated with cadmium chelation using agents such as EDTA.  The inability to find associations could be due to one of several possibilities, some related to how cadmium is estimated, and others related to the measurement of diet. For example, maternal circulating levels of cadmium may not reflect cadmium levels that the offspring may be exposed to, as there is evidence in support of cadmium being sequestered by the placenta [42]. Secondly, because in the United States the main source of cadmium in the diet is lettuce, milk and cookies [43], it is possible that the additional exposure to cadmium may overwhelm the nutritive benefits of this diet.",d8050d45-2f36-4c11-aa97-3dd80ced7880
20,methods20," It is also possible that women’s intake in our sample may not represent a true Mediterranean diet pattern, even at high Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) values, as food choices and availability may differ by country [44]. Additionally, it may be that adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern does reduce the effects of cadmium exposure on lower birth weight, yet we were underpowered to detect the associations. Although we were unable to establish a modifying effect of Mediterranean diet on the association between prenatal cadmium exposure and birth outcomes, the Mediterranean diet has been shown to protect against a number of diseases and inflammatory processes in the body [45], thus providing a rationale for its continued study. Given the ubiquity of this toxic metal in the environment, the effects of cadmium on birth outcomes, and the plausibility that a Mediterranean diet may mitigate the adverse effects, repeating these analyses in larger data sets is warranted.",3533cb2e-1805-40da-8cbd-67e87edc2ced
21,methods21,"  Our study findings should be interpreted in the context of the study limitations. In addition to being underpowered to detect a significant effect measure modification that may have existed, both the measurement of Mediterranean diet adherence and our inability to “remove” the effects of dietary items such as lettuce and milk, which are major sources of cadmium in the US, is a limitation. An analysis of these relationships in different populations may clarify these findings. Furthermore, although implausible values were excluded from analyses, the Mediterranean diet was computed from self-reported diet data, which may have led to misclassified food intake that may be further biased by social desirability. This may have led to the under-reporting of unhealthy foods and the over-reporting of healthy foods. An additional limitation is the use of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) to assess diet.",5eefe64d-3f2e-4359-94d8-cf1b5a042a01
22,methods22," Although widely used and associated with a number of health outcomes, the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) does not assess many foods that are thought to be “detrimental”, such as sugar or highly processed convenience foods.  Despite this, our study also exhibits strengths. We used prospectively collected data, therefore we can establish the timing of exposure, modifiers, and outcomes. Another important strength of this study is that it assessed maternal dietary patterns rather than the intake of single nutrients. Humans consume most of their nutrients through foods and combinations of nutrients, therefore it is important to assess the role of dietary patterns in the potential mitigation of negative consequences from toxic exposures.  5. Conclusions These limitations notwithstanding, this study contributes to the growing literature on the effects of toxic exposures during pregnancy and adds information on the potential role of diet in preventing adverse birth outcomes.",0bfd0244-8558-4f6e-b8a2-2c32019f85c5
23,methods23," Although our study did not support that maternal adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern may mitigate exposure, it is possible that other dietary patterns may in fact help mitigate the association between elevated prenatal cadmium exposure and lower birth weights. Future research should focus on finding dietary patterns that can mitigate prenatal cadmium risk and that can be easily translatable into public health recommendations.
