0,methods0," The Materials and Methods are summarized in Figure 1.  A cross-sectional study was conducted. Participants were recruited from the HS Clinic of Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain, and the Spanish Hidradenitis Suppurativa patients’ association (association (ASENDHI)). Patients who did not sign the written consent form had a condition that made it difficult to understand the questionnaires or were ≤18 years old were excluded from the study.  The main variables were the adherence to the MD and the physical activity. The adherence to the MD was assessed by the validated PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)) questionnaire. It consisted of 14 items about the frequency of consumption of different foods commonly eaten in the Mediterranean diet. Each item scored 1 or 0. The scores ≤ 5 suggest the lowest adherence; scores from 6–9, the average adherence and the scores ≥ 10, the highest adherence [23].",cb72dcf3-bc24-479f-8365-c997af01ccf0
1,methods1," Information about physical activity was collected using the short form of the International Physical Activity questionnaire [24] validated in the Spanish population [25]. It consisted of a 5-item questionnaire about the frequency, duration and intensity (vigorous and moderate) of physical activity in the last 7 days, as well as the walking and sitting times on a weekday [25]. According to their level of physical activity, the participants were classified into three groups: vigorous, moderate or slow [24].  The clinical, socio-demographic and biometric variables were recorded by means of a clinical interview and physical examination (patients from the HS clinic), or by an online self-administered questionnaire developed with Google® Forms suite (patients from ASHENDI). The socio-demographic characteristics included sex, age, civil status, height, weight, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and smoking habit.",92119c34-bf0a-431a-a619-bde39da05348
2,methods2," The clinical features included disease duration, Hurley stage, number of affected areas, nodules, abscesses and draining tunnels count, and previous and current treatments. The Hurley stage [26] and the International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4) were used to assess disease severity. The Hurley stage was self-reported by the patients [27,28]. The IHS4 score was calculated in patients who attended the HS clinic by the number of nodules (multiplied by 1), plus the number of abscesses (multiplied by 2), plus the number of draining tunnels (multiplied by 4), considering IHS4 < 4 mild inflammation, 5–10 moderate inflammation and >10 severe inflammation [29]. Self-reported disease activity was assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)), with 0 representing inactive disease and 10 the highest disease activity ever experienced [27,30,31].",b4dcb2b3-f4c2-4ae5-a4d4-15d5034ba8c4
3,methods3," These scales show the subjective impact of the disease on patients, with equal or greater importance than the objective scales [32,33].  Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the characteristics of the sample. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to check the normality of the variables. Continuous data was expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) or as the median (25th–75th percentile) and qualitative variables as the absolute (relative) frequency. The χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test were used to compare the qualitative data, as appropriate. The Wilcoxon test or the Student’s t-test for independent or paired samples were used to compare continuous data where necessary. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to independently assess the potential effect of MD on disease severity. Epidemiological and statistical criteria were used to model the variable selection. Significance was set for all tests at two tails, p < 0.05.",878ac510-728f-4914-ab24-d4383f1a5c9a
4,methods4," Statistical analyses were performed using JMP version 14.1.0 (SAS institute, Charlotte, NC, USA).  3. Results  3.1. Sociodemographic and Clinical Features of the Sample  A total of 221 patients were included in the study: 74.2% (174/221) were recruited from association (ASENDHI) and 21.3% (47/221) from our HS clinic. There were no differences in the sex, age, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), smoking habit, adherence to an MD, self-reported Hurley stage or disease duration between the two groups. A higher proportion of patients from the HS clinic were under biologic treatment, 42.11% (24/57) vs. 26.22% (43/164) p < 0.001, and presented a lower self-reported disease severity, 4.28 (2.89) vs. 5.94 (2.64), p < 0.001. The two populations were considered together for analyses.  The socio-demographic characteristics of the sample are shown in Table 1. Participants were more frequently smokers and overweighted-obesity women around 40 years of age.",16395da5-6cbb-46f1-ba56-fd7fda1e11b4
5,methods5," Regarding the clinical features, most patients self-reported Hurley II and III with a disease duration longer than 15 years. More than half of the patients had received systemic treatment, and a third of them had been treated with biologic drugs.  3.2. Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet  Data from the Predimed survey (Table 2) showed that the mean adherence to an MD was 7.41 (2.16). The highest proportion of affirmative answers was found in the use of extra virgin olive oil as the main culinary lipid (86.87%, 192/221) and the lowest proportion of affirmative answers was observed in glasses of wine consumption at ≥7/week (7.69%, 17/221). Most patients presented an average adherence to the MD of 66.51% (147/221), compared to a low adherence of 17.19% (38/221) and high adherence of 16.29% (36/221).  The factors potentially associated with a higher adherence to an MD were explored (Table 3).",2d93c8d7-d31a-4d78-948b-8cbc35f6be8e
6,methods6," The univariate analysis showed that being older, a lower symptom intensity, a lower self-reported Hurley and a higher intensity of physical activity were associated with a higher adherence to an MD. After conducting a multivariate regression model, it was observed that a lower self-reported disease activity, lower self-reported Hurley and higher level of physical activity were independently associated with a higher adherence to the MD.  In a second stage, the items of the Predimed questionnaire potentially associated with lower self-reported disease activity were explored. The use of extra virgin olive oil as the main culinary lipid and poultry rather than red meat consumption were the dietary habits that implied a lower degree of disease activity, p < 0.05.  The relationship between the adherence to the MD and disease severity assessed by IHS4 was also evaluated (only in patients of the HS clinic). A higher adherence to the MD was related to lower IHS4 (β = −0.10, p < 0.",e2522a27-d1d9-4509-b93a-095af43045c5
7,methods7,"001), Figure 2. This association remained stable after conducting a multivariate regression model adjusted by age, self-reported Hurley, disease duration and physical activity level (β = −0.04, p = 0.03).  3.3. Physical Activity  Regarding the physical activity, both the self-reported disease activity (p = 0.14, Figure 3) and IHS4 (p = 0.27, Figure 4) presented a trend towards an inverse association with the intensity of the activity regardless of an adherence to an MD.  4. Discussion  Inflammation plays a key role in HS pathogenesis. There are several factors that impact HS onset and evolution, including obesity, and consequently diet and physical activity [2]. This study shows that the MD may modify HS severity. Virgin olive oil could be the most important food related to lower HS severity. Physical activity levels may also be related to healthier lifestyles and, as a consequence, with a higher adherence to the MD, and they also play an anti-inflammatory role.",2f346886-26bc-4511-b599-c1f1c1062915
8,methods8,"  To date, there is only one previous study assessing the relationship between the MD and HS [17]. It observed that 41 HS patients had a lower adherence to the MD than 41 healthy controls [17]. It did not provide the mean adherence to MD in its population. In our study, the mean adherence to the MD was 7.41, reflecting an average adherence in line with the data of a healthy Spanish population [34], and the patients with moderate to severe psoriasis [35].  Regarding disease severity, Barrea et al. found that adherence to the MD negatively correlated to HS severity, evaluated by Sartoriusscore [17]. In agreement with them, we observed that the adherence to the MD is negatively associated with the IHS4 score and self-reported disease activity [29,36]. Adherence to the MD has been also associated with disease severity in psoriasis [20,34]. MD could lower systemic inflammation by different pathways.",31cd77f8-1c2d-4b59-a9ff-1f57711aa699
9,methods9," On the one hand, it has been postulated that diet can alter the gut microbiome, modulating the inflammatory response and potentially changing HS activity [10,37]. On the other hand, another possible explanation for the MD being related to lower disease severity is the reduction of chronic, systemic inflammation due to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of dietary fibers and polyphenols, and the low amount of low-refined carbohydrates. Carbohydrates increase insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, which activate FOXO1 and the mTORC1. This induces cellular proliferation in the follicular epithelium and sebaceous glands and predisposes them to follicular occlusion [10,38,39]. The anti-inflammatory power of the MD can be also due to lower amounts of simple carbohydrates, total fat, food with a higher n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio and higher complex carbohydrates, MUFA, n-3 PUFA and fiber [17].",edee092d-3843-49df-89b3-3f0d3d9edbfb
10,methods10," Moreover, it has been reported that nutrition impacts immune system regulation, so diet could also play a role in lymphocyte regulation [40].  Furthermore, this study shows that vigorous physical activity is related to a higher adherence to a MD, with a trend towards lower disease activity. Previously, it has been also observed in a healthy population that the adherence to the MD is positively related to the level of physical activity [34], as both are healthy lifestyle choices and impact on weight loss. Obesity increases insulin resistance (IR), with consequent chronic hyperglycemia [41], and increased inflammatory markers and disease flares [7]. Weight reduction could help to decrease friction in the intertriginous areas and reduce insulin resistance, improving disease severity with a synergic effect in addition to the diet [41]. In fact, it has been observed that weight reduction can improve HS, mainly by decreasing lesions in the frictional areas [42,43].",d5adf748-1c3d-4e72-a8cc-92ef6e3d572d
11,methods11," In this way, lifestyle modifications, including diet and physical activity, might change the disease evolution. Moreover, diet and physical activity may impact treatment response to TNF inhibitor therapy [44].  PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea), a multicenter Spanish clinical trial, carried out on a Spanish population, observed that MD supplemented with extra virgin olive oil or mixed nuts decreased the risk of developing cardiovascular events compared to dietary fat reduction only [45]. Moreover, the clinical trial PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus found that a one-year lifestyle combination of physical activity and a calorie-restricted MD improved cardiovascular risk factors, including waist circumference, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol, and reduced insulin resistance, improving glycemic control and insulin sensitivity.",5c1183c5-827f-40bf-b035-2bcdb3f82d5f
12,methods12," Smoking habits, obesity, metabolic syndrome, dyskinesia, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are cardiovascular risk factors frequently present in HS patients [1,46], which increase the prevalence of cardiovascular events in these patients [47]. Therefore, dietary and physical activity recommendations could decrease the risk of cardiovascular events in HS patients.  The results of this study should be interpreted considering some limitations: (1) its cross-sectional design, which hinders causal inferences, and (2) the inclusion of patients from two different populations, which increases sample representativeness but may incur differential selection bias. Nevertheless, a comparison of the baseline characteristics between the two populations did not show differences beyond those inherent to the treatment expected between the patients coming from a specialized unit and a patient advocacy group.  5.",90799023-82ca-4cc5-8d73-af98a2791460
13,methods13," Conclusions  In conclusion, this study shows that dietary patterns may impact the inflammatory severity of HS. A greater adherence to a MD, especially the use of olive oil as the main fat for cooking/eating could be related to lower HS severity. Physical activity on its own and in combination with an MD is probably also associated with additional benefits for HS patients. Dietary and physical recommendations should be encouraged in the therapeutic strategy of patients with HS, with the MD being one of the potential advisable dietary patterns. It would be interesting to develop clinical trials using different types of healthy dietary patterns and different types and grades of physical activity to recommend the most appropriate diet and exercise for HS patients.
