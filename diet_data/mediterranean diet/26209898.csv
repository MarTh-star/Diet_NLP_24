0,methods0,"4.1. Subjects We analyzed 1007 participants (368 men and 639 women) in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) (PREvención with DIeta MEDiterránea) trial recruited in the Valencia field center for whom DNA was available, the pre-miR-27a determined and valid data on alcohol intake obtained (See Flowchart in Figure S1). The PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) is a multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial (controlled-trials.com number, ISRCTN35739639; ethics approval by the Institutional Review Board of the Hospital Clinic at Barcelona, Spain, 16/07/2002, under the protocol number “G03/140”) aimed at assessing the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [37]. The PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Valencia field center, located on the East Mediterranean coast of Spain, was the field center that recruited the highest number of PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) participants (n = 1094).",2a35f5fb-7794-4533-8e9b-a393656830fd
1,methods1," Genotyping of the pre-miR-27a rs895819 polymorphism was carried out on 1042 participants with high quality DNA available. The 1007 participants with successful genotyping and alcohol data included in this analysis did not differ in the main characteristics from those of the total PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Valencia cohort. PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) eligible subjects were community-dwelling people (55–80 years of age for men; 60–80 years of age for women) who fulfilled at least one of two criteria: type 2 diabetes; 3 or more cardiovascular risk factors: current smoking, hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg or treatment with antihypertensive drugs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥160 mg/dL (or treatment with hypolipidemic drugs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ≤40 mg/dL, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) ≥25 kg/m2 or a family history of premature cardiovascular diseases.",2d2c2037-23a7-4e43-ae29-e90c0ff459f8
2,methods2," Exclusion criteria included a personal history of cardiovascular disease, any severe chronic illness and drug or alcohol addiction [54]. For exclusion, in addition to the medical records known by the doctors, all of the participants were given the CAGE questionnaire (which is an acronym of its four questions: Cutting down, Annoyance by criticism, Guilty feeling, and Eye-openers) [37] on possible alcohol addiction. Out of the 4 questions in the questionnaire, a positive response to 2 was the reason for exclusion in accordance with the protocol for that questionnaire. None of the patients included in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)-Valencia study had a positive response to 2 or more items in the CAGE questionnaire. The Institutional Review Board of the Valencia University (protocol number “G03/140”, 22 May 2003) approved the study protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent. In this report, we present data of the cross-sectional analysis at baseline.",fa62586f-dc46-4fbe-8ad7-af30f6bc3881
3,methods3,"  4.2. Demographic, Clinical, Anthropometric, Dietary and Other Lifestyles Measurements The baseline examination included the assessment of standard cardiovascular risk factors, medication use, socio-demographic factors and lifestyle variables, by validated questionnaires previously detailed [37]. These variables, as well as anthropometric variables, were used as covariates to adjust for potential confounding in the multivariate regression models. Weight and height were measured with light clothing and no shoes with calibrated scales and a wall-mounted stadiometer, respectively. body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight (in kg) divided by the height (in m2). Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 and in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO, Geneva, Switzerland) criteria.",a7ec7548-34ba-427c-b0e2-8bfe8421495f
4,methods4," Blood pressure was measured by trained personnel using a validated semi-automatic oscillometer (Omron HEM-70CP; Hoofddrop, The Netherlands) with the subject seated as previously reported [37].  The level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was measured by a validated 14-item questionnaire, and subjects were classified as having low or high adherence, based on the population mean (9 points) [55]. Food consumption was determined by a validated 137-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) [39]. This food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), which also included nine questions on consumption of different alcoholic beverages (different types of wine, beer and spirits), was used to measure the intake of beverages with alcohol. In this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), both for foods and drinks, there were questions about the average intake for each item over the previous year, including the baseline visit, which is when that questionnaire was administered.",bffa02bb-06d8-4784-855c-792b75e02e8f
5,methods5," For each alcoholic beverage included in the questionnaire (vintage red wine, young red wine, young rosé, white wine, cava, beers and spirits, including whisky, gin, rum, vodka and liqueurs), questions were asked for a typical Spanish measure of the same (as detailed in our previous publication [39]). Alcohol intake (g/day) was calculated by multiplying the amount of the beverage (mL) by the respective degree (% alcohol) and the constant 0.80 to transform alcohol volumes into weight. The sum of all of that is the total amount of alcohol in g/day consumed for each person. Abstainers were those individuals for whom the sum was zero grams per day. For the analysis of specific beverages, total wine, total beer and total spirits were considered as grouped variables. Further, red wine (including vintage red wine, young red wine and young rosé) and white wine were also analyzed.",632b5bd2-0522-40ad-8f51-448f568e7f06
6,methods6,  This food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was previously validated by us [39] in a similar population through a standard validation procedure in the following way: The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was administered twice (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)1 and food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)2) to explore reproducibility at 1 year. Four 3-d dietary records (DR) were used as a reference to explore validity; participants therefore recorded their food intake over 12 days in the course of 1 year. The intra-class correlation coefficient between alcohol intake from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and repeated DR was 0.82 [39].,da208ae3-cdc6-4d45-947b-ce0ae8302709
7,methods7," This high correlation coefficient value allows us to conclude that the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) measurements have good reproducibility and a relative validity similar to those of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s used in other prospective studies and that we, therefore, have a good instrument for measuring habitual alcohol and alcoholic beverage intake.  Once the amount of alcohol consumed was calculated (in g/day as the annual average) for each individual on the basis of the type and amount of alcoholic beverages consumed, we undertook an additional classification into alcohol intake categories. Although there are several cut-off points to classify alcohol intake, we used international criteria of alcohol intake [40,41,42], as we did in previous studies [42,43], with the aim of ensuring the best comparability between publications.",4c8cdb72-2f09-49ef-bfbf-a7e3016511aa
8,methods8," Thus, three groups of alcohol consumption were defined according to the reported daily intake of alcohol: no intake (0 g/day), moderate intake (≤26.4 g/day for men and ≤13.2 g/day for women) and high intake (>26.4 g/day for men and >13.2 g/day for women). These gram amounts correspond to 1 drink/day for women and 2 drinks/day for men [41,42,43]. The cut-off points were chosen to facilitate the interpretation of the gram-based alcohol categories and according to recommended upper limits of daily alcohol consumption of one drink/day for women and two drinks/day for men stated by the several organizations and frequently used in epidemiological studies on alcohol intake [41,42,43,44,45].  Physical activity was estimated by the validated Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity questionnaire, as previously reported [37].  4.3. Biochemical Determinations, DNA Extraction and Genotyping Fasting blood samples were obtained for each participant and stored at −80 °C until biochemical analyses.",ea859d16-546b-4c05-b181-d0cf3494a7db
9,methods9," Fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C and LDL-C were determined as previously reported [56]. In a random sample of participants (detailed in Table S1), liver enzymes and mean corpuscular volume were also determined at baseline by standard procedures. LDL-C concentrations were estimated with the equation of Friedewald et al. whenever triglycerides were <400 mg/dL. Genomic DNA was extracted from buffy coat with the MagNaPure LC DNA Isolation kit (ROCHE Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The pre-miR-27a rs895819 A>G polymorphism was genotyped using the HumanOmniExpress Illumina BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) by standard techniques. Genotype frequencies were consistent with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (p = 0.111).  4.4. Statistical Analyses Chi-square tests were used to compare proportions. Triglyceride concentrations were log-transformed for the statistical analyses. Alcohol intake was square root transformed for the statistical analyses.",51b400fd-0cb9-4e8c-b6ba-439be062d970
10,methods10," In both cases, untransformed values were presented for means and standard error, but the p-values were obtained with the square root-transformed variables. ANOVA tests were applied to compare crude means according to the pre-miR-27a rs895819 genotypes. Co-dominant and recessive models of inheritance were first tested to know the effects of the variant allele. In the analysis for the additive model, the pre-miR-27a rs895819 A>G polymorphism was considered as a linear term coded as 0, 1 or 2 depending on the number of G-alleles, with the homozygote wild-type coded as 0. Taking into account that similar effects were detected in AA and AG subjects, a recessive model GG versus (AA + AG) was also considered. Results were presented both for the co-dominant/additive and for the recessive models for the whole population.",4b65e437-d3b6-4160-8b96-91c78547f466
11,methods11," In addition, a stratified analysis of total alcohol intake in male drinkers, men (drinkers and non-drinkers) and women (drinkers and non-drinkers) according to the pre-miR-27a rs895819 polymorphism was undertaken.  Unadjusted (crude) and multivariable adjusted general linear models (general linear model (GLM)) were used for continuous variables, and logistic regression models were used for dichotomous variables (categories of alcohol consumption). Models were adjusted for potential confounders including age, sex, type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, physical activity, smoking and total energy intake. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the risk of being in the category of high alcohol consumption were estimated, and a multivariable logistic regression was performed. Analyses were done for the whole population and stratified by sex when indicated.",77785761-c6b0-41a2-99dd-ae601129db05
12,methods12," A sensitivity analysis to test the homogeneity of the pre-miR-27a rs895819 polymorphism (as recessive) with the risk of having a high drinking pattern was carried out taking into account the following categories: sex, obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and adherence to Mediterranean Diet. Interaction terms between the pre-miR-27a rs895819 polymorphism (recessive) and the corresponding variables for stratification were calculated in the corresponding hierarchical regression model (logistic). The stratified estimations of the associations were also carried out with the multivariate adjusted regression models. Statistical analyses were performed with the IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). All tests were two-tailed, and p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.  5.",8c42e7d2-1113-4a12-8f7e-efe8588ce4de
13,methods13," Conclusions In conclusion, in this study, we have reported, for the very first time, a significant association between an SNP in a miRNA (rs895819 A>G in the pre-miR27a) and total alcohol consumption (higher in homozygous subjects for the variant G-allele) and specific beverages, so providing more information on the importance of miRNAs in regulating alcohol intake, not only through epigenetic mechanisms, but also through the genetic variants in their DNA sequence, which has to be taken into account in later omic integration studies analyzing the miRNAs’ regulome. The generalization of the association of the pre-miR-27a rs895819 polymorphism with alcohol intake in different populations from the one studied needs to be established in future studies.
