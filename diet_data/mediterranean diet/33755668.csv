0,background0, The aim of the current investigation was to explore the association of food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP)) with the maternal diet during pregnancy and breastfeeding in Greek infants. ,799915e8-3dd3-4f20-abd5-78d7d6950ead
1,methods0," Patients  For this retrospective, observational, multicenter, case-control study, conducted between May 2018 to November 2020, mothers of breastfed infants with a history of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) were recruited from 6 regions in Greece including Athens, Thessaloniki, Amaliada, Volos, Kavala, and Kozani (food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) group). A control population was selected of mothers of breastfed infants with no history of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), matched for age, sex, and place of residence [healthy control (HC) group]. The study was approved by the Hospital Ethics and Scientific Committee of the Amaliada General Hospital of Ilia and the Medical Association of Thessaloniki on behalf of all study centers (Study IDs: 53/2021 and 4170/2018), and conducted in accordance with the code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki).",8800f9e7-4f27-4205-b5c3-cae9cb5ccc5f
2,methods1," All participants were fully informed of the scope and procedures of the study and provided written consent.  Clinical Data  The diagnosis of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) was based on the history of scant bright red rectal bleeding with mucus in an otherwise healthy infant, which disappeared after a two-week maternal elimination diet and reoccurred after reintroduction of the culprit food. Infections and other causes of rectal bleeding, such as intussusception, volvulus, Hirschsprung's disease, and necrotizing enterocolitis, were excluded. We recorded the symptoms, the infant's age at onset and development of tolerance, physical examination findings, stool examination results, allergenic food(s) implicated in food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), other allergies, and family history of atopy or asthma.",93261d84-0b7d-44e3-a446-9d4fc7088a75
3,methods2,"  Food Frequency Questionnaires  Information on maternal diet during pregnancy and breastfeeding was collected by a personal interview with a qualified dietician, using the following questionnaires:  a) The Mediterranean Diet Score Questionnaire, which estimates adherence to the MedDiet, recording consumption of the 11 main components (non-refined cereals, fruit, vegetables, potatoes, legumes, olive oil, fish, red meat, poultry, full-fat dairy products, and alcohol). The resultant MedDiet score is categorized: 0–13: no adherence; 14–27: insufficient; 28–41: satisfactory; 42–55: very good adherence (13).",8343411e-d4fc-4888-8ea3-c75e51acea7b
4,methods3,"  b) The Mediterranean Oriented Culture Specific Semi-Quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire, which includes 221 foods, subdivided into 22 food sections: (1) white grain products, including rice and potato; (2) whole wheat grain products; (3) breads/pastries; (4) stews; (5) pulses; (6) raw and cooked vegetable salads; (7) fruit and homemade juices; (8) nuts; (9) milk/dairy products; (10) meat/traditional meat dishes; (11) red meat products; (12) white meat products; (13) eggs; (14) fish/seafood; (15) fats/spreads (including olive oil); (16) traditional dips/sauces/dressings; (17) sugar/sweet preserves/confectionary; (18) “ready-to-eat” foods; (19) chips/salty puffed snacks; (20) herbals/teas; (21) soft drinks/nonalcoholic beverages; (22) alcoholic drinks. Four additional questions concern (23) addition of extra salt, (24) use of non-stick casseroles/grilled food, and (25) traditionally cooked Mediterranean homemade food; (26) food supplements.",662ed43e-993d-415f-b637-cad8e17f1f3f
5,methods4,"  Food consumption frequency is scored as follows: (1) never or less than once per month, (2) 1–3 times per month, (3) once per week, (4) 2–4 times per week, (5) 5–6 times per week, (6) once per day, (7) 2–3 times per day, (8) 4–5 times per day, and (9) 6 or more times per day (14).  Statistical Analysis  The data were shown as mean (±SD) or median and IQR. Statistical analysis included inferential analysis, statistical tests, and modeling, using R software (version 4.04) and R studio (version 1.4.1106) (Boston, USA). The normality of the distribution of continuous variables was checked using Shapiro-Wilk's test. Comparisons between the food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) and HC groups were made by t-test (normal distribution) and Wilcoxon test (non-normal distribution). P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",82a9d55e-7727-49dc-9760-2cf66a500193
6,methods5," To investigate the food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) risk in relation to the maternal diet during pregnancy and breastfeeding, the elastic net regression model was applied, which combines Lasso and Ridge regression (15), using the glmnet package in R (version 4.1-1).

7,results0," The study included 96 mothers and their breastfed infants with the diagnosis of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) made by a pediatric allergist (food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) group), and 141 mothers with healthy breastfed infants (HC group). The mean age of the food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) infants (48 boys, 50%) was 18 ± 12.14 months and that of the HC infants (62 boys, 44%) 18.7 ± 12.8 months. The birth weight showed no significant difference between groups. The mean current height in HC infants (86.09 ± 12.31 cm) was lower than that in food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) infants (93.83 ± 9.5 cm) (p < 0.01) (Table A in Appendix).  The median age at diagnosis and resolution of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) was 2 months (IQR 1–3 months) and 12 months (IQR 11–14 months), respectively. The symptoms were the following: blood in feces (80.1%) and mucus in feces (79%); 2.",789089e6-f254-4658-8db9-b8da3f35f9c6
8,results1,"7% presented anemia and 0.9% presented hypoalbuminemia. The symptoms were induced by maternal consumption of cow's milk (83.6%), egg (7.3%), wheat (6.4%), and beef (6.4%), and by lamb, peanut, rice, pear, grape, and fish (1% each) (Table B in Appendix). After diagnosis, the mothers continued breastfeeding, following an elimination diet for the offending food until food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) was resolved.  Other Allergies in the Infants  Table 1 presents the allergy history of the study infants. Among the 96 infants with a history of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), at the age of data collection, 83 self-report reactions to foods including cow's milk at 59%, egg at 8%, wheat at 4%, peanut at 1%, soya at 1%, beef at 5.2%, lamb at 1%, apple at 1%, and the carrot at 1%. Wheezing was present in 8.3%, while the other 22% had eczema. In contrast, of the 141 infants in the HC group, only two had FA (one to milk and one to apple), one (0.",8b2202ee-505a-41cf-80a7-f785e46560d1
9,results3," The food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) families were more frequently urban residents (85 vs. 79%). A higher parental educational level was significantly less common in the food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) group (mothers 27% and fathers 24.5%) than in the HC group (mothers 62% and fathers 59%). Maternal smoking was more frequent in the food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) group (14 vs. 7.8%), and 13% of fathers in both groups were smokers (Figure 1A).  Figure 1 Family demographic characteristics and allergy history: (A) mother; (B) father.  Infants with food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) more often had a family history of allergy/atopy; 20% of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) mothers had documented allergy/atopy (17% FA, 1% asthma, and 1% allergic rhinitis), compared with 2.8% of HC mothers who reported FA.",cbd56d15-796f-48eb-b4ef-5d72cc25a1cf
10,results4," food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) fathers also had a higher rate of reported allergy/atopy, specifically FA (25%), asthma (5.4%), and eczema (14.5), than HC fathers (FA in 2.7% and 0% asthma and eczema)) (Figure 1B).  Regarding siblings, 69/96 food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) infants and 37/141 of the HC infants were the only children in the family. Among the infants with siblings, in the food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) group (27 infants with 41 siblings), a documented FA in a sibling was reported in 58.5% (12/41 milk, 7/41 egg, 3/41 fish, 4/41 shellfish, 2/41 wheat, 2/41 peanut, 2 hazelnuts, 2/41 walnut, 2/41 pepper allergy), and 15/41 had asthma, 12/41 eczema, and two (4.8%) had a history of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP).

Maternal Dietary Habits  Mediterranean Diet  Overall, the study mothers showed satisfactory adherence to the MedDiet, similar in the two groups (MedDiet score: food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) 33.87 vs. HC 33.38, p = 0.38). No differences in the total MedDiet score were observed among women living in the different Greek regions. No significant dietary changes were found between pregnancy and breastfeeding. Significant differences in the consumption of vegetables and olive oil were recorded between the food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) and the HC mothers in both study periods: for vegetables 2.19 ± 0.91 vs. 1.85 ± 0.99 in pregnancy, p = 0.008, and during breastfeeding 2.1 ± 0.89 vs. 1.8 ± 0.95, p = scores of 0.018; for olive oil 4.78 ± 0.64 vs. 4.56 ± 0.79 in pregnancy, p = 0.",5d09684f-7b29-4480-a36a-79166d7eef3b
12,results7,"05	  During pregnancy, food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) mothers consumed less fish and shellfish (p = 0.003) and more vegetables (p = 0.02), than HC mothers, and they used less food supplements, specifically folic acid (p = 0.01), multivitamins (p < 0.01), and omega-3 (p = 0.04).  During breastfeeding the food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) mothers consumed significantly more vegetables than during pregnancy (p = 0.05), while vegetables' consumption was not altered by the HC mothers in the two study periods (p > 0.05).  Prediction Models of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) Risk According to Maternal Diet During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding  Elastic net regression was used to construct multifactorial models to explore the effect of maternal dietary factors on food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) risk. The pregnancy model presented high statistical significance (p < 0.01) and good accuracy (accuracy = 0.",cb043d3a-e04e-4d63-9e2b-ec550dfc00f5
13,results8,"83), with an area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)) of 0.87, confirming the ability of the model to distinguish maternal dietary factors affecting food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP). According to this model, pregnancy factors associated with food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) diagnosis were n-3 and vitamin C supplements, sugary products, vegetables, total fat, and the use of non-stick kitchenware and grills. Protective factors were traditionally cooked homemade food, dairy products, nuts, whole grain products, fish and shellfish, fruits, multivitamins, vitamin A, vitamin D, B-complex and folic acid, and dietary fiber (Figure 2A).  Figure 2 Maternal dietary factors that are associated with increased food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP)) risk or protection, as predicted with the Elastic Net Regression model during pregnancy.",82a3c44b-8ba1-4566-bf5e-b6239fe0b0cd

The breastfeeding model did not reveal statistical significance (p = 0.08). However, there was a trend towards a non significant association of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) cases with increased consumption of dietary fiber, total fat, vegetables, sugar/sugary products and soft drinks, white flour products, and salt, whereas no significant protective factors included increased intake of fruits, fish and shellfish products, whole grain products, homemade food, vitamin D, and multivitamin supplementation (Figure 2B).

15,discussion0," This retrospective, observational, multicenter case-control study, the first to explore the risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) in relation to maternal dietary habits during pregnancy and lactation, provided evidence that the traditional MedDiet can be protective against food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), when whole wheat products, fish, and fruit are consumed frequently by the mother, using traditional cooking methods. A high intake of fat, sugar, and vegetables increases the risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), together with the use of grills and non-stick kitchenware. As in other allergies, the inclusion of common food allergens in the maternal diet appears to protect infants from food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP).",e02f4359-3f5d-4f3e-add1-3a2d4e53cc21
16,discussion1,"  Current evidence does not support maternal dietary restrictions during pregnancy or lactation for prevention of allergic disease in the offspring (10, 16); consumption of allergenic foods in pregnancy (17) and during lactation is reported to prevent allergic sensitization to these foods (17, 18), and in line with this, frequent consumption of common allergenic foods (dairy products, nuts, whole-grain foods, and fish/shellfish) as part of a balanced diet, was associated with a reduction in the risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) (17, 19, 20).  Earlier studies suggest that the MedDiet is associated with reduced allergic outcomes (21), and a systematic review confirmed the beneficial effect of the MedDiet during pregnancy and lactation (12). In the current study, both groups of mothers recorded similar satisfactory adherence to the MedDiet, thus allowing the study of the impact of specific foods within this dietary pattern.",d8107a8d-42f8-4628-b200-d49db37f7818
17,discussion2," Home-cooked food, exemplifying Mediterranean dietary habits, appeared to be associated with a protective effect. The apparent beneficial effect of specific components of MedDiet and/or traditional cooking methods in the protection against allergies has generated interest in a proposal for a large prospective randomized controlled trial (randomized controlled trial (RCT)) during pregnancy to assess its effect on infant allergy prevention (22, 23).  Conversely, a high-fat diet and the use of non-stick kitchenware and grills were associated with food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP). The consumption of olive oil did not appear as a significant individual factor as it did not differ between our study groups, but the total fat intake was a risk factor for food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP). Results from a mouse model suggest that a high-fat diet increases the risk of FA due to microbiome alterations (24).",72290bc1-7b82-4ed2-86b0-7979d4a2f485
18,discussion3," Grilling food, mainly meat, at home may affect the fetal immune system, and probably aggravate the risk of food allergies in neonates and children, via the carcinogenic compounds produced at high temperatures (25).  Sugary products and soft drinks were associated with an increase in the risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) in our population, in agreement with a recent metanalysis of high sugar consumption during pregnancy and lactation and allergies in the offspring (26). Moreover, high salt intake during lactation appeared to increase the risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP). Documentation is lacking about the effect of salt intake during pregnancy and lactation on infant allergy risk.",26292a13-3edc-42d9-b36b-0aa093f9853d
19,discussion4,"  Whole grain products were associated with a reduced risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) in both periods, but white flour consumption during breastfeeding was associated with an increase in the risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP). Dietary fiber supplementation during pregnancy appeared to exert a beneficial effect. Dietary fiber acts as a prebiotic, ensuring gut microbial biodiversity during pregnancy. The microbiome is transferred from mother to offspring. Loss of microbial communities or species occurs in the mother-infant dyad when the diet is rich in highly processed foods (27). Breast milk benefits the infant gut microbiome diversity, and formula-fed infants lack dominant microbes; formula enriched with symbiotics have not increased gut biodiversity or provided protection in high-risk infants (28–30).",76f60d9f-19a0-4472-8c6c-b30bf4772c17
20,discussion5," Increased insoluble dietary fiber intake during pregnancy is associated specifically with reduced risk of wheeze and increased risk of eczema in the infant (31). Conversely, maternal fiber supplementation during lactation was associated with an increase in the risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP).  An unexpected finding was the link of vegetable intake with food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP). Other studies associated maternal vegetable intake with allergy prevention (25, 32), although offspring of women with a higher intake of total vegetables, folate-rich, and green and yellow vegetables were reported to have a higher risk of allergies, including FA (33). In countries where the MedDiet is widespread, vegetables are frequently incriminated in FA (34–36).",ce5653d2-c22f-44d4-a0ca-c5206f9e0568
21,discussion6," In Greece, pregnant and lactating women are encouraged to consume washed and peeled fruits without restrictions, but they are often advised to consume only specific vegetables during the following events: a) during pregnancy, to eat only cooked or boiled vegetables, for prevention of toxoplasmosis, transmitted through vegetables grown in soil contaminated with cat feces (37); b) during lactation, to prefer green leafy vegetables, but to avoid vegetables that may cause colic in the baby, such as broccoli (38). Cooking methods affect the antioxidant vitamins, with loss in vitamins C, E, β-carotene, and K (39), dietary fiber, and slight increases in insoluble dietary fiber (40).  A high intake of seasonal fruits during pregnancy and lactation, both fresh and dried, was associated with a reduced risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP).",0d27c8da-85c4-420f-8980-d39cfaa8805b
22,discussion7," The seasonal availability of a wide variety of Mediterranean fruits rich in antioxidants protects against oxidative exposures, abating allergy risk during pregnancy, lactation (12) infancy (41) and childhood (42, 43). The high fruit content of soluble dietary fibers enhances the development of a healthy intestinal microbiota (23), and fruit antioxidants, including polyphenols, carotenoids, and vitamins A and C, are anti-inflammatory (44). Vitamin C supplements increased the risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), and relevant data are conflicting, indicating low to no protection against allergies (21).  Several researchers report a protective effect of high fish and seafood intake in pregnancy and infancy against allergic diseases in childhood (45–47), and our study confirmed a reduced risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP).",6dbbf60b-9445-4421-be87-7c7a9087715f
23,discussion8," In our population, n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) supplementation was a risk factor for food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), and although n-3 PUFA supplementation has been suggested for allergy prevention (48), especially in lower socioeconomic populations (49) its benefits are obscure (50–52).  Multivitamin supplements, folic acid, vitamins A, D, and B-complex during pregnancy and vitamin D and multivitamin supplements during lactation were associated with a reduced risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), and other researchers have reported vitamin protection against allergy outcomes in the offspring, mainly in undernourished mothers, especially from vitamin A and folic acid, and also iron (53, 54).",ae3600a7-5950-4db0-8789-8b4504cab020
24,discussion9,"  Vitamin D supplementation, in both pregnancy and lactation, appeared to reduce the risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), and other researchers report that it protects against asthma and FA in the offspring (55, 56). Inadequate levels of vitamin D in infants have been associated with clinical manifestations of cow's milk allergy, including non-IgE forms (57), and the role of vitamin D in the prevention of FA (58) and other atopic disease is documented (55, 56, 59).  Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP)) is frequently, but not exclusively, caused by cow's milk protein, even in exclusively breastfed infants (3, 60, 61). In 83.6% of the cases proved by the challenge in this study, cow's milk was incriminated in food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP).",40605af7-f454-4022-8779-94ff7755a046
25,discussion10,"  A striking finding in our study was that approximately 25% of our food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) infants had parents with higher education compared with 60% of HC infants. In the Mediterranean area, parental tertiary education has been found associated with high consumption of fruits and vegetables, and low childhood asthma prevalence (62).  In line with other reports (63), the food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) infants more often had a family history of allergy and atopy than the HC infants. Infants with food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) are reported to develop IgE-mediated FA (64).  Children who are pre- and postnatally exposed to tobacco smoke have a significantly higher risk of FA (65), and in our study maternal smoking was associated with food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP).",80f409c1-8a2a-4449-b602-e1f03cbe2c4f
26,discussion11," Paternal smoking was equivalent in the two groups and had less effect, probably because fathers spend less time in close contact with the infants (66).  Our results support the need for increased counseling on maternal diet during pregnancy and breastfeeding, especially when there is a family history of allergy, in the context of the prevailing Mediterranean diet, as certain foods, nutrients, and cooking methods appear to be associated with food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP).  A limitation of the current investigation was the retrospective design, data based on self-reported questionnaires, and recall bias when they report their past eating habits during pregnancy and lactation. There is a need for a prospective, intervention study to investigate the apparent benefits of the specific components of the Mediterranean diet model for infant allergy prevention during pregnancy and lactation.",381412c4-0e6a-4add-ac83-ee73948e8927
27,discussion12,"  Conclusion  In this first cross-sectional, multicenter study on the association of maternal diet during pregnancy and breastfeeding with the development of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) in the offspring, we found that frequent consumption of common allergens, food home-cooked according to the traditional Mediterranean customs, wholewheat grains, fruits, fish and shellfish, and folic acid, vitamins D, A, B-complex, and multivitamin supplementation appeared to protect against food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) in infancy. Conversely, a diet with high content of fat, sugary products, salt, vegetables and dietary fiber, vitamin C and n-3 PUFA supplementation, and use of non-stick kitchenware/grills appeared to increase the risk of food protein induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP). A family history of allergy was a strong predisposing factor. These results show that elements of the MedDiet may be protective.",3afc066e-6bde-409a-bb86-12c89231ad7e
