0,introduction0,"The overall quality of a dietary pattern appears to affect adiposity and the risk of obesity to a greater extent than relative macronutrient quantity [1]–[3]. However, only some prospective studies have investigated the association of diet quality scores with obesity risk [1], [4]–[11]. Most of them found that an overall food pattern in line with the traditional Mediterranean diet was inversely associated with obesity risk or weight gain [1], [4], [6], [10]–[11]. This “Mediterranean” dietary pattern is typically based on whole or minimally processed foods and incorporates most of the protective factors (fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, dietary fiber, fish, vegetable protein and vegetable fat from olive oil) but few of the adverse dietary factors (fast food, sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grain products, energy density, and partially hydrogenated or trans-fat) for obesity [2].",a830035b-e895-419c-a3c3-30bcab8491ba
1,introduction1," The inverse association between the Mediterranean diet and adiposity indexes has been also reported in most [12]–[16], but not all [17], cross-sectional assessments. Some clinical trials have also added support to this association [18]–[20].  All these studies have mainly used full-length food frequency questionnaires (food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)) usually with >100 items, 24-hour recalls or other time-consuming methods, to evaluate the adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern. In contrast with these methods, a brief tool assessing only a small number of foods measured in servings/d or servings/wk might enable a dietitian to provide immediate feedback to participants and to establish negociated changes with them to improve their dietary quality, setting the goals in easily understandable units (food servings) [21]. The available studies in adults assessed body weight, weight changes or changes in body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) as measures of adiposity.",b6f19f25-20bc-44bd-9bd1-114c9be60bf6
2,introduction2," Nevertheless, it is well known that measures of abdominal obesity outperform body weight or body mass index (BMI) in predicting cardiovascular risk or diabetes [22]–[25]. Waist circumference (WC) has been most commonly used to assess abdominal obesity. However, WC does not take differences in height into account. It is very likely that subjects with a given WC will have more abdominal fat than taller subjects with the same WC. The use of the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) instead of WC overcomes this problem by taking height into account. The use of the WHtR is supported by a systematic review which assessed WHtR, WC, and body mass index (BMI) as predictors of diabetes or cardiovascular disease and found mean areas under receiving operator characteristic curves of 0.704, 0.693 and 0.671 for WHtR, WC and body mass index (BMI), respectively [23].",5938734b-5213-40d0-b971-8c81572e1aba
3,introduction3," A prior meta-analysis [24] and a study specifically examining this issue in Mediterranean subjects [25] also supported the predictive superiority of WHtR.  To our knowledge, with the exception of a Spanish study in children [15], no previous study in adults has assessed the association between the overall quality of a diet and WHtR. We assessed the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (as measured with a simple 14-item questionnaire [26]) and WHtR or other indexes of adiposity in all the participants at baseline of the participants in the “PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea” (PREDIMED) study, a large trial of nutritional intervention for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [27].

All data used in the present report were collected at the beginning of the trial and correspond, thus, only to the baseline evaluations.  Subjects Participants were women (60 to 80 years) or men (55 to 80 years) without prior cardiovascular disease, but at high cardiovascular risk because they had either type-2 diabetes mellitus or at least three major cardiovascular risk factors out of six candidate risk factors. These risk factors were: current smoking, hypertension, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, overweight/obesity, or family history of premature coronary heart disease. The specific cut-off points for these factors and the exclusion criteria have been previously described [27]. The methods for the dietary intervention of the participants in the “PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea” (PREDIMED) trial have been also published [21], [27].",8c05307f-aaaf-41cc-a484-9a62ffa624fa

With this first step, 9 of the 14 items were obtained [31]. Five additional items that were felt to be especially relevant to assess adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet were subsequently added. Two of these items used short questions to inquire on food habits: Do you use olive oil as the principal source of fat for cooking? and Do you prefer to eat chicken, turkey or rabbit instead of beef, pork, hamburgers or sausages? The other 3 items inquired on frequency of consumption of nuts, soda drinks and a typical Mediterranean sauce (“sofrito”): How many times do you consume nuts per week?

10,methods6," In addition, a full-length 137-item validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) [32] was also administered to all participants. We obtained information about total energy intake and alcohol intake (only with descriptive purposes) from this food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). In the validation study, the score obtained with brief 14-item questionnaire correlated significantly with that obtained from the full-length food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) score (Pearson correlation coefficient (r) = 0.52; intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.51). Associations in the anticipated directions for the different dietary intakes reported on the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) were found [26]. Significant inverse correlations of the 14-item tool with fasting glucose, total:HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides and the 10-y estimated coronary artery disease risk also supported the validity of this brief Mediterranean diet adherence screener [26].",12a2b399-68e1-4f3e-8f6c-bc468672e25f

Comparisons were done separately for women and men. We also calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between each of the three adiposity indexes and the 14-item score.

22,discussion0,"In this baseline assessment of 7,447 participants in the participants in the “PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea” (PREDIMED) primary prevention trial we found a robust and monotonic inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and indexes of abdominal obesity or general obesity. This is the first time that an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the WHtR has been reported in an adult population using an easily administrable brief tool to assess the overall quality of diet and its conformity to the traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern. Prior findings on the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and WC based on full-length dietary assessment methods are consistent with this finding [14], [20].",744c7d1d-1f00-4172-8f45-454ad04316f6
23,discussion1," The most interesting aspect of this study is that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was appraised using only a brief 14-item questionnaire which is less time-demanding, less expensive and requires less collaboration from participants than the usual full-length food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) or other more comprehensive methods. In addition, it provides the unique window of opportunity to provide feedback to the participant immediately after the questionnaire is completed. In fact, this 14-item tool is a key element in the intervention conducted in the participants in the “PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea” (PREDIMED) trial and has been previously validated against the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) used in the study [21], [26]. The present results reinforce the usefulness of the 14-point Mediterranean diet screener and its potential application in other settings.",ffcbfdab-8a20-4bf9-bd5a-f64c44274f9a
24,discussion2,"  Another contribution of the present work is the use of a novel index for central obesity (WHtR) which is easily measurable, can advantageously replace the use of body mass index (BMI) in the assessment of diet-adiposity relationships and may perform differently to body mass index (BMI).  Previously we had assessed the first 3204 trial participants and found that the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and obesity was lower in participants with higher values of the 14-item screener [35]. We have reported also that the 14-item score related directly to HDL-cholesterol and inversely to body mass index (BMI), WC, serum triglycerides, and fasting glucose among 7146 participants in the participants in the “PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea” (PREDIMED) trial [28]. In the present study we include all 7447 participants and have assessed in detail not only body mass index (BMI) and WC, but also the WHtR.",cedfa8cc-2fc1-41ee-b0b8-afbcaabdb591
25,discussion3," Importantly, we also report the specific association of each of the 14 individual items included in the Mediterranean diet score with indexes of obesity or abdominal obesity.  Our results suggest that closer adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower prevalence of obesity, and specifically, abdominal obesity. This is highly plausible because Mediterranean diets have been shown in rigorously controlled randomized trials [18]–[20], [36]–[37] to provide beneficial metabolic effects, including improvements in insulin sensitivity and reductions in biomarkers of low-grade inflammation [38]–[40]. The excellent nutritional adecuacy that can be obtained by following a Mediterranean diet [41] might add biological plausibility to an inverse association of this dietary pattern with abdominal and visceral adiposity.",74c04e86-11d4-448c-8fcc-32a3adf5ce03
26,discussion4," The appropriate harmony and balance in the intake of both macronutrients and essential micronutrients [42] may contribute to lower oxidative stress, less postprandial inflammation and reductions in other mechanisms associated with the abdominal deposition of fat [43], [44].  Our results are also consistent with previous epidemiologic studies showing a beneficial effect of the Mediterranean diet on the risk of the metabolic syndrome [36]. In addition to the observed stronger inverse association of the Mediterranean diet with the WHtR than with body mass index (BMI) or WC, when we individually assessed each of the 14 items included in the score, almost all of them were associated with a lower prevalence of abdominal obesity. The only exception was the food group that included butter, margarine, and cream. Participants consuming ≥1 serving/d were mainly margarine consumers. A borderline significant (p = 0.",e0af4b11-02ce-4be6-a080-779bb74afc8a
27,discussion5,"09) inverse association between margarine consumption (≥1 serving/d) and obesity risk was found. Currently, most margarine brands in Spain do not contain trans fatty acids –related to a higher risk of weight gain and abdominal obesity [45], [46]- and there are no reasons to expect that margarine consumption might be linked to a greater obesity risk.  The main limitation of this study relates to the cross-sectional nature of our analyses and the potentiality for reverse causality bias. However, the most likely direction of that potential bias would be towards finding a higher adherence to a healthier Mediterranean diet among overweight or obese subjects. This possibility perhaps might explain why a non-significant direct association was reported in a previous cross-sectional assessment [17].",d9ca3aaf-8a1a-40b9-b519-913b183a3c7f
28,discussion6," Indeed, is it highly plausible that subjects who perceive themselves as overweight/obese would be more likely to adopt favourable changes in their diets, because the perception of their excess weight would lead them to improve their dietary habits or to receive this advice from their caregivers. Therefore, given this potential bias, we would have expected a positive association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and adiposity indexes, because high-risk patients with overweight/obesity might be more likely to change their food habits as a consequence of their excess weight. Presently, in our setting, some physicians or dietitians would recommend a Mediterranean-type diet to overweight or obese patients. Consequently, the inverse association found in this assessment is unlikely to be due to reverse causation bias.",d2e38261-ad3d-44db-9687-860e0451aa6c
29,discussion7," Another potential limitation is the small absolute magnitude of observed differences in the adiposity indexes; also other factors that we did not collect, such as dieting before the trial could represent alternative explanations of our findings.  The final results of the participants in the “PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea” (PREDIMED) trial will include the prospective assessment of weight, WC and WHtR changes after an average follow-up of 5 years according to the randomized intervention with an intention to treat analysis. These results will be available in the near future and should provide a definitive confirmation of our findings.
