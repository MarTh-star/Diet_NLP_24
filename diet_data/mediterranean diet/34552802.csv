0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Participants  We performed a case-control study in six comprehensive hospitals from August 2014 to August 2016 in Xi’an City, Northwest China. These six hospitals were selected according to their qualification to perform the diagnoses of birth defects and their willingness to cooperate. The detailed fetal echocardiography during the 20th–24th month of gestation was in the routine prenatal screening program in the six hospitals, and used as the prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart defects (CHD). The study design has been published in detail previously [8,15]. Briefly, we recruited participants among the pregnant women waiting for delivery in the cooperated hospitals. Pregnant women whose fetuses had isolated congenital heart defects (CHD) and no genetic abnormalities were included in the case group, and pregnant women whose fetuses had no diagnosed congenital anomalies were included in the control group.",f938515b-7abb-4b29-8beb-3d89c9c0b9f7
1,methods1," Mothers with multiple gestations or diabetes were excluded because of potentially different etiologies. Qualified specialists in the ultrasound, obstetrics, and pediatrics departments strictly enforced the diagnostic standard criteria to finish the diagnoses in cases and controls. We further conducted a telephone follow-up within one year after birth to confirm the diagnosis. All the congenital heart defects (CHD) diagnoses were ascertained by echocardiography and/or cardiac catheterization and/or surgery. We randomly selected controls each month in each hospital, and the ratio of the number of controls to cases included in the same month in the same hospital was 2:1. To detect a significant (p < 0.05) OR of 0.75 between groups of good and poor dietary quality with a statistical power of 80%, 443 cases, and 886 controls would be required. Finally, 474 cases and 948 controls with completed questionnaires were included, meeting the requirements of the sample size.",52702a8f-1bca-4356-a925-9cc9ead8fbd2
2,methods2,"  All participants gave written informed consent. The ethics committee of Xi’an Jiaotong University Health Science Center approved this study (No. 2012008).  2.2. Dietary Quality Evaluation  We used a 111-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) to collect maternal diets throughout the entire pregnancy when women were waiting for delivery in the hospital. The median time from the end of the interview to delivery was two days among the cases and controls. Maternal dietary habits tend to be stable across pregnancy [27]; thus, maternal diets during the entire pregnancy are comparable with those in the 3rd–8th week of gestation, the critical period of cardiac development [6,8,15,28]. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was established according to a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) designed for pregnant women in Northwest China [29].",45f0040b-4cde-486a-9355-9240ae675424
3,methods3," Women recalled consumption frequency based on eight predefined categories ranging from never to two or more times per day and reported portion sizes with the help of food portion images [30,31]. The nutrient contents of foods were derived from the Chinese Food Composition Tables [32,33].  The Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were used to assess dietary quality because these priori-defined indices were previously validated and reflected common recommended dietary guidelines.",7280c8b5-d4da-4daf-b2a4-19475e296e86
4,methods4," The Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) consists of 16 healthy food groups (citrus fruits, deep orange fruits, other fruits, dark green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, deep orange vegetables, other vegetables, legumes, deep orange tubers, nuts and seeds, whole grains, liquid oils, fish and shellfish, poultry and game meat, low-fat dairy, and eggs), 7 unhealthy food groups (processed meat, refined grains, and baked goods, sweets and ice cream, sugar-sweetened beverages, juice, white roots and tubers, and purchased deep fried foods), and 2 food groups regarded as unhealthy in excessive amounts (high-fat dairy, and red meat) [21]. The daily intake of each food group was classified into 3 or 4 categories. For 16 healthy food groups, points from 0 to 4 were given to each intake category, with higher intake receiving more points. For the other 9 food groups, points from 0 to 2 were given according to the intake categories.",a7055af8-1fba-48e2-a197-ae8952d3fe5d
5,methods5," The Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) was a sum of all 25 food group scores, with a range of 0 to 49 [21]. The higher the Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) was, the better the diet quality was. A previously modified version of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) for pregnant women was used in this study [34], in which 8 components were positively scored (fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fish, dairy, nuts, monounsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio), and 1 component was negatively scored (red and processed meat). Zero or one points were assigned according to the median intake for each component. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was summed for each component score, and the range was 0 to 9, with higher scores showing better adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Alcohol consumption was excluded from the original Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) because alcohol intake was not recommended during pregnancy and our participants rarely drank alcohol during pregnancy.  2.3.",492dd648-6998-4b61-ad4e-7a1483766270
6,methods6," Covariates  We collected the general information about pregnancy face-to-face by a standard questionnaire. The study covariates included (1) socio-demographic characteristics: maternal age (<30 years/≥30 years), work (in employment/without employment), education (junior high school or below/senior high school or above), residence (urban/rural), and parity (0/≥1); (2) maternal health-related factors in early pregnancy: passive smoking (no/yes), anemia (no/yes), medication use (no/yes), and folate/iron supplements use (yes/no). Women with no paid employment outside their homes were regarded as without employment. People exposed to others’ tobacco smoke for ≥15 min/d was defined as exposure to passive smoking. Women with hemoglobin concentration <110 g/L in early pregnancy were diagnosed with anemia.  2.4.",2693f204-c718-4236-b72c-1d301da27b09
7,methods7," Statistical Analysis  Univariate comparisons between groups were tested by the χ2 test for categorical variables, and by the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables because of the non-normal distributions observed by the Shapiro–Wilk test. Considering the clustering in the design through hospitals, we used mixed logistic regression models to estimate ORs (95%CIs) for total congenital heart defects (CHD)s and congenital heart defects (CHD)s subtypes associated with Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). The Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were divided into four groups according to quartiles of the control distribution.",4ff234e0-e888-4c49-b3fb-0dfb710ec183
8,methods8," The confounding variables were adjusted in the models if they were reported to be risk factors for congenital heart defects (CHD) [4,5] and changed the estimated by more than 10% [35], which finally included maternal age, work, education, residence, parity, and maternal passive smoking, anemia, medication use, and folate/iron supplement use in early pregnancy. Total energy intake during pregnancy was adjusted in the models to indirectly reflect maternal BMI status that was not collected in the survey. p for trend was calculated by including quartile-specific median value in the model. The risk of congenital heart defects (CHD) associated with per 1 higher score of Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was assessed by mixed logistic regression models.",c3f6ef17-fdcf-45da-a9bc-c9e14c69e714
9,methods9," Subgroup analyses were performed by baseline characteristics including maternal age, work, education, residence, parity, and maternal passive smoking, anemia, medication use, and folate/iron supplement use in early pregnancy. The interaction between Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) or Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and each of the subgroup factors was tested by the likelihood ratio test comparing regression models with and without an interaction term. The receiver operating characteristic curves (receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC)) were constructed to determine the optimal cut-off values of Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in pregnancy for congenital heart defects (CHD) with the maximum Youden index (sensitivity + specificity − 1).",a112800b-7c8f-426f-8872-fc5cdc26e63c
10,methods10," The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) (AUCs) showed the accuracy of Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) as predictive markers for congenital heart defects (CHD). When the AUC > 0.5, the closer the AUC was to 1, the better the predictive power of the model was, as follows: AUC > 0.9, very good; AUC > 0.8, good; and AUC > 0.7, useful [36].  We used the Stata software (version 15.0; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) to conduct the statistical analyses. We set the statistical significance at 0.05 with two-sided.  3. Results  3.1. Baseline Characteristics of the Study Population  Among the 474 congenital heart defects (CHD) babies, 46.8% were diagnosed with ventricular septal defects (VSD), and 46.0% with ASD, followed by atrioventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, and tetralogy of fallot (Table S1).",bb9e73ab-159d-485e-ac51-f6e5da3b745b
11,methods11," Women in the cases were less likely to be in employment, have higher education levels, live in an urban area, and be nulliparity when compared with those in the controls (Table 1). Passive smoking, anemia, and medication use in early pregnancy were more common in the cases than in the controls, while folate/iron supplements use in early pregnancy was less common in the cases than in the controls. The proportion of babies with birth weight lower than 2500 g was higher in the cases than in the controls, while no difference in gestational age was found between the two groups. Pregnant women in the cases had lower intakes of energy and most nutrients except carbohydrate in comparison with those in the controls.

12,methods12," The Distribution of Food Components in Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) among Cases and Controls  The Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) scores for all 16 healthy food groups except dark green leafy vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy were significantly lower in the cases than in the controls (all p < 0.05) (Table 2). The Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) scores for juice, purchased deep-fried foods, high-fat dairy, and red meat were also significantly lower in the cases than the controls (all p < 0.05), while the Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) scores for the other five unhealthy food groups were not significantly different between groups (Table 2).",4ac4916a-14bc-4e4f-8666-ca4abb45b59e

Daily nutrient intakes during pregnancy by Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) categories among cases and controls are shown in Table S2 and Table S3, respectively. In both cases and controls, daily intakes of energy, macronutrients, and micronutrients were increased with higher scores of Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) (all p < 0.001).  3.3.",f327bd97-9e93-4da3-abb7-50bb752a4b3d
14,methods14," Associations of Maternal Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) during Pregnancy with congenital heart defects (CHD)  The risk of total congenital heart defects (CHD) was reduced with the increasing quartiles of Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), and the tests for trend were statistically significant (both p for trend <0.05) (Table 3). The fully adjusted ORs comparing the highest with the lowest quartiles of the Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were 0.26 (95%CI: 0.16–0.42) and 0.53 (95%CI: 0.34–0.83), respectively. The risk of total congenital heart defects (CHD) was reduced by 12% (OR: 0.88, 95%CI: 0.85–0.91) and 12% (OR: 0.88, 95%CI: 0.80–0.95) for per 1 higher score of Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), respectively.",ae0505b7-08a8-4fbf-888c-971632fc2e18

19,methods19," The inverse associations of maternal Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) during pregnancy with congenital heart defects (CHD) appeared to be stronger among women with lower education levels or in rural areas. This case-control study also suggested that maternal Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) during pregnancy had good predictive values for total congenital heart defects (CHD) and the subtypes in fetuses, with the AUCs close to 0.8.  To date, there was only one study investigating the relationship between maternal dietary quality and congenital heart defects (CHD) [18]. This previous study conducted in America found that better dietary quality, assessed by Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and Dietary Quality Index for Pregnancy, reduced the risk of congenital heart defects (CHD), which was consistent with the results in the current study.",2e0708cd-7298-4443-b4d8-a6194c2f1078
20,methods20," Some studies evaluated priori dietary quality indices in association with birth defects [37,38,39], but not congenital heart defects (CHD). These studies reported significant inverse associations of maternal Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with the risks of some birth defects (orofacial clefts, neural tube defects, and gastroschisis) [37,38], but not hypospadias [40]. There were three studies examining the risk of congenital heart defects (CHD) in relation to dietary patterns identified by posterior statistical analyses [15,16,17], rather than the priori indices. A study from America reported that a prudent dietary pattern high in reduced-fat milk, yogurt, fortified cereal, whole-wheat bread, and fish, and low in vegetables and fruits reduced congenital heart defects (CHD) risk [16]. The study in the Netherlands observed that the one-carbon-rich dietary pattern, which was high in fish and seafood, lowered the congenital heart defects (CHD) risk [17].",e47f0107-d9d0-420c-9679-9094958e5524
21,methods21," The study in Shaanxi China found that the prudent dietary pattern, which was high in white meats, red meats, vegetables, legumes, dairy, and snacks, and the dairy and egg pattern, which was high in dairy, nuts, and eggs, and low in beverages, decreased the congenital heart defects (CHD) risk [16]. Although these three studies have identified some posterior dietary patterns associated with congenital heart defects (CHD), it could hardly be applied in other populations because of the subjective. Our study focused on the priori dietary quality indices, to be more easily reproducible and comparable to prior related studies. The magnitude of the risk for congenital heart defects (CHD) associated with maternal Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in our study was approximately similar to that observed for congenital heart defects (CHD) in the previous study, with the lowest OR comparing the extreme quartiles being 0.53 (95%CI: 0.34–0.83) and 0.43 (95%CI: 0.25–0.75), respectively [18].",86805309-c834-48b1-b216-2095563f9285
22,methods22," The strength of the inverse association between dietary quality and congenital heart defects (CHD) risk seemed to be stronger for Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) than Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in the current study, similar to the stronger association for Dietary Quality Index for Pregnancy than Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with congenital heart defects (CHD) and other birth defects in the previous studies [18,37]. Since there has been no study investigating health outcomes in relation to maternal Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) in pregnancy, it is hard for us to compare the results about Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) in our study with other studies. More studies are needed to explore the relationships between maternal Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and health outcomes including congenital heart defects (CHD) and to validate the prediction of maternal Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) on health outcomes.  Maternal diet is critical to fetal growth and development.",0fa19f4f-adb9-4a5b-b9b6-c3e86e101111
23,methods23," Suboptimal diets in pregnancy can cause adverse pregnancy outcomes including congenital abnormalities [28]. Maternal low intakes of zinc, selenium, iron, niacin, and folate have been reported to reduce the risk of congenital heart defects (CHD) [6,7,8,11]. Maternal diets rich in these nutrients may benefit the development of the cardiovascular system in fetuses. Women with higher scores of Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) during pregnancy had higher intakes of these micronutrients in the current study, which may partly explain the protective effect of better dietary quality on congenital heart defects (CHD). Pregnant women with better dietary quality may have more opportunities to obtain nutrition knowledge and pay more attention to healthy diets, and thus have better nutritional status [15].",a8b01ff2-c10c-480d-9ece-2bb5acf1bf2d
24,methods24," In addition, maternal adherence to better dietary quality was reported to decrease maternal oxidative DNA damage and lipid oxidation [39], which may further benefit the normal development of the fetal cardiovascular system [41]. Maternal dietary quality is also likely to be a mediator of metabolic diseases including gestational diabetes mellitus and hypertension in pregnancy, which further influences the fetal cardiovascular system [42]. However, we could not further conduct the mediation analyses because women with diabetes have been excluded and there were only two women with gestational hypertension.  The current study provides valuable evidence for the relationship between maternal dietary quality in pregnancy and the risk of congenital heart defects (CHD). However, we should acknowledge some limitations. First, due to the limited sample size, the associations of dietary quality with other congenital heart defects (CHD) subtypes could not be separately investigated.",820f6a68-d157-4e82-b009-a02e1b9f1987
25,methods25," Further studies with large sample sizes are needed to explore the association with other congenital heart defects (CHD) subtypes. Second, selection bias cannot be excluded because pregnant women having congenital heart defects (CHD) fetuses tend to choose comprehensive hospitals for delivery. Selection bias may also come from the fact that this study did not recruit congenital heart defects (CHD) fetuses that did not survive. Third, recall bias cannot be excluded because maternal information during pregnancy was retrospectively reported by mothers waiting for delivery. However, previous studies have indicated that diets and events in pregnancy can be recalled well after years [43,44]. To reduce this bias, standard questionnaires and supporting materials such as food portion images and calendars were used to collect information to help participants recall accurately in the survey.",076f0cd1-ff59-41c6-8ccc-60edf5c624af
26,methods26," Fourth, exposure misclassification may cause because we collected dietary information during the entire pregnancy, rather than in the critical period of heart development in the 3rd–8th week of gestation. However, previous studies have shown that maternal dietary habits tend to be stable throughout pregnancy [27]. Finally, the possibility of residual confounding from unobserved and unknown factors cannot be excluded. For example, we did not collect information on gestational weight gain or BMI, which was reported to be associated with fetal congenital heart defects (CHD) [45]. In fact, the real causal relationship between dietary quality during pregnancy and congenital heart defects (CHD) cannot be revealed in the case-control study. Further intervention studies are needed to examine the influence of maternal dietary quality on fetal congenital heart defects (CHD).  5.",27f862c4-ef68-49c2-b387-90812abc8e55
27,methods27," Conclusions  In summary, this case-control study suggested that maternal Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), indicators of dietary quality, were negatively associated with the congenital heart defects (CHD) risk. Moreover, maternal Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) during pregnancy had good predictive values for congenital heart defects (CHD) in offspring. These results implied the importance of improving dietary quality in pregnancy to decrease the prevalence of congenital heart defects (CHD) in Northwest China. Further research is warranted to assess the validity of these scoring systems as predictive tools for congenital heart defects (CHD) in other populations. ",446df184-5cdf-49ac-b447-7bf421a01427
