0,introduction0,"Currently, no cure for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exists, it is therefore essential that effective and broadly applicable approaches to prevent or delay disease onset are developed. Accumulating data suggests that diet represents one such strategy accessible to all.  The Mediterranean diet (MeDi), has been widely recognised as a healthy eating model due to its correlation with low morbidity and mortality for many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes1,2, which are themselves risk factors for AD3,4. Indeed, accumulating research, including our own, has linked MeDi adherence with slower cognitive decline and reduced risk of AD5–7. Precisely how the MeDi confers such cognitive benefit remains to be determined; brain imaging studies likely offer some insight. Relatively few studies however, have examined the relationship of MeDi adherence to AD-related neuroimaging outcome measures.",8e17ae80-4909-4b3b-8f30-83a06198668f

To-date, only one study has directly examined the relationship between MeDi adherence and cerebral Aβ-amyloid (Aβ) load (a pathological hallmark of AD), with the authors reporting reduced cerebral Aβ load cross-sectionally among individuals with high MeDi adherence10.  There is a critical need to explore the relationship between MeDi and rates of cerebral Aβ accumulation using longitudinal data collected from a well-characterised ageing cohort.",41a6e20a-7b1d-45fc-b13a-e36d6fac412c

Thus, our findings suggest that adherence to the MeDi could potentially reduce this accumulation of Aβ by up to 60% over three years; thereby presenting a feasible strategy to slow the accumulation of cerebral AD pathology.  How MeDi adherence might exert such beneficial effects remains to be determined.",661a0a4c-a8ae-4a22-b7a9-6db92350c48d
24,discussion5," Specifically, it cannot be determined from the current study whether MeDi adherence is associated with reduced Aβ production and deposition, increased Aβ clearance, or a combination of both. Indeed, the MeDi is an abundant source of vitamin A (both preformed vitamin A: retinol and its esterified form, retinyl ester, found in foods from animal sources, including dairy products, fish, and meat; and pro-vitamin A carotenoids, found in plant pigments), which has been shown to demonstrate anti-oligomerization effects on Aβ in vitro22. Further, dietary deficiency of vitamin A increases cerebral Aβ deposition in animal models23. The monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid, oleic acid comprises the majority of olive oil, which is consumed readily as part of the MeDi. Oleic acid has been shown to inhibit activity of the amyloidogenic pathway enzyme Beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) in vitro24, and to ameliorate amyloidosis in a cellular model of AD25.",5f16c8c9-89ab-4dea-910c-10cb205b9e57
25,discussion6," MeDi adherence may also positively modulate levels of Aβ-degrading proteases. For example, MeDi adherence has been associated with reduced levels of fasting insulin 26, which consequently increases levels of ‘free’ insulin-degrading enzyme; a well-established Aβ-degrading protease27. The MeDi has also been linked to beneficial effects for multiple determinants of cardiovascular disease risk, including decreased low density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased high density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) cholesterol (see ref. 28 for an overview of associated randomised clinical trial (RCT)s). high density lipoprotein (HDL) maintains Aβ solubility within plasma and cerebrospinal fluid29, and increasing levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) has been postulated to enhance lipoprotein receptor-related protein clearance of Aβ (e.g ref. 30).",e46b42fe-4074-430b-925c-82d087c0cf1c
26,discussion7," Indeed, one might hypothesise that the most plausible explanation for the observed association between MeDi adherence and reduced Aβ accumulation in the current study is a complex milieu of beneficial effects rather than a single consummate anti-Aβ mechanism.  Our results suggest that fruit intake is an important element of MeDi adherence which confers benefit in our cohort, specifically; higher intake was associated with less accumulation of Aβ. Whilst the potential mechanism is unclear, we speculate that it may relate to polyphenolic content. For example, the citrus flavonoid nobiletin has been shown to decrease Aβ burden in the brains of AD mouse models31, whilst (−)-epicatechin (abundant in multiple fruits) has been associated both with reduced Aβ pathology in a double transgenic mouse model of AD, and potent inhibition of amyloidogenic processing in vitro32. The high concentration of vitamin C in fruits consumed as part of the MeDi (e.g.",6af36637-8986-4f71-a1a3-9679ad2a299e
27,discussion8," oranges, grapefruit and strawberries) may also contribute to slowing accumulation of cerebral AD pathology. Vitamin C supplementation has been shown to reduce amyloid plaque burden in the brain of a transgenic mouse model of AD which had been genetically engineered to be unable to synthesize its own vitamin C (important as the ability of rodents to synthesize vitamin C with no reliance on dietary supply has hampered previous investigations)33. Moreover, vitamin C has been shown to inhibit amyloid fibril formation in vitro34.  There are limitations to our report that require consideration; this is an observational study, therefore we can draw no conclusions regarding causality. Further, the Cancer Council of Victoria Food Frequency Questionnaire (CCVFFQ) utilised in this study relies on participants’ estimations of food intake over the previous year; this is a common limitation of studies of diet and can potentially lead to misclassification of dietary intake due to limited accuracy.",b22b4200-65f5-4ff8-be37-7039eb229f01
28,discussion9," This is particularly important with regards to cognitively impaired participants, thus, to circumvent this limitation, only cognitively normal older adults were included in the current analysis. Nevertheless, we recognise that ideally, a targeted intervention substantiated with biomarker measures for actual consumption/uptake would be utilised to both determine causality and to evade the limitations of self-report.  Many aspects of our study, however, provide confidence in our findings. We have utilised a well-characterised cohort thereby increasing the internal validity of our results. We have taken a rigorous approach to statistical analysis. The dietary data were collected using an instrument previously validated in epidemiological studies13,14. Moreover, our findings are consistent with many published studies which describe the benefits of MeDi adherence in the context of both AD risk and severity of cerebral pathology (e.g., refs 6,7,9,10,17).",de461815-8e1a-410a-b4fe-2509be125cca
29,discussion10,"  This is the first study to assess the relationship between MeDi adherence and change in cerebral Aβ burden over time in older adults. In summary, the results of this study highlight the potentially beneficial impact of MeDi adherence on slowing rates of cerebral Aβ accumulation in cognitively unimpaired older adults. Whilst validation of our findings is required using a targeted intervention, when our results are considered collectively with previous data linking the MeDi to improved cognition, it appears that MeDi adherence warrants further investigation in the quest to delay or ideally prevent AD onset.
