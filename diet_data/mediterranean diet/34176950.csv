0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Participants  This study represents a secondary analysis of the IMPACT BCN trial, a randomized clinical trial with a parallel group conducted at a University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain (2017–2020) including 1221 pregnant women at high risk for small for gestational age (SGA) randomly allocated at 19–23 weeks’ gestation into three groups: an MD intervention, a stress reduction program or non-intervention. Participants in the MD group (n = 407) received monthly individual and group educational sessions and free provision of extra-virgin olive oil and walnuts. Women in the stress reduction group (n = 407) underwent an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program adapted for pregnancy, consisting of weekly 2.5 h sessions and one full-day session. Women in the non-intervention group (n = 407) received pregnancy care as per institutional protocols. The Institutional Review Board of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona approved the study (HCB-2016-0830).",afc651bf-1ed0-44d6-b546-06171be1e649
1,methods1," All mothers provided written informed consent.  The main results of this trial have been previously described [26] and the study protocol has been described elsewhere [27]. For the present analysis, from the total sample of 1221 randomized participants, 215 participants were excluded because of missing data on dietary information, and 36 participants showed extreme energy intake outside predefined limits [28], including 970 participants at high risk of developing small for gestational age (SGA) during pregnancy in the final dataset (Figure 1).  2.2. Assessment of Dietary Intake  A 151-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) validated for the present study population [29], 7-day dietary recalls of the previous 7 days before the meeting, and a 17-item MD adherence score were administered by trained dietitians in a face-to-face interview at trial enrollment (19–23 weeks).",1ac70469-dae1-4544-8e31-b8a7bd71bae5
2,methods2," Food items were listed under 151 food groups: milk and dairy products, cereals and whole grains, vegetables, legumes, sausages, oils and fats, eggs, meat and fish, fast food, canned products, fruit, nuts, sweets and desserts and others (salt and sugar), and alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Food consumption derived from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and food records was converted into energy and nutrient intake with the CESNID and Moreiras composition tables using traditional recipes [30,31]. More detailed food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) validation can be found [29]. Participants filled out the 7-day dietary recalls. Detailed instructions about portion sizes and how to provide these household measures were also included in the food diary.  We asked all women about their dietary habits during pregnancy over the 3 months that preceded their enrollment in the study.",6b9e4eaa-2c64-412c-b591-a166f6007276
3,methods3," The study participants were classified according to the 17-item MD adherence score as low (<6 points), medium (6–11 points), and high adherence (≥12 points). Participants indicated their usual and frequent consumption of listed food items in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), based on nine frequency categories (ranging from never or <1 time/month to ≥6 times/day) and using common units or portion sizes. A total of 14 food groups were listed: milk and dairy products, cereals and whole grains, vegetables, legumes, sausages, oils and fats, eggs, meat and fish, fast food, canned products, fruit, nuts, sweets and desserts and others (salt and sugar), and alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  2.3. Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) Assessment  Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score was calculated from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data for all participants using the methodology of Shivappa et al. [21].",9a134c53-4915-4a48-bb1d-c4f942d6d42b
4,methods4," To create the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score, we first calculated the mean and standard deviation (SD) for each food parameter. In the present study, we included 33 food parameters to construct this score: 9 proinflammatory food parameters (energy, carbohydrate, fat, protein, cholesterol, saturated fat, trans-fat, vitamin B12, and iron intake) and 24 anti-inflammatory parameters (MUFAs, PUFAs, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, fiber, vitamin B6, folic acid, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, β-carotene, oregano, pepper, onion, garlic, tea, zinc, selenium, and magnesium intake). We calculated the z-score by subtracting the ‘‘standard global mean’’ from the amount reported by each participant and dividing this value by the “global standard deviation”. To reduce “right skewness”, this z-score was converted to a centered percentile score. Then, we multiplied this score by the respective food parameter effect score derived from the Shivappa et al.",1f9d0c7f-b9da-4b49-87a1-6b9c80165740

Maternal Characteristics  Maternal characteristics were obtained from different questionnaires and interviews administered to study participants and included maternal age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (low/medium/high), occupation status, educational level, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), chronic hypertension, diabetes, parity (multiparous/nulliparous), adverse obstetrical history (fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, stillbirth), use of assisted reproductive technologies, smoking during pregnancy, alcohol habits during pregnancy, yoga/relaxation during pregnancy, exercise during pregnancy, and baseline MD score (low/medium/high). Obesity was defined if pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was above 30 kg/m2.  2.5.",e6b55a80-6738-48a4-80a9-bb5614bce7d0
6,methods6," Perinatal Outcomes  Gestational diabetes mellitus (Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)): The screening and diagnosis of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) were performed during the second trimester of gestation (24–28 weeks). The two-step approach to testing for Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was based on first screening with the administration of a 50 g oral glucose solution followed by a 1 h venous glucose determination. Women whose glucose levels met or exceeded 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) underwent a 100 g, 3 h diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test (oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)). Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was diagnosed in women who had two or more abnormal values on the 3 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Reference values for the 3 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were: basal glucose < 105 mg/dL (5.8 mmol/L), 1 h glucose < 190 mg/dL (10.6 mmol/L), 2 h glucose < 165 mg/dL (9.2 mmol/L), and 3 h glucose < 145 mg/dL (8.1 mmol/L).",4661c6c2-cd19-42d5-8d27-5e78e6f67a88
7,methods7,"  Preeclampsia was defined as systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) ≥ 90 mmHg at least 4 h apart after 20 weeks of gestation and proteinuria of ≥300 mg in 24 h, according to specific guidelines [32].  Newborns’ birthweight: Birthweight percentile was calculated with birthweight adjusted by gestational age at delivery and gender, according to standards for the Spanish population [26]. small for gestational age (SGA) was defined as birthweight below the 10th percentile, severe small for gestational age (SGA) as birthweight below the 3rd percentile [33,34].  Preterm birth was defined as delivery < 37 weeks’ gestation [35].",5e6c4d78-f5b7-4ff1-bc49-fc647b5cb385
8,methods8,"  Adverse perinatal outcome (Adverse perinatal outcome (APO)) was defined as a composite score of preterm birth, preeclampsia, perinatal mortality, severe small for gestational age (SGA), neonatal acidosis, and Apgar score below 7 at 5 min, or the presence of any major neonatal morbidity.  2.6. Statistical Analysis  First, participants were distributed into tertiles according to Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score. Descriptive statistics with the mean ± SD for the participants’ baseline characteristics were applied. Categorical variables are expressed as percentages. The comparison between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score tertiles involved the use of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables, with tertile 1 as the lowest Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score and tertile 3 as the highest Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score.",b7c85148-98d4-4725-8747-3bf934147bb9
9,methods9," Additionally, ANOVA was used to determine differences in the baseline dietary intakes of nutrients and food parameters among the three Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score tertiles. Normality was assessed for all the variables using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. For non-normally distributed variables, differences between the groups were assessed using the Kruskal–Wallis test. For non-normally distributed variables, the values are expressed as median (25th, 75th percentile). Logistic regression models were used to assess the association of Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score with different clinical pregnancy outcomes: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia, small for gestational age (SGA), severe small for gestational age (SGA), and preterm birth. Tertile 3 (more proinflammatory diet) was set as the reference group. Data were expressed using odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals.",8de030cc-2f52-4397-b124-6c6223ad509e

Finally, linear regression analyses were used to investigate the possible associations of maternal Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score with pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and newborn’s birthweight percentile. In this case, Tertile 1 (more anti-inflammatory diet) was set as the reference group. Four models were constructed.",d59f9ee0-d524-40c4-8f93-cfd75df6884b

Regarding medical history, 11.2% of participants were obese, 4.9% had diabetes, and 4.2% had chronic hypertension. The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) mean in this study was −2.94 ± 1.12 units. Significant differences were observed for maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and exercise during pregnancy (p-value 0.011 and <0.001, respectively). No significant differences among Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) tertiles were observed in socioeconomic status; age; or perinatal outcomes including Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia, birthweight, cesarean section, gestational age at delivery, birthweight percentile, small for gestational age (SGA), severe small for gestational age (SGA), prematurity, and Adverse perinatal outcome (APO).  3.2.",89163b5c-e6f7-4f46-b330-e791eb7cb790
13,methods13," Maternal Dietary Characteristics and Adherence to MD According to Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) Tertile  Overall, when comparing participants according to Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score, participants with the highest score (proinflammatory) showed lower consumption of nuts, fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish and seafood, lean meat, dairy products, onion, garlic, pepper, oregano, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), and alcohol and higher intake of refined cereals, and processed meat. Lower adherence to MD was also observed in the MD score median (25th to 75th percentile) 9 (7 to 11) vs. 6 (4.25 to 8), p < 0.001. Data are shown in Table 2.  Table 3 shows the dietary intake of participants among Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) tertiles.",3352539a-2c00-4133-b21b-455f178ea6e1
14,methods14," Women in the tertile 3 (proinflammatory) consumed lower levels of energy, protein, dietary fiber, total fat, saturated fatty acids (SFAs), MUFAs, PUFAs, linoleic and α-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)), docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), and dietary cholesterol, as well as lower consumption of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). Tertile 3 showed a higher intake of trans fat compared to other tertiles.  3.3. Association of Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) with Maternal body mass index (BMI) and Newborn’s Birthweight  Regarding the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), significant associations were observed in Tertile 3 and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (full-adjusted β = 0.88 kg/m2; 95% CI: 0.31 to 1.45) (Table 4). Maternal Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score (as a continuous variable) was directly associated with pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (full-adjusted β = 0.",aa2d5e7d-3950-4ba3-a9e6-84c54ae00c33
15,methods15,"32 kg/m2 per 1-unit increase in Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII); 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.52).  For women allocated in the highest tertile of Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score (Table 4), we found significant associations between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score and low birthweight percentile, while no significant associations were observed for tertile 2 (full-adjusted β = −9.84th; 95% CI: −19.57 to −0.12). Maternal Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score (as a continuous variable) was inversely associated with newborn birthweight percentile (full-adjusted β = −4.05th per 1-unit increase in Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII); 95% CI: −7.42 to −0.68).  4. Discussion  The present study shows a direct association between an anti-inflammatory Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and lower pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and higher newborn birthweight percentile.",d8ca3299-765f-4a76-b242-e9077848c858
16,methods16," Moreover, individuals with higher Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) present higher adherence to the adapted 17-point MD adherence score and healthier nutritional profile. To our knowledge, this is the first study that assessed the relationship between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and maternal body mass index (BMI) and birthweight percentile in pregnant women at high risk.  4.1. Nutritional Intake According to Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) Index  Our results showed that individuals in the lowest Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) tertile (mostly anti-inflammatory diet) had a higher intake of antioxidants; vitamins and minerals; fiber; and PUFAs, including omega-3 derivatives. Both antioxidants present in fruits and vegetables and dietary fiber have been negatively associated with inflammation, which contributes to less lipid oxidation [36].",e230d621-e174-4c8f-800c-f4d47e7acb52
17,methods17," Although higher protein intake was associated with a higher Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score, lower protein intake was observed with a higher Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score, which was consistent with other studies [24,37,38]. However, depending on the protein food sources, protein intake may have different effects on the inflammatory response, i.e., plant-based vs. animal protein food sources [39,40].  As for food groups, individuals in the lowest Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) tertile consumed more plant-based products, such as extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), nuts, vegetables, and fruits, and healthy animal protein food sources such as blue fish, and these findings are consistent with previous studies [41,42,43].  Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score has been postulated as a potential dietary advice tool as guidance for individuals in setting dietary goals to reduce inflammatory levels associated with unhealthy dietary patterns [23].  4.2.",98c0a404-a554-458a-934f-4a6426e942e7
18,methods18," Mediterranean Diet Adherence  Participants with higher MD adherence showed lower Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII). The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects of MD are well known and encompass downregulating the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules and decreasing proinflammatory molecules such as interleukins, chemokines, or soluble endothelial adhesion molecules, among others [44]. In this sense, Kibret et al. [45] observed a significant association between adherence to a healthy dietary pattern and lower Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk (OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.99)).  Another potential mechanism underlying health benefits associated with healthy dietary patterns is the modulation of gut microbiota, which has been linked to metabolic dysfunction during pregnancy [46].  Several studies showed that high adherence to healthy dietary patterns, such as MD, was associated with a lower Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score [37,43,47].",ca33edd6-c697-426d-be4c-5f6aef2923a3
19,methods19," Both dietary quality scores share common dietary components, which can explain why both scores showed potential health benefits during pregnancy.  4.3. Perinatal Outcomes and Birthweight  We did not find significant associations between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score and small for gestational age (SGA). However, significant inverse associations were observed between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and newborn birthweight percentile. Similar findings were described in Project Viva, a longitudinal cohort of 2128 mother–child pairs from Massachusetts, USA [24]. Our results support the evidence, suggesting that a maternal diet rich in antioxidants (e.g., fruits and vegetables) and a low Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score drive a newborn weight appropriate for gestational age at birth [48,49].",8db377fb-06e9-4e9f-b10b-c21f8f80b870
20,methods20,"  The links between pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia [50], Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and preterm delivery [51] may be mediated by inflammatory status [52]. However, the mechanisms involved between pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and inflammation remain unclear. It must be noted that pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and inflammation are both linked to dietary patterns. Obesity during pregnancy is associated with many obstetric and perinatal complications, the risk increasing with the degree of obesity, including hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and section rates [53]. Moreover, newborns of women with overweight or obesity are more likely to be premature and of high birthweight [54].",345f2e11-46ff-49ec-92cd-1b91f3094932
21,methods21,"  The underlying mechanisms of inflammation and fetal growth restriction may be mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress, which are associated with shallow placental invasion and abnormal vascular development, leading to placental blood circulation problems [39,49,55]. This inflammatory and oxidative stress response may be particularly relevant in overweight or obese women before pregnancy, which is aligned with our results.  Our results did not show any correlation between the occurrence of such diseases as chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score during pregnancy. These findings are aligned with the findings described by Sen et al. [24].  4.4. Strengths and Limitations  In our study, dietary information came from a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), which was designed to evaluate maternal dietary intake in the present study population [29].",39fd9def-af89-4d09-be7c-6dba5eff77b8
22,methods22," Moreover, pregnant women completed dietary assessment (19–23 weeks of gestation) before their oral glucose tolerance test (24–28 weeks of gestation), which means that Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosis, treatment, or dietary changes could not affect dietary information. Our study also has some limitations. Although the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was validated in the present study population, misclassification of study participants due to measurement errors may have occurred. Furthermore, the average consumption frequency of seasonal foods is especially critical, and the fixed food list in fixed portion sizes is another source of measurement error. Finally, the use of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to present data on absolute intakes of foods and nutrients is limited without prior calibration of these data by a reference method. No validation of the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score was performed for the present study population.",145e5536-e544-48a9-bb6a-f8f3e0a22372
23,methods23," Our study includes pregnant women at 19–23 weeks’ gestation, and perinatal outcomes may be associated both with the diet before pregnancy and diet during pregnancy. Moreover, we collected dietary information on MD adherence at 19–23 weeks’ gestation and were not able to differentiate between the pre-pregnancy diet and the dietary changes due to pregnancy. However, participants showing low MD adherence at 19–23 weeks’ gestation would probably have the same adherence score and/or dietary habits. In addition, the cross-sectional design of the present study, which does not allow attributing conclusions to plausible causes, and potential residual confounding are limitations of the present study. Additionally, the generalizability of our findings may be limited due to the study participants’ demographic characteristics.  5. Conclusions  At mid-gestation, pregnant women with an anti-inflammatory diet profile showed a high adherence to MD.",fae7cc6e-86a3-4ca9-a9c1-9a87cf6ec2ce
24,methods24," In those women, Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) score was associated with pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and the newborn’s birthweight percentile. Nutritional interventions during pregnancy aiming to improve dietary patterns could be an effective measure to improve the maternal dietary inflammatory profile.
