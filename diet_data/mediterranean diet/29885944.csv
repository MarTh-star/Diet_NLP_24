0,methods0,"2.1. Eligibility Criteria This review included studies published between March 2009 and March 2019 that investigated associations between dietary patterns and renal health outcomes among the general populations without major kidney diseases. Studies on a priori- or a posteriori-defined dietary patterns were included. The search was limited to the following renal health outcomes: chronic kidney disease (CKD), albuminuria, proteinuria, glomerular hyperfiltration, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline, dialysis, death due to renal cause, kidney stones, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR)), eGFR, and creatinine clearance rate. The primary outcome was chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 [1].",cfc928e2-2dd9-4e7f-a366-3903558f2061
1,methods1," Secondary outcomes included albuminuria and proteinuria, defined as a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) 30–299 mg/g [22], dialysis, death due to renal causes, kidney stones, eGFR decline, which is a measure of the decrease in eGFR over a given period of time with rapid eGFR decline previously observed to be associated with renal impairment [23], glomerular hyperfiltration, which may precede chronic kidney disease (CKD) development and defined as an eGFR ≥ 120 mL/min/1.73 m2 [23], and creatinine clearance rate, increases in which have been associated with renal impairment [24].  Studies were excluded if they did not report primary data (review articles, editorials, non-research letters), were of a case-reports, case-series, or ecological design, were not conducted in humans, lacked dietary pattern data, renal function outcomes or measures of association (hazard ratios, odds ratios, relative risks, beta correlation coefficients).",7ea9e991-de0b-42f0-85e2-f33b8ced6052
2,methods2," Studies were also excluded if they focused on a population with a disease, or if participants were younger than 21 years. Lastly, studies were excluded if they only investigated components of a dietary pattern, but not the whole dietary pattern in relation to renal outcomes.  2.2. Literature Search, Screening and Data Extraction A pilot literature search was conducted; we observed that the majority of studies relevant to this review were published within the past 10 years. As such, PubMed and Embase were searched for relevant studies from March 2009 to March 2019. Search strategies were developed a priori for each database with assistance from a National Institutes of Health (National Institutes of Health (NIH)) librarian and the outline of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA)) 2009 flow diagram was followed to screen studies for this review.",3951b1a1-9998-41bf-98cb-766a2478eebe
3,methods3," The search targeted titles and abstracts as well as subject headings. Search terms consisted of the renal outcomes, dietary patterns, and observational studies. We did not find any clinical trials in the literature search. The search strategy and search history are presented in Supplemental Table S1.  After this literature search, the title and abstracts of the resulting records were screened for eligibility, and then the full text of the retained records were assessed for final inclusion decisions (Figure 1). Major studies that were published before 2009 and indexed in PubMed and the reference lists of relevant research articles that were not covered in the literature search were also searched for. Relevant data were abstracted from the retained publications using a standard form. The major findings from the included studies are summarized by different dietary patterns.  3. Results A total of 4343 unique records were obtained from the literature search.",7d7264d4-4439-477b-b342-b67de33c635c
4,methods4," After title and abstract screening, 61 eligible records remained. After the full text review, 20 articles were included. Six additional articles were also included; five were found from the bibliographies of the included full text articles and one was found from an informal PubMed search of major relevant studies published before 2009 (Figure 1). The main characteristics of the prospective (n = 16) and cross-sectional studies (n = 11) are presented in Table 1 and Supplemental Table S2, respectively. Descriptions of the a priori and a posteriori dietary patterns are presented in Supplemental Tables S3 and S4, respectively. Below, we describe the major findings from this review by different dietary patterns.  3.1.",92571e45-d554-40e3-9b6e-53e337f8ec17
5,methods5," Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) Diet The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is characterized by a high intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy products, and whole grains and a low intake of sodium, sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats [41]. In the studies included in this review, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score was calculated as the sum of 6, 8 or 9 individual component scores [42,43] (Supplemental Table S3).  Ten studies examined the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet as the exposure.",1c360e54-fda0-44d0-b7e0-b0df1dc699dd
6,methods6," Among these studies, chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence or prevalence was assessed as the outcome in five studies [30,34,35,44,45], incident kidney stones [32,33], microalbuminuria [25,31], or eGFR decline [25,35] were assessed in two studies and dialysis, death due to renal cause, and a composite outcome of dialysis and death due to renal cause were assessed in one study [26].  Three prospective studies investigated associations between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) [30,34,35] (Figure 2). Two of these studies, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)) study and the National Institute on Aging, Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span Study (NIA-HANDLS) were conducted in the United States, and one study, the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS)), was conducted in Iran.",8269425d-d2c0-438e-b0fb-4bdc123873d3
7,methods7," The Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) [34] (total N = 1630, mean age of 42.8 years) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study [30] (total N = 14,882, age range of 45 to 65 years) observed significant decreases in the risk of incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with greater Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet adherence.  Two cross-sectional studies investigated associations between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD) [44,45], which were conducted in the United States and Korea. The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [45] reported significant decreases in the risk of prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD) when comparing the highest to the lowest level of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet adherence.",d43f0186-9565-43a5-b726-6ef328269971
8,methods8," In the NIA-HANDLS (total N = 1534, mean age of 48 years), a lower risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with greater Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet adherence was also observed, but only among participants who were in poverty [35] and not overall. However, the inference of the findings from these studies was hindered by their cross-sectional design and ambiguous temporal relationship.  In addition to chronic kidney disease (CKD), prospective studies were conducted on other renal health outcomes in association with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. In the Nurses’ Health Study I (Nurses’ Health Study I (NHSI)), the Nurses’ Health Study II (Nurses’ Health Study II (Nurses’ Health Study I (NHSI)I)), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study [32,33], a greater adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was associated with significant decreases in the risk of kidney stones.",5de3cde4-a38a-4b46-9553-2349cf162e8b
9,methods9," In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study [31], greater adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was significantly associated with a decreased risk of microalbuminuria, yet this association was not observed in the Nurses’ Health Study I (NHSI) [25]. Among the two studies examining Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and eGFR decline, the Nurses’ Health Study I (NHSI) reported a significant decreased risk of eGFR decline, [25] while the NIA-HANDLS reported no significant association [35]. The National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons Diet and Health (National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP) study observed significant decreases in the risk of death due to renal cause and a composite renal outcome of death due to renal cause and initiation of dialysis when comparing the lowest to the highest quintile of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet adherence [26].",9f32a23c-913f-4cbc-a340-ecaad70dd16c
10,methods10,"  In summary, the majority of studies found that higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores were associated with lower risk of poor renal outcomes. The associations between higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and lower risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney stones were generally consistent across studies, while the associations with eGFR and microalbuminuria were less consistent.  3.2. Mediterranean Diet The Mediterranean diet is characterized by a high intake of non-refined cereals, fruits and nuts, vegetables, legumes, high ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) to polyunsaturated acids (polyunsaturated acids (PUFA)), high to moderate intake of fish and low to moderate intake of red meat, poultry, full-fat dairy products, and alcohol [46,47].",f707422a-40aa-4ea7-a5b6-da6fbcab8be1
11,methods11," In the studies included in this review, the Mediterranean diet was calculated as the sum of 8, 9 or 11 individual component scores [48,49,50] (Supplemental Table S3).  Five studies examined the Mediterranean diet as the exposure. Among these studies, chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence was assessed as the outcome in two studies [27,28], and incident kidney stones [29], eGFR decline [28], the creatinine clearance rate [51], dialysis, death due to renal causes, and a composite outcome of dialysis and death due to renal causes [26] were assessed in one study.  Two prospective studies, the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) in Iran and the Northern Manhattan Study (Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS)) in the United States, investigated associations between the Mediterranean diet and incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) [27,28] with follow-up durations of 6.1 and 6.9 years, respectively.",142c5bf6-f754-4e1c-87d1-df1b8c002e18
12,methods12," Among these two studies, the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) reported a significant decreased risk of incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) [27], while the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS) reported no significant association when comparing the lowest to the highest category of Mediterranean diet adherence [28].  As for other renal health outcomes, in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra Follow up (SUN) project, a prospective study in Spain, Mediterranean diet adherence was associated with a decreased risk of kidney stones [29]. The ATTICA study in Greece did not report any significant associations between the Mediterranean diet and the creatinine clearance rate [51]. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP study reported significant decreases in death due to renal causes and a composite outcome of death due to renal causes and initiation of dialysis when comparing the lowest to the highest categories of Mediterranean diet adherence [26].",8e74056e-25cf-437a-b41d-c91833d08cce
13,methods13," No significant associations of the Mediterranean diet with eGFR decline [28] or the creatinine clearance rate [51] were reported.  In summary, a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was significantly associated with decreased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney stones, and death due to renal causes in some studies. However, studies in this regard are limited and more studies to replicate these findings are warranted.  3.3. Vegetarian Diet Four studies examined the vegetarian diet as the exposure. Among these studies, chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence was assessed as the outcome in two studies [40,52], and kidney stones [39] and eGFR [53] were each assessed in one study. Descriptions of the vegetarian diets examined in these studies are presented in Supplemental Tables S3 and S4.",a448741f-5b91-47c4-8366-8e42a2fab1db
14,methods14,"  The Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS), the only prospective study on chronic kidney disease (CKD), reported significant decreases in risk of incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) when comparing the highest to the lowest tertial of the “lacto-vegetarian” diet [40]. A cross-sectional study in Taiwan also reported that “vegan” and “ovo-lacto vegetarian” diets were associated with significant decreases in risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared to an “omnivore” diet [52]. As for other kidney health outcomes, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study was a prospective study that reported significant decreases in risk of incident kidney stones when comparing vegetarian and to a meat eaters diets [39].  In summary, studies on vegetarian diets and kidney health are sparse. Existing data appear to suggest that a vegetarian-type diet pattern was associated with a significantly decreased risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney stones.  3.4.",046e40ae-838e-4db6-b74a-5e6680dd9a39
15,methods15," Other Diet Scores Five studies examined other diet scores as the exposure. Among these studies, chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence or prevalence was assessed as the outcome in three studies [37,38,54] and dialysis, death due to renal cause, and a composite outcome of dialysis and death due to renal cause [26], eGFR decline [37], and eGFR [55] were each assessed as an outcome in one study. Descriptions of the diet scores assessed in these studies are presented in Supplemental Table S3.  Three prospective studies investigated associations between the American Heart Association’s (American Heart Association’s (AHA)) Life’s Simple 7 Healthy Diet Score [36], the Dietary Guidelines Adherence Index (Dietary Guidelines Adherence Index (DGAI)) [37], and the Total Diet score (Total Diet score (TDS)) [38] and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Figure 2).",e6a8b5a0-10cf-4b03-969a-ce8caa5b19cd
16,methods16," In the Framingham Offspring Cohort study, greater adherence to the Dietary Guidelines Adherence Index (DGAI) was associated with a significant decreased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [37]. No significant associations for the American Heart Association’s (AHA) Healthy Diet Score, or the Total Diet score (TDS), were reported [36,38].  In the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP study, the Alternative Healthy Eating Index and Healthy Eating Index but not the Recommended Food Score were significantly associated with a decreased risk of death due to renal cause and a composite outcome of death due to renal cause and dialysis [26]. No associations between the Dietary Guidelines Adherence Index (DGAI) and eGFR decline were observed in the Framingham Offspring Cohort Study [37].",7d6c226c-a7c6-4b3e-a1ba-208e89cff9a2
17,methods17," In a cross-sectional analysis of the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men and the Prospective Investigation of Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors in Sweden, the Adapted Dietary Inflammatory Index (Adapted Dietary Inflammatory Index (ADII)) was associated with a significantly lower eGFR [55]. However, inference from the findings from this study was hindered by the cross-sectional design.  In summary, although some diet scores, such as the Dietary Guidelines Adherence Index (DGAI), were significantly associated with a decreased risk of adverse renal outcomes, more studies on each diet score are needed to make any definitive conclusions.  3.5. A Posteriori Diet Patterns Six studies examined a posteriori dietary patterns as the exposure.",ae49b91b-70b9-4ca3-b27d-23f20bb55d6e
18,methods18," Among these studies, chronic kidney disease (CKD) was assessed as the outcome in four studies [40,56,57,58], microalbuminuria was assessed in two studies [25,59], and eGFR decline [25] and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) [59] were each assessed as an outcome in one study. Descriptions of the a posteriori dietary patterns are presented in Supplemental Table S4.  The Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) was the only prospective study and observed that a “High fat, high sugar” diet pattern was significantly associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [40]. Three cross-sectional studies examined chronic kidney disease (CKD) as an outcome. Among these studies, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey observed that a “Minerals and Vitamins” diet pattern was associated with a significant decrease in risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [56].",d911d86d-5814-4f1b-8e21-0387a652e49c
19,methods19," In the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)), a “Whole grains and fruit” diet pattern was associated with a significantly decreased risk of microalbuminuria and was inversely related to urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) [59]. In the China Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a “Traditional Southern” diet pattern was associated with a significantly increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), while a “Modern” diet pattern was associated with a significantly decreased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [57]. In the Irish Nun and Eye Study, an “Unhealthy” diet pattern was associated with a significantly increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [58].  In Nurses’ Health Study I (NHSI), greater adherence to a “Western” diet pattern was associated with an increased risk for microalbuminuria but not eGFR decline.",af4b5dcd-5799-42c2-9ebc-c898316a20b9
20,methods20,"  In summary, “unhealthy” a posteriori dietary patterns were associated with significant increases in risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) but the associations between “healthy” a posteriori dietary patterns and chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk were less consistent. More prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.  4. Discussion In general, studies on dietary patterns and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and related adverse renal outcomes in the general population are limited. The majority of studies were conducted on a priori dietary patterns, with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet being the most commonly investigated. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet appeared to be associated with improved kidney function although there was variability in the associations.",d3cb84b3-7749-4284-880e-7381f4cd1a26
21,methods21," Less evidence exists on the Mediterranean and vegetarian dietary patterns but the results from the few available prospective studies suggest a protective association with kidney function. A small number of studies have been conducted on other diet scores which generally found that healthier diets were associated with improved kidney health but more studies on each particular diet score are needed. Among the a posteriori dietary patterns, the “unhealthy” patterns were all significantly associated with adverse renal outcomes, whereas only a small number of the “healthy” dietary patterns were significantly associated with a reduced risk for kidney disease.  Although the precise underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear, the associations between healthful dietary patterns, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diet, and lower risk of adverse renal outcomes summarized in this review are biologically plausible.",62d28e8f-b60f-42e0-b85c-e9cc064d6efd
22,methods22," The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been recommended by the American Heart Association for the management of hypertension and cardiovascular disease [41] and thus could improve kidney health by reducing cardiometabolic risk factors such as decreasing high blood pressure [60], oxidative stress [61], and endothelial dysfunction [62] and improving plasma lipid levels [63] and insulin sensitivity [64]. The omega-3 fatty acid content of the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in fish, nuts, and olive oil, could improve kidney health through the high monounsaturated fatty acid to saturated fatty acid ratio, which has been associated with improved plasma lipid profiles and insulin resistance and reduced blood pressure [63,65,66].  Biomarkers of inflammation have been linked to the progression of kidney disease [67].",8865fdec-a0a3-4561-8187-495db5894356
23,methods23," Diets rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and nuts, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean, vegetarian and “Healthy” diet patterns, have been inversely associated with markers of inflammation including CRP [68] and soluble ICAM-1 [69], while “unhealthy” diet patterns, such as diets high in fats and processed foods, have been directly associated with elevated markers of inflammation including CRP [68], ICAM-1 [69], and VCAM-1 [70]. Fruits, vegetables, and nuts are also rich in important antioxidant compounds (vitamins, selenium, polyphenol, magnesium) that may improve endothelial function [71]. Furthermore, plant-derived foods (fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains) are high in fiber and have a low glycemic index and load which may reduce chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk factors such as obesity and diabetes [72,73].",4932ed99-67e4-4b3b-bde3-69b7f85eb65a
24,methods24,"  Diets rich in plant protein, magnesium, and potassium and low in animal protein, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean, vegetarian, and “Healthy” dietary patterns, have a low dietary acid load [74,75]. Animal experiments and human studies suggest that a lower dietary acid load is associated with a slower eGFR decline [74,75,76,77]. Mechanisms underlying the association of dietary acid load and kidney injury may include reducing pro-fibrotic factors such as angiotensin II, endothelin-1 and aldosterone thereby lowering the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [78,79,80] and decreasing the workload of the nephrons. Vegetable proteins may also contain beneficial antioxidants, such as isoflavones, which could reduce endothelial dysfunction [81].",d26c8a80-dbaf-4fce-8fd2-49c7c01d457d
25,methods25,"  On the other hand, unhealthy dietary patterns, such as the “western-style diet”, “High fat, high sugar”, “Traditional Southern”, and “Unhealthy” diet patterns, are characterized by high intake of meat, sugar desserts, high fat foods, high-sugar drinks, and refined grains, and may adversely affect renal function through impairment of renal vascularization, increased steatosis, impaired hormonal regulation, and increased inflammation [82].  It should be noted that the populations in the studies included in this review generally reported very low incidences of chronic diseases that are major risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. This suggests that at baseline, these populations were at low overall risk for adverse renal outcomes. Heterogeneity in data collection methods and analytical approaches across studies were noticed.",a8cf7ea3-7662-4606-b146-c100ce516bac
26,methods26," The calculation of certain diet scores, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diet scores, differed between studies (Supplemental Tables S3 and S4). For example, in one cross-sectional study, certain components of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score were adapted to the unique diet of the KNHANES study cohort in Korea [45]. Differences between studies in the assessment of renal outcomes were also observed. For example, different equations were used to determine the eGFR (i.e., Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration vs. Modification in Diet and Renal Disease equations) that was used to stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, some of the studies of small sample size did not have the power to adjust for a comprehensive list of potential confounders [44,51,53] and thus residual confounding in these studies is an important limitation that should be acknowledged.",372fa260-a040-4d1b-b475-40338a7dc309
27,methods27," Furthermore, renal outcomes were not always clearly defined in the included studies. For example, the studies that assessed kidney stones as the outcome used self-report and the types of kidney stones assessed were frequently not clearly defined. In future studies, refined categorization of the clinical phenotype of the outcome may be important to clarify biological mechanisms driving the associations between dietary patterns and kidney stones. Also, the majority of available studies were conducted in white populations and only one study in this review investigated socioeconomic disparities in the associations between dietary patterns and renal outcomes, observing a higher risk among low-income individuals [44]. As such, more longitudinal and prospective cohort studies investigating dietary patterns and renal function among minority and disadvantaged populations are needed.",67aacfba-7fb7-4054-b6f8-a0ec05c5b38c
28,methods28,"  Our narrative review is the first to provide a summary of the findings from studies aimed at using dietary patterns for the prevention of adverse renal outcomes. Several findings from this review may be of interest to future studies wishing to investigate dietary patterns and renal function for chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevention. We observed that a priori healthy dietary patterns, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet, generally had significant protective associations towards renal function whereas the results on a posteriori dietary patterns were mixed. It should also be noted that “unhealthy” dietary patterns provide useful insight into which dietary factors should be avoided to maintain kidney health.",d7366990-9ec2-43bc-b2cb-ae07e5cba0e0
29,methods29," Furthermore, this review revealed that studies calculating the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score were more frequent and less research exists on the Mediterranean diet, vegetarian diet, and other diet scores such as the AHEI, HEI, Dietary Guidelines Adherence Index (DGAI) and Total Diet score (TDS), and a posteriori dietary patterns. More prospective studies on these types of dietary patterns are needed.  5. Conclusions In conclusion, the findings from this systematic review suggest that among the limited number of studies that have been conducted, following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diets may be useful in promoting kidney health and preventing chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the general population. More studies, in particular among minorities, are warranted to investigate the role of diet, a potentially modifiable factor, in kidney health. ",f80b70cd-6c78-44f6-adfd-d4390ed8f3c4
