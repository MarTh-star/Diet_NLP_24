0,introduction0,"Hepatic steatosis is the most common cause of liver disease.1 In westernised countries, hepatic steatosis affects up to 34% of the general population and up to 74% of obese individuals, depending on the definition used.2–4 Hepatic steatosis—fat content of more than 5% of liver volume—is the first recognisable stage of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)).1 Hepatic steatosis, particularly non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), may progress to end-stage liver disease including fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.5 Moreover, as hepatic steatosis increases the risk of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), its prevention is of public health importance.6 An unhealthy dietary pattern remains one of the primary targets of lifestyle modification for the prevention and management of hepatic steatosis and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",0ee6032c-1ac0-4672-a48d-57c84f2bebba
1,introduction1,"7 8  The Mediterranean diet has been recently recommended for treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).9 In recent years, a growing body of evidence supports the idea that the Mediterranean diet may be the reference nutritional profile for the prevention of hepatic steatosis development.10–12 Adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been reported to have a beneficial impact on risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD),13 14 type 2 diabetes15 and metabolic syndrome.16 Trial evidence demonstrated the potential benefits of the Mediterranean diet against progress of hepatic steatosis focusing on individuals with existing hepatic steatosis, either alone17–22 or associated with metabolic risk factors such as obesity or diabetes.22–25 Research among those without clinically manifest hepatic steatosis is restricted to observational evidence, reporting an inverse association that greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower prevalence of hepatic steatosis.",5e8feadd-1133-437e-b16b-2b3c650a9413
2,introduction2,"26 27 However, the cross-sectional design of these studies limits inference for causal associations and can be used mainly for hypothesis generation. Relevant longitudinal evidence for the primary prevention of hepatic steatosis or non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been reported only by the Framingham Heart Study, with a significant inverse association of adherence to the Mediterranean diet with risk of hepatic steatosis in 1521 adults over 6 years of follow-up,28 but evidence is lacking in Europe.  Given the limited evidence from population-based epidemiological studies thus far, we aimed to investigate the prospective association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the risk of developing hepatic steatosis among adults without clinically manifest hepatic steatosis. We hypothesised that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet would reduce the risk of hepatic steatosis. ",7b85d3a2-9c78-4cc2-ae88-085a1095c985
3,methods0,"Study population We evaluated participants in the CoLaus Study, an ongoing population-based cohort investigating the clinical, biological and genetic determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the city of Lausanne, Switzerland.29 Inclusion criteria of the recruitment were adults of European origin, aged 35–75 years.29 There were three study phases: baseline recruitment in 2003–2006 (n=6733), the first follow-up in 2009–2012 (n=5064) and the second follow-up in 2014–2017 (n=4881). We conducted dietary assessment at the first follow-up and therefore considered the first follow-up as the study baseline. Fatty Liver Index (Fatty Liver Index (FLI)) and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) score, two indices of hepatic steatosis, were available at baseline.27 If participants met the joint criterion of Fatty Liver Index (FLI) ≥60 or non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) score ≥−0.640 at baseline, we excluded them as prevalent cases (see below) (n=2036).",02f5d63e-c02c-4345-b76f-c6336cd69f7e

The resulting Mediterranean diet score (MDS) ranges between 0 and 15 on a continuous scale. The Mediterranean diet score (MDS) calculation was adjusted to an energy intake of 2000 kcal/d (8.37 MJ/day) by applying a regression-residual technique for energy adjustment to each food group variable.33 34  Ascertainment of hepatic steatosis Two indices of hepatic steatosis were evaluated: Fatty Liver Index (FLI)35 and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) liver fat score.",527ad7df-5482-4096-be55-f97a4ae25be0

These findings agree with previous studies26 28 44 45 including the Framingham Heart Study suggesting benefits of low consumption of red meat and high consumption of fruits or whole grains28; and a cross-sectional analysis from the PREDIMED Study suggesting the benefit of low consumption of red meat.",02ab6841-ac7b-4269-9feb-b651887a7eb8
36,discussion7,"26 Moreover, the Mediterranean diet is characterised by a moderate-to-high consumption of whole grains, which has been inversely associated with the likelihood of having non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).46  Possible mechanisms and implications Hepatic steatosis is associated with a number of metabolic risk factors including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome and oxidative stress.47 Mediterranean diet-associated phenolic compounds (phenolic acids and polyphenols) found in fruits and vegetables and high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids of olive oil have been shown to inhibit de novo lipogenesis, improve peripheral insulin sensitivity, and reduced cardiovascular risk mainly due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects.",4571e56b-5db0-42b9-b73c-722c6eab4dc6
37,discussion8,"18 48–51 Moreover, different components of the Mediterranean diet, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)), fibre and antioxidant rich-foods are inversely associated with hepatic steatosis.52 53 One meta-analysis of interventional studies reported that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were negatively associated with hepatic steatosis.54 The Mediterranean diet is also low in saturated fat, which has been demonstrated to increase hepatic triglycerides content and hepatic insulin resistance.55 56 Finally, the high-fibre content of the Mediterranean diet has been associated with reduced hepatic fat.18 52  Hepatic steatosis is associated with cardiometabolic diseases and substantially impacts public health.",6f7e6eef-8581-4682-b2fc-7998e5090102
38,discussion9,"13 15 16 Thus, our finding of an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and risk of hepatic steatosis would support the importance of dietary advice for the prevention of hepatic steatosis as well as its treatment. However, future work should confirm whether or not the clinical importance of the Mediterranean diet for the prevention of hepatic steatosis is independent of obesity or central adiposity.  Strengths and limitations To our knowledge, this is the first European prospective study assessing the association between the Mediterranean diet and risk of hepatic steatosis. The study had the benefit of a relatively large sample size and an average of 5.3 years of follow-up, and applied a definition of the Mediterranean diet that has been shown to be valid in a non-Mediterranean population.33  Several limitations of this study merit consideration.",cd5e3133-8181-4752-86b0-c31d1596aad1
39,discussion10," Measurement error and recall bias are inevitable when using self-reported dietary instruments, limiting the ability to precisely measure adherence to the Mediterranean diet, although adjustment for energy intake may have reduced the magnitude of measurement error.57 We used diet data measured only at baseline but recognised that intraindividual variation over time might be present which would be expected to weaken the observed associations, and hence our findings may be biased towards the null. However, in CoLaus, average change in estimated total energy intake from first to second follow-up was 51 kcal/day and changes for each macronutrient (expressed as % of total energy intake) were about 1% (data not shown). Thus, dietary intake in CoLaus was relatively stable, suggesting that the lack of availability of repeat dietary measures is unlikely to alter our findings substantially.",3332c3e9-9c4f-434a-bccb-7ed3300ebcf9
40,discussion11,"  Our ascertainment of hepatic steatosis was based on two indices, but not on liver biopsy or direct imaging assessment; hence, information bias (misdiagnosis) cannot be ruled out. Although liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing hepatic steatosis, its use in apparently healthy participants would be unethical and unfeasible in a large population-based study. Further, previous studies have shown that Fatty Liver Index (FLI) and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) score can accurately identify hepatic steatosis with good sensitivity and specificity, and these scores have been validated for use in large epidemiological studies.36 37 58 59 But, although both Fatty Liver Index (FLI) and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) score can indicate hepatic steatosis, their precision is variable.",aa799e7d-6d8b-4522-96ad-3352fe983c5b
41,discussion12,"60 Moreover, presence of steatohepatitis or advanced liver fibrosis could influence the relationship of Fatty Liver Index (FLI) or non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) score with hepatic steatosis.61 Of note, our study was not designed to assess the role of adherence to the Mediterranean diet in hepatic fibrosis.  Although we adjusted for many relevant confounders and performed a series of sensitivity analyses, we cannot rule out residual confounding due to unmeasured variables or covariates measured with error. On the other hand, our adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference as markers of general and central adiposity may potentially be an overadjustment if adiposity is on the causal pathway between dietary adherence and hepatic steatosis.",799baf20-39d9-4a08-b06b-78232a653f86
42,discussion13," However, since Fatty Liver Index (FLI) may approximate hepatic steatosis with a degree of imprecision, adjusting for adiposity in these analyses may not represent adjusting the association between diet and steatosis directly, but through an HSI that already includes adiposity measures in its definition. Nevertheless, our analytical approach is comprehensive, showing the results for crude analyses, followed by multivariable adjustment without and with further adjustment for adiposity markers. Future research with repeat measurements should further investigate this issue. Generalisability of our findings is limited because included participants seemed to be healthier than those excluded, and our findings were obtained in a single European population. Still, they confirm the findings from a previous prospective study conducted in the USA28 and might serve as a reference for other studies.",1fccb300-8e2f-4575-b004-41613df378cb
43,discussion14,"  Conclusion Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was inversely associated with risk of hepatic steatosis based on the Fatty Liver Index (FLI), and the association was independent of several known risk factors. Conversely, the association was not observed when using different criteria specifying the non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) score. These findings support recommendations on following the Mediterranean diet for hepatic steatosis prevention in addition to the existing evidence for its benefit for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Nonetheless, the findings also highlight the need for further research with more accurate measures of hepatic steatosis to replicate these findings in different populations and settings.
