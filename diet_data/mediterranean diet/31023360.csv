0,methods0,"2.1. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) Samples The study analyzed a total of 92 samples of Italian and foreign extra virgin olive oil (Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) owing to different cultivars, monovarietal (65) and blend (27), produced in two harvest years (2018 and 2019) (Figure 1).  The tested samples were bought from large retailers and directly from mills. Some samples were acquired specifically from the mills of the areas of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily to ensure their origin. Other samples were sent, on a voluntary base, directly by the producers willing to participate in the research.  2.2. The Open Source IoT Spectrometer The analyzed samples were stored and kept during the analyses at a controlled temperature of 16 °C. The samples, owing to the 2018 harvest campaign, were analyzed between March and May 2019 while those produced in the 2019 harvest campaign were analyzed between February and March 2020.",a8a5e967-e34f-4dce-864e-5b32197e97af
1,methods1," The samples were scanned with a VIS-NIR spectrometer measuring and acquiring the spectral reflectance signatures for the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) samples for consequent qualitative evaluation. From each oil container (bottle or can) of the same sample, 12 spectral readings were acquired and afterwards averaged. The device used was the ultra-compact VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Figure 2) Lumini C (Myspectral Ltd., Cambridge, MA, USA), able to measure spectral reflectance or absorbance. The device is small, light, low-cost, and open source. The spectral ranges covered 340–890 nm with an optical resolution equal to 8 nm and wavelength accuracy equal to 0.5 nm. The spectrophotometer is powered through a USB cable and stores data on connected cabled devices or on an internal micro SD card using a dedicated slot. For appropriate acquisition of the spectral signature, in relation to the sample reflectance characteristics, the acquisition can be set at different integration times.",8bd13260-8194-4ad5-9bac-f977c559e4e5
2,methods2," The system is equipped with its own internal illumination system.  A specific app was developed to manage and simplify the acquisition procedures. The software provided with the spectrophotometer, as commonly happens with open source technologies, was quite poor in terms of features and did not originally provide an appropriate historicization system for multiple acquisitions. For this reason, an app was developed and implemented. A screenshot of the app is reported in Figure 3.  The app was engineered considering two kinds of functions. The first (upper side of Figure 3) enables the configuration parameters of the instrument, such as the IP address, to connect the tablet to the device, the type of tool (in this case is Lumini C), the exposure time expressed in milliseconds (ms), and the sample’s name to be archived. The second (lower side of Figure 3), graphically represents the acquired spectrum for each scan.",f4b07df6-185f-48dc-b03c-ef6d4314f44b
3,methods3," When a new sample name is entered, the graphic area is reset, ready to display the new spectra. This helps in case of incomplete or bad acquisition since it avoided losing samples’ values during the acquisition campaign. The app was developed using the Android environment and it is based on a client-server paradigm; on the client side there is the app, and on the server side there is the database for real-time storage of the spectrum and the node.js server to which the Lumini C is connected (Figure 4). The app software implements control mechanisms for the data stored on the database; these are essential since the data stored originally onboard within a microSD are now stored to a remote database. Through this mechanism, the data loss is minimized. In case of communication problems among the devices, the app notifies the problem and does not display the spectrum just acquired, allowing for a new scanning process.  2.3.",d835471b-797b-4465-85d1-bf34f9365bdc
4,methods4," Statistical Analysis The multivariate matrix of Italian and foreign Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) samples was analyzed with a 50–50 multivariate analysis of variance (multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)) procedure [38], a generalized multivariate Anova method based on principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) standardized data. The multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted in order to highlight significant differences between Italian and foreign VIS-NIR matrices. Adjusted p-values were conducted on a rotation testing based on 99,999 simulated datasets. The contribution of the variables was extracted for each rotation test [39].  An artificial intelligence approach was then applied in order to evaluate the possibility to classify Italian Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s and distinguish them from the foreign ones on the base of the 288 spectral transmittance values acquired through the VIS-NIR device.",a86c40d3-1ca4-4b6a-8c21-3fe7f75d07cc
5,methods5," To do this, a multilayer feed forward artificial neural network (multilayer feed forward artificial neural network (MLFN)) was designed using a single hidden layer architecture with sigmoid hidden and SoftMax output neurons. The artificial neural network (ANN) was trained with the Bayesian regularization back propagation algorithm [40,41], as implemented in the deep learning MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., MA, USA) toolbox. The dataset was partitioned using 60 percent of the samples (55) as a training set and the rest as a test set (37). The test set was used to validate the model. This partitioning (equal for each soil group) was optimally chosen with the Euclidean distances calculated by the algorithm reported by Kennard and Stone [42], selecting parameters without a priori knowledge of a regression model. The cost function was minimized using the root mean squared (root mean squared (RMS)) normalized error performance function with a 10−8 threshold on the gradient.",fdc0659a-6031-4060-b228-9457b99d83df
6,methods6," In order to extract the most informative spectral transmittance values among the 288 acquired, in distinguishing Italian Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) from foreign ones, it also conducted an analysis to study the feature importance. The hidden layer matrix (10 nodes × 288 variables) was a posteriori analyzed considering its elementwise absolute value. From the matrix was extracted the maximum value for each variable (e.g., column) obtaining a 1 × 288 row vector. The top 40 most significant spectral frequencies were chosen. The larger the value, the more relevant was the contribution to the artificial neural network (ANN) model. The model was developed using the MATLAB 9.7 R2019b Deep Learning Toolbox.  3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Artificial Intelligence Modeling Based on VIS-NIR Spectra The multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) (50–50 multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) procedure) reported significant differences (p < 0.",89085dad-c79a-43af-b2cf-715e491a93c8
7,methods7,"001) between the two Italian and foreign Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) VIS-NIR matrices. The results of the analysis are reported in Table 1.  The artificial neural network (ANN) trained had a hidden layer size of 10 nodes and the algorithm converged after 976 iterations. Table 2 reports the characteristics and principal results of the artificial neural network (ANN) model used to predict Italian vs. foreign Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on the base of 288 VIS-NIR spectral transmittance data. All the 55 Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s in the training set were correctly classified. In testing, only five out of 37 samples were misclassified. These five samples consisted of two Italian commercial monocultivars (Coratina from Apulia and Taggiasca from Liguria) and three foreign blends from Greece, Argentina, and Croatia. Overall, 87 out of 92 samples (94.6%) were correctly classified.  The confusion matrix of the test set is reported in Table 3.",25551058-740e-45a8-9eb5-a84162eb8b4a
8,methods8,"  Overall, VIS-NIR spectroscopy analyses showed significant differences between Italian and foreign samples. From the results obtained through the artificial neural network (ANN) analysis, only five samples out of 37 were misclassified, e.g., two Italian commercial monocultivars (Coratina from Apulia and Taggiasca from Liguria) and three foreign blends (from Greece, Argentina, and Croatia). Probably, the two Italian samples were misclassified because of their uncertain geographical origin, considering that they are commercial oils. All the samples bought directly from the mills (noncommercial) were correctly classified. The off diagonal elements of the test confusion matrix (Table 3) are reported in Table 4.  Generally, machine learning relies on the amount of data for good modeling, where more data correspond to a modeling approach with increased robustness and performance.",e8bde80e-7829-4488-ac37-c7a41d531520
9,methods9," For this reason, even if the overall accuracy of the model is almost 90% and the convergence threshold of 10-8 on the root mean squared (RMS) error gradient is very strict, the small size of the dataset (made of 92 samples) is not enough to validate the model. On the other hand, the high accuracy obtained despite the small dataset returns the reliability of the correlation observed [43].  The present work considered 67 Italian Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s and 25 foreign ones (two harvesting years: 2018 and 2019). However, it must be considered that other work using different methods to authenticate Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) geographical origin were developed using a number of samples comparable and sometimes lower than that presented in this work. As reported by Bucci et al.",38cbc556-78fa-45c1-8fc8-76fe4adac021
10,methods10," [44], the data set for the statistical analysis was constructed on the results of the chemical analyses performed on 153 Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s (years of harvesting: 1997–1999), but finally only the samples produced in 1999 (53 oils) were analyzed in the laboratory. In the work conducted by Portarena et al. [45], they analyzed the isotopic composition and carotenoid content of 38 Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s from seven regions along the Italian coast using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Iroot mean squared (RMS)) and resonance Raman spectroscopy (resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS)). The correlation between color and pigment content is well known in the literature [46]: the crushing of very green olives produces a typical green colored oil due to the high content in chlorophyll; if olives are more mature, carotenoids will prevail, determining a yellow-gold colored oil.",0d71969e-d3bd-4461-bb49-4d7cfdab3867
11,methods11," Additionally, as the maturation progresses, the content and profile of phenolic compounds will also be affected: crushing green olives will result in an oil characterized by a higher content of phenolic acids, phenolic alcohols, oleuropein, and secoiridoids, whereas oils produced with dark brown olives will have a high content of anthocyanins, water-soluble plant pigments that take on different colors: red, blue, or violet [47,48].  3.2. Feature Importance Observing the top 40 multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) rotation test’s most important variables (e.g., spectral lengths), the most informative ones ranged within the following frequencies: 308–373 nm, 594–612 nm, and 617–641 nm. The average VIS-NIR spectral data of foreign and Italian Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s are reported in Figure 5 together with the higher importance spectral values extracted with the aforementioned multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) rotation test.",97d40ca4-9c18-496e-afdd-0babdf7397f4
12,methods12,"  Consequently, the 40 most important features extracted through the artificial neural network (ANN) procedure (e.g., spectral lengths), ranged within the following frequencies: 308–378 nm, 415–422 nm, 474–507 nm, 564–570 nm, and 596–605 nm. The average VIS-NIR spectral data of both Italian and foreign samples, together with the higher importance spectral values in terms of artificial neural network (ANN) feature importance, are reported in Figure 6.  The two feature importance approaches, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and artificial neural network (ANN), evidenced common ranges of higher importance, which were: 308–373 nm and 594–605 nm. These spectral bands represent portions of the visible spectral range. The color of an oil is, therefore, due to the combination and proportion of its pigments [49]. These molecules do not depend only on the characteristics of the fruits (Olea europaea L.",a44f5291-3e85-401e-93ad-2927274093fd
13,methods13,"), the extraction processes used to produce the oil, and the conservation conditions [50] but, also, on weather and pedo-climate conditions [51]. Therefore, the relationship between the stage of ripeness and pigment content in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) could be, indeed, very important for further authentication studies [52].  The molecular structure of chlorophylls and, in particular, the planar structure of the tetrapyrrolic macrocycle coordinated by a magnesium ion, Mg++, is responsible for the absorption of visible light in the green region. Chlorophyll a gives a greenish-blue coloration, while chlorophyll b determines a yellowish-green color. The sensitivity of chlorophylls to extreme temperature and pH allows the formation of several distinct derivatives such as pheophytins, chlorophyllides, and pheophorbides. During the olive oil extraction process, the release of acids may cause pheophytinization reactions in the chlorophyll fraction, increasing the oils’ pheophytin content.",b7fc7c68-1086-4a79-a1cb-771c63a3981d
14,methods14," The conversion of chlorophylls to Mg2+ free derivatives, such as pheophytins, where the Mg++ ion is replaced by two H+ ions, causes oil color changes over time [53,54,55]. Pheophytin a is present in greater quantities than pheophytin b. If olive oil is not well preserved, pheophytins can transform further, degrading to pyro pheophytin [55]. These latter can be considered an index of an aging oil. In addition to chlorophyll derivatives, pigments in extra virgin olive oil include carotenoids, the majority of which are lutein and carotene. Carotenoids are isoprenoid compounds with a hydrocarbon structure with various double bonds, C–C, which are responsible for their interesting properties as antioxidants [56]. Carotenoids can be further divided into carotenes (which contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms) and xanthophylls (which also contain oxygen atoms).  The spectra of olive oils analyzed in this work agree with those reported in the literature [57,58,59,60,61].",e4a9eccf-cb0e-4b27-b177-9a8b653d6ab5
15,methods15,"  The peaks occurring in the range between 308 and 380 nm are mostly due to phenolic components [62]. In detail, we found the peak at around 350 nm, the absorption zone of flavones, present in the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) absorbance spectrum useful to distinguish Italian Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s from foreign ones. Flavonoids are plant secondary metabolites with different phenolic structures. These compounds are mostly used to generate pigments, which play an important role in the colors of plants producing yellow or red/blue pigmentation. Flavonoids such as apigenin, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, luteolin, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, luteolin-4-O-glucoside, diosmetin, quercetin, and quercetin-3-rutinoside are present in olive oils and contribute to the health benefits of consumers. The antioxidant and cellular damage repairing properties that make them useful for preventing cancer, cardiovascular disease, and degenerative diseases in general have been widely studied [63].",36024288-2636-4a51-b165-0af54ff11214
16,methods16," The main factors that contribute to their increase in the oil is the maturity index of the fruits and the degree of grinding and the malaxation conditions of the paste during the extraction processes of the oil [64].  The peaks occurring in the range between 415 and 422 nm are due to the compounds absorbing dark blue colored light, mainly carotenoids, as well as pheophytin a, pheophorbide a, and pyro pheophytin a [59], and are characterized by a yellow color.  The peaks occurring in the range between 474 and 507 nm are due to the compounds absorbing green/yellow colored light, and correspond to carotenoids, such as astaxanthin and canthaxanthin. In any case, the major carotenoids in olive oil are β-carotene and lutein, both of them providing several health benefits. Lutein exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity protecting against DNA damage [65].",6287dc15-97e4-4989-982b-3c0eb5ca2a8b
17,methods17,"  Moreover, the peaks occurring in the range between 564 and 570 nm and between 594 and 605 nm are due to the compounds absorbing orange colored light, characterized by purple/violet and green/blue colors, respectively, and corresponding to chlorophylls and anthocyanins.  4. Conclusions Spectroscopic techniques paired to chemometric analyses are widely used to authenticate and differentiate edible oils. Most spectroscopic methods tend to focus on the major compounds of the saponifiable fraction of an oil, and only a few have been concentrating on the contents of minor compounds, such as pigments and antioxidants. The European community has not yet accepted many of the scientific community’s indications concerning minor compounds, which, by law, are not taken into consideration for the definition of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s’ authenticity.",8dede345-efc1-46e1-9e24-893ec3b0eca8
18,methods18," However, many of the minor compounds are present in significant amounts only in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)s, and their quantification could greatly help the oil industry. Although further analysis will be needed to expand the case studies on olive oils, this work provides a clear indication of how pigment and antioxidant contents are crucial for the authentication and definition of the quality parameters of an Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). In detail, we found that the peak at about 360 nm and the broad band around 550 nm present in the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) absorbance spectrum can be used to distinguish Italian Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) from foreign ones. As opposite to expensive and time-consuming chromatographic methods, procedures relying on (open source) spectroscopic instruments are cheap (less than 1000 €) and do not require sample preprocessing. Moreover, being fast, these techniques can be used to assess a huge collection of samples within a reasonable time.",d7ff7c8f-8a76-4b94-b12b-5d4de93526da
19,methods19," The quantitative analysis of pigments can take place directly at production sites and stores, through portable tools that are easy to use, even by non-expert staff. The trained artificial neural network (ANN) used to classify the samples according to their optical spectra can be easily implemented on an app for immediate classification. The development of simple and reliable methods that can verify the authenticity and guarantee the quality of agri-food products is crucial. Encouragingly, this type of analysis would be very beneficial for the producers themselves as well as consumers. Indeed, these techniques can score comparable precision with respect to the more expensive and time-consuming traditional ones.",f68c2917-c1e5-4e4b-9afe-4f96bd2d9861
20,methods20," Moreover, since their application cost relies entirely on the instrumental budget, and not on reagent or other expensive consumable materials, they can be applied to a high number of samples and thus, in case of supposed fraud, can be used as pre-screening tools leading to time and economic optimization.
