0,methods0," 2.1. Mouse Models  MMTV-PyMT (FVB/N-Tg (MMTV-PyMT) 634 Mul/J) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. MMTV-PyMT female mice were used for this study. Mice were maintained on regular chow until 8 weeks of age, at which time they were randomized to either a milk fat-based diet (milk fat based diet (MFBD), 42% of calories from fat, TD.088137), an olive oil-based diet (olive oil based diet (OOBD), 42% of calories from fat, TD.140589), or an isocaloric control diet (CD, 12.6% of calories from fat, TD.05230) purchased from Envigo, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN, USA). Animals were maintained under standard laboratory conditions, and all animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Stony Brook University (Stony Brook University (SBU)) and followed the guidelines of the American Veterinary Medical Association.  2.2. Tumor Monitoring  Tumor monitoring and measurements were performed as described in Velazquez et al. [25].",cdee023c-6cf7-465d-b018-1fa6d57dba40
1,methods1," The area of the lung metastases were calculated through microscopy (EVOS M500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).  2.3. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-Time PCR  RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR in tumor tissues were performed as described in Choi et al. [26]. The following TaqMan probes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used: mouse S1PR1 (ID: Mm02619656_s1), mouse TNFα (ID: Mm00443260_g1), mouse MMP9 (ID: Mm00442991_m1), and mouse β-actin (ID: Mm02619580_g1). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained for each gene of interest and normalized to the β-actin.  2.4. Statistical Analysis  Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Data are mean ± S.E.M. and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with a Dunn’s Multiple Comparison Test or by an unpaired Student’s t-test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  3.

2,methods2," Milk Fat and Olive Oil Diets Do Not Alter Tumor Weight or Volume in MMTV-PyMT Mice  Obesity and diets high in fat have been shown to have a significant impact on the prognosis and survival in breast cancer patients [27,28]. To begin to define the impact of diets enriched with specific dietary fatty acids on breast cancer, we used female MMTV-PyMT mice, which present with high tumor incidence and metastases rates [29,30]. These mice provide more rapid and predictable metastases that develop in the lung and lymph nodes. Female MMTV-PyMT mice were fed a milk fat based diet (MFBD), olive oil based diet (OOBD), or CD starting at 8 weeks of age. Body weight and tumor measurements were collected every two weeks, and the mice were euthanized at 16 weeks (Figure 1A). From 10 to 16 weeks, the body weights were similar among all diets including the CD (Figure 1B).",dbe4f704-190c-40a7-a2ee-194565a07e3e
3,methods3," Mice fed milk fat based diet (MFBD) and olive oil based diet (OOBD) exhibited no difference in tumor weight or final tumor volume from CD fed mice at 16 weeks (Figure 1C–E). Importantly, CD fed mice exhibited similar tumor growth to MMTV-PyMT mice who were fed a standard regular chow diet (data not shown). These data suggest that a milk fat based diet (MFBD) nor an olive oil based diet (OOBD) alter primary tumor size or tumor weight in the MMTV-PyMT model.  3.2. milk fat based diet (MFBD) Fed Mice Exhibit Increased Lung Metastasis in MMTV-PyMT Mice  high fat diet (HFD)s have been implicated in metastasis and inflammation in MMTV-PyMT mice [31]. Therefore, in order to determine if the milk fat based diet (MFBD) or olive oil based diet (OOBD) altered lung metastases in the MMTV-PyMT mice, lungs were harvested at 16 weeks and assessed for metastases (Figure 2A). The number of surface nodules were significantly higher in mice who were fed the milk fat based diet (MFBD) (13.20 ± 5.",f4737c9a-f5ce-4658-b9b5-db285e2f086b

Moreover, the area for the lung metastases from olive oil based diet (OOBD) (average: 0.52 × 105 µm2 ± 0.83 × 104) was significantly smaller when compared to the CD (average: 1.30 × 105 µm2 ± 2.34 × 104) or the milk fat based diet (MFBD) (average: 1.21 × 105 µm2 ± 2.79 × 104) mice (Figure 2C). Large tumors (>0.1 mm2) were present in 23% of the CD and MFD mice, but in only 10% of the olive oil based diet (OOBD) mice, indicating mice fed the olive oil based diet (OOBD) exhibited smaller metastases (Figure 2D). These results indicate that while the milk fat based diet (MFBD) does not increase primary tumor growth, this diet results in increased lung metastasis in the MMTV-PyMT model.  3.3.",26992082-47c0-4a25-a4cc-f43a72008ea5
5,methods5," milk fat based diet (MFBD) Increases TNFα Expression in Primary Tumors  Many factors influence primary tumor growth and overall metastatic potential including VEGF, HIF1α, and FGF as well as many cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, we next investigated the effects of enriched high fat diet (HFD)s on the signaling pathways and inflammation in the tumor. Using a RT-PCR array, we surveyed 42 growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines that have been implicated in tumor growth, inflammation, and metastases (Table S1). From the array, several MMPs, cytokines, and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) were of particular interest. Upon validation, primary tumor tissues from the milk fat based diet (MFBD) mice exhibited significant increases in TNFα expression compared to tumors from the olive oil based diet (OOBD) fed mice as well as increased an expression of S1PR1 and MMP9; however, these were not statistically significant (Figure 3).",3c73f04d-b9cc-4c84-abac-578719ecbe89
6,methods6," These cytokines suggested the potential for a more inflammatory tumor micro-environment in mice fed a milk fat based diet (MFBD) than an olive oil based diet (OOBD).  4. Discussion  The present study demonstrates that two different types of high fat diet (HFD)s do not affect tumor latency or primary tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT model compared to an isocaloric control diet. However, mice fed an olive oil based diet (OOBD) exhibited decreases in the number of lung metastases (assessed by surface nodules) compared mice fed a milk fat based diet (MFBD). Additionally, olive oil based diet (OOBD) fed mice exhibited a decreased area of lung metastasis compared to the CD and milk fat based diet (MFBD) mice. These results suggest that different types of high fat diet (HFD)s could have a differential effect on breast cancer progression without affecting primary tumor growth.",edad1df5-85f4-46a1-8395-b892bf467fe9
7,methods7,"  The absence of differences in tumor latency and primary tumor growth contradicts previous studies in the MMTV-PyMT model where a high fat diet (HFD) prolonged [21] or shortened [32] tumor latency and increased tumor growth [20,21,32]. One of the reasons for these observed discrepancies could be the age when the diet was started in the female mice. MMTV-PyMT mice are a fast-progressing model with mammary lesions starting as early 4 weeks of age and signs of early malignant transition at 8 weeks of age [30]. The present work analyzed tumor progression in mice fed either a CD, a milk fat based diet (MFBD), or an olive oil based diet (OOBD) from 8–16 weeks of age, while the previous reports that show an effect on primary tumor growth started at 3–4 weeks of age [20,21,32]. Additionally, we did not observe an increase in weight gain in female mice fed with either milk fat based diet (MFBD) or olive oil based diet (OOBD) compared to the CD.",b8c543bd-e0e0-4c27-a432-4a0d72d50196
8,methods8," This is somewhat not surprising as the FVB background strain has been shown to be resistant to diet induced obesity [23,24]. In a study by Hu et al., FVB mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks did not exhibit changes in body weight, metabolic rate, or the expression of nutrient-sensitive genes [24]. In fact, ovariectomized FVB mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) at 8 weeks of age for 13 weeks and injected with MMTV-PyMT tumor derived cells did not show differences in tumor growth as well as in body weight [33]. These results suggest that in the lack of obesity, a high-fat diet alone does not modify primary tumor growth.  The higher levels of TNFα expression in the primary tumor tissues from milk fat based diet (MFBD) mice compared to olive oil based diet (OOBD) and CD mice could play role in the differences observed in metastasis. The increase of TNFα and additional cytokines have been previously reported in mammary tumors from MMTV-PyMT mice fed with a high fat diet (HFD) [21].",059cfc6f-e522-4a64-8b1c-26d35fe312a0
9,methods9," TNFα has been shown to induce epithelial–mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cell lines [34,35], and it has been suggested as a prognostic marker for human breast cancer progression [36,37]. Interleukin-6 (IL6) has also been implicated in mammary tumors from mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) [38] and in tumor cell lines derived from MMTV-K-Ras mice [39]. Due to the significance of the local immune environment in breast cancer progression [40], with findings that also show its role in the MMTV-PyMT model [41], additional studies on the tumor microenvironment and inflammatory cytokines could help to elucidate mechanisms contributing to the observed differences in metastases.  Additional factors from the diet used in the present study could also play a role in the results observed. For example, it has been shown that high fat diet (HFD) caused hyperinsulinemia when compared to a control diet [42].",0f38c0e7-d7ea-4c31-b68c-c2e090c4f46c
10,methods10," Insulin could affect cell growth and alter the invasiveness of breast cancer cells [43], and insulin resistance has been shown to be associated with increased breast cancer risk [44]. The milk fat based diet (MFBD) and olive oil based diet (OOBD) used in this work have similar calories from carbohydrates (43.7% Kcal and 43% Kcal, respectively) and their percentages are lower than in the CD (68.5% Kcal). Plasma insulin levels or an additional low carbohydrate diet could lend insight into the role of insulin and insulin resistance in tumor formation and metastasis in high fat diet (HFD) models.  Studies over the last 20 years have associated a Mediterranean diet (MD), which is typically associated with consumption of olive oil, with lower breast cancer incidence in humans across several different study populations [45,46,47,48]. When compared to a Western diet (WD) it has been suggested that the MD could be preventive in the development of breast cancer [49].",0724ab65-aef6-41e0-8360-52657ee50018
11,methods11," However, a study examining the effects of a MD in France demonstrated no association between breast cancer risk and MD [50]. The PREDIMED study uncovered associations of decreased breast cancer risk in women that consumed a MD with extra virgin olive oil when compared to a MD with nuts or an advised low-fat control diet [51]. Our studies found no difference in overall tumor growth or progression among the milk fat based diet (MFBD), the olive oil based diet (OOBD), or CD. Future studies should be geared at examining additional sources of dietary fatty acids on initial tumor growth and progression, as this could lend important insight into sources of dietary fats to examine in future clinical studies.",1cc55e28-83ca-4088-ae65-f64043d3788a
12,methods12,"  Analysis of lung metastasis in mice fed the olive oil based diet (OOBD) demonstrated a significant reduction in the average area of lung metastasis compared to the CD and milk fat based diet (MFBD), while comparison between the two high fat diet (HFD)s indicated that the olive oil based diet (OOBD) decreased the number of surface nodes compared to the milk fat based diet (MFBD). Previous reports have shown increased primary tumor growth and metastases in MMTV-PyMT mice fed either a soybean oil based high fat diet (HFD) [21,22] or a lard based high fat diet (HFD) [30] compared to a control or standard chow diet. Conversely, a study by Cowen et al. demonstrated higher tumor volume but not increased lung metastases in MMTV-PyMT mice fed a lard based high fat diet (HFD) compared to a low-calorie control diet [20].",67b479b4-810c-457f-998c-a609229e9ceb
13,methods13," These studies demonstrate the importance of an isocaloric control diet and the use of two or more fat sources for investigations into the effects of a specific high fat diet (HFD) on breast cancer development and metastasis. Our study is the first study reporting a positive effect of a specific type of high fat diet (HFD), olive oil based diet (OOBD) vs. milk fat based diet (MFBD), on breast cancer progression in MMTV-PyMT mice by decreasing the area of lung metastasis. Future studies will be geared at defining the mechanisms by which specific dietary fatty acids in high fat diet (HFD)s alter metastasis and breast cancer development.
