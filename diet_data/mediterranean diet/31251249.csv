Study Design and Samples The data used in this manuscript were obtained as part of the EsNuPI study, which was a prospective, cross-sectional, observational study, conducted from October 2018 to January 2019. The complete design, protocol, and methodology of the EsNuPI study were described in detail elsewhere [21]. Briefly, the EsNuPI study evaluated the dietary and nutrient intake and dietary patterns, as well as physical activity and sedentary behaviors of non-vegan Spanish children, living in urban areas, distributed in nine regions according to Nielsen Spanish areas. Nielsen geographical distribution of the sample for the EsNuPI study: area 1 (9.8%), northeast; area 2 (12.6%), Levant (east); area 3 (15.1%), south; area 4 (7.6%), central; area 5 (11.9%), northwest; area 6 (8.6%), north central; area 7 (9.4%), metropolitan area of Barcelona; area 8 (19.0%), metropolitan area of Madrid; and area 9 (6.0%), Canary Islands [21].",4a97980d-24ee-4c17-9246-19a3bf703d1c
1,methods1,"  Two subsamples were selected, one SRS and one adapted milk consumers (AMS) both from 1 to <10 years old. The adapted milk consumers (AMS) regularly consumed follow-on formula, toddler’s milk, fortified or enriched milk depending of the specific children age. All these formulas are usually formulated with a partial replacement of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) from milk fat with unsaturated fatty acids (FAs), from vegetable oils and added with selected nutrients, namely calcium, iron, vitamin D, and docosahexaenoic acid (from marine oil) depending on the specific age of the child. The reasons for choosing the adapted milk consumers (AMS) and SRS cohorts are described elsewhere [21].  A total of 1514 children agreed to participate in the study and completed the face-to-face interview. The EsNuPI study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the University of Granada ethical committee (No. 659/CEIH/2018) and registered in ClinicalTrials.",2a014098-17e5-4a04-b9a0-e6c0fba8bf58
2,methods2,"gov (Unique Protocol ID: FF01/2019).  2.1.1. Dietary Survey and Data Collection For our study, a food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) was used that was previously modified, adapted, and validated with the portion sizes and food groups usually consumed by the Spanish child population [39]. This food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was a quantitative one, and participants answered questions regarding their child’s usual food consumption over the last 12 months, structured by 10 food groups and including 251 different foods including the foods and beverages most commonly consumed by the Spanish population [21,39,40]. Then, these 10 groups were divided into 18 groups due to the wide diversity of food products currently available.",4ec6befc-4f67-4014-906d-bca26442ef98
3,methods3," The main food groups considered in this study were as follows: “milk and dairy products”, “cereals”, “meat and meat products”, “oils and fats”, “bakery and pastry”, “fruits”, “vegetables”, “sugars and sweets”, “ready to cook” (is industrial pre-cooked foods prepared with the expectation they will be heated/cooked by frying, microwave, oven, stovetop (e.g., frozen pizza, frozen vegetables, etc.) or baking), “other dairy products”, “beverages”, “legumes”, “eggs”, “fish and shellfish”, “appetizers”, “cereal-based baby foods”, “nuts”, and “sauces and condiments” [41].  2.1.2. Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire The physical activity and sedentary behaviors questionnaire used for this study was a modification of a questionnaire previously validated in children aged <10 years from Colombia based on a seven-day recall [42]. Some modifications, mostly in commonly used language terms, were made to this questionnaire to adapt it to the needs of the present study.",d89a67e5-2612-4e10-abf2-b70bb0cdab1c
4,methods4,"  The questionnaire provided information on the physical activity and sedentary behaviors in children under 10 years of age. Furthermore, we adjusted the questionnaire to the Spanish most common terms of different activities. The detailed protocol has been reported elsewhere [21]. In brief, physical activity was reported indicating all the activities performed by the child in one day (24 h) during the last week (a seven-day record), including hours of sleep and screen time, and was reported separately for weekdays and weekends [21]. This questionnaire included activities that require more effort (cycling, walking, dancing, jumping, etc.) and activities that require little or no effort (reading time/homework, hours spent watching television, time spent using the computer and game consoles or screens, foreign language classes, music or drawing courses). Participants could list other activities that were not included in the other sections.",6cf390e0-f10f-402f-ac40-97ed81b433ea
5,methods5," Sleeping and eating habits included the number of hours each child slept per night and duration of naps, as well as the number of hours eating, on average, and they were reported separately for weekdays and weekends.  Finally, the calculations of energy cost were based on the metabolic equivalents (METy) value from the Youth Compendium, a measured or computed basal metabolic rate (basal metabolic rate (BMR)), and the duration of each specific activity, as follows:  Energy cost (kcal) = METy × basal metabolic rate (BMR) (kcal/min) × duration (minutes), where the basal metabolic rate (BMR) for boys and girls was predicted using specific Schofield equations [43,44,45]. Physical activity level (Physical activity level (PAL)) was calculated using the mean 24 h total energy expenditure (total energy expenditure (TEE)) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) in the following equation: Physical activity level (PAL) = total energy expenditure (TEE)/basal metabolic rate (BMR).",e948f2e7-1ce2-4a64-9b0a-5ae5a5600194

Anthropometric Data Weight and size data were reported by parents or caregivers based on the latest child’s health card. The weight and height of the children were evaluated using the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) international growth patterns based on the analysis of the body mass index (body mass index (BMI))-for-age indicators. For each child, the z-score index was estimated using World Health Organization (WHO) Anthro and World Health Organization (WHO) Anthro PLUS software (Version 3.2.2, January 2011).  2.1.4.

Household income (HI) Household income (HI) was classified based on occupation (12 categories) according to the National Association of Opinion and Market Research (and Market Research (ANEIMO)) criteria, which were adapted to the Spanish context using the World Association for Market, Social and Opinion Research (ESOMAR) criteria. After a preliminary analysis of the distribution of the variable for this analysis, the categories were collapsed and recoded into a 3-point scale as follows: (1) low, (2) mid-low, and (3) high (mid-mid, mid-high and high) HI levels [21].  2.2.",f201f301-2f90-4f4e-ac7d-58ec55ba21a9

Descriptive statistics were computed for each variable. All results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise indicated. p-values were obtained from H Kruskal–Wallis tests corrected by the Bonferroni post hoc test when age groups were compared for each sample. The chi-squared test was used to compare percentage differences for parental education and household income variables.  2.2.1. Dietary Patterns Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify underlying dietary patterns using the average weight consumed (g/day) by each individual from 18 food groups as input variables [39].",09e684b5-c6d3-4fb3-9af0-0aa234ec3ef3
9,methods9," Multicollinearity was evaluated by looking at the determinant of the R-matrix Bartlett’s test of sphericity, and the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO)) measure of sampling adequacy was used to verify the appropriateness of factor analysis. To assess the degree of intercorrelations between variables, we adopted a value >0.60 for the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO). Factors were orthogonally rotated (the Varimax option) to enhance the difference between loadings, which facilitated interpretability.  Factors were retained based on the following criteria: factor eigenvalue >1.2, identification of a breakpoint in the scree plot, the proportion of variance explained, and factor interpretability [26].  The strength and direction of the associations between patterns and food groups were described through a rotated factor loading matrix. Food groups with factor loadings >0.20 and communality >0.20 were retained in the patterns identified.",56bf4aad-dc19-4c76-9cff-2ce0a3375589
10,methods10," The factor score for each pattern was constructed by summing observed intakes of the component food items weighted by the factor loading. A high factor score for a given pattern indicated a high consumption of the foods constituting that food factor, and a low score indicated a low intake of those foods. Radar charts were used to display multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart of 18 food groups (input variables) represented on axes starting from the same point.  2.2.2. Lifestyle Patterns with Clustering Analysis A two-step cluster analysis procedure was used as an exploratory tool to reveal natural clusters within the dataset that would otherwise not be apparent and automatically determine the “best” number of clusters using SPSS v.25 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA).

The distance matrix was defined by Euclidean distances, and Ward’s method was used as linkage criteria to group the clusters. More specifically, based on the distance matrix, the clustering algorithm identified the closest observations (i.e., subjects with similar dietary and lifestyle behaviors, in rows) and iteratively merged them within the same cluster until all clusters were merged together. This clustering algorithm was applied separately within each age group. Three clusters were retained among subjects and lifestyle/dietary variables, which were assumed to be the optimum number of clusters (2 to 5 clusters were tested) based on the silhouette method (R package Nbclust).",9415fd99-4025-4294-9568-aa679a8e3630

Description of the Sample A total of 1512 children of the EsNuPI study sample whose parents or caregivers agreed to participate and completed the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (49.9% girls and 50.1% boys) were analyzed. The total SRS represented 48.9%, and the adapted milk consumers (AMS) 51.1%. The characteristics of both study samples are provided in Table 1. We did not exclude any participants based on potential misreporting of energy intake as energy intake for both the SRS and adapted milk consumers (AMS) cohorts were not significantly different from those of plausible reporters [21].  The food consumption divided according to the 18 food groups considered in the present study is shown in Table 2.",bdeddc71-8bfc-4343-af44-32472fe0f6ba

Consumption of bakery and pastry, vegetables, ready to cook, fish and shellfish, cereal-based baby foods, sauces and condiments, and nut consumption was significantly different in the three age groups (Table 2). While bakery and pastry, ready to cook, fish and shellfish, sauces and condiments, and nut consumption increased, the use of vegetables and cereal-based baby foods decreased. In adapted milk consumers (AMS), children from 3 to <6 and 6 to <10 years had an analogous consumption of milk and dairy products, cereals, meat and meat products, fruits, vegetables, and eggs in comparison with children aged 1 to <3 years.",fc24e4fa-f209-484a-a211-c60d63f610de

Bartlett’s tests of sphericity and Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) supported the appropriateness of factor analysis in both the SRS and adapted milk consumers (AMS) populations for the three different age groups. All Bartlett’s tests of sphericity were significant, and the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) value was >0.626 in all analyses. Three major factors were extracted through Principal component analysis (PCA) using the 18 food groups, as mentioned above, which explained from 37.56% to 51.26% of the variance in the six studied models (Table S1).

17,methods17,"  For the SRS, in children from 1 to <3 years, we observed three major factors or components: The first component (palatable energy-dense foods) had high positive loadings on sweetened dairy products, sugars and sweets, bakery and pastry, ready to cook, appetizers, beverages, sauces and condiments, and oils and fats, and negative loading on cereal-based baby foods. The second component (diverse plant and animal foods) was characterized by high positive loadings on cereals, vegetables, milk and dairy products, cereal-based baby foods, fruit, meat and meat products, and oils and fats. This pattern is close to the traditional Mediterranean diet pattern but with relatively high consumption of dairy and meat products. The third component (Mediterranean-like diet) had high positive loadings on nuts, fruits, legumes, cereals, fish and shellfish, and meat and meat products, and negative loading on milk and dairy products.",43945058-7220-4e01-8620-d6e415cacc09

Likewise, in children aged 6 to <10 years there were three major components; again, the first component was characterized as palatable energy-dense foods. The second component was defined as Mediterranean-like diet and the third component was defined by beverages, milk and dairy products, fruits, other dairy products, bakery and pastry, meat and meat products, and cereal-based baby foods with high positive loadings (Figure 1 and Table S1).

Parental education and HI variables did not show any statistical differences in both samples across ages (Table 3). According to the overall comparison between SRS and adapted milk consumers (AMS), SRS had higher values in age and moderate–vigorous physical activity, whereas Physical activity level (PAL) and body mass index (BMI) z-score did not show statistical differences. Across different ages, children aged 3 to <6 years in adapted milk consumers (AMS) had lower body mass index (BMI) z-scores than SRS children of the same age.",5c612117-82cf-444f-acc6-06e938b27bbb

Dietary and Lifestyle Patterns Clusters of subjects within each study sample, classified based on their dietary and lifestyle characteristics, are shown in Figure 3 for SRS and in Figure 4 for adapted milk consumers (AMS). Overall, there were three main clusters of subjects and dietary/lifestyle variables identified by the clustering algorithm (the silhouette method suggested three to four clusters by rows and columns). This was the case in both study samples and for every age group.  In the youngest age group in the SRS cohort (Figure 3A), we found three clusters of subjects and dietary/lifestyle variables.",4d4a9e9c-2bb5-4a0c-a734-fdedb0aebe24
23,methods23," Regarding the dietary/lifestyle clusters (in rows), cluster 1 contained more energy-dense foods; cluster 2 grouped foods of vegetable origin (legumes, fruits, nuts, cereals, and vegetables), meat and meat products, as well as oils and fats (similar to the “diverse plant and animal foods” and Mediterranean-like Principal component analysis (PCA)s); and cluster 3 featured intake of milk and dairy products, eggs, fish, and cereal-based baby foods. In terms of the subject’s characteristics, the first cluster was defined by older children with higher intakes of all food groups, except cereal-based baby foods. These subjects seemed to have a higher body mass index (BMI) z-score and high moderate–vigorous physical activity. Conversely, subjects in the second cluster showed a higher intake of food groups of dietary cluster 2, as well as milk and dairy products and cereal-based baby foods.",fd5edaee-6f36-4546-b076-a214c021f1c0
24,methods24," These subjects were more likely to be younger (around one year old) and tended to have a higher household income than the average. In the third cluster, we observed somewhat mixed patterns with regard to dietary and lifestyle variables. Subjects of this cluster were more inclined to consume fewer amounts of the food groups in dietary cluster 2, whereas some subjects showed both high and low intakes of the food groups in dietary cluster 1 (the more palatable energy-dense food cluster). Within this cluster of subjects, those with lower intakes of all food groups (below their mean intake) seemed to have a lower body mass index (BMI) z-score, higher physical activity, and a higher household income (and parental educational level). The opposite was observed for subjects whose intake of energy-dense foods (mostly appetizers and bakery and pastry) tended to be high. There were no clear patterns for any other lifestyle variables.",0fb415c4-924f-4020-b459-e7a80f0c8c9e
25,methods25,"  Within adapted milk consumers (AMS) (Figure 4A), we observed similar dietary clusters, except that cereal-based baby foods and milk and dairy products were clustered with legumes, cereals, fruits, and vegetables. Other dairy products were still included in the more palatable energy-dense dietary cluster. Clusters of subjects were also similar, with one cluster group of older children showing a rather high consumption of all foods including cereal-based baby foods, a second cluster group of older-aged but less active (overall Physical activity level (PAL)) children whose consumption of energy-dense foods exceeded that of the healthier dietary cluster, and a third cluster mostly composed of toddlers and with a distinguishable subcluster of milk, dairy, and cereals consumers. This latter subcluster seemed to comprise children with a higher body mass index (BMI) z-score. Parental income and education also appeared to be correlated with these subclusters.",b2704c00-fa05-4f5c-a130-dd625b93436c
26,methods26,"  In the three to six years age group, we observed similar dietary clusters in both study samples (Figure 3B and Figure 4B). The main difference between the two was that legumes, nuts, and fish were included in the energy-dense food group in SRS, whereas these food groups clustered together with other plant-based foods in adapted milk consumers (AMS). Milk and dairy products and cereal-based baby foods tended to cluster within this healthier cluster too. Children of this age group showed either high, low, or mixed consumption patterns of all foods. In the mixed group, we observed two distinct groups of children eating either higher amounts of healthy foods (i.e., plant-based) or less healthy foods (i.e., more palatable energy-dense foods). These subgroups were shaped by the children’s age and parental income and education. For instance, those with higher mean intake of plant-based foods and low consumption of energy-dense foods were younger and tended to have higher family incomes.",8896248a-8dfd-44e4-9e79-23b798ed4d64
27,methods27,"  The children aged six to nine years were similar to the above-described clusters and in the two study samples (Figure 3C and Figure 4C), with milk, dairy products, and cereals being clustered with the palatable energy-dense foods in SMS or fruits and vegetables in adapted milk consumers (AMS). The clusters of children (the high-, low-, and mixed-level consumers) also held in these study samples. The mixed group of both study samples mostly included children of lower parental income and education, showing a somewhat higher consumption of the more energy-dense foods.  Differences between the clusters with regard to dietary and lifestyle variables, to complement the description of the above clusters, are shown in Table 4. The results showed significant differences by age in all clusters and both study cohorts, except for SRS aged three to six years (data not shown).",db19b5d5-eacb-4db5-ab45-9eed206a0957
28,methods28," Although potential subclusters were not considered as a sample descriptive, we observed several important differences between the clusters. We found significant differences between the cluster of subjects by levels of physical activity. In general, lower activity levels in moderate–vigorous activity (EE-MVPA) and overall physical activity (PA) variables were related to unhealthier dietary choices, e.g., the second cluster in SRS aged 6 to <10 years, comprising subjects with higher consumption of palatable energy-dense foods, showed lower levels of vigorous activity compared to the other clusters. The same was observed in adapted milk consumers (AMS) for the third cluster and Physical activity level (PAL). body mass index (BMI) z-scores were significantly lower in some clusters compared to the others, e.g., in the third cluster in children aged less than three years in SRS and in children aged over six years in adapted milk consumers (AMS).",9ead0ea0-66b4-4560-9d4d-bc20db875037
29,methods29," Parental education (and HI) also differed significantly across the clusters in some age groups. For example, younger-aged children in adapted milk consumers (AMS) whose parents were of lower educational level were more frequently in the third cluster which mainly featured a lower consumption of milk and dairy products and cereal-based baby foods. Similarly, children aged 6 to <10 years in SRS with low parenteral education levels were more common in the second cluster, which indicated a higher consumption of sweetened beverages, pastries, and other energy-dense foods.  4. Discussion The main goals of this study were to determine the DPs in a representative SRS in three different age groups of Spanish children (one to nine years old) and in a convenience cohort of adapted milk consumers (AMS) of the same age groups, and to examine how several sociodemographic and lifestyle factors are clustered within the DPs and among the three age groups.",0d27a8c4-4625-413b-8c7e-b7268512f216
30,methods30," For SRS, we observed three components in the different age groups. The first component was “palatable energy-dense foods” in all group ages; here, the consumption of sweetened dairy products, sugars and sweets, bakery and pastry, ready to cook, appetizers, beverages, sauces and condiments, and oils and fats products predominated. The second and third components were a mix of Mediterranean-like diet and diverse plant and animal foods. Regarding adapted milk consumers (AMS) children, component one was a Mediterranean-like diet in children aged 1 to <3 years old, and 3 to <6 years old, whereas children aged 6 to <10 years were similar to SRS with palatable energy-dense foods. Similar to SRS, components two and three were a mix of palatable energy-dense foods and the Mediterranean-like diet, respectively.  Regarding the dietary and lifestyle clusters, we observed dietary clusters that were, to some extent, similar to the DPs observed in the Principal component analysis (PCA).",2c7a6e41-2914-4b57-a620-dfc68bc41209
31,methods31," In brief, in the youngest SRS children (aged 1 to <3 years), we observed a clustering of the more energy-dense foods (cluster 1) that resembled the palatable processed food cluster derived with Principal component analysis (PCA), a more Mediterranean-like group of foods (cluster 2), and a dairy milk products cluster including cereal-based baby foods (cluster 3), both of which tended to represent the Mediterranean-diet-like Principal component analysis (PCA)s. The children´s age and their lifestyle characteristics were found to be correlated with these dietary clusters. While the Mediterranean diet clusters were always present, some variations were observed in the older age groups, likely due to dietary adaptations to children´s growth. As such, there were not only slightly different dietary clusters defined in these other age groups, but also groups of children who were high- or low-level consumers of all foods.",51fc374a-3ae6-453f-a933-63caa464d4fb
32,methods32," Within adapted milk consumers (AMS), we observed somewhat similar dietary clusters to those seen in SRS, although some foods clustered differently, and the Mediterranean diet-like dietary pattern tended to be ranked first. It is important to mention that age was one of the main variables in our study and the differences were analyzed within the groups of the same ages to avoid comparisons determined with the stage of life (e.g., children with 1 to <3 years and 6 to <10 years). We also took special consideration of the fact that food groups, such as cereal-based baby foods, were more likely consumed by children aged less than 3 years.  The importance of adequate nutrition in early childhood development has been recognized for many decades. Epidemiological analyses and animal studies showed that nutritional effects early in life can encourage the responsiveness of the body to have a better nutritional status in the adult life [46].",d7c3a073-f944-4408-9694-134e6ddf39a1
33,methods33," Infants develop rapidly from 6 to 24 months and have high nutrient needs in comparison to their body size, so they might be disposed to dietary disproportions and insufficiencies [47]. However, the dietary intake, nutritional status, and lifestyle patterns of infants and toddlers are less well-characterized compared to children aged 9 to 12 years, adolescents, and adults [1,37,48,49,50].  Knowing dietary habits and their determinants is essential for evaluating the adequacy of nutrient intake as well as its impact on health in children. Overweight and obesity among children are a major health issue, and the diets of many children exceed dietary guidelines for fat, cholesterol, added sugar, saturated fatty acids, and sodium, and are low in fiber [51]. Changes from undernutrition to overnutrition are occurring in most nations in the world, with the trend of children consuming higher intakes of nutrients such as sugar, salt, and saturated fat [52].",3ceb9dbd-cc12-4d06-bf1a-3e6b9dc3bded
34,methods34," Therefore, several studies attempted to characterize dietary patterns and associated factors. Dietary intake patterns in 3427 children aged six years from Brazil were strongly influenced by socioeconomic characteristics. Younger maternal age at birth and both early weaning and early introduction of complementary feeding appeared to be related to unhealthier patterns with snacks and treats, including consumption of candies, sweetened beverages, chips/crisps, bread, butter, mayonnaise, margarine, coffee, and sugar [33]. Another study applied Principal component analysis (PCA) to derive DPs in two Australian studies of 14-month-old (n = 552) and 24-month-old (n = 493) children. Two patterns were identified in these two studies: one was characterized by fruits, grains, vegetables, cheese, and nuts, and the second by white bread, spreads, sweetened beverages, snacks, chocolate, and processed meat.",4705a47c-e956-465a-9b3c-5d768fc6f8c9
35,methods35," Lower maternal age and early breastfeeding termination were connected with the second component, and patterns were not related to body mass index (BMI) z-score [53]. A systematic review showed that in the majority of Mediterranean countries, children aged one to five years consumed fruit and vegetables quite frequently, but also notably consumed sugared beverages and snacks [54]. A recent study in 525 children aged two to five years from Lebanon reported two DPs, with the first described as “fast food and sweets” with higher consumption of sweetened beverages, fast foods, salty snacks and sweets, and a second pattern denominated as “traditional Lebanese”, with higher intakes of cereals, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables [55]. These previous studies highlighted the remarkably unhealthy DPs in children, similar to our results.",b6159bbc-c426-4411-8071-e50d4dd1f98c
36,methods36," In SRS, we identified palatable energy-dense foods as the main component, with sweetened dairy products, sugars and sweets, bakery and pastry, ready to cook, appetizers, beverages, sauces and condiments, and oils and fats products prevailing in the three age groups.  The term “Mediterranean diet” has been extensively used to explain the traditional dietary habits of people living around the Mediterranean Sea. This diet is defined by the predominant consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, legumes, nuts and seeds, and fish, with olive oil as the main source of added fat. Other important features of the Mediterranean diet are a relatively low intake of dairy products, mainly as fermented milk, i.e., yogurt and cheese, and low to moderate intake of fish and poultry meat, low consumption of red meat, and modest wine drinking in adults [56,57].",1bb26ad5-2f78-4a4d-ad68-ad12e1ce943e
37,methods37," Evidence from epidemiological studies supports the cardiometabolic benefits of the Mediterranean diet in terms of its favorable effects on obesity, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia [58]. The Mediterranean diet has been recognized as one of the most important DPs related to human health [58]. A recent umbrella review including 29 meta-analyses with 12,800,000 individuals showed that adherence to this dietary pattern is correlated with a significant risk reduction in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular and coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence [59,60].",237acbf2-a69f-45f2-aacd-897b3421ff4f
38,methods38," In particular, the Mediterranean diet is the dietary pattern most recommended to reduce cardiovascular risk in different populations by some scientific societies, such as the European Society of Cardiology, the European Atherosclerosis Society, the Canadian cardiovascular society, and the American Heart Association Nutrition Committee, among others [60]. Specifically, in children, adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower likelihood of presenting excess body weight and obesity [61,62]. In our study, the most consistent dietary pattern in children in SRS was related to a high consumption of energy-dense foods. However, secondary patterns resembled those of a Mediterranean-like diet. In contrast, adapted milk consumers (AMS) children exhibited a dietary pattern related to the Mediterranean diet as the main component in the majority of the studied population, with higher consumption of cereals, fruits, and vegetables, and milk and dairy products.",f50c7ae4-5198-4c7a-8865-c136c764309a
39,methods39,"  A total of 9301 European children aged two to nine years participated at baseline and two-year follow-up examinations of the “Identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants” (in children and infants” (IDEFICS)) study. For the Spanish population, three DPs were recognized at baseline and follow-up by applying clustering methods. These DPs were based on a higher frequency of consumption of snacks and fast food (processed), sweet foods and drinks (sweet), and fruits and vegetables (healthy) [35]. In Spain, the ANIBES study also demonstrated the appearance of three DPs in 207 children from 9 to 12 years, and 208 adolescents from 13 to 17 years with a low physical activity and poorer diet lifestyle pattern, and a high physical activity, low sedentary behavior, longer sleep duration, healthier diet lifestyle pattern [37]. In our study, those three components were palatable energy-dense foods and a Mediterranean-like diet.",f14ffd0f-8ccf-4a93-9647-8c94edf3fe58
40,methods40," Changes in Physical activity level (PAL) and body mass index (BMI) z-score were observed, but only in the adapted milk consumers (AMS) cohort. To the best of our knowledge, those are the only studies reporting DPs based on Spanish data.  Several studies showed that the ingestion of dairy foods has a neutral or inverse association with adverse cardiometabolic health outcomes [12,13]. Cereal consumption might be linked to a beneficial long-term health effect by providing non-digestible carbohydrates, which are mainly responsible for the development of an adult-like microbiota by increasing the Bacteroides population [63]. A study reported a negative association between cereal intake and hepatic fat in 110 overweight/obese children, stating that cereal ingestion might decrease hepatic fat in this pediatric population [64].",9dab0ad6-d283-4987-960d-c75c39643ff8
41,methods41," This healthier dietary pattern appeared mainly in the adapted milk consumers (AMS) cohort and could be related to the consumption of milk or adapted milk with cereals in the early stages of life. Interestingly, this dietary pattern was also related to the consumption of healthier foods, including cereals, vegetables and fruits.  The results of our cluster analysis combining lifestyle and dietary factors were consistent with those reported by other studies. These studies reported a healthy energy-balance-related behavior pattern characterized by a healthier diet with high levels of physical activity and low levels of sedentary behavior between children in different countries. Other studies conducted in different countries also reported the clustering of a combination of sedentary lifestyle with healthy diet [28,29,30,31,32,65].",032f6d0a-aa61-484d-ab65-0432dc0c685c
42,methods42," In Spanish studies conducted within the ANIBES study (455 children and adolescents aged older than nine years), DPs, physical activity, and sleeping patterns were shown to be clustered in two different groups: a low physical activity and poorer diet lifestyle pattern, which included a higher proportion of girls, and a healthier diet lifestyle pattern that was defined by high physical activity with low sedentary behavior and longer sleep duration [37]. We considered a younger population, so this study is therefore the first report of dietary/lifestyle clusters in Spanish toddlers and teenagers. Although our study population had a number of specific features, we found that poorer lifestyle and unhealthy dietary patterns were grouped together (for example, the more energy-dense foods cluster with lower physical activity levels).",077e438a-ca04-44d2-9f13-33e8194ea509
43,methods43," In contrast, the healthier dietary patterns were more likely present among children with healthier lifestyle patterns (for example, the more Mediterranean-like cluster with higher physical activity levels). Within age groups, we observed that age had a strong impact on the clustering, with dietary clusters and levels of food consumption being age-determinant. Importantly, lower household income and parental education seemed to be correlated with unhealthy dietary clusters. Children from low socioeconomic status seemed to be more likely to present sedentary behaviors and low physical activity levels, though not all studies agree in this regard [66]. As mentioned above, in our study, we observed that the unhealthier dietary clusters were more frequently maintained by children with lower physical activity levels. There were apparent differences between SRS and adapted milk consumers (AMS); the latter was a convenience sample of mostly formula-fed children.",ee920e4a-5c99-42f9-8aed-997781af8ee5
44,methods44," However, these differences were, for the most part, not significant. We observed concordant clusters between both study samples, which partly validates our findings.  The major strength of this study was the opportunity to investigate a large sample of Spanish children representative of Spanish children aged 1 to <10 years living in urban areas, and the possibility of comparing the results in a convenience sample of children (adapted milk consumers (AMS)) of the same age group. Two different methodological approaches were applied to identify the DPs and to validate our findings: Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analyses (bivariate and hierarchical clustering). We relied upon dietary information collected via the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and 24 h dietary recalls, but we considered the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) dietary data in the present study because a higher variance was explained and uses almost the total EsNuPI sample (1512/1514).",116f20c2-9b8e-4752-ae3c-d7444acd35d5
45,methods45,"  The limitations of the present study were the cross-sectional design, which provides evidence for the relationship between lifestyle and dietary factors but does not allow for causal inference. Residual confounding by unobserved and unmeasured factors is probable, and information on dietary intake, physical activity, weight, and other variables is prone to measurement error since the data were self-reported by the participants. However, a careful multistep quality control procedure was implemented to derive dietary intake to minimize this bias. For instance, the interviewers were coached by knowledgeable dieticians/nutritionists, and these professionals were responsible for inspection of the food consumption records during the study process and from the coding process to verify the survey data.  Subjective decisions have been constantly reported as a limitation in studies deriving a posteriori DPs with Principal component analysis (PCA) or cluster analysis [23].",b3d4f962-29a3-49d6-8f2a-f5c7a428207d
46,methods46," However, based on the available evidence, most identified DPs showed good reproducibility, fair relative validity, and good construct validity across different statistical solutions [24].  It is unlikely that energy intake influenced our results according to earlier studies comparing DPs derived with and without energy adjustment [67]. Another limitation is related to non-rural information due to the study design; we only analyzed areas with more than 50,000 inhabitants. The size of the study population for reliably assessing DPs was probably limited in some ages groups. Finally, the use of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in this kind of population has some limitations and requires parental supervision. Children were with the parents when the study questionnaires were answered; whenever it was possible, we preferred that children answered the questions themselves and their parents only assisted with some answers to avoid loss of information.  5.",5f82bf59-ce10-4a14-a42e-17725fd215ff
47,methods47," Conclusions The current study is the first exploring dietary clusters in Spanish children aged under nine years to the highest extent possible. The three identified dietary clusters demonstrated the existence of an unhealthy dietary pattern, with palatable and processed foods (also defined as palatable energy-dense foods) being consumed in all age groups and in the two study samples. Two Mediterranean-like DPs (the more healthier DPs) were also identified. Children from adapted milk consumers (AMS) showed a dietary pattern related to the Mediterranean diet as the main component, with high consumption of cereals, fruits, and vegetables, as well as milk and dairy products. Certain lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, i.e., Physical activity level (PAL), parental education, and HI, were found to be significantly correlated with the dietary clusters, suggesting that physical activity and socioeconomic status may be to some extent determinants of these DPs.",06ee7c4c-c439-42da-addb-a7c231d04636
48,methods48," Thus, the findings provide guidance for designing lifestyle interventions based on age group or based on parent education that could reverse the appearance of unhealthy DPs in the child population. Our findings represent a wake-up call for regulatory bodies and professional organizations to try to reduce the consumption of energy-dense foods. Further research is warranted to evaluate how these variables or others influence the health status of children and to assess the whole picture of the relationships between consumption of nutrients and lifestyle factors in properly designed longitudinal studies including the whole population (urban and rural). Intervention studies considering dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet and promotion of physical activity might be necessary to establish the role of dietary and lifestyle factors on health determinants of the Spanish pediatric population.
