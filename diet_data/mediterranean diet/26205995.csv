0,introduction0,"The 2010 World Health Report describes how a few major risk factors account for much of the morbidity and mortality across the globe. Sedentary lifestyle, or low physical activity (PA), is among the leading causes of the major noncommunicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and diverse types of cancer, contributing substantially to the global onus of diseases, death and disability. Thus, sedentary lifestyle is also recognized as one of the most modifiable risk factors for those pathologies [1–2].  Previous studies have reported the prevalence of sedentary lifestyle in several countries and have discussed its health impact on society [3–4]. In 2002, European countries presented a general sedentariness rate of 31%, with the lowest rates found in the Netherlands and Denmark, 19.3 and 22.3% respectively, and the highest rates in France and Belgium, 43.1 and 39.8% respectively [3].

1,introduction1,"23 million of persons [5], presented a prevalence of sedentary lifestyle of 31.2% in adult population, according to that data from 2002 [3].  In light of the changes in social behavior during the last few decades, which reflect the worrying increasing prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and type 2 diabetes, new reports containing updated data are essential. The aim of this study was to analyze a current and detailed characterization of PA in Spain though a nationwide, population-based study to offer and to describe its relationship with age, sex, diabetes status, and other cardiovascular risk factors.

Population The Di@bet.es Study was a national, cross-sectional, population-based survey conducted in Spain during 2009–2010 to examine the prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose regulation, and of other cardiovascular risk factors, including physical inactivity [6]. A cluster (n = 100 Primary Care Centers) sampling design was used to select adult participants, forming a representative random sample of the Spanish population. From the initial 5,072 individuals, 4991 completed the Short Form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (SF-International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) [7]. Eighty-one questionnaires were incomplete and were considered invalid for the study.",e08affaf-20b5-4136-a1d6-2c1f9982ed30
3,methods1,"  Participants were invited to attend a one-time appointment at their primary health care center. Information was collected using a structured, interview-administered questionnaire followed by a physical examination. (Full questionnaire in original language [S1 File, Diabetes Study Questionnaire in original Spanish-language] and its translation to English [S2 File, Diabetes Study Questionnaire, English translation] are available as Supporting Information). Age, sex, education level, smoking habits, level of adherence to a Mediterranean diet, and personal history of hypertension and dyslipidemia were recorded [8–10]. Weight, height and waist and hip circumferences were directly measured; blood pressure was recorded; and body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated [6]. Central obesity was defined as waist to hip ratio greater than 0.85 for women and 1 for men.",771882ac-9411-4476-94a3-75cc713abd46
4,methods2," After the interview, a fasting blood sample was obtained and a standard oral glucose tolerance test was performed in individuals without known diabetes (known diabetes (KDM)) to identify those subjects with unknown diabetes (Uknown diabetes (KDM)) and PREDM (prediabetes: impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose) [11]. Participants who refused the OGTT (n = 1,429) were classified according to their fasting glucose levels. Atherogenic dyslipidemia was defined as triglycerides > 150mg/dl and HDLc < 40 mg/dl for men or HDLc < 45 mg/dl for women. Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) was calculated [12].  Physical activity (PA) was estimated using the Short Form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (SF-International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)), in which individuals report the number of days and the duration of the vigorous, moderate, and walking activities during the previous week [4].",2f48684c-6467-48d2-94bb-5e9cbd31111a
5,methods3," These data were quantified, and an estimated MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) was attributed to each activity [4]. According to International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) score, each individual was assigned to one of three categories: high, moderate, and low PA [7]. Those individuals who did not reach a minimum of minutes and/or days per week of vigorous, moderate or walking activities met the criteria for low PA levels and were thus considered sedentary individuals [3,4,7]. Conversely, those individuals meeting criteria for high or moderate PA categories were identified as active individuals. ",5e52b3c4-4652-4bc6-ae37-fc522b004f81

To estimate prevalence of sedentariness in Spain, standardized rates (x100 pop.) of low PA category (from International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) were calculated using the direct method. The age and sex structure of the Spanish population (National Institute of Statistic [INE] 2010) was used as the standard population [5]. Anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory differences across three glucose metabolism categories (known diabetes (KDM), PREDM/Uknown diabetes (KDM) and normal glucose regulation [NORMAL]) or between sedentary vs. active individuals were evaluated by the chi-squared test (for categorical), Wilcoxon or Kruskal-Wallis test (for continuous non-normally distributed), or student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA (for continuous normally distributed), respectively.",8fa9a41b-7227-47ff-a4c7-e313bd2bec3c
7,analysis1," Multiple logistic regression models or adjusted general linear models (PROC GLM in SAS) were used to investigate factors associated with physical activity (dependent) variables after adjustment for confounders (age, sex, body mass index (BMI), glucose metabolism categories etc). These tests were also used to evaluate age*sex interactions (with or without additional body mass index (BMI) adjustment) in the association between age, sex, and PA. Finally, logistic multiple stepwise (level of entry p < 0.15) regression analysis was used to investigate variables independently associated with sedentary lifestyle. In the Di@bet.es Study [6] the sample size was calculated to investigate the prevalence of diabetes in Spain. The significance level was defined as p ≤ 0.05.

16,discussion0,"This nationwide population-based study provides current information on the prevalence of low PA (sedentariness) and other International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) derived variables in Spain. Age-and-sex standardized rate of sedentary lifestyle (low PA) was 35.7% (32.3% for men and 39% for women). These ciphers are higher than previous data from 2002 (Fig 1), when 31.2% of the Spanish population (27.3% for men and 34.9% for women) were sedentary, using the same methodology (SF-International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) questionnaire). Therefore, we observed that sedentariness, one of the most important risk factors for several chronic diseases, as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, is increasing in Spain. Indeed, our data agree with the pessimist projections of a worsened rate of these conditions in the decades to come [14–16]. The criterion of sedentary lifestyle employed by Sjöström and col.

17,discussion1,"[4] was the main variable applied in the present study. Other variables, such as ≥ 1000MET-min/week of PA [13] or no PA at all, were also reported here to facilitate the comparison to other studies and guidelines. Regardless of the different indexes presented, all of them show the same tendency of a lack of compliance with the health guidelines of recommended PA.  We observed that the association between age and PA was not linear and was associated with sex and body mass index (BMI) (Fig 2). Younger (< 30 years) and older women (> 60 years) were more sedentary that men in the same age group. Previous studies have also shown lower rates of PA in younger women as compared to men, and these rates become similar with an increase in age [17,18]. However, our multiple regression analysis (Table 4) showed an inverse association between aging and sedentary lifestyle after accounting for many confounders, adding further proof to the complex nature of this relationship.",10e39286-f9e7-412c-a5ad-454105eac610
18,discussion2,"  Other studies also reported association of sedentariness with cardiovascular risk factors. Arteaga and col.[18] demonstrated an inverse association of PA with insulin resistance in young adults. Leisure time PA was inversely associated with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and HOMA-IR in a study of the Swedish population [19]. Previous European data [20] also showed an association of sedentary lifestyle and obesity with lower educations levels. In our study, sedentariness was associated with most cardiovascular risk factors (Table 4) including anthropometric, laboratory, clinical, and lifestyle factors (i.e. adherence to a cardiovascular-healthy diet) [21].  We also explored PA across glucose metabolism categories (normal glucose regulation, PREDM/Uknown diabetes (KDM), and known diabetes (KDM)) and found lower PA from normal to PREDM/known diabetes (KDM) to known diabetes (KDM) glucose metabolism categories (Table 3).",895ebfd2-736d-4893-95d0-b9c15a627de8
19,discussion3," Furthermore, to avoid the confounding effect of clinical intervention for diabetes treatment, PA in individuals with known diabetes (KDM) was also compared with the closer group (based on age, sex distribution, and body mass index (BMI)), i.e., PREDM/Uknown diabetes (KDM) individuals. No major differences (according to healthy recommendations) between these two groups (Table 3 and Results section) were found. A recent study developed in Spain [22] also analyzed known and unknown diabetes and identified that patients that already knew of their diabetes had more medical advice to practice PA, but in fact, they did the same amount of PA as those with unknown diabetes. Other studies also indicate that adults with diabetes have lower levels of PA than those without diabetes [23,24]. This indicates that those patients with known diabetes perform no more beneficial (sufficient or therapeutic) PA than those at-risk individuals who are not aware of their condition.",c0df30d9-09aa-46dd-8864-c1b8498d69f2
20,discussion4," This finding points to a possible failure in the current strategies for promoting PA, even in individuals with diabetes, who should have received formal indications to increase PA as part of their treatment, and would prompt diabetes health providers to improve PA prescription and/or adherence. On the other hand, Murillo and col. [25] reported that Spanish patients with type 2 diabetes were more likely to perform PA, mainly walking, as compared to European data. Other recent encouraging results were reported in a longitudinal study conducted in the USA of 68,132 women with recently diagnosed diabetes, showing an increase in PA and a reduction in sedentary behavior following the diagnosis of diabetes [26]. Studies such as DPP [27], Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS) [28] and Look AHEAD [29] are clear in demonstrating the importance and effectiveness of a PA program for preventing diabetes in persons at risk for (with prediabetes) or with established type 2 diabetes.",08048355-b112-42bf-b277-f1848c6dc5cc
21,discussion5,"  The main strength of the study is that the Di@bet.es Study was designed to be representative of the whole national territory, enabling the evaluation of several clinical, biochemical and demographic characteristics of the Spanish population during the period 2009–2010. In addition, the SF-International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) is an easy and reproducible tool that has already been validated by different countries and cultures, facilitating the comparison and contrast to other populations. However, this questionnaire also has some limitations. The SF-International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) is not as precise as tools like accelerometers [30], particularly in the evaluation of the category of high PA. Furthermore, over-reporting of PA by those interviewed must be considered (discussed in Strath and col. [31] and Felix-Redondo and col. [32]) and, in fact, the prevalence of sedentariness could actually be even higher.",79fc99dd-acc6-47a5-b8e6-d79076ec3c7b
22,discussion6," Finally, our general study questionnaire did not contemplate specific health conditions that could hamper the practice of PA and are found more frequently in persons with type 2 diabetes and/or obesity, which could explain, in part, the levels of sedentary lifestyle in these groups [33]. Nevertheless, this is a limitation that commonly affects large epidemiological surveys.  Supporting Information S1 File Diabetes Study Questionnaire in original Spanish-language.
