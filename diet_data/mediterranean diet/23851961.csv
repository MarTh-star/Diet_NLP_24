0,background0,"Olive oil is a key component of the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet), being the main source of vegetable fat, especially monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) [1]. Virgin olive oil, produced by mechanically pressing ripe olives, contains multiple bioactive and antioxidant components such as polyphenols, phytosterols and vitamin E [1], and has an acidity of <1.5%. Extra-virgin olive oil (Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) is also produced by mechanically pressing the olives but is the oil with the best quality, the most intense taste and its acidity is <1%. In contrast, common olive oil, obtained from a mixture of virgin and refined oil (usually more than 80% is refined), has fewer antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. Since refined olive oil during the refining process loses phytochemicals, this oil is mixed with virgin olive oil to enhance the flavor, constituting the so-called common olive oil [2].",de5943ef-a14e-45a2-8841-15f91862b5ae
1,background1,"  Evidence suggests that olive oil intake is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) in the Spanish general population [3] and in a cohort of Italian women [4]. In the Spanish cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)) study, total olive oil intake has been associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease, and also all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [5,6]. Similarly, a lower risk of mortality was associated with regular consumption of olive oil in an Italian population after myocardial infarction [7] and also in an elderly population [8]. A recent meta-analysis concluded that epidemiologic studies consistently found an inverse association between olive oil consumption and stroke, but there were inconsistencies between studies assessing coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) as the end-point [9].",1dd0553d-0499-4d5c-ae1a-125fedd91899
2,background2," Of note, most of the previous studies made no distinction among the different varieties of olive oil [4,7,8]. Except for the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spanish cohort that found a greater beneficial effect in coronary heart disease (CHD) for the virgin olive oil variety than for the common variety [5] and similar effects for both varieties on all-cause mortality [6]. This distinction is important because Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) contains much higher amounts of polyphenols than common olive oil. These polyphenols may have cardiovascular benefits beyond the lipid profile. It has also been reported that olive oil intake could be beneficial in the prevention of certain cancers, such as breast cancer [10], but the evidence is weaker.",7722e792-7579-464a-af10-09a320ad4ff6
3,background3,"  Recently, in the context of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED)) Study, it has been demonstrated that a MedDiet enriched with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) improved lipid profile, decreased blood pressure and reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events [11,12]. In this observational analysis of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) population, we aimed to assess the associations between baseline olive oil consumption and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cause-specific and overall mortality. We hypothesized that higher consumption of olive oil, especially the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) variety, would be associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cause-specific and overall mortality in an elderly Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk, independent of the allocated arm of the trial.

Briefly, the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) study is a large, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized and controlled clinical trial for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (http://www.predimed.es). The main results of the trial on the primary endpoint have been published elsewhere [12]. We assigned 7,447 participants (men aged 55 to 80 years and women 60 to 80 years) to one of three interventions: a MedDiet supplemented with Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), a MedDiet supplemented with mixed nuts, or advice on a low-fat diet (control diet).",4e7f9740-3ab8-4996-b84c-ab93dcc3334f

The outcomes were: (a) composite of cardiovascular events, (b) cardiovascular mortality, (c) cancer mortality and (d) all-cause mortality. All participants provided written informed consent according to a protocol approved by the institutional review boards of all the recruiting centers (Comité de Ética e Investigación Clínica [CEIC] Hospital Universitari Sant Joan de Reus, CEIC Universidad de Navarra, CEIC Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Comité de Ética Universidad de Valencia, CEIC-Parc de Salut Mar, CEIC Hospital Universitario Araba, CEIS del distrito Sanitario Atención Primaria Sevilla, IDIAP Jordi Gol, CEIC Complejo Hospitalario Materno-Insular, CEIC Facultad Medicina Universidad de Málaga, CEIC Illes Balears,",66691562-4bf2-4c37-894c-ef2d19211c49

Assessment of olive oil consumption and other covariates At baseline and yearly during the follow-up, trained dieticians completed a 137-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) in a face-to-face interview with the participants. This questionnaire has been validated before in a population at high cardiovascular risk from Spain. Reproducibility and validity of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for total olive oil consumption, estimates by the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) were 0.55 and 0.60, respectively, and the intraclass correlation coefficients for reproducibility and validity were 0.71 (P <0.001) [14]. Energy and nutrient intake were estimated using updated Spanish food composition tables [15,16]. Information on consumption of different types of olive oil intake was derived from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).",9689b0d8-56cf-41c9-9f51-6aef94b32a08
8,methods4," The questionnaire includes three different questions regarding the consumption of olive oil: Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake (produced by mechanically pressing the olives, acidity <1%), refined olive oil intake (refined olive oil, acidity <0.3%) and pomace olive oil (obtained from the residue of pressing the olives and mixed with other refined olive oils, acidity <0.3%). The dieticians asked the participants if they consumed one tablespoon of olive oil (for each of the specific varieties): never, between one to three times per month, times per week (once, two to four, five to six, three options) or times a day (once, two to three, four to six, more than six, four options). These questions were transformed to continuous variables in grams per day. The first question was used to assess Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake, the sum of the second and third questions (refined olive oil and pomace olive oil) was considered common olive oil intake.",4fb1a1da-d633-4c0b-84dd-2be3b36a9074
9,methods5," The sum of all the three questions provides the total amount of olive oil consumed.  In addition, dieticians administered a validated 14-item MedDiet screener designed to assess the degree of adherence to the traditional MedDiet [17]. Two questions in the screener are related to olive oil intake (use of olive oil as the main fat for cooking (1 point if the answer is yes) and using four or more tablespoons of olive oil (1 point if the answer is yes), with 14 points the total score of the questionnaire). To control for the overall dietary pattern, we used this MedDiet screener removing the variables related to olive oil consumption; thus, a 12-point score was used as a covariate in the models.  At baseline, a questionnaire about lifestyle variables, educational achievement, history of illnesses and medication use was administered. Physical activity was assessed using the validated Spanish version of the Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity questionnaire [18].",90671c43-a5b9-4697-9b41-f35aa5d65dfa

Similarly, the hazard ratio of coronary heart disease (CHD) in participants in the top quartile of olive oil consumption in the Spanish European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.59 to 1.03) compared to the reference, after a 10.4-year follow-up. In this study, the reduction of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk was greater for virgin olive oil than for the common variety [5].",59954d71-cfca-446f-87c5-4a87593476c5
32,discussion4,"  We found a strong relationship between total olive oil consumption and the composite of cardiovascular major events, but when we analyzed separately myocardial infarction and stroke, the associations were non-significant. This could be explained by the lack of statistical power, but, according to our results, two previous case-control studies conducted in an Italian population also reported no associations between olive oil intake and myocardial infarction [20,21].  Our data suggest that total olive oil intake was inversely associated with cardiovascular mortality but not with cancer mortality: each 10 g/d increase in total olive oil consumption is associated with a 16% reduction in cardiovascular mortality.",26e2d34f-bd0d-4736-ad81-45993c3d963f
33,discussion5," These results are supported by the findings of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain, where a 44% reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality was found in participants at the top quartile of total olive oil consumption compared to those in the bottom quartile [6] and they can contribute to solving the inconsistencies reported by a recent meta-analysis [9]. In the same study of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain, total olive oil intake was not associated with cancer mortality [6]. However, like our study, this study did not examine specific types of cancer. A recent review of epidemiological studies reported some evidence suggesting that olive oil can decrease the risk of upper digestive and respiratory tract neoplasms, breast cancer and probably cancer in other sites [10]. Therefore, future larger studies or meta-analyses may need to focus on incidence and mortality of specific cancer sites.",6e7ee9f9-be51-4a0a-b6ad-bf31012bfc11
34,discussion6,"  The outcomes regarding olive oil consumption and all-cause mortality have been inconsistent, as reported in a recent meta-analysis including a large number of participants [9]. A previous study conducted in participants from Italy, who have suffered a myocardial infarction, showed that there was a 24% (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.91) reduction in the risk of overall mortality for those consuming olive oil regularly compared to those who never consumed olive oil [7]. The results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-cohort indicated a 26% (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.87) reduction in the risk of overall mortality for those in the highest quartile of total olive oil intake compared to the lowest quartile [6]. On the contrary, no associations were found between total olive oil intake and all-cause mortality in a free-living Greek population [22].",3be51366-34c5-4625-bdda-20aa23967271
35,discussion7," Our findings suggest a non-significant possible inverse relation between each 10 g/d (one tablespoon of oil) increase in total olive oil and Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption and all-cause mortality.  The inverse associations between olive oil consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD) could be explained by several mechanisms. The beneficial effects of olive oil are mainly attributed to its high content on monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)s (that are less susceptible to oxidation than other type of fatty acids) but also to other minor components with important biological properties, such as phenolic compounds, vitamin E and other lipid-derivate molecules (squalene, tocopherols, triterpenic alcohols and so on), especially occurring in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) [2,3]. Evidence suggests that olive oil has anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects and it may also play a beneficial role in reducing oxidative stress and improving endothelial function [3,23,24].",500cb3c1-7bc1-49ad-8ccf-6599915d948a
36,discussion8," Moreover, it has been observed that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), particularly in a context of a MedDiet, improved lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, decreased blood pressure [11,24-27] and also was inversely associated with new-onset diabetes [28], all of them considered strong risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).  The strengths of the present study are its prospective design and a relatively long duration of follow-up. In addition, previous studies made no distinctions among different varieties of olive oil, but we analyzed the associations for Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and common olive oil separately. The present study was conducted in a population where the intake of total olive oil was relatively high, allowing a better assessment of the association between olive oil consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or mortality.  Some limitations of our study deserve attention.",323fc27e-4897-4d82-ae28-0290fdf8b70e
37,discussion9," First, the generalizability of our results may be limited, as the studied population was composed of Mediterranean elderly individuals at high cardiovascular risk who increased their intake of olive oil due to the intervention. However, the findings from our study are broadly consistent with those from other populations. Although the individuals changed their oil consumption during the study and this could have affected the observed beneficial effects of olive oil, it should be noted that the baseline intake of olive oil was high and the baseline assessment can be considered as a good correlate of lifetime habits in this population. Second, because of the observational nature of the study, residual confounding remains a possibility even though our analyses were extensively adjusted for a wide range of cardiovascular risk factors.",b3dd635f-ec9d-45cc-b0a1-d15dfefce9b2
38,discussion10," Nonetheless, our observational findings are consistent with the intervention effects observed in the olive oil enriched arm in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) trial. Finally, although the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used was validated, measurement errors are inevitable, especially regarding self-reported different varieties of olive oil.  Conclusions In summary, we found that greater consumption of total olive oil, especially Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), was associated with reduced cardiovascular disease and mortality risk in an elderly Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk. Our findings underscore olive oil consumption as one of the key components of the MedDiet for cardiovascular disease prevention.",e8c39d5d-2757-43dc-b5bc-41ec8f090a21
