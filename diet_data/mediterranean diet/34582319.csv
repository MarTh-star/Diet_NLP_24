Participants  Participants (university students) were included by probability single-stage cluster sampling at the Faculties of Medicine and Pharmacy at the University of Seville (Andalusia, Spain, South of Europe). Four random classrooms were selected in each school.  In each of the selected classrooms, the students were informed of the objectives, risks, and benefits of the research, including collection of samples. Confidentiality of participant data was guaranteed at all times in accordance with the provisions of the Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data (15/1999 of 13 December, LOPD) and under the conditions established by Law 14/2007 of Spanish biomedical research.",8badf91b-aade-45f5-8a42-69c4e16dffb4

Exclusion criteria: Food intolerances, chronic pathologies, or pregnancy (due to the possibility of requiring specialized dietary recommendations).  A member of the research group showed the project to the participants and provided information on how to participate in the study (interested students must send an e-mail to the study address provided in the presentation) and how the e-12HR app works.",81653687-9e88-4496-8828-3896102ba40f

Randomization and Masking  Of the 4 selected classrooms in each school (Medicine and Pharmacy), 2 were randomly assigned to the CG and 2 to the IG.  Due to the nature of the intervention, the participants could not be blinded. However, the person responsible for the statistical analysis remained blinded throughout the study. In addition, although the different versions of the application were available in the Apple Store or Play Store at all times, as previously mentioned, personal alphanumeric codes were assigned so that each participant only had access to their version of the application depending on whether they belonged to the IG (‘feedback’ e-12HR, with the two new functionalities) or to the CG (‘non-feedback’ e-12HR, without the two new functionalities).",d8d655e1-5032-4ded-a1db-2684887ae294

CG: the participants used ‘non-feedback’ e-12HR for the same time period.  e-12HR App  Data Collection on Food Group Intake  The operation of e-12HR is similar for the two versions of the application used in the present study (‘feedback’ e-12HR and ‘non-feedback’ e-12HR).  e-12HR is an application that has been previously validated and that allows for collecting long-term data on dietary intake of food groups [20,21,22,23,24].  Once downloaded, participants were asked to activate the app on first use by typing in a personally assigned alphanumeric code. After this, participants would register the number of standard portions of each of the 19 food groups from the study that they consumed during the day.",7a19283d-2c91-491e-8a5a-f2e573d3b93a
5,methods5," These food groups were vegetables, breakfast cereals, fruits, pasta, rice, bread, olive oil, milk and dairy products, nuts, fermented beverages (beer and wine), potatoes, fish, white meat, legumes, eggs, red meat, processed meats, and sweets. The app lets users register in minutes how much moderate and intense physical activity they had performed throughout the day.  Participants were also instructed to use the app once they had finished their last meal of the day [26,27]. The app can be completed only between 8 PM and 4 AM, which might seem to be a strange time range, but the team chose it in order to give users enough time to complete the task. It was taken into account that university students, who are mainly young adults, tend to go out on evenings and can stay out eating and drinking until late at night. The time period selected allowed users to register those foods/drinks in the application, as well.",82f97312-9305-4286-856d-86546f8a5c4f
6,methods6,"  At the end of each monitoring day, an alert appeared on the participants’ phones, letting them know that it was time to complete the app. Participants were allowed to set the time for the alert according to their own preferences). From that point, participants could access the task and enter the number of standard servings they had consumed during that day for each of the food groups mentioned above and the amount of physical activity in minutes.  In order to assist with the estimation of the number of servings consumed, each food group was accompanied by a text that explained different homemade measures since the research team considered it more appropriate and easier to follow for participants without prior experience in dietetics. The standard servings used by e-12HR were based on a previously validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire for people in Spain [28].",d25b24ef-7a4e-4cb1-ba0e-d19f90ce2902
7,methods7," As an example, participants would see the following when using the app: “How many servings of fish (and/or shellfish) have you consumed today? 1 serving = 100–150 g. Homemade measures: 1 serving = One single regular steak. 0.5 servings = One can of tuna, etc.”. Participants introduced the corresponding number in the “Answer” section and then tapped the “Next” button to go on to the next food group. The app also lets participants use decimals to estimate the portions consumed. If there was an error when registering information, participants were able to return to the previous page by tapping the “Previous” button to begin the process again (Figure 2).  To improve the app’s usability, the different food groups were in the same order every day (Appendix A, Table A1) and each food group had a representative image.  After completing the daily questionnaire, the information collected was automatically saved in the participant’s mobile phone (to be used later by the application, see 2.",bb812370-8fb9-4416-8489-7e2507ab6dd2

This meant that the participants were not able to change their previous responses, and they were not able to access the app until the following day when they were prompted to complete the next questionnaire.  Dietary data registration through the e-12HR app was scheduled for 28 consecutive days. Study participants could see when they had completed the study period as there was a counter with the number of days the task had been successfully completed in the app.  2. Feedback from e-12HR  This section is only applicable to ‘feedback’ e-12HR app.  adherence to the MD (AMD) Assessment  Every seven days during the 28-day study period, as an automatic function, the application processed the daily data collected on the user’s food intake in order to establish an adherence to the MD (AMD) index, specifically, the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS)) index [29].",c320fa79-892f-4c1c-8689-577865eb41db
9,methods9," To do so, previously-established rules were taken into account, which considers [29]:The specific food groups (compatible with the MD);  Consumption recommendations for frequency of standard servings (per meal, daily or weekly);  A numerical score assigned to each item (Appendix A, Table A2).  However, in the case of recommendations on frequency of consumption, some modifications had to be made in order to adapt them to the characteristics of e-12HR [25] (Table 1).  Cereals: pasta, breakfast cereals, bread and rice. Olive oil: for salads, on bread or for frying. Milk and dairy products: yogurt, cheese and milk. Fermented beverages such as wine and beer. White meat: poultry. Red meat: beef, pork and lamb. Sweets: candies, sugar, pastries, sweetened fruit juices and soft drinks.  For food groups calculated on a weekly basis, the app used the rules shown in Table 1.",e6ecd9d6-8fdf-422d-b3f4-ef6edd04821e
10,methods10," However, for food groups calculated on a daily basis, the procedure was as follows: every seven days, for each specific food group, the number of standard portions registered daily throughout this period were added all together first, and the result was then divided by seven. For the food groups calculated on a daily basis with scores greater than 1, the scoring rules were as follows [19,25]:  1. Fruits contribute 1 point for 1—<2 servings, 2 points for 2—<3 servings, and 3 points for 3—6 servings per day.  2. Vegetables contribute 1 point for 2—<4 servings, 2 points for 4—<6 servings, and 3 points for ≥6 servings per day.  3. Cereals contribute 1 point for 1—<2 servings, 2 points for 2—<3 servings, and 3 points for 3—6 servings per day.  4. Olive oil contributes 1 point for 1—<2 serving, 2 points for 2—<3 servings, and 3 points for 3—4 servings per day.  5. Milk and dairy products contribute 1 point for 1—<2 servings and 2 points for 2—3 servings per day.  6.",d59d9e08-7f3a-45ec-be19-e3046077633f
11,methods11," Nuts contribute 2 points for 1—2 servings per day.  For each individual food group, if the indicated recommendations are not followed, the app assigns a value of zero for that group.  To complete the process, e-12HR added up all of the values and released a scoring of the adherence to the MD (AMD) index (Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) index), which could vary between zero and twenty-four.  On top of this, as an automatic function, the app related the score on the adherence to the MD (AMD) index with one of three levels of adherence to the MD (AMD) (low, moderate, high), displaying the image of a traffic light (Appendix A, Table A3) [19].",632c79be-dd67-4c51-ac19-4d392f8d76a3
12,methods12,"  adherence to the MD (AMD) Report  Finally, also as an automatic function, together with the adherence to the MD (AMD) assessment (index and level of adherence to the MD (AMD)), e-12HR provides a report on adherence to the MD (AMD) that includes two numbered lists: (1) Food groups in which the user has successfully fulfilled the MD recommendations (‘compliant’ food groups), and which the user needs to maintain their consumption (highlighted in green); (2) Food groups in which the user has not fulfilled the MD recommendations (‘non-compliant’ food groups), and which require a modification in consumption in order to improve adherence to the MD (AMD) (highlighted in red) [30] (Table 2).",780e83d5-1f84-4562-a1ca-eda31b59ed4e
13,methods13,"  Altogether, the process followed in the study was as follows: (1) Every day, the participants recorded their consumption data for a series of food groups through the e-12HR app and, automatically, the app saved data in the participant’s mobile telephone and sent that data to the study website; (2) Every seven days, automatically, the app processed the collected daily information and produced personalized feedback for the user: an adherence to the MD (AMD) assessment (index and level of adherence to the MD (AMD)) and an adherence to the MD (AMD) report (point 2 is only applicable to the IG) (Figure 3).  The feedback process was carried out at seven days (baseline, week 1) and repeated at fourteen (week 2), twenty-one (week 3), and twenty-eight (week 4) days of monitoring. The adherence to the MD (AMD) report included the two numbered lists of food groups highlighted in green or red so that the user could see, in a simple way, their evolution throughout the study period.",40b29423-fa2b-4d82-98d8-858e778ff598
14,methods14,"  The feedback provided by e-12HR (adherence to the MD (AMD) assessment and adherence to the MD (AMD) report), was available for consultation by participants from the moment it appeared through the “Reports” tab in the app. Furthermore, in the app’s “History” tab, participants could consult the data collected during each day they used e-12HR.  2.5. Follow-Up and Outcome Measures  In order to assess the effect of the intervention (‘feedback’ e-12HR), follow-up was carried out at seven (baseline), fourteen, twenty-one, and twenty-eight days of monitoring.  The main result variable was the change in total score of the adherence to the MD (AMD) index at fourteen, twenty-one, and twenty-eight days of monitoring; while the secondary result variables were the total score of the ADM index, the personal information variables, and the answers to usability rating questionnaire for e-12HR (see Section 2.7. Usability Rating Questionnaire for e-12HR section).",311186ce-1d16-4849-b3e0-c8cc4032b1e5
15,methods15,"  Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet  Every seven days during the 28-day study period (at seven (baseline), fourteen, twenty-one, and twenty-eight days of monitoring), the score of adherence to the MD (AMD) index (specifically Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) index [29]) was calculated manually (for CG and IG) by the research team using the daily data sent by the application to the study website.

The nQuery Advisor Release version 7.0 (Statistical Solutions, Cork, Ireland) was used to calculate the sample size.  2.7. Usability Rating Questionnaire for e-12HR  After the 28-day study period, the research team members sent separate e-mails to participants that contained a usability rating questionnaire [24,31,32,33] for the e-12HR app, with five questions about completing the daily e-12HR task (Appendix A, Table A4).  Each participant had to complete this usability rating questionnaire and return it to the same e-mail address.  2.8.

Results  3.1. Sample and Adherence to the Study  A total of three hundred and sixty students (from the eight classrooms randomly selected for the study) fulfilled the inclusion requirement (two students were excluded for being diabetic) and signed the informed consent forms. Of them, 74 (35 in CG and 39 in IG) were considered non-responsive since they had completed the task on the app for fewer than 28 days (Figure 1); the data for these participants were not included in the later statistical analysis. The study response rate was 79.4% (286/360): 78.5% (128/163) in CG, and 80.2% (158/197) in IG.  3.2. Personal Information of the Participants  Table 3 shows the personal information of the participants (CG and IG).",3dc21ac0-8bd2-48f7-9571-166110b865d1
19,methods19,"  There were no statistically significant differences in the variables studied between the CG and the IG, except in “school”, although in both groups (CG and IG), medical students are the majority (more than 50% of the sample).  There were no statistically significant differences in the study variables between participants who completed the study and those who did not. Those participants who completed the study registered their daily consumption for the included 19 food groups for 8008 days altogether (representing a collected total of 152,152 data points on daily consumption for the food groups).  3.3. Effect of the Intervention  For CG and IG, scoring for the adherence to the MD (AMD) index was calculated manually by the research team for each of the weeks during the study monitoring period (using the daily data sent by the app to the study website and the rules shown in Section e-12HR App, (2) Feedback From e-12HR subsection: adherence to the MD (AMD) Assessment.",0069e088-24a0-4aed-a7fb-6a009e8df10e
20,methods20,"  As for the calculations performed by the research team, the obvious errors resulting during data entry were modified (as the team considered that the data must have been introduced as grams or milliliters instead of standard servings). As an example, on one occasion, a value of 50 was introduced for the question, “How many servings of legumes (lentils, beans, chickpeas, peas, etc.) have you consumed today”? It was considered that this value must indicate consumption of 50 g, which is equivalent to one serving. In any case, the data were modified by the team on only 572 occasions out of 152,152 total registered data points (0.38%).  Table 4 and Table 5 show the adherence to the MD (AMD) indices for CG and IG.  Intragroup modifications: In the CG, the mean score of the adherence to the MD (AMD) index showed few variations throughout the 4 weeks of follow-up (ranging from 7.91, week 1, to 8.20, week 4) (Table 4).",63242792-e23e-472f-a1b2-0ee0471a19ca
21,methods21," There were no significant statistical differences either throughout the 4 weeks of study (Table 4) or in weeks two, three, and four compared to week one (Table 5). In the IG, the mean score of the adherence to the MD (AMD) index ranged from 8.08 (week 1) to 9.63 (week 4) throughout the 4 weeks of follow-up. These differences were statistically significant (Table 4), specifically when comparing weeks two, three, and four with week one (0.54, 1.43, and 1.55 points increase, respectively) (Table 5).  Intergroup modifications: There were significant statistical differences between the adherence to the MD (AMD) indices in the comparison of CG versus IG in weeks two, three, and four, in favor of the IG (0.71, 1.56, and 1.43 points of improvement, respectively) (Table 4).",93a10cf2-d7c1-4b4a-8007-92eaf538bbd0

Intragroup modifications: In the CG, the percentage of participants with medium/high adherence to the MD (AMD) index ranged from 36.7% in week one to 38.3% in week four. In the IG, the percentages showed higher differences throughout the 4 weeks of follow-up (from 41.1%, week 1, to 62.0%, week 4) (Figure 4).

Additionally, the responses to the usability rating questionnaire for e-12HR (with respect to “easy to complete”, “interesting to complete”, “understandable questions/feedbacks”, “to complete again”, and “time to complete”) were very positive. The usability of the application is a fundamental aspect. In fact, the three principle criteria demanded by healthcare professionals when selecting a “Nutrition & Diet” application for their clients/patients were [3]: ease of use (the ease of use was reflected in the very positive responses to the usability rating questionnaire for e-12HR), free of charge (download is free) and validation (based on the previous version of e-12HR which was previously validated [20,21,22,23,24]).",a1c21201-fe3d-4acf-ade4-c789748162e5
26,methods26,"  University students constitute a particularly interesting group to evaluate nutritional interventions to improve the diet for several reasons: (1) The Mediterranean diet is being abandoned, especially among the new generations [15]. (2) Among the younger generations, university students constitute a prominent subgroup since in the 2019/2020 academic year, there were 1309,762 undergraduate students enrolled in Spanish universities [34]. (3) University students are a population at high risk for having unhealthy habits [35] (with low adherence to the MD (AMD) index [25]) as they choose their own food, are very receptive to trends in diet such as slimming diets, skipped meals or consuming snacks, soft drinks, and other new products [36]. (4) University students lead an unhealthy lifestyle and are at risk of preserving these habits throughout adulthood, which represents a great inconvenience for these individuals, especially for students of the Health Sciences [37].",1b8f392d-7b6b-4b99-af36-d8cdb29ac8bf
27,methods27," Promoting healthy habits in the population at large, such as maintaining a good diet, is a primary task of these future professionals. Due to this, they should not just know the basics of these habits but practice them as well [38]. Ultimately, universities might provide the ideal forum to reach out to many young adults with nutrition education programs that can positively influence students’ unhealthy eating habits [39]. However, to the best knowledge of the research team, this study has been the first to evaluate an application for mobile telephones to increase adherence to the MD (AMD) among university students (specifically, Spanish university students at the Faculties of Medicine and Pharmacy).  A study that used an application with certain similarities to e-12HR was carried out by Choi et al. [40].",04bdda3f-0f92-4488-a461-85e879bfcf0e
28,methods28," In the study, the participants (patients presenting to the cardiology clinic of an academic medical center) used the application for 6 months, during which the Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) index was obtained initially, at one month, at 3 months, and at 6 months. The Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) increased significantly over time for both CG (from 7.1 to 8.4 points) and IG (from 7.2 to 8.8 points), although there was no statistically significant difference in these trends between the two groups. The proportion of participants that achieved high compliance (Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) ≥ 9) with the MD increased over time from the initial visit to the 6-month visit for both CG (from 18% to 57%) and IG (from 28% to 65%). However, when comparing CG with IG at each time point, there were no significant differences in Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) ≥ 9 at any of the time points (initial, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months).  Alonso-Dominguez et al.",4d97a098-dd66-4e38-a953-f39e228468a1
29,methods29," [41] also used another application with certain similarities to e-12HR. In the study, the participants (patients with type 2 diabetes) used the application for 12 months, during which the MEDAS index (score range 0 to 14 points) was obtained initially, at 3 months, and at 12 months. In the CG, the scores of the adherence to the MD (AMD) index showed no significant variations throughout the study (from 6.9 to 7.0 points). However, in the IG, a significant increase in the ADM index was observed in the follow-up visits with respect to the baseline visit (from 7.2 to 8.5 points). The percentage of participants with suitable ADM index (MEDAS score ≥ 9 points) showed few variations in the CG (ranging from 20% to 21%) and high variations in the IG (ranging from 22% to 50%). Regarding the intergroup modifications which occurred in follow-up visits, at the 3-month follow-up, compared to the baseline follow-up, there was a significant improvement in the adherence to the MD (AMD) index of 2.",5aacc744-9428-41d9-972a-c2d93fecbd21
30,methods30,"2 points in favor of the IG. At the same time, this improvement was maintained in the 12-month follow-up visit, with an increase of 1.3 points. At the 3- and 12-month follow-up visits, the percentage of participants with suitable adherence to the MD (AMD) index in the IG increased significantly compared to the CG (an increase of 52% and 29%, respectively).  Another study carried out by Gonzalez-Ramirez et al. [42], who also used a smartphone app with certain similarities to e-12HR, showed that the ADM score was significantly enhanced at month 3 with 1.4 points of improvement (intervention group only—no control group-).  The positive results of these studies [40,41,42] suggest that smartphone applications might represent an opportunity to promote ADM. McAleese et al.",28abe40d-4ed9-4aab-b061-3aa64025d59c
31,methods31," [43] carried out another study with the aim of evaluating the quality of commercially available applications (Google Play and Apple App Store) for the MD and the presence of behavioral change techniques (BCTs) used by these tools. The findings of this study suggest that currently available applications might provide information on the MD, but the incorporation of more BCTs is warranted to maximize the potential for behavioral change toward the MD.  The results of the present study, in line with the results obtained by Alonso-Dominguez et al., have shown a significant improvement in both the ADM index and the proportion of participants that achieved high compliance (Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS) ≥ 9) among the participants (university students) who used ‘feedback’ e-12HR (IG) compared to the participants who used ‘non-feedback’ e-12HR (CG). Furthermore, this improvement was observed over shorter follow-up periods than in other studies [40,41,42].",596691d7-d272-42f7-84ce-0b901fdcf506
32,methods32,"  This study has several limitations that should be noted when interpreting the results. First, the exposure to the intervention was short (28 days), and the long-term evolution of the adherence to the MD (AMD) index (once the follow-up period has ended) is unknown. In addition, the main findings of the study were based on patients’ responses: e-12HR application and usability rating questionnaire for e-12HR; e-12HR is a self-reporting method and, as a result, it has limitations inherent in this type of tool (amply described in the bibliography [30,31,44,45,46,47,48]). One of these limitations is its dependence on each participant’s memory and, above all, the difficulty of estimating the size of servings consumed. As far as memory is concerned, e-12HR attempts to reduce this disadvantage by only requiring short-term memory as the task is completed at the end of each day. In fact, the name e-12HR (electronic 12-Hour Dietary Recall) refers to how it differs from a 24-Hour Recall (24 h).",da4bcad2-5e31-4526-8310-db13cd37ae61
33,methods33," While a 24HR registers food group consumption from the day before, e-12HR allows users to record consumption on the same day (normally with 12 h max between food consumption and registration in the app). As for the difficulty of estimating the size of the servings consumed, we should take into account that to assess adherence to the MD (AMD), it is not required to have a precise estimate of the size of the foods consumed, but rather a precise recognition of the food groups consumed together with an approximate serving estimation [19]; to this end, e-12HR let participants collect data on consumption for all the food groups needed to calculate adherence to the MD (AMD). Alternative novel methods to determine dietary intake include audio signal processing, image processing, inertial sensing, non-intrusive near-infrared scanning, and also gesture recognition interfacing [49,50,51,52].",2391d3db-624d-448b-abf1-bdc3304eb7ba
34,methods34," Some authors maintain that more research is required to develop these tools, and others, which are more objective and precise, and that resources should be invested to do so [48]. Until these alternatives are available, despite their limitations, digital technologies used for self-report methods can, and must, be developed and used [20] as an improvement over traditional self-reporting methods. This progress constitutes one of the more important challenges that the field of nutritional epidemiology faces at present [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53]. Finally, another limitation of this study is that women were the majority of the participants (which is actually a reflection of the proportion of male and female students enrolled in the University of Seville’s Schools of Pharmacy and Medicine).",b762a1a2-ac36-4bb4-9a5e-5bedaea2955d
35,methods35,"  Future Research Related to the Current Study  Future research will be geared towards evaluating the effectiveness of using ‘feedback’ e-12HR (IG) versus the use of ‘non-feedback’ e-12HR (CG) in increasing adherence to the MD (AMD) index in different situations (e.g., among non-Health Science students, in non-school periods such as summer holidays, and considering different follow-up periods such as more than 28 days), as well as, over the long-term (after a period of time without using e-12HR).  5.",8ff71096-d24d-49bf-a50c-1032181eeb0f
36,methods36," Conclusions  The results of this study have been promising and suggest that the proposed intervention involving an application for mobile telephones (e-12HR) was relatively effective in the short term at improving the adherence to the MD (AMD) index among university students (a particularly interesting group with which to evaluate nutritional interventions to improve diet but, at the same time, a group not particularly concerned about dietary habits or their associated non communicable diseases) (NCD)s). Additionally, the usability of the application could be considered satisfactory. ",9b2b93e6-996e-4a2a-9eba-c8eecb678f47
