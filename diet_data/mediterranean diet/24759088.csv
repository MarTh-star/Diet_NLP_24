0,background0,"Age-related cognitive decline is rising as one of the world’s most detrimental health problems as the population ages. Although cognitive deterioration is considered an inevitable part of ageing, the rate and severity of cognitive decline is not homogenous among all individuals, ranging from normal age-related change, to mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), to chronic neurodegenerative disease (e.g. dementia, Alzheimer’s disease [AD], Parkinson’s disease) [1]. Of utmost concern is the fact that pathological brain disorders such as AD are presently considered incurable, with no current lasting pharmaceutical treatment options that are effective in stopping or reversing the progression of disease. The efficacy of current treatments available (e.g. donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine), at most, offer minor symptomatic relief for AD sufferers [2].",ad3fbd4c-42a7-4ce4-952d-2a035459f36c
1,background1,"  Recent evidence has provided emerging insight into modifiable lifestyle factors, such as diet, that may have an effect on slowing the onset and/or progression of age-related cognitive decline and promoting healthy cognitive ageing. In particular, the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MedDiet), rich in bioactive phytochemicals (e.g. constituents of olive oil, red wine, green leafy vegetables, fish, walnuts and seeds, such as antioxidants, fibre, vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated fat), and low in red meat, dairy products and processed foods, is leading the interest of researchers and the general public. In fact, an accumulating number of empirical studies [3-5], including a recent systematic review [6] have shown preliminary evidence for the efficacy of MedDiet intake on a range of age-related cognitive outcomes.",9c143c05-2ef0-4a31-904c-45c320a30666
2,background2," Collectively, such evidence indicates therapeutic potential for a MedDiet intervention to assist in protecting and preserving normal cognitive function in older age through slowing down the progression of cognitive decline and reducing risk of developing neurodegenerative pathologies [7].  The MedDiet approach to preserving better cognitive health in older age may be attractive to older adults, and also various governmental health agencies for a number of reasons. Firstly, the MedDiet is proposed as a potentially “natural” approach to reduce the onset of cognitive decline and prevent chronic neurological disorders (e.g. AD), as opposed to the alternative pharmaceutical approach. Improving cognitive function, life expectancy and overall health and well-being through diet and lifestyle modifications, may be a more favourable option for the elderly than using more stringent pharmacological alternatives.",43f62dfa-a678-49b5-b869-c4c0d1fe41b0
3,background3," Indeed, many pharmacological treatments have associated side effects that can be quite adverse for this population [2]. Secondly, with reduced prevalence of these disorders, it is likely there will be a subsequent reduction in associated socio-economic and disability burdens as well.  Cross-sectional and prospective studies A growing body of cross-sectional and prospective studies have found higher adherence to a MedDiet pattern is associated with improvements in a range of cognitive outcomes for healthy older adult populations including: slower global cognitive decline [5,8,9], higher episodic memory [5], global cognitive performance [10-15], higher verbal memory performance [14], even after adjustments for cofounds. In addition, a number of studies [16-18] have shown evidence for these associations among non-clinical populations.",fbf8f868-5514-4de2-a2fd-16b044d43024
4,background4,"  Although these findings appear encouraging, some studies report no beneficial effect of the MedDiet on age-related cognitive outcomes for healthy older individuals [19,20]. Thus, the question of whether adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern is beneficial to the normal (i.e. non-pathological) ageing brain remains equivocal at present.  Randomised controlled trials Without question, the only way of validating the efficacy of the MedDiet as a preventative approach for older adults will rest upon evidence from randomised controlled intervention trials (RCTs). However, to our knowledge, there has only been one published RCT on cognitive ageing outcomes among the elderly to date. Martínez-Lapiscina and colleagues [3] conducted a 6.5 year RCT in Spain, investigating the effects of a MedDiet intervention on global cognitive performance among 522 elderly participants at high risk of cardiovascular disease (i.e.",14ba8f03-c7c2-414f-9ca3-95b7cb86135c
5,background5," had to be carrying the presence of type-2 diabetes, or at least 3 major risk factors hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking and obesity). In a parallel-group, cardiovascular prevention trial, participants were randomised to either a MedDiet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)), a MedDiet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a low-fat control diet, and assessed on global cognitive functioning using the Mini-Mental State Examination (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)) [21] and a Spanish version of the Clock Drawing Test (Clock Drawing Test (CDT)) [22]. After 6.5 years of dietary intervention follow-up, results of this trial indicated that mean Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clock Drawing Test (CDT) scores were significantly higher for participants allocated to a MedDiet pattern supplemented with either extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or mixed nuts, compared with the control group.",df6e5b57-9f19-445b-b031-416e1181c3d7
6,background6," This finding provides further support to the hypothesised benefit of MedDiet intake on age-related cognition.  However, the evidence generated by this study is restricted to a specific population (i.e. older adults at high cardiovascular risk), and the results may not be generalisable to the wider elderly adult population. The range of cognitive tests utilised in the study was restricted, preventing a clear delineation of those specific aspects of cognition assisted through the dietary intervention. Consequently, it is not possible to determine the nature and range of cognitive functions critically impacted (e.g. speed of processing, executive functioning, attention) and how these relate to changing biological and neurological functioning.",ac7addaa-13d8-406a-90ad-d7ded82f723c
7,background7," This is an important gap to address in future RCTs because conclusions about the efficacy of a MedDiet pattern on change in age-related cognitive function cannot advance without generating a clearer understanding of how individual aspects of cognition, across all domains, are influenced by MedDiet intake during the normal ageing process [23].  Underlying mechanisms of the Mediterranean dietary pattern on age-related cognition To date, no clear mechanistic explanation has been documented regarding the inferred relationship between MedDiet intake and improved age-related cognitive function. However, preliminary evidence from prior observational studies has begun to shed some light on potential underlying factors that may be involved. Indeed, certain individual foods and their constituents found in the MedDiet pattern (i.e.",79a5335e-770e-4577-9a86-e42f989e49e8
8,background8," vitamins E, B6, B12, folate, monounsaturated fatty acids, fish, carotenoids, flavonoids, omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants) may be protective against the development of cognitive decline [24-26] possibly through a direct effect on brain physiology. When these foods and constituents are combined, it is assumed that the interrelated actions of a whole dietary pattern may generate even more powerful synergistic, additive or antagonist actions in the brain that single food factors are unable to achieve.  A second line of reasoning suggests biological mechanisms could also be implicated as underlying factors. Indeed, a growing body of studies have documented strong evidence showing the effect of nutrition on cardiovascular health, including the positive effect of the traditional MedDiet [27], and conversely, the inverse effect of the typical Western diet [28,29].",a19121cf-3926-4748-bf63-408126db9a07
9,background9," Of particular note, specific biological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin resistance and reduced cerebral blood flow have individually been postulated as key factors in the pathogenesis of both normal cognitive ageing and chronic neurodegenerative change [8,30-32].  Evidence that the MedDiet may reduce the risk of unsafe levels of these biological markers in the brain have been found in a number of recent studies. For example, Gu and colleagues [10] showed that adherence to a MedDiet pattern reduced inflammation markers C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 levels. Similarly, the MedDiet has also been found to reduce oxidative damage [33], which may affect the physiology of the ageing brain directly, by protecting neuronal and cell-signalling function and maintenance. Other recent studies have shown benefits of MedDiet adherence on endothelial function.",0ff90f9a-ecbc-4733-8ac8-93c42fa285d3
10,background10," Sorond and colleagues [34] found that consumption of a flavonol-rich cocoa drink for two weeks significantly increased cerebral blood flow velocity among healthy older adults. Given that the MedDiet is particularly rich in flavonoids, there is a potential for similar effects to occur in the brain, improving blood flow and overall endothelial function [35].  Taken together, we propose the underlying mechanisms of the MedDiet pattern on age-related cognitive health may be multifactorial, with associations between MedDiet food components, cardiovascular risk factors, and age-related cognitive function. In turn, this complex event may generate either direct effects on brain physiology at the neuronal and cellular level, or influence cognitive function more indirectly through improved cardiovascular health.

It was hypothesised that among a sample of non-demented, male and female Australian older adults aged 65 years and above, the MedDiet group would show significantly greater age-related cognitive performance in aspects of fluid cognitive ability when compared with the habitual dietary control group over six months.  Secondary aims were: 1.",0ff64d50-0141-4c0f-bd97-427e337c2b0a
13,methods2," to explore whether the effect of MedDiet intake on age-related cognitive functioning is mediated by hsCRP (biomarker of inflammation), F2-isoprostanes (biomarker of oxidative stress in vivo), metabolic biomarkers (lipids, glucose, insulin), and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (middle cerebral artery (MCA)); 2. to determine whether psychological well-being factors (stress, sleep, anxiety, depression) moderate the strength of association between MedDiet intake and age-related cognitive performance.  Study design The MedLey study is a 6-month, randomised, controlled, 2-cohort parallel group comparison intervention trial, with repeated measures every three months, over three time points, to assess the effects of a MedDiet pattern with a habitual Western dietary pattern on age-related cognitive performance and cardiometabolic health. Due to the sheer extremity and length of the assessment process, a rolling recruitment was used over two cohorts (i.e.",102b2d44-6adf-4626-a2c4-7f2809ac1c9a

Both cohort 1 and cohort 2 involved equivalent methods of recruitment, screening, assessment, and the same dietitians and researchers conducting the assessments and dietary consultations. Hence, collectively, the total study length of the trial involving the two cohorts was approximately 18 months in total. In accordance with the CONSORT statement [36], a flow diagram of participants intended progress throughout the intervention trial is documented (see Figure 1).Figure 1 Flow diagram of the overall study design for the MedLey trial.    Participant recruitment Based on power and sample size calculations (see Power below), an initial sample of 166 healthy Australian men and women aged 65 years and above, with normal cognitive function and proficient in English language, were recruited from metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia through response to public advertisements in local broadcast and print (i.e.",4981a534-8c0e-4eb5-9994-4953c2be5fba

Participation in the MedLey trial was entirely voluntary, and participants were informed they were free to withdraw at any stage during the trial. Participants were provided with an honorarium of $100, to reimburse for study related expenses (e.g. parking fees).  Participant screening and selection Volunteers who expressed interested and responded to the study advertisements were sent an information pack and questionnaires to collect further information regarding their general health and medical history. The information pack included the following: a cover letter, participant information sheet including any risks associated with participation in the study, a pre-screening diet and lifestyle questionnaire (diet and lifestyle questionnaire (DLQ)), map, and also a reply paid envelope.",9a19211f-66db-405b-9ce9-5c3c1090824f

17,methods6,"  As the population of interest for the MedLey RCT was healthy older adults (≥65 years), it was imperative to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. A validated screening instrument; the DemTect [37] was chosen for this purpose. The DemTect includes five subtests: 1. a word list task to assess immediate and delayed recall, 2. a number transcending task, where participants translate numerals to number words and vice-versa (e.g. 100 to one hundred) to assess language, 3. a semantic verbal fluency task [items found in a supermarket task], and 4. a digit span task to assess working memory). Together, these subtests cover a diverse assessment of particular cognitive functions known to be sensitive to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, with high sensitivity in detecting early AD (sensitivity of 100%) and also in detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (sensitivity of 80%).",34d53514-01f6-45db-a514-7680e9d4dc6b

Scoring of the DemTect followed the standard protocol outlined by Kalbe and colleagues [37]. Firstly, each of the five subtest raw scores were adjusted for age and education. Subsequently, the five transformed subtest scores were summed together to provide an overall DemTect score for each participant, which was classified as either: ‘appropriate for their age’ (score 13–18), ‘mild cognitive impairment’ (score 9–12), or ‘suspected dementia’ (score ≤8).

This version of the Stroop Test consists of two alternate trials using one stimulus card that contains a list of 176 colour words printed in incongruous ink (e.g. the word “blue” printed in yellow ink), and randomly ordered. In the first trial participants are asked to read the words while ignoring the colours they are printed in, as quickly as they can, going across the page line by line. In the second trial, participants are asked to name the colours in which the words are printed while ignoring the words themselves. Scores are based on the time taken to complete each task, and also the time taken to reach the half way point. As standard, two performance scores are generated for the Stroop Test; the time taken to complete each trial. From these scores, an interference score is then calculated, which represents the ratio of the time taken to name colours divided by the time taken to read words.",0e5a51df-712a-4dde-b060-980eeb4e75db
37,methods26," Higher scores reflect higher levels of interference and therefore poorer performance. The additional time taken to perform the second subtask compared with the first subtask is commonly referred to as the “Stroop interference effect”, and reflects an individual’s degree of interference control. In addition, the number of corrected and uncorrected errors produced by the participant is also collected for the ability to assess the severity of impaired performance on this test [45]. The Stroop interference score has been found to correlate moderately well with other measures of attention involving continuous performance tasks (R2 = .310 [46], providing evidence for construct validity. Furthermore, good test-retest reliability (r = .90) has been documented for this version [47]. Alternate forms of this test was used and counterbalanced across participants over the three treatment arms to reduce potential practice effects.",6e09415c-6b60-4c97-8af1-fac83d891a5c
38,methods27,"  Strategic retrieval search Two measures of verbal fluency, namely the Initial Letter Fluency (Initial Letter Fluency (ILF)) and the Excluded Letter Fluency (Excluded Letter Fluency (ELF)) tests, are administered. In the Initial Letter Fluency (ILF) [43] participants are asked to produce as many words beginning with a particular letter as quickly as they can in 60 seconds, without using words that begin with a capital letter for a brand, place or person (e.g. for the letter C “Canberra or Christine”), words that are numbers (e.g. “eight”), or the same word that ends with a different ending (e.g. “catch, catching”). Finally, participants must name words that contain more than three letters. Participants are asked to repeat this process for two letters (for F and then for S) or (L and C, alternate form), on two separate 60 second trials.",01c373a2-cea9-4e25-9672-b6c80b60efda
39,methods28," A total Initial Letter Fluency (ILF) performance score on this task represents the number of words correctly produced across the two trials, summed together. Bryan and colleagues [48] found a moderate alternate form reliability coefficient (r = .72) for the Initial Letter Fluency (ILF) test. In the Excluded Letter Fluency (ELF), participants were asked to produce as many words as possible that do not contain the letter E (on the first trial, or R, alternate form), and then not containing the letter A (on the second trial, or T, alternate form). Scores on both trials were then summed together to produce an overall Excluded Letter Fluency (ELF) score. Evidence for moderate alternate form reliability for the Excluded Letter Fluency (ELF) (r = .61) was found by Bryan et al. [48]. Alternate forms of both the Initial Letter Fluency (ILF) and the Excluded Letter Fluency (ELF) were used and counterbalanced across participants over the three treatment arms.",19ce73b1-fe05-45e7-bfd3-0bb4757e4680
40,methods29,"  Planning D-KEFS [49] version of the Tower of London (Tower of London (TOL)) test is used to measure executive functions, particularly spatial planning (i.e. the ability to problem solve in a way that involves mentally visualizing the outcome prior to physically carrying out the action) [49], as well as inhibition and rule learning. In a series of nine different problems, participants are asked to move a set of five disks from a starting configuration, which has three vertical pegs on top of a wooden platform. The aim is to move the set of disks to the specified goal configuration in the least number of moves possible, while overcoming two specific restrictions (i.e. a larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk and only one disk can be moved at a time). Scores on the Tower of London (TOL) represent the total number of permitted moves made across all the items relative to the minimum number of moves required to solve the problems, the number of violations (i.e.",a08d1866-b340-4b9a-8380-13c116027efd
41,methods30," illegal moves) made, and also the total time taken to complete the tasks, which provides an index of an individual’s spatial planning ability, and learning strategy ability. Taken together, fewer moves used to successfully construct the towers of items 1 through to 9, and less time taken, represents greater executive functioning ability. High internal consistency for The D-KEFS Tower Test among older adults has been found by Delis, Kaplan and Kramer [49], with intercorrelations between test items ranging from .61 to .72.  Memory Episodic recall and recognition Rey and Schmidt’s [50] Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)) is used to assess episodic verbal recall and recognition. In the first trial, the examiner reads a list of 15 words (List A) at a rate of one word per second and asks the participant to repeat back as many words as they can remember, in any order.",bb1fa1c2-9533-4df8-a148-2696f3126709
42,methods31," The examiner then reads the same list of 15 words aloud and asks the participant to again recall the list of words. This process continues for trials 3, 4 and 5. In trial six, the examiner reads aloud a second list of 15 different words (List B), and asks the participant to repeat back as many words as they can remember. Immediately after recall of List B, participants are then asked to recall as many words from List A as they can remember. In trial seven, following a 20 minute delay, the examiner then asks the participant to recall as many words as they can remember from List A. Finally, the participant is shown an A4 sheet of printed words that contained a total of 30 words from both List A and B, as well as 20 distracter words not appearing in either list. They are then asked to circle the words they identified as being read aloud, and also indicate whether they were from the first or second list of words by placing a “1” or “2’ next to the words they have circled.",fd855cde-c00e-4714-80bb-9157fe58172a
43,methods32," Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) performance scores consisted of the sum of words recalled from the five trials of List A, words recalled after a delay, and those recognised. The validity of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) in identifying memory impairment has been shown by Tierney and colleagues [51] who found healthy elderly participants performed significantly better on all measures of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) compared with demented patients with either Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease. Evidence for good test-retest reliability for the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) has been found by Knight, McMahon, Green and Skeaff [52]. Alternate forms of Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) (A, B and C) was used and counterbalanced across participants over the three treatment arms.",5ca1fa00-4452-4dc5-80b5-33a5339ebf30
44,methods33,"  Short-term memory and working memory The Digit Span Forward (Digit Span Forward (DSF)), Digit Span Backward (Digit Span Backward (DSB)) and the Letter-Number sequencing (Letter Number sequencing (LNS)) subtest tasks from the latest version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) [53], are used to measure short term memory (Digit Span Forward (DSF)) and working memory (Digit Span Backward (DSB) and Letter Number sequencing (LNS)). For Digit Span Forward (DSF), participants are read a consecutive string of numbers (from 1–9) at a rate of one per second, and asked to repeat them back in the exact order they are presented. For the Digit Span Backward (DSB) task, participants are asked to repeat the sequence of numbers back in the exact reverse order that they were presented. String lengths range from two to eight digits and each trial presented two lists of the same string length.",b9df6bc9-4f44-4b54-b6b2-c46f14464481
45,methods34," For each one of the eight trails over the two Digit Span tasks, a score of zero is given if a participant makes an incorrect response, and a score of 1 was given for a correct response. Individual total raw scores for the Digit Span Forward (DSF) and Digit Span Backward (DSB) tasks is calculated by summing the accumulated scores for the eight trials administered to each separate task. The maximum total raw score for both the Digit Span Forward (DSF) and the Digit Span Backward (DSB) was 16.  For the Letter Number sequencing (LNS) task, participants are presented with strings of numbers and letters at a rate of one item per second, and afterwards asked to repeat back the numbers in numerical order followed by the letters in alphabetical order. String lengths ranged from two to eight digits and letters, and each trial presented three lists of the same string length.",3fd65d94-6e60-42d4-bc89-adc28d3d2b13
46,methods35," Following standard scoring procedures as outlined in the test manual [53], all seven trials (with three test items per trial) (not including sample items) were given a score of 0, 1, 2 or 3 (0 = fails all three trials, 1 = passes one trial, 2 = passes two trials, 3 = passes all three trials). For trials one and two, a score of 0 is given if a participant provides an incorrect response, suggesting they did not know the answer, or did not provide an answer within the allocated time limit of 30 seconds. For trials three to ten, credit is given for providing the correct letters in sequence followed by the correct letters in sequence.  Psychometrically, the Digit Span Forward (DSF) and the Digit Span Backward (DSB) tasks of the Digit Span subtest of the WAIS-IV [53] have been reported to have good to excellent internal consistency reliability (r = .81 for the Digit Span Forward (DSF), and r = .93 for the Digit Span Backward (DSB)) for older adult populations [54].",73ad4a80-df80-4de0-831e-c1843cee8c20
47,methods36," A confirmatory factor analysis of the WAIS-IV (model 5) revealed the Digit Span subtest loaded onto the Working Memory factor .76, suggesting the internal structure of the test captures the content area reasonably well. Letter-number sequencing from the WAIS-IV has been reported to be a reliable subtest (r = .88), and shown correlate better with the Digit Span subtest than any other subtest of the WAIS-IV, indicating it is indeed measuring memory [55].  Visual-spatial memory The Benton Visual Retention Test (Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT)) [56] has been employed to assess visual-spatial memory ability, visual-motor construction ability and visual perception. Following standard administrative and scoring procedure [56], participants are shown 10 consecutive geometric designs for 10 seconds each. Once the participant has had 10 seconds viewing time, the design is hidden from view and they are instructed to reproduce the design from memory by drawing it on paper.",39c998b4-b186-4efe-9873-5b2040bb5d3e
48,methods37," Performance is scored as described in the test manual [57] with two generated outcomes; 1. the total number of correctly reproduced designs (0–10), and 2. the total number of errors produced (0–10) that fall under six categories: distortions, rotations, omissions, preservations, size, and misplacements. Psychometrically, the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) has been found to have good discriminant validity in the way it distinguishes dementia from the effects of normal ageing [58]. Moderate test-retest reliability for the Expected Number Correct Score (r = .78), along with a relatively low test-retest reliability coefficient for the Error score (r = .57) has been documented by prior research [59]. Alternate forms of the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) (C, D and E) was used and counterbalanced across participants over the three treatment arms.",818f0177-326f-4bd7-8bda-dec8c1fe0de9
49,methods38,"  Speed of processing and visual-motor coordination The Symbol Search and Coding core subtests from the WAIS IV [53] were employed to measure processing speed. The Symbol Search task involves participants scanning a search group of symbols and indicating whether one of the symbols in the target group matched. If a match was found, the participants are instructed to draw a line through the shape. Alternatively, if there was no match, the participant is instructed to draw a line through the NO box. There are 60 items in this test, and participants are asked to complete as many as possible within 120 seconds. Symbol Search subtest has 60 items and participants are asked to complete as many as possible within 120 seconds. The total raw score for Symbol Search is calculated as standard [53] by subtracting the total number of incorrect responses from the total number of correct responses (maximum score = 60).",fdd22d61-cd7d-4d4a-b85d-83c70db63c42
50,methods39,"  The Coding subtest has 135 items and requires participants to work within a time limit of 120 seconds. Participants are asked to copy symbols that are paired with numbers in the correct order, as quickly as possible, without making mistakes or skipping any. Participants are given one point for each correctly drawn symbol made in the allocated time limit of 120 seconds, not including sample items. The total raw score for Coding is calculated as the number of symbols correctly drawn within the 120 second time limit (maximum score = 135). Numerous studies documented in the Technical and Interpretative Manual [53] examining the psychometric properties of the WAIS IV’s Symbol Search and Coding subtests, support the validity and reliability of these measures. The test items within the Coding and Symbol Search subtests correlate highly with each other, and also load onto the “Processing Speed” factor better than any other subtest in the WAIS-IV (i.e. Coding .83 and Symbol Search .",17eca5a3-4117-413c-ae0d-c646eed2820e

Psychological well-being measures Evidence from past research has indicated that depression and anxiety [60] stress [61] and sleep [62] can all individually affect cognitive function. Thus, it was deemed important to determine whether any differences between the two dietary groups could result from differences in these variables. Therefore, depression, anxiety, stress and sleep quality are assessed in the MedLey RCT to control for potential confounding variables.  The following psychological well-being instruments are utilised in the current study: 1. the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y (STAI-Y) [63] to measure symptoms of anxiety; 2. the Perceived Stress scale (Perceived Stress scale (PSS)) [64] to measure subjective stress levels; 3.",79c32f9c-d03d-4bfd-9987-8cb4a11f3b5d

The left transtemporal window (i.e. between the left ear and alongside the zygomatic bone) is used for insonation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Assessments of the mean flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is then recorded at a depth of 50 ± 10 mm for each cardiac cycle throughout the entire 180 seconds, and performed three times with a two minute rest period, for optimum test reliability. A fitted spline curve is used to smooth data collected during hypercapnia, which provides the ability to determine the peak increase in mean flow velocity. middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (middle cerebral artery (MCA)V) is expressed as a percentage change from baseline [(peak mean flow velocity-baseline mean flow velocity) * 100/baseline mean flow velocity].",de5fa5f1-c083-46b0-b4af-14a5b6b32c4a

For the secondary analysis, a series of bivariate Pearson correlations and a multiple mediation model using a bootstrapping approach will be conducted to assess whether the total and indirect effects of inflammatory, oxidative stress and metabolic biomarkers mediate the effect of diet (i.e. MedDiet and HabDiet) on age-related cognitive performance.
