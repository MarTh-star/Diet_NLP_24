0,methods0," Study population  This study is embedded within the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project , a collaborative project across six established and ongoing longitudinal population-based birth cohort studies in Europe: Born in Bradford (BiB, UK) , Étude des Déterminants pré et postnatals du développement et de la santé de l’Enfant (EDEN, France) , Kaunas Cohort (KANC, Lithuania) , INfancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA, Spain) , Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa, Norway) , and RHEA (RHEA, Greece) (Chatzi et al., 2017a). Participating cohorts covered singleton deliveries from 2003 to 2008.",30fbd6e6-a09c-470a-a2d4-d658996a76e3
1,methods1," As part of Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX), a subcohort of 1301 children (approximately 200 children in each cohort) were followed in 2014–2015 for a clinical examination, a computer-assisted interview with the parents, and the collection of biological samples. Data collection was standardized across cohorts and performed by trained staff. A full description of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) follow-up methods and study population are provided by Maitre et al., 2018. Prior to the start of Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX), all six cohorts on which Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) is based had undergone the required evaluation by national ethics committees and had obtained all the required permissions for their cohort recruitment and follow-up visits. Each cohort also confirmed that relevant informed consent and approval were in place for secondary use of data from preexisting data.",7d909f46-e8e7-41a9-82a1-893b243743b2
2,methods2," The work in Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) was covered by new ethics approvals from the local ethics committees at each site, and at enrolment in the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) subcohort, participants were asked to sign an informed consent form for the specific Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) work including clinical examination and biospecimen collection and analysis. Additionally, the current study was approved by the University of Southern California Institutional Review Board.  Our study population consisted of 1147 children with available information on dietary intake, plasma C-peptide levels, and metabolomic biomarkers in urine collected during the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) follow-up at a mean age of 7.9 years (range: 5.4–12.0 years) (Figure 1).  Figure 1. Participant flowchart.",934d127c-88bd-4795-a8df-10c98594e74b
3,methods3,"  Dietary assessment  Information about the children’s habitual diet was collected via a semi quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) covering the child’s habitual diet, which was filled in by the parent attending the examination appointment. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), covering the past year, was developed by the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) research group, translated and applied to all cohorts . It included 43 questions of intake of food items, which were aggregated in 16 main food groups: meat and meat products, fish and seafood, sweets, beverages, potatoes, vegetables, dairy products, fruits, bread and cereal, sweet bakery products, added fats, eggs, nuts, salty snacks, pulses, and dressings. It also included 15 specific questions to examining the degree of adherence to Mediterranean diet.",41a0e746-e67d-4921-8945-754377c5bf8b
4,methods4," Diet quality was assessed using two different approaches, (1) by assessing the degree of adherence to a Mediterranean diet based on the KIDMED index (Mediterranean Diet Quality Index for children and adolescents) (Serra-Majem et al., 2004) and (2) by assessing the proportion of ultra processed food (UPF) in the overall diet .  For the KIDMED index (Serra-Majem et al., 2004), items positively associated with the Mediterranean diet pattern (11 items) were assigned a value of +1, while those negatively associated with the Mediterranean diet pattern (4 items) were assigned a value of −1 (Supplementary file 1a). The scores for all 15 items were summed, resulting in a total KIDMED score ranging from −4 to 11, with higher scores reflecting greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet. We categorized the score into three groups: low (<1), moderate (1–4), and high (>4).",6315dc15-e3d8-4a49-bca0-beb2972479b8
5,methods5,"  For ultra processed food (UPF) intake, we identified foods and drinks as ‘ultra-processed’ by using the NOVA classification, a food classification system based on the nature, extent, and purpose of industrial food processing  We identified the following ‘ultra-processed’ foods: cookies, pastries, sugar-sweetened, low-sugar and artificially sweetened beverages, cold meat cuts; ham, dairy desserts, sugar-sweetened and other breakfast cereals, crispbread and rusks; chocolate, sweets, margarine, dressings, and salty snacks. For some food items, our food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) did not provide enough information on food processing to determine if a specific item belongs to one processing category or another.",1853a1e9-8f18-4db3-af10-f31a616ae62c
6,methods6," We discussed the classification of each food item with a team of nutritionists and used a conservative approach, such that the lower level of processing was chosen – for instance, we made the assumption that fries are homemade from fresh potatoes, and therefore, they were not classified as ultra processed food (UPF). For each child, we calculated the daily proportion of all ultra processed food (UPF) in the total diet as the ratio between the sum of daily servings of ultra processed food (UPF) to the total daily sum of all food and drink servings. More details on the categorization of foods according to the NOVA classification are presented in Supplementary file 1b.  Urine metabolite profiling  Two urine samples, representing last night-time and first morning voids, were collected on the evening and morning before the clinical examination, kept in a fridge and transported in a temperature-controlled environment, and aliquoted and frozen within 3 hr of arrival at the clinics.",49baa1ba-64a2-4397-9186-0d29b163175c
7,methods7," They were subsequently pooled to generate a more representative sample of the last 24 hr for metabolomic analysis .  Urinary metabolic profiles were acquired using 1H NMR spectroscopy according to Lau et al., 2018. In brief one-dimensional 600 MHz 1H NMR spectra of urine samples from each cohort were acquired on the same Bruker Avance III spectrometer operating at 14.1 Tesla within a period of 1 month. The spectrometer was equipped with a Bruker SampleJet system, and a 5-mm broadband inverse configuration probe maintained at 300 K. Prior to analysis, cohort samples were randomized. Deuterated 3-(trimethylsilyl)-[2,2,3,3-d4]-propionic acid sodium salt was used as internal reference. Aliquots of the study pooled quality control (QC) sample were used to monitor analytical performance throughout the run and were analysed at an interval of every 23 samples (i.e., 4 QC samples per well plate).",ff62db34-517f-43ab-86f6-799ea158676b
8,methods8," The 1H NMR spectra were acquired using a standard one-dimensional solvent suppression pulse sequence. Forty-four metabolites were identified and quantified as described in Lau et al., 2018. The urinary NMR showed excellent analytical performance, the mean coefficient of variation across the 44 NMR detected urinary metabolites was 11%. For the statistical analysis we have used creatinine-normalized metabolite concentrations (μmol/mmol of creatinine).  Plasma C-peptide  Blood was collected at the end of the clinical examination during the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) follow-up visit. The median postprandial interval (time between last meal and blood collection) was 3.3 hr (interquartile range [IQR: 2.8–4.0]).  For each cohort, concentration of C-peptide was assessed in child plasma at the CRG/ultra processed food (UPF) Proteomics Unit (Barcelona, Spain) using the xMAP and Luminex System multiplex platform according to the manufacturer’s protocol.",7a738814-9547-4f31-a1b1-94851fd4d5e4
9,methods9," Blood samples were randomized and blocked by cohort prior to measurement to ensure a representation of each cohort in each plate (batch). For protein quantification, an 8-point calibration curve per plate was performed with protein standards provided in the Luminex kit and following the procedures described in the standard procedures described by the vendor. Commercial heat inactivated, sterile-filtered plasma from human male AB plasma (Sigma Cat # H3667) was used as constant controls to control for intra- and interplate variability. Four control samples were added per plate. Raw intensities obtained with the xMAP and Luminex system for each sample were converted to pg/ml using the calculated standard curves of each plate and accounting for the dilutions that were made prior measurement. The coefficient of variation for C-peptide was 16%. The LOD was determined and the lower and upper quantification limits (LOQ1 and LOQ2, respectively) were obtained from the calibration curves.",51609981-29e8-4467-9942-0ed5c6b171d9
10,methods10," C-peptide concentrations were log2-transformed to achieve normal distribution. Plate batch effect was corrected by subtracting for each individual and each protein the difference between the overall protein average minus the plate-specific protein average. Finally, values below LOQ1 and above LOQ2 were imputed using a truncated normal distribution using the truncdist R package.  Covariates  Adjustment factors were selected a priori based on literature (Aranceta et al., 2003; Scaglioni et al., 2018; Patrick and Nicklas, 2005) and included: maternal age (in years), maternal education level (low, middle, high), maternal prepregnancy body mass index (body mass index (BMI), in kg/m2), family affluence score (cohort-specific definition of low, middle, high), child sex, child age (in years), child body mass index (BMI) (in kg/m2), child sedentary behavior (min/day of time spent watching TV, playing computer games or other sedentary games), child ethnicity (White European, Asian, other),",d9e4e971-2047-453e-8dd2-c310c7f8b90b
11,methods11," and postprandial interval (in hours). We also included a cohort indicator as a fixed effect in the models, as this, in the context of an observational study, is expected to control for cohort effects . We imputed missing values for covariates (ranging from 0% to 4%) using the method of chained equations with the R package mice. Details about the imputation process in Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX), diagnostics, and comparison between imputed and complete-case values have been reported in detail elsewhere . ",d7ab44d0-35ea-42dd-a651-f80de66ade0e
12,analysis0," As a first step in our analysis, we conducted a metabolome-wide association study to assess the associations of urinary metabolites with diet quality. Creatinine-normalized metabolite concentrations (μmol/mmol of creatinine) were log10 transformed prior to statistical analyses to improve model fit. We fitted separate multivariable regression models for each metabolite with the KIDMED score or ultra processed food (UPF) intake (expressed as per 5% change of total daily food intake). To account for multiple hypothesis testing, we applied the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (false discovery rate (FDR)) correction; an false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p value <0.05 denoted statistical significance. For metabolites identified to be associated with the diet quality indicators, we assessed between-cohort heterogeneity with the I2 statistic and χ2 test from Cochran’s Q.  To examine the ability of the identified metabolite panels in discriminating children with low vs.",92be868a-23de-447c-a838-8ecb1c19d656
13,analysis1," high KIDMED scores (<1 vs. >4) and low vs. high ultra processed food (UPF) intakes (Quartile 1: <18% vs. Quartile 4: ≥29%), we plotted receiver operating characteristic (receiver operating characteristic (ROC)) curves and estimated area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve values, indicative of the discriminative performance of the metabolite models, based on tenfold cross validations. We also repeated the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for a set of established sociodemographic factors (maternal education level, maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), family affluence score, child sedentary behavior, ethnicity, age, and sex) linked to childhood diet quality both previously (Aranceta et al., 2003; Scaglioni et al., 2018; Patrick and Nicklas, 2005) and in our study population (all p < 0.05) and compared the discriminative performance of this sociodemographic set with that of the metabolites.",d9b7985a-846e-4414-91f7-018f883732f5
14,analysis2,"  Next, we examined the association of the KIDMED score and of ultra processed food (UPF) intake (as independent variables) with plasma C-peptide concentration (as dependent variable) using multivariable linear regression models. No departures from linearity in the associations of these diet quality indicators with C-peptide concentration were observed both visually and statistically (p for linearity >0.42) using generalized additive models. We examined the KIDMED score both as continuous (per score unit increase) and in categories of low (score <1, reference), moderate (score = 1–4), and high (score >4). Likewise, ultra processed food (UPF) intake was assessed both as continuous (per 5% change of total daily food intake) and in quartiles (Q1: <18%, reference; Q2: 18% to <23%; Q3: 23% to <29%; and Q4: ≥29% of total daily food intake).",35057fae-ede5-49ce-8141-dc279e44f495
15,analysis3," We also included a product term between KIDMED and ultra processed food (UPF) intake in the regression analysis to assess their interaction; to simplify interpretation of this model, we categorized the KIDMED score as low/moderate vs. high and ultra processed food (UPF) intake based on the median population intake ( <23% vs. ≥23%). We conducted two sets of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results. First, we calculated cohort-specific effect estimates and assessed heterogeneity with the I2 statistic and χ2 test from Cochran’s Q. Second, we examined potential effect modification by child sex and by child weight status (international (IOTF)-defined normal weight vs. overweight/obese) on C-peptide by testing the multiplicative interaction term between the potential effect modifier and each diet quality measure.",5dbca847-0404-466a-b8cc-5c88868d0a60
16,analysis4," Finally, we fitted regression models with the metabolites found to be associated with diet quality indicators, and C-peptide in order to assess whether diet-related metabolites are related to β-cell function.  We performed analyses with both complete (missingness <4% in each covariate) and imputed data. Results were similar across raw and imputed data analyses, and hence, we present those using the imputed covariate data. For easier interpretation of effect estimates for the log-transformed C-peptide and metabolite values, we back-transformed regression coefficients and present results as percent change (% change = (back-transformed [beta] − 1) × 100).  Analyses were conducted using STATA version 14.2 (StataCorp LLC, TX) and R software version 3.5.3. Linear regression analyses were performed in STATA with the command ‘regress’ and using ‘mi estimate’ to account for the imputed covariate data (StataCorp, 2021).",1fc0a28b-5370-4d18-9fea-b35932d55f56

KIDMED and ultra processed food (UPF) intake were negatively correlated (Spearman r = −0.44); children with high and low (<1) KIDMED score had a mean (SD) ultra processed food (UPF) intake of 18.8 (6.6)% and 33.4 (9.9)%, respectively. The two diet quality scores were associated with most recorded food intakes in opposite directions (Supplementary file 1c, d). Daily fruit and vegetable consumption, weekly fish consumption and not skipping breakfast were the major dietary habits differentiating children with low and high KIDMED score (Supplementary file 1c).

A higher KIDMED score was also associated with higher acetate and pantothenic acid concentrations, while tyrosine and valine concentrations were inversely associated with ultra processed food (UPF) intake. There was no evidence of significant between-cohort heterogeneity in the associations between the diet quality indicators and these metabolites ( <30%; p for heterogeneity >0.2). receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses showed that the combination of four metabolites associated with both diet quality indicators performed better than individual metabolites in discriminating children with high and low KIDMED scores and ultra processed food (UPF) intake (Figure 4).",7541d65b-3301-4cd0-a161-e2dc629888e0

33,discussion1,"  Previous studies assessing the metabolic response of the body to diet have largely focused on specific foods groups, Collins et al., 2019 yet humans eat a combination of foods that may have additive or interactive effects on human physiology. In our study, we assessed two diet quality indices to better describe the complexity of overall diet. The Mediterranean diet is characterized by high intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grain products, fish and low intakes of red meat and sweets, and it has long been appraised for its cardiometabolic benefits, even in children. (Chatzi et al., 2017b) Moreover, we assessed ultra processed food (UPF) intake to characterize the intake of industrial processed and prepared food items, with altered food structure, nutritional content, and taste .",8e48fe65-c2fc-4bfb-a02c-ed2e17fea683
34,discussion2," ultra processed food (UPF) intake assessment diverts from the traditional strategy of studying nutrients, foods, or dietary patterns to identify the link between diet with health and disease, and it reflects the cumulative intake of artificial substances (i.e. flavorings, colorings, emulsifiers, and other additives) and processing byproducts. Effects of ultra processed food (UPF) consumption are likely to be the result of synergistic effects of many food ingredient compound and characteristics, and high consumption of ultra processed food (UPF) has been proposed to lead to metabolic dysregulation .  For both KIDMED and ultra processed food (UPF), there was a common panel of four urinary metabolites (hippurate, N-methylnicotinic acid, urea, and sucrose), exhibiting an opposite pattern of association.",7d08e363-46fb-4377-b1cf-bd4730a5cb0e
35,discussion3," In addition, KIDMED was positively associated with pantothenic acid and acetate, whereas ultra processed food (UPF) was negatively associated with two amino acids, valine and tyrosine. These metabolic signatures demonstrate a core common metabolic biomarker panel reflecting habitual dietary intake, but also show that the two diet quality indices and their metabolic signatures act complementary and can highlight different aspects of human metabolism and physiology. Our finding are consistent with previous metabolomics studies conducted in adults (Garcia-Perez et al., 2017; Garcia-Perez et al., 2020; Almanza-Aguilera et al., 2017). Four dietary interventions were developped (Garcia-Perez et al., 2017) with similar energy content and within the World Health Organization (WHO healthy eating guidelines), but with varying macro- and micronutrient intake.",3fb25961-6e66-4f90-b924-4ae901830dc3
36,discussion4," The urine metabolic profile for the diet most concordant with the guidelines, characterized by high intakes of dietary fiber (through fruits, vegetables, and whole grain cereal products) and low intakes of fat, sugar, and salt showed systematic differences for a total of 28 metabolites, including increased levels of acetate, hippurate, N-methylnicotinic acid, and urea, compared to the diet that diverted from the healthy guidelines (Garcia-Perez et al., 2017). The PREDIMED study also used NMR to define urinary biomarkers associated with a high adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern in adults and the proposed biomarkers also included higher levels of urea (Almanza-Aguilera et al., 2017). To our knowledge, our study is the first to show the urinary metabolic footprint of total ultra processed food (UPF) intake, and also the first to show that urine NMR-derived scores of diet quality are reflective of a key biomarker of metabolic health, C-peptide, in healthy children.",aebb1601-601b-4198-9ae0-6e0362f639e3
37,discussion5," The ability to use a rapid, noninvasive biofluid screen to measure objective biomarkers of diet quality in children opens new avenues for exploring the significance of nutritional patterns to healthy development early in life.  Among the diet-related urinary metabolites, sucrose individually reflected the associations observed between diet quality and C-peptide (World Health Organization, 2015). Elevated levels of added sugars could lead to elevated glucose load in the human body, which in turn can lead to an increase in glycemic response and, thus, C-peptide production in healthy populations. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one previous study from Mexico examining the relation of diet to C-peptide in children . Similar to our findings, this study showed that adherence to a prudent dietary pattern characterized by food groups commonly consumed in Mediterranean diet (vegetables, fruit, fish, and legumes) was associated with low C-peptide levels in boys.",c006526d-9f05-4d45-9ab2-737171b1d27b
38,discussion6," Regarding other markers of glucose regulation, our findings are in line with previous studies in children and adults reporting that low adherence to a healthy dietary pattern or high consumption of specific ultra processed food (UPF)s (sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed meat) were associated with impaired glucose regulation and insulin resistance (Manios et al., 2010; Asghari et al., 2016; Chan She Ping-Delfos et al., 2015; McKeown et al., 2018; Ley et al., 2014; Fiorito et al., 2009). Overall, our findings are consistent with the public health concerns raised by the WHO, relating poor overall quality with high intake level of sugars and added sugars, and with poor metabolic health and a high risk of several noncommunicable diseases (World Health Organization, 2015; Stanhope et al., 2013; WHO Study Group, 1990; WHO, 2003).",284077b7-dfa6-46e6-b819-3593b8342743
39,discussion7,"  Regarding the other urinary metabolites reflecting diet quality, hippurate is a normal component of urine, a metabolic product of phenolic compounds which are present in various dietary sources. It is also a biomarker of fruit/vegetable intake, as it has been confirmed in previous studies in healthy children, adolescents  and adults  N-methylnicotinic acid (trigonelline) is a product of the metabolism of niacin (vitamin B3) and a biomarker of various dietary sources like legumes (Sri Harsha et al., 2018) and fruits . Urea is the principal end product of amino acids and protein catabolism and a potential marker of protein intake from food (Garcia-Perez et al., 2020).  In addition, adherence to the Mediterranean diet was also positively associated with urinary levels of pantothenic acid and acetate.",83f51cf7-18bf-4962-84c9-b1ae67134f0a
40,discussion8," Both compounds have a central role in human biochemistry and the metabolism and synthesis of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5, necessary to form coenzyme-A) is present in many foods, and we have previously reported a positive association between consumption of dairy products and urinary pantothenic acid in the same study population . Further, we have previously shown that body mass index (BMI) is negatively associated with urinary levels of this metabolite  and our results suggest that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet associates with pantothenic acid independently of the potential influence of body mass index (BMI). Acetate has multiple dietary sources, it is produced by acetate-producing bacteria in foodstuff and urinary acetate is also modulated by human gut microbial metabolism.",57b107a3-648e-4ce2-81d8-4f5528a340ad
41,discussion9," In our previous Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) analysis on specific food group intakes, we have shown a positive association between potato consumption and urinary acetate levels .  Moreover, we found that ultra processed food (UPF) intake was negatively associated with two urinary amino acids, valine and tyrosine. Tyrosine is regarded as a conditionally essential amino acid in adults and essential in children. Foods high in dietary tyrosine include dairy, meat, eggs, beans, nuts, grains. Tyrosine is a precursor for neurotransmitters and hormones, increases dopamine availability which in turn could enhance cognitive performance . Valine is an essential branch chain amino acid (branch chain amino acid (BCAA)) critical to energy homeostasis, protein and muscle metabolism (Brosnan and Brosnan, 2006; Nie et al., 2018).",debc6dd8-5a9f-4904-acf1-81a6820045c5
42,discussion10," In many studies, it has been observed that elevated branch chain amino acid (BCAA)s are associated with insulin resistance and diabetes (Lynch and Adams, 2014). Also, in our previous Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) study, Lau et al., 2018 we found that urinary valine was associated with higher children’s body mass index (BMI). However, it remains to be eludicated whether these associations are causal (e.g., via mTOR activation) or consequential (e.g., due to reduced mitochondrial oxidation) in metabolic disease, (Lynch and Adams, 2014) and whether ultra processed food (UPF) intake plays a role in the etiology of the association of branch chain amino acid (BCAA)s with metabolic health.",a18b7b2b-4cba-4db7-83a6-a0f914ef8f9e
43,discussion11,"  Strengths and limitations  The main strengths of the study are the multicentric design which included children from six countries spanning north to south in Europe, the use of standardized data collection and biomarker measurement protocols across cohorts, and the fairly large sample size with biomarker data. Identified panels of urinary metabolites had similar or higher capacity in discriminating children’s diet quality to that of established sociodemographic determinants. We chose 1H NMR spectroscopy for urinary analysis as this is an inherently high reproducible, high throughput technique suitable for the identification and quantification of urine metabolites, which are typically of high concentrations, without complex sample preparation which could potentially introduce analytical biases. Also, urinary 1H NMR spectroscopy has been applied in many other cohort studies and proposed as an objective method for dietary assessment (Garcia-Perez et al.",b9e15796-e035-47a3-b6b6-5748ee49a5fc
44,discussion12,", 2017) potentially facilitating comparative studies in the future. We have used a pooled urine sample collection design which combined the last sample before bedtime with the first morning void sample of the following day, and we have shown in our preliminary work that this sample collection strategy has the advantage of reducing diurnal variations .  Our study has also some limitations. As in any observational study, there is the possibility of unmeasured residual confounding. In our analyses, we took into account a number of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors in childhood (e.g., socioeconomic status, ethnicity) that are associated with both diet quality and glycemic response. We did not have data available on children’s physical activity.",d9d515d1-e135-4d20-bfd4-1355c0b0daeb
45,discussion13," Nevertheless, we adjusted all our models for sedentary behavior (including time spent in front of the screen) which has been shown to associate to physical activity levels, as the time devoted to sedentary screen-time activities might affect availability of time devoted for exercise, or vice versa (Serrano-Sanchez et al., 2011; Pearson et al., 2014; Aira et al., 2021) Further, we did not have data available to control for energy intake. However, in all our models, we included body mass index (BMI) of the children, a measure strongly correlated to energy intake,  and assessed ultra processed food (UPF) intake as proportion of total food intake. Moreover, the absence of heterogeneity across cohorts with different correlation structures and confounding patterns in their data , provide evidence to support that unmeasured confounding is unlikely to have influenced the observed associations.",ac8bcee3-8ec7-4fe2-bb67-f4e947d95324
46,discussion14," Since the data collected are cross-sectional, and there is no temporality in the observed associations, further longitudinal studies examining metabolic and glycemic alterations in relation to diet quality are needed. Although 1H NMR spectroscopy had the advantage of improving the specificity of the quantitation and provided explicit metabolite identification, it limited the number of metabolites being measured and provided partial coverage of the urine metabolome. Absolute quantification of some metabolites with exchangable protons such as urea could also be negatively impacted by the solvent suppression methods required for 1H NMR spectroscopy of urine. Supplementing the current study with other complementary untargeted and targeted metabolomic approaches in future, such as mass spectrometry, would help enhance identification and robust quantification of urinary metabolites associated with diet quality in children.",f2aa1ec0-3816-40f1-82b5-0af66280cc5b
47,discussion15,"  In summary, this multicenter European study showed that urinary metabolic profiles related to food constituents (or their metabolic products), to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism reflect adherence to the Mediterranean diet and ultra processed food (UPF) intake in childhood. Higher adherence to Mediterranean diet, lower ultra processed food (UPF) intake, and lower levels of the diet-related carbohydrate sucrose were associated with lower C-peptide levels, a marker of β-cell function. These results provide evidence to support efforts by public health authorities to recommend increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet and limiting ultra processed food (UPF) consumption in childhood. Further prospective studies examining the association of diet quality and related metabolomic profiles with C-peptide and other surrogates of insulin resistance are needed to replicate our findings.
