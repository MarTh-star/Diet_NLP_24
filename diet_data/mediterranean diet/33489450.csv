0,methods0," We searched PUBMED and Google Scholar databases to identify pre-clinical and clinical studies on synthesis and biological effects of indole 3 propionic acid (IPA). The key words included microbiota, tryptophan, indoles, indole-3-propionic acid. The search was confined to manuscripts that were published from 1961 to December 2021. Specific steps of the review process and the evaluation of scientific papers are present in Figure 3. A total of 131 records on indole 3 propionic acid (IPA) were obtained from databases, and an additional 10 papers were included from other sources. A total of 141 papers were screened for relevance and 67 records were excluded from further analysis.",206472b8-c6fb-418c-9ba1-d7df9793fa62
1,methods1," Exclusion criteria were language other than English (2 records), chemistry-focused papers (21 records), papers evaluating results from experiments on subjects other than mammals and bacteria (24 records), and papers on indoles other than indole 3 propionic acid (IPA) and not evaluating effects of indole 3 propionic acid (IPA) (20 records). Finally, 74 papers evaluating the synthesis and biological effects of indole 3 propionic acid (IPA) were included in this review.  8. Conclusions  Symbiotic gut microbiota is able to produce biologically active metabolites that can affect functions of the host. indole 3 propionic acid (IPA) belongs to the wide group of indoles, microbiota derived metabolites of tryptophan. It has been observed that indole 3 propionic acid (IPA) has beneficial impact on host health by possessing anti-inflammatory and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging activity.",bf704023-3896-4fa1-bab5-5d6baa30c561
2,methods2," Further research projects should evaluate its possible clinical applications in the treatment of autoimmune, inflammatory and oncological diseases. Additionally, its synthesis decreases in many pathological states associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, making it a promising new pharmacotherapeutic target.
