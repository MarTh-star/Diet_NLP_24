Subjects and Study Design  The PREDIMED study is a parallel-group, single-blind, multicenter, randomized, controlled 5-year clinical trial aimed to assess the effects of a MD-extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or MD-Nuts on the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases compared with a control low fat diet (LFD) (www.predimed.es, accessed on 26 April 2021) [21,22]. This sub-study used data collected from 285 consecutive participants from two centers (Hospital Clinic of Barcelona and University of Valencia) in whom we determined inflammatory marker concentrations (n = 285) related to different stages of atherosclerosis at baseline and after 3 years of intervention.",bb869454-fa7d-4fda-9073-618b22b88f9d
1,methods1," The gene expression analysis was carried out in a pilot study with a subpopulation of 35 participants (12 in MD-VOO intervention group, 12 in MD-Nuts intervention group, and 11 in low fat diet (LFD) group) at baseline and after 3 years of intervention. The Institutional Review Board of the centers approved the study protocol, and all the participants provided the signed informed consent.  2.2. Plasma Inflammatory Biomarkers  At baseline and after 3 years of follow-up, fasting blood was collected. Plasma was obtained after centrifugation of blood and stored at −80 °C until assay.

Statistical Analysis  The statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 18.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Variables were presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean (standard error of the mean (SEM)) or 95% confidence interval (CI), as appropriate. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages. Plasma inflammatory biomarkers had a skewed distribution (Kolmogorov and Levene tests), and were therefore transformed to their natural logarithm for analysis.",df5d35d2-77d2-4b48-83e9-9ea9b1f206d6
6,methods6,"  Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare 3-year changes in the inflammatory biomarkers and gene expression, testing the effects of interaction of two factors: Time as a within-participants factor with 2 levels (baseline and 3 y) and the groups of consumption (2 MD groups and control group) with an adjustment for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, physical activity, and drug use (aspirin and statins). The multiple contrasts were adjusted by a Bonferroni post hoc test. The Pearson’s correlation was used for univariate association among changes in variables. ANCOVA test adjusted for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, physical activity, and drug use (aspirin and statins) was applied to calculate differences between 3 years and baseline values for the cytokines and chemokines.

A high proportion of participants were overweight or obese (>90%), and 81.8% had hypertension, 70.5% had dyslipidemia, and 55.4% were diabetic. The three groups were well balanced regarding demographic characteristics, anthropometric parameters, and cardiovascular risk factors (Table 1).  Three-year changes of anthropometric measures, cardiovascular risk factors, physical activity, and food and nutrient intakes of the participants were shown in Tables S1, S2, and S3, respectively. During the 3 years of diet intervention, body weight and body mass index (BMI) levels of the participants in the MD-extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) diet group significantly decreased (p < 0.05; both), and diastolic blood pressure significantly reduced in the three intervention groups (p < 0.05; all) (Table S1). Plasma glucose concentration fell in the MD-extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group (p = 0.027), while plasma total-cholesterol (p < 0.",b4600cc6-de03-4a51-bce8-dc0228eb5e1e

Compliance and adherence to interventions were determined with the urinary 3-hydroxytyrosol (3-HT) as biomarker of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption and plasma α-linolenic acid as biomarker of nuts consumption (Table S4). Urinary 3-HT and plasma α-linolenic acid concentrations increased significantly in participants in the MD-extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and MD-Nuts consumption, respectively, compared with the control low fat diet (LFD) and the other MD intervention (p < 0.05) indicating good adherence with supplemental foods. Additionally, Tables S2 and S3 shows the consumption of food and nutrients among the study participants.",f76a98f5-6f06-40d0-879b-466565372105
9,methods9," As expected, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nut intakes significantly increased in the corresponding MD groups (p < 0.001; both), as well as the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) after MD-VOO consumption and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), linoleic and α-linolenic acid after MD-Nuts consumption (p < 0.05).  3.2. Changes in Chemokines and Cytokines between Baseline and 3 Years of Intervention  Figure 1 and Figure 2 shows differences between 3 years and baseline and also, between-group differences in several inflammatory biomarkers. The baseline and 3-year values of chemokines and cytokines were shown in Table S5. Participants following a long-term pattern with MDs showed significantly decreased plasma levels of MCP-1 (p < 0.001, both), MIP-1β (p < 0.031, both), ENA78 (p < 0.001, both), IL-1β (p < 0.025, both), IL-6 (p < 0.013, both), IL-8 (p < 0.025, both), IL-12p70 (p = 0.022, MD-nuts), TNF-α (p < 0.022, both), IFN-γ (p < 0.040, both), and hs-CRP (p < 0.",b93c8cf4-4f17-4c06-8585-39734c3c4ab6

The plasma levels of regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) significantly decreased in the three intervention groups (p < 0.037, all). No significant changes were observed for plasma IP-10, I-TAC, and IL-18 levels (Figure 1 and Figure 2).  Compared with the low fat diet (LFD) group, the two MD groups exhibited significantly lower plasma concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α (p < 0.05, all). In addition, the MD-extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group had 4-fold lower levels of ENA78 (p = 0.063) and 6-fold lower levels of MCP-1 (p = 0.067) than the control group and the MD-Nuts group had 5-fold lower IFN-γ levels (p = 0.042) and 7-fold lower MCP-1 levels (p = 0.035) compared with the controls.  3.3.",4d981de5-dc4c-4811-a826-07082fc78c70
11,methods11," Pilot Study of Gene Expression Changes at Baseline and after 3 Years of Intervention  The mRNA expression of all the studied genes did not change significantly after MD and low fat diet (LFD) interventions in this pilot study with 35 participants (Figure 3) (p > 0.05). However, in the adjusted model, the mRNA expression of CXCR2 and CXCR3 showed a slight trend of increase only in the control low fat diet (LFD) (p = 0.09). In addition, in the non-adjusted model, the mRNA expression of TLR6, TLR2, CCR2, CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR2 significantly increased after 3 years only in the control low fat diet (LFD) (p < 0.05) (Figure S2) suggesting new niches of study with higher number of participants.  3.4. Correlation Analysis of Changes in Inflammatory Biomarkers  Correlations among the three intervention groups were calculated to determine the convergence of cytokines/chemokines. It was found that cytokines/chemokines exhibited different patterns of correlation among the study groups.",5bad9c58-0de1-4424-b922-d801981892c4
12,methods12," In the MD groups, the four significant chemokines were significantly inter-correlated, but this correlation was not observed between ENA78 and both MCP-1 and MIP-1β in the low fat diet (LFD) group (Table 2). Along the same line, when we correlated changes in chemokine and cytokine concentrations (Table 3), the control low fat diet (LFD) group showed a different behavior compared with the MD groups. Thus, higher and significant correlations were observed between changes in regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) and both changes in IFN-γ and IL-6 (p < 0.05; both) and between changes in ENA78 and changes in TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 (p < 0.05; all) in both MD groups. Nevertheless, these correlations were not statistically significant in the low fat diet (LFD) group (p > 0.05). Correlations between cytokines showed the same behavior in the three groups (Table S6).  4.",3700cc4c-274a-48c4-9186-02d12d45646b
13,methods13," Discussion  After 3 years of intervention, both MD groups showed significant anti-inflammatory effects demonstrated by the diminution of plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations (MCP-1, MIP-1β, regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES), ENA78, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and hs-CRP) related to atherosclerosis, together with improvement in classical cardiovascular risk factors (body weight, blood pressure, plasma cholesterol concentration or lipid profile). On the other hand, the low fat diet (LFD) control group showed significant changes of plasma MCP-1, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-γ concentrations compared with both MD groups. Considering gene expression, no significant changes were observed between MD interventions and low fat diet (LFD) control. However, the low fat diet (LFD) control group showed a tendency to increase expression of CXCR2 and CXCR3 genes after 3 years, while this trend was not observed after MD interventions.",1bc3600c-a2f0-4ccb-a353-7c5f4424c212
14,methods14," This is the first work studying the gene expression related to inflammatory stages of atherosclerosis considering such long dietary treatments. Previous works demonstrated beneficial effects of MD on gene expression related to inflammation when administering diets during lower time periods such as several weeks [24,25].  One of the early stages of atherosclerosis is the deposition and oxidation of low density lipoprotein particles (LDL) particles in the arterial intima. This results in the recruitment of monocytes, which differentiate to macrophages upregulating the expression of TLRs, leading to activation of NF-κβ and expression of chemokines with pro-atherogenic effects [26] (Supplementary Figure S1).",5aa23404-73c1-4045-a404-98bc1d9f0882
15,methods15," Increased TLR activity combined with the uptake or intracellular formation of cholesterol crystals, the effects of neutrophil extracellular traps, flow dynamic properties such as an atheroprone flow or intraplaque hypoxia may lead to Nod like receptor protein (NLRP)3 inflammasome activation [27,28]. Through the caspase-1 system, it generated active IL-1β and IL-18 from pro-IL-1β or pro-IL-18, which then consecutively leads to a stimulation of the acute phase reaction [28,29]. In our study, the three molecules (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-1β) involved in the response of NF-κβ showed a similar behavior after 3 years of intervention with MD, compared with the LDF group, while no differences were found in either IL-12 or IL-18 after any of the interventions. Therefore, our study showed that only the IL-1β and not the IL-18 pathway may be affected by long-term interventions with MD.",3a9d5262-e8fd-4fce-b18c-9076c03d121f
16,methods16,"  Previous in vivo studies have observed low concentrations of plasma biomarkers (IL-1β, IFN-γ or TNF-α) after short-term interventions with MD patterns compared to a saturated fatty acids (SFA) diet [18,20]. Contrary to our results, Casas et al. [30] and Esposito et al. [31] showed a decrease in IL-18 concentrations after 1 and 2 years of intervention with MD, respectively.  The results of our study show that MD decreases MCP-1 concentrations after 3 years, whereas those subjects in the control group did not show changes in plasma MCP-1 concentrations. Similar findings have been observed after a short-term intervention with MD in humans [20]. Liu et al. [32] reported that the critical role of TLR2 in the progression of atherosclerosis seems to be associated with MCP-1 levels and macrophage recruitment to atherosclerotic lesions.",99ea75fd-de9e-4602-af19-38f73390c6e8
17,methods17,"  regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) is among the most highly expressed chemokine at transcript and protein levels in platelets and is associated with high risk of coronary artery diseases [33]. Our results showed that plasma concentrations of regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) decreased in both MDs and low fat diet (LFD) groups, a fact that can be due to regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) high affinity binding and signaling with different chemokine receptors including CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5 [34]. Other intervention studies with diets rich in saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) have shown similar results with decreases in regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) expression with these two diets [35].",90e60f08-ac5f-4105-b851-b81227cf0109
18,methods18,"  The two inflammatory receptors CXCR2 and CXCR3 have also been widely involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [36]. Some studies have pointed out that CXCR2 might be involved in the recruitment of neutrophils to the vessel wall during the initiation of atherosclerotic plaque, being the main receptor of IL-8, while CXCR3 and its ligands IP-10 and I-TAC may promote atherogenesis by regulating the recruitment and balance of effector T cells and Tregs [37]. Our results showed a tendency of increase in both CXCR2 and CXCR3 in the low fat diet (LFD) group, but without statistically significant 3-year changes in plasma I-TAC, IP-10, and IL-8 concentrations although concentrations of IL-8 were significantly different between the low fat diet (LFD) group and both MD intervention groups.",d5c0da11-1967-49ee-a729-44999f9986c3
19,methods19," Nevertheless, MD appears to have an immunomodulatory effect on the expression of pro-inflammatory genes along the IL-8 pathway due to the significantly low concentrations observed for this molecule compared with the low fat diet (LFD) group. Previous in vitro studies have shown that microbial metabolites of nuts consumption (urolithins) could decrease IL-8 production in human aortic endothelial cells stimulated with TNF-α [38]. In the same line, phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) have also been related to downregulation of pro-inflammatory factors as IL-8 and IL-6 in human primary osteoarthritis chondrocytes induced by LPS [39].  The review of Barbaresko et al. [18] and the MOLI-SANI study [40] showed evidences to support the hypothesis that Western-like or meat-based patterns are positively associated with low-grade inflammation, while vegetable- and fruit-based patterns such as MD, appeared to be inversely related to inflammatory biomarkers.",2fe0c529-7758-4875-b46c-6b43543e6839
20,methods20," In the present study, we observed a significant diminution of inflammatory markers (MCP-1, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES), ENA78, and hs-CRP) after a long-term intervention with a MD. These data are in line with previously published results by our group at short-term (3 and 12 months) [30,41], in which the MD seemed to exert an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effect through a diminution of pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-1, IL-6), CRP, TNF-α, MCP-1, and soluble endothelial adhesion molecules (sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, sE- and sP-Selectin).  Inflammatory cytokines have potent effects on chemokine production by endothelial cells (EC). Duchene et al. [42] observed elevated ENA78 and CXCL6 mRNA expression in response to IL-1β, while Rouselle et al. [43] reported that among all the cytokines, only IL-6 was positively and highly correlated with ENA78 expression (r = 0.76).",306ac767-949a-4786-a1f2-7e5f5ade6eb6
21,methods21," These results are in accordance with our study since after the MD interventions ENA78 was significantly correlated with IL-6 and IL-1β (p < 0.05) and regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) with IL-6 and IFN-γ (p < 0.05; both), while in the low fat diet (LFD) group we do not observe significant correlations, suggesting that these diets have different behaviors in the inflammation process. Additionally, in studies with human ECs, the combined treatment of oxidized low density lipoprotein particles (LDL) or IL-1β leads to an increase in ENA78 [44] expression, while IL-1β and IL-18, but not oxlow density lipoprotein particles (LDL), stimulate chemokine expression as MIP-1β [45]. The correlation between IL-1β and MIP-1β was only observed after MD interventions (Table 3).",1b78d490-726c-4d22-8c9d-864cf075a66a
22,methods22," On the other hand, we also found a positive correlation between ENA78 and different chemokines with both MDs (Table 2) which were not observed in the low fat diet (LFD) group for MCP-1 and MIP-1β. Previous studies by Balamayooran et al. [44] supported the direct and indirect role of ENA78 in monocyte recruitment after finding MCP-1 concentrations and macrophage numbers to be significantly reduced in the lungs of ENA78−/− mice. In this respect, neutrophils (secreted by ENA78) transmigrated from the intravascular space into inflammatory tissues throughout the basement membrane and then secrete MIP-1β [46]. All the present data suggest that MD counteracts inflammatory processes related to atherosclerosis in a global and coordinated way.",e7dfbd41-b2d9-4207-9dbd-de77161e7bea
23,methods23,"  The strengths of this study are the design as a randomized controlled clinical trial, the high completion rates, the good compliance determined by objective biomarkers, and the high number of inflammatory biomarkers and genes studied, which are involved in different phases of atheroma plaque formation. The study has several limitations. First, the low number of participants in whom we could measure the gene expression. Second, participants in the low fat diet (LFD) group, despite receiving a personalized intervention, barely changed their dietary habits. Third, fatty acids in plasma do not reflect the long-term intake as accurately as adipose tissue or red blood cells do [47].  5. Conclusions  MD seems to reduce inflammatory processes at different molecular levels and avoid changes in gene expression related to atherosclerosis, exerting an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effect upon the different pathways involved in inflammation.",f63de42f-1ec7-4ecb-b663-1cf1113e57a8
24,methods24," Thus, MD achieves a long-term anti-inflammatory effect through the diminution of plasma TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-1β, which are molecules involved in the response of NF-κβ, and also reduces inflammation via IL-1β, rather than IL-18. In addition, MD may act at a molecular level through CXCR2 affecting IL-8 plasma levels rather than acting via CXCR3 due to no changes for I-TAC and IP-10. Further studies should confirm this hypothesis derived of our results.  The results of the present study support the implementation of MD as a healthy long-term dietary pattern in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in populations at high cardiovascular risk.
