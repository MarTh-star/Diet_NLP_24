The MH clinical trial has been structured as a randomized, rater-blind study, carried out on 6 weeks of dietary intervention.  Inclusion criteria were the following: a headache neurologist certification of MH; diagnosis of MH with clinical history > 6 months and with symptoms duration > 4 weeks; Caucasian males and females, aged 18–65 years old; Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) ranged between 18.5 and 25 kg/m2; Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) therapies; willingness to comply with study procedures, including maintaining an online daily headache diary. Exclusion criteria were: any comorbidities, drug or alcohol abuse, psychiatric pathologies, pregnancy and breastfeeding.",03960428-40f6-4ce0-aabb-c6f5cb6ccbc8
1,methods1,"  According to these criteria, the subjects eligible for the study underwent an online assisted medical examination at baseline and the end of dietary intervention due to restrictions during the COVID-19 lockdown. Participants recorded headaches and drug use in an online daily headache diary. Patients were asked to undergo clinical testing at an accredited clinical laboratory.  During the first visit, the enrolled patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to one of two dietary interventions (A and B). A modified rater-blind study was used with only the dietitian unmasked at randomization, able to assign diet plans. All staff involved in the clinical trial was masked for group assignment. Participants did not know the nature of the other intervention.  An evaluation of nutritional status was conducted at baseline and after 6 weeks (t1) through accurate data collection (22).",4dec6d2c-0f67-4708-9923-e5c64573bf15
2,methods2,"  At randomization, to increase diet adherence intensive dietitian counseling, a meal plan, a list of foods and food quantities to buy weekly, and 20 recipes were provided. Patients were monitored during the 6 weeks by telephone interview, performed once a week. They were asked about their general opinion on their satisfaction with the diet. To evaluate the food intake, a Dietary intake assessment (24-h recall) was performed on three non-consecutive days during the baseline phase and repeated during the weeks of the intervention phase. Adverse events were assessed. Participants were asked about the rash, tissue swelling, shortness of breath, swollen tongue, fatigue, and weight change.  The study was conducted following national and international regulations and the Declaration of Helsinki (2000).

Anthropometrics, resting energy expenditure, laboratory tests, inflammatory risk indexes, and drug history  Body weight and height were measured using a scale and a stadiometer at home while the subject was standing wearing underwear. The data were collected to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm, respectively. Neck, waist, and hip circumferences were measured with a flexible and non-extensible metric tape. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as body weight (kg)/height (m2) and classified according to the WHO. A Waist to Hip circumferences Ratio (Waist to Hip circumferences Ratio (WHR)) was evaluated according to the clinical risk thresholds equivalent to Waist to Hip circumferences Ratio (WHR) > 0.85 for women and Waist to Hip circumferences Ratio (WHR) > 0.90 for men (22).",67236207-62fa-48b0-a687-41e2876e2d62
4,methods4,"  The Resting Energy Expenditure (Resting Energy Expenditure (REE)) was determined using the Harris-Benedict formula (23). The Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) was calculated by multiplying Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) by the proper Physical Activity Level (Physical Activity Level (PAL)) (20).  The serological values examined were: Complete Blood Count (Complete Blood Count (CBC)), total Cholesterol (T-Chol), Low-Density Lipoproteins (Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL)), High-Density Lipoprotein (High Density Lipoprotein (HDL)), and Triglyceride (Tg).  Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (Platelet to Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR)) and Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)) were used as inflammation markers. Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) values indicative of low risk are < 1.6, for medium risk, ranged between 1.6 and 2.4, and for high risk is > 2.4 (24). The cut off for Platelet to Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) is < 150 (25).",f53dac7d-556b-4bcc-8503-e3965c66897a

20,discussion0," A balanced and healthy diet that contains an optimal ω-6/ω ratio can be helpful for migraine prevention. The dietary source of ω-3 FAs includes oily fish, such as mackerel, herrings, sardines, salmon, tuna, trout, sea brass, sea bream, linseed oils, nuts, legumes, and leafy vegetables (32). Instead, ω-6 FAs are provided by olive oil, safflower and sunflower oils, corn oil, and peanut oil (13). Regarding the molecular mechanisms, ω-3 FAs exert an inhibitory effect on activating both innate and adaptive immune systems. Furthermore, they show anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties able to remove the Reactive Oxygen Species (Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)) directly. In particular, Eicosapentaenoic Acid (Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA)) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA)) are enzymatically converted to Specialized pro-resolving Mediators (SPMs) known as resolvins, protectins, and maresins, and their functions can orchestrate the resolution of inflammation.",2a9b1069-67b0-4a79-843f-8c13a78903bf
21,discussion1," These molecules can manage the balance of the intracellular redox status, supporting the immune system and mitigating the adverse effects of inflammation (33). Several families of oxylipin receptors are present in the trigeminal nerve endings and central pain processing pathways and regulate the sensitization and release of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP)). This implies a direct link between ω-6 and ω-3 FAs and headache pathogenesis. Since the human body cannot synthesize them, the only way to take them is through the diet (18, 34).  According to the recent scientific evidence, our study hypothesized that an Modified Mediterranean Diet (MMD), with an optimal ω-6/ω-3 ratio, would modify the inflammatory status, consequently reducing the frequency and the intensity of the headache (18, 35).  Recently, Fila et al. have provided an exciting correlation between several micronutrients and oxidative stress in migraine.",469d27fd-0081-4a85-9e1f-1ef6109cdd21
22,discussion2," In this way, Modified Mediterranean Diet (MMD) could be the best dietary pattern for the high amount of ω-3 FAs (9, 36). Modified Mediterranean Diet (MMD) could interact with this inflammation pathway, blocking Nuclear Factor Kappa-Light-Chain-Enhancer of Activated B cells (NF-kB) related gene expression and the inflammation-based headache (18).  According to the American Headache Society, which assessed the evidence of migraine pharmacotherapies, antiemetic therapy (e.g., metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) alone can be used to relieve mild or moderate migraine attacks, although NSAIDs or acetaminophen are usually the drugs of choice to treat mild to moderate migraine attacks (37). If these drugs are ineffective, generally triptans or dihydroergotamine are considered. If the mild attacks get worse or if the attacks are severe from the beginning, triptans or dihydroergotamine can be used (37).",c8ae2d0c-a9e2-4689-a11d-2f7d659b1c77
23,discussion3," When nausea is prominent, the combination of a triptan with an antiemetic at the onset of attacks is effective. Triptans are selective agonists of serotonin (5-HT) 1B and 1D receptors. They are not analgesics themselves, however they specifically block the release of neuropeptides that trigger migraine pain. Triptans are most effective when taken early in the attack. However, excessive use of these drugs can also lead to drug-abuse headaches (37). Furthermore, triptans and dihydroergotamine can cause coronary artery constriction and are therefore contraindicated in patients with coronary artery disease or uncontrolled hypertension; these drugs should be used with caution in elderly patients and in those with vascular risk factors (38, 39).",86cfe904-9c30-4b79-8c86-3f3f27536b82
24,discussion4," Ubrogepant and rimegepant, namely also gepants, which are antagonists of the small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP)) receptor, are sound alternatives without any cardiovascular and gastrointestinal effect. Nevertheless, the anti-Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) antibodies administration is not very frequent, probably due to the high cost-effectiveness (40). Finally, lasmiditan, a novel selective 5-HT 1F receptor agonist or gepant, such as ubrogepant or rimegepant, can be used when triptans or dihydroergotamine are contraindicated due to cardiovascular disorders, because, for its higher affinity for 5-HT 1F than for 1B receptors, has no cardiovascular contraindications.  NSAIDs inhibit the conversion of ω-6 arachidonic acid into the proinflammatory class of series two prostaglandins. An optimal ω-6/ω-3 ratio could mimic this mechanism, with a consequent lower need for symptomatic treatment of MH (41).",8b230310-beb0-48c8-b77c-1a1ea80457aa
25,discussion5," According to this data, a relationship between ω-3 and the inhibition of COX-2 and NF-kB intracellular signaling pathway as the main key actors involved in the inflammation-related MH (Figure 2) has been postulated.  Figure 2 Possible signaling pathway for the connection between ω-3 and inflammation status in the morning headache development and symptoms.  In the present study, a significant decrease in the inflammatory biomarkers Platelet to Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), as shown Table 3, has been observed. Therefore, the pharmacological treatment reduction could be correlated with a lower inflammatory response resulting from the proposed dietary treatment.  Several studies have shown the effect of low-fat diets in migraine prophylaxis (42). It is well known that reducing dietary fat intake for 3 months leads to a reduction in headache intensity, frequency, and drug consumption.",62f8c973-8cf9-4c60-932b-769efabb1074
26,discussion6," Interestingly, these results are achieved only and exclusively with an adequate dietary intake of ω-6/ω-3 ratio (43). In fact, according to our results, individuals who follow a diet rich in ω-3 and low in ω-6 experience a greater improvement in headaches than migraineurs on a low ω-6 diet. These improvements seem to be related to the tuning of the inflammatory mediators, to the lower vasodilation, which is mostly induced by ω-6 and finally to the maintenance of physiological levels of coagulation and serotonin release by platelets, all phenomena promoted by high-fat diet, in particular by ω-6/ω-3 ratio imbalance in favor of the formers (43). Despite the shortness of the intervention and the small sample, results were encouraging. After 6 weeks of Modified Mediterranean Diet (MMD), both HIT-6 score and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores had a statistically significant improvement in the group A, which followed the Modified Mediterranean Diet (MMD) with a 1.7 ± [1.5–1.",23b1be91-cc77-43f5-ae2a-258c2cf894d9

Indeed, all group A patients progressively dismissed the ketoprofen-based pharmacological treatment during the dietary treatment (44).  For the first time, evidence of a correlation between inflammatory status and morning headache development was provided. The inflammation indexes (i.e., Platelet to Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)), often altered in an unbalanced diet, were significantly modified after 6 weeks of treatment with Modified Mediterranean Diet (MMD)s between the two groups.

(45), a positive correlation between ω-3 and weight/circumference loss was confirmed. This is also associated with the decrease in HIT-6 score and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for morning headache from baseline to t1 in group A.  The association between a decrease in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and waist and abdomen circumferences in group A and the possible prediction for increased headache intensity with a higher waist circumference was demonstrated. Starting with these considerations, the importance of Modified Mediterranean Diet (MMD) and nutritional status (e.g., body weight, circumferences, Body Mass Index (BMI), dietary habits) in the morning headache prevention (9) has been highlighted.",cb912393-5e50-4fef-ac21-81d195021256
29,discussion9," Despite the normal-ranged starting Body Mass Index (BMI) of patients, an association between the waist circumference loss during dietary treatment and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) reduction in a generalized linear model has been observed. A strength of our study is the feasibility of Modified Mediterranean Diet (MMD) with respect to other diet therapies, such as elimination diets or severe restrictions (e.g., KD therapy) (10, 11). Our diet therapy plan, unlike the latter, does not prescribe substantial restrictions and deprivation of certain foods and its advantage is a varied and balanced diet consisting of a valid aid in the treatment of headaches. Another peculiarity of our study is the long-term sustainability of the proposed Modified Mediterranean Diet (MMD), despite the other dietary assessments for migraine management.

The main limitation of the present study is represented by an evident difficulty in conducting medical examinations and diet interventions due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Furthermore, the small sample and the lack of inflammation markers (e.g., NF-kB, IL-6, TNF-α, C Reactive Protein – CRP) at the baseline and follow-up do not allow us to better evaluate pro-inflammatory indices, except for Platelet to Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR).
