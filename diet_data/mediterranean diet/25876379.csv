0,introduction0,"Sepsis is a medical condition caused by severe infection that involves systemic inflammation [1] and metabolic changes [2], resulting in multiple organ failure (multiple organ failure (MOF)) and high morbidity and mortality [3].  Metabolic dysfunctions during sepsis include alterations in lipid metabolism and decreased fatty acid oxidation [4]. Consequently, plasma free fatty acids increase, resulting in increased tissue lipolysis in organs such as the liver, kidney, heart and skeletal muscle. This results in harmful consequences for patients with diverse pathological conditions [2, 4–7].  Under physiological conditions, approximately 0.1 to 2 mol of fatty acids are in complex with albumin [8]. As albumin is synthesized in the liver, patients with liver dysfunction, such as cirrhosis and sepsis, have lower levels of albumin, which favors increased serum free fatty acid [9].",60ba9f2b-04a3-49e3-9ac3-bc66bad4c180
1,introduction1," The non-esterified fatty acids (non esterified fatty acids (NEFA)) bind to fatty acid-binding protein (fatty acid binding protein (FABP)) and acyl-CoA (acyl-CoA-binding protein), transporting them to either the mitochondria and peroxisomes, where they are oxidized, or to the nucleus, where they activate gene transcription [10]. These processes are tightly enzymatically controlled. The entry of fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix is regulated by the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I [11], a rate-limiting step of fatty acid β-oxidation. The enzyme uncoupling protein-2 (uncoupling protein (UCP)2) is also associated with increased fatty acid oxidation [12] and non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) reduction [13]. The 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) plays a crucial role in energy homeostasis by increasing catabolic pathways, including β-oxidation, or blocking anabolic processes, such as fatty acid synthesis [14].",199d04ed-d686-4cc7-b5d7-0c52625055d9
2,introduction2," Decreased hepatic expression of fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes occurs during sepsis and endotoxemia [15] and could account for the increased plasma non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations in septic patients.  Polyunsaturated fatty acids (Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) modulate immune system functions. For example, n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) decreases the severity of inflammatory disorders [16], but less attention has been paid to the effects of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) on the immune system [17]. Olive oil is the primary source of fat in the Mediterranean diet and has oleic acid (OA) [18] as the primary component (a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) of the omega-9 family). The Mediterranean diet reduces cardiovascular disease, the incidence of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease and cancer [19]. This diet also results in downregulation of circulating inflammatory biomarkers [20] and oxidative stress.",d103cac2-20e5-44be-8904-0f2b933a3038
3,introduction3," Rats treated with extra virgin olive oil had reduced levels of malondialdehyde induced by herbicide exposure and showed reduced hepatic oxidative stress [21]. Previous reports have indicated that monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) might represent a useful tool in the design of dietary regimens for obesity, cardiovascular diseases [22] and type 2 diabetes [23]. Considering the beneficial effects of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), we aimed to study the effect of OA on lipid metabolism during sepsis. Here, we evaluated the plasma non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels and expression of liver enzymes directly involved in fatty acid oxidation as well as the impact of these modifications on sepsis outcome.

4,methods0,"Animals We used male Swiss-Webster (SW) mice (25 to 30 g) from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation breeding unit, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The animals were kept at 22°C with a 12 hour light/dark cycle and free access to food and water. The animals were weighed on days 1, 7 and 14, and the food intake was estimated per body weight for each cage.  Animals used in our experiments were sacrificed for liver removal and were euthanized due to sepsis complications, such as shock and multiple organ failure. We determined whether daily pretreatment with OA for 14 days would be protective against sepsis complications and improve the survival of septic animals. We used humane endpoints in the experiments, using a lethal anesthesia before the animals were moribund to analyze molecular parameters 24 hours after sepsis induction. We euthanized animals prior to the end of our experiment with a lethal dose of ketamine and xylazine, following the guidelines of our Institutional Animal Ethics Committee.",a6b1dfae-f6dc-49fd-8acf-e112fee26d99
5,methods1,"  We described the animal deaths without euthanasia in the study protocol submitted to our Institutional Animal Ethics Committee. Our ethics committee specifically reviewed and approved the mortality aspects of the protocol. It was a specific aim of the study to analyze whether oleic acid would modulate lipid metabolism and have protective effects against organ failure and shock, improving survival during experimental sepsis. We could not use pain relievers because it has already been shown that pain relievers can also modulate lipid metabolism, and they may have protective effects, potentially biasing results. Pain relievers, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inhibit the production of the lipid mediator thromboxane B2, for example, which causes platelet aggregation and leads to the synthesis of lipoxin A4, accelerating resolution and affecting the sepsis and endotoxemia outcome [24–26].",e5d616d5-2744-40d9-8923-01a6f2c9349a
6,methods2," Thirteen animals died in the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) group, and 8 animals died in the oleic acid-treated septic group. Surviving animals were healthy and behaved normally. We monitored the health of the animals three times a day. We avoided any animal suffering and distress using anesthesia with ketamine and xylazine during surgical procedures, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.  This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Animal Welfare Committee of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation.  Ethics statement The Animal Welfare Committee of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation under license number LW-36/10 (CEUA/FIOCRUZ) approved the experiments in these studies. The same institution that provided ethical approval created the guidelines followed by this Committee.

7,methods3," Oleate solution was prepared by addition of water. NaOH was slowly added until the pH reached 12.0. This mixture was sonicated, and after complete oleate solubilization, the pH was carefully adjusted to 7.6 with diluted HCl. Each animal received 0.28 mg of OA (100 μL) per day by gavage. Control mice received 100 μL of saline orally per day.  Cecal ligation and puncture (cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)) Mice orally received OA or saline for 14 days. On the 15th day, polymicrobial sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) performed as described in Araujo et al. (2012) with minor modifications [27]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (100 mg/kg) (Cristália) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) (Syntec). After aseptic procedures with 70% ethanol, an incision was made through the linea alba. The cecum was exposed, ligated with sterile 3–0 silk and perforated twice with an 18 gauge needle.",826a43a9-f5e4-4abc-983b-fb5d574b2335
8,methods4," A small amount of fecal material was extruded through the wounds, and the cecum was gently pushed into the abdomen. The area was sutured with nylon 3–0 (Shalon) in two layers. All mice received volemic reposition of 1 mL of sterile saline subcutaneously. Six hours after surgery, mice received the antibiotic imipenem (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally in the opposite site from the surgery. Sham mice were subjected to the same procedures described above, but the cecum was neither ligated nor punctured.  Clinical score Six and 24 hours after surgery, all mice had their clinical score evaluated. Time points for analysis were chosen based on previous data [27].",b4046eb4-e205-47f9-b28f-591fee0af53f
9,methods5," The score consisted of analyzing the following parameters: presence of piloerection, altered respiration rate, fecal alteration, lacrimation/eyelid changes, contraction of the abdomen, lack of strength when grasping, change in body temperature, alert response (scape after touch), exploration of the environment and compromised locomotor activity. For every parameter present, we gave 1 point, and in the absence of the parameter analyzed, no points were given. Then, the points were computed for each mouse. A score of 0 indicated that the mouse did not present any clinical alteration, a score between 1 and 3 indicated mild sepsis, between 4 and 7 indicated moderate sepsis and between 8 and 10 indicated severe sepsis [27].  Biochemical analysis Mice were fasted for 12 hours with water ad libitum, and blood was then collected by cardiac puncture.

Plasma non-esterified fatty acid (non esterified fatty acids (NEFA)) quantification Plasma concentrations of the predominant non esterified fatty acids (NEFA)—palmitic, oleic, linoleic, palmitoleic, and stearic acids—were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)) as described by Puttman et al. [28]. Methodological details were described in a previous publication [5].  Thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBarsilva71@gmail com (ARS)) TBarsilva71@gmail com (ARS) were measured in whole livers as previously described [29] with minor modifications.

OA treatment reduced plasma non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations in septic animals Plasma non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels frequently increase in pathological conditions [2, 15, 31], and they may have a deleterious role in septic patients [2, 32]. Accordingly, we observed that septic mice had increased levels of total plasma non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) (Fig 4A), including palmitoleic acid (monounsaturated, omega-7), linolenic acid (polyunsaturated, ω-6), palmitic acid (saturated), stearic acid (saturated) and OA (monounsaturated, ω-9), representing approximately 90% of plasma non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) [33] (Fig 4B).",473aaa1d-f4d0-4202-adc6-4047b88a2820
20,results5," In our previous work, we reported that OA decreased non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in healthy mice [34], and this was also found when OA was administered to septic mice (Fig 4A and 4B). Albumin is the main fatty acid transporter in the plasma, and septic patients have been shown to have lower albumin levels [8]. Animals subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) had lower levels of albumin, and OA treatment did not alter the levels of plasma albumin (Fig 4C). As the ratio of non esterified fatty acids (NEFA)/albumin is important for the prognosis of the disease [9], we showed that OA treatment decreased the ratio, which is associated with a favorable prognosis (Fig 4D).  10.1371/journal.pone.0153607.g004Fig 4 Plasma non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations are reduced after oleic acid treatment in septic animals.

26,discussion0,"Despite advances in care of septic patients, incidence and mortality remain high [3, 43]. The lack of treatments that effectively reduce the excessive response of the host to infections is thought to be one of the foremost obstacles to reducing sepsis mortality [44].  Different diets can affect the host immune response [45]. The Mediterranean diet has been associated with increased longevity, improved overall health, and reduced incidence and mortality of cancer and of other chronic diseases. In the Mediterranean diet, the primary source of fat is olive oil, which is mainly composed of OA. An olive oil-enriched diet protected against endotoxic shock in isogenic C57Bl/6J mice [46]. Our results showed that pretreatment with OA prevented the deterioration in clinical status of septic animals and increased the survival rate.",5de98885-bfda-4ee5-94d4-691e2b17bc00
27,discussion1," Consistent with our data, the administration of immunomodulatory diets containing fish oil (rich in omega-3) increased survival and reduced hospitalization time of ICU patients with septic shock or ARDS [47].  Morbidity and death in septic patients are associated with liver and respiratory failure [48, 49]. Indeed, acute renal failure in ICU patients was observed during sepsis [50, 51]. In our work, OA was able to mitigate the severity of the disease, decreasing the clinical score and also preventing renal and hepatic dysfunction. We found increases in different biochemical markers of liver injury, but due to strain specificity, these levels may be lower than those found in other reports. Although we believe they are important markers in the improvement of animal survival, we cannot assume they are the sole cause of the improved survival. Our study has several limitations due to the model of sepsis induction used and its clinical relevance.",d4dd551b-f5fc-4f13-bc2d-1f2cdb2c3eb2
28,discussion2," The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model is one of the most commonly used models to study sepsis due to the similarity to human sepsis. Nevertheless, there are many different ways to perform cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and this causes variability in the sepsis results [52]. These differences include levels of organ injury markers, susceptibility to organ injury, and death, and they can be related to the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) procedure itself due to the use of antibiotics and posology, number of cecal punctures, needle size, or strain, gender and other factors [52, 53]. According to our data, nitro-oleic acid-treated animals challenged with LPS had less severe multiple organ dysfunctions than animals receiving only LPS [54]. OA affects several different biological processes, but its detailed mechanism of action is not completely understood.",c9528707-de32-418d-9297-2e26c95fc415
29,discussion3,"  During sepsis, a decrease in fatty acid oxidation occurs, causing an increase in non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in plasma and a reduction in energy supply to the organs [2, 55]. Furthermore, patients with sepsis and leptospirosis have high levels of non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in the blood [5, 56], which are associated with hypoalbuminemia and liver failure. Thus, the decrease in energy supply to the organs contributes to multiple organ failure and death [2].  We showed that septic animals had a significant increase in non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and that OA treatment reduced non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels. Similarly, in our previous report we showed that a single dose of OA administered intravenously or orally reduced plasma non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in uninfected Swiss mice [34]. Supplementation with long-chain monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) decreased plasma free fatty acids in obese mice [57].",ab916848-8dbe-47a0-b87e-e5c546b262b8
30,discussion4," We then investigated the expression of proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation because increased fatty acid oxidation reduces plasma non esterified fatty acids (NEFA). peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) is a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor family and acts as lipid sensor, interpreting fatty acids signals linking lipid metabolism and inflammation [58, 59]. OA binds to all three peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms [36]. A potent peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α activator derived from tomato juice, 13-oxo-9,11-octadecadienoic acid, decreased plasma and hepatic triglycerides in obese diabetic mice [60]. Furthermore, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) activation is important in preventing LPS-induced acute liver damage by regulating oxidative/nitrosative stress and STAT1 inflammatory signaling pathways [61].",aea31519-25be-43b2-a5ff-2e745aead0a3
31,discussion5,"  Many genes controlled by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α, including CPT1A and fatty acid binding protein (FABP)1, are involved in lipid metabolism in humans and mice; therefore, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α activation has a major impact on gene regulation in hepatocytes [62]. For entry into the mitochondria to undergo oxidation, fatty acids must be processed by CPT1A. Therefore, this enzyme is an important step in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation [11, 63]. It was also reported that LPS-challenged mice showed an increase in non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and a reduction in the expression of CPT1A [2], leading to lipid accumulation in the body [64]. We showed that OA treatment increased CPT1A mRNA expression in the liver.  Fatty acids activate activated protein kinase (AMPK) and increase CPT1A activity, thus increasing lipid oxidation [65].",463f78b2-09c3-481e-846a-5d7bc486d5e7
32,discussion6," activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an essential molecular player in energy homeostasis at both the cellular and whole-body levels [66]. Activated activated protein kinase (AMPK) induces fatty acid uptake and oxidation in muscle cells, blocks fatty acid synthesis in the liver and decreases lipolysis in adipose tissue [66]. non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) induce activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in the liver, increasing the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α. Our data showed that septic animals treated with OA increased the expression of activated protein kinase (AMPK), which could participate in the induction of liver CPT1A mRNA.",350cbb1b-288c-46cb-9173-a5a3bc38218c
33,discussion7," Because CPT1A expression is controlled by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α [67], and OA is a ligand of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α [36] that activates activated protein kinase (AMPK), we suggest that, at least in part, the effect of OA on CPT1A expression involves activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) activation. Consistent with our data, a report showed that obese diabetic mice supplemented with long-chain monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) had increased mRNA expression of CPT1A [57]. We hypothesize that in our model, OA induced an increase in CPT1A, consequently increasing plasma fatty acid oxidation and reducing non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in the plasma.  Increased oxidative stress also occurs during sepsis and results in overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell damage, multiple organ failure and death [38, 68].",e5f9c868-b00a-43d5-ab23-5bb01da737e6
34,discussion8," OA prevented excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during sepsis. Mice receiving an olive oil-rich diet had lower levels of MDA in a model of oxidative stress caused by injection of acetaminophen [69]. Upregulation of uncoupling protein (UCP)2 has been suggested to be a protective mechanism against excessive lipid exposure and the associated increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lending further support to the role of uncoupling protein (UCP)2 as an antioxidative agent [70]. uncoupling protein (UCP) (thermogenin) is located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Its primary function is to translocate protons from the intermembrane space to the matrix of the mitochondria [71]. A pharmacologically induced decrease in plasma non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) was accompanied by increased activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) and uncoupling protein (UCP)2 expression in the liver [72].",89469972-59bd-47f2-9c94-bb5474e0f109
35,discussion9," We showed that OA increased uncoupling protein (UCP)2 protein levels. Thus, the decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by OA may be, at least in part, related to its ability to control uncoupling protein (UCP) expression. Supporting our hypothesis, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α knockout animals had increased MDA production compared to wild-type animals [61]. Additionally, OA increased expression of uncoupling protein (UCP)2 in a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α-dependent pathway in rat hepatocytes, and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α agonist Wy-14643 stimulated uncoupling protein (UCP)2 mRNA levels [73]. uncoupling protein (UCP)2 is associated with increased oxidation of fatty acids [12] and a consequent reduction in non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) production [13].",0ab4a890-4477-4b33-a155-171d4c97d09e
36,discussion10," Hence, we suggest OA enhance uncoupling protein (UCP)2, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and increasing fatty acid oxidation, thus lowering plasma non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) during experimental sepsis [42, 74].  In summary, treatment with OA caused substantial changes in the metabolism of septic mice and showed significant protective effects. Pretreatment with OA prevented both clinical impairment and organ damage and increased the survival rate. Importantly, OA treatment affected neither the animal weight gain nor food intake. OA treatment induced genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and subsequent fatty acid degradation. non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) reduction was followed by an increase in the expression of two essential proteins in the oxidation of fatty acids, CPT1A and uncoupling protein (UCP)2 (Fig 7).",3fd89b5e-d414-4c86-8ef7-60deb59b4683
37,discussion11," Consistent with other studies recommending a high monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) diet in type 2 diabetes [23] and in the composition of dietary regimens for obesity and cardiovascular disease [22], we show that high monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) diets appear to be effective in reducing non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) during infection and should be recommended in dietary regimens to prevent and/or ameliorate infectious diseases.  10.1371/journal.pone.0153607.g007Fig 7 OA alters fatty acid metabolism and organ dysfunction and improves sepsis outcome. CPT1A –carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)–peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, uncoupling protein (UCP)2 –uncoupling protein 2; activated protein kinase (AMPK)—5' AMP-activated protein kinase. OA activates activated protein kinase (AMPK), increases CPT1A and uncoupling protein (UCP)2 and decreases fatty acid synthesis, resulting in an increase in oxidative processes.",42840e11-8757-43a3-a18b-278d9efabd82
38,discussion12," peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) activation leads to an increase in the expression of CPT1A and uncoupling protein (UCP)2; consequently, the fatty acid oxidation will be enhanced. Augmented fatty acid oxidation leads to a decrease in the non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) plasma levels. Decreased non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels would improve organ dysfunction and increase survival rate.
