0,introduction0,"Poor diet quality is a leading and preventable cause of adverse health globally, which includes both maternal and child health (maternal and child health (MCH)) and non-communicable diseases (non communicable disease (NCD)s).1, 2 The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outline global consensus on social, economic, environmental, and health targets to be met by 2030, with most goals concerned with nutrition including one goal to end malnutrition.3 Yet rates of progress toward achieving the SDGs have been slow, and accelerated momentum is needed.4, 5, 6, 7, 8 To develop sound strategies and monitor progress toward these goals, the assessment of global dietary quality is essential.  Although a variety of dietary metrics have been developed and used to summarise various components of a diet (eg, adequacy, quality, diversity),9, 10 there remains an absence of widely used, validated metrics to define the double burden of malnutrition, and to compare effectively across country settings.",ddd36550-b3a9-4ff5-8173-c8d04c3fea71
1,introduction1," This absence at least partly relates to a historical distinction between global nutrition efforts for maternal and child health (MCH) versus non communicable disease (NCD)s.11, 12, 13 Malnutrition for maternal and child health (MCH) has traditionally been considered as insufficient caloric or other nutrient intake leading to insufficient physical growth (stunting), rapid weight loss or failure to gain weight (wasting), cognitive impairment, exacerbation of anaemia and blindness, or weakening of the immune system resulting in increased risk of infectious diseases and mortality.14 Malnutrition for non communicable disease (NCD)s has historically been considered as excess consumption of certain nutrients such as fat, sugar, and salt as well as calories.12, 15 Yet, malnutrition for maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD)s are frequently coexisting consequences of poor diet quality within populations, households, or individuals across the lifespan.",e8d7df2a-ce3d-46ac-b068-6612e15be0c4
2,introduction2,"16, 17 A unified global dietary quality metric (hereafter referred to as dietary metric) would aid in policy and programme decision making around improving diet in which components that contribute to both maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD)s would be represented in the same assessments, and that the relative contributions of malnutrition for maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD)s could be characterised and compared across settings in a standardised way.  The optimal dietary metric for assessing malnutrition for both maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD)s remains uncertain.

4,introduction4," To understand whether any existing dietary metrics are validated against maternal and child health (MCH) or non communicable disease (NCD)s, or both, and what researchers and health organisations are using to measure various aspects of the dietary contribution to maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD)s, we extensively reviewed and assessed the validity of existing multinational dietary metrics for maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD) health outcomes.  Key messages • Many global efforts are focused on tackling the double burden of malnutrition including the UN Sustainable Development Goals. However, these targets might not be achieved without a practical and valid dietary metric to reduce malnutrition across global contexts.",37b7d6a5-45ff-4609-84d7-4c51cd787857
5,introduction5,"  • We identified 19 dietary metrics, including seven developed for maternal and child health (maternal and child health (MCH)), 12 developed for non-communicable diseases (non communicable disease (NCD)s) and none developed or applied for both.  • All maternal and child health (MCH) dietary metrics used foods only, while most non communicable disease (NCD) metrics included foods and nutrients. The most frequent components for both maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD) dietary metrics were vegetables, fruits, grains, roots, and tubers.  • When the validity was assessed, we found that four non communicable disease (NCD) metrics had convincing evidence of protective associations with specific non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes, primarily mortality, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and total cancer. The remaining eight non communicable disease (NCD) dietary metrics and all seven maternal and child health (MCH) dietary metrics did not.",d65fb3c8-533a-4a26-ac2e-c92da8de05ef
6,introduction6,"  • We found that few dietary metrics have been validated against maternal and child health (MCH) or non communicable disease (NCD) health outcomes, and none for both indicates. More work is needed to validate existing and novel dietary metrics for maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD), an approach that is likely critical to the achievement of global nutrition and health targets.      Dietary metric definition and inclusion We defined a dietary metric as a metric derived from nutrients or food or food groups, or both, with the aim of measuring dietary diversity (number of different foods consumed), or nutrient adequacy (achievement of recommended intakes of energy or essential nutrients).",d3db257b-a4c5-47e4-926a-fbd5f4a9c1ce
7,introduction7,"10 We included dietary metrics with the reported intended use of relating diet to maternal and child health (MCH) (micronutrient adequacy, mortality in children <5 years, maternal mortality, underweight, stunting, wasting, infectious diseases, diarrhoeal disease) and non communicable disease (NCD) health outcomes (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes; total cancer and subtypes, and anthropometrics in adults and children), and that quantified the level of intake of foods or nutrients consumed or the achievement of recommended intakes. A detailed description of the health outcomes is shown in the appendix (p 1). We selected the health outcomes in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO)'s categories of malnutrition.31 Given the interest in dietary metrics that can be used globally, we included dietary metrics that were used for this purpose in at least three countries.",6761347f-10c8-4c69-8386-85209660000d
8,introduction8," We did not include dietary metrics that included non-dietary factors as a core component, that only summarised a single nutrient or food, or that were developed with a primary focus on non-health outcomes (eg, sustainability). We did not include dietary metrics derived primarily from statistical data clustering approaches, such as cluster or factor analysis, because these are often not generalisable.32 We also did not include dietary metrics at the population level (eg, food supply) because we were interested in individual-level and household-level dietary metrics.  Literature searches Given the abundance of potential dietary metrics, we did not systematically identify all possible metrics.",7d1dde8a-d0c7-44e2-9e1c-084519c2a364
9,introduction9," First, we compiled a list of dietary metrics through expert contacts, who were faculty members at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science, Tufts University, with expertise in food policy, agriculture, economics, international nutrition programming, humanitarian emergency relief, clinical nutrition, and epidemiology. This initial list was then used to search PubMed and Google to identify studies and development reports from government agencies, health organisations, and non-profit organisations up until Sept 21, 2018, that included these dietary metrics, met our inclusion criteria, and were published in English. These searches were complemented by hand-searching of the citations of all identified articles and reports to identify additional potential dietary metrics. We documented all identified dietary metrics that both did and did not meet the scope of our inclusion criteria (appendix p 5).",579cf97d-ccad-4377-9248-49d438c3b103
10,introduction10,"  To assess validity of each relevant dietary metric, we systematically searched PubMed from Oct 11, 2000, to April 17, 2020, to identify meta-analyses or narrative reviews (including systematic reviews without a meta-analysis, but not umbrella reviews) evaluating these dietary metrics in relation to maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD) health outcomes. The search terms and restrictions are described in full in the appendix (pp 2–4).  Data extraction VM did the literature searches, assessed titles and abstracts of all identified studies and reviewed and extracted relevant data by hand using a standardised electronic spreadsheet. The intended purpose, food and nutrient components, scoring, reference period, validity, and reliability was tabulated on each dietary metric.",5e71b1a2-6ea6-411c-be35-e1a76d16b368
11,introduction11," For each published meta-analysis or narrative review, data were extracted on the number of studies included, pooled relative risks and corresponding uncertainty, sample sizes, number of events, follow-up durations, unit of exposures, and population characteristics. In most cases, the total number of participants was not reported in the original meta-analyses and was computed from summary tables of the individual studies. Because narrative reviews do not provide pooled estimates, the extractions were done for each individual study included in the narrative review. When more than one meta-analysis or narrative review was identified for each dietary metric-health outcome relationship, we included all published meta-analyses or narrative reviews. Questions or uncertainties related to article screening and extraction were resolved by discussion with another investigator (DM).",c96134d8-a8cc-4cea-b034-44dc4f8631e2
12,introduction12,"  Assessment and grading of validity Two investigators (VM and then either PW, RM, or DM), independently and in duplicate, used the most comprehensive (with the greatest number of participants and studies) or recent meta-analysis when available, followed by the most comprehensive (with the greatest number of participants and studies) or recent narrative review to assess and grade the evidence for validity of dietary metrics in relation to maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD) health outcomes. In cases in which the most recent meta-analysis or narrative review was not the most comprehensive, we selected the most comprehensive. Each assessor extracted data on the number of studies and the direction of effects across studies (positive association, null association, negative association).",9c65704f-ca4e-4c1d-b323-ff619407dc45
13,introduction13," If the number of studies with null associations was equal or greater to the number of studies with positive or negative associations, the relationship was classified as no association. For both meta-analyses and narrative reviews, we considered the direction of effects from each included individual study. The validity of each dietary metric was assessed using two criteria: first, the number of studies, and second, the consistency of evidence from meta-analyses and narrative reviews of prospective cohort studies or randomised controlled trials. Consistency was defined as the association is repeatedly observed in different populations and circumstances. For a consistent relationship, at least half of the associations were in the same direction and for an inconsistent relationship, fewer than half of the associations were in the same direction.",eb23a8c4-4da7-46b4-8ec7-1e319cb3f6de
14,introduction14," Three assessment categories were established: consistent evidence for the dietary metric-health outcome relationship (positive, null, negative) from five or more studies; inconsistent evidence for the dietary metric-health outcome relationship from five or more studies; and little evidence from less than five studies. For assessing validity of each dietary metric against foods, nutrients, and other non-dietary metrics (eg, biomarkers, food insecurity indicators) we used the published papers or development reports that described the development process of the dietary metric. All disagreements among reviewing investigators regarding the assessment and grading of validity were resolved through discussion.  Identified dietary metrics In total, we identified 19 dietary metrics used in three or more countries each to assess diet quality in relation to various health outcomes (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3).",d43c6add-7b90-4b56-8b9d-fea8b066773e

To our knowledge, these findings provide the most current and extensive synthesis of specific multinational dietary metrics for risk of maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD)s.",eece6208-bb90-4d65-8783-8c343191ce2e
69,discussion3,"  Among maternal and child health (MCH) dietary metrics, the Infant and Young Child Minimum Dietary Diversity (IYCMDD) is the most widely used and is routinely collected in studies in low-income and middle-income countries, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys142 and UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys,143 as a component of the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Minimum Acceptable Diet for children aged 6–23 months.144, 145, 146 Despite its frequent use, we identified one meta-analysis assessing the association of the Infant and Young Child Minimum Dietary Diversity (IYCMDD) with one maternal and child health (MCH) health outcome, and no meta-analyses or narrative reviews with non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes. We are aware of selected individual studies that have reported beneficial associations of Infant and Young Child Minimum Dietary Diversity (IYCMDD) with child growth outcomes (eg, stunting, wasting, height-for-age Z score, and weight-for-height Z score).",9bc04604-95c1-4788-968d-304667e35644
70,discussion4,"147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155 However, such evidence has not been systematically reviewed nor summarised. The Infant and Young Child Minimum Dietary Diversity (IYCMDD) assesses binary recall of seven broad food groups over the previous 24 hours. Although data collection is quick and undemanding for research staff and participants, the simplicity of the Infant and Young Child Minimum Dietary Diversity (IYCMDD) is also a potential limiting factor in predicting health outcomes. Ironically, the existing widespread use of the Infant and Young Child Minimum Dietary Diversity (IYCMDD) could impede development and validation of new metrics for maternal and child health (MCH) or the double burden of malnutrition, because a substantial proportion of available dietary data in low-income and middle-income countries is restricted to Infant and Young Child Minimum Dietary Diversity (IYCMDD)'s broad food groups.",9423a92a-5c34-4b27-a921-bfafaeb698dd
71,discussion5," Our findings show that much work is needed to validate the Infant and Young Child Minimum Dietary Diversity (IYCMDD) for uses other than its intended purpose of measuring micronutrient adequacy. In the absence of robust validation of the Infant and Young Child Minimum Dietary Diversity (IYCMDD) against health outcomes, studies and organisations should consider more rigorously validated questions on diet quality.  Among the other maternal and child health (MCH) dietary metrics, we identified only two narrative reviews for the Dietary Diversity Score (DDS),100, 118 and four for the Food Variety Score (FVS).118, 123, 131, 141 No meta-analyses or narrative reviews were identified for the remaining maternal and child health (MCH) dietary metrics (Food Consumption Score (FCS), Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDietary Diversity Score (DDS)), MDD-W, and Women's Dietary Diversity Score (WDietary Diversity Score (DDS)) and Individual Dietary Diversity Score (IDietary Diversity Score (DDS))).",40eb4fbd-2a98-49d9-b5b5-4ba6996742cd
72,discussion6," We expect that individual studies will have assessed the relationship between these dietary metrics and maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes, and our findings highlight the need to pool and synthesise available individual studies of these dietary metrics in relation to both maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes in adults and children.  Our investigation also found that although numerous dietary metrics are used to assess the dietary risks of non communicable disease (NCD)s, most do not have convincing evidence of associations that have been summarised in published narrative reviews or meta-analyses. Only four metrics (Mediterranean Diet Score (MED), AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) had generally consistent evidence of associations with specific non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes.",c210a2a5-1b6c-47cb-b83b-06203d1740cd
73,discussion7," For outcomes such as anthropometrics and certain cancer subtypes, further validation is needed. Additionally, none of these four non communicable disease (NCD) dietary metrics have been assessed in meta-analyses or systematic reviews of important maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes.  Previous reviews of dietary metrics have focused solely on describing dietary metric features and dietary metric development,9, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 or the evidence for dietary metrics in relation to a single disease.25, 26 Other reviews looked more broadly at dietary metrics and maternal and child health (MCH)10 or non communicable disease (NCD)s,20, 27, 28, 29, 30 but these are more than a decade old and did not also consider both maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD)s together.",10483be3-eb63-43d6-b4ef-4bef33333f74
74,discussion8," Consistent with our findings, these previous studies generally found that maternal and child health (MCH) dietary metrics were not validated against maternal and child health (MCH) or non communicable disease (NCD) health outcomes, and that only a modest number of non communicable disease (NCD) dietary metrics predicted some chronic diseases. Our findings build upon and greatly extend these previous reviews by providing the most extensive contemporary summary of the evidence for associations of dietary metrics with both maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes.  Future studies should consider analyses to validate existing dietary metrics with both maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes. Additionally, our findings suggest the need for development of novel dietary metrics designed from the start to assess and monitor both maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD)s.",822b7e26-5474-48ee-b482-8660810328cd
75,discussion9," Novel dietary metrics could be entirely new, or adaptations of existing dietary metrics and should be developed with several key considerations. First, comprehensive reviews of existing dietary metrics and health outcome relationships can be used to inform the features of new metrics (eg, foods or nutrients, scoring, cutoffs). We found that the four non communicable disease (NCD) dietary metrics with convincing evidence for associations were comprised of food and nutrient components, included healthy plant foods and dairy, and often included red and processed meat, or sodium. This finding might suggest that these components are important aspects of dietary metrics. However, the validity of most remaining dietary metrics has not been assessed against health outcomes, and it is not known whether dietary metrics without these components are less predictive of validity than those with these components.",71ffd11b-4d1b-4902-90ef-d7fdd4c787ec
76,discussion10," Second, systematic evaluations to summarise the aetiologic effects and optimal levels of dietary factors for maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes might provide hypotheses to inform the selection of foods and nutrients in new dietary metrics. In the past 10 years the growing availability of standardised, global dietary data has provided greater clarity on actual food and nutrient intakes,156, 157 and the relationships between foods and nutrients, and cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes158 and cancer159 are well documented, but similar associations for many maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes have not been systematically assessed. Third, new dietary metrics need to acknowledge and reconcile potentially opposing effects of some foods and nutrients on maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes.",c30fb27e-c140-40cf-8dfe-fb6a0b6eb1e8
77,discussion11," For example, animal source foods (eg, meat, fish, eggs, dairy) have been shown to have beneficial effects on micronutrient deficiencies, child growth outcomes, and cognitive function,148, 160, 161 but some of these foods, such as processed meats, are negatively associated with non communicable disease (NCD)s.158, 159 Although we did not include sustainability metrics in our Review, an important consideration for future dietary metric development is the incorporation of the measurable effect of different food production systems on the environment in dietary metrics. Lastly, an influential consideration for the widespread adoption of existing dietary metrics by health agencies and governments is likely dependent on cultural appropriateness and ease of collecting and scoring these dietary metrics.  Several challenges have likely limited validation of dietary metrics against both maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD).",4baa0361-32ed-4a3b-9f72-fe50243c6f0e
78,discussion12," Ideally, prospective cohort studies with detailed and accurately measured data on both dietary habits and health outcomes should be leveraged. However, populations with maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes often do not have strong dietary assessment methods and longitudinal data. Most studies on maternal and child health (MCH) dietary metrics collect information on dietary intake over the previous 24 hour period because the priority is on identifying trends, comparisons, and rankings of outcomes within and between groups, which is generally of interest in setting and evaluating programme targets, and a longer reference period is not necessarily appropriate for these purposes and might be more difficult to operationalise. Moreover, these studies frequently assess diet qualitatively and the absence of quantitative data limit opportunities to construct and validate existing non communicable disease (NCD) dietary metrics.",50d585f1-f53a-4d6d-8ab8-5a9fb041cbaf
79,discussion13," Ecological analyses are an alternative study design, which bring their own limitations but could address both maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD) across low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries. In addition to these practical data challenges, one of the most important limitations of previous work might have been the general segregation of diet related maternal and child health (MCH) versus non communicable disease (NCD) research and policy.  Our Review has several strengths. We did systematic searches for meta-analyses and narrative reviews of validation against health outcomes, making it less likely that we missed any existing syntheses of dietary metric and health outcome relationships. We included a broad range of health outcomes for maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD)s, informing the modern priorities for the double burden of malnutrition.",66cc1e68-0e0b-4c27-8d3c-a5bbf55c83be
80,discussion14," We evaluated the evidence for health associations independently and in duplicate, including the grading of consistency, reducing the potential for bias.  Limitations should be considered. First, we focused on major maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD) health outcomes, and there might be other relevant health outcomes that were not included, such as cognitive function, bone and joint disorders, and non communicable disease (NCD) risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and glucose control). Second, our systematic reviews for each dietary metric in relation to maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD) health outcomes was limited to published meta-analyses and narrative reviews and did not separately assess individual studies. However, meta-analyses and narrative review are more likely to provide accurate and reliable conclusions compared to single studies, minimising publication bias.",719029a4-b53e-4d85-a32e-1e170a4cdaa2
81,discussion15," Lastly, the evidence for validity came mostly from observational studies and some trials, and these are subject to residual confounding, which could overestimate associations, and measurement error in both diet assessment methods and outcome ascertainment, which might result in an underestimation of the relationships between the dietary metrics and maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD) health outcomes.  In summary, we identified seven international dietary metrics for maternal and child health (MCH), none of which have been validated against health outcomes in meta-analyses or narrative reviews, and 12 dietary metrics for non communicable disease (NCD)s, of which only four have convincing evidence for validation against specific non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes.",ab85cdc6-5d56-40f1-ab2f-cbcef2829266
82,discussion16," These findings highlight important gaps and major opportunities in global analyses of diet quality relating to malnutrition, which are highly relevant to the achievement of the UN SDGs, other global nutrition targets, and corresponding effective policy actions.  Search strategy and selection criteria We searched PubMed for articles published between Oct 11, 2000, and April 17, 2020, using the terms “diet quality”, “diet metric”, or “diet score” with “malnutrition”, “undernutrition”, “maternal health”, “child health”, “stunting”, “wasting”, “mortality”, “non-communicable disease”, “chronic disease”, “cardiovascular disease”, “diabetes”, “cancer”, or “obesity” with “meta-analysis”, “systematic review”, or “narrative review”. We used search terms in English but did not apply any language restrictions. We screened articles by title and abstract to identify full-text reports that were relevant to the study aims.",2559fccc-7924-480a-89be-20f3fcc465fc
83,discussion17," We also screened citation lists for these full-text reports to identify other relevant articles. Articles were considered relevant if they reported the relation between dietary metrics and malnutrition. Several previous reviews qualitatively summarised the evidence for dietary metrics in relation to a single health outcome, and other reviews focused on several maternal and child health (maternal and child health (MCH)) or non-communicable disease (non communicable disease (NCD)) health outcomes. A few comprehensive reviews of dietary metrics in relation to several maternal and child health (MCH) or non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes were completed more than a decade ago, and no review has focused on both maternal and child health (MCH) and non communicable disease (NCD) outcomes.
