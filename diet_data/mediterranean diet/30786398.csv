Study Sites This descriptive, community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted over two months, in June and July 2016, at the National Park of Cilento, Vallo di Diano, and Alburni (Salerno, Italy). Subjects living in the following villages were enrolled: Acciaroli, Casal Velino, Gioi, Futani, Montano Antilia, Pattano, San Mauro Cilento, San Mauro La Bruca, Sessa Cilento, Stella Cilento, and Vallo della Lucania. The study was conducted in the homes of enrolled subjects.  2.2.",50fe7fe8-917b-4dd8-9a49-10e4ea693537
1,methods1," Patients and Methods For this pilot study, we worked in collaboration with local General Practitioners (GPs) who compiled a list of 29 households, each encompassing at least one subject aged ≥90 years and up to two cohabitants aged 50 to 75 years, of either sex, for a total of 78 individuals, of whom 29 were NCs. The selection of the NC and their families was made by Cilento family doctors and was based on a single inclusion criterion—that each household was composed of at least one NC and two cohabitants from 50 to 75 years of which doctors had complete records. All the participants were visited at home by a psychologist, a neuropsychologist, a nutritionist, and a team of cardiologists. The specialists planned their visits to the subjects’ homes so as not to overlap and to have the time necessary for each evaluation.  Blood samples were also collected at home by Central Lab nurses (Lab D’Arena, Vallo della Lucania).",ffdf228e-7f86-48f8-ae68-df4f64d1f3e2
2,methods2," The study received approval from the ethics committee of the ASL Salerno (Comitato Etico Campania Sud), and the Human Subjects Protection Committee of the University of California San Diego. All participants provided written, informed consent to participate in the study.  2.3. Lifestyle Assessment Lifestyle information was obtained using questionnaires administered by trained study personnel and focused particularly on dietary lifestyle, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking habits. The dietary lifestyle was assessed by a nutritionist who evaluated the daily food intake at the participants’ homes. Adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) index, whose score ranges from 0 (no adherence to the Mediterranean Diet) to 9 (maximal adherence) [9].",63cc54af-6b6f-4b6c-bc89-1dc00c8ef250
3,methods3," Nine food groups or nutrients were considered—fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, meat and meat products, milk and dairy products, wine, and extra virgin olive oil. Moreover, a complete visit for clinical judgment from the GP was performed at the same time.  2.4. Neurological and Psychometric Assessments The neuropsychological and functional autonomy tests utilized in our study for the evaluation of the cognitive status of NCs and their cohabitants were Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) (Mini-Mental State Examination) [10,11] in all subjects, while ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale—Cognitive) [12,13,14,15] in cohabitants only.   Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) is the most commonly used test to screen for overall cognitive impairment and represents a rapid and reasonably sensitive tool for the quantification of cognitive abilities and their changes over time. It consists of 11 items divided into five sections that include verbal and non-verbal tests.",e03aced9-821d-432b-be62-9ee2fa96638b
4,methods4," The scores followed the attribution rules according to Spencer and Folstein (1985) [10] and were adjusted for age and education [11].  In the assessment of the cognitive status of cohabitants, the ADAS-Cog [12,13,14,15] was used in addition to the Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE).  The broader ADAS scale is divided into two sections:ADAS-Non-Cog (non-cognitive) is used to describe a subject’s behavior problems;  ADAS-Cog evaluates specific cognitive sufficiency characteristics sensitive to the process of deterioration from primary degenerative dementia.    The ADAS-Cog is particularly useful to determine the extent of cognitive decline and can help assess the degree of severity of dementia based on the person’s responses and scores.",2e589d17-6909-4912-b12e-1034cd9b62fa
5,methods5,"  It includes 11 tests—memory (immediate word recall, orientation, word recognition, remembering test instructions); language (Naming objects and fingers, commands, spoken language ability, Word-finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, Comprehension); praxia (Constructional praxis, Ideational praxis)  The total score on the ADAS-Cog ranges from 0 to 70. The final score is corrected for educational level.  Physical activity was evaluated in NCs only, based on ADL and IADL scales covering daily physical functioning, and more complex aspects of everyday life:  ADL (Activities of Daily Living) [16,17]; and  IADL (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) [18];  In the group of cohabitants, the ADL and IADL scales were not performed because none of the subjects had functional autonomy deficits  The ADL was used to investigate the ability of the subject to carry out daily activities such as dressing, washing, and feeding independently.",1848e680-1f60-4324-aadf-9b460c6c6579
6,methods6," It involves the assignment of a point for each independent function so as to obtain a total performance score that ranges from 0 (complete dependence) to 6 (independence in all functions) [16,17].  The IADL (Instrumental activities of daily living), on the other hand, checks daily instrumental skills such as knowing how to count money. Also, for the calculation of the IADL index, a simplified scale is used, which provides for the assignment of a point for each independent function in order to obtain a total performance score that ranges from 0 (complete dependence) to 8 (independence in all functions) [18].  Finally, a global clinical judgment was also formulated by GPs using the following additional parameters—analysis of associated pathologies and clinical judgment for the presence/absence of dementia according to the guidelines of the Italian Society of Neurology [19].  2.5.",5cae3d23-f77e-4a1c-ae6e-e7737500abd9
7,methods7," Laboratory Blood Testing The total oxidizing capacity of the serum was determined by testing the d-ROM (a reactive derivative of oxygen metabolites), whose chemical principle is based on the ability of a biological sample to oxidize N, N-diethyl para phenylenediamine (DPPD). The total antioxidant capacity of the serum was evaluated by the Biological Antioxidant Potential (BAP) (Biological Antioxidant Potential) test, which measures the ability of a sample serum to reduce iron from ferric to ferrous ionic form [20,21,22,23,24].  These tests were conducted using the Free Radical Elective Evaluator photometers (Diacron, Grosseto, Italy).  The APOE genotype was determined by a PCR-based method (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and subsequent restriction analysis [25].  2.6. Statistical Analysis The main analysis of the data is descriptive in nature.  3. Results We compared 29 NCs and 49 cohabitants aged 50–75 years, from 29 households.",192ad9ce-9372-4d92-bdb8-2d2090806872
8,methods8," The characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1.  3.1. Lifestyle Assessment None of the NCs were regular smokers, compared to nearly one-third of the cohabitants. In contrast, NCs were significantly more likely to consume daily alcohol, with 77% drinking, on average at least one drink per day, compared to 48% of cohabitants. Of the subjects who regularly consumed alcohol, over 20% of the cohabitants had, on average >2 drinks daily, compared to only 5% of the NCs. Alcohol consumption by the NCs was almost exclusively red wine.  With regard to the dietary lifestyle, the mean percent score of the adherence to the Mediterranean diet, evaluated through the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) index, showed no meaningful numerical difference between the NC and cohabitant groups, with 89% and 81% of either satisfactory or high adherence, in NCs and cohabitants, respectively (Figure 1).  3.2.",6a699c8c-d97d-4a83-995e-4fa6a377a3ca
9,methods9," Cognitive and Neurological Assessment The Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) results are shown in Table 2. Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) scores obtained in the NC group had values ≥24 in 16 subjects (55.2%), suggesting good overall cognitive functioning, and a score of ≤20 in 12 subjects (41%). One subject’s score was considered unreliable due to a severe hearing deficit and being illiterate.   It is worth mentioning that the lowest Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) score in NCs was 13. This seems to demonstrate that in such an elderly population, there was no subject with severe cognitive impairment on the Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) scale—i.e., score below 10.   In the final formulation of the diagnostic judgment, the relevance of tests administered and of the various associated pathologies was considered, but a relevant weight was also attributed to the clinical evaluation by the GPs.",db7ee3cf-6638-4a4e-8e1b-315781025f13
10,methods10," Their clinical evaluation allowed determination of the effects of these deficits on the autonomies of the subjects. Based on the careful analysis of this evidence in many of them, dementia was diagnosed in four out of 29 NCs. The results are summarized as follows:  2 (6.6%) subjects were affected by vascular dementia due to associated pathologies (stroke);  1 (3.3%) subject was diagnosed with degenerative dementia;  1 (3.3%) subject was diagnosed with mixed dementia.  The analysis of the data obtained from the ADAS-Cog scores in cohabitants (Table 3) demonstrated a very low score in 13 out of 49 subjects. The only tests of significant diagnostic value were the objective evidence of memory, i.e., the proof of ""re-enactment of words"" (subtest 1) in which 15 subjects had a high score, and the test of ""recognition of words"" (subtest 7) in which eight subjects had a high score.",a8b6fb9d-0924-4d5f-975b-183abd021458
11,methods11," In total, only three subjects presented positive results for both subtests 1 and 7, two females and one male, and a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)) was then made in these three subjects.   3.3. Functional Assessment Data obtained on the ADL scale in the NC group (Table 4) showed that 16/29 of them were able to autonomously carry out daily life activities. The IADL scale analysis (Table 4) showed that 11 out of the 26 examined subjects were able to perform independent daily instrumental activities, while six were only partially able to perform them. There were no meaningful numerical differences in the scores between males and females.  The results from the analysis of the various scale data showed that in the 16 subjects with Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) values ≥24, there were five subjects in whom the scores on ADL and IADL were low.",b01c9910-bad3-46cb-978f-ca7d542787f8
12,methods12," For these subjects, the causes of lack of autonomy in the activities of daily life were due to problems of physical origin such as a bone fracture or serious impairment of the vision, as recorded in the initial clinical evaluation.  On the other hand, it was possible to obtain good scores on the ADL and IADL scales in NC subjects in whom the scores on the Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) were rather low. This may be explained by the fact that the Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) is an instrument that has limits, as noted above.   3.4. Laboratory Tests  The results of the comparative analysis of the individual data obtained in the NCs with dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are summarized in Table 5 and Table 6.",43b9c357-ed4f-4ea8-9a57-65296160ff84
13,methods13," Looking at the three subjects in the cohabitant group with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and the relative NCs, the Biological Antioxidant Potential (BAP) values were lower than the normal value, and in all of the subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the values of d-ROMs were significantly higher than the normal value, in addition to three out of four NCs.  Oxidative stress Evaluation: in the NC group, only two subjects (6.9%) had normal values (above 2200 micromoles) on the Biological Antioxidant Potential (BAP) measure, nine subjects (31%) had a value lower than 2000, and 18 (62%) subjects had a value between 2000 and 2199 micromoles.  Four subjects (13.8%) had normal values (250–300 uCARR) of the d-ROMs measure, 21 subjects (72.4%) had a value greater than 350 uCARR, and four (13.8%) had a value between 300 and 350 uCARR.   Only three (10.3%) subjects had an APOE4 positive tes and none of them had dementia.  In the cohabitants, only seven subjects (14.",ba1feee9-eb21-4030-8928-667eb4e21f72
14,methods14,"3%) had normal values (above 2200 micromoles) on the Biological Antioxidant Potential (BAP) measure, 13 subjects (26.5%) were below 2000, and 24 (49%) between 2000 and 2199 micromoles.  Five subjects (10.2%) had normal values (250–300 U.A.) on the d-ROMs measure, 32 subjects (65.3%) had values greater than 350 U.A., and 12 (24.5%) had values between 300 and 350 U.A.   4. Discussion Several studies have shown that centenarians’ family members have longer survival and are significantly healthier than other controls, thus representing a powerful, informative model for studying the origin of healthy aging and longevity [26,27,28,29,30,31].",f11a56c8-d3a4-49aa-9893-732da25db303
15,methods15," Epidemiological data from different populations (American whites from New England, Mormons from Utah, Ashkenazi Jews residing in the United States, Icelanders, Japanese from Okinawa, and Dutch from Leiden) show how relatives (parents, siblings, and descendants) of long-lived people have significant survival advantage, an increased chance of being or becoming long-lived, have a lower risk of developing serious age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40], and have a favorable lipoprotein profile [41,42]. Parents who later become NC probably adopt a healthier lifestyle for their children [43]. An interesting study of this type was conducted in the Italian population by Bucci [44]. In this study, functional status, instrumental skills, and cognitive status were assessed using the ADL, IADL, and Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) scales, respectively.",697a63b6-94e3-4463-8bd9-b5574f4a21ca
16,methods16," The reported measures as ADL and IADL were chosen since they have psychometric qualities that often do not provide equivalent information to physical tests, as suggested by recently published studies [45]. One of the strengths of this study is the experimental model, which includes the offspring of NC and the offspring of non-long-lived parents born in the same cohort of NCs. All participants were well studied, both at the general clinical level and at the molecular laboratory level. In our opinion, this is relevant since the aging process affects each organ of the body in a different way, giving rise to the so-called “Mosaic of aging” [46].  As the offsprings of NCs emerged as an excellent model for studying human aging and longevity, and longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the susceptibility and impact of diseases.",1ae8db6b-c2b7-46bb-a584-0d9b7d2033d6
17,methods17," Interestingly, in our study, the descendants and controls of the NC were recruited from the same geographical area, which makes it possible to assume that the two groups studied had similar eating lifestyles that may, therefore, be related to appearance, development, and impact of major age-related diseases. These food factors can also play a decisive role in the general health of the elderly, interfering with inflammation, oxidative stress, and the composition of the intestinal microbiota [46]. In Bucci’s study [44], in the group of centenarians’ family members compared to members of the non-centenarians ‘family, better scores on the functional and cognitive scales (ADL and Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE)) were highlighted. In our sample of members of the NC family, although not compared with members of the NC family, all members showed normal values on the Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE), ADL, and IADL scales.",bd6d6405-d438-4d38-af65-2ada975327e8
18,methods18," This finding, therefore, shows similarities with the results obtained by Bucci et al. [44].   All over the world, NCs are generally women, and this aspect seems to be also confirmed in the Cilento population by our pilot study. In Italy, it is generally possible to identify a gradient of gender F:M from the north (7:1) to the south (3:1), while in the province of Nuoro in Sardinia, it becomes equal to 1:1 [47].  As expected, from the results of our study, it is possible to confirm that healthy habits were common in the NC group, including a lower prevalence of smoking compared to cohabitants and healthy eating habits. This is confirmed by the high adherence to the Mediterranean diet assessed by a nutritionist who went to the homes of the study participants to evaluate their daily food intake. These data also showed that a certain amount of daily red wine consumption seems to have a protective effect on the cognitive profile.",43e2c99a-df9e-41be-9179-0a98177acddf
19,methods19," In our study, the NCs indicated moderate alcohol consumption (one to two drinks per day) compared to their younger cohabitants, who were more likely not to drink alcohol at all or to drink more than two alcoholic drinks per day. NCs also tended to remain physically active with daily activities such as gardening and cooking and highly functional as confirmed by the ADL score, although they did not consider themselves as dedicated to regular exercise. A high score on the ADL scale was achieved in over 50% of NCs with substantial equality between the two sexes. On the IADL scale, most of the sample achieved satisfactory results, more women than men.  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive dementia, typically with onset after the age of 60. Studies of twins support the existence of a genetic form of the disease.",6a3af28b-a3bc-4f22-a8e4-bc68b7587949
20,methods20," Indeed, the only gene constantly found in the sporadic association, in various populations, is the apolipoprotein E4 gene (APOE4) [48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56].   Estimates on the prevalence of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are variable (from 3% to 42%), according to the definitions used [57]. In a meta-analysis of 41 cohort studies using Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) with a three-year follow-up, it was found that less than half of them were linked to the development of dementia [58]. In our study, the incidence of dementia was quite low in the NC population. Only in four subjects (13.2%) did doctors clinically diagnose dementia, including vascular dementia in two (6.6%), degenerative dementia in one (3.3%), and mixed dementia in one (3.3%). The measure we used for cognitive assessment was Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) [10,11], the most commonly used tool for screening cognitive functions.",ed2bfcdc-1906-40fb-b8c1-20a6866230b3
21,methods21," Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) is much more sensitive in detecting cognitive problems than informal questions and takes only about 10 minutes to administer, but is limited because it cannot detect memory loss, particularly in patients with a high level of education [12]. In subjects with low educational levels, this test could determine a low score even in the absence of cognitive deficit [26,27], while educated people can obtain a good score even in the presence of cognitive deficit [28]. Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) provides guidance as a measure of retraction (immediate memory) and short-term memory (but not long-term memory) and language functions. Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) may not be an appropriate test in patients with disabilities (e.g. sensory deficits) [10,59].",adae8402-2215-488d-b420-e7292f3f0094
22,methods22," For this reason, in our study, the formulation of the final diagnosis of dementia took into consideration the Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE), but also ADL and IADL scores in addition to the clinical judgment made by general practitioners, and showed a very low percentage of dementia in the group of NC (13.2%). In the group of cohabitants, using the administration of the ADAS-Cog scale, we were able to diagnose amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in four subjects (7.8%), of which only two (3.9%) were children of NC. These subjects scored normal Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE). The functional autonomy scales were not performed in any of the cohabitants because they were all autonomous.  In our sample, only three (10.3%) NC subjects and one cohabitant (8.2%) tested positive for APOE4. Of the three subjects in the NC group with APOE4, none had evidence of dementia, while in the four cohabitants with APOE4 had evidence of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) [60].",65a2068c-fff0-4b49-a592-e9a0e622a913
23,methods23,"  Another aim of our study was to assess the blood oxidative stress, one of the recognized factors related to aging. Mitochondrial function produces reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) by dispersion of intermediates in the electron transport chain [61]. Usually, the harmful activity of a small percentage of these free radicals is neutralized by cellular, enzyme antioxidants (superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase, glutathione peroxidase [GSHP]), and non-enzymes (vitamins E, C, and A). When, however, levels of free radicals increase (due to smoking, drug abuse, ultraviolet radiation, persistent chronic inflammation, etc.), the antioxidant pool is saturated, and excess free radicals damage biological structures. Oxidases and mitochondria are the main producers of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which include highly reactive molecules such as superoxide anion.",92b67dda-fc1e-4260-8e31-2aa6ac28912f
24,methods24," When the production of superoxide anion or H2O2 is so elevated to saturate the reductive capacity of SOD or GSHP, these molecules become substrates for the creation of highly reactive molecules such as hydroxyl (through a reaction of Fenton and Haber–Weiss) that are responsible for damage of cells and tissues [62]. The superoxide anion can react with nitric oxide in a limited reaction that generates peroxynitrite, in turn, a potent reactive oxygen species (ROS). According to this hypothesis of longevity, the oxidation inflammation impacts on aging and healthy aging [61,62,63].  The only study that assessed oxidative stress in a NC population in Cilento [64] showed a slight increase for d-ROMs (324.1, SD 79.4) and values within limits for anti-ROMs 1 and 2 (234.4, SD 99.7 and 1188.8, SD 433.3), reflecting a good overall control of the oxidative balance.",342bf36e-e72a-4c61-a9b9-bfeaf89b3983
25,methods25," In that study [65], the NC population was divided into two groups based on the cognitive state, detected through the Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE), showing that high d-ROMs was significantly higher in the group with cognitive impairment compared to the group with better cognitive performance.   In the present study, Biological Antioxidant Potential (BAP) values were within the normal range in 7% and d-ROMs in 14% of NC cohort. On the other hand, in the cohabiting group, the Biological Antioxidant Potential (BAP) normal values were observed in 14% and d-ROMs in 10% of the subjects. These data suggest that the oxidative stress levels, particularly d-ROMs values, is unchanged with advancing age.",2fc9883e-e336-4a3b-920f-e2a2c53ad517
26,methods26," This substantial uniformity of the values of Biological Antioxidant Potential (BAP) and d-ROMs (p = ns) between NCs and cohabitants appears to be of potential speculative interest as with increasing age, the oxidative damage is expected to increase, while the results in our sample indicate that probably different factors such as genetic substrate, adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle (diet and psychosocial habits), microbiome, etc. could be involved in maintaining this balance unaltered over time, allowing for healthier aging. This observation is indirectly confirmed by results from other studies conducted in Cilento on oxidative stress and cognitive status where the d-ROMs values were found higher than the reference value (324 vs. 371) [65].  We believe that, in speculating on the reason for the good cognitive status of the long-lived Cilento population, it would be useful to refer to the paradigm of disability, disease, and death (disability disease and death (DDD)) [4].",1db69188-dfcb-435a-aff2-abe60de45287
27,methods27," This model suggests that the threshold at which disability disease and death (DDD) can be reached at different speeds in different individuals may be based on interactions between genes that play an important role in inflammation. The functional polymorphisms of Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-10 could be involved in the determination of the inflammation rate (slope), and therefore, of the point (age) where the disability disease and death (DDD) threshold is intercepted. Using this model in the interpretation of the data obtained in our population, it seems that the threshold of frailty/cognitive well-being can be influenced not only by genetic-inflammatory factors but also by a combination of other factors such as oxidation stress and lifestyle. In the future, it may be important to evaluate other parameters such as the microbiome, environmental determinants, specific nutrients, etc. in a larger NC population in different regions of the world.",6f066a91-aa0b-4199-8f52-5b044cbc1161
28,methods28," At the same time, other lifestyle factors such as physical, cognitive, and social activity, the consumption of red wine and positive personality traits such as the ability to recover, optimism, religiosity, and wisdom [7] may possibly contribute to health and longevity. Recent studies have shown that resilience and wisdom can be improved in the elderly through psychosocial interventions, resulting in a reduction of stress levels [64,66].  5. Conclusions According to the results of this pilot study on a limited sample of NCs from the Cilento region in Southern Italy, NCs seem to have a good cognitive status without significant differences in the oxidative stress and the APOE genotype when compared to younger cohabitants aging 50–65 years.",4e763947-3b1b-4d97-8643-70443f7f37d8
29,methods29," These results might be associated with optimal adherence to Mediterranean diet by the NC subjects, although the possible impact of other lifestyle factors as well as positive personality traits like resilience and wisdom on health and longevity should also be considered. Further studies on a larger population looking at more complex evaluations should be performed to confirm the results from this pilot study.
