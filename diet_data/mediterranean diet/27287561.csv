0,methods0,"Our series included eleven NF1 patients identified on the basis of the National Institutes of Health (National Institutes of Health (NIH)) Consensus Conference criteria (National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement: Neurofibromatosis 1988), clinically followed up at our Division of Neurology, Neurofibromatosis and Rare Diseases Center of the University Hospital, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Italy (Table 1). Of these eleven patients, seven lacked a family history of NF1.  Eight patients were screened for NF1 mutations (see Table 1). Genetic testing revealed that six of them carried a mutation producing truncated neurofibromin, as confirmed by a new diagnostic technique recently described by our group [17]; Patient 9 presented a single-nucleotide mutation, while Patient 3 presented a newly discovered intragenic heterozygous deletion encompassing exon 12 and 13 [18].  2.1.",dc2a8e9c-d579-4d61-9f85-ba9c9c89624d
1,methods1," Methods The NF1 patients were divided into four groups on the basis of their dietary regimen: the first group (n = 2) was instructed to follow a Western diet (WesDiet); the second (n = 3) a traditional Mediterranean-style diet (MedDiet); the third (n = 3) a Western diet enriched with curcumin (WesDietCurcumin); and the fourth (n = 3) a traditional Mediterranean-style diet enriched with curcumin (MedDietCurcumin). All the diets were evaluated by a dietitian. In particular, the Western diet included ad libitum the consumption of red and processed meat, refined grains, French fries, sweets and desserts. No total calorie restriction was advised.  The traditional Mediterranean-style diet included the abundant use of olive oil for cooking and dressing dishes (extra-virgin olive oil—50 mL/day with >2000 mg/kg total phenol concentration as determined by Folin-Ciocalteu’s assay—Sigma Aldrich, St.",897922da-fcac-47fc-a518-d3dceb203e5f

Curcumin was supplemented at a dose of 1200 mg to the third and fourth groups at lunchtime [19,20]. Finally, all patients were invited to restrict foods known to contain curcumin.  Physical activity was not specifically advised for all NF1 patients. Compliance with the program was assessed by attendance at the follow-up visits and completion of the diet diaries. The patients were seen at two-monthly intervals over the six months of follow-up, after the introduction of the different diets.",163fb7cc-6ded-4d76-8a12-429c25ef0fb3
3,methods3," A complete physical examination, an evaluation of plasmatic curcumin level, integrated by photographic documentation were performed at each visit. Manual counting one by one of cutaneous neurofibromas was performed on all images (to facilitate the counting process, images were re-elaborated using Photoshop® software by Adobe Systems Software, Belfast, Ireland).   When appropriate, magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) was performed. Head MR was performed using a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unit (Philips Gyroscan) including axial Spin-Echo T1, Turbo Spin-Echo (Turbo Spin Echo (TSE)) T2 and FLAIR (slice thickness: 5 mm), coronal FLAIR (slice thickness 3 mm), sagittal Turbo Spin Echo (TSE) T2 (slice thickness: 4 mm) and axial DWI (Diffusion Weighted Imaging).

The patients’ nutritional status was evaluated applying a combination of clinical observation, bioimpedentiometric analysis and anthropometric and biochemical parameters.  2.2. Ethics This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee and Safety Board of the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects (protocol number 479/13). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before admission to the study and to allow the initiation of any study-related procedures.

The resulting mixture was then thoroughly vortexed and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to hydrolyze the phase-2 conjugates of curcuminoids. After incubation, curcuminoids were extracted with 2 volumes of methanol/chloroform (1:2 v/v), sonicated in a water bath for 15 min and evaporated to dryness at 30 °C under negative pressure in a centrifugal concentrator. This process was repeated for a total of two extractions. The dried extract was reconstituted in methanol and subjected to HPLC analysis.  2.4. Chromatographic Analysis of Curcuminoids The HPLC-UV procedure was conducted according to Heath et al. [21] with some modification. The analysis was carried out on Agilent 1260 Infinity Quaternary LC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a DAD (Diode-Array Detector). The chromatographic separation was performed on a Gemini® 5 µm C18 110 Å, LC Column 250 × 4.",5fe439c8-a2ac-4c0c-be12-c2f9b398b503

A linear elution gradient consisting of a mobile phase A (0.1% acetic acid), B (Acetonitrile), and C (Methanol) was programmed as follows: initially 50% A, 45% B, and 5% C, linearly changed to 30% A, 65% B, and 5% C over 5 min, and then held for 4 min at 30% A, 65% B, and 5% C. The system was then re-equilibrated for 5 min with the initial solvent. The detection wavelength was set at 420 nm. The quantitation of curcuminoids is by peak area ratio (curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin to internal standard) and is based on a standard curve in a plasma or urine matrix, generated by using an external standard to spike plasma or urine. A linear curve is generated from a single analysis of six different standard concentrations.",51434bed-3874-4ef8-9f4e-b50fa8c6f85e

Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was conducted using a one-way ANOVA test, with the significant differences determined at p < 0.05, using GraphPad Prism Version 5.04 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).  3. Results Patients 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 did not adhere to the MedDiet and did not significantly modify their dietary habits, which were consistent with a WesDiet; among them, Patient 6, 7 and 8 agreed to introduce curcumin to their diet (WesDietCurcumin). Patients 3, 4 and 5 followed a MedDiet. Patients 9, 10 and 11 agreed to follow a MedDietCurcumin. As shown in Table 1, all patients presented a clinical picture characterized by more than six cafè-au-lait spots, intertriginous freckling and both cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas; patients 2, 3, 4, 7 and 11 presented plexiform neurofibromas.",d9700b4c-ee12-41bb-ae8a-aed7176a0789
8,methods8," NF1 complications were present in patients 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11 with scoliosis, in patient 4 with short stature, and in patients 1 and 2 with optic pathway glioma [22]. Patients 3, 6 and 8 presented cerebrovascular abnormalities, which are a common occurrence in NF1 [23]. In particular, patient 3 presented very rare bilateral aneurysms of both internal carotid arteries, as extensively described in a previous report [18]. Patients 1, 2, 3 and 4 had a family history of NF1.  3.1. Follow-Up Clinical follow-up integrated by self-assessment of outcome in the first (WesDiet—patients 1 and 2), second (MedDiet—patients 3, 4 and 5) and third group (WesDietCurcumin—patients 6, 7 and 8) did not detect significant phenotypic variations in the number, size and color of cutaneous neurofibromas or in other signs and symptoms of disease, clinically detectable, at the different time points, compared to baseline. Patient 9 (Table 1), a 54-year-old woman, showed a severe cutaneous phenotype.",35c6f697-bafd-48a9-94e6-21fab5aed8ab
9,methods9," Her medical history was notable for numerous surgical removals of limb and trunk lesions, histologically defined as neurofibromas (Figure 1a–g). A comprehensive physical examination performed at baseline showed widespread cafè-au-lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling and numerous cutaneous neurofibromas on the neck, trunk, upper and lower limbs and perianal area. These neurofibromas varied in size and shape, with both sessile and pedunculated forms widely represented; they were soft and not painful to the touch. While most smaller neurofibromas were flesh-colored, the area located between the right anterior and posterior axillary lines comprised several tumors with a brownish-red color; a larger, round, pedunculated neurofibroma was particularly prominent (Figure 2a). In this area a manual count of 212 distinct neurofibromas was made (Figure 2b).",38871702-f067-44f9-9855-d6b287b91077
10,methods10," Six months after the introduction of MedDietCurcumin, as shown in Figure 2c,d, there was a striking reduction in the number of neurofibromas compared to baseline. In fact, at this follow-up appointment, only 110 (51%) neurofibromas were detected (Figure 2f). Besides a decrease in the number of neurofibromas, a decrease in their volume was observed, particularly evident for the larger neurofibromas, which appeared to be considerably smaller in size, lighter in color, and softer to the touch.  Patient 10, (Table 1), a 27-year-old woman diagnosed in infancy due to the presence of more than six cafè-au-lait spots; during adolescence, she developed axillary freckling and several neurofibromas. Prior to the introduction of MedDietCurcumin, she presented diffuse cafè-au-lait spots, bilateral axillary and inguinal freckling and cutaneous neurofibromas of various sizes on the trunk and limbs.",a9893717-cac5-4595-8f97-cc421be4883c
11,methods11," Several sessile and pedunculated cutaneous neurofibromas were observed on the left breast, and in particular in the areolar area (Figure 3a); in the area selected, we counted 20 neurofibromas (Figure 3b). At the six-month follow-up, she presented a reduction in the volume of several cutaneous neurofibromas in the area selected. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the number of neurofibromas (30%) was evident, as shown in Figure 3c,d and in the histogram in Figure 3e.  Patient 11 (Table 1), a 50-year-old man at the time of our first observation. Since childhood, he presented cafè-au-lait spots and subcutaneous neurofibromas on the trunk and lower limbs; he had also developed a large formation in the left orbito-temporal region, which had been partially resected when he was 44 years old; this lesion had been histologically diagnosed as a plexiform neurofibroma.",63799515-c22e-4fe1-a762-81cf08cdc299
12,methods12," During the following two years, the residual neurofibroma had increased in volume, infiltrating the ipsilateral orbital cavity and compressing the eyeball and causing partial left palpebral ptosis. Clinical examination of the lesion at baseline showed a large subcutaneous mass originating from the left upper eyelid and reaching the temporal region. It had a gray-rosy color, indistinct margins, soft elastic consistency and was not painful to the touch. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline (Figure 4a,c,e) showed pseudo-nodular formations (neurofibromas) in the left fronto-parietal-temporal area, extending to the ipsilateral orbital region. Six months later, the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 4b,d,f) showed a clear volume reduction in this plexiform neurofibroma, especially visible in axial Turbo Spin Echo (TSE) T2 weighted slices of the inferior portion (Figure 4e,f). The total volume reduction was around 28%.  3.2.",08cbeaff-3496-4a86-8210-e2fa110b9b67
13,methods13," Nutritional and Bioimpedentiometric Data From a metabolic point of view, as shown in Table 2, no significant changes in BMI in the WesDiet group (patients 1 and 2) or WesDietCurcumin (6–8) were observed.  All patients following a Mediterranean diet with curcumin supplementation (9, 10 and 11) or without curcumin (3, 4 and 5) presented a general improvement in their metabolic status, with a BMI reduction and an increase in body hydration, due to the greater intake of water; in all of these patients, the percentage of fat-free mass (fat free mass (FFM)), and basal metabolism (basal metabolism (BMR)) increased. Phase angle (PA) improved in the Mediterranean and MedDietCurcumin patients, with the exception of patient 11, for whom it remained stable. Na/K exchange remained essentially unchanged in all of these patients.  No patient reported any side effects of curcumin consumption  3.3.",8e439679-73e7-4c5b-8d53-25f8caed82a9
14,methods14," Plasma Curcuminoid Level The curcumin supplemented dietary regimen was established on the basis of previous clinical studies for inflammatory conditions, where active dosages of around 1–2 g/day of curcuminoid were used [19,20]. For this study, subjects consumed, in association with Western or traditional Mediterranean-style diet, 1200 mg total curcuminoids. Once absorbed, curcumin is subjected to conjugations like sulfation and glucuronidation at various tissue sites. For this reason, all plasma samples were treated with Helix pomatia glucuronidase/sulfatase before HPLC analysis. Our data (Figure 5) demonstrated that the plasma level of curcumin increased linearly over sixth months in patients who consumed the MedDietCurcumin, reaching a final plasma concentration ranging from 49.2 ± 1.0 ng/mL to 79.0 ± 3.6 ng/mL. Conversely, patients treated with a Western diet supplemented with curcumin showed very low plasma concentrations of curcumin even after sixth months of diet.",11b482d5-d830-4bf2-8d64-41f4a1476bc0
15,methods15," Taken together, our results demonstrate that a traditional Mediterranean-style diet improves curcuminoid bioavailability.  4. Discussion The association between NF1 and malignant tumors (gliomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST)), leukemia and rhabdomyosarcoma) has been largely described [24]. The mutation is highly penetrant: by age 20, almost 100% of the mutation carriers will manifest the disease in some form [25]. NF1 is notable for its high phenotypic variability, both within and between families, which means that family members carrying the exact same mutation may present with vastly different clinical pictures [26]. Multiple factors have been put forward as mechanisms underlying this variability, including modifying genes [27], allelic heterogeneity, mutation in the second allele, somatic mosaicism, epigenetic events and exposure to environmental agents [28,29].",32068caa-016c-4c08-ba31-192256a71a3c
16,methods16,"   Here we report the beneficial effects of a traditional Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) enriched with curcumin (MedDietCurcumin) on the number and size of neurofibromas in all NF1 patients consuming this diet (patients 9–11). Indeed, besides the improvement in the general metabolic status, and particularly of the lipid profile, we observed a marked reduction in the number (ranging from 30 to 51%) and volume of neurofibromas after six months of MedDietCurcumin. Notably, the large cranial plexiform neurofibroma in patient 11 exhibited a marked volume reduction (28.2%), as shown by a conventional imaging method. In contrast, we observed no significant effect on the pattern of neurofibromas in the patients who did not follow MedDietCurcumin.  Epidemiological evidence and many case-control studies suggest that a Mediterranean diet plays a pivotal role in lowering the risk of several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, and cancer.",1a61a164-56ca-4c6f-bd65-291689bd53b1
17,methods17," A high intake of olive oil is considered a hallmark of the traditional Mediterranean diet. In this study, we used extra-virgin olive oil (EVO—the juice of the olive obtained solely by pressing and consumed without any further refining process) having >2000 mg/kg total phenol concentration. It has been reported that EVO consumption increases the monounsaturated fatty acid content in phospholipids and cholesterol esters by modifying the fatty acid composition of the plasma membrane, which influences the association of G proteins and PKCa with the lipid bilayer in elderly persons with type 2 diabetes [30]. The authors demonstrated that after consuming EVO for 4 weeks, the patients showed a significant increase in the total amount of monounsaturated fatty acid, mostly due to a rise in the proportion of oleic acid and a decrease in saturated fatty acids, which influences the membrane fluidity [31].",d7527190-c7b1-4276-8115-e8894ff70698
18,methods18," In addition, the EVO used contained a high level of naturally occurring phenolic compounds, the key feature of prevention of a number of diseases and pathological conditions (i.e., cancer and several aging-associated degenerative diseases) [32,33]. Increasing studies highlight the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of the two major EVO components, oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, on cancer cells and show that these effects stem from different mechanisms depending on the cell type. For example, these polyphenols are able to reduce angiogenesis via downregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, prostanoid production and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) protein release, together with a reduction in intracellular ROS levels and NFκB activation [34,35,36,37].",3a0af633-9dc1-42a1-81c8-10292217add4
19,methods19," Moreover, polyphenols stimulate apoptosis by activating pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and PI3K/AKT signaling in pancreatic cancer and hepatoma cells, and increasing the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (cJNK), p53, p21, Bax and cytochrome c cytoplasmic concentration in HeLa and cervix carcinoma cells [38,39,40]. Furthermore, in breast cancer cells, p53 or the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1/30 (GPER1/GPR30) pathway activation has also been shown, as well as the inhibition of the anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferation protein NFκB and cyclin D1, its main oncogenic target [41]. Moreover, the ability of curcumin to target multiple signaling pathways that are linked to tumorigenesis in NF1 represents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention [42,43].   In particular, curcumin has been extensively studied for its role in Ras oncogenic signaling pathways, notably by abolishing the RAS-ERK signaling mechanism [44].",5a78a622-b9eb-451d-b913-97f239e8b61e
20,methods20," Depending on the cell type and stimulus, ERK activity mediates different antiproliferative events, such as apoptosis, autophagy and senescence in vitro and in vivo [45]. Findings in the last decade have demonstrated intriguing effects of curcumin in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling [46,47]. For instance, curcumin induces G2-M arrest and autophagy in malignant glioma cells through the inhibition of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K and activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 pathways, suggesting that autophagy-mediated cell death might be pathway-specific [48]. In addition, preclinical studies show that curcumin induces apoptosis and G2–M arrest in cancer cells by generating superoxides, increasing caspase-3, caspase-7, and PARP cleavage, downregulating Akt phosphorylation, and upregulating p53 phosphorylation [49].",e8706e1f-11be-488b-be33-ea148c001b15
21,methods21," Curcumin also promotes selective tumor cell death and inhibits proliferation of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Huh7 cells), providing unequivocal evidence of intricate cross-talk between autophagy and cell death [50]. Another study demonstrated that curcumin increases the sensitivity of neurofibromin deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) cells to TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), downregulating anti-apoptotic proteins [51,52]. Curcumin may also exert an anti-proliferative effect by decreasing the enzymatic activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R). In fact, NF1 Schwann cells exhibit an aberrant EGF-R expression, which has been linked to increased cellular proliferation and malignancy [53].",6fd07305-a016-477d-8cf2-b6f824e6ca09
22,methods22,"   Unfortunately, while curcumin is one of the most used nutraceuticals, its utility as a therapeutic agent is limited by its poor water solubility, short biological half-life, and low bioavailability after oral administration in certain tissues. Therefore, various approaches including the use of adjuvants, liposomes, nanoparticles, phospholipid complexes and reformulation with various oils have been tried [54]. Interestingly, our six-month observation results show that only the patients who followed the MedDietCurcumin exhibited a plasmatic increase in curcumin concentration, indicating an improvement of curcuminoid bioavailability. We can speculate that the simultaneous presence of a high dietary concentration of EVO polyphenols and/or fatty acids contributes to this enhancement, and, consequently, to the positive effect on reducing NF1 symptoms.",e3e90293-657c-4f8d-a104-dbed96f685bc
23,methods23," However, this study has some limitations, such as the small number of participants and the short-term exposure to MedDietCurcumin, but we can hypothesize that the regular consumption of polyphenol-rich olive oil and curcumin can maintain the effects observed in this study.   5. Conclusions NF1 presents a unique situation in which the existence of widespread neurofibromas, and their tendency to recur, calls for more effective and sustainable medical intervention than the simple surgical removal of individual lesions. The results presented in this study are of particular interest as they are the first clinical demonstration of the therapeutic activity on NF1 of curcumin in combination with a dietary approach rich in polyphenols.  As shown by our data, the plasma level of curcumin increased in patients following MedDietCurcumin; this suggests that curcuminoid bioavailability is positively influenced by polyphenol-rich foods in the Mediterranean diet.",fe815c0a-a9fe-43df-be81-060dc6ed2683
24,methods24," However, this synergism between curcumin and polyphenols needs to be confirmed on a larger cohort of NF1 patients.  Further studies are necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which MedDietCurcumin is able to reduce both the number and volume of neurofibromas. In addition, clinical trials involving new nanoformulations of curcumin conjugated with long-term observations may provide further data on the potential therapeutic role of curcumin in NF1 as well as in other inherited or sporadic cancer syndromes.
