Daidzein (daidzein (DAI)), (±) enterodiol (ED) (Cat# 45198-5MG-F), (±) enterolactone (EL) (Cat# 45199-1MG-F), genistein (genistein (GEN)) and (±) secoisolariciresinol (secoisolariciresinol (SECO)) (Cat# 60372-5MG-F) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). S-Equol was purchased from Chembest (Shanghai, China). Antipyrine, corticosterone, ketoprofen, ranitidine, theophylline and verapamil were purchased as parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) controls from Pion, Inc. (Billerica, MA, USA).  4.2. In Silico ADME Predictors The in silico tool SwissADME was used as a measure to predict BBB and gut permeability. Predicted permeability was assessed for each individual compound and control, as previously explained [56].  4.3.",54aafbf7-07ea-4558-ac06-37a221c3d780
1,methods1," Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA)) Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay was performed to analyze both blood–brain barrier (BBB) and gut passive permeability. All materials for parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) were purchased from Pion, Inc (Billerica, MA, USA). Both the gut and BBB assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, test compounds and standards were prepared at 10 mM concentrations in Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). For the gut assay, Prisma HT buffer was adjusted to pHs 5, 6.2, and 7.4 by adding 0.5 M NaOH. In the deepwell plate provided by Pion, 1 mL of each pH-adjusted buffer was added to separate wells. For each pH, 5 µL of the sample was added to the 1 mL of buffer then mixed thoroughly with a pipette, diluting the sample to a final concentration of 50 µM.",7647855f-7675-4ce3-85b1-5dc45d07d6ae
2,methods2," Next, 200 µl of the diluted sample was added to the donor (bottom) plate from the Pion sandwich assay, 5 µL of GIT lipid matrix was added to the membrane on the bottom of the acceptor plate, and 200 µL of acceptor sink buffer was added in each well of the acceptor plate. The sandwich was assembled, and the plate incubated at room temperature for 4 h undisturbed. In BBB assays, compounds (10 mM) were diluted to final concentrations of 50 µM in Prisma HT Buffer (pH = 7.4). The parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) sandwich was created with the donor (bottom), BBB artificial membrane, and brain sink buffer as the acceptor (top). The assay was performed for 1 h at room temperature with shaking (60 µm) using the manufacturer-supplied GIT Box. After incubation, the UV profiles of the donor and acceptor plates were read on the SpectraMax plate reader connected to the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) software.",0f7823ca-80b2-47df-852c-fdc3f1f9a231
3,methods3," parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) software calculated the –log Pe values for each compound and standard using the UV profiles of the donor and acceptor plates. Standards were all within 0.25 units of the expected value provided by parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) and each sample was averaged with 4 replicates.  4.4. Cell Culture Conditions Murine microglia (BV-2) were generously provided by Dr. Grace Sun of the University of Missouri at Columbia. Cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) sterile filtered and heat inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum in addition to 1% (v/v) Penicillin/Streptomycin Antibiotic Solution (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Cells were incubated at approximately 65% relative humidity at 37 °C under atmospheric oxygen and 5% CO2.",d00b8e82-f26c-44b2-87ac-e06ed4693501
4,methods4," Cells were passaged using Trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD USA), enumerated, and checked for viability using Trypan blue (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) dye exclusion. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used to dissolve compounds and did not exceed 0.1% when incubated with cells.  4.5. Cell Viability The cytotoxicity of each compound was determined in BV-2. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96 white-walled, clear bottom plates at 100,000 cells/mL. Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h. Compounds were prepared to 10 mM in Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), then diluted in serum-free media to yield concentrations of 20 and 10 μM. Cells were treated with prepared concentrations of each compound for 24 h. Cellular viability was determined as a percentage of control (Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)) by Cell Titer Glo 2.0 (CTG; Promega, Madison, WI, USA), read for luminescence on the SpectraMax M2 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).  4.6.",3f54c17d-255a-4bb9-84c0-11b72311943a
5,methods5," lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Stimulation of Murine Microglia BV-2 Cells As previously published, BV-2 cells were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/mL in 24-well plates [57]. After reaching a confluency of 85%, cells were exposed to either Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), secoisolariciresinol (SECO) (10 μM), ED (10 μM), EL (10 μM), genistein (GEN) (20, 10 μM), daidzein (DAI) (20, 10 μM), or EQ (20, 10 μM), for 1 h prior to incubation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 μg/mL) for 23 h. Media were collected, aliquoted for nitric oxide and cytokine analysis.  4.7. Quantification of Nitric Oxide Nitric oxide was detected in BV-2 culture media following the stimulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 h from the previously described experiment by way of the Griess Assay (Promega, Madison WI), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.  4.8.",ed128366-de30-4514-8a08-bf8a6e1b6083
6,methods6," Measurement of IL-6 and TNF-α IL-6 and TNF-α were measured from BV-2 media using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)) provided by Biolegend (San Diego, CA, USA) [57].  4.9. Statistical Analysis All data are reported as mean ± standard errors of at least three independent biological samples. The analysis of all cellular data was conducted by ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test or Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons of group means. The significance of the toxic agent compared to the control group is presented as p ≤ 0.001 (###) and p ≤ 0.0001 (####). The significance for tests compared to toxic treatment was defined as: p ≤ 0.03 (*), p ≤ 0.002 (**), p ≤ 0.0002 (***) and p ≤ 0.0001 (****). GraphPad Prism software 7.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used for all statistical analysis calculations and graphical representations. ",ad7bc591-3dd4-4a7f-962c-782a4c14fc0c
