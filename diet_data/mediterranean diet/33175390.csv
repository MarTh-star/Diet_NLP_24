Design and Setting of the Study  This cross-sectional study was based on the survey of Chronic Disease and Nutrition Monitoring in Adults in Inner Mongolia in 2015. A multi-stage cluster random sampling method was used to obtain representative samples. A total of 841 participants aged 40–59 years were enrolled in this study.

Data Collection  All participants completed a questionnaire including information on sociodemographic characteristics, health-related behaviors, and diet. Height and weight were measured by trained investigators who followed standard protocols. 24-h dietary recall for three consecutive days was used to collect dietary data, all participants reviewed and described the types and amounts of all foods (including alcohol) they consumed.  Measurements  Assessment of Diet Quality  The Alternate Mediterranean Diet score (aMeds) was used to evaluate participants’ adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The range of aMeds is 0–9. The higher the score, the better the diet quality. The aMeds components include whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, fish, and the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat. Intake above the sex-specific median is scored as 1 point, others are scored as 0 points.",29e9f6cf-ef36-44a7-bbb3-32197f69e88c

For alcohol, 1 point is given if consumption between 5 and 15 g per day; others are assigned 0 points [24].  Assessment of Average Intake of Each Food Group  Based on the dietary data from 24-h dietary recall for three consecutive days, the average intake (g/day) of each food group was calculated among participants over 3 days [25].  Definition of Overweight and Obesity  body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, which was used as an indicator of overweight and obesity. body mass index (BMI) was divided into two categories: underweight or normal weight (<24 kg/m2) and overweight and obesity (≥24 kg/m2) [26].",c6ee2739-c604-4678-9652-0ecb669231f1

Covariates  Sociodemographic characteristics included age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, residing location, and education level. Health-related behaviors were smoking status, drinking, and physical activity. The definition of variables was showed in Supplementary Table S1.  Statistical Analysis  Continuous variables were expressed as means and standard deviations, and the t-test was used for two groups comparisons.

7,results1,"  socioeconomic status dietary quality alternate Mediterranean diet score overweight and obesity economic transition ==== Body pmcIntroduction  Overweight and obesity are risk factors for many chronic non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer [1, 2]. In recent years, the prevalence of overweight and obesity increased globally which accompanied by severe health damage and lower life quality among people [3]. 2017 Global Burden of Disease study showed that high body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was the fourth risk factor leading to death [4]. Obesity had a great impact on middle-aged people [5], their lifestyle risk factors (smoking, unhealthy diet, or inadequate physical activity) could significantly increase the risk of chronic diseases in their old age [6–8]. The effective control of overweight and obesity among middle-aged people can significantly reduce the incidence of obesity-related chronic disease in their old age [9].",50c51283-b15d-4b4e-b4ff-bccb6c12ba06
8,results2,"  Socioeconomic status (socioeconomic status (SES)) has an influence on overweight and obesity [10]. Generally, the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and the risk of obesity is negative in high-income countries [11]. However, in some low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), people in high socioeconomic status (SES) suffered a higher risk of overweight and obesity [12, 13]. Among the top 10 countries ranked by obese people number, eight countries were LMICs, including Brazil, China, India, etc., [14].  Diet quality plays an important role in the development of overweight and obesity in different socioeconomic status (SES) participants. Some studies showed that high socioeconomic status (SES) participants would adhere to healthy diet [15, 16]. A review of 29 meta-analyses demonstrated that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet could reduce overall mortality, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality of cancer [17].",b75fdbdb-1618-4496-b1bb-afbd1524ff10
9,results3," However, some studies showed that some high socioeconomic status (SES) individuals tended to choose some unhealthy dietary patterns, such as rich in animal fats or sugar which may relate to a higher risk of overweight and obesity [18, 19].  China is a middle-income country, and Inner Mongolia is an underdeveloped region in the north of the country. In recent decades, Inner Mongolia has been in a period of rapid economic development. In 2015, the prevalence of obesity was 18.1% [20], which was in a high level in China (11.3%) [21]. Our previous studies illustrated that people in Inner Mongolia deviated from healthy diet, and the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes were high in adults [22, 23]. Based on previous studies, we aimed to explore the relationship of socioeconomic status (SES), diet quality and overweight and obesity in adults aged 40–59 years in Inner Mongolia, for the purpose of contributing to the effective prevention and control of the overweight and obesity.",7c35dc98-4766-4d85-a2ee-dfa4ffb80d9d

The participants deviated from a healthy diet, and 69.7% of the participants in low diet quality had overweight and obesity. In past 10 years, participants were facing increased dietary problems and the risk of overweight and obesity in Inner Mongolia.  Comparisons with Other Studies  Previous evidence demonstrated that high socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with better health outcomes [29–31]. However, with the rapid development of economic in LMICs, individuals in high socioeconomic status (SES) suffered a higher risk of obesity compared with low socioeconomic status (SES) [32].",6439e457-e7d5-44b7-93ba-bee925129c7c
17,discussion1," In our study, high socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with a higher risk of overweight and obesity, and the OR was 1.351.

A study covering 757,958 participants showed that 70–90% burden of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity was concentrated in high socioeconomic status (SES) group [35].  Modifiable dietary characteristics are important explanatory factors for the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and overweight and obesity. Some studies demonstrated that individuals in high socioeconomic status (SES) adhered to relatively healthy dietary patterns [16, 36, 37]. In contrast, some individuals in high socioeconomic status (SES) who were able to obtain excess food, tended to choose a high-fat and high-calorie diet during the economic transition in LMICs [18, 38].",027f65a2-6613-4874-83f9-59914e731b10

Similarly, our study also showed that diet quality had a significant mediating effect on the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and the risk of overweight and obesity. Participants in high socioeconomic status (SES) had a relatively high intake of red and processed meat, which resulted in poorer diet quality, leading to a higher risk of overweight and obesity. More importantly, the indirect effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on overweight and obesity was also significant, working mainly through the intake of red and processed meat. Our result also showed that the intake of red and processed meat in all participants was higher than the RNI, especially in high socioeconomic status (SES) participants.

Strengths and Limitations  This study was based on the survey of Chronic Disease and Nutrition Monitoring in Adults in Inner Mongolia in 2015 conducted in urban, agricultural, and pastoral areas. A multi-stage cluster random sampling method was used to obtain a representative sample of participants. However, this cross-sectional study could only show the association of socioeconomic status (SES) and diet quality with the risk of overweight and obesity, but unable to demonstrate causality of them. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to conduct more prospective studies on the complex effects of socioeconomic status (SES) and diet quality on the risk of overweight and obesity among middle-aged people especially in LMICs.",c9d6a0f7-cb76-400c-a151-d78e82c125bb
