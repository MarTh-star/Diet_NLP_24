0,methods0,"5.1. Plant Materials Plant material was collected from wild populations in three different locations in Central Italy, Perugia (43°06′39.2′′N 12°20′53.6′′E, 350 m a.s.l., in the surroundings of a residential building, probably subspontaneous), Novele (42°45′50.6′′N 13°20′35.0′′E, 550 m a.s.l., AP, close to the main road) and Pescosansonesco (42°14′31.4′′N 13°52′29.8′′E, PE, 530 m a.s.l., on a calcareous cliff). From each site a representative sampling (at least ten plants) was done, taking care to avoid causing damage to the wild population. Sampling was performed on March and May 2016, in order to collect plants during the vegetative phase (PF—pre-flowering stage) and in full bloom (F—flowering). The botanical identity was confirmed by a senior taxonomist (Prof. F. Tammaro) and voucher specimens are conserved in the Herbarium of the Department of Pharmacy, “G. d’Annunzio” University of Chieti-Pescara (Italy).",bc9cfb32-ba9f-4f58-adca-5d017c6bc16d
1,methods1," Each plant was manually separated in root (R), aerial parts (AP, consisting in stem and leaves) and flowers (Fl) and air-dried in an oven at 40 ± 1 °C, until achievement of constant weight. Then plant material was ground using a mixer grinder to a fine powder, passing through a 40 mesh sieve to obtain a uniform granulometry and stored in a vacuum box in the dark at 4 °C until use. Methanol extracts were obtained by maceration with 250 mL of organic solvent at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C) overnight, as previously reported [50].  5.2. Chemicals All the phenolic chemical standards (gallic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, epicatechin, syringic acid, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-benzaldehyde, p-coumaric acid, rutin, sinapic acid, trans-ferulic acid, naringin, 2,3-dimethoxy-benzoic acid, benzoic acid, o-coumaric acid, quercetin, trans-cinnamic acid, naringenin) (purity ˃ 98%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Milan, Italy).",6d935ad2-6d64-4b18-8d98-bd4efb3d2db0
2,methods2," Methanol (HPLC-grade), formic acid (99%), nitric acid (65%, supra-pure metal grade) and sulfuric acid (98%, ultrapure grade) were obtained from Carlo Erba Reagents (Milan, Italy). Double-distilled water was obtained using a Millipore Milli-Q Plus water treatment system (Millipore Bedford Corp., Bedford, MA, USA). Standard metal solutions of Cd(II), Cu(II), Pb(II) and Zn(II) (1000 mg L−1, suprapure grade), hydrochloric acid (30%) and sodium acetate (anhydrous, analytical grade) were purchased by Merck (Darmstad, Germany). Anthraquinone chemical standards (all ˃99%) were purchased from Extrasynthese (Genay, France).  5.3. Total Bioactive Components (Phenolics and Flavonoids) Total phenolic content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric method [51], and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAEs/g extract). Total flavonoid content was determined by previously reported method [52] and expressed as rutin equivalents (REs/g extract).  5.4.",5d673d0d-4e00-4558-ab37-e194be0d5002
3,methods3," HPLC Analyses for Phenolics and Anthraquinones High-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-PDA) was employed. Phenolic as well as anthraquinone patterns were evaluated by validated methods reported in the literature [35,53], using an HPLC Waters liquid chromatography (model 600 solvent pump, 2996 DAD, Waters S.p.A., Milford, MA, USA). Mobile phase was directly degassed on-line using a Biotech 4CH DEGASI Compact (Onsala, Sweden). Empower v.2 Software (Waters S.p.A., Milford, MA, USA) was used to collect and analyse data.  For the quantitative analyses on investigated compounds (both anthraquinones and phenolics), the HPLC-PDA methods were validated using external calibration (for the identification of the analytes retention times, and UV/Vis spectra) with pure chemical standards at different concentration levels.",24be3ab0-d1e4-4cbf-bc4d-1d73c8eee694
4,methods4," Precision and trueness were validated using fortified samples (with pure chemical standard working solutions) at three different concentration levels and the results fulfil international guideline references [35,53]. The instrument configurations, using also a column oven for the reproducibility of the analytes retention times, and the validated methods allow to the correct identification and quantification of the investigated compounds.   5.5. Heavy Metals Determination Cd(II), Cu(II), Pb(II) and Zn(II) were determined by differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry (differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry (DPASV)). An AMEL Mod. 433 Multipolarograph (AMEL Instrumentation s.r.l., Milan, Italy), equipped with a hanging mercury drop electrode (hanging mercury drop electrode (HDME)) as working electrode, Ag|AgCl|KClsatd. as reference electrode and a platinum-wire auxiliary electrode [54], was employed.",b54cee87-a577-4212-bdfe-373d669735e6
5,methods5," The supporting electrolyte was an acetic acid/sodium acetate buffer (1 M, pH = 4.65).  The relevant instrumental parameters were the following. Initial potential: Ei = −1.300 V; deposition potential: Ed = −1.300 V; final potential: Ef = 0.100 V; electrodeposition time: td = 120 s; delay time before the potential sweep: tr = 5 s; potential scan rate: dE/dt = 20 mV/s; stirring rate: r = 600 r.p.m.; the potential values were referred to Ag|AgCl|KClsatd..  Each sample was previously digested by acid attack [55]: 0.25 g of plant sample was put in a 100-mL Pyrex digestion tube, and 20 mL of a mixture 1:1 of nitric acid and sulfuric acid was added. The tube, connected to a Vigreux column condenser, was then heated at 180 °C for 120 min. For the analytical measures, 15 mL of buffer solution and 300 μL of the digested solution were put into the voltammetric cell, and then 3 standard additions of 300 μL of a solution containing all the four metals at 10 mg L−1 were carried on.",4f0782bd-1d49-4ea1-bf8f-6a198e61f79d
6,methods6," For each addition, two replicates were performed. The blank was obtained by mixing 15 mL of buffer solution and 300 μL of a digested solution containing only the mixture 1:1 of nitric acid and sulfuric acid. Finally, for each sample a standard addition line for each metal was computed, using peak areas as dependent variable and the metal content was extrapolated. The limit of detection (LoD) was calculated using the three-sigma approach, as in previous works [56].  5.6. Antioxidant Activity The DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical and ABTS (2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethyl- benzothiazoline)-6-sulphonic acid) radical cation scavenging activities were determined, and the results were expressed as Trolox equivalents (TEs/g extract).",b6339304-836a-4725-9d7f-1a2d3a7aca18
7,methods7," The reducing power of the extracts was measured according to the reported method, using cupric ion reducing antioxidant power (CUPRAC) and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)), and results were expressed as Trolox equivalents (TEs/g extract). Total antioxidant capacity was determined using phosphomolybdenum method. Metal chelating activity of the extracts against ferrous ions was also determined, and the results were expressed as EDTA equivalents (EDTAE/g extract). All these antioxidant procedures were performed as previously documented [57].  5.7. Enzyme Inhibitory Activities Enzyme inhibitory activities (acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), tyrosinase, α-amylase and α-glucosidase) of the extracts were determined using the already published methodology [58].",8764f831-c353-496e-8986-622ed7d4a7d4
8,methods8," Results for enzyme inhibitory activities were expressed as standard compound equivalents (galantamine for AChE and BChE, kojic acid for tyrosinase, acarbose for both α-amylase and α-glucosidase).  5.8. Statistical Analysis All the assays were carried out in triplicate. The results are expressed as mean values and standard deviation (SD). The differences between some stages/parts in each location were calculated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s honest significant difference post hoc test with α = 0.05. This treatment was carried out using SPSS v. 14.0 program (SPSS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). ",f88dd206-fa87-474a-a682-8eb47d90871e
