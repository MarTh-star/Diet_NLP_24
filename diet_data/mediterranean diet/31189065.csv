The students were enrolled in different degree programs in the area of health sciences: nursing, physiotherapy, and psychology. For convenience, a non-aleatory sample was used. Participation was voluntary and confidential, and all participants signed an informed consent form. Given the interest of our study in the sub-clinical population, we used any psychological diagnosis and drugs consumption as exclusion criteria. Table 1 provides an analysis of the age of the participants by sex and area of university study.  2.2.

1,methods1,"  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet: the KIDMED test was used, a brief instrument for dietary evaluation providing information on the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) [13]. The test consists of 16 dichotomous questions in which participants must specify if they perform the indicated task. The items aim to assess the intake of food and habits belonging to the Mediterranean diet (fruit, olive oil, cheese, etc.) and the consumption of inadequate food contrary to Mediterranean diet (sweets, ultra-processed, fast food, etc.) The test provides a global score used to obtain an index classifying the participants by poor diet, need to improve dietary habits, and optimum Mediterranean diet, as specified in thedata analysis section. The reliability of this test was verified in a validation test with Spanish children and young people up to 24 years of age [42].",617657ae-1a41-4549-9d08-57a18918c6d2
2,methods2,"  Alcohol consumption: The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT)) was used to determine the alcohol consumption habits of the participants. The questionnaire was created by the World Health Organization to identify persons with high-risk or harmful alcohol consumption habits by means of a simple screening test. The test consists of 10 items, 8 of which are on a Likert scale of 5 categories ordered from 0 (never/1 or 2 units) to 4 (daily/10 or more units). The two remaining items also use a Likert scale but with 3 categories ordered from 0 to 2. The responses from participants allows them to be classified into three levels: without risk of dependence, at risk consumption and probable alcohol dependence syndrome (alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS)) (see cut-off points in data analysis section).",a7823795-2a38-465c-8db3-c0c1c813946b
3,methods3," The recent validation of the test on Spanish university population by García, Novalbos, Martínez and O’Ferrall [43] found the internal consistency of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) test to be α = 0.75. In our sample the internal consistency of the test was α = 0.74.  Anxiety: to measure levels of anxiety we used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)) adapted by Buela-Casal, Guillén-Riquelme and Seisdedos-Cubero [44]. This questionnaire is composed of 40 items which evaluate two different concepts: anxiety as a state (a transitory emotional response) and anxiety as a trait (a constant anxious condition). The 20 items of each subsection use a Likert scale of 4 categories from 0 (almost never) to 3 (very often/almost always). The analysis of psychometric properties of the instrument for university population showed a high internal consistency (α = 0.93) [45]. In our sample, the internal consistency was α = 0.58.",fee18417-7678-4b93-9118-93c99180d3bc
4,methods4,"  Emotional Eater: to evaluate this variable the Emotional Eating Questionnaire was used (Emotional Eating Questionnaire was used (EEQ)) [46], consisting of 10 items on a 4-category Likert scale from 0 (never) to 3 (always). The test consists of 3 subscales which measure the lack of control (disinhibition) in eating, food preferences (with high calory content) and feelings of guilt. Additionally, the test provides a global score to distinguish between the non-emotional eater, the slightly emotional eater, the emotional eater and the highly emotional eater. In this last category there is a risk of developing an eating disorder. The temporal stability shows medium–high correlation in the test-retest average (r = 0.702; p < 0.001) and the internal consistency of the subscales range from α =0.61 to α = 0.77. This indicates the appropriate reliability of the instrument [46]. In our sample, the internal consistency was α = 0.79 and the subscales varied between α = 0.58 and α = 0.73.  2.3.",9df65b69-801c-4775-9123-65d28990267a

The differences in these variables based on sex were analyzed using Student’s t-test and the university degree using a one-way and analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. For the second objective, correlational and predictive, the matrix of correlations between variables was determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient.

8,methods8," Descriptive Analysis of the Degree of Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, Alcohol Consumption, Anxiety, and Emotional Eating The results of the questionnaire regarding adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) show that 20.7% of participants have a poor diet (N = 52), while 63.7% show dietary habits that need improvement (N = 161) and only 15.5% have an optimum Mediterranean diet (N = 39). In analyzing the differences according to sex and degree (Table 2 and Table 3), differences were only found in relation to the degree, although the effect size is low. Specifically, students of physiotherapy showed higher levels of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) than students of nursing and psychology (p = 0.005; p = 0.001, respectively).  Secondly, regarding alcohol consumption it was found that 80% of the sample may be considered as not at risk of developing alcohol dependency (N = 201), 17.6% are at risk of developing alcohol dependency (N = 45) and 2.",3cfd56b6-d50c-4add-9705-81082d5dc3ec

Regarding anxiety, the results show that 25.2% of the sample experience low levels of state-anxiety (N = 63) compared to 51.2% who report moderate (N = 129) and 23.6% who report high levels (N = 60). No differences were found in levels of state-anxiety according to sex but there were differences according to university degree with a low effect size (see Table 2 and Table 3, respectively). Pairwise comparisons show that students of psychology experience higher levels of state-anxiety than nursing or physiotherapy students (p < 0.001).  With regards to trait-anxiety, the percentage of participants with low, medium, and high levels are similar to figures for state-anxiety, 24.8%, 57.5%, and 17.",6ee394b1-dc51-470b-9057-b3ef4946b00d

Differences in this variable were only detected according to studies, as shown in Table 3, specifically, among students of psychology and nursing (p < 0.001).  Finally, regarding emotional eating, the study found that some 28.2% of the sample can be considered as non-emotional eaters (N = 71), some 40.4% are slightly emotional eaters (N = 102), 29% are emotional eaters (N = 73) and 2.4% are highly emotional eaters (N = 6). In analyzing the differences between men and women, statistically significant differences were found in the subscale of guilty and in the global score, where women showed higher figures (see Table 2). The point biserial correlation shows that sex and this variable share 7% variance (RXY = 0.268; RXY2 = 0.071) for the subscale of guilty and 3% for the global score (RXY = 0.189; RXY2 = 0.035), that is, a low effect size.",fc894dee-59a5-4033-be9b-d9e9ef71f406

To obtain predictive models for the different subscales of Emotional Eater, adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) and alcohol consumption, anxiety (state and trait), sex, and age were included as independent variables. For all of these, multiple linear regressions were made using forward selection.  For the subscale of food preference, state-anxiety proved to be the only predictive variable (β = 0.037; p < 0.001), which explains 13% of the variance in the response variable (F = 40.099; p < 0.001). State-anxiety was also the only predictive variable in the subscale disinhibition (β = 0.092; p < 0.001), explaining 12% of the variance (F = 36.931; p < 0.001). On the contrary, for the subscale guilt, in addition to state-anxiety (β = 0.029; p = 0.001), the variables of sex (β = 0.1.004; p < 0.001) which resulted the most predictive variable.",9b9ea783-1bf9-47d7-a092-d7e612331467

Sex and state-anxiety results were also predictive of a global score of the Emotional Eating Questionnaire was used (EEQ), but in this case, the anxiety was a greater predictive variable (β = 0.156; p < 0.001) instead of sex (β = 1.858; p = 0.004). The model was statistically significant (F = 30.223; p < 0.001) and explains 19% of the variance in the variable.  As for the predictive model for adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), only trait-anxiety was a predictive variable (β = 0.089; p = 0.017), explaining 1.9% of the variance in the variable (F = 5.749; p = 0.017). By contrast, for alcohol consumption, no entered variable was a significant predictor.

Discussion For the first objective of the study, an evaluation was made of the eating habits, alcohol consumption, degrees of emotional eating, and anxiety (state/trait) among the students. With regards to students’ eating habits, the KIDMED index measuring adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) shows that a large proportion of participants have a poor diet (20.7%) or have eating habits that need improvement (63.7%). These values are similar to those found in previous studies carried out among university Spanish students in Madrid, Navarra, and Granada [5,11,14,47,48]. Some authors have pointed to a clear trend among Spanish young people in abandoning the Mediterranean diet and lifestyle [49]. Physiotherapy students showed higher levels of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) than nursing or psychology students.",72af0dcc-3756-42b1-ab8c-c0a11e482840
15,methods15," This may be related to the higher levels of physical activity of physiotherapy students: studies of Spanish university students indicate that adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) is higher among those who are more physically active and less sedentary [11,14,50]. No significant differences were found according to sex, in line with the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) results of KIDMED testing among large samples of Spanish young people [13,42].  The physical and cognitive benefits of the Mediterranean diet have been demonstrated among countries of the Mediterranean basin including Spain [10,11,15,47,51]. It is, therefore, proper to promote adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) among the general public and particularly among future health professionals, such as students of nursing, physiotherapy, and psychology, through information and education programs, some of which have demonstrated their effectiveness [47].",3065411e-e5f0-4159-a31e-3908b9123df8
16,methods16,"  Regarding alcohol consumption, some 80% of participants can be considered as not at risk of problematic alcohol consumption, although 17.6% show results that indicate a risk of dependency and 2.4% can be considered as having alcohol dependency syndrome (alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS)). These results, while worrying, are not as alarming as those found in previous research which show higher rates of alcohol consumption among university students and a higher percentage of participants with alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS) [8,52,53], which is in line with the findings of the Encuesta Nacional sobre Drogas (National Drug Survey) [54], which points to a fall in alcohol consumption among secondary students in recent years. It has been proposed that alcohol use may be sensitive to contextual factors, suggesting that drinking behavior depends on the time spent in the university: the longer the period a student spends in the university, the higher his/her risk of drinking [19].",02883399-ef75-44e6-91d8-feee34083daf
17,methods17," It is possible that, nowadays, college students generally spend a shorter period at university, due to the use of online platforms for many activities and virtual class attendance on the internet.  No differences were detected in the consumption of alcohol between men and women, which confirms that alcohol consumption can no longer be largely associated with men, as previous studies have shown, and is now equally prevalent in both sexes [18,55,56,57]. Neither were any differences found in the consumption of alcohol according to area of study, which seems to indicate that, among students of degrees within the field of health sciences, the choice of future profession has no bearing on alcohol consumption. In fact, no research has found differences in alcohol consumption among students of different degrees, nor differences between degrees in the field of health sciences, which points to possible avenues for future research.",d8f1934a-53f8-4dee-9f47-001218afa990
18,methods18," Perhaps this is another explanation for the lower rates of alcohol consumption found in this study in comparison with previous research about alcohol consumption among university students: all participants were enrolled in health science courses, and are possibly more aware of health issues.  The findings related to anxiety show that some 25.2% of participants experience low levels of state-anxiety, as opposed to 51.2% who reported moderate or 23.6% who reported high levels of state-anxiety; with regards to trait-anxiety, the percentage of participants showing low, moderate, and high levels are similar to the figures for state-anxiety (24.8%, 57.5%, and 17.7%, respectively). The fact that over half the sample show moderate levels of anxiety, both state and trait, is in line with other studies which have found higher levels of anxiety among university students compared to the general population [30].",4ddecce6-7d29-49b1-b227-24a365e935e3
19,methods19," No significant differences were found between men and women for these two measures of anxiety, but differences were found in terms of university degree: students of psychology experience higher levels of anxiety (both state and trait). Previous studies have detected generally higher levels of anxiety among students of health sciences, such as medicine [58] or nursing [59], but no studies have been found which compare the different degrees in relation to anxiety. Identifying degrees (as in this case, psychology) where students show higher levels of anxiety can help develop and implement effective coping strategies for stress, often associated with academic demands [31,32]. High anxiety can lead to physical, emotional, and mental health problems, and has also been associated with lower academic performance [60].  In relation to emotional eating, the study shows that 28.2% of the sample can be classified as non-emotional eaters, some 40.",d9e11e75-1590-4eab-8d7f-0df5dffb1139
20,methods20,"4% as slightly emotional eaters, 29% as emotional eaters and 2.4% as highly emotional eaters. These results show that almost a third of participants exhibit this pattern of eating behavior with a certain frequency. Some authors have related this type of eating behavior with feelings of anxiety [26], while others argue that boredom is a more significant factor than anxiety or depression [25]. An analysis of the differences between men and women in the various subscales shows differences only in the subscale of guilt, where women score higher. Studies analyzing sex differences with regard to emotional eating have found certain differences: among men, emotional eating is associated principally with symptoms of depression, while in women it is principally linked to feelings of anxiety [27]. It would appear that the mechanisms of emotional eating among men and women are different and further study is needed into the factors triggering emotional eating among men and women.",175465e8-28db-485a-b986-e412952b5a73
21,methods21," Regarding the differences found in terms of area of study, findings show that psychology students experience higher levels of anxiety compared to other degrees, and also score above average in the subscale of food preferences.  Regarding the second objective, relating levels of anxiety to adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), emotional eating, and alcohol consumption, some interesting connections have been found. Levels of state-anxiety reveal a direct linear relation with all subscales of the emotional eating questionnaire (disinhibition, food preferences and guilt), while trait-anxiety is related only to the subscales of disinhibition and food preferences. This is coherent with findings of previous studies which have related the increase in emotional eating with anxiety and stress [61].",ec0d01a9-b2a2-42fa-8a25-bda03ea4eb1d
22,methods22," Additionally, the relationship between anxiety and increased intake of high-calory foods as a coping strategy [22] can alter the cerebral reward system, particularly at a stage of life coinciding with the end of the cerebral maturation period [62], with significant long-term repercussions as the intake of unhealthy food can become an important reinforcer [23]. Regarding the difference between state anxiety and trait anxiety, a recent study of adult women showed a linear relationship between emotional eating and anxiety, particularly for trait anxiety [63]. More study is needed into the relationship between anxiety and eating behavior. In this study both state-anxiety and trait-anxiety are related to disinhibition and food preferences, but only state-anxiety is related to guilt. State-anxiety is more associated with specific external situations and is more susceptible to change than trait anxiety, by changing stressful contextual factors or implementing appropriate coping strategies.",9938bc9c-9133-4e52-a41f-f9a972f838af
23,methods23," It is important to take these differences into account when designing prevention/intervention strategies and profiles of unhealthy eating habits.  Although poor eating habits have long been associated with alcohol consumption among university students [64,65], the present study found no relation between the level of alcohol consumption and the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD). However, these results are coherent with the notion that both poor eating habits are coping strategies, normally exclusive, adopted by university students in situation of stress [37]. This points to the need for university students to improve their coping strategies in favor of more active and effective strategies. With regard to emotional eating, a relationship was found only between the subscales of guilty and alcohol consumption.",4bead12e-3629-482b-92e2-7fec76645f7e
24,methods24," The propensity for feelings of guilty (in general and not only in relation to specific eating habits) has been associated with substance addition [66], including alcohol abuse [67].  Finally, the study found a direct relationship between the level of trait anxiety and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD). An obsession with healthy eating has been associated with personality disorders, low self-esteem, and anxiety problems [68,69], which may partly explain these results. It has been found that a direct relationship exists between obsessive preoccupation with healthy food and perfectionism [70], and anxiety seems to be a mediator of the relationship between perfectionism and eating disorders [71].",81c7a9b6-cf11-4b93-843c-afc6d103eb81
25,methods25,"  Regarding the third objective of the study, to determine which factors (sex, age, and anxiety levels) are predictive of alcohol consumption, emotional eating and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), state-anxiety proved to be the most predictive for the subscale of food preferences and disinhibition on the questionnaire of emotional eating. As mentioned above, increased intake of high-calory food has been identified as a coping strategy for anxiety [22] and the relationship between anxiety and disinhibition has been established in many studies dealing with problematic eating habits, although from a clinical perspective [72,73]. It would be interesting to determine if difficulties in impulse control associated with emotional eating and immediate gratification, which ignore long-term negative consequences, only occur in the context of diet, and not in other scenarios such internet use (gaming or social media), or in everyday contexts.",1bdd2a5d-e424-4352-8b7f-2fffadfa778d
26,methods26," For the subscale of guilt, in addition to state-anxiety, other variables such as sex (women) play a part. In this sense, social pressure suffered by women to achieve a canon of beauty can be an explanation to the sense of guilt after emotional eating. For adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), only trait-anxiety was a predictor. Further studies are needed in order to deepen how personality traits or stable behavior patterns contribute to adhere to healthier eating habits. Thus, understanding the function of adaptative or maladaptive eating and drinking behaviors may result in a more effective intervention [74,75].  These findings could enable the design and implementation of educational programs to promote healthy habits among university students. It is important that future healthcare professionals’ value and adopt healthy habits and lifestyles given that they will be those primarily responsible for encouraging healthy habits and risk prevention among their patients.",10e61b47-c30f-4973-b943-913cbc03989f
27,methods27," In this sense, it seems important to control anxiety levels of the students, particularly state-anxiety levels, for the adoption of unhealthy habits. It is relevant to teach students how to manage with stressful situations and how to implement coping strategies.  This study has several limitations. Firstly, the participants were only from psychology, nursing, and physiotherapy courses, and it would be interesting to count with students from all the degrees of healthcare professions. A more representative sample should be required, as in other studies that partially investigate some of us associations and longitudinal studies are needed.  Secondly, it would be important to compare the results found with those obtained with students from degrees with no relationship with healthcare.",e9d75770-591a-4165-a32f-1dcb8f63f6e1
28,methods28," Thirdly, it would be interesting to know the grams of alcohol intake on the participants ad correlated with Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), anxiety, and emotional eating. And finally, the adaptability of the instruments must be improved, and it would have been desirable to include other psychological variables such as depression, which has also shown high prevalence among college population [32]. Further studies in this topic are needed.  Previous work on this area suggests the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) and quality of life and others the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) and the wellbeing of Spanish college students [76]. Positive associations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD) adherence and higher levels of subjective happiness have been found in adolescents [77].",cdfc422c-1357-4da6-8445-e77b87620f66
29,methods29," Furthermore, several studies have suggested the effects of a dietary intervention on mental health: a systematic review found improvements in depression scores in eight of the seventeen studies reviewed, and in two of the ten studies that measured anxiety, when compared with a control group [78]. The importance of diet in mental health, and not just physical health, seems indisputable. However, an important aspect of the current study needs to be highlighted: the first approach to the study of the relationships between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (AMD), emotional eating, alcohol intake, and anxiety, which can contribute to the start of a line of research that can be fruitful in health care.  5.

No differences were detected between men and women.
