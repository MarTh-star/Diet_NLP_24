0,methods0," Participants  We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 250 patients aged 18–65 who had recovered from COVID-19. Using a convenience sampling method, participants were drawn from Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Kashan, Iran. This research was conducted between June and September 2021. The Kashan University of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee reviewed and approved the study's protocol (Registration No. IR.KAUMS.MEDNT.REC.1400.048). Informed consent was obtained from study participants prior to enrollment in the study.  At first, we examined the medical records of 600 COVID-19 patients with available medical data from Shahid Beheshti Hospital who had been diagnosed within the previous 3 months were included.",82c8e4b6-48b2-4edc-999a-5801814c680c
1,methods1," We excluded 350 patients after considering the following items as the exclusion criteria: any comorbidities or diseases other than COVID-19, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or diseases that affect COVID-19 severity; a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) >40 kg/m2; current pregnancy or breastfeeding; active smoking; consuming dietary supplements more than twice a week prior to the COVID-19 diagnosis; being on any special diets; taking any medications that affect respiratory tract function, such as fluticasone, flunisolide, and so on; and incomplete medical records. In addition, all enrolled patients were not vaccinated because public vaccination had not yet begun in Iran at the time of the study.  Assessment of Dietary Intakes  Dietary intakes were assessed using a web-based 168-item food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) to collect data on dietary intakes of participants during a year preceding their COVID-19 diagnosis.",7a30d03e-0a9d-4100-a7db-99f90ff8bd16
2,methods2," The reliability and validity of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) have previously been evaluated (29). We utilized the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to assess dietary intakes because the patients in this study were hospitalized and their diets may have changed due to the disease and its consequences. This questionnaire allowed participants to report their dietary intakes daily, monthly, or annually. Then, using 'household measures,' the dietary intakes were converted to grams per day (g/d). Nutritionist IV software was used to calculate the dietary intakes of micronutrients and macronutrients.  Adherence to the MD was used following the method introduced by Trichopoulou et al. (30). The adherence was quantitated by calculating the MD score.",08e88f4c-954a-4060-be3b-fa1f95d61462
3,methods3," To accomplish this, nine components were taken into account: vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, fish, whole grains, the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) to saturated fatty acids (SFAs), meats (red meat, poultry, and processed meats), and dairy. Participants who were above the median intakes of vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, fish, whole grains, and the highest MUFA to SFA ratio and those who were below the median intakes of meats and dairy received a score of 1. In contrast, individuals at the top median intakes of meat and dairy products as well as those at the bottom median intakes of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, and legumes received a score of 0. These scores were summed up to calculate the overall MD score.  Measurement of COVID-19 Severity  The severity of COVID-19 was described and classified using the National Institute of Health's Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelines, updated on October 19, 2021 (31).",f12aca24-7f2a-4973-bc5a-d9179b2b2608
4,methods4," This guideline defines patients with severe illness as those who have SpO2 <94% on room air at sea level, arterial partial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) >30 breaths/min, or lung infiltrates >50%), and a cluster of respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction.  Measurement of COVID-19 Symptoms  Patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire including questions about the presence of common COVID-19 manifestations, i.e., fever, chilling, dyspnea, cough, weakness, muscle pain, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting.  Assessment of Inflammatory Markers  The first available measures of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) were obtained from medical records during patients' hospitalization.",f7722850-c177-4b8a-a3f4-aa5e690436fe
5,methods5,"  Assessment of Other Variables  A general questionnaire was used to collect information about each patient's demographics, physical activity, convalescence duration, administration of supplement, corticosteroid, and antiviral drug intake, and participants' height and weight.  Statistical Analysis  We divided participants into tertile groups based on their MD score. To determine normality, we used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Means and standard deviations for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables were reported to describe the general characteristics of participants across tertiles of MD score. The general characteristics of study participants were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous and chi-square tests for quantitative variables across tertiles of MD score.",0019ec30-313a-49c3-88b8-1423215aa52d
6,methods6," The inflammatory biomarkers were compared using covariance analysis (ANCOVA) across the MD score tertiles, after adjustment for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity. The association between the MD score and severe COVID-19, as well as its symptoms was assessed using binary logistic regression in multiple models. At the first model findings were adjusted for age (continuous), gender (male/female), and energy intake/basal metabolic rate (BMR) (continuous). In the second model, additional adjustments were made for (sedentary/moderate/intense), supplementation (yes/no), corticosteroid use (yes/no), and antiviral medication use (yes/no). In the third model, there was an additional adjustment for the body mass index (BMI) (continuous). The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., version 25) was used in the current study. Statistical significance was defined as P-values <0.05. ",38c4fff9-fdc3-494b-8b64-69f7c3cec6df

Table 2 depicts dietary intakes of selected food groups and nutrients across tertiles of the MD score.

These participants also had lower daily energy, fat, SFAs, MUFAs, vitamin B3, and vitamin D intakes. It is worth noting that those at the highest tertile of the MD score significantly consumed more fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and fish and lower meats than those at the.",a0ee5374-c179-481c-9e58-b2f352e1f259
8,results4,"  Table 3 illustrates serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers across the MD score tertiles. After controlling for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity, participants in the top tertile had significantly lower C reactive protein (CRP) (7.80 ± 1.87 vs. 37.36 ± 2.05 mg/l) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (14.08 ± 2.17 vs. 42.65 ± 2.37 mm/hr.) than those in the bottom tertile (P < 0.001).

9,results5,"  Crude and multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for severe COVID-19 according to tertiles of MD score are presented in Table 4. Patients in the top tertile of the MD score had lower odds of having severe COVID-19 than patients in the bottom tertile, in the crude model (OR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.30, P < 0.001). After controlling for potential confounding factors, participants with the highest MD score were 84% less likely to have severe COVID-19 than those with the lowest score (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.32, P < 0.001). Additional adjustment for body mass index (BMI) attenuated, but did not eliminate, the association (OR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.50, P < 0.001). When the analyses were done individually based on body mass index (BMI) status, surprisingly the association was significant only among overweight or obese patients; implying an 86% decreased probability of having severe COVID-19 (OR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.36, P < 0.001).",20f296e1-1d26-4712-b5cd-8259eeb0ceae
10,discussion0," This study found an inverse association between a higher MD score and odds of having severe COVID-19 as well as a shorter duration of hospitalization and convalescence. Even though there was little difference in total energy intake among the participants, those in the upper tertile of MD scores had significantly lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as C reactive protein (CRP) (7.80 ± 1.87 vs. 37.36 ± 2.05 mg/l) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (14.08 ± 2.17 vs. 42.65 ± 2.37) than those in the lowest tertile. Both C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are widely used as systemic inflammatory biomarkers (32). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may reveal the presence of inflammation in the body because it measures the rate at which red blood cells drop or settle in the plasma of a randomly selected anticoagulated blood sample, and inflammation can result in cell clumping (32).",475ac812-ed36-471d-9bfe-a41bef8e1c76
11,discussion1," On the other hand, C reactive protein (CRP) is an unspecific acute-phase reactant that is produced and synthesized in the liver in response to a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines (32).  Taking this comparison into account, those in the upper tertile of the MD consumed more protein, carbohydrates, fiber, n-3 fatty acids, vitamin B complex (B1, B2, B6, B12, folate), calcium, potassium, and magnesium, while consuming less total fat, primarily saturated fat. This is an expected result, as individuals with the highest MD scores consumed significantly more fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish, and lean meats, all of which contain functional elements that may help mitigate COVID-related inflammation. COVID-19 causes a cytokine storm (e.g., interferon-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and transforming growth factor-β, a central tenet that exacerbates the severity of COVID-19 (33).",ec00a5bb-5b2c-4015-a46b-51458e1b1e54
12,discussion2," RCTs demonstrated the beneficial effects of the MD on the inflammatory status and primary events. In an RCT involving 372 participants over 3 months, adequate consumption of cereals and fruits, combined with a higher intake of nuts and olive oil, was associated with lower levels of IL-6, C reactive protein (CRP), and other inflammatory biomarkers such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (34, 35). Most importantly, the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED)) trial, a multicenter study involving 7,447 patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, demonstrated that the MD has long-term benefits by reducing the incidence of major cardiovascular events compared to a low-fat diet after a mean follow-up of 5 years (36–40).",3705a6ca-7671-4940-a4c6-486690a3013e
13,discussion3," Concerning polyphenols, a sub-study of the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) trial involving 1,170 elderly participants showed a significant inverse association between polyphenol intake as measured by the urinary biomarker total polyphenol excretion and inflammatory markers, with a significant decrease in plasma concentrations of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (41). The favorable effects of the MD pattern on platelet-activating factor-induced platelet aggregation is another potential against COVID-19, as the platelet-activating factor is a critical molecule in the pathogenesis of this ailment (42). The phytochemical mixture across the MD diet may be more efficient than individual food substances (43). Indeed, complex natural products target many facets involved in inflammation and thrombosis in a synergistic manner (43–45).",d9541519-12a7-4d74-8a55-003a3cb59724
14,discussion4,"  Apart from increased intake of functional nutrients, the lower intake of saturated fatty acids observed in the upper tertile of the MD score may contribute to a less inflammatory state, as this type of fat stimulates the production of C reactive protein (CRP) and TNF-α, as well as signaling pathways involving toll-like receptor-4 (46, 47). In light of this, replacing SFAs with the increase in MUFAs or PUFA found in nuts is a strong recommendation (47–50). In our study, the upper tertiles of the MD score not only had a lower intake of saturated fat but also MUFA consumption, which is an odd result given that the MD is high in MUFA due to the high consumption of olive oil. Nonetheless, this result is explicable by the fact that this research was conducted in Iran, a country whose population consumes a significant amount of nuts, primarily walnuts, which are a recognized source of PUFA (51–53).",2b588981-5bc3-4421-b232-0552ea62e679
15,discussion5," The consumption of nuts by participants in the upper tertile of the MD score was within the range associated with a sustained decline in low-grade inflammation. For example, acute and chronic studies demonstrated that nut consumption of between 20 and 90 g/day might reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and improves associated outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular parameters and visceral fat) (54–56). Much of these benefits can be explained by high content of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals such as selenium and alpha-tocopherol across nuts (57).  Strengths and Limitations  As for strengths, this study shed lights on a nutritional strategy that could be used in place of isolate supplements in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a result is significant when considering the global population. On the other hand, because our study was conducted on a single population (Iranians), we encourage additional multicenter research to confirm our findings.",85ba65c5-d3ad-4a43-afeb-401676dcb165
16,discussion6," Due to the cross-sectional design of this study, which is a common limitation in nutrition and medical research, this study cannot infer causation, and thus recommendations cannot be affirmed. Despite extensive adjustment for potential confounding variables, the possibility of residual confounding cannot be completely ruled out. It should be noted that the sample size and all participants were drawn from a single-center, so generalizability to the general public should be approached with caution. Additionally, the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s rely on interviewees' memory, and despite our efforts to accurately measure their estimated nutrient intake over a year in grams, the memory bias inherent in this type of questionnaire cannot be ignored, particularly in relation to overweight and obese individuals, who are more likely to underreport their energy intake (58).",6095c90a-81ab-4ee2-98b0-802bedfba6b2
17,discussion7," To overcome this, we controlled for the proportion of energy intake to basal metabolic rate (basal metabolic rate (BMR)) in the analyses, which was calculated using Schofield equation (59). MD score calculation method is limited as it is based on the relationship between each participant's food consumption and depends on whether or not the population has a high or low rate of adherence to the MD. This study examined the effect of a dietary pattern on COVID-19 in a population with no pre-existing conditions and a low-risk profile (such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, morbid obesity). Those who are at greater risk may experience a different response to the dietary items. Therefore, it would be prudent for future research to evaluate high-risk groups. We have no specific information on the type of dietary supplements consumed, hence we evaluate them all in a similar way. We also did not assess hospital nutrition or nutritional risk.",ce1241d3-1410-4120-9368-c96131228dbe
18,discussion8," To the extent that recent research shows that customized hospital diets have been used for COVID-19 patients (60), this merits further attention.  Finally, we did not assess a robust laboratory panel for the inflammatory status, such as the whole inflammatory signaling cascade of C reactive protein (CRP), which includes at least IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α (61). Insufficient data on the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), monoclonal antibodies, IL-6 inhibitors, and blood pressure medications was another limitation. Furthermore, we did not assess the level of antioxidants and polyphenols in urine or blood. Therefore, additional research is necessary to better understand the metabolic pathways involved in this process.",28515948-e261-4ccf-83ea-2b2814184eaf
19,discussion9,"  Conclusion  Following a MD pattern can result in a favorable profile against COVID-19, as we observed that a higher MD score was associated with shorter length of hospital stay, convalescence, symptoms, as well as reduced severity and inflammatory status (low C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels) in patients with COVID-19. However, RCTs are necessary in order to provide recommendations for any population.
