0,methods0," 2.1. Google Trends  Google Trends (https://trends.google.com/trends/ accessed on 11 July 2022) is an online and free tool provided by Google that measures search interest in a particular topic or a set of search terms. It is anonymized, categorized (determining the topic for a search query), and aggregated (grouped into topics). Google Trends data can be accessed in non-real time and go as far back as 2004 and up to 72 h before you search. The data are indexed and normalized, which means the numbers are scaled on a range of 0 to 100, where each data point on the graph represents the proportion of a search topic, as a search term, of total searches in a given country or worldwide during the time period selected. A value of Relative Search Volume (Relative Search Volume (RSV)) of 100 is the maximum search interest for the period and location selected. Searches with low volume, duplicate searches, and special characters are excluded from search.",b531ae61-b576-4a96-aa96-8c007bcc0ffe
1,methods1,"  Google trends may qualify analyzed phrases as “search term” or “topic”. Search terms are literally typed words, whereas topics may be proposed by Google Trends when the tool recognizes phrases related to popular queries. Topics enable easy comparison of the given term between countries. For example, the search term “London” will be analyzed by Google Trends exactly; thus, Relative Search Volume (RSV) will be the highest in English-speaking countries, whereas the topic “London” will include all queries associated with the query in all the available languages, for example, “Capital of the United Kingdom” and “Londres”, which is “London” in Portuguese and Spanish [30].  It is important to note that none of the searches in the Google database for this study can be associated with a particular individual. The database does not retain information about the identity, IP address, or specific physical location of any user.",3f9bc5d7-2289-4fd1-90b1-10ac701a2311
2,methods2,"  Google accounts for >80% of global search engine use [35], and Google Trends is one of the few open sources of search query data. Google Trends is considered a valid and robust indicator to track interest, attention, and public opinion over time [36,37] and has increasingly been used to quantify trends in public interest in several fields such as health care [32,33], tourism [38], and economics [39,40]. The strengths and advantages of Google trends are evident; nevertheless, this tool also presents limitations. Due to time and geographical normalization, we can only compare relative popularity, meaning that different regions that show the same Relative Search Volume (RSV) for a term will not always have the same total search volumes. Another limitation to the use of Google Trends is the fact that not everyone uses the Internet, and Internet use may be higher in younger people; therefore, Google Trends data may not be fully representative and may present a selection bias [41,42].  2.2.",ce1682d3-3aff-41f3-9524-814c7c53d5f9

We used two different approaches: (1) one consisting of the Sustainability, Healthy Diet, “Flexitarianism” (FlexDiet) and “Mediterranean Diet” (MedDiet) topics, and (2) another being a combination of search terms related with “Food Sustainability” (“Food Sustainability” + “sustainable diet” + “sustainable food”). The search term combinations are listed in Table 1 in the official language of each country.

Discussion  In this study, we explored, for the first time, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the public’s interest in Food Sustainability, in Sustainability, and in dietary patterns, namely the Healthy Diet, FlexDiet, and MedDiet, using Big Data. Specifically, we used the Relative Search Volume (RSV)s provided by Google Trends to obtain temporal series of public interest in the mentioned topics before the COVID-19 pandemic and to forecast public interest after it.",f63efe2d-8ce5-40de-83f7-e0615a77f9aa
20,methods21," By comparing the predicted and observed values, an image of how this global health event affected public interest in Food Sustainability, in Sustainability, and in dietary patterns, was obtained. Using this strategy, an increase in Food Sustainability public interest after the COVID-19 outbreak was observed, and this increase was higher than what was forecast based on the previous data. A significant increase in interest in Sustainability in general was also observed; nevertheless, this increase was smaller than that forecast by our models. Taken together, these results may indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak sparked an interest in Food Sustainability while reducing the increase in interest in general Sustainability.",45c978bc-5b26-4d76-a7d9-65e63e6bef7a
21,methods22," Furthermore, mixed results regarding dietary patterns were obtained across European regions; yet, considering the mean interest for Europe, it seems that the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak dampened the interest in dietary patterns such as the Healthy Diet and FlexDiet, and promoted interest in the MedDiet, at least in the western European region.  4.1. Changes in Food Sustainability Interest after COVID-19  The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the functioning of food systems all over the world and, despite its stability, Europe has been no exception. The pandemic outbreak caused problems in the operations of all the food system’s players, including the actors providing the means of food production, the food producers, the logistics and processing industry and, inevitably, this turbulence went all the way to consumers. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the food system directly and indirectly; for instance, COVID-19 disrupted food supply transportation (e.g.",701adee6-5ec9-4b76-ae6e-ea8b995ff4b4
22,methods23,", access to container transport) and changed the demands for related services (such as retail food pickup and delivery services) [43]. Incidents of food flow disruption due to the pandemic were largely highlighted by the media and varied from vegetables rotting in fields and milk being dumped, to food processing facilities running short of workers due to the disease, and panic buying in stores. Strains on multiple points of the food supply chain could affect food availability and prices in the retail sector, ultimately impacting people at the receiving end [44,45]. Our results indicate that public interest in Food Sustainability increased after the COVID-19 outbreak to a higher degree than would be expected considering the tendencies of previous years. A possible explanation may reside in the perfect storm that assaulted the food system during the pandemic and the media coverage of those problems that may have led consumers to seek information on food sustainability and security.",eae5eb1c-ee90-4a13-860d-cadce46c1fd9
23,methods24,"  Few studies have explored the adoption of sustainable food behaviors and attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Muresan et al. [46] explored consumers’ attitudes towards sustainable food consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania and found a positive attitude towards sustainable food behavior. Despite the positive attitude towards sustainable food behavior, as observed in previous works [47,48], a gap between attitudes and actual behaviors was observed. The authors also noted that respondents supported local producers, were aware of the importance of domestic agriculture, and were concerned about their health and waste reduction when planning a food menu; however, they also noted that even if the respondents’ perception of the sustainable food choices was positive, their purchasing behavior was very different when it came to buying local products or supporting third-world farmers.",935cbc41-79ac-427e-bed6-d5998411aab3
24,methods25," Possible explanations were put forward, such as the higher prices of local foods compared to prices in supermarket chains or simply the fact that Romanian consumers are not ready to change their consumption patterns, as part of a complex and long process (51). For the most part, human behavior is the force of habits determined by cultural, social, and economic factors. Habits are forged in the process of repeating the same responses in particular contexts. Dietary choices are made virtually every day, driven by habitual response, and are extremely stable [49]. However, when the components that make up our environment or circumstances change, our food choice habits may change as well [50]. Therefore, it is possible that the pandemic period, which patently constitutes a disruption to habitual circumstances, could provoke dietary habit changes [49].  4.2. COVID-19 Impact on Sustainability Interest  Muresan et al.",3beb1653-fa8c-46ca-af00-2767d2243977
25,methods26," [46] also reported that respondents remained neutral towards the environmental issue, without any interest in participating in protection actions, with their actual behavior being limited to recycling food packaging. Along the same lines, Rousseau and Deschacht [51], by analyzing online search behavior in twenty European countries regarding how public awareness of nature and the environment has evolved during the COVID-19 crisis, found that public awareness of environmental issues such as climate change was unaffected by the COVID-19 crisis based on online searches. Our results are along the same lines; despite significantly higher levels of interest in Sustainability after COVID-19, the increase was smaller than would be expected if the pre-COVID-19 conditions were maintained.",afb26c18-3db6-4304-af7d-e078f9970b50
26,methods27," A possible explanation may reside in the perception that the general increasing sense of urgency observed in the last few years for many environmental problems may have been counteracted by the reduction in media attention and the short-term positive trends reported for several pollution levels [51].  4.3. COVID-19 Impact on Dietary Pattern Interest  Surprisingly, public interest in the Healthy Diet and FlexDiet decreased after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. These results are unexpected, since health is one of the main concerns that consumers have in mind when making food choices, especially during COVID-19 times [52]. No studies were found regarding the adherence to healthy or flexitarian dietary patterns, yet one study reported an increase in meat consumption after the pandemic outbreak [53]. Furthermore, reports from gray literature indicate a decline in the number of flexitarians in the United Kingdom [54].",e96db2c4-7515-4294-bc06-b4cd50eca59f
27,methods28," We also observed an increase in the public interest in the MedDiet that was greater than would be expected. In agreement with our results, Della Valle and collaborators [55] found evidence suggesting that adherence to the MedDiet during lockdown might have increased in some settings, while the determinants of such a trend are to be further explored.  No data are available regarding the media coverage of dietary patterns before and/or after the COVID-19 outbreak. However, it is possible that the large media attention directed to COVID-19 may have diverted public attention away from dietary-related issues. It is also likely that media coverage on dietary issues varies across European regions and that, along with many other factors, may explain the inconsistent results obtained across European regions.  4.4.",dfe92544-09bc-4c4a-9250-9c82e4d728df
28,methods29," Strengths and Limitations  Despite the wide use of Google trends to assess public interest in several fields, no research was found regarding Food Sustainability and/or sustainable diets. The assessment of the sustainability of diets is a topic that has received a sizable amount of research attention in recent years. Most of the research conducted in that field has been performed since 2006 [56]. Consumers are relevant players, shaping food systems [22,57,58], and while the academic interest in this topic is clear, public/consumer interest seems to be overlooked [59].  The novelty of this work is a strength, yet some limitations must be acknowledged. Google Trends is considered a valid and robust indicator to track interest, attention, and public opinion over time [36,37]. Nevertheless, Google Trends is not transparent regarding what content is included in each topic. It is possible that the content included in a topic, despite being related, may not be the most obvious.",7e357244-16e1-41fb-8fa7-c83b1ecd7867
29,methods30," For instance, it is reasonable to assume that searches related to the history or the economy of the MedDiet are included in the MedDiet topic. Despite being related, those searches are not relevant to the MedDiet as a dietary pattern. Furthermore, while the topics of MedDiet and Flexitarianism cover well-defined and recognizable diets, the topic of Healthy Diet may include a broad range of diets, including MedDiet and Flexitarianism. A strict interpretation of the topics used in this study as dietary patterns should be made with caution and considering they are a proxy measure.  5. Conclusions  This work explored, for the first time, changes in consumer interest in Food Sustainability, Sustainability, and healthy dietary patterns in Europe induced by COVID-19. Across the counties analyzed, public interest in Food Sustainability increased as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, and this increase was not the result of a general increase in public interest in Sustainability.",2539dd23-2ece-4e18-833d-25c58c4c4cff
30,methods31," Also, public interest in healthy dietary patterns was reduced or only regionally increased.  Understanding consumers’ behavior and interest toward food choices is crucial for the transition to sustainable diets, and to the definition of the educational and behavioral interventions that are essential to this transition [60]. Engagement, interest, and information seeking are also essential for the construction of beliefs and behaviors. More research is needed in this field; nevertheless, these findings may be important for policy makers to design and select strategies that may promote a transition to a sustainable food system supported by healthy dietary patterns.
