0,methods0," 2.1. Cultural Practices and Experimental Treatments  Field trials were carried out during 2020 and 2021, on a chicory plant (cv. Choice), at an experimental field site in Baranello (Molise Region, Italy, latitude 41°31′ N, longitude 14°33′ E, altitude 630 m a.s.l.). The experimental field soil had a uniform profile, with an organic matter content of 1.5% and a clay-sand texture. It contained 0.12% of total N (nitrogen), 20.5 µg/g of available P (phosphorous), 139 µg/g of exchangeable K (potassium), and very low active CaCO3. The pH was, on average, neutral and the salinity was low. The previous crop was Phaseolus vulgaris L. Moderate drought was imposed through rainfed conditions for 50 days. Rainfed (R) and well-watered (W) plants were compared following a randomized block design with five replications (3 m2 each plot). Sowing was carried out manually, placing seeds at a 0.5 cm depth and spacing the rows at 45 cm. Thinning was made to a plant population of 100 plants/m2.",71a1228c-d472-43d0-8505-7372f9e8c297
1,methods1," After sowing, in order to ensure a uniform crop establishment, the same irrigation amount was applied to all fields, by applying a drip irrigation system on every row. Whenever evapotranspiration (ET) reached 25 mm, water restorations occurred. The Penman–Monteith formula was used to calculate ET, from micrometeorological data [16]. At the beginning of the second growing season (25 April), the plants were cut to 30 mm above the potting media level and rainfed conditions were imposed. The first defoliation occurred on the 24 May 2021, 30 days after treatment (30 days after treatment (DAT)), when plants showed at least seven fully developed leaves, and was made manually. The second defoliation occurred on the 15 June 2021 (50 days after treatment (DAT)), in the same manner as the first. All plots were treated with the recommended fertilizer rates of the area, 70 kg/ha of P2O5 and 80 kg/ha of K2O at seedbed preparation and 100 kg/ha of N applied in two splits.",f98f3d35-0926-4b7c-aeb2-4bdd10677927
2,methods2," The first split (60% of total N rate) was basally added to the soil the sowing day, while the second split (40% of total N rate) was supplied at the beginning of the next growing season. To allow for uniform growing conditions, a buffer strip surrounded the field. The weather data (temperature and rainfall) were taken from a meteorological station situated near the experimental field (Table 1).  2.2. Leaf Traits and Gas-Exchange Measurements  Between May and June of the second year (at 30, 37, 43, and 50 days after treatment (DAT)), eight leaf gas-exchange measurements were performed, before the flowering stage, using a portable infrared gas analyzer (Li-6400; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Leaf photosynthetic capacity (Pn), stomatal (gs), and mesophyll conductance (gm) were calculated, as in Delfine, Loreto, Pinelli, Tognetti, and Alvito [36]. The leaf gas exchange data were measured to the fully expanded leaves until 11.30 a.m.",4beecf62-9262-4620-bd88-a849b2b2f4a3
3,methods3,", in order to avoid the midday depression in photosynthetic rate. The relative water content (relative water content (RWC)), i.e., the ratio of water content in fresh to turgid leaves, was also measured on the same leaves used for gas-exchange measurements [10].  2.3. Chemicals and Reagents  Solvents were obtained at the highest purity; other reagents were of analytical grade (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO, USA). Violaxanthin, neoxanthin α-carotene, 9-cis-β-carotene, and 13-cis-β-carotene standards were obtained from CaroteNature (Lupsingen, Switzerland); lutein, zeaxanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin were purchased from Extrasynthese (Z.I. Lyon-Nord, Genay, France). All-trans-β-carotene was from Sigma Chemicals; α, β, γ, and δ-tocopherol standards were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); α, β, γ, and δ-tocotrienol standards were obtained as in [37].  2.4.",97a1818a-ddb3-47ae-a1d7-486658166bd3
4,methods4," Nutritional Analysis  Full-expanded leaves from W and R samples were harvested at 30 days after treatment (DAT) and 50 days after treatment (DAT). The non-edible part was removed. From each sample, a minimum of 500 g was collected and cleaned by removing foreign parts. Then, samples were freeze-dried (Genesis 25SES freeze dryer, VirTis Co., Gardiner, NY, USA) and ground using a refrigerated IKA A10 laboratory mill (Staufen, Germany), then mixed and stored at −20 °C. The AOAC methods were used to determine moisture, proteins, ash, and fiber [38]; fats were analyzed by the method of acid hydrolysis [39]. Tocols and carotenoids were extracted according to Fratianni et al. [3] and determined according to Panfili, Fratianni, and Irano [37,40].  Carotenoids were analyzed through a normal (for xanthophylls) and a reverse phase (for carotenes) HPLC method, as in [3,40].",235fd963-2708-4d34-886c-1a0d03af3332
5,methods5," Analysis were performed by using a HPLC Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) analytical system, comprising a 50 μL injector loop (Rheodyne, Cotati) and a U6000 pump system. Tocol determination was carried out by a Dionex HPLC, through normal phase, as in [3,37]. All tocols were fluorimetric detected by means of a Dionex RF 2000 spectrofluorimeter, at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and an emission wavelength of 330 nm. Compounds were identified through their spectral characteristics and by comparison of their retention times with standard solutions. Calibration curves of each standard solution were used for quantification.  2.5. Statistical Analysis  Agronomical (fresh and dry biomass) and physiological data (relative water content (RWC), photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and mesophyll conductance) were the means of five replicates. Results of nutritional composition and bioactive compounds were the average of three determinations.",75c1666a-720f-426b-98a0-ff5ad59018bb
6,methods6," Data were analyzed by means of the ANOVA test, using a Statistical Software Package for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The significance of difference was set at p ≤ 0.05.  3. Results and Discussion  3.1. Weather Data  The rainfall distribution was that of the period and varied between before and throughout the trial. It was higher from January to April (maximum 102.6 mm) and almost completely absent throughout the experimental trial (0.4 mm). Air temperature was that of the period, with a maximum average temperature of about 30 °C (Table 1).  3.2. Fresh Biomass and Dry Matter Accumulation  The aboveground fresh biomass accumulation (g) was significantly affected by drought stress (Figure 1A). The R treatment resulted in a reduction in chicory biomass of 30% and 52%, compared to W, at 43 and 50 days after treatment (DAT), respectively.",fcdb0d13-74d0-4069-b6fe-39a3ed593ac6
7,methods7," Results also showed that drought stress significantly affected fresh biomass accumulation at 50 days after treatment (DAT), compared to the same treatment at 30 days after treatment (DAT). At 30 days after treatment (DAT), no significant difference between treatments was observed, while, at 50 days after treatment (DAT), rainfed plants showed a 48% decrease in dry matter compared to the well-watered ones, (Figure 1B), The decline in dry matter suggests that the decrease in photosynthesis resulted in a reduction in translocation of photo-assimilates to plant tissues, leading to smaller plants [16]. The literature data indicate a reduction in dry matter due to drought stress in chicory [11,12,13,41].  3.3. Relative Water Content  Rainfed conditions caused a reduction in relative water content (relative water content (RWC)) in chicory leaves (Figure 2).",0c36e507-c76c-4b61-bf2a-6af317753a37
8,methods8," At 30 and 37 days after treatment (DAT), no significant difference between treatments was observed, which may be attributed to the similar tissue water content. At 43 days after treatment (DAT), the relative water content of R leaves was significantly lower than that of W. At 50 days after treatment (DAT), R leaves resulted in the lowest relative water content (RWC), with a 29% reduction compared to W. The leaf relative water content (RWC) was closely associated with photosynthetic gas exchange parameters during different crop growth stages.  3.4. Photosynthesis, Stomatal (gs) and Mesophyll (gm) Conductance  Rainfed conditions caused a significant effect on photosynthesis (Pn) at the end of the trial period (50 days after treatment (DAT)) (Figure 3), with the highest photosynthetic rates in W and the lowest in R.",f3425051-5cd6-499f-8c3a-f49a520b60da
9,methods9," These results suggest that, during the growth stage of rainfed samples, drought-stressed chicory can experience a serious reduction in the photosynthetic rates that can be higher than 25%. The reduction in photosynthetic rates can depend on stomatal and non-stomatal factors [16]. The highest stomatal conductance (gs) was found when the plant was at the first defoliation (30 days after treatment (DAT)), while it reduces, only under rainfed conditions, as the plant grows to the second defoliation at 50 days after treatment (DAT) (Figure 4A). In particular, at 30 days after treatment (DAT), a similar value of gs was found between R and W, while, at 43 and 50 days after treatment (DAT), it was significantly affected by rainfed conditions, showing, at the end of treatment, a 24% reduction in R plants. At 37 days after treatment (DAT), a very strong relationship (r2 = 0.989) between photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance was observed.",9dbea508-c77e-4079-b8e7-e9dd234b98e5
10,methods10," A reduction in the photosynthetic rate during drought stress, due to stomatal closure, has been reported in chicory [12,13], as well as in pepper, mint, and rosemary [16,36]. The results found revealed that, throughout the trial, the mesophyll conductance (gm) of R plants was not significantly different to W (Figure 4B). The weak relationship (r2 = 0.117) between the mesophyll conductance and the stomatal conductance suggested that the reduction in stomatal conductance of R plants did not affect mesophyll conductance. Similarly, throughout the trial, there was a weak relationship (r2 = 0.192) between mesophyll conductance and photosynthesis. The reduction in photosynthesis observed during the end of the trial could be due to stomatal closure; in this case, a consequent reduction in mesophyll CO2 concentration should be observed [42].",1a2628cf-3ebd-4d23-9583-0ef81c8fb697
11,methods11," The mesophyll components generally cause an additional resistance to CO2 diffusion toward the chloroplasts that may increase under stress conditions [16,36,42,43], and it is likely to be controlled by the mesophyll structure [44]. The similar gm observed in irrigated and rainfed leaves, during the whole harvest time, indicated that gm did not contribute to increasing the resistance to CO2 diffusion in rainfed chicory leaves. This result revealed that photosynthesis was not directly affected by the resistances to CO2 diffusion. The reduction in stomatal conductance might have resulted from stomatal closure, which prevents CO2 from entering the leaf, leading to a decrease in photosynthetic carbon assimilation.",617dd1d5-1750-47bd-8260-e7a4c32accf7
12,methods12," The strong relationship between Pn and gs indicated that stomatal closure mostly regulated the reduction in Pn, whereas the weak relationship between Pn and gm demonstrated that the reduction in Pn was not affected by an additional resistance to CO2 diffusion toward the chloroplasts [16]. As previously discussed, rainfed conditions restrict chicory plant growth and productivity, also reducing the uptake and the diffusion of CO2, and such conditions also alter different biochemical reactions, which further inhibit photosynthesis [16,45].  3.5. Nutritional Composition  In Table 2 the chemical composition of R and W samples, at 30 and 50 days after treatment (DAT), is reported. Data are expressed as g 100/g dry weight (d.w.). Results are in accordance with the values in the literature [5,46]. A slight significant decrease in fats and increase in proteins was found between the two sampling times. Between the two water regimes, no significant differences were observed.",5503af1b-b169-48c9-8b81-64560b0859e6
13,methods13,"  Eight carotenoid compounds were detected and identified, as follows: violaxanthin, neoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin (xanthophylls), and α-carotene, β-carotene, 9-cis-β-carotene, and 13-cis-β-carotene (carotenes) (Table 3). Lutein was the main carotenoid (about 55–100 mg/100 g d.w.), while β-carotene accounted for 13–20 mg/100 g d.w. Quite high amounts of violaxanthin and neoxanthin were also found. Lutein and β-carotene have been reported as being among the major carotenoids found in green leafy vegetables, even if also other carotenes and xanthophylls were detected [3,4,47]. Results are in the same order of magnitude of different data in the literature [3,4,48]. At 50 days after treatment (DAT) in R samples, a significant increment of xanthophylls was observed, ranging from about 27% for neoxanthin to 44% for zeaxanthin. No significant increases of carotenes were found. The total carotenoid amount was, significantly, 22% higher in rainfed samples.",80db9388-4ed5-4ee0-8ae3-6a209d08e979
14,methods14,"  In accordance with other papers in the literature [3,49], only α-tocopherol (α-T), from about 30 mg/100 g d.w. to 40 mg/100 g d.w., and γ-tocopherol (γ-T), from about 10 mg 100/g d.w. to 18 mg/100 g d.w., were detected. No tocotrienols were found. At 50 days after treatment (DAT), as compared to W samples, there was a significant 20% increase in total tocols in R plants, changing from about 15% for α-T to 40% for γ-T (Table 4).  The down-regulation of photosynthesis can be linked to damage of the photosynthetic apparatus and an increased thermal dissipation, as a photo-protective process. Here, ROS are produced, as a result of over-photooxidation, which disrupts photosynthetic activities by lipid peroxidation. Alfa tocopherol is reported to be involved in response to water deficiency [30,31,32,33]. This occurs in two phases, as follows: in the first phase, α-T is synthetized to scavenge the ROS; in the second phase, tocopherol degradation is induced by a severe stress.",4973d7d5-97dd-42af-837f-48d41a559a93
15,methods15," The first phase is prevalent in stress-resistant species and, therefore, a higher tolerance to drought resulted in higher α-tocopherol content [31]. According to our results, fruits from water-stressed plants were also found to contain more γ-tocopherol than those from control plants [23]. The induced concentrations of tocopherols depend upon severity of prevailing stress, its intensity, and species-specific response [20,21]. From the literature, there are controversial results on the effect of water stress on carotenoids. From our results, an increase in xanthophylls was observed, similar to the literature papers where an increment in the xanthophyll cycle components was demonstrated in different plant species under stress conditions [25,50,51]. This cycle consists of the enzymatic interconversions of violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and zeaxanthin in the thylakoid membrane.",4cd09799-dba6-4531-bbd1-2eef141de06a
16,methods16," It can be considered as another important protective mechanism that helps to minimize irreversible oxidative damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. The physiological function of lutein in stress tolerance is not well understood, but different papers report an increase under drought, due to its effect as a secondary barrier [52,53].  4. Conclusions  Information coming from our results confirmed the adverse effect of the absence of rainfall, and the consequent drought stress conditions, on the agronomical and physiological parameters of chicory plants. On the contrary, an increase in tocol and xanthophyll amounts after water stress imposition was observed. The latter results add information to the scarce available literature on chicory and give further insights to the evidence that moderate drought stress can positively affect the content of these components.",64a3fd24-f283-4c6d-9083-fef166f8f488
17,methods17," The overall findings indicate that drought stress can be practiced on chicory in areas where a challenge to irrigation water occurs, with important implications for agricultural practices aimed at saving water in arid and semi-arid growing regions.
