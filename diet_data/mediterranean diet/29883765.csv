0,introduction0,"In order to understand the specificities of the human microbiome assembly, extensive meta-analyses of human and non-human primate microbiomes have been recently carried out [1,2]. This comparative approach has led to the identification of several compositional changes along with a progressive reduction of biodiversity as the main distinctive features of the human gut microbiome (GM) along the evolutionary history [1]. Interestingly, these hallmarks have been found to be exacerbated in Western urban populations compared to traditional and rural counterparts [3–6]. In particular, consistent with the disappearing microbiota hypothesis [7], the dramatic shrinkage of individual GM diversity in Western urban populations is deemed to depict a maladaptive microbiome state which may contribute to the rising incidence of chronic non-communicable diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, asthma and inflammatory bowel disease [8–11].",9b2126e4-4107-4837-ae33-a117ab575325
1,introduction1," Consequently, in recent years, a large body of research has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms leading to the alterations in the Western urban GM. It is in this scenario that the multiple-hit hypothesis has been advanced [8]. According to this theory, the progressive changes in the human GM and especially the reduction of biodiversity have occurred at multiple stages along the recent transition to modern urban societies, and several aspects typical of the urbanization process—such as sanitation, antibiotics, C-section and Western diet—have been pointed out as contributing factors. In particular, the reduction in quantity and diversity of Microbiota-Accessible Carbohydrates (MACs) in the diet has been considered one of the leading causes of the disappearing GM in Western urban populations [8].",00cec6b4-b105-402a-bc87-29370e3c26b8
2,introduction2," Recently defined, dietary MACs include all types of carbohydrates, coming from a variety of sources including plants, animal tissue or food-borne microbes, which—indigestible by the host—become available as an energy source for a specific GM fraction enriched in Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZymes) [8,12]. Moreover, food additives, emulsifiers and xenobiotics–ubiquitous in industrially processed foods–have recently been shown as important additional drivers of GM diversity shrinkage [13].  All currently available studies exploring the disappearing GM are based on the comparison between Western urban and traditional rural populations [3–6,14–16]. Consistently, the observed GM differences are likely to be the result of the combined action of several covariates in addition to the diet–i.e. ethnicity, geographical origin, climate, subsistence, medication, hygiene and life sharing–and do not allow to weight the importance of the single determinants.",37fda421-c4d8-4ea1-8180-c5838972e77f
3,introduction3,"  In the last few years, the Modern Paleolithic Diet (modern Paleolithic diet (MPD)), with high intake of vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, eggs, fish and lean meat, while excluding grains, dairy products, salt and refined sugar, has attracted substantial public attention in the Western world because of its potential multiple health benefits [17–22].  In the present work, we profiled the GM structure of 15 Italian subjects following the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) and compared it with that of 143 urban Italian individuals largely adhering to the Mediterranean Diet (MD) from our previous works [5,23].",04d3222e-f1fe-49fe-800f-a36f18fc75d5
4,introduction4," Notwithstanding the small sample size, our GM exploratory study gave us the unique opportunity to assess to what extent the adoption of a Paleolithic dietary pattern, based on the consumption of MACs deriving from plant-based foods–but not grains–along with the exclusion of industrially processed food, may modulate the GM of Western urban populations, possibly helping to counteract the GM diversity reduction. Indeed, the comparison between modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) and Western diets in subjects living in the same country allows excluding the impact of confounding drivers of GM variation, such as geography, ethnicity, medication, hygiene and subsistence [14,15,23].",ea8638d5-33eb-4ee9-a26e-e5ca22a9227c
5,introduction5," In order to extend the GM comparison at the meta-population level, we included in our analysis publically available microbiome data from traditional hunting and gathering populations showing an “ancestral” high-diverse GM profile, such as the Hadza from Tanzania, from our previous publication [5], the Matses from Peru [6], and the Inuit from the Canadian Arctic [24].  According to our data, the consumption of unprocessed foods and dietary MACs from plant-based foods–albeit with the exclusion of grains and pulses–as observed in modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) individuals, could contribute to a high GM diversity, similar to that typically found in traditional rural populations, even in a Western urban context. However, we also identified peculiar compositional features, such as a high relative abundance of bile-tolerant and fat-loving microbes, worthy of being further investigated for the potential health risk.

26,results10,"  Despite the small sample size, it is worth noting that the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) microbiome shows several compositional differences with respect to the other cohorts, which well match the peculiar macronutrient intake (Fig 2; S4 Table). In particular, compared with all other populations, except for the Inuit (as expected based on available dietary information), the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) fecal profiles are enriched in asaccharolytic genera, such as Sutterella and Odoribacter [25], in Bilophila, microorganism typically associated with animal protein and saturated fat consumption [26,27], as well as in Akkermansia, known to be associated with the consumption of unsaturated fat [28] (P-value ≤ 0.021; Wilcoxon test). Although Akkermansia has recently been identified as potential next-generation probiotics, its role in inflammatory contexts is still controversial and requires further investigation [28–31].",33c87bfb-d775-4030-b4be-e8516a0ad22a
27,results11," Moreover, when compared to hunter-gatherer populations (whose subsistence, at least during sampling, was mainly based on tubers and other plant foods), the microbiome of modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) subjects shows increased relative abundance of the bile-tolerant Bacteroides, Collinsella and Dorea (P-value ≤ 0.003). Bacteroides is indeed typically associated with Western-type animal-based diets [26], the genus Collinsella is known to comprise bacterial species capable of deconjugating bile acids and positively correlated with plasma cholesterol levels [32], and Dorea has recently been suggested to be involved in the production of the secondary bile acid, deoxycholic acid [33]. It should be remembered that secondary bile acids are generally associated with increased risk of non-infectious bowel disease and colorectal cancer [34], which stresses the need to be cautious in adhering to this dietary pattern in the long term.",55c139e7-73b6-4c44-b2a1-5ddd0797120a
28,results12," On the other hand, it should be noted that, compared to traditional populations, modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) profiles show greater proportions of the SCFA producers Lachnospira and Coprococcus (P-value ≤ 0.008).  We also evaluated the Prevotella ratio, i.e. the ratio of Prevotella to the sum of Prevotella and Bacteroides [35] (S3 Fig). These genera are indeed recognized as biomarkers of diet and lifestyle, with Bacteroides typically associated with high-protein high-fat Western diets and Prevotella with carbohydrate/fiber-based diets typical of more agrarian societies [35,36]. Although no detailed dietary information is available for traditional populations, Hadza and Matses diets are known to be heavily based on the consumption of highly fibrous tubers and vegetal foods [5,6]. On the other hand, the fiber intake of modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) individuals (29.47 ± 20.49 g/day) does not exceed by far that reported for urban MD Italians (range, 10.37–21.02 g/day; [23]).",0f5c513e-7551-42ba-ad02-db71ef7063be

According to our findings, the microbiomes of the study groups segregate by geographical origin, with a further separation within the Italian cohort reflecting the diet pattern (modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) vs MD). This provenance-dependent effect on the human GM structure probably involves the concomitant action of several covariates, which concur in shaping the GM structure, such as geography, ethnicity, lifestyle and dietary habits. The Italian origin of the GM seems to be defined by a higher abundance of Bacteroides, Collinsella, Coprococcus and Blautia, bacterial genera commonly found within Western healthy microbiomes [3–6].",1660541a-6430-4a7f-af55-2f5615a82739
31,discussion1," According to the literature, the separation due to geography seems to be less evident among the traditional populations, with Matses and Hadza sharing a high abundance of Prevotella [5,6]. These data confirm recent findings that demonstrate the predominance of host location and ethnicity (including diet, lifestyle, environmental exposure, socio-economic development, etc.), with respect to diet alone, as determinants of human GM variation [14,15].  Despite the overall Western-like configuration, the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD)-associated GM structure stands out from that of urban Italians adhering to the MD for several features that could be related to the peculiar dietary pattern. These mainly include a greater relative abundance of asaccharolytic bacteria (i.e. Sutterella and Odoribacter) [25] as well as of fat- and bile-loving microorganisms, such as Bilophila [26,27].",901e8e79-ba77-44ac-9c48-ce35a0db8ade
32,discussion2," In light of the known associations between changes in the bile acid pool, in particular with increased production of secondary bile acids, and increased risk of non-infectious bowel disease and colorectal cancer [34], the increased presence of these bacteria could constitute a red flag for human health, worthy of being further explored possibly in long-term studies.  On the other hand, it is worth noting that the levels of fiber-degrading SCFA producers, such as Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Lachnospira and Coprococcus, are comparable between modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) subjects and other Italians, suggesting that even excluding grains and legumes, the high serves of fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds in the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) could ensure adequate supply of MACs to the GM.",d31b697b-6cca-4e29-88df-a7603e65cc8e
33,discussion3," The most interesting data is, however, the much higher degree of microbiome biodiversity found in modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) individuals than other Italians, which well approximates that observed in traditional hunter-gatherer populations. As recently discussed, a high species diversity could promote healthy competition among microbial symbionts and modulate bacterial interactions, ultimately maintaining the overall ecosystem stability [37]. Our findings therefore seem to suggest that even in extremely different geographic locations, with disparate cultural practices, environmental exposure, economic development and other lifestyle factors, the ancestral microbiome could be at least partly restored.",e9853425-1825-499a-928a-d8c94c25bc36
34,discussion4," Since the Italian subjects of our cohort share the provenance and all that it entails, including the lifestyle, it can be hypothesized that the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD)-associated bloom in GM diversity is accounted for by the peculiarities of the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) compared to the MD. Though the two diets are similar in many respects–i.e. high intake of fruit, vegetables, fish and nuts, as well as low glycemic load–the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) is in fact distinguished by: (i) consumption of MACs from plant foods but excluding grains and legumes; (ii) total exclusion of industrially processed products; (iii) higher intake of unsaturated fatty acids, especially MUFAs, from olive oil, nuts and meat; (iv) no consumption of foods containing refined sugars [17–20].",29aef241-067b-40d8-a664-288b5e9884a6
35,discussion5," It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that these modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) distinctive features may be sufficient to support the consolidation of a highly diversified GM layout, thus counteracting the loss of GM biodiversity, typically observed in Western urban populations as compared to traditional communities [3–6]. However, at least two important considerations must be made in relation to biodiversity: i) simplifying the GM to a measure of biodiversity has obvious limitations as it does not reflect its compositional structure, including the complex ecological interactions existing among its members [38]; ii) a reduced diversity is not necessarily detrimental to the host, especially when it is a consequence of the selective enrichment of health-promoting symbionts [37–39].  In conclusion, we shed some light on the effects of the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) on the GM structure and diversity in Western urban populations. Despite the limitations of this observational study (i.e.",8adc1920-c7a8-4c90-bbde-2fdc9fd9a30a
36,discussion6," cross-sectional nature and small sample size), our findings suggest that the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) could be a means to counteract the risk of losing the bacterial memory that has accompanied our ancestors throughout human evolutionary history. The consumption of MACs from plant-based foods–but not grains–at the expense of refined sugars, and the minimization of the intake of processed foods, both hallmarks of the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD), could indeed act synergistically in maintaining an eubiotic level of GM diversity. The high intake of MUFAs, as found in the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD), suggests that these fatty acids could play a role in supporting high GM diversity, which is worthy of being further explored in larger cohorts. However, we cannot exclude that other genetic or lifestyle-related factors not considered in the present study are involved.",bdaf25c3-03e7-41aa-8958-1e65c02d8dc4
37,discussion7," On the other hand, we do not know how this high-diverse GM will behave over time in a context so different from that of our ancestors. Furthermore, the presence of some red flags, such as the overrepresentation of bile and fat-loving microbes, requires attention for potential long-term health effects. Albeit several studies have suggested intriguing potential benefits of the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) in obese and type 2 diabetes patients in the medium and long term (i.e. increase in insulin sensitivity, glycemic control and leptin levels, and lowering of total fat mass and triglyceride levels) [18,40,41], particular caution must be taken when following Paleolithic diets for a long time with percentages of macronutrients so far from nutritional recommendations, at least until more comprehensive longitudinal studies in larger cohorts, including randomized controlled trials, fully assess the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD) impact on host health.
