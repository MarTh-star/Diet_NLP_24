It is composed of 11 food groups, namely: dairy products, cereals and starchy foods, meat, fish, legumes and traditional dishes, vegetables, fruits and nuts, snacks, sweets and salty snacks, beverages, and fats. The frequency of food consumption was assessed in the following categories: daily consumption (once a day or more than twice a day), weekly (from once or twice a week to three to six times a week), monthly (from one to three times a month), and no consumption or occasional consumption [26].  2.4.

Body weight was measured using a vertical mechanical scale with SECA700® sliding weights, with an accuracy of 100 g. Height was measured with an accuracy of 0.2 cm, using the vertical statimeter. Using the data of weight in kg and height in cm, the body mass index (body mass index (BMI) = weight/height2; kg/m2) was calculated. body mass index (BMI) was interpreted using the World Health Organization classification (body mass index (BMI) < 18.8 = underweight, body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24.99 = normal weight, body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 29.9 = overweight, and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 = obesity). Body perimeters were measured in triplicate (after obtaining the mean) using an extendable tape measure. Waist perimeter measurements were performed below the rib cage and above the navel (narrowest waist circumference).",db17cfc2-f1ab-492d-a72e-7dc09f0681f6
11,methods11," The perimeter of the hip was measured horizontally at maximum extension of the buttocks (larger posterior protrusion).

To assess the presence of cardiovascular risk, classification was made according to the waist-hip index (ICC = waist/hip index). In the case of women, the cardiovascular risk was determined when the index was ≥0.85 and, in the case of men, when it was ≥0.94. A clinically validated digital scale with OMRON model HBF-212EW impedance was used to obtain the percentage of fat mass. To assess the percentage of fat mass, the parameters established by the Spanish Society for the Study of Obesity were taken into account; the normal percentage of fat ranges between 12 and 20% in men and between 20 and 30% in women [32].  2.7.

Discussion  The results of the present study indicate that after a two-year dietary nutritional intervention, the experimental group showed significant weight loss and percentage of fat mass, as well as a greater reduction in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. However, no differences were found between the groups in terms of hip circumference or waist–hip index. In relation to the PREDIMED, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 questionnaires, the results indicate that during these two years, the experimental and control groups improved their scores on the PHQ-9 questionnaire; however, no significant differences were observed between groups. Finally, there was no significant improvement in the PREDIMED and GAD-7 scores over time.",f46afe52-c1d1-4f34-bd6a-ab510ef2845d

In addition, when compared with the control group, they observed a greater reduction in waist circumference among the participants in the experimental group (experimental group: −3.3 cm and control group: −.7 cm; p < 0.001).

In another study, a low-calorie MD pattern was claimed to be effective in reducing body weight, body mass index (BMI), and fat mass; body weight decreased by 1.",1660b37f-d073-46ad-9090-41aedd8e72eb
21,methods21,"77 kg and body mass index (BMI) and fat mass decreased by 0.67 kg/m2 and 1.46 kg, respectively [35].  In relation to adherence to the MD, according to the results obtained, although no significant improvement was observed in either group, the experimental group increased their score from an initial 9.2 to a 10.2 at the end of the intervention. These findings are in line with those observed in other studies, such as Zuniga et al. [36], where a slight improvement was observed for the MD at the end of the intervention (experimental group: pre: 7.1, post: 8.7; control group: pre: 7.4, post: 7.6). A possible explanation for this slight improvement observed in our study could be the fact that our intervention coincided with the period of COVID-19 confinement, which could have made it harder for patients to adhere to a healthy dietary pattern and obtain better results in the PREDIMED questionnaire [37,38].",fd582933-5b68-45ee-9779-338a386dcca8
22,methods22," In addition, it must be taken into account that our sample already had good adherence to MD at the start of the intervention with very good values and, as described previously, it is the patients with baseline eating habits that are the farthest from a healthy diet who they are more likely to achieve greater changes in adherence [39].  The MD, owing to its foods and consumption frequencies, stands out as a potential means to help delay the progression of cognitive decline. Although no firm conclusions can be drawn at this moment, this dietary pattern is also considered a potential mean to reduce the prevalence of mental illness such as depression and anxiety [40,41]. In studies by Sánchez-Villegas et al. [20] and Mantzorou et al. [21], the MD pattern was associated with a lower risk of depression. In addition, in other studies such as the Sanchez-Villegas et al.",16df8798-1867-4026-b427-c0fb95678b1a
23,methods23," [42] trial performed on older subjects, it was revealed that higher levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)), rendered by MD enhanced with walnuts and almonds, could prevent depression, memory loss, and cognitive decline. However, a recent study showed that the consumption of walnuts altered some metabolic syndrome biomarkers but did not significantly change the waist circumference, body weight, or body mass index (BMI) in older populations, stressing that the components of MD work in synergism to lower these markers in elders [43]. Similarly, Opie et al. showed that a wholesome MD rather than individual nutrients is recommended for the prevention of depression [44]. Jacka et al. [22], on his part, observed that a dietary pattern characterized by consumption of fruits, vegetables, beef, lamb, fish, and whole foods was associated with a lower risk of anxiety.",78f15054-23a3-4dc1-9e26-f86679ef3a87
24,methods24,"  In the present study, it was observed that throughout the two-year intervention, both the experimental and control groups improved their scores on the PHQ-9 questionnaire; however, no improvement in the scores for the GAD-7 questionnaire was observed. A possible explanation for the lack of significant improvement in the scores of the GAD-7 questionnaire could be that, as mentioned previously, our intervention coincided with the period of COVID-19 lockdown, which generated a decrease in social interaction due to social distancing, which could have a negative impact on anxiety levels [45]. Nonetheless, this improvement in the scores of the PHQ-9 in both groups represents an important outcome for the improvement of people’s health. Especially, in older people, mental health is one of the most important aspects for health maintenance; mental health is important for their social participation, as in order to maintain their autonomy, older people must have optimal mental health [46].",8a3112f6-1bd6-4430-a3c3-d7c355b2bbc2
25,methods25," In addition, psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety increase the risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus [47]. Therefore, the improvement of the participants in their score for the PHQ-9 questionnaire could generate, in turn, a reduction in the risk of chronic diseases mentioned previously and thus present a better state of health.  Thus, in general, our results suggest that a two-year intervention based on MD allows the older population with overweight or obesity to achieve greater weight loss, as well as a greater decrease in body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and percentage of fat mass.  This study has several limitations. First, the sample size was small, which may be associated with greater uncertainty regarding the measured effect.",c65c4820-b9ce-458b-8aa4-a6dcf3f45bea
26,methods26," Because of the small sample size, the differences would have to be greater to reach statistical significance; therefore, although there is a real difference, its existence cannot be guaranteed. Second, this small sample size comes from a single city in Spain; therefore, caution should be used when generalizing the findings to other areas of Spain or Europe. Third, the measures were estimated based on self-reported data, which could imply that some participants underestimated their answers to the questionnaires.  5. Conclusions  A two-year intervention based on the MD pattern may be effective for weight and fat mass loss, as well as for the reduction of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in the older population with overweight or obesity. In relation to adherence to MD, no significant improvement was observed after two years of intervention. Finally, future research should explore the impact of the MD on mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. ",8b59a34f-1cbb-4842-94d9-bcd93b8dd649
