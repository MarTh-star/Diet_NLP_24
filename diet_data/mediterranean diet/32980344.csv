0,analysis0," Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard error,whereas percentages were used to express dichotomous variables. Long-term changes in BF and reactive hyperaemia area (RHA) at 6 years were assessed with a T-test for related samples. Repeated-measures ANOVA and post-hoc multiple comparisons analysis with Bonferroni’s correction were used to investigate the effects of diets on BF and reactive hyperaemia area (RHA) and the differences between atherothrombotic risk groups. The chi-square and the Monte Carlo test were performed to evaluate the distribution of the TRS2P components among the three risk groups. All analyses were adjusted for gender and drug therapy (statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) at baseline. A 2-sided p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed by the use of SPSS 23 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0.

6,discussion0," The current study found that the consumption a healthy dietary pattern (MedDiet or low fat diet (LFD)) over 6 years can lead to a long-term improvement in Microvascular EF (MEF) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Indeed, both BF and reactive hyperaemia area (RHA) improved compared with baseline measurements, regardless of the type of healthy diet. Furthermore, although this benefit was evident in all patients, those at low-risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) recurrence, according to the TRS2P score, showed an even greater improvement in their reactive hyperaemia area (RHA), compared with the moderate and high-risk groups.  EF is impaired in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia17,31–33. Drug treatment of these conditions was shown to improve macro- and microvascular EF in the short-term3,31–36. On the other hand, different dietary patterns may modulate EF.",7981d1dc-6472-4f6c-a4a6-2251b807f23a
7,discussion1," In a previous report from our group, the long-term consumption of a MedDiet, rich in extra virgin olive oil, for 1.5 years improved flow mediated dilation (FMD) in the brachial artery in patients with diabetes and prediabetes, while the consumption of a low fat diet (LFD) stabilized flow mediated dilation (FMD)10. A recent meta-analysis, including 7 randomized controlled trials using flow mediated dilation (FMD), confirmed these results37. Regarding low fat diet (LFD), the evidence on its impact on EF is controversial with some authors reporting an improvement in EF after a few weeks of low fat diet (LFD) consumption7,13, and others finding that EF remained stable after one year of follow-up12,15. Of note, the available studies focused on assessing the effect of low fat diet (LFD) in obese or diabetic patients without ASCVD7,12–15.",4b60288b-ef06-4f5e-a0f8-1b628a958418
8,discussion2," Up-to-date, it had not been clarified whether these effects of healthy diets on EF, especially in Microvascular EF (MEF), persisted or disappeared over time.  With regard to microcirculation, previous studies demonstrated that MedDiet increased Microvascular EF (MEF) at 8 weeks in patients over 65 years, alone or in combination with exercise 25,38. This benefit was also observed in patients with hypercholesterolemia or metabolic syndrome, when evaluating postprandial Microvascular EF (MEF) with laser doppler flowmetry (LDF) 23,24. There are varying underlying mechanisms that may account for the benefits of a MedDiet on Microvascular EF (MEF). On one hand, extra virgin olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and phenolic compounds, both of which reduce superoxide production and decrease the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)) particles, thus inhibiting the development of atherosclerotic plaque and endothelial dysfunction39,40.",92ada8ee-2a18-47f8-8e56-97887c0d758c
9,discussion3," On the other hand, oily fish increases NO bioavailability, by upregulation of endothelial NO synthase, whereas green vegetables, grains and legumes are the provisions of inorganic nitrate and L-arginine, which are NO precursors37. Oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are interrelated1. In fact, long-term consumption of a MedDiet rich in extra virgin olive oil was linked to a reduction in the plasma/serum concentration of pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6, a C-reactive protein, adhesion molecules and in the chemokines in the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) Study41,42, where the MedDiet reduced the relative risk of major cardiovascular events in patients without ASCVD. Most of the evidence about low fat diet (LFD) derives from studies invovling vascular beds other than microcirculation.",b372f34c-b8c0-48d4-bb92-6fa8d4df16dc
10,discussion4," Therefore, the findings of the current study are the first to assess long-term impact of low fat diet (LFD) on microcirculation with laser-doppler technology, and confirmed that both MedDiet and low fat diet (LFD) can improve Microvascular EF (MEF) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).  In the current study, patients were classified according to TRS2P to evaluate whether long-term changes in Microvascular EF (MEF) after the implementation of a healthy dietary pattern were associated with individual’s risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) recurrence. This hypothesis could help to implement diverse dietary approaches for patients with a different coronary heart disease (CHD) severity, with a more personalized approach.",41b68ee9-7dfd-422e-a136-594a8c1890b5

12,discussion6,"  The aim of the current sub-study from the CORDIOPREV trial was not to evaluate the incidence of atherothrombotic events, but to compare the changes in Microvascular EF (MEF) between risk categories according to TRS2P in the environment of a long-term dietary intervention. We found that both MedDiet and low fat diet (LFD) improved Microvascular EF (MEF) in a similar way in the low, moderate and high atherothrombotic risk groups. However, the low-risk TRS2P group showed a greater improvement in microvascular reactivity (assessed by the reactive hyperaemia area (RHA)) compared with the moderate and high-risk groups. These findings suggest that, although a healthy dietary pattern can beneficially affect BF in all patients in a similar way, microvascular reactivity to ischemia improves more in low-risk patients according to TRS2P. In previous studies, only patients classified as moderate or high-risk benefited from more intensive pharmacological treatment 28–30.",a2adb576-e1f4-4179-bedf-abced21dd84d
13,discussion7," However, in the current analysis, it seems that the low-risk patients benefited most from the dietary intervention. Therefore, although this improvement in Microvascular EF (MEF) has not been correlated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular events yet, the role of dietary recommendations in all patients with cardiovascular disease should be highlighted, especially in low-risk groups who may not benefit from more intensive drug therapy and who may gain more from adherence to a healthy dietary pattern, according to the findings of the current study.  To our knowledge, this is the largest study up-to-date evaluating the long-term effects of two dietary healthy patterns on Microvascular EF (MEF) (i.e., BF and reactive hyperaemia area (RHA)) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).",9d26c67e-c42b-4f84-a9bd-6d235898a89b
14,discussion8," However, there are certain limitations, including the lack of possibility of generalization to other populations without CVD, the fact that Mediterranean Diet was used in a country where it has a high acceptation and may not be extrapolated to other countries, or that we performed a high intensity dietary intervention which could be difficult to achieve in other settings.  In conclusion, a long-term healthy dietary intervention with MedDiet or low fat diet (LFD) significantly improved microvascular BF in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients, regardless of their baseline atherothrombotic risk (defined by the TRS2P). Microvascular reactivity to ischemia (as assessed by reactive hyperaemia area (RHA)) also improved in all coronary heart disease (CHD) patients following a healthy dietary pattern, but this improvement was greater in patients at the low-risk category compared with those at the moderate and high-risk groups.",cf08e2bc-6dca-4499-9311-e79b3046a60d
