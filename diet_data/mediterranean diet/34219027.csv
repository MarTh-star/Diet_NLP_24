0,methods0," 2.1 Participants  This cross‐sectional study is part of the project “Promoting Healthy Lifestyles” conducted among Spanish adolescents. 24 All students in the first and second years of secondary education from 22 high schools located in southwestern Spain (omitted for a blind review) were invited to participate. The study was conducted between March and June 2019, before the COVID‐19 pandemic. During this period, baseline assessments were completed in different high schools. From an initial sample of 2217 participants, 644 were excluded for the following reasons: 614 did not report screen time, 4 did not report physical activity, and 26 did not report sleep duration. A final sample of 1573 adolescents, aged 12–16 years old (861 girls and 712 boys), participated in this study (the student response rate was 70.95%).  The adolescents and their parents or guardians were informed about the aims of this study, and all provided written informed consent for participation.",37a3993f-8e02-4e35-a413-8f7f70534b47
1,methods1," This study was approved by the Declaration of Helsinki and Ethics Committee of the University of Extremadura (89/2016).  2.2 Measures  2.2.1 Sociodemographic factors  Participants self‐reported age and sex, while socioeconomic status was obtained according to the average income level per household unit in each of the cities/towns of the region of Extremadura. 25  2.2.2 Health‐related behaviors  Screen time  Screen‐based behaviors of the Youth Leisure‐Time Sedentary Behaviour Questionnaire (Youth Leisure‐Time Sedentary Behaviour Questionnaire (YLSBQ)) were assessed. 26 The Youth Leisure‐Time Sedentary Behaviour Questionnaire (YLSBQ) is a valid and reliable questionnaire to assess screen time among Spanish children and adolescents. 26 The questionnaire assesses the amount of screen time spent during both school and non‐school days (e.g., during the last week, how much time did you usually spend watching television on school days/on non‐school days?).",afe9d7ac-28bc-41c2-bdee-0e9ffc8ab6ce
2,methods2," Adolescents self‐reported the habitual time spent on television, video games, computers, and smartphones separately on both school and non‐school days. Seven possible answers were available for each screen‐based device: no time, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, and ≥5 h. Usual screen time on school and non‐school days was measured by the sum of time spent on each screen device on school and non‐school days, respectively (usual television, video gaming, computer, and smartphone duration on school days and non‐school days).  Physical activity  Physical activity was assessed using the Spanish version 27 of the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ‐A). 28 The PAQ‐A is valid and reliable for measuring physical activity levels in Spanish adolescents.",8e340782-0394-4fc6-acca-40edc97bd21f
3,methods3," 27 This instrument has nine questions that measure the frequency of participation in physical activities in the previous 7 days at different moments, including during physical education, school breaks, lunchtime, after school, evenings, and weekends. Each item is scored on a 5‐point Likert scale ranging from 1 (low physical activity) to 5 (high physical activity). Once a value from 1 to 5 is obtained for each of the 9 items, the average value of these 9 items is taken, resulting in the final physical activity index.  Sleep duration  Sleep duration was assessed using a Spanish translation of a valid and reliable sleep questionnaire. 29 Adolescents self‐reported their typical bedtime and wake‐up time on school and non‐school days in the preceding 7 days. These questions have been shown to be a valid (r = 0.45–0.90) and reliable (ICC = 0.71–0.99) measure for examining sleep duration in children aged 9–12 years.",40feb109-28a4-48d7-863a-948beff717ed
4,methods4," 30  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet  This diet has been characterized by a high quantity of vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, fruits, nuts, edible grains and bread, potatoes, poultry, beans, and olive oil, as well as being low in red meat. 31 The Mediterranean diet has been positively associated with a wide range of health indicators such as health‐related quality of life and cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness. 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed by the Spanish updated version of the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index for Children and Adolescents (KIDMED). 35 , 36 This questionnaire has proven to be valid and reliable in Spanish youth. 35 The KIDMED consists of 16 yes/no questions about food consumption, of which 12 questions are positively scored (+1, e.g., consumption of fresh or cooked vegetables more than once a day) and four are negatively scored (−1, e.g., going to a fast‐food restaurant more than once a week).",0b00e85d-6a2f-4af7-9403-93f3d34ede8c
5,methods5," Consistent with previous studies, the adherence to the Mediterranean diet index is calculated as the sum of each answer and ranges from −4 to 12.  2.2.3 Physical fitness  Cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength were included as a measure of physical fitness, since a systematic review conducted by Carson et al. 3 reported that both were most consistently associated with screen‐based behaviors.  Cardiorespiratory fitness  Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured using the 20 m shuttle run test by a member of the research team at the school. Participants were instructed to run between two lines separated by 20 m at a cadence set from a pre‐recorded audio file. The frequency of the sound signals progressively increased at each level (1 min per level) by 0.5 km/h from an initial speed of 8.5 km/h. The test ended when students failed to reach the end line at the prescribed pace on three consecutive attempts or voluntarily discontinued the test.",99d86424-4560-4689-bcdf-8b5b86fb78cc
6,methods6," The final score, computed as the number of stages completed, were converted into ml/kg/min using the equation of Leger et al. 37  Muscular strength  Muscular strength was assessed using both the handgrip and standing long jump tests. 38 A hand‐held dynamometer, with an adjustable grip (TKK 5101 Grip D; Takey), was used to measure upper body strength. The test was complete twice and the maximum score in kilograms for each hand was recorded. The average score of the left and right hand was calculated. To account for differences in body size, handgrip strength was expressed per kilogram of body weight. The standing long jump test was used to assess lower limb strength. Participants stood behind the starting line, with feet together, and jumped forward as far as possible. The distance was measured from the starting line to the point where the back of the heel nearest to the take‐off line landed on the ground.",7156ee4a-c093-4c4d-9da1-080b9fede240
7,methods7," Participants completed the test twice and the longest distance was recorded in centimeters. According to previous studies, 39 , 40 , 41 muscle strength was calculated by adding the z‐score (upper and lower body strength) and dividing by 2 to average them.  2.2.4 Fatness  Fatness measurements were performed by two members of the research team of the same sex as the students being evaluated. These persons were specialized in skinfold measurements (the highest official certificate in Spain), in order to reduce possible measurement errors. The measurements were carried out at school, in a room close to their usual classroom.  Body fat percentage  Skinfold thicknesses were measured on the non‐dominant side of the body to the nearest 0.1 mm with a Holtain caliper on the triceps and subscapular sites. The body fat percentage was calculated from the triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses using Slaughter's equations.",37d0c79b-2e7b-4266-9cbd-d607b1a31031
8,methods8," 42 Two non‐consecutive measurements were performed on the non‐dominant side of the body and averages were recorded. 38 Skinfold thicknesses were also assessed twice, and averages were recorded. Both measurements were conducted with participants dressed in shorts and a T‐shirt.  2.2.5 Academic performance  Academic performance  School grades for four subjects: First Language (Spanish), Mathematics, Foreign Language (English), and Physical Education were provided at the end of the academic year by each high school. Consistent with previous studies, 43 , 44 academic performance was calculated as an average of First Language (Spanish), Mathematics, Foreign Language (English), and Physical Education grades. The average rating score can range from 0 to 10 in each subject.  2.3 Data analysis  Data analyses were performed using JASP software version 0.13.12020 (JASP Team University of Amsterdam, Netherlands). We adopt an alpha level of 5% for statistical significance.  2.3.",a4b3115f-e1d5-4ff7-8c1a-997dd28f3946
9,methods9,"1 Descriptive and correlational analyses  The mean, standard deviation (SD), or percentage (%) was calculated for the sociodemographic characteristics, health‐related behaviors, body fat, physical fitness, and academic performance. The distribution of all variables was checked both by means of graphs (normal probability plots) and statistics (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; p > 0.05). Differences between boys and girls were tested using Student's t‐test for continuous variables and chi‐square test for categorical variables. Pearson bivariate correlations between all study variables were conducted (i.e., higher Pearson correlation coefficients represent a greater degree of relationship).  2.3.2 Cluster analysis  Cluster analysis was conducted based on the standardized scores of total daily minutes of screen time on school and non‐school days. Cluster analysis was divided into two steps.",e02f5f20-8519-4031-bdcd-cbff718475bb
10,methods10," 45 First, a hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted using Ward's method based on squared Euclidean distances. 46 , 47 Second, k‐means cluster analysis was used to obtain the final cluster solution, including the initial cluster centers extracted for each possible number of cluster solutions from the first step. The optimal number of profiles was determined through the examination of statistical indicators (Bayesian Information Criterion [BIC] and Akaike Information Criteria [AIC]), the statistical adequacy of the solution (i.e., lower scores in BIC and AIC are better), and the substantive meaning and theoretical conformity of the extracted profile (i.e., the solution is theoretically reasonable and parsimonious and there are no clusters with <10% of the participants). To examine the reliability and stability of the final cluster solution, the sample was randomly split into two halves, and the same two steps previously described (Ward's and K‐means) were tested.",b98781df-8d64-437e-a76e-ccd57d95b33b
11,methods11," 48 Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to assess the degree of agreement between the classification of adolescents of each of the new subsamples and the original sample. An agreement of at least 0.60 is considered acceptable. 46  2.3.3 School and non‐school day screen time profiles and their differences in health and educational indicators  Chi‐square and Cramer's V tests were used to determine the association of cluster solutions with sex. Cramer's V values above 0.10 were considered small, above 0.30 medium, and above 0.50 large. 49 Cluster differences in health‐related behaviors (i.e., physical activity, Mediterranean diet, and sleep duration), physical fitness (i.e., cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength), fatness, and academic performance were conducted using a covariance analysis (a covariance analysis (ANCOVA)).",3f9275cd-0070-4bf9-92f5-3c0b13a6588a
12,methods12," Since significant differences were found between screen time profiles and age, sex, and socioeconomic status, they were added as covariates or confounding variables. Physical activity and Mediterranean diet were also added as covariates when they were not used as dependent variables. Tukey's post hoc test was conducted when significant differences were found in the study variables between the different profiles. Effect sizes above 0.01 were considered small, >0.06 moderate, and over 0.14 large. 49  3 ",09cdfc97-49d5-4588-b7c4-1a71b88f968a

15,results3,"2 Cluster analysis  We estimated models for 2–10 profiles. The four‐cluster solution was selected as the best representation, based on the visual inspection of AIC and BIC and on theoretical assumptions. Regarding the BIC and AIC, we found a decrease on the slope in the four/five cluster solution; see File S2. Furthermore, when moving from four to five clusters, we found two clusters with non‐substantial differences in time spent on screen‐based devices. In addition, the number of participants in one of the groups was lower than 10%. This four‐cluster solution also showed good stability and replicability (K = 0.83). Figure 1 shows the graphical results for the four‐cluster solution based on z‐scores for school and non‐school screen time.

Firstly, this study aimed to identify screen time profiles using total daily minutes of screen time on school and non‐school days.",6a18d3b6-a91a-43f3-84e2-21cd9fd594d7
22,discussion1," Analyzing school and non‐school day screen time profiles is necessary not only to identify possible combinations, but also to examine their implications for adolescent health. Relying on a person‐centered approach, four combinations of screen time on school and non‐school days were identified in this sample of Spanish adolescents. A profile characterized by low screen time on school and non‐school days (“Low‐low”) was composed of almost 40% of adolescents. Moreover, another profile of adolescents with the opposite combination (“High‐high”) was found, accounting for 15% of the sample. However, these two profiles only represent 55% of the adolescents of this study. The other two profiles characterized by low high screen time on school days and high screen time on non‐school days (“Low‐high”) and the opposite (“High‐low”) found account for 22.3% and 22.6% of the sample, respectively.",39ce49f1-98ea-4679-b0a1-4aeb6397d887
23,discussion2," Although in the “High‐low” and “Low‐low” profiles, there were approximately the same number of boys and girls, in the “Low‐high” and “High‐high” profiles, there were more boys. This could be because boys typically spend more time on screens, especially on non‐school days, while girls spend more time on other more educational or social sedentary behaviors. 11 , 50 All these cluster results suggest that, although approximately half of the adolescents have the same amount of time spent on school as on non‐school days (“Low‐low” or “High‐high”), the other half of the adolescents spend more screen time during school or non‐school days (“High‐low” or “Low‐high”). It is important to note that in absolute values, screen time on school days was higher than screen time on non‐school days in the four profiles identified in this study. The labeling of the profiles is thus a matter of gradation.",18dde7c6-f6e5-42ef-8eab-dc108f9618db

Most studies have also pointed out that adolescents spend more screen time on non‐school days than on school days, as well as that boys spend more time on screen‐based devices. 10 , 11 Because this is the first person‐centered study that combined screen time spent on school and non‐school days to perform a cluster analysis it was not possible to compare it with previous studies.  Having identified different combinations of school and non‐school screen time profiles, the second objective was to extend previous research by examining their possible differences in health‐related behaviors (physical activity, sleep, and Mediterranean diet), fitness, fatness, and academic performance.",225c67d0-a637-4cfa-964c-a65a0c7f90b9

However, there were no significant differences in physical activity, Mediterranean diet adherence, and sleep duration on non‐school days between the “High‐low” and “Low‐high” profiles, except for sleep duration on school days, which was higher in the “Low‐high” profile. These results suggest that adolescents with high values for screen time on both school and non‐school days reported worse physical activity, sleep duration, and Mediterranean diet.

28,discussion7," Participants who belong to the “Low‐low” profile showed a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet than other profiles in the present study. In particular, other studies have suggested that the use of recreational screen time such as video games or television is often associated with the consumption of ultra‐processed foods in adolescents. This could be because when adolescents spend time engaging in screen‐based devices, they are not aware of their eating habits. 57 The lower Mediterranean diet adherence found in the “High‐high” profile in our study could also be explained by the fact that adolescents in this profile also reported shorter sleep duration and lower levels of physical activity. Therefore, in line with a previous systematic review, a lower compliance with 24‐h Movement Guidelines could also explain a poor Mediterranean diet.",908077a8-22dc-4765-a29a-e97cb8cd0339

The displacement hypothesis could also explain why sleep duration during school days is shorter in those adolescents who spend more time on screen‐based devices during school days. Although significantly lower sleep time values on non‐school days were found in the “Low‐high” profile compared to the “Low‐low” profile, no differences were observed between the “High‐low” and “Low‐high” profiles.",90ee75eb-1c4b-449a-8feb-a16a2b342416
30,discussion9," These results suggest that since adolescents do not have to go to school on non‐school days, high screen time on non‐school days does not seem to be related to sleep duration on non‐school days, since they may wake up later. However, consistent with aforementioned previous studies, 7 , 15 , 16 it should be noted that the correlation analysis identified a higher degree of relationship between screen time on school days and health‐related behaviors in this study. Further studies using a person‐centered approach are required to shed light on whether screen time on school and non‐school days can be more harmful in health‐related behaviors.  With respect to body fat and physical fitness (i.e., muscular strength and cardiorespiratory fitness), there were no significant differences among the four clusters identified in this research.",00ded921-affd-44c3-915f-018cfd5b3e45
31,discussion10," Previous systematic reviews have found that the use of some recreational screen‐based behaviors such as video games and/or computers appears to have a detrimental consequences on body composition 60 and physical fitness. 3 However, the quality of evidence if these systematic reviews was low because of a serious risk of bias (i.e., the risk of a systematic error or deviation from the truth, in results or inferences). 3 In our study, the different screen‐based devices were not separated to perform the cluster analysis, so it was not possible to determine if different types of sedentary behaviors may be related in a different way on these variables.",29685fbe-8fec-4e88-803c-aeaea9ae5493
32,discussion11," 3 , 5 Given that the intensity of physical activity may influence the relationship with physical fitness, 3 , 5 another possible explanation could be because the instrument used to measure physical activity in this study did not allow us to know its intensity, so it was not possible to know whether the adolescents of the different profiles participated in physical activity at a higher or lower intensity. In addition, the profile with low screen time on school and non‐school days could also have high non‐screen‐based sedentary time (sedentary behaviors related to social time or educational time). Therefore, more studies analyzing not only the time spent on different screen‐based devices during school and non‐school days, but also non‐screen‐based sedentary time, and the intensity of physical activity, are needed to shed light on the relationship between these variables.  Finally, significant differences between the four identified profiles and academic performance were found.",082f3114-1147-4312-ad65-0f82c1c06268
33,discussion12," Our results indicate that adolescents who spent a high screen time during school days reported poorer academic performance, while high screen time on non‐school days does not appear to be detrimental if accompanied by low screen time on school days. The majority of previous studies also showed an inverse association between screen time and academic performance. 18 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 Our results are consistent with previous research that showed that the screen time spent by adolescents during school days is more damaging than on non‐school days on academic performance. 12 , 13 , 14 In fact, some studies have found a positive relationship between a high amount of screen time on non‐school days and academic performance. 12 , 13 , 14 These more detrimental outcomes could also be explained by the displacement hypothesis, 17 which suggests that excessive screen time on school days could interfere with academic activities such as doing homework, studying, etc.",3b5fc377-b5cc-42ca-ab3d-43931190f342
34,discussion13," Previous research also suggested that recreational screen time could replace other activities such as physical activity or sleep duration, due to the finite amount of time in a single 24‐h period, 18 leading to lower academic performance. However, the results of this study suggest that a high amount of screen time on non‐school days may not necessarily interfere with academic performance if adolescents also spend time on academic activities.  4.1 Limitations and future directions  The present study has some limitations that provide future research avenues. First, its cross‐sectional design precludes drawing conclusions about the cause and effect of screen time profiles and health and educational indicators. Therefore, further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these screen time profiles, the direction of the relationships examined, and how these profiles differ in terms of health and educational indicators.",f71e8539-f024-4468-a207-d93c90dd7d82
35,discussion14," Second, although the instrument used to measure screen time is valid and reliable, it did not allow us to know the purpose and context in which it was used and whether it was used actively or passively. 65 There is a need to develop new valid and reliable instruments to measure screen time on different screen‐based devices, differentiating them by mode (active or sedentary), purpose (recreational or educational), and context of use (school or leisure time). Third, although the questionnaires used to assess physical activity and sleep duration were valid and reliable, they were self‐reported. Future studies should use device‐measured physical activity and sleep duration. Fourth, because total screen time on school and non‐school days was examined, it was not possible to determine whether some screen‐based devices might have been more harmful than others. Future studies should determine whether time spent on school and non‐school days on each screen‐based device (e.g.",f17bda5d-79e4-461a-a966-bbf1cd09916a
36,discussion15,", TV, video games, computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.) could be more or less detrimental to different health and educational indicators. Finally, given that the study was conducted in a non‐representative sample of Spanish adolescents, the results cannot be generalized to all adolescents or other age groups. Future studies should be conducted with a representative sample of Spanish adolescents from different regions.  4.2 Strengths  Despite the limitations noted above, this research presents several strengths that should be highlighted. First, the relatively large sample of adolescents that participated in this study ensured that there was a sufficient sample in each profile regarding statistical power. Second, this is the first study that identified school and non‐school screen time profiles using a person‐centered approach.",f1222690-a853-4896-9088-63e4a436f328
37,discussion16," Third, few studies have examined the possible differences between screen time on school and/or non‐school days and a wide range of health and educational indicators and none using a person‐centered approach. Finally, unlike most previous studies, four of the most used screen‐based behaviors have been examined.  5 ",4bbe60f1-5a2d-45f6-90fc-35d6bde0031b
38,conclusion0," In conclusion, our results indicate that adolescents who accumulated a large amount of screen time on school and non‐school days reported worse health‐related behaviors and academic performance. Adolescents who had high screen time on school days reported only a short sleep duration on school days and worse academic performance than on non‐school days. Given the high values of screen time found in the four screen time profiles and their differences found in different health and educational indicators, conducting interventions to reduce screen time in these profiles becomes essential to improving adolescents' healthy lifestyles and academic performance. It seems especially important to reduce screen time on school days in such screen time profiles to improve sleep duration on school days and academic performance.
