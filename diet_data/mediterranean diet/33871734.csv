0,discussion0," Dietary guidelines in general, and IDGs in particular, established a basis for public food and nutrition, health, and agricultural policies, and for nutrition education programs to promote healthy eating and lifestyles in the general population (58). In this paper, we described the process of development of IDGs to share with the scientific community the processes leading to its release, its adaptation to the national context, and the compromises that, in some cases, the commission accepted to pursue what was considered reachable to consumers' behavioral changes.  The Evolution of IDG  IDGs key messages are aligned with recommendations of the WHO Healthy Diet Fact Sheet (58, 59) in terms of promotion of consumption of fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts; and limiting free sugars, salt, and fat, use of iodized salt.",238977a3-ea28-445f-9bd4-26cd49d44b54
1,discussion1," The recommendations of limiting red meat and avoiding processed meat and the consideration of alcoholic beverages as a harmful component of the diet were introduced in the present revision of IDGs to be in line with international recommendations. In fact, despite different geographical, socio-economic, and cultural contexts among countries, most of the pivotal nutritional recommendations are similar.  Since the first edition, IDGs changes reflected the best of nutritional science's available evidence. Without necessarily going through the text of the different revisions (in Italian), the idea of the changes is provided by the evolution of the titles of the directives of the IDGs across the years (Table 2). In the directive on bodyweight in 2003 and 2018, the physical activity recommendation was introduced in response to its increasing importance in the framework of bodyweight management (First line of Table 2).",42af6745-bdbb-46fc-80c5-316a2cc7d242
2,discussion2," The number of directives was 7 in the 1986 and 1997 revisions and was increased to 10 Directives in 2003. The 3 directives added to the 2003 revision were related to the importance of water as a nutrient, and the correct hydration as an element of healthy eating. A directive on food safety in response to the momentum of the outbreak of several food safety emergencies (e.g., mad cow, dioxin chicken, etc.), and a directive aimed to provide specific recommendations for groups, such as pregnant and lactating women, infants and children, and the elderly, were introduced. In 2018, the overall number of directives further increased to 13 with the inclusion of directives on fruit and vegetables, which, in the previous revisions, were treated in a unique directive with whole grains and legumes, slimming diet and supplements, and sustainability, as presented in this paper. The language of the different IDG revisions evolved across the years.",1cb5be18-9150-43e9-9a48-20138c8a7cb0
3,discussion3," In the 1986 and 1997 editions, the prescriptive language was more common than in the 2003 revision and was further attenuated in IDGs published in 2018. For example, the directive on fats (Third line of Table 2) progressively become more qualitative, as the focus on cholesterol was eliminated in response to the literature evidence, and the combinations of qualitative and quantitative aspects were further added in recent years.

6,discussion6,"  IDGs Policy Implications  Aligning the dietary guidelines with the latest evidence, not just on healthy eating but also on the wider social and environmental implications of dietary choices is, therefore, an important starting point for enabling a policy coherence and building a food environment that contributes to good public and personal health, as well as to local and global environmental sustainability (60–62). The inclusion of sustainability in dietary guidelines is an open exercise that is still in progress in several countries. According to Springmann et al. (63), the inclusion of sustainability aspects into the national dietary guidelines, as well as in the WHO guidelines, could be beneficial not only from a health perspective but is also necessary for meeting global sustainability goals (64) and staying within the environmental limits of the food system.",274baeb6-3f0b-4a7d-9cb0-2c2447f0ad86
7,discussion7," In IDGs, we demonstrated that it is possible to translate for consumers, the practical recommendations aimed to improve their behaviors in terms of environmental and social protection other than health. Probably, the strategy of prioritizing recommendations for health protection and combining them with environmental aspects avoided the confusion by being the most coherent public health nutrition document as IDGs. Considering that the IDGs' targets are families and individuals, even a few selected sustainability recommendations could have a large population impact. Limitations of this approach were largely discussed during the coordination meetings, along with the process of IDGs' development. The sustainability of diet is an aspect of the environmental impact of food production that is still not completely exploited, in which the risk of bias and “personal” interpretation is still high.",ca9b7d99-eebd-4d51-adab-9c330b045894
8,discussion8," At the time of IDGs preparation, the sources of information were limited, and the consensus documents were almost absent. As reported by Rosi et al. (65), the dietary recommendations, in terms of environmental impacts, should also consider the aspects related to the choice of locally grown and seasonal products, as well as agricultural and processing techniques, to approach globally the sustainability of the food system. However, it should be pointed out that the overall estimation of the different aspects of sustainability of the food system is still lacking.  The policy implications of IGDs are not different from other countries' nutritional guidance. A particularly relevant issue in this sense is how to properly communicate the information to the public in the current era of widespread and largely uncontrolled dissemination of information via an almost limitless variety of media outlets.",9d9371d9-0a04-411e-8cde-a26dac9aeecc
9,discussion9," Indeed, the nutritional issues, which are often intrinsically complex, are difficult to report comprehensively and, even when truly balanced, frequently fail in general communication and online communication (66). The long process of IDGs' development required cooperation among different Italian stakeholders, such as scientists, clinicians, and policymakers, who have an active part in the process. After the IDGs publication, to be maximally effective in terms of policy, the involvement of other society segments, such as the food private sectors, the communications areas, and the education sector, was carried out with different approaches such as evidence briefs, policy dialogues, and benchmarking. The Authors are conscious that these steps are just at the initial phases and that much more needs to be put in place.  IDGs for Developmental Ages  According to Herforth et al.",3fe6eff3-d5f9-46d2-bb64-8b349ad14993
10,discussion10," (67), the worldwide available Food-based Dietary Guidelines state that they apply to the general population: 46% qualify this statement with a “healthy” population and 13% refer to the general “adult” population. Over half (52%) specify an age above which the guidelines apply: almost all of these refer to age 2 years and older, although two countries, instead, specify 1 year, one country says 3 years, and three countries say 5 years. Forty percent of countries have separate messages or guidelines for specific subpopulations, which include infants under 2 years of age, school-aged children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, the elderly, and others. The IDGs' recommendations cover all age groups from infants to the elderly, including physiological conditions, such as pregnancy and lactation, to stay healthy during different periods of life.",3f088ab9-9f1b-4a11-9076-19708efd63af
11,discussion11," In this overall approach to all classes of ages, the Editorial Coordination Board decided to have a specific focus on infants, children, and adolescents providing practical recommendations with indicative serving sizes for consumption, expressed either as food items or food groups for developmental ages, to create menus coherent with the principle of a healthy and balanced diet. Another similar exercise was carried out by Kastorini et al. (68), that starting from Dietary Guidelines addressed to the general population, the developed food-based nutritional and physical activity recommendations for promoting healthy dietary habits in Greek infants, children, and adolescents proposed menus based on traditional Greek diet. Montagnese et al. (69) analyzed and compared the different European food-based dietary guidelines and reported that specific recommendations regarding children were provided in 21 countries (59%), while recommendations for adolescents were provided in 17 countries (50%).",b40a266f-1fd8-46ea-9860-10cca9af838e
12,discussion12," They pointed out that more emphasis should be given to some subgroups of the total population that currently represent a clear prevention target such as adolescents. Schwartz et al. (70) also evaluated the extended coverage of the international and national dietary guidelines of the themes of infants and children feeding habits. They concluded that guidelines, in general, cover most of the themes, but some of the national guidelines are incomplete. However, guidelines could be an occasion to give more practical tips to parents, especially to help them establish an appropriate feeding behavior for their children. According to United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) (71), only some of the guidance for specific groups are developed and disseminated as part of the national guidelines. The level of specificity in guidance for developmental ages varies greatly.",23e22a5d-e47b-4e55-a861-86a5d63daaa8
13,discussion13," For example, some countries provide very detailed guidance on how to initiate and maintain breastfeeding, how to choose and safely use infant formula, and how to introduce complementary foods. Relatedly, some newer DGs, including IDGs, also focus on the social role of meals in the family and the community, on the transmission of food skills to children and adolescents, and on the role of marketing and the need to limit the exposure of children to marketing, but also to educate children and adolescents on this issue. Some countries' DGs have also begun to address a wider range of behavioral issues around food and diets, including responsive feeding, parenting to help children develop healthy habits and healthy relationship to foods and eating, and addressing the developmental stage of adolescence. A specific chapter on adolescence was also included in the IDGs.",779d7a63-073a-4414-9a62-dda5081bb688
14,discussion14," The reasons for these differences are related to the fact that, especially in high-income countries, the government's guidance for specific groups (most commonly, infants, young children, and pregnant and lactating women) is developed through parallel processes and by specialized scientific societies, such as pediatrics, gynecologists, etc.  The Limits of IDGs  The philosophy of IDGs is that the more plant-based a diet is, the more it is health-promoting and sustainable and that, among the different sources of proteins, red meat presence in the menu represents a critical issue both in terms of sustainability of the food choices and occurrence of non-communicable diseases.",f06926f7-1eb2-4b22-a271-d631bb048fdb
15,discussion15," The IDGs consider that to promote human health and to reach an environmentally sustainable solution, the animal-based foodstuffs should be partially replaced with fruits, vegetables, legumes, and cereals, and among animal source foods, a selection of milk, eggs, fish, and white meat leads to better health promotion and environmental outcome in addition to being most in line with nutritional recommendations. However, such changes are hard to achieve at the population level considering that the diet to be promoted does not only depend on nutritional recommendations, but also needs to consider the social and practical aspects, cultural factors, and consolidated behaviors. The starting point of changes needs to be the current food consumption pattern of the population considering that large behavioral changes are difficult to be achieved. Indeed, advice towards drastic changes risks being ineffective.",343d2031-8a7f-4924-92e4-704b927eb59c
16,discussion16," Instead, modulating the current consumption to achieve the nutritional and environmental goals step by step would result in a better outcome. The IDGs are important tools to inform policies and promote public health. To facilitate and improve adherence to IDGs and to have a real effect on food consumption, recommendations need to have clear links to Italian food policies.  It is widely recognized that even in high-income countries with a long history of developing, communicating, and otherwise implementing evidence-based DGs, the dietary patterns are far from ideal. It is important to acknowledge that while the development of DGs is necessary, which is to inform consumers and to program food and nutrition policy, their implementation is very far from sufficient (71). The main limitation of the IDGs is related to the existing gap between dietary recommendations and actual consumer behavior indicating the generally poor compliance of IDGs.",a164e280-663c-4c27-ac67-d93a8da0eecd
17,discussion17," An IDGs' implementation strategy is as equally important as the development of the evidence-based document. The need for effective communication to assist in translating the recommendations into practical and actionable advice is widely acknowledged and has been included as part of the global release of guidelines (72), even though in Italy, an articulated plan of developing strategies to assist behavior change is still lacking. The length of the process in developing and publishing the documents was another relevant limitation of IDGs. The question of whether a better compromise could be found remains open; for example, reducing the number of consultations. For example, discussions at the level of scientists that better know the literature could be reduced. On the other hand, probably, we should prioritize the consultations with stakeholders other than researchers to speed up the process.  Conclusive Remarks  With this paper, we got the challenges of Bechthold et al.",af7a8c07-21e1-432e-93a3-5d3512bb51d9
18,discussion18," (73) that claimed efforts to have a common concept for the future derivation of European Food-based Dietary Guidelines. With the description of the Italian experience, we would contribute to the debate on the complexity of derivation of Dietary Guidelines, and their adaptation to the national context. We fully agree with the idea that a common European concept could serve as a starting point for the derivation of the national dietary guidelines that, however, need to be adapted to each country-specific condition. But to develop the common concept, we think that it is important to analyze the different experiences to get the lessons learned and to find cross-cutting recommendations to share, as well as valorize local peculiarities.
