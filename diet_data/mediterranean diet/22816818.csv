0,background0,"Dietary pattern analysis, based on the concept that foods eaten together are as important as a reductive methodology characterized by a single food or nutrient analysis, has emerged as an alternative approach to study the relation between nutrition and disease [1-4]. As reviewed by Hu [4], dietary pattern analysis is a different method to examine the effect of overall diet: food and nutrients are not eaten in isolation, and the ‘single food or nutrient’ approach will not take into account the complex interactions between foods and nutrients. Two major methods are used to reduce complex dietary data: a hypothesis-oriented approach using previous information to stratify a dietary pattern and a statistical approach using study-specific data to rank individuals (principal component analysis or reduced rank regression models) [5,6].",16faaf92-d8c9-455d-be80-4a4dbf71565a
1,background1," The Healthy Eating Index (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)) and the Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) are two frequently used hypothesis-oriented approaches [7-10]. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) represents the degree to which a dietary pattern conforms to official guidelines summarized in the United States Department of Agriculture Food Guide Pyramid [11-13]. This system was first proposed in 1995 by Kennedy et al. and further refined in function of evolving Dietary Guidelines and intakes in function of recommended levels, resulting in a 2005 and 2010 version (abbreviated in this paper respectively as Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-1995, Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005, and Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010). In contrast to the original version the more recent versions of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) use an energy-adjusted density approach, limiting the possible confounding effect of total energy intake [12,13].",8af582c6-16a0-4252-8b0c-8057b53bb82e
2,background2," The most recent version, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, is made up of 12 components, 9 adequacy components (total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, greens and beans, whole grains, dairy, total protein foods, seafood and plant proteins, fatty acids) and 3 moderation components (refined grains, sodium, empty calories) [13]. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) is composed of seven desirable components (cereals, vegetables, fruits and nuts, legumes, fish, a high dietary ratio of mono-saturated to saturated fatty acids and moderate alcohol consumption) and two undesirable components (meat and dairy food products). Both systems use adequacy or desirable and moderation or undesirable scoring systems but for different components.  Vegetarians differ from omnivorous subjects in their eating pattern by the exclusion of meat and fish (lacto-ovo-vegetarians) or by the exclusion of all animal derived products (strict vegetarians or vegans).",520d42c4-62ff-45fe-8469-7ace32a8b54d
3,background3," On the other hand, these restricted diets are generally higher in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Nutritional analysis indicates lower protein, (saturated) fat and higher carbohydrate and fibre intake. In most of the studies, vegetarian macro- and micronutrient intake is closer to the recommendations [14-17].  Higher scores on Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005 and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) are related with positive health outcomes [18,19] whilst several health advantages are attributed to the vegetarian diet [20,21]. Since both indexing systems vary in the definition of optimal diet quality and in their scoring mechanism they may differ in their sensitivity to capture differences between vegetarian and omnivorous subjects.",f4fd88d7-aff6-4ac7-9ae7-f8ca529f0133
4,background4," Indeed, the more recent versions of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005 and Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010) do not require any single commodity in order to achieve a high score whilst the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) includes specific sources. Especially the possibility to include both animal and plant protein sources in the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005 and Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 make these indexes amenable for vegetarian diets. In contrast, the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) uses more traditional components such as meat and fish, which may be a weakness when analyzing alternative diets [12,13,18].  Up to now, the number of studies using these indices for the comparison between vegetarians and non-vegetarians is limited [12,22]. Kennedy et al.",243664ae-c625-4de9-bbc5-b231debf0c2e
5,background5," [22] calculated the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-1995 for 642 vegetarians compared to 9372 omnivorous subjects from the American Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CFSSI)) between 1994 and 1996. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-1995 was significantly lower for the vegetarians compared to the omnivorous subjects. In contrast, calculating the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005 on data of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2004, Farmer and colleagues found that the dietary quality of non-dieting vegetarians was superior compared to their omnivorous counterparts. However, the profound adaptations between the original and the latter iterations of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), make a comparison over the different versions difficult.  In the study of Costacou et al. [23], principal component analysis revealed four dietary patterns amongst 28.",51ba62e9-4738-4e76-a47f-b26e160cfdd4
6,background6,"034 Greek participants of the EPIC study: a Mediterranean, a Vegetarian, a Sweet and a Western dietary pattern. In that study, the data driven Mediterranean-resembling component was strongly positively associated with the hypothesis driven Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) whilst the Vegetarian approximating component was unrelated with the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). The latter indicates that amongst these Greek participants, subjects with a vegetarian-type diet consume food groups not matching properly with the components of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). This points again to the possible limitations of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) for the evaluation of restricted diets.  The literature on Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores for vegetarians remains equivocal and to the best of our knowledge no comparison between vegetarian and omnivorous subjects has been made using the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS).",daee1bff-f3c8-423e-be66-3032d2d69ee9
7,background7,"  In most studies, self-selected or post examination detected vegetarians are compared with standard population references or a non-matched sample. In order to reduce lifestyle bias [24], comparison according to the matched samples principle is advised [17,25]. It was the aim of this study to compare the nutrient intakes and the diet quality in properly matched vegetarian and omnivorous subjects. Two dietary pattern analysis methods, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were calculated and analysed in function of the followed diet.

8,methods0,"Since no register of vegetarian subjects exists, purposeful sampling was conducted. Vegetarian subjects were actively recruited in the Flemish region of Belgium through advertising in health food shops, and on the website of vegetarian associations. Inclusion criteria were being a vegetarian for at least one year and being at least 18 years of age. Vegetarianism was defined as abstinence of meat, game, poultry, and fish in the diet. This purposeful sampling resulted in the collaboration of 69 vegetarians. Matching was done either by the vegetarian subjects recruiting themselves a proxy of the same age, gender, health and lifestyle characteristics (n = 20 vegetarians) or by matching according to sex, age, BMI, level of physical activity, tobacco use and alcohol consumption using a data set of 1520 omnivorous subjects [14,15]. All subjects completed a 3 days food diary (2 week days and 1 weekend day).",b1b900b9-9449-4255-9b50-3b1bb82d5c87
9,methods1,"  All diaries contained an instruction manual including portion size or weight or volume of common household measures. Volunteers were asked to weigh the consumed food items when possible or otherwise to indicate portion size of the common food items. Analysis of the food records was performed with the BECEL software program, using Belgian nutrient composition tables. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were computed as described earlier [13,18]. For both indexes population ratio scores over the 3 days were calculated. The possible scores for Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 ranged from 0 to 100 and for Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) from 0 to 9, with a higher score for a healthier pattern.  For baseline characteristics mean and standard deviation were calculated. To improve clarity, the components of Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were expressed as mean and standard deviation.",f7321882-ef41-47de-9c04-83d54e3ca969
10,methods2," Due to the general non-normality of the data distribution after visual control and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, differences between vegetarians and omnivorous subjects were tested with the Mann–Whitney U test. Ethical clearance was obtained by the Ethical Committee of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. ",8c399dbe-d4d1-415b-8239-ceff31a4d41d
11,results0,"More vegetarian women (n = 49) than men (n = 20) were prepared to participate in the study and completed the 3-days diary. Mean age of the vegetarian women and men was respectively 35 ± 12 and 39 ± 14 years, for the omnivorous subjects mean age was respectively 36 ± 12 and 40 ± 14 years (both p >0.05). Mean BMI was 22 ± 4 kg/m2 for the vegetarian women and 23 ± 3 kg/m2 for the vegetarian men compared to respectively 23 ± 4 and 24 ± 3 kg/m2 for their omnivorous counterparts; both p > 0.05. Comparison of age, BMI, physical activity, smoking habits and physical activity indicated a proper matching of all the subjects [15].  Mean total energy intake was comparable between vegetarians and omnivorous subjects (p > 0.05), (Table 1). Macronutrient analysis reveals significant differences between the mean values of the vegetarians and the omnivorous subjects. Absolute and relative protein intake was significantly lower for the vegetarians compared to the omnivorous subjects.",a44efc18-3b85-4f4a-8a97-fe57747237c8

The mean values of the desirable Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) components indicate significant lower intakes of cereals and fish and significantly higher intakes of fruits and nuts for the vegetarian compared to the omnivorous subjects. For legumes a trend towards a higher intake (p < 0.1) was detected when comparing vegetarian with omnivorous subjects.",37cf8e12-597a-49ac-989d-3396e43a30f6
13,discussion0,"In the present study nutrient intake and dietary indices, Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), were calculated for properly matched vegetarian and omnivorous subjects.  Nutrient analysis indicates significant differences between the vegetarians and the omnivorous subjects. In general macro- and micronutrient intake was closer to the recommendation for the vegetarians compared to the non-vegetarians. These data are completely in agreement with the results of Farmer et al. [12] and Kennedy et al. [22] reporting a more nutrient dense intake for the vegetarians compared to the non-vegetarians. Similar nutrient intakes are reported in most of the studies on vegetarians [21].  The recently released Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 allowed the discrimination between a vegetarian and omnivorous dietary pattern of properly matched health conscious subjects with a higher overall quality index for the vegetarians compared to the omnivorous subjects.",9918b353-5fcc-4edb-9749-30098c64ec63
14,discussion1,"  This is completely in line with the results of Farmer et al. [12] using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005 where non-dieting vegetarians obtained a higher score compared to non-dieting omnivores. In contrast, using the 10-component Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-1995 method, Kennedy et al. [22], reported lower quality scores for the vegetarians compared to the omnivorous subjects. The results of Farmer et al. [12] together with ours confirm the applicability of the more recent proposed Healthy Eating Index (HEI) methods - with refinement towards vegetables and plant protein components - to estimate the quality of more restricted plant based diets.  The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) resulted equally in higher values when applied on the vegetarians compared to the omnivorous subjects, reaching only borderline significance. The latter may be inherent to the method of this model where scores are attributed based on the median value of the different components.",8458de88-da28-4f2d-830c-4fd5028716da
15,discussion2," Although most of the plant-based Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) components seem to be higher in the vegetarian compared to the omnivorous subjects, they do not always reach significance. In the case of legumes, this may be due to the considerable intake variability and the small sample size.  In this model vegetarians can never obtain scores for the desirable component fish whilst omnivorous subjects always score above the median for the undesirable component meat. Hence, the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) loses discriminative power on 2 of the 9 components. This may be an indication that the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) needs further elaboration with regard to more plant-based nutrition with a more balanced or possible contribution for alternative components [26].  Indeed, Costacou et al.",f76e36ce-f470-4f00-9fdf-9fad081b459b
16,discussion3," [23], did not find a relation between the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and the “Vegetarian like component” but identified clusters of dietary patterns, sharing similar dietary behavior and showing a strong preference to the “Mediterranean” and the closely related “Vegetarian like component”. The discriminative power between two populations with a rather healthy eating pattern seems to be weaker for the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) compared to the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010. It was indeed demonstrated that the studied population (vegetarians and controls) showed healthier eating and lifestyle habits compared to the Belgian population [27]. Nevertheless, for both methods scores for vegetarians and omnivores were only weak to moderate. This may be an indication that the nutritional intake of both groups needs further improvement.",af3251d4-6f4a-456d-a6e3-dcd49a54afe5
17,discussion4," The lower scores for the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) indicate equally that this model does not allow scoring of components, which may be part of a healthy diet besides the components of the Mediterranean Diet. The more recent released versions of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005 and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2010) allow several types of healthy diets.  On the other hand, the combination of components from the different systems may result in conflicting information. In the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 the dairy component is an “adequacy” component whilst it is an “undesirable” component in the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). In agreement with the Farmer study we found a higher dairy intake for the vegetarians compared to the non-vegetarians [12]. Indeed, the dairy component may be an important calcium source but may equally have its impact on the fatty acid balance.",2edbeee2-d019-45fd-a05f-1df88b667532
18,discussion5," The latter, in combination with the absence of fish in the diet, may be an explanation for the weak score on the fatty acid ratios in the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) for the vegetarians.  A weakness of the present study is the purposeful sampling of vegetarian subjects and the matching based -amongst other- on health related parameters (BMI, physical activity level, smoking habits). The latter resulted in a health conscious sample of omnivores which was not representative for the Flemish population [15,27]. Also, none of the used indexes was specifically developed for a Belgian population. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) is a measure used to asses diet quality in terms of conformance to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans [13] whilst the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) is based on a more Southern European region consumed pattern [23,26].",fee47067-9f63-4904-be06-f78df3be4727
19,discussion6," However, the latest Belgian food Consumption survey indicated substantial differences between the usual food consumption and the Belgian food based dietary guidelines [26]. The reported inadequacies are comparable with those reported for the American population (high protein and fat intake, low fruit and vegetable intake, high saturated fatty acid and added sugar intake). Moreover, the Active Food Triangle as used in Belgium for the promotion of a balanced diet shows great resemblance with the USDA Food Pyramid [28]. In the most recent update of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) [13] it was equally assumed that the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 could be considered valid for different ethnic and cultural groups.  Indeed, several reports indicate that the older versions of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) as well as the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) used in different European populations add valuable information to the estimation of diet quality [23,29].",60dc7e70-229e-4960-a749-7459aa957a64
20,discussion7," The discriminative power for two small health conscious groups may be considered an indication for the robustness of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 with sufficient sensitivity for omnivorous and more restricted diets. Future research should not only use these indices on larger, representative samples but use in longitudinal designs may help to unravel the relation between diet quality and different health outcomes.  Conclusions In conclusion, the vegetarian diet as consumed in our sample is closer to the nutritional recommendations compared to the omnivorous diet. The latter resulted in a higher Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 score and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) for the vegetarians compared to the matched omnivorous subjects. The updated Healthy Eating Index (HEI) (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010) method allows adequate scoring of restricted diets.",ea2aae9d-67d4-4e99-8ad8-e42222dff628
21,discussion8," Despite two components not allowing alternatives when comparing vegetarians with non-vegetarians (meat and fish), the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) is still able to discriminate between the vegetarian and omnivorous subjects.
