0,methods0," 2.1. Study Population  This is a cross-sectional study conducted on the participants of the Mediterranean healthy Eating, Aging, and Lifestyles (Mediterranean healthy Eating Aging and Lifestyles (MEAL)) study, an observational study aiming to evaluate the association between dietary and lifestyle factors and health outcomes in subjects living in the south of Italy. Between 2014 and 2015, a random sample of 2044 adult (age 18+ years) men and women was enrolled in the urban area of Catania, the second biggest city of Sicily, southern Italy. Full details about the study protocol (rationale, design and methods) have been reported elsewhere [14]. Inclusion criteria were the following: (i) age > 18 years old, (ii) born and resident in Sicily, and (iii) Caucasian race; exclusion criteria were (i) serious disabling diseases (i.e., terminal illness, chronically bedridden patients, etc.), (ii) mental illness, and (iii) pregnancy.",704ae0f1-a2eb-40dd-b216-c217bc68224c
1,methods1," The study procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1989) of the World Medical Association. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants and the study protocol was agreed by the ethics committee of the referent health authority.  2.2. Data Collection  Demographic (i.e., age, sex, occupational and educational level) and lifestyle information (i.e., smoking habits, physical activity) was investigated. Occupational level was divided into four categories: (i) unemployed, (ii) unskilled workers, (iii) partially skilled workers, and (iv) skilled workers. Educational level was classified into three categories: (i) primary/secondary school, (ii) high school, and (iii) university.",782c2c8d-bc10-44f5-ad73-19827ea06246
2,methods2," The physical activity level was assessed through the International Physical Activity Questionnaires (International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ)) [15], which consist of questions regarding five areas on time spent engaged in physical activity in the last week: “high physical activity level” is considered as performing strenuous physical activity on no less than three days, reaching a minimum total physical activity of no less than 1500 MET minutes per week or ≥ seven days of any combination of walking, moderate intensity or vigorous intensity activities reaching a minimum total physical activity of no less than 3000 MET minutes per week, while “moderate physical activity level” is considered as performing ≥ three days of vigorous intensity activity and/or walking of no less than 30 min a day or ≥ five days of moderate intensity activity and/or walking of no less than 30 min a day or ≥ five days of any combination of walking,",4534f80f-6adf-4caa-ade4-90bdda1dc972
3,methods3," moderate intensity or vigorous intensity activities reaching a minimum total physical activity of no less than 600 MET minutes per week. Finally, participants who did not meet the criteria before for either moderate or high levels of physical activity were categorized as having a low physical activity level [15]. Smoking status was divided into three categories: (i) non-smoker, (ii) ex-smoker, and (iii) current smoker.  2.3. Metabolic Outcomes  Anthropometric parameters were carried out according to a standardized protocol [16]. Height was assessed barefoot, with the back square against the wall tape, eyes looking straight ahead, and a right-angled triangle resting on the head and against the wall approximating to the nearest 0.5 cm. Subjects were classified according to body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) categories as under/normal weight (body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m2), overweight (from body mass index (BMI) 25 to 29.9 kg/m2), and obese (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2).",970cc931-34b1-4e33-903a-9278aae86f3b
4,methods4," After 5 min sitting at rest, individual’s arterial blood pressure was checked three times on the right arm with an angle of 45 degrees from the trunk. The mean value of the last two measurements was considered as the final result. Data from measurements were expanded with general practitioners’ digital records, as a specialist diagnoses patients with disease in order to obtain drugs. Subjects were diagnosed with hypertension when the average systolic/diastolic blood pressure value was equal or more than 140/90 mm Hg (in accordance with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH)) guidelines) [17], taking anti-hypertensive medications, or being diagnosed previously as hypertensive. Individuals were considered dyslipidemic or diabetic if diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia/hypertriglyceridemia or diabetes, respectively.  2.4.",c233de50-e2b7-46f1-b816-50ee5b86fdca
5,methods5," Dietary Assessment  Nutritional data were obtained through two food frequency questionnaires (long and short), conceived and before validated for the Sicilian population [18,19]. The Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)s is composed by 110 drink and food items indicative of the diet in the last six months. Subjects enrolled were asked how often they usually had consumed pre-defined serving sizes of foods and beverages present in the Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)s, with a range of nine possible answers from “never” to “4–5 times per day”. Intake of food items characterized by seasonality referred to consumption during the period in which the food was available and then adjusted by its proportional intake over one year.",eca3ff63-9be1-4caa-b7ff-b31e3560ab46
6,methods6," The food consumption was assessed using a constructed database and calculated (in g or mL) by following the standard portion sizes used in the study and then turned into 24-h intake; then, food composition tables from the Italian Research Center for Foods and Nutrition to retrieve the mean content values for macro- and micronutrients contained in the Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)s were used. The nutrient intake from each food was obtained by multiplying the retrieved content by the consumption of each food daily. After the dietary assessment, individuals with unreliable intakes (<1000 or >6000 kcal/day, lacking food items or implausible responses) were excluded, leaving a total of 1936 subjects included in the analyses for the present study.",8618f2cb-8cff-414e-900c-c6e1bf2836e3
7,methods7," The Mediterranean diet adherence was estimated through a literature-based score built weighting all the median (or mean) values for the sample size of selected studies published on Mediterranean diet and health outcomes and then determining a mean value of all the weighted medians; two standard deviations were used to determine three different categories of consumption for each food group for which a score depending whether they are representative of the Mediterranean dietary habits (fruit, vegetables, cereals, legumes, seafood, moderate intake of alcohol) or not (meat, preserved meats and dairy products) was given [20,21].  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated through a validated, literature-based score not considering the consumption of nuts among its criteria [20].",4e80d188-5f2c-4eb0-bc11-e34bc4c71a1b
8,methods8," The score was built reviewing available literature investigating the relationship between Mediterranean diet adherence and health outcomes, and based on the consumption of nine food groups, including fruit, vegetables, cereal grains, legumes, fish and fish products, meat and meat products, dairy products, alcohol intake and olive oil. Higher consumption of peculiar food groups of the Mediterranean diet (fruit, vegetables, cereals, legumes and fish) was given higher points, while higher consumption of food groups not representing it (meat and dairy products) was given lower points. The final adherence score varies from 0 point (lowest adherence) to 18 points (highest adherence) with individuals grouped in tertiles and categorized as low, medium, and high adherent to the Mediterranean diet [21].  2.5.",464ee1bc-d527-4c79-aa57-b3761b4941b9
9,methods9," Time Feeding Assessment  Participants were asked how many meals they had per day and at what time they usually had them during the last six months (including data about breakfast, snacks, lunch and dinner). Consequently, the time between the first and last meal of an average day was determined. Two categorizations for two groups of analyses were used: participants were categorized (1) in those eating within 10 h (time restricted feeding (TRF)-10) vs. those eating over a window of time larger than 10 h (no time restricted feeding (TRF)-10), and (2) in those eating within 8 h (time restricted feeding (TRF)-8) vs. those eating over a window of time larger than 8 h (no time restricted feeding (TRF)-8). These two windows of time were considered in order to test whether there could be some differences when exploring a narrower feeding period.  2.6.",2d3cfa55-7cde-4368-a983-e37ceaadbb54
10,methods10," Statistical Analysis  Differences in distribution of background characteristics, nutrient and food intake by time restricted feeding (TRF) status were assessed to identify potential confounding factors. Categorical variables are expressed as frequencies of occurrence and percentages, while continuous variables are expressed as means and standard deviations (SDs). The chi-squared test was used to assess the differences between groups. The Student’s t-test was used to assess the differences between groups with normally distributed variables, while the Mann–Whitney U test was used for not-normally distributed variables. The association between time restricted feeding (TRF) status and metabolic outcomes was tested through univariate (unadjusted) and multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for baseline characteristics (including age, sex, educational and occupational status, smoking and physical activity status).",b9a6acf0-2666-4d7c-b4e1-a69bed61633e
11,methods11," An additional model was performed further adjusting for the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (as a proxy for diet quality) and having breakfast and dinner. All reported p values were based on two-sided tests and compared to a significance level of 5%. SPSS 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software was used for all the statistical calculations.  3. Results  The main background characteristics of the patients by categories of time feeding are presented in Table 1. The 14.3% (n = 276) and 5.6% (n = 108) of individuals consumed their meals within 10 h (time restricted feeding (TRF)-10) and 8 h (time restricted feeding (TRF)-8), respectively. There was no significant different frequency of time restricted feeding (TRF) between men and women; in contrast, among those categorized as time restricted feeding (TRF)-10 and time restricted feeding (TRF)-8, there were significantly older individuals and a higher percentage of subjects with medium educational and occupational status.",7b274977-2dde-49fe-805b-c974891ae7ee
12,methods12," Additionally, for physical activity, there was a significant difference in the distribution of categories for time restricted feeding (TRF)-8, with a higher proportion of moderately active individuals among those eating within 8 h. When considering health status, there was a significant difference in body mass index (BMI) for individuals consuming their meals within 10 h and 8 h compared to those who did not. Additionally, a significant difference in systolic blood pressure was found, but only among those with feeding restricted to 8 h. In general, no clear trends across categories of the investigated variables have been detected.  Table 2 shows micro- and macronutrients and major food groups consumption across time feeding groups in order to test whether there was any quantitative or qualitative dietary difference between groups.",9395f568-eacd-47b0-813c-aaa29517e13c
13,methods13," There was no different energy intake between either time restricted feeding (TRF)-10 or time restricted feeding (TRF)-8 groups and no time restricted feeding (TRF) groups. In contrast, participants eating in a restricted window of time had significantly lower intake of vitamin C, E and consumed more nuts and dairy products than those with longer feeding time. Moreover, individuals belonging to the time restricted feeding (TRF)-8 group also had a lower intake of fiber, potassium, fruit, legumes, and higher amounts of meat (total).  Table 3 shows the association between time restricted feeding (TRF) and the various metabolic outcomes investigated. After adjustment even for potential confounding factors related to eating habits (including adherence to the Mediterranean diet, having breakfast/dinner), time restricted feeding (TRF)-10 was inversely associated with being overweight/obese (OR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07), hypertension (OR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.45), and dyslipidemias (OR = 0.",c9652f2c-3466-431e-992c-790f56e58308
14,methods14,"26, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.63), while time restricted feeding (TRF)-8 was associated only with being overweight/obese (OR = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.15) and hypertension (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.60). No associations were found with type-2 diabetes.  4. Discussion  In the current study, we investigated the relationship between the time feeding period and various metabolic outcomes in a cohort of Mediterranean adults. There were no clear patterns of association between the feeding window and background variables (besides age) as well as no healthier nutrient/food intake in those individuals with shorter feeding time. However, based on multivariate logistic regression analyses, we observed that individuals consuming their food in a window of time limited to 8 or 10 h were less likely to be obese and overweight, to have hypertension, and those with time restricted feeding (TRF)-10 were also less likely to have dyslipidemias.",6809a6de-e77a-48d0-827f-7f721aeb42b1
15,methods15," Interestingly, individuals with diverse feeding time habits did not differ in total calorie intake, nor other important nutrients that could confound the analyses, suggesting that the plausible effects of time-restricted feeding are not due to energy or nutrient differences between groups.  The effects of a reduction in the time feeding window on body weight and other metabolic outcomes in humans have been studied in only a few studies due to both the novelty of the topic and the difficulty of following a daily life time restricted feeding (TRF) protocol in the case of randomized controlled trials. However, published scientific literature on increasing the temporal fasting window shows results in line with our findings concerning its potential role on body weight and produces comparable, if not superior, weight loss, when compared to continuous caloric restriction [22,23]. Among randomized controlled trials, Gill et al.",d1190f25-c0ad-40f2-8a8a-d0eee0210ed6
16,methods16," [24] investigated the effects of 10-h time restricted feeding (TRF) in overweight adults and reported a 4% weight decrease that was maintained for one year. Findings from other studies [25,26] showed that a 4 to 8 h time feeding window induces a spontaneous calorie restriction and significantly lowered fat mass without changing muscle mass in young resistance-trained men. Another recent study [27] investigated the effects of 12 weeks 8-h time restricted feeding (TRF) protocol (ad libitum food intake, time-limited from 10:00 to 18:00 h) in comparison to a no-intervention historical control group on weight and metabolic disease risk factors in obese patients. They found that time restricted feeding (TRF) patients had a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure and reduction in body weight by ~3% relative to a no-intervention historical control group.",8a0dcb60-8b81-4264-944d-a590efeca490
17,methods17," In this study, body composition, visceral fat mass and metabolic biomarkers (including diastolic blood pressure, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR (Homeostasis-Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance), and homocysteine) were not significantly different from controls. Lowe et al., comparing a consistent meal timing group instructed to eat three structured meals per day and a time restricted feeding (TRF) group instructed to eat ad libitum from 12:00 p.m. until 8:00 p.m., showed that there was a significant decrease in weight in the intervention but not in the control group, nor between groups [28]. Conversely, Sutton [29] and colleagues performed a five-week crossover, randomized, isocaloric- and eucaloric-controlled feeding trial testing 6-h time restricted feeding (TRF) in prediabetic male patients.",58182624-a3af-4bcb-ae7b-9ec549372a21
18,methods18," Interestingly, time restricted feeding (TRF) ameliorates insulin sensitivity, b-cell responsiveness, oxidative stress and blood pressure in prediabetic patients, even though food intake was matched to the control group and no weight loss occurred. Finally, a 12-week non-randomized controlled clinical trial performed in obese women showed that a time restricted feeding (TRF) protocol reduces body weight without changes in metabolic syndrome biomarkers [30]. Overall, the major limitation of these studies relies on general inclusion of a few patients (maximum 40), only short-term interventions (maximum nine weeks) and incomparable meal frequency range (from 1 to 12 meals/day).  Concerning observational studies, a report conducted on 50,660 adult Canadian and US members of Seventh-day Adventist churches showed that changes in body mass index (BMI) were associated with the duration of the overnight fasting window: the longer the overnight fast, the lower the bodyweight [31].",d94e9039-7a03-4f54-add4-ab9d10a04499
19,methods19," A cross-sectional analysis conducted on overweight/obese women who were dependents of active duty and retired military personnel showed that time restricted feeding (TRF) was associated with lower dietary glycemic load, energy intake and meal frequency [32]. Orthodox religious fasting and Ramadan can be also considered forms of time restricted feeding (TRF) since food intake is only allowed at certain times of the day. Some studies showed that time restricted feeding (TRF) associated with Orthodox fasting and Ramadan led to better body composition and a reduced risk of become obese [33,34,35], although other studies reported inconsistent results, often transient and heterogeneous [36,37].",c5e40e0c-8db9-453d-a9ed-9294ed9e0155
20,methods20," However, there are some issues that do not allow to appropriately compare religious fasting to time restricted feeding (TRF) regimens: the light/dark cycle of fasting and eating is often shifted as compared to natural circadian rhythms, the length of fasting window varies depending on geographical location and year, and various implementations of Ramadan fasting exist.  The exact mechanisms by which intermittent fasting and especially time restricted feeding (TRF) can affect human health are still poorly understood, even though considerable progress has been made in our understanding. The fasting period associated with time restricted feeding (TRF) can restore and amplify the peripheral circadian clocks and the transcription rates of clock genes [38,39] that regulate many metabolic pathways, which are altered in metabolic disease and obesity [40,41].",3e505b46-4fa7-445e-8ff8-8b1447f9b50c
21,methods21," Eating in a shorter feeding time window seems to ameliorate the circadian oscillations of the main metabolic regulators, including cAMP response element-binding protein, mammalian target of rapamycin, and AMP-activated protein kinase [42]. Moreover, time restricted feeding (TRF) may play a role in the pathophysiology of obesity through the modulation of the expression of protein chaperones (e.g., heat-shock proteins) and growth factors (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor) that lead both to less oxidative damage and higher stress resistance [43], and, consequently, improved adipose tissue signaling and a lower increase of fat storage [44]. Additionally, a relationship between time restricted feeding (TRF) and gut microbiota has been related to the potential effects on metabolic health through inflammatory and immune-related mechanisms [45].",56bed780-2c22-41ec-908f-396a7260ca56
22,methods22," Finally, although the duration of fasting during a time restricted feeding (TRF) approach does not result in ketosis, if the fasting time window is prolonged (to about 16 h), it is sufficient to activate autophagy [46]. Autophagy is an important intracellular process that has a key role in the cardiovascular system to fight against oxidative stress and to maintain normal cell function [47].  Other metabolic outcomes including hypertension and dyslipidemias were associated with time restricted feeding (TRF) when the analyses were not adjusted for diet quality (evaluated as adherence to the Mediterranean diet) and having breakfast or dinner. Thus, the association between time restricted feeding (TRF) and overall metabolic health outcomes might be confounded by such variables.",042a7fff-55ac-4d62-8c7d-ca318646144e
23,methods23," According to recent scientific literature, these variables may possibly be interconnected: several studies have been published on chronotype and cardio-metabolic outcomes, showing a substantial association of adverse outcomes with evening chronotype [48,49], including having dinner and higher energy intake during the evening [50,51]. Similarly, later chronotype has been also associated with breakfast skipping and both contribute to poorer glycemic control [52]. Concerning diet quality, several studies showed a relationship between higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, morning chronotype, and health outcomes [53,54].",548de929-8ef2-46ba-85ad-c002d5c0886f
24,methods24," Although reducing the feeding time window during the day may be beneficial, shifting food intake to the darkest hours can partially reverse circadian rhythms and have null, if not detrimental, effects on metabolic outcomes; there is a large body of scientific literature showing that individuals consuming a larger daily caloric intake during the evening are more likely to be overweight and obese [55,56,57,58,59,60]; moreover, other studies showed that nocturnal eaters had an increased coronary heart disease risk [61] and reduced insulin sensitivity assessed by HOMA-IR index [62]. Notably, there are also contrasting results reported in the literature and other studies revealed that the time of eating was not predictive of responsiveness to weight loss interventions [63].",a6c87181-7d62-4016-8701-ba4ce7025e81
25,methods25," From a mechanistic point of view, eating in misalignment with circadian clocks may have an impact on hormonal and metabolic homeostasis, particularly glucose tolerance, cortisol levels, and adiponectin fluctuation [64,65,66]. Thus, the time of time restricted feeding (TRF) (i.e., early or late time restricted feeding (TRF)) may result in different outcomes when exploring its association with metabolic health, but as the results are not univocal, they warrant clarification in future studies.  The findings of the current study have to be considered in light of some limitations. First, the cross-sectional design of the study does not permit the definition of a causal relationship but rather an association. Second, data from an Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) may be subject to recall bias. Third, we can only rely on average eating habits, but daily fluctuations of feeding times should be taken into account.",e9d07472-71dd-4bdc-9454-c5d8ed657820
26,methods26," Fourth, we were unable to distinguish early and late time restricted feeding (TRF) due to the low number of individuals included in this category. Fifth, the low number of both individuals having time restricted feeding (TRF) and type-2 diabetes may limit the statistical power for the retrieved lack of association.  5. Conclusions  In conclusion, metabolic disorders could not only be a matter of excess calorie intake but also considered a “chronobiological disease”, suggesting that differences in feeding/fasting duration could play a role in daily habits of the general population. Considering the results of the present study, time-restricted feeding could be implicated in the prevalence of metabolic outcomes such as being overweight/having obesity and having hypertension. However, these findings require further investigation, with studies that are better designed, more controlled, and with a prospective approach.",7290ff66-b121-46d1-adae-a759e0820bc2
27,methods27," Moreover, given the potential importance of distinguishing between early and late time-restricted feeding, it is advised that future studies take into account this variable when exploring the relationship between time restricted feeding (TRF) and metabolic health outcomes.
