2,methods2," Design TEAM-MED is a 12 month pilot parallel group randomised controlled trials (RCT) designed to evaluate the feasibility of a community-based peer support intervention to encourage adoption and maintenance of a MD, in comparison to a proven dietetic-led intervention [8] and a minimal intervention (control group), in adults at high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in Northern Ireland. Ethical approval has been received from the Office for Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (HSC RECA; ref 13/NI/0152) who will also review any changes made to the protocol. The study protocol is registered on ControlledTrials.com (ID no. ISrandomised controlled trials (RCT)N68779848). Informed written consent for study procedures and collection, handling and storage of biological samples will be obtained from all study participants by the study researcher.   An overview of the study design is shown in Figure 1 and a summary is reported using the SPIRIT checklist (Table S1).",fa620c2a-5055-4528-a94d-75c319152177

Participants will be informed of their allocated group by the researcher after baseline data is collected. It will not be possible to blind study researchers or participants to the allocated intervention group, however, laboratory and data analysis and assessment of primary outcome will be carried out by an investigator blinded to treatment allocation.   The three TEAM-MED intervention groups (peer support, dietitian-led support and minimal support) as discussed in Section 2.4, vary in the intensity and nature of support provided to participants to encourage adoption of dietary behaviours consistent with a MD.",c87db3ae-695d-4c5c-b513-6e14fe645010
4,methods4," The target MD behaviours for this study are based on the PREDIMED study [8] adapted for the current population [34] and include: preferential consumption of wholegrain cereal foods, fruits ≥ 2 portions (160 g)/day, vegetables ≥ 3 portions (240 g)/day, olive/rapeseed oils ≥ 4 tbsp. (60 mL)/day and/or Monounsaturated Fatty Acid (Monounsaturated Fatty Acid (MUFA))-rich spreads ≥ 3 tsp. (15 g)/day, nuts ≥ 3 handfuls (90 g)/week, legumes ≥ 3 portions (240 g)/week, fish ≥ 3 servings (420 g)/week, red meat ≤ 2 servings (300 g)/week, processed meat ≤ 1 serving (150 g)/week, confectionary ≤ 3 servings/week, alcohol (if consumed) 125–375 mL ≥ 3 days/week.  The inclusion of rapeseed oil as an alternative to olive oil was a pragmatic decision taken to address specific barriers to olive oil intake e.g., cost, taste and cultural differences in food choice that were identified in our target population [32].",a073c100-0e21-4aa9-8409-2bea3225b523

Specific behaviour change techniques derived from published taxonomies [36,37] are incorporated in each TEAM-MED intervention to promote MD behaviour change, as shown in Table 1. The duration of the intervention is one year and study assessments will be conducted at baseline and at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow up.   2.3. Study Participants 2.3.1. Participant Recruitment We aim to recruit 75 male/female participants aged 40 years or more from hospital outpatient clinics, GP surgeries and the general population. Potential participants will attend a dedicated research facility at Queen’s University Belfast for a 45-min screening appointment conducted by a study researcher.",d3f3cd21-0048-43aa-8e13-1907ed1a2d28

Peer Supporters Peer supporters (lay participants and/or community health workers) will be recruited from the general public and from local community networks, volunteer websites and health centres. Two peer supporters will be allocated to each group formed within the peer support intervention. It is envisaged that one peer supporter will have been successful in making positive changes to their diet and the other will be familiar with community networks and group facilitation.",79985a1f-6b89-4ed4-b539-285964eeeb72
8,methods8," Potential peer supporters will undergo study eligibility screening similar to that described for study participants above, and an additional screening interview, conducted by two members of the study team, to determine their suitability and commitment to deliver the peer support intervention. In total, 12 peer supporters will be recruited and trained, which is more than required to successfully deliver the proposed intervention. However, access to a pool of trained peer supporters will allow any setbacks in study implementation to be quickly addressed, for example, withdrawal of peer supporters from the study.  2.3.5. Peer Supporter Training TEAM-MED peer supporters will attend two full training days delivered by qualified experts in dietary behaviour change and group facilitation skills. The training aims to equip peer supporters with knowledge (e.g., MD components, role of a peer supporter and behavioural strategies to support dietary change), confidence (e.g.",ee964273-d9fe-43ad-b0aa-8194f8a80766

Peer support training will be interactive and informal, with emphasis on the provision of social support to encourage positive dietary change. An outline of peer supporter training components is shown in Table 2. Peer supporters will complete a knowledge questionnaire post-training, which will be used to determine individual competence to deliver the peer support intervention. A certificate will be given to those peer supporters who are successful in completing the training course (>75% questionnaire score). If competency to deliver the intervention is not achieved at this stage, further training will be offered to peer supporters via refresher day training and competency will be reassessed by administering the post-training questionnaire (as outlined above).  2.3.6.",65a2c796-fb43-4c0e-8bae-bf5aa568051d

A detailed training manual (‘TEAM-MED peer supporter manual’) will be provided to support delivery of the group intervention. The study team will promote ongoing communication between paired peer supporters to plan individual roles for group session delivery. Peer supporters will receive one scheduled telephone call from a researcher after individual group sessions to discuss any challenges or difficulties they may have experienced. In addition, all trained peer supporters will have an opportunity to meet as a group on at least one occasion during the intervention period, where informal discussion and sharing of experiences will be encouraged. Peer supporters will not be formally paid for their role but will receive reimbursement of travel costs incurred to deliver the intervention.",3fe5f582-2efa-406b-8522-36972bb855c4

Participants allocated to this intervention will be scheduled to attend a group programme delivered by two trained peer supporters comprising 11 group sessions over the 12-month period. Groups will involve up to 10 study participants who will meet in a convenient community setting, such as a private room in a community centre. Each group session is expected to last up to 2-h and will include a brief (10–15 min) MD and/or behavioural education component delivered by peer supporters and designed to provide a focus for group discussion.",e72e709a-154f-4921-814a-8151d7ee1473
12,methods12," The group topics include: ‘health benefits of a MD’, ‘changing fat intake’, ‘eating more wholegrain’ and ‘eating a seasonal MD’. Practical food demonstrations (via food tasting sessions) are included in four group sessions. A personal weigh-in and blood pressure measurement will be available in each session, with feedback offered by a peer supporter. Participants will be supported with written MD educational materials, suggested meal plans, shopping lists and seasonal recipe books developed specifically for the study to support MD behaviour change. In addition, a personal workbook will be given to participants at the beginning of the group programme to facilitate dietary goal-setting and self-monitoring of personal dietary goals. Participants are encouraged to maintain contact with other group members and peer supporters between sessions (via telephone, text messaging and/or face-to-face meetings) to promote social support and group cohesion.  2.4.2.",1e3fb4fe-bf30-4907-b6f6-1512f98b16b6
13,methods13," Group 2: Dietitian-Led Support (n = 25) The dietitian-led intervention is based on that reported in the PREDIMED trial and shown to be effective in achieving increased adherence to a MD [8]. At baseline, participants will attend an individual face-to-face 90-min motivational interview with a study dietitian. Personal MD dietary goals will be agreed and participants will receive written MD educational materials, suggested meal plans, shopping lists and seasonal recipes identical to those suggested to those in the other intervention groups. Participants will also be given key MD foods for daily consumption based on their personal preference for either:50 mL extra virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) or,  30 g nuts (15 g walnuts, 7.5 g almonds and 7.5 g hazelnuts) or,  Combination of both (25 mL extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) plus 15 g nuts (8 g walnuts, 3.5 g almonds and 3.",fb22be2e-e0b0-4ccb-92b2-6048fea75a14

The four group session topics are: ‘changing to a MD’, ‘enjoying fruit and vegetables’, ‘eating more wholegrain’ and ‘continuing to eat a MD’. Seasonal recipe books, suggested meal plans and shopping lists will be discussed at each session. The dietitian will then provide an individual 15-min progress review and feedback after each group session. Throughout the intervention period, and between group sessions, participants will have unlimited telephone/email contact with the dietitian for on-going support to optimise compliance with the intervention.  2.4.3.

Results 3.1. Outcomes TEAM-MED will evaluate feasibility of the peer support intervention, in comparison to different methods of providing dietary support, to change dietary behaviour toward a MD. Target behaviour change for the intervention is defined as a ≥ 3-point increase in Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) from baseline to 6 months (adoption) as this change is likely to be both achievable by the target population [15] and clinically important [40]. We will also evaluate change in Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) from 6 to 12 months i.e., maintenance of MD behavioural changes.  The variability data on change in Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in response to the peer support intervention from baseline to 6 months will inform the sample size for a larger study.",b43e34c7-01da-4776-aff1-59bd84fa4766

Possible mediators of MD behaviour change in response to the intervention will also be explored as well as contextual factors that could influence implementation of the intervention or moderate the study outcomes.  TEAM-MED will determine recruitment and retention rates, evaluate data collection methods for outcomes and assess participant acceptability of the peer support intervention and acceptability of changing dietary behaviour towards a MD.

24,methods24," However, we were able to calculate likely power for the study using data generated in a previous intervention trial of patients with existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) [15]. Based on the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) changes in the behavioural counselling group of that trial, that showed standard deviations of 1.3 from baseline to 6 months, a study of 25 subjects per group would have approximately 90% power to detect a difference between treatment groups in mean Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) change from baseline to 6 months of 1.4 units. This assumes a 30% dropout rate during the study period. Corresponding standard deviation for vitamin C change (which is an indicator of fruit and vegetable intake and therefore may be one biomarker associated with adherence to the MD) is 13.9 µmol/L and the difference in mean vitamin C change that could be detected with approximately 90% power is 15 µmol/L.",1a75a3a2-6021-46ac-9dba-b6ac23b5f171

To determine intervention group differences in repeated Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and other end-point measures generated by the study, we will use statistical techniques appropriate for longitudinal data analysis e.g., linear mixed effects models. Initial examination of the correlation structure of the repeated measures will help identify significant interactions between potential confounders and guide model fitting. Linear models will be adjusted for covariates where appropriate and both unadjusted and adjusted models will be presented. The difference in means will provide an estimate of the effect of intervention and 95% confidence limits will be calculated to indicate its precision.

Discussion Supporting adoption and maintenance of a healthy diet such as the MD, which has been shown to effectively reduce the risk of disease, should be a high public health priority for disease prevention. Most trials evaluating the health impacts of a MD have been conducted in Mediterranean countries. One exception is the MedLey study in older Australians that demonstrated improved cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (blood pressure, triglycerides, and F2-isoprostanes) as well as greater flow-mediated dilatation [57,58] after a 6-month MD intervention.",78c4174e-5809-4c44-83cb-a5a8ff64e7ff
28,methods28," Dietary behaviour change was achieved in this study using intensive methods: dietetic consultations and motivational interviewing at 3 and 6 months and every fortnight in between, provision of written educational materials, sample menus and recipes, a daily food checklist to help track compliance with the diet and provision of key foods [59]. While these findings indicate that behaviour change towards a MD is achievable with a health professional led intervention in a non-Mediterranean population, there is still much to learn regarding the most cost-effective approaches to support MD behaviour change [60], and particularly, interventions to support longer-term maintenance of newly adopted MD behaviours in non-Mediterranean countries.",fcea5ff5-6c3b-4e2f-80fc-734089e42a37
29,methods29," This paper describes the protocol for the TEAM-MED trial to explore feasibility of a developed peer support intervention for dietary behaviour change towards a MD, compared to another more intensive method of support, in Northern Europeans at high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The intervention has been developed using a theory-based approach and is tailored to the needs of the target group to promote dietary behaviour change. TEAM-MED benefits from including a range of objective and subjective measures of diet adherence over 12 months, which will help to determine adoption and maintenance of dietary behaviours consistent with a MD. TEAM-MED also incorporates a comprehensive evaluation plan to determine acceptability and fidelity of intervention implementation and will explore potential important mediators of dietary change in the population and these methods will be more comprehensively described in a separate paper.   5.",fb1c9b1a-ab0d-4d0a-815a-7a5cee91854d
