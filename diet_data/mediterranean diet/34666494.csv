0,methods0," 2.1. Participants  The research involved both the Oncology Center G. Paolo II of P.O. Vito Fazzi of Lecce (Apulia, Italy) and the Laboratory of Cognitive and Psychophysiological Olfactory Processes of University of Salento. Onco-geriatric metastatic patients (mean age 78 ± 5.6) were recruited and subdivided as follows: 70 (Group 1; 30 women) treated with chemotherapy, 43 with immunotherapy (Group 2; 10 women) and 41 geriatric control subjects (Group 3; 22 women). All the patients followed palliative cares and suffered from neoplastic pathologies (i.e., gastrointestinal and lung cancer). The patients recruited underwent only chemotherapy or immunotherapy; they did not carry out any other type of treatment. They had not been the subject of either radiotherapy or surgery. They had not undergone neo-adjuvant treatments. The experimental study was approved by the Vito Fazzi AUSL LE Ethical Committee and by the IRB of DiSTeBA, University of Salento.  2.2.",8fe29a77-d421-40f4-9654-3cf904a612b6
1,methods1," Assessment  The Mini Mental State Examination was used as a screening tool to evaluate the possible presence of cognitive impairment. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) [70,71] is a 30-items test that allows for the assessment of some of the main cognitive areas, i.e., spatial and temporal orientation, memory skills (such as words recording and recall), attention, calculus, language and constructive praxis. Scores above the cut-off (22) indicate the absence of impairments. The test was used for research purposes and not to make diagnosis within specific nosological criteria.  The olfactory evaluation was carried out by The Sniffin’ Sticks Screening 12 (MediSense—http://www.medi-sense.eu) (accessed on 12 July 2021). The test consists of 12 odor pens and distinguishes anosmics and hyposmics from normosmics. The purpose of the test is to identify the aromas presented, and the patients are offered four options to choose from.",01a24eef-1952-409a-afaa-2973d9c0df18
2,methods2," The total score, which is higher for normal olfactory abilities, is compared to the age-related normative values.  The G8 test was used as a screening tool for geriatric assessment. This test includes seven items that measure appetite, weight loss, body mass index, motricity, self-related health, medication, cognition and depression [72]. The total score ranges from 0 to 17 (cut-off 14), where lower results represent greater frailty. The G8 is a simple and rapid instrument for identifying patients with a geriatric risk profile [73] and, even if it has a poor specificity, it presents one of the highest sensitivities for frailty [74].  Finally, a validated questionnaire on the evaluation of the adherence of the Mediterranean diet was administered in which lower values indicate higher non-adherence [75].  2.3. Statistical Analysis  JASP 0.16.1 software (University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was used for statistical data analysis.",5b1dd938-2868-435c-89b4-5e222f7bb727
3,methods3," A 2 × 4 multivariate ANOVA design was used in order to explore the influence of the type of therapy and gender (independent variables) on the scores obtained from the various tests (dependent variables). In addition, a correlation analysis was performed between all tests by Pearson’s coefficient. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.  3. Results  MANOVA results showed significant differences related to gender (p < 0.001; Table 1). In particular, output from individual ANOVA per dependent variable (i.e., for each single test) resulting from the same analysis highlighted a significant effect for sex in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (p < 0.001; F 13.618; Table 2, Figure 1), and a similar trend has been observed in G8 (p = 0.054; F 3.785; Table 2, Figure 2).  No significant difference related to gender was observed from the Sniffin’ Sticks Test or from the questionnaire on the evaluation of the adherence of the Mediterranean diet (Sniffin’ Sticks: p = 0.485; F 0.",11ad63e0-644f-44e0-9f89-40772b2decb3
4,methods4,"490; Mediterranean diet: p = 0.202; F 1.642; Table 2).  Regarding the significant gender effect on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the trend on the G8, it was possible that men (Group 1) obtained higher scores both on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (men Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) = 24.963; SD 3.154; women Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 23.587; SD 3.151; Table 3) and on G8 (men G8 = 14.011; SD 2.265; women G8 = 13.452; SD 2.317; Table 3). These results are in direction of a higher frailty for women.  Moreover, the results highlighted a significant effect for therapy on the Sniffin’ Sticks Test (p = 0.050; F (1,2) = 3.054, Table 2). Patients treated with chemotherapy (Group 1) and control subjects (Group 3) showed higher scores than subjects treated with immunotherapy (Group 2) (Group 1: SNIFFING 6.729; SD 2.153; Group 2: SNIFFING 5.791; SD 2.356; Group 3: SNIFFING 6.854; SD 2.424; Table 2 and Table 4, Figure 3).",08f33134-48b2-4351-82d0-5f9d7221021d
5,methods5," This trend of data indicates a higher incidence of anosmia in immunotherapy patients. No differences related to the type of therapy emerged from Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), G8 or the questionnaire on the evaluation of the adherence of the Mediterranean diet. The descriptive analysis for each test in each group are reported in Table 4.  Concerning the correlation analysis (see Table 5, Figure 4), a significant relationship was found between Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and olfactory performance (r = 0.226; p = 0.005), as well as between Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the frailty measure on G8 (r = 0.163; p = 0.045). The higher correlation was found between the Sniffin’ Sticks and G8 (r = 0.279; p = <0.001).  4.",c49724c0-03f0-4279-9699-abd0abff8235
6,methods6," Discussion  Frailty could include concepts such as the dependence and the risk of dependence of the elderly patient on others, the presence of complex medical, psychosocial conditions, chronic disease, important disabilities, weakness, weight loss and decreased physical activity [76,77]. Therefore, geriatric evaluation in the oncological field allows for the development of an integrated and coordinated individual treatment plan that can take into consideration the medical, psychosocial and functional aspects of the elderly person. Hence, the geriatric assessment examines a series of domains that have a particular impact on the quality of life of the elderly person, i.e., physical functionality, the presence of comorbidities, polypharmacy, nutrition, cognitive function and psychological status. So, this assessment is able to influence the decision-making process for cancer treatments and the management of these patients [78,79,80,81].",69723d5a-759d-4f80-a80e-9361007b97b7
7,methods7," The evaluation of all of these aspects represents an opportunity to improve the support and the rehabilitation of the elderly. Furthermore, the literature reports how chemotherapy can have repercussions on specific cognitive abilities in patients treated with this therapy [8]. Furthermore, changes in olfactory perception are more frequent in older cancer patients [82], for whom a change in diet, a great reduction in appetite and food appreciation, poor nutritional status, changes in weight and greater risk of chronic diseases has been reported [49]. Olfactory abilities seem to decrease especially during chemotherapy treatment, and they appear to resolve a few months after the end of chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the impact and the influence of chemosensory changes on the patient’s nutritional status and quality of life should not be underestimated [82,83]. This framework seems to get worse when the olfactory deficits are connected to impaired taste perception [84].",6bbfc888-c07b-43d9-967a-f6c8a38fa0d3
8,methods8," Many describe a gradual process of deterioration and impoverishment of the chemosensory functions, although they are unable to specify the exact moment that it started [85]. The degree of the distress it causes, as well as the impact on daily life, tends to vary based on gender [86]. However, despite this, the present study shows that the scores obtained by the patients treated with chemotherapy in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) did not differ significantly from those of the control group and those who underwent immunotherapy. As for the latter, some immunotherapeutic agents can have negative consequences on the cognitive system causing fatigue and the manifestation of psychiatric symptoms [39,40]. Even in this case, immunotherapy does not appear to significantly affect the cognitive performance of patients compared to either the control group or the group of patients treated with chemotherapy. One possible explanation is provided by Hutchinson and colleagues [87].",04ecde93-8b1e-4578-9ffa-b9527ad061b7
9,methods9," Indeed, it has been found that, through subjective measurements of the deficit (self-reports, questionnaires, etc.), cancer patients often report memory or multitasking difficulties during daily activities.  5. Conclusions  Our study indicates that immunotherapy, assessed through the classical neuropsychological screening, does not affect cognitive domain, even if self-reported measures showed a stronger compromission. These perceptions could be related to quality of life, anxiety, depression and fatigue, since the assessments performed using neuropsychological batteries show a less prevalent cognitive deterioration than that detected by the self-reports. Olfactory perception, on the other hand, seems to be significantly influenced by the type of therapy to which one is subjected. In fact, patients treated with chemotherapy and the control group performed significantly better than those treated with immunotherapy.",00e678ca-58a7-4fee-96c0-b405ee9e9f1a
10,methods10," The literature shows that, in particular, chemotherapy, as a non-selective systemic treatment, in addition to acting on cancer cells, also acts on rapidly growing non-cancerous cells, such us mucous membranes and olfactory and gustatory receptors [83]. Indeed, the subjects in the control group scored higher in the olfactory identification test, but the significant difference was found when they were compared to the patients with immunotherapy.  A significant gender effect was found on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and a trend was observed on the G8 scores. As for the former, men scored higher regardless of the group they belonged to. Indeed, the literature has shown that women’s mean Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores decrease significantly faster with age than those of men [88].",1f5e365f-f6fb-436b-996e-cb5f74bddc29
11,methods11," The same trend was observed in the scores obtained by the women on the G8, in contrast with some studies that point out no gender risk factor for functional disability in the elderly [89]. Nevertheless, research by Sentandreu-Mañó and colleagues [90] highlights some manifestations of frailty that may differ by gender. For example, female sex was associated with lower physical and psychological quality of life. Furthermore, our results from correlation analysis, albeit of an exploratory nature, show how frailty measures are related to cognitive and olfactory abilities and that the latter two are correlated. This suggests that the olfactory assessment could be used as a very simple and sensitive tool for onco-geriatric patients manifesting cognitive complaints [56,57].",b60ff5bd-2f15-4ec7-a999-2b1f334f49ed
12,methods12," Such an approach might be useful in the future for validating patients’ experiences of changes and alterations due to cancer and its treatments, potentially avoiding in some cases the burdensome administration of neuropsychological tests which can also run into cases of underestimation. Limitations of the study include the small sample size and the use of a single test for evaluating cognitive functions. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic did not allow us to recruit other subjects and continue research. This research reveals some future possibilities. Indeed, it might be worth analyzing how chemotherapy and immunotherapy affect olfactory perception with other neuroimaging instruments (e.g., EEG). Furthermore, in the future, the possible presence of cognitive deficits could be assessed with further sensorial, behavioral, cognitive and psychophysiological analyses in clinical aging.",630bb661-c956-41ee-8569-c140a61d6ecf
13,methods13," In this way it could be confirmed whether only gender or olfactory impairment can be considered as risk factors (i.e., gender and sex) or as a biomarker (i.e., olfactory impairment) in cognitive abilities in the geriatrics population undergoing anticancer treatments.
