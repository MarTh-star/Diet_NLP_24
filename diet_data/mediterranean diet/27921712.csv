Participants were recruited from the Food4Me study (www.food4me.org) between 2012 and 2014 [16]. In total, 5562 participants registered for the study (n = 2780 did not meet the inclusion criteria) and 1607 were randomised into the trial (n = 1175 excluded due to sample size being met); a further 127 dropped out prior to completing the first measurements. Exclusion criteria included absence of consent, a self-reported medically prescribed diet in the past three months, or presence of a condition likely to alter dietary requirements e.g., Crohn’s disease, coeliac disease, type-II diabetes, food allergy/intolerance, pregnancy, or lactation.  2.2.",c4ecfc6d-6b6b-489b-a568-bbcaf36a2f6f
1,methods1," Study Design The six-month Food4Me randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted by research centres in seven European Union (EU) countries: University College Dublin, Ireland, University of Reading, UK, Maastricht University, Netherlands, University of Navarra, Spain, Harokopio University, Greece, National Food and Nutrition Institute, Poland, and Technische Universität München, Germany. The randomised controlled trial (RCT) was designed to assess the impact of varying levels of personalised dietary advice on behaviour change and emulated a web-delivered personalised nutrition (PN) service. Participants were randomised to receive (i) standard dietary guidelines; (ii) PN based on individual diet and PA; (iii) PN based on diet, metabolic phenotype and PA; or, iv) PN based on diet, metabolic phenotype, genotype, and PA. The study was conducted online to emulate a real-life PN scenario. Further study details are published elsewhere [16,17].

Ethical approval for the study was granted at each centre and digital informed consent was obtained prior to participation.  In the present analysis, we use baseline data only. At baseline (m0), study participants received a welcome pack via post containing a dried blood spot (dried blood spot (DBS)) collection kit (Vitas Ltd, Oslo, Norway), an Isohelix SK-1 DNA buccal swab kit (LCG Genomics, Hertfordshire, UK), a TracmorD tri-axial accelerometer (Philips Consumer Lifestyle, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; http://www.directlife.philips.com), a measuring tape, and standardized instructions for completion of measurements. On the allocated study day, participants completed the validated Food4Me food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) [18,19] and Baecke PA questionnaire [20,21,22].",20127c50-670d-4215-be83-634c211f2baf
3,methods3," Participants were also instructed to collect dried blood spot (DBS) (following an 8-h fast) and buccal samples, and to measure their height (m), weight (kg) and WC (cm), according to standard procedures. Detailed instructions on how to perform the measurements were provided in printed and digital (i.e., video) format in the languages of each of the seven recruitment countries. WHtR ratio was calculated as WC/height. The TracmorD tri-axial accelerometer [23] was worn for the entire duration of the study, and data were uploaded online by participants on a bi-weekly basis.",4e28a4f4-31aa-4f0b-bd95-857ddeb51e01
4,methods4," Objective physical activity, derived from the accelerometer, was recorded over a two-week period as daily physical activity level (physical activity levels (PAL)), defined as the ratio of total energy expenditure to basal metabolic rate, and time (minutes/day) spent in different intensities of PA, comprising minutes of sedentary behaviours (SB), light (light (LPA)), moderate (moderate (MPA)), and vigorous (vigorous (VPA)) PA; see [24] for detailed methods.  2.3. Dietary Assessment The semi-quantitative validated Food4Me food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) included questions on the consumption (frequency and portion size) of 157 food items during the past month [18,19]. Frequency of consumption was assessed by users selecting one of the following options: never or less than once a month, 1–3 times a month, once a week, 2–4 times a week, 5–6 times per week, once a day, 2–3 times per day, 4–5 times per day, and 6+ times per day.",f1a95cf1-b4fc-4d79-ac65-190c445efe49
5,methods5," Food portion size was estimated using photographs representing small, medium, and large portions; participants could select from these images or the following written portion sizes: very small, small/medium, medium/large, or very large. Food intake (g/day) was calculated by multiplying frequency by portion size. Participants received instructions on how to fill in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) prior to completing it [18].  2.4. Biochemical Analysis At baseline (m0), participants collected 10 blood spots on two dried blood spot (DBS) cards (approximately 150 μL blood per card [25]). Following collection, the blood spots were dried at room temperature for 2–4 h, and placed in a sealed aluminium bag (Whatman Foil Bags, item No. 10534321, Whatman Inc., Sanford, ME, USA) containing a drying sachet (Sorb-it, item No. 10548234, Süd-Chemie, Munich, Germany). dried blood spot (DBS) cards were posted back to research centres and subsequently shipped to Vitas (Vitas Ltd.",3d48155e-e55d-4956-8bcb-03f89a23ecd7

The remaining three food groups: (10) refined grains; (11) sodium; and, (12) empty energy (i.e., energy from solid fats, alcohol, and added sugars), assess dietary components that should be consumed in moderation (reverse scoring). The maximum points allocated to each item varies (fruit and vegetable, and protein components, five points; empty energy, 20 points; remainder, 10 points) and the 12 components are summed to yield a total maximum score of 100 [5].

Alternate Healthy Eating Index (Ahei) The AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) is a 14-component scoring system comprising of seven food items: (1) fruit; (2) vegetables; (3) whole grains; (4) sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice; (5) nuts/legumes; (6) red/processed meat and (7) alcohol and 4 nutrients: (8) trans fatty acids; (9) polyunsaturated fatty acids; (10) long-chain omega-3 fatty acids; and, (11) sodium. Limits for whole grains (g) and alcohol (g) are differentiated according to sex. Sodium is scored according to classification into deciles of intake (mg/day). Components are weighted equally (10 points per item) and are summed to yield a maximum score of 110 [8].  2.5.3.

Alcoholic beverage intake was scored using a non-monotonic scale, with 0 points attributed to an intake of 0 or >700 mL. The maximum score is 55 [12].  2.5.5. Dutch Healthy Diet Index (Dhdi) The Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) is a 10-component continuous score based on 10 Dutch Guidelines for Healthy Diet 2006 [14].",8fcdf19e-a0b2-43e6-94c9-bb4ac7da69be

Minimum (threshold value) and maximum scores (cut-off value) are defined for each item with those ‘recommended’ given a threshold value of 0. and foods (ADF) were defined as foods and beverages that contain easily fermentable sugars and drinks that are high in food acids; this component was scored dichotomously (0, >seven occasions per day; 10 ≥ 7 occasions per day) [15].  2.6. Statistical Analysis Data are shown as means ± SD. Outcome variables were checked for normal distribution and skewed data were normalised using Log10 (omega-3 index) and square root (TC) transformations.",10d5b9ac-a6a4-4dad-9138-f1e21f066daf
12,methods12," The differences in Diet quality scores (DQS) between countries were assessed using general linear models, which were adjusted for age and sex (where significant), with post-hoc Bonferroni testing. To assess the association between Diet quality scores (DQS) and markers of cardiometabolic risk, diet scores were separated into quintiles. Linear models were then used to assess trends across quintiles of diet score and body mass index (BMI), WC, WHtR, dried blood spot (DBS) TC, carotenoids and omega-3 index, and PA at baseline. Associations between diet scores were evaluated using Pearson’s Rank correlation coefficient. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were analysed using STATA version 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).  3. Results Data from 1480 participants (41.6% males) were included in the present analysis, as shown in Table 1. According to body mass index (BMI), participants were classified as overweight (≥25 kg/m2).",35e54877-ff87-447f-8e9c-fec0667d1f3f
13,methods13," Men (n = 615) had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) than women (n = 865), as reported previously [16], and a significantly higher WC and WHtR (p < 0.001). Mean WC exceeded the recommended cut-off (>80 cm) in females only, indicating abdominal obesity [32]. Although physical activity levels (PAL), SB, and light (LPA) did not differ between sexes, men engaged in higher amounts of moderate and vigorous PA (p < 0.001). Blood spot TC (p < 0.001) was higher in men, whereas blood carotenoid concentrations were higher in women (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in omega-3 index between the sexes. Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) scores were significantly higher for women than for men (p < 0.001). Further socio-demographic characteristics were published previously [31].  Correlations between the Diet quality scores (DQS) ranged from 0.31 to 0.63 (p < 0.001) (Table 2).",8ffac940-0d8d-44e9-88ec-afeffa705f72
14,methods14," The weakest correlation was between the Mediterranean-type diet scores, MedDietScore (MDS) and P-MedDietScore (MDS), and strongest between the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI).  The association between quintiles of Diet quality scores (DQS) and food and nutrient intakes are shown in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Diet quality scores (DQS) were positively associated with intakes of fruit, vegetables, wholegrain, low fat dairy, and oily fish, and negatively associated with full-fat dairy (p’s trend < 0.05). With the exception of the Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI), scores were also negatively associated with red meat intake (p’s trend < 0.05). Total dairy consumption was associated with higher Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) scores only (p < 0.001).",08e5080b-884e-42f6-80e1-240879654c6b

Except for the MedDietScore (MDS), scores were negatively associated with total fat intake and salt intake (p trends < 0.05). MUFA intake was positively associated with all Diet quality scores (DQS), except for the AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) (p trends < 0.05). For carbohydrate, higher intakes were associated with better scores in the AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) (p trends < 0.001), and lower scores in the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and P-MedDietScore (MDS) (p trends < 0.05). The AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), P-MedDietScore (MDS), and Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) were all positively associated with total sugar intake (p trends < 0.001).",a735fddf-01a4-4af2-bbfd-6f5206cae16a

Lastly, calcium intake was positively associated with the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), and Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) (p trends < 0.005), but not the Mediterranean-type Diet quality scores (DQS).  3.1.

17,methods17," Overall, there was a tendency towards higher US-type diet-quality scores (Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI)) in Northern EU countries and towards higher Mediterranean-type scores (MedDietScore (MDS) and P-MedDietScore (MDS)) in Southern EU countries. Poland had the lowest score across all the indices. Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) scores were highest in the UK and Netherlands, although these did not significantly differ from Spain, Ireland, and Greece. AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) scores in the UK and Netherlands were significantly higher than in Greece and Spain (p’s < 0.05).  Spain had the highest P-MedDietScore (MDS) score, which was significantly higher than for all other centres (all p’s < 0.001 except for UK; p = 0.024). Poland had a significantly lower P-MedDietScore (MDS) than all other centres, except Germany (p < 0.001).

The countries with the highest Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) were Spain, the UK, and Netherlands, which all had significantly higher Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) scores than Germany, Poland, and Greece (p’s < 0.005).  3.2. Association between Diet-Quality Scores and Markers of Cardiometabolic Risk The association between quintiles of Diet quality scores (DQS), physical characteristics (age, body mass index (BMI), WHtR, and TC) and dried blood spot (DBS) markers are shown in Table 3 (as Q1, Q3, and Q5). Higher Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), MedDietScore (MDS), and P-MedDietScore (MDS) scores, and thus diet quality, were associated with greater age (p’s trend < 0.001), total carotenoids (p trends < 0.05) and omega-3 index (p trends < 0.01), and lower body mass index (BMI) (p trends < 0.01), WC (p trends < 0.05) and WHtR (p trends < 0.01).",6612f07e-a5bd-45e0-ac22-89a3ed66c7b3
19,methods19," Very similar body mass index (BMI) and WHtR were observed across quintiles of the MedDietScore (MDS) and P-MedDietScore (MDS). For carotenoids and omega-3 index, the greatest difference between quintiles (Q5-Q1) was observed for the AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) (0.53 µM) and P-MedDietScore (MDS) (1.00), respectively. There was no association between Diet quality scores (DQS)s and TC.  Table 4 shows the association between quintiles of Diet quality scores (DQS) and PA (physical activity levels (PAL) and minutes of SB, light PA, moderate PA, and vigorous PA). Higher daily physical activity levels (PAL) and vigorous PA and lower SB were associated with higher Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), P-MedDietScore (MDS), and Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) indices (p trend < 0.05). MedDietScore (MDS)s were not associated with physical activity levels (PAL), yet trends for higher vigorous PA (p trend < 0.001) and lower SB (p trend = 0.004) were observed.",fa4a858c-55ee-4f7e-97be-a5d232a2fec1

Discussion We observed a tendency for Northern EU countries to exhibit higher Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) scores, whereas Spain displayed significantly higher Mediterranean-type Diet quality scores (DQS). All of the Diet quality scores (DQS)s showed inverse associations with adiposity indexes, and positive associations with dried blood spot (DBS) total carotenoids and blood omega-3-index. Significant associations between Diet quality scores (DQS) and objective PA scores were also observed.  4.1.",0cf42daf-e710-439e-bf0b-48c7deaa9761
21,methods21," Diet Quality Scores across Europe Significantly higher MedDietScore (MDS) and P-MedDietScore (MDS) scores were observed in Spain, whereas participants in Northern-EU countries, predominantly following a Western diet, scored higher using the US-type Diet quality scores (DQS) (Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI)). This is expected given that the MedDietScore (MDS) and P-MedDietScore (MDS) were developed in Southern-EU and based on dietary patterns in this region, as observed previously in the Spanish Food4Me cohort [33].  Correlations between Diet quality scores (DQS) were greatest between the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) (r = 0.63). The Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) scores also displayed a strong correlation (r = 0.62), similar to that reported in the 1990 Nurses’ Health study (n = 660; r = 0.60) [34], and the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort (men, n = 243,321, r = 0.",9b28ebc8-dca7-4897-9c92-b568043bc743
22,methods22,"62; women n = 182,342, r = 0.55) [35]. Correlations between the AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and Mediterranean-type scores (aMED) in the aforementioned studies ranged from 0.49–0.75, which are higher than that observed in our study (range 0.35–0.51 between MedDietScore (MDS)/P-MedDietScore (MDS) and Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI)/AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI)). However, contrary to the P-MedDietScore (MDS) and MedDietScore (MDS), which are based on epidemiological data from Southern Europe, the nine-component aMED was adapted for use in American populations [34]; thus, a stronger correlation may be expected.  4.2. Comparison with Previous Work Mean Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) scores in the 1990 Nurses’ Health study were 77 (SD 11) and 43 (SD 11), respectively [34]; the opposite pattern was observed in the Food4Me Study (Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), 49; AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), 64).",4ef841ea-65dd-4a90-ba2c-e82c716a746a
23,methods23," However, similar to findings in the present study, these Diet quality scores (DQS) scores were negatively associated with body mass index (BMI) across quintiles of Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) (p’s ≤ 0.05), and are positively associated with PA (p’s < 0.004) [34]. In the third NHANES cohort, the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) was a strong independent positive predictor of all carotenoids (p < 0.00001) and negative predictor of body mass index (BMI), plasma glucose, and HbA1c (n = 8719) [36], with associations also being observed between the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and overweight [6]. In Food4Me, none of the Diet quality scores (DQS)s were associated with TC, which was also the case for the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) in NHANES. Scores inversely associated with serum cholesterol (p < 0.",8c15bc67-b9cb-495d-9614-70993be3e3e8
24,methods24,"03) in the NHANES cohort included the Recommended Food Score and Dietary Diversity Score for Recommended Foods [36], which were not explored in our present analysis. Similarly, in the SU.VI.MAX cohort (n = 5081), higher Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) scores were associated with healthier lifestyles and body mass index (BMI) in men (weak association), but not plasma lipids [7].  Low total plasma carotenoids have been reported as an independent predictor of mortality in community-dwelling adults (n = 1043) aged > 65 years [37]. In a case-control study of diet and breast cancer, higher Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) scores were associated with higher plasma carotenoids in women (n = 340) [38]. We also observed high dried blood spot (DBS) total carotenoids in the upper (5th) quartiles of Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) (1.76 µM) and AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) (1.81 µM) in our study (>1.",97f49ece-305c-48d8-864e-3d321e973ac0
25,methods25,"8 µmol/L recommended and considered ‘ideal’ in Food4Me); which is likely to reflect the ‘fruit’ and ‘vegetable’ components of the Diet quality scores (DQS). Plasma total carotenoids (excluding lycopene) have been highly correlated with total fruit and vegetable intake previously [39]. Mean dried blood spot (DBS) total carotenoids in the Food4Me Study (1.52 µmol/L), were comparable to ranges reported previously in Scandinavian cohorts (1.24–1.86 µmol/L) [40] and the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (n = 3043 from nine EU countries) [41].  Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) scores in the Food4Me Study (66.5 and 66.6 for men and women, respectively) were slightly higher than those that were reported in the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey (Dutch National Food Consumption Survey (DNFCS)) (n = 749): 57.8 for men and 60.4 for women (p = 0.002) [14].",61032eb8-324b-4049-ada8-5dead4e25b53
26,methods26," Folate intake (adjusted for energy) was positively associated with the Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) in both the DHFCS and Food4Me cohorts [14]. In the DHFCS cohort, a lack of variation in the acidic food and drink (and foods (ADF)) component was observed (SD = 1.8), which led the authors to recommend adapting, or removing this component from subsequent applications of the index. In our study, the mean score for this component was 9.97 (SD 0.52) out of a maximum of 10, which supports this proposition. The Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) was the only Diet quality scores (DQS) with a positive association with calcium intake, contrary to a previous evaluation in the Dutch EFCOVAL study [15]. The EFCOVAL study also reported a lack of association between the Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) and serum total carotenoids and TC, although the sample size (n = 121 adults aged 45–65 years) was smaller than in our study [15].",db10ff4f-0489-427a-9cc8-5d18bc47f5ab
27,methods27," The Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) is yet to be evaluated against disease outcomes.  MedDietScore (MDS) in the Food4Me cohort were greater than reported in the ATTICA cohort (n = 3042): 25.46 (±2.94) for men (Food4Me, 32.3; Greek participants, 33.6) and 27.18 (±3.21) for women (Food4Me, 32.5; Greek participants 34.4). This difference in scores may be explained by the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the ATTICA cohort [42]. Adherence to the MedDietScore (MDS) in the ATTICA cohort was associated with reduced prevalence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and obesity. In addition, a 10-unit increase in the diet score was associated with a 4% lower 10-year CHD risk (±0.1%, p < 0.001) [12]. As per the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), the Mediterranean-type scores, also containing ‘fruit’ and ‘vegetable’ components, were positively associated with total carotenoids (5th quintile: MedDietScore (MDS), 1.",6b237040-995f-42c9-99b9-b6cb5778718d

Implications In our present study, all of the Diet quality scores (DQS)s were positively associated with the omega-3 index (dried blood spot (DBS)), which is a reliable biomarker of n-3 status, and dietary oily fish and n-3 PUFA, EPA, and DHA intake [43,44]. This is partly expected given that the AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) directly assess long-chain omega-3 fatty acid intake (g/day) and EPA/DHA (mg/day), respectively, and the MedDietScore (MDS) and P-MedDietScore (MDS) assess ‘fish’ and ‘fish or shellfish’, respectively. The Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) includes components for ‘seafood and plant protein’ and ‘ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids’. Mean dried blood spot (DBS) omega-3 indices in the 5th quartile of the Diet quality scores (DQS)s ranged from 5.8% for MedDietScore (MDS) to 6.",61f504b7-f21d-40db-be58-b5989812f98c
29,methods29,"4% for the P-MedDietScore (MDS); an index of 8% has been associated with the most cardio-protective effect and 4% with the greatest risk of CHD mortality [27]. The omega-3 index has been proposed as a risk factor for CHD [45]. Recently, high correlation (r = 0.97) has been reported between dried blood spot (DBS), EPA, and DHA, and the omega-3 index, confirming the utility of dried blood spot (DBS) for the assessment of omega-3 index [46].  Diet quality scores (DQS) were also positively associated with total PA (physical activity levels (PAL)) (except MedDietScore (MDS)) and minutes of moderate (MPA) and vigorous (VPA), and were negatively associated with minutes of SB.",44a470e8-0456-4bb3-bad9-88d9054b0fc2
30,methods30," For the AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and P-MedDietScore (MDS), greater diet quality (Q5) was associated with 12 min more moderate (MPA)+vigorous (VPA) and 15 min less SB, when compared with Q1; for the Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI), these differences were 33 and 37 min, respectively, indicating a more discriminant measure of PA. This is somewhat expected given that the Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) is the only Diet quality scores (DQS) to include PA as a scoring component [14]. Positive associations between diet quality and total PA have been reported previously for the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) [34]. Furthermore, low PA (e.g., increased sedentary time) has been widely associated with negative health behaviours, such as lower fruit and vegetable consumption in adolescents (n = 11,631) [47].  In spite of lack of associations between Diet quality scores (DQS) and some markers of cardiovascular risk (e.g.",88bb261b-d272-4984-a4cb-c2d82a925b7b
31,methods31,", TC and blood pressure), the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) have been associated with significant risk reductions (RR) for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cancer, and type-II diabetes [9]. Although no association between dried blood spot (DBS) TC and ‘diet quality’ was observed in the Food4Me Study, markers of dietary intake (e.g., total carotenoids and omega-3-index) were strongly associated with higher Diet quality scores (DQS). The observed heterogeneity of Diet quality scores (DQS) across countries within the Food4Me Study suggest that certain diet scores may be more suited to particular geographical regions than others: depending on the typical dietary pattern of the population (e.g., Mediterranean or Western).  4.4.",9db48a51-e338-42f8-8356-4cce4b2388e8
32,methods32," Strengths and Limitations A limitation of our present study is the lack of further risk outcome measures (including LDL and HDL-C), which would enable more in-depth comparison and evaluation of the Diet quality scores (DQS). The use of dried blood spot (DBS)-derived markers for the assessment of TC differs from approaches that were used in previous studies; however, TC measured in dried blood spot (DBS) and serum display moderate to strong correlation (r = 0.66–0.78) [48,49]. Whilst anthropometric data were self-reported, which may have introduced error, the accuracy of Internet-based self-reported weight and height was confirmed in our previous research with strong correlations observed between self-reported and measured height (0.990 (95% CI 0.987–0.993), p < 0.0001) and weight (0.994 (0.991–0.995), p < 0.0001) [50].",24b5993a-fbea-49d0-a2f7-6f4f521b4131
33,methods33," In addition, sufficiently accurate self-reported WC measurements were reported in the EPIC-Oxford cohort (n = 4492), whereby no instructions were provided to participants [51]; in Food4Me, detailed written and digital instructions were given. Participants were recruited onto the study across the seasons (2012–2014), limiting the impact of confounding by season, although season could have influenced adherence to the diet scores (e.g., fruit more readily available in summer). Strengths of the study include a pan-European population of adults with a wide age span, a large sample size, evaluation of several Diet quality scores (DQS)s from diverse geographical locations, and the use of a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for the assessment of dietary intake [18,19].",929d147a-c89b-49fc-beba-a2028160cc53
34,methods34," Although, for Diet quality scores (DQS) with sodium components (Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI)), intake may have been under-estimated due to the difficulty of assessing additional sodium chloride that is added to food (e.g., during cooking, at the table) using food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).  5. Conclusions In conclusion, Diet quality scores (DQS) (Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), MedDietScore (MDS), P-MedDietScore (MDS), and Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI)) were inversely associated with markers of adiposity and sedentary activity, and positively associated with markers of dietary intake (dried blood spot (DBS) total carotenoids and omega-3 index) and total PA in the Food4Me cohort.",5803ad02-b9d3-4284-bf9d-042d9575065a
35,methods35," Across the EU, Spain scored significantly higher using Mediterranean-type Diet quality scores (DQS) (MedDietScore (MDS) and P-MedDietScore (MDS)) and Northern-EU countries tended to score higher with Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI) and AHealthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI); development of an effective pan-EU Diet quality scores (DQS) may be useful for directly comparing healthy eating patterns across Europe. Associations between Diet quality scores (DQS) and dietary components/nutrients that were not assessed in the indices (e.g., dairy and calcium intake) may be used to determine the score most suited to a population group. Further validation of these scores against cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk markers in pan-EU populations might reveal valuable information. ",98ecf705-e3fb-42e6-bbbc-0dafbf4dd2aa
