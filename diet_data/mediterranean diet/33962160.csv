0,methods0," 2.1. Subjects and Lifestyle Interventions  Details of the study design have been published elsewhere [30,31]. Briefly, the NUTRIATT study was a randomized clinical trial (randomized clinical trial (RCT)) (https:www.clinicaltrials.gov (accessed on 15 October 2021, NCT02347696) based on lifestyle interventions, conducted in South Italy from March 2015 to January 2020. In this study, subjects with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in both hospital and general practitioners’ settings were enrolled. The inclusion criteria for this study were: (1) body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) ≥ 25 kg /m2; (2) age >30 years old <60; and (3) moderate or severe Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",19587cd9-7625-4d21-8621-5e5bff64bdb0
1,methods1," The exclusion criteria included: (1) overt cardiovascular disease and revascularization procedures; (2) stroke; (3) clinical peripheral artery disease; (4) current treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs; (5) fasting glucose >126 mg/dL, or casual glucose > 200 mg/dL; (6) more than 20 g/day of alcohol intake; (7) medical conditions that could affect participation in a nutritional intervention study; and (8) people following a special diet, involved in a weight loss program, who had experienced recent weight loss, or were unable to follow a diet for religious or other reasons. Details about lifestyle interventions, enrolment and sample size estimation have been previously described [24].",ce796bc1-f8f6-4b98-ab35-a0780c6e974d
2,methods2," In total, 166 subjects were randomized to 6 study categories, as follows: (1) Control Diet (INRAN) based on CREA-AN [32]; (2) Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)) [33]; (3) physical activity aerobic program (ATFIS_1); (4) physical activity combined program (aerobic activity and resistance training) (ATFIS_2); (5) Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) plus ATFIS_1; and (6) Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) plus ATFIS_2. Stool samples were collected after 45 and after 90 days of treatment.  2.2. The CAP Score Measurement  The controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score was used to detect and quantify hepatic steatosis. Specifically, the CAP parameter measures the degree of ultrasound attenuation due to hepatic fat at the standardized frequency of 3.5 MHz through a vibration-controlled elastography (vibration controlled elastography (VCTE)) and was quantified as dB/m.",5c82f8ed-3ff5-43ba-be7f-622f25ea5f8c
3,methods3," This procedure was implemented on FibroScan® (Echosens, Paris, France) and was recorded for each subject. Following the recommended cut-off values, Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was classified as absent (<248), mild (248–267), moderate (268–279) and severe (≥280) [34]. All the subjects provided written informed consent to participate. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee (Prot. n. 10/CE/De Bellis, 3 February 2015).  2.3. 16S rRNA Gene Amplicon Sequencing  Fresh fecal samples were collected from all subjects. Total bacterial metagenomic DNA was extracted from stool samples using the QIAamp FAST DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The final yield and quality of extracted DNA were determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and Qubit Fluorometer 1.0 (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA).",8b42f19f-ab32-4467-9adf-93682138d2d5
4,methods4," The 16S metagenomic analyses were performed at Genomix4life S.R.L. (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy). Specifically, 16S amplification was performed with the primers, Forward: 5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′ and Reverse: 5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′ [35], which target the hypervariable V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Each PCR reaction was assembled according to the Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). A negative control was included in the workflow, consisting of all the reagents used during the sample processing (16S amplification and library preparation), but not containing the sample, to avoid contamination. The resulting libraries were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA) and pooled to an equimolar amount of each index-tagged sample at a final concentration of 4 nM, including the Phix Control Library.",73ee138b-37be-47cf-b1fd-968d069013b8
5,methods5," The pooled samples were subjected to cluster generation and sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in a 2 × 300 paired-end format.  2.4. Bioinformatic Analyses  16S sequencing-derived fastQ files were checked for quality using FastQC software [36]. In silico bioinformatics analyses, including denoizing, taxa assignment and alpha and beta diversity, relied on the QIIME2 [37] microbiome platform (version 2020.8). More specifically, the QIIME plugin q2-deblur (https://github.com/qiime2/q2-deblur (accessed on 15 October 2021) was used for the 16S denoizing step and Shannon entropy and Faith’s PD were computed on the significance obtained using ad hoc available plugins. The SILVA 138 SSU database (https://www.arb-silva.de/documentation/release-138/ (accessed on 15 October 2021) was used to infer the taxonomy starting from the ASV table.",41e81592-d5d4-425f-8159-f4ac0cf638a9

Statistical Analyses  In order to assess the beta diversity occurring within our population, a first inspection of the taxa abundance distribution was conducted by means of Principal Component Analysis (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) in the R environment using the ‘FactoMineR’ package (Multivariate Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Mining) version 2.4 available in the CRAN repository (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FactoMineR/index.html (accessed on 15 October 2021)). The evidence of clustering among our samples was inspected by means of the discriminant analysis of principal components (discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC)), a multivariate analysis based on the selection of few synthetic variables (linear combinations of the original ones).",65b8092c-aaa5-400f-8a19-dbd9deb11a69
7,methods7," Specifically, in a first step, the discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) was run on the taxa abundance matrix without superimposing any metadata grouping condition and using the ‘find.clusters’ clustering algorithm. Subsequently, according to the obtained metadata information, the assigned dietary/physical activity intervention group of each sample was set as the a priori condition. The prior and posterior membership probabilities were computed and graphically translated using the ‘assignplot’ function within the adegenet R package v2.1.1 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adegenet/index.html (accessed on 15 October 2021). This allowed us to calculate the proportions of successful reassignments. To assess the weight of each variable, the taxa contributing most strongly to cluster separation were computed and plotted using the ‘assignplot’ function within the R adegenet package.  2.5.1.",267fe07f-4d7c-49c1-8eb7-e44494aefbba
8,methods8," Multivariable Fitting by the MaAslin2 R Package  The multivariable associations among 16S rRNA gene data abundances at different taxonomic levels, based on the microbial Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) sample meta-omics features, were computed using the general linear model implemented in the ‘MaAsLin 2′ R package (Microbiome Multivariable Association with Linear Models). After multiple test corrections, the significant tossed-out taxa resulting from pair-group comparisons were plotted singly as bar plots [38].  2.5.2. Inferring Metacyc Metabolic Pathways from 16S ASV Data  Per-sample metabolic pathway predictions from 16S rRNA marker gene data were obtained using Picrust2 software, which was run as a plugin within the QIIME2 library. Per-sample MetaCyc pathway abundances were used as inputs for a two-sided Welch test between the groups. A multiple test correction was conducted with Benjamini–Hochberg (q < 0.05) using STAMP software [39].  3. Results  3.1.",161e1e1b-ee43-4a7d-b1ef-ef88a3a2327c
9,methods9," The Characteristics of the Participants  A total of 166 subjects were assessed for eligibility for the present trial; 17 subjects were excluded because they did not satisfy all the inclusion criteria and 5 for various other reasons. The loss of 5 subjects occurred before the sampling follow up. A total of 30 subjects were excluded because they failed to return their feces collections. Finally, 109 subjects were evaluated in this study, randomly allocated to one of the six groups: (1) INRAN group (n = 17); (2) Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) group (n = 19); (3) ATFIS_1 group (n = 19); (4) ATFIS_2 group (n = 18); (5) Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) plus ATFIS_1 group (n = 17); and (6) Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) plus ATFIS_2 group (n = 19).

10,methods10,"  As expected, the age–sex distribution of the population under study reflected the age–sex distribution of the Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) condition in the population [34]; 53% were men. The mean age was 52.81 years (±9.29), while 12.5% of the subjects were younger than 40 years old. All subjects were overweight (body mass index (BMI) ranging between 25 and 29.9) or obese (body mass index (BMI) over 30). All the parameters considered were equally distributed among the groups at baseline, with the only exception of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) severity. In fact, more subjects had severe than moderate Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and the CAP value was over 323 dB/m in all groups. In fact, Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) severity was not used to stratify our patient cohort.  3.2.",b83a397a-251e-4054-97e1-58e5ff0d1f71
11,methods11," Sequencing Statistics and Statistical Approach  The demux filtered statistics on the whole set composed of 215 samples yielded a number of total retained reads ranging from approximately 43 K up to 321 K, whereas the number of reads that were truncated, or that exceeded the maximum ambiguous bases in the Deblur filtering, was negligible (Supplementary Materials: Tables S2–S4). Taxa assignments with relative abundances were reported for all the 6 taxonomic levels (Supplementary Materials: Tables S5–S10). The Shannon and Faith’s PD metrics were computed in QIIME2 and subjected to the Kruskal–Wallis pairwise test to find the statistically significant differences among the groups. Both metrics were concordant in depicting a non-significant variation of the alpha diversity among the compared six groups (Figure S2 and Table S11).",fe3718ec-c236-4dd2-9e6d-a0396647e2ba
12,methods12," When assessing the variables that contributed the most to stratify the samples, principal component analysis based on taxa relative abundances revealed a homogeneous distribution of the samples, without any stratification. No separation in terms of the linear distance was observed either at the family (data not shown) or the genus level (Figure S3). As a second approach, discriminant analyses of the principal components (discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC)) were run to infer possible sample stratifications. The samples at the two follow-up times (T1 and T2) were used without superimposing the group assignment. Specifically, based on the genus abundances, in order to identify the best fitting number of clusters for the Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) samples, the ‘find.cluster’ function within the adegenet R package was used. The nested k-mean algorithm finds a given number of groups maximizing the variation between the groups.",60363712-e8ca-4d50-b8e8-b9cebfef6f0f
13,methods13," The minimum elbow point reached in the Bayesian Information Criterion (Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)) curve indicated the best clustering solution corresponding to the prior six sample groups (Figure S4 panel A). The scatter discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) result was obtained by plotting the ‘find.cluster’ function output object (Figure S4 panel B). Six possible clusters were identified and the location of one of them, number six, was far from the others (Figure S4 panel B). A second discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) plot was then obtained by superimposing the samples on their group, among the six a priori assigned groups (Figure 1). The plot demonstrated that the combination of the aerobic physical activity program with the Mediterranean diet (Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1) resulted in a cluster located far from the other clusters.",6c5206f7-b778-4a17-9082-eee1bcc4a25c
14,methods14," The other clusters, including diet and physical activity non-combined interventions, were located across the second and third discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) quadrants, whereas the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_2 group deviated from this partially aggregated cluster. Except for only two discrepancies (one in the T1 and one in the T2 sample groups), the membership probability was verified for all the T1 and T2 samples.  Considering the cumulative effect of the variables on the cluster separation, well described by the discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) analysis, those taxa that were over the threshold in the loading plot graph were inspected for their relative abundances in each of the considered groups, and graphically rendered as single boxplot interquartile distributions.",a251eb5a-753a-44e9-8c57-fcd0da60f485
15,methods15," Although these taxa were the major contributors to the above-described discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) analysis, not all of them showed a clear trend in describing the separation of the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 cluster. When comparing all the groups, 19 genera did not show a clear tendency (data not shown), whereas the other 9 (Figure S5) had a different, greater distribution of Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1. Six genera had increased relative abundances in the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 samples, when compared to the other groups, i.e., Ruminococcus, Oscillospiraceae-UCG002, Oscillospiraceae-UCG005, Dialister, Alistipes, and Eubacterium eligens groups, whereas Collinsella showed a decreasing and opposite trend. Because of the lack of clear differences between the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 vs.",44167863-6ccb-4d92-bc5a-fc4d780783dd
16,methods16," both the non-combined Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) and the ATFIS_1 groups, the statistically significant differences in terms of taxa abundances were evaluated in more depth using the Maaslin2 general linear model. When the aerobic physical activity program, the Mediterranean diet, and the combination of these regimens were tested for association, nine genera were found to be statistically significant. Specifically, Ruminococcus, Lachnospiraceae_GCA900066575, Clostridia VadinBB60 group, Enterorabdus, Coprobacter, UCG002 (Oscillospiraceae), Intestinimonas, and Ruminococcaceae_g_UBA1819 were higher in Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1, whereas Coprococcus showed an opposite trend (Figure 2).",6719f16e-b022-496e-b5cf-3eeb67f60656
17,methods17,"  When the single lifestyle interventions (Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) and ATFIS_1) were merged into a single group and statistically significant associations were sought by setting the intervention group as a random effect, the genera Ruminococcus, Oscillospiraceae_g_UCG002, Intestinimonas, Ruminococcaceae_g_UBA1819, Lachnospiraceae_GCA900066575, and Clostridia VadinBB60 group were confirmed to have a statistically significant lower abundance, when compared to the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 combined group (Figure 3). Moreover, three other genera, i.e., Akkermansia, Tyzzerella, and uncultured_Peptococcaceae, were found to be higher in Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1.  The Metacyc-predicted metabolic pathways (inferred from the QIIME ASV table abundances) were inspected using a two-group Welch test, and only those that were statistically significant (q < 0.05) after multiple test corrections (BH) were considered.",88b9cfa5-4dfd-42e4-bdd3-7b916f4bd0c0
18,methods18," As reported in Figure S6, only one pathway was statistically significant, when comparing the ATFIS_1 and Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 groups. Specifically, in this last comparison, the CMP–legionaminate biosynthesis was found to be less abundant in those patients following the regimen that included anaerobic physical activity and the Mediterranean diet.  4. Discussion  The gut microbiota and its metabolites were demonstrated to play a role in the pathophysiology of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through the gut–liver axis [40]. Several studies have shown the potential role of dietary interventions in modulating the intestinal microbiota composition [41]. Moreover, physical activity has been demonstrated to impact the composition and functionality of the gut microbial population, yielding potential health benefits [42] on the gut–liver axis.",013dec53-defa-4b74-8d98-a22d42d313cb
19,methods19," Given the correlation between gut microbiota and Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in the present study, we sought to evaluate the effects of different lifestyle interventions, including two different diets (Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) and INRAN), alone or in combination with physical activity programs (aerobic activity and resistance training), on the gut microbiota plasticity. The absence of statistically significant differences in the alpha diversity detected values among the groups emphasized that balanced diets (Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) and INRAN), which can guarantee an optimal fiber and macro- and micronutrient intakes, are sufficient to determine a highly resilient gut microbiota [43].  Starchy food products abundant in the Mediterranean diet are carriers of less fermentable insoluble fibers that presented protective and important properties for immune homeostasis and the inflammatory response.",e5af7d1f-1f19-431b-a393-7e4132f17c8b
20,methods20," Specific bacterial strains are capable of metabolizing unabsorbed carbohydrates; this activity, as in the case of obese patients (as the great majority of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) subjects), is a consequence of the uptake of bioavailable SCFAs that leads to an additional availability of energy sources [44]. Fermentable dietary fibers also proved to exert anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities [45]. High-fat diets can modulate gut microbiota whose dysbiosis was highly associated with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [46].  In a previous work, we explored the differences of samples at the baseline from those after 45 and 90 days of treatment [30]. Here, the group-specific differences at the genus level were obtained by focusing on the dietary and physical activity groups after treatment.  Some interesting differences emerged from the discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) analysis.",87135ebb-321b-4421-92d3-034021113daa
21,methods21," The multivariate statistical approach that we adopted works by maximizing the variance between groups, in order to trace the major contributing differences among the groups. The absence of a physical activity program clearly determined few differences between the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) and INRAN diets, suggesting that both interventions could be considered as useful nutritional therapies in managing Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-induced dysbiosis. The same discriminant analysis succeeded in differentiating the ATFIS-1 from the ATFIS-2 intervention group, and this evidence was strengthened when the physical activity program and the Mediterranean diet were combined. When observing the discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) membership probability, the match between the a priori versus the posterior assignments confirmed that almost all samples did actually belong to the relative group (only 2 out of 109 subjects were exceptions).",59aa7ac9-55fb-4426-9e54-177b393781b6
22,methods22," The inspection for the variables most strongly influencing the group clustering obtained revealed a batch of 28 microbial genera that were then evaluated further. Many of the identified taxa had been recently assessed in another work that focused on the different regimens of physical activity in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients [47]. However, in our patient cohort, we disclosed how some of these taxa were poorly representative of the entire gut microbiota community. Furthermore, when the differences in taxa relative abundance were inspected among the group pairs, the MaAsLin2 regression model showed a non-exclusive contribution of the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 group only.  The combination of aerobic physical activity and the Mediterranean diet, measured through the CAP score in our cohort of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, had already been shown to reduce the severity of liver steatosis.",a57f175e-e691-47ae-b0b5-57bd2ee8b7dd
23,methods23," This is indicative of an improved pathologic status in the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 group of patients. It is noteworthy that the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) or ATFIS_1 regimens, considered alone, were sufficient to determine an improved trend [30]. Based on this evidence, we applied the MaAsLin2 regression model with a specific focus on the single comparison of Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 against both Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) and ATFIS_1. The statistical model identified nine statistically significant taxa, which were all enriched in Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 (labeled as ‘combined’). With the only exception of Akkermansia, which hierarchically belongs to the Verrucomicrobia phylum, all the other significant genera are Firmicutes sub-taxa.",abe08a33-b971-4832-9fd9-04e072a4750c
24,methods24," The relevance of this result is in line with published studies reporting a decrease in Firmicutes, positively associated with Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression [21,48]. This evidence is also confirmed by a recent meta-analysis [49] and other research studies [50,51], all underlining a clear lack of Ruminococcaceae in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Importantly, this family relative abundance increased in our Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 category.  In Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), Ruminococcaceae contribute to liver protection by improving the gastrointestinal barrier integrity, modulating the gut microbiome [52,53,54]. Although the Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families both contribute to the fiber digestion metabolism, the role of taxa members belonging to the latter family seems to be controversial in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients [49,55].",4049bda5-e1fa-4660-8afc-28e87436e9be
25,methods25," Moreover, increasing Lachnospiraceae have been constantly demonstrated during progression from Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [56]. In addition to the liver injury characterizing Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, another critical issue is bile acid (BA) metabolism. Several works discussed the contribution of the gut microbiota in BA singling and recycling [57]. According to this scenario, it is widely recognized that perturbations in microbiota composition, commonly referred to using the term dysbiosis, might also negatively affect the gut microbiota–host BA axis [58]. From this perspective, various research groups specifically searched for differences occurring in BA metabolism and compared dysbiotic vs. healthy microbiota [59]. Mullish et al.",eae62d63-07a5-4044-9ec0-98115521b08a
26,methods26," found a cluster of bacterial families positively linked with secondary bile acids; this cluster encompassed Bacteroidaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaeceae, and Oscillospiraceae [59]. Moreover, indole-3-propionic acid (indole 3 propionic acid (IPA)) has been associated with liver inflammation and fibrosis and its circulating levels reveal how this molecule diminished in patients with liver fibrosis, where the Mediterranean diet increases its microbial synthesis [60]. In confirming that indole 3 propionic acid (IPA) can regulate liver fibrosis in humans, other researchers argued about the higher mRNA levels of genes that are part of the metabolic pathways fundamental to hepatic stellate cell activation and fibrosis signaling [61] (doi: 10.3390/nu13103509).  Most of the taxa we found that were increased in Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 belong to the above-mentioned families.",705f8577-a246-49ce-b021-85903d672947
27,methods27," Specifically, among the nine Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 statistically significant genera, 2 were sub-taxa of Lachnospiraceae (GCA900066575 and Tyzzerella), 2 of Ruminococcaeceae (Ruminococcus and UBA1819), and 2 of Oscillospiraceae (UCG002 and Intestinimonas).  Lastly, as previously mentioned, the only genus not included in the Firmicutes phylum to exhibit an increased abundance in Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 was Akkermansia. This taxon was proposed as a candidate probiotic in the treatment of various diseases [62]. Akkermansia and Clostridum were both found to have a higher abundance in the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 group and, as evidenced in the literature, species belonging to both these genera have proven to take part in the synthesis of indole 3 propionic acid (IPA) [63].",d311e5cb-32a8-45f0-a1ed-b357e02ffd1c
28,methods28,"  Although the consumption of symbiotic bacteria, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, was used to ameliorate the Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients’ conditions [64], the role of Akkermansia (often found increased in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients) is still under discussion [49]. The contribution of Akkermansia in favoring gut well-being is largely supported in the literature, while many organisms living in the gut could exert adverse activities. Therefore, considering that, in our area of study, Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 patients followed both an optimal diet and physical activity regimen, and that Akkermansia was detected in lower abundance values in single (combining Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) plus ATFIS_1 patients) versus the combined group (Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 patients),",5e5e67f5-4d53-4790-9eb1-47d53510a505
29,methods29," we may speculate on its contribution as an additional beneficial outcome of the adoption of an Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 regimen. To understand whether the contribution of taxa may result in effective metabolic differences among the investigated groups, the complete matrix of genus abundances was used to predict the metabolic pathways. The only statistically significant result was relative to the CMP–legionaminate biosynthesis I pathway, which discriminated the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 versus the ATFIS_1 group.  Various enzymes are involved in the CMP–legionaminic acid pathway producing a bacterial analog of sialic acid [65]. In humans, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins are immune-modulating proteins that are differentially expressed on hematopoietic cells; peripheral natural killer (NK) cells are less frequent in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients [66].",501384e1-a946-4fd5-b4f9-1b6836ca9481
30,methods30," Serum levels of lectin sSiglec-7 were significantly higher in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) versus healthy patients [66]. The CMP–legionaminate biosynthesis pathway was significantly higher in the ATFIS_1 group, compared to the combined Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1 group. The lower predicted values in this pathway led us to speculate about a possible protective effect of this analog obtained by the combination of diet and physical activity. According to this hypothesis, the microbial analog would interact by causing a slowdown of the immune-regulating proteins acting synergically with NK cells, critical components of the innate immune system.  The statistical approach applied here allowed us to explore specific microbiota rearrangements, due to different tested dietary and physical activity regimens. The improved health status benefits from specific genus abundance shifts that fit the decreased CAP parameter.",20167de7-ffc7-4ea2-aa11-3b54aab52317
31,methods31,"  Although the synergistic effect resulting from the combination of diet and physical activity on our large subject cohort proved to improve the health status of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, the lack of metabolite profiles and the deep characterization of the metabolic pathways in which these metabolites are involved is the strongest limitation of the present study. An ad hoc designed metabolomics experiment would allow for a better understanding of how these mixed interventions impact Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patient metabolism.  Among the study strengths it is worth including the study design, the structured nature of both diet and physical activity programs, the measured compliance to both interventions as well as their controlled application. Moreover, the sample size was estimated to account for the effect size, power and the correlation among measures on the same subject.",061ab129-229a-4521-8e80-fe70c20b316a
32,methods32," Furthermore, a well-validated assessment of the outcome, such as FibroScan®, was implemented. The applied intention-to-treat analytical strategy prevented the design from introducing bias relating to non-adherence to the protocol of the prognosis; therefore, this randomized clinical trial (RCT) provided an unbiased assessment of treatment efficacy [67]. Moreover, it has to be considered that, in our sampling area, the most prevalent dietary pattern was the local version of the Mediterranean diet; thus, a dilution bias could be present. Another limitation may be the duration of the intervention, which prevented a wide application in the clinical field. However, the objective of the study was to estimate the effect of the intervention that was designed in order to establish its efficacy.  5.",3a80f3ed-15d1-484b-9b9b-fbce0d1a84cb
33,methods33," Conclusions  Our results highlight the contribution resulting from the synergistic effect of lifestyle interventions (diet and/or physical activity programs) on the composition of the gut microbiota in Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. In the first instance, we found that nutritional therapies based on dietary interventions contributed to reduce the dysbiosis characterizing Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, increasing the resilience of microbial communities inhabiting the gut. Furthermore, the adoption of an aerobic exercise program, in combination with the Mediterranean diet (Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD)-ATFIS_1), was able to further ameliorate specific ratios of microbes, as also evidenced by the CAP parameter used to measure steatosis levels.",ebe77ab9-f038-4db7-8e75-684410bdf681
