We evaluated serum level of Vitamin D in both group; anthropometric parameters (weight, height, body mass index—BMI—and growth percentile) and MD adherence have been explored, in order to investigate the correlation among those data and level of Vitamin D in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Lastly, the association between Vitamin D levels and severity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) symptoms has been analysed.  Results and conclusion 74% of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) group presented blood levels of Vitamin D under 30 ng/ml (normal range 30–100 ng/ml). The analysis performed showed that the two groups were significant different regards Vitamin D levels (t = 2.24, p < 0.05), according to literature. 31.9% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presented a condition of overweight and 12.",6e339e46-1ef2-4518-9159-6c18ab7e1336

Introduction Autism Spectrum Disorder (Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)) is a developmental disorder which affects communication and behavior, characterized by impairment of communication and social interaction and by repetitive, restricted and stereotyped interests [1]. There are several comorbidities associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), both psychiatric and medical. Among the latter, a condition frequently associated are eating disorders, especially regarding food selectivity which may affect up to 70–80% of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) children [2]. Food selectivity has been accurately defined by Bandini et al. [3], who reported that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) children exhibit more food refusal and limited food repertoire than tipically-developing (TD) children.",97056973-f823-461e-919c-ddbb79714b0d
3,methods3," Moreover, in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) food selectivity persists throughout childhood and the food repertoire remains narrowed [4]. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) eat a narrower range of food than TD children [5] and often they made food choices based on texture [6]. Proposed factors influencing food refusal are mainly related to the characteristics of food and they can be at least partially explained by bitter taste sensitivity [7].  Food refusal is often accompanied by important nutritional deficits that can also cause serious health problems. In detail, children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) frequently have deficiencies of vitamins, minerals and fatty acids. Using a prospective dietary data to study children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Edmond et al. observed that they eat less salad, fruits and in general less vegetables [8]. Bandini et al.",53ad2124-fb47-4a68-8dde-c687f2c31ab3
4,methods4," found that children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) had inadequate intake of nutrients comparing to TD children with same age [3]. This poor supply can lead to lower concentrations of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Folic Acid, biotin, calcium, zinc and iron in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) [9]. In addition, serum concentration of pantothenic acid, vitamin B12, Vitamin E and Vitamin D have been found to be lower in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) participants; in particular, levels of Vitamin D are significant lower compared to their peers [10]. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin existing in nature in the form of ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3); it is converted to an active form in the liver and kidney. Vitamin D metabolites circulate in the blood linked to Vitamin D Binding Protein (D Binding Protein (DBP)). Its action is mediated by the vitamin D receptor (vitamin D receptor (VDR)), a nuclear receptor expressed in over 30 different tissues.",80290aa0-3748-4a68-a088-8119b8ce2670
5,methods5," The recommended level of Vitamin D in both adults and children should be at least above 30 ng/ml [11]. The best available vitamin D sources in food are cod liver oil and fatty fish. In addition, mushrooms, fish, eggs, meat, and dairy products contain Vitamin D2 and D3 [12]. Vitamin D play a critical role in neurodevelopment, especially related to brain cell growth and differentiation and several works in literature have explored its role in the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) etiology [13].  A wide variety of foods in the diet minimises the possible deficiency of a particular nutrient.",3cde01ec-cf0c-4ff2-9b41-d4e6d44ab68a
6,methods6," The Mediterranean Diet (MD), considered as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)) in 2010, is a dietary pattern rich in plant foods, along with high to moderate intakes of fish and seafood, moderate consumption of eggs, poultry and dairy products, low consumption of red meat and a moderate intake of alcohol. MD ameliorates the intakes of micronutrients and is associated with better health effects.  The present study aims to explore serum levels of Vitamin D in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) comparing to a control group of TD subjects. Nutritional status (auxological parameters) and eating habits (MD adherence), are also evaluated in order to investigate their relationship with Vitamin D levels in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).",7829c701-9916-48a8-a132-a3c5831e9bfb
7,methods7," Lastly, we investigate the association between Vitamin D levels and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) severity symptoms.  2. Methods 2.1. Subjects Participants were a consecutive sample of children, along 12 months, referred to Department of Pediatrics—Unit of Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry, University Federico II of Naples, for an evaluation in a clinical suspicion of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). About 160 children received a full assessment, including historical informations (pregnancy, childbirth, birth weight, breastfeeding, weaning), structured clinical interviews and validated observations. Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) [14] was performed by a licensed clinician both to confirm diagnosis and to evaluate level of symptoms according to comparative score. To determine the development/intellective level, Griffiths Mental Development Scale (GMDS-ER) [15] or Leiter International Performance Test-Revised (Leiter-R) [16] were administered.",3deea8f5-73cd-46c6-bc93-e10503d6a64d
8,methods8," To establish adaptive competence of all participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), parents were interviewed by Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales—II edition (VABS-II) [17]. Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) was formulated according to DSM-5th Edition [1], and through a period of 12 months, almost 100 children received a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  The study was conducted in according to principles of Helsinki Declaration; ethical approval was obtained by the Ethics Committee of the University Federico II of Naples. Written informed consent was collected from parents or legal guardians of enrolled children for both clinical information collection and data acquisition and treatment.  Study participants included 91 children of which 47 had a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), whose parents signed informed consent form to participate to the study.

The 3 days food diary consists in a collection of information regarding the type and quantity of food, drinks, condiments and supplements taken during the day (breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks). Adherence to the MD was evaluated through KIDMED test (Mediterranean Diet Quality Index for children and adolescents) and KIDMED index was used to assess level of adherence [18]. The index ranges from 0 to 12 and is based on a 16-question test that can be self-administered or conducted by an interview.",57d96614-4038-4cc7-909d-6b4135a14048

Each patient was also investigated by blood samples, also for assessment of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration. Blood samples were collected in hospital for both Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and TD children. Phlebotomy was conducted by a pediatric nurse, collection was made in fasting status, in the morning before breakfast. All samples were regularly sent for analisis to the university central laboratory, based on gold standard reference measurement procedures and certified reference materials.",88c1a9e8-1c89-4b4f-a2c8-fa90481d9f94
15,methods15," Serum levels of Vitamin D (tested through direct immunoassay by chemiluminescence) were classified as follow: deficient when <10 ng/ml; insufficient between 10–30 ng/ml; and normal between 30–100 ng/ml.  BMI was performed to classify children in four categories as follow [19]: underweight (< 5th percentile), normal range (between 50th and 85th percentile), overweight (between 85th and 95th percentile) and obese (>95th percentile). Aged within 24 and 36 months children were evaluated performing weight and height ratio and checking it on growth curve.  2.3. Statistical analysis We applied The Statistical Package for Social Sciences software 25th edition (SPSS-25th ed.) to perform statistical analysis.

16,methods16," An independent sample T-Test analysis was performed in order to compare auxological parameters and the level of Vitamin D between the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) group and the control group. A chi-square test was used to compare categorical data (BMI categories, serum level of Vitamin D as categories). Bivariate correlational analysis (Spearman coefficient) was carried out to evaluate the relationship between severity of autistic symptoms, presence of intellectual impairment, verbal impairment and vitamin D values; adherence to the MD and vitamin D values.  3. Results The groups consisted of 91 children, 47 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 44 TD participants.

Instead, 6/44 (13.6%) of TD children presented a condition of underweight. Comparing mean BMI value and frequencies distribution of BMI categories, the analysis revealed a significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.01). 29/47 (61.7%) children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presented blood levels of Vitamin D indicative of a condition of insufficiency (insufficient level 10–30 ng/ml) and 6/47 (12.8%) presented blood levels of Vitamin D indicative of a condition of deficiency (deficient level <10 ng/ml). Just 12/47 (25.5%) subjects presented a level of vitamin D within normal range (normal range 30–100 ng/ml).",6b3951b1-c776-4a7d-8859-64e032fa0eda
18,methods18," Mean blood level of vitamin D in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) was 22.7 ng/ml, indicative of a vitamin deficiency. In control group, 24/44 (54.5%) of TD children presented blood levels of Vitamin D indicative of a condition of insufficiency and 1/44 (2.3%) levels indicative of a condition of deficiency. 19/44 (43.2%) of TD subjects presented level of vitamin D in normal range. Mean blood level of vitamin D in TD children was 27.8 ng/ml. Comparing the mean of blood Vitamin D levels, there was a significant difference among the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and the TD subjects groups (t = 2.24, p < 0.05). The analysis revealed also a significant difference between age of the two groups. Therefore, a post hoc bootstrap analysis, stratified for the variable age, was performed in order to confirm the significant difference of vitamin D in the two groups. This analysis did not alter the previous result (t = 2.24, p < 0.01).  Table 2.",9c038f60-838d-4952-8e3f-c229f6d9b639
19,methods20,"  Food habits in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were detected through KIDMED test to explore adherence to a healthy diet, such as the MD. KIDMED index was used to evaluate adherence to the MD. 12/47 (25.5%) children presented a score ≤3 (low adherence to the MD), 31/44 (66%) presented a score between 4–7 (moderate adherence to the MD) and just 4/47 (8.5%) presented score >8 (high adherence to the MD) (Table 3).  To better characterize vitamin D deficiency in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a correlation between vitamin D and KIDMED index was assessed but statistical analysis does not show a significant correlation.

Discussion Nutrition represents an important factor involved in maintaining an optimal state of health. A useful reference for setting up a correct diet in childhood is the food pyramid, which is inspired by the Mediterranean Diet [20]. The MD guarantees an intake of nutrients, optimal to maintain an adequate nutritional status.",d3be58ae-0340-427c-b847-ec85fd57eefe
22,methods23," We focused our attention on eating habits of a sample of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), evaluating adherence to the MD, nutritional status, and a possible role of the MD adherence on vitamin D serum level. In the sample, an high percentage of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients had an elevated BMI, which differed significantly from that in a TD subjects group. Moreover, adherence to the MD is low in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Our results are in line with literature. In fact, several authors have confirmed that in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) there is a higher consumption of high energy foods, greater preference for junk food, and lower consumption of healthy foods [21]. These eating habits, also linked to food selectivity, may lead to an increase in body weight up to a “state of obesity”. Therefore, poor feeding seems to be one of the possible reasons to explain the nutritional deficiencies in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).",d6ca3af0-5795-4be7-8f36-fdd8c60c2831
23,methods24,"  The greater incidence of eating problems, particularly food selectivity in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), seems to be causedby many factors. For example, sensory difficulties can lead to atypical eating behaviours, whereas children may avoid certain foods due to the consistency and/or taste and eat only a limited variety [7]. Other data underlined the presence of gastrointestinal problems [22], food allergy and intolerance [23] in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), suggesting a possible role on feeding and on food choices in this population. However, there is no conclusive answer to this serious issue.  Our results show a significant difference between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and TD subjects regarding blood level of vitamin D. The Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) group present lower concentrations of vitamin D thanTD children. This data confirms what already reported in literature. Wang T et al.",bbd75aaf-7f78-4ae8-9dd3-6d0e515b4385
24,methods25," [24] performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies that explored the correlation between vitamin D levels and children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). They reported a serum concentration of vitamin D significantly lower inchildren with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in comparison with healthy controls [10],[25]–[32].  This deficiency, together with other risk factors in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), such as reduced exercise and low exposure to the sun, restrictive diets, calcium deficiency, obesity and use of drugs, cause a low bone mineral density and a greater risk to develop metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.  In our sample, low level of vitamin D did not relate with food intake and in particular with adherence to the MD. This data may suggest that the origin of Vitamin D deficiency is not related to food style, despite the inadequate feeding in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).",2ea673c3-057b-4504-b637-7e57d16d2d1e
25,methods26," Less UVB exposition can led to low synthesis of vitamin D, however children of our sample came from the same geographical area, on the Mediterranean coast, and were regularly exposed to sunlight. It should be taken into account that less endogenous production of vitamin D in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) might depend by abnormal metabolism pathway possibly due to genetic polymorphisms [33]. Moreover other factors like digestion capacity, absorption, metabolic system, have a significant impact on nutritional status and so could influence vitamin D serum levels. In our samples, children did not present any chronic gastrointestinal disease or other conditions of malabsorption or malnutrition, as those have been considered exclusion criteria for enrollment.",ac185fcd-264b-4e78-bb5b-3458aa662622
26,methods27," However,Vitamin D deficiency in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) could be linked to insufficient intake derived yet in pregnancy [34], as reported in literature, and to a subsequent capability to replace deficiency during growth in early infant, thought food intake.  Gentile et al. [35] suggested a pathogenic model for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) highlighting the role of an immune dysregulation as primum movens of this disease. Indeed, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) may result from a complex interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors [36]. Among environmental factors, vitamin D may play a critical role because of his well-known effects on modulating immune response. In presence of these two factors (a genetic predisposition and vitamin D deficiency), a viral infection [35],[37] or a reactivation of the mothers can trigger an altered immune response that may lead to pathological neurodevelopment.",f35287db-1d37-4bbb-b124-35726af6a66c
27,methods28," Experimental evidences have been produced on this topic: gestational vitamin D deficiency has been related to an increase odd of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with Intellectual Disability (ID) offspring [38] and with a poorer motor and social development outcome [39]. Interestingly, higher neonatal Vitamin D levels were protective for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) without ID, raises interesting questions about timing and critical windows to propose vitamin D supplementation [38].  Finally, no difference was observed in relation to the severity of symptoms inAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with or without deficiency of Vitamin D. This data disagrees from other literature results [25],[26],[28], reporting a positive correlation between vitamin D levels and clinical feature.",367e2154-57f0-4a5f-a755-ea271359d2b8
28,methods29," Perhaps, the use of comparative score of ADOS-2 for the evaluation of level and gravity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) symptoms, such as the use of intellectual ability and verbal functioning, would indeed confer more effectiveness to the results that we obtained in comparison to other studies in literature which used less structured and reproducible evaluation tools.  Our results suggest that low adherence tothe MD may result in a difficulty compensating vitamin D deficiency, so that vitamin D supplementation has to be considered in addition to an balanced diet. It is very important to evaluate this nutritional parameter in regular clinical practice, not only for its posible role on neurodevelopment functions but also for the implications on the general state of health. In literature the experimental use of vitamin D is spreading, reporting an improvement the clinical features in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) [40],[41].",1408b5e6-e22c-4aea-bf12-bf64deab2388
29,methods30," In light of this is important to perform more studies on how the vitamin D may act in the etiopathogenesis and development of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and if it can become part of the complementary therapies, given the cost-benefit ratio and the therapeutic security.  Nonetheless some limitations catched our attention: a low sample size could have influenced the results observed, although they are in line with previous publications [29],[42]–[44]. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) group and controls slightly differ for age, nonetheless this difference did not interfere with the results thanks to the bootstrap analysis, afterwards done to avoid statistical bias. Moreover, the data of the eating habits through the 3-day food diary were not presented. Future studies are needed in order to analyze these aspects and carry out a more accurate assessment even for the control group.",be01f69b-4018-4f4f-8f8d-57a757a2da21
30,methods31,"  In conclusion, this study report that children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) present low adherence to the MD; this habit might imply overweight and obesity, that are observed in an higher percentage of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) compared to TD children. Low serum level of vitamin D are confirmed in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); however, this data does not correlate to adherence to the MD in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
