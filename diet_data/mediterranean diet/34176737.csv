0,results0," Weight loss was not statistically significant between the MD and LF-HC groups. disease activity score (DAS) 28 significantly decreased in MD compared to the LF-HC group (p=0.02) and controls (p=0.001). Adjusting for the baseline variables, MD reduced disease activity score (DAS) 28 by 76% (95% CI = −0.45, −0.2; p=0.03) after 12 weeks of intervention. The baseline serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) level showed 99.8% effect on disease activity score (DAS) 28 score at the end (95% CI = 0.014, 0.035; p < 0.001).  Conclusions  The MD showed beneficial effects on disease activity score (DAS) 28 compared to the LF-HC diet in patients with RA, regardless of weight loss. It is a better dietary choice for pain reduction in patients with RA.

1,results1," Introduction  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by joints involvement and systemic features with destruction of the cartilage and bone due to the involvement of autoimmune or inflammatory pathways [1]. Age, gender, genetics, and some environmental factors are the main risk factors of RA. The aims of RA treatment are reducing joint inflammation and pain in patients along with preservation of function and form of joints. The first-line of disease management are the conventional synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (cs-DMARDs) and adding a biological drug (b-DMARD) only in the case of therapeutic failure [2]. The DMARDs include methotrexate, sulfasalazine, D-penicillamine, and hydroxychloroquine [3]. All of these drugs have side effects, and patients have discomfort feelings with them.  Studies proposed that the dietary pattern, macronutrient, and micronutrient have a fundamental role in disease risk and progression [4–9].",4f264ef6-4aa5-478b-8186-868c380fde3b
2,results2," Mediterranean diet (MD) was introduced as the healthiest dietary pattern for the risk of RA occurrence and progression, as wells as its activity. The MD pattern has differences in various cultures [10–12]. Religious omits some of the essential components of MD in some countries [11]. Therefore, the MD guidelines have differences in various countries, and more studies are needed to reach the beneficial effects of this dietary pattern in patients with RA. On the other hand, bodyweight control is a primary advice in all diseases [13, 14] due to the negative impact on disease activity remission and efficacy of therapy processes. However, the effects of MD are not compared with the low-fat diet on disease severity adjusted for bodyweight reduction in patients with RA in a Muslim population with religious restrictions. Disease activity score was compared between obese and overweight patients with RA receiving MD and low-fat diet on a weight loss program.  2.",489c8668-0e70-49d2-b8eb-e32d48927787
3,results3," Materials/Subjects and Methods  2.1. Study Design and Patient Enrollment  In this randomized single-blinded feeding trial, 129 patients with RA participated. Disease was diagnosed based on the American College of Rheumatology criteria [15]. Overweight and obese patients (25 < BMI < 35 kg/m2), aged 15–75 y, without joint replacement history, and with the informed consent were included. Patients with inflammatory or chronic disorders were excluded. Patients under oral corticosteroid therapy, smokers, and heavy drinkers did not participate. Patients on a certain diet and whom reluctant to participate were excluded. The Ethical Committee of Zanjan University of Medical Sciences (IR.ZUMS.REC.1398.425) approved the present trial and registered on 09/10/2020 at Iranian clinical trials website under code number: IRCT20200929048876N2.

4,results4," Dietary Interventions  At the baseline, dietary intake was analyzed by three-day food diary (two regular days and one holiday). Then, RA patients were randomly assigned to the tree dietary groups based on the block randomization method. Diets based on 28 kcal/kg/day were determined. In MD, 35% of total calorie was provided from fasts; however, this portion was 20% in the low-fat group. Protein percentage was equal in the both dietary groups (15%). The remaining percentages were allocated to carbohydrates. Patients on MD were allowed to consume 150 g of red meat per month. Olive and canola oils were recommended as the main source of dietary fat. Participants were encouraged to consume one serving of legume and nut each day, as well as consume low-fat dairies. Mercury-free fish oil supplements were consumed two times per week. The control group followed their regular diet for 12 weeks.  2.3.",99a064f5-fc8f-4ea4-a32f-c12ea188041e
5,results5," Outcomes  The disease activity score 28 (disease activity score (DAS) 28) questionnaire was completed for each patient. This questionnaire consists of twenty-eight tender (Ritchie Articular Index; RAI) and swollen joint count (swollen joint count (SJC)) scores including the same joints: shoulders, elbows, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, and the knees. Moreover, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and the patients' general health (GH) or global disease activity measured on a visual analogue scale (visual analogue scale (VAS)) were considered in the disease activity score (DAS)28 calculation formula [17].(1) disease activity score (DAS) 28=0.53938×sqrtRAI+0.06465×44swollen joint count (SJC)+0.330×lnerythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)+0.00722×GH.

Because of variations in the RA incidence around the world, recently, risk factors other than the genetics and races have been considered [17, 18]. It is hypothesized that other effective factors such as diet and lifestyle are the determinants of RA occurrence and severity [19]. One of the proposed dietary patterns for RA patients is MD.",a5afd225-7987-4b70-8ae8-7b9b3d70b3d4
12,results12," This dietary pattern combines a set of skills, knowledge, practices, and traditions ranging from the panorama to the practice. This dietary pattern involves crops, harvesting, fishing, conservation, processing, preparation, and consumption of food [20]. Daily consumption of olive oil, unrefined cereals, and fresh or dried fruit and vegetables are the main characteristics of MD. Fish, dairy, and meat are recommended in moderate amounts. Condiments and spices, wine, or its infusions are consumed, frequently [20]. Therefore, MD is rich in nutrients and bioactives with anti-inflammatory effects [21]. Because of variations in food industries, religious, and attitudes in different countries, there is a need to restudy this hypothesis in different countries. On the other hand, obesity is a risk factor for inflammation in the body. There is no study to assess whether weight loss has an important role in pain relief or other factors and bioactives in MD lead to pain reduction.",26a033ff-9f0e-4fcd-86f3-a8fa07ea1986
13,results13," In the intervention studies, there is mixed results for pain. The longer duration studies (≥12 weeks) reported the beneficial effects of MD on pain relief in RA patients. However, inconclusive results were reported on disease activity score (DAS) 28 [22, 23]. Because of the progressive and degenerative nature of RA, pain scores would increase with time. The present study was limited in the method of dietary adherence which was assessed based on self-declaration of patients. The disease activity score (DAS) 28 questionnaire was filled by patients, that is, dependent to their opinion. According to the literature review, no study compared the effects of the MD pattern with the low-fat diet in a weight loss program up to now. Herein, we concluded that MD has a beneficial effect on disease activity score (DAS) 28 compared to the low-fat diet in patients with RA, regardless of weight loss.  5.",0fad4706-cf13-4b71-9265-232da8cebce4
