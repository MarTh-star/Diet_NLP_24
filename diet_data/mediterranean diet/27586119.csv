Furthermore, dietary approaches to stop hypertension trial (DASH) diet is now recommended as an ideal eating dietary pattern for all adults.(9,10) High fiber, antioxidant components, unsaturated fatty acids, and low-fat dairy in dietary approaches to stop hypertension trial (DASH) diet can also improve insulin homeostasis and glucose tolerance.",a9cc0a3c-86f7-4990-b986-6b925ec16d9f

Trained interviewers team collected information using local validated questionnaires. Smoking status was obtained during face-to-face interviews. Physical activity levels measured according to the frequency and time spent on light, moderate, high and very high intensity activities, according to the list of common activities of daily life over the past year.

Calculation of diet quality scores We constructed the dietary approaches to stop hypertension trial (DASH) score based on 8 components: high intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy products, and whole grains and low intake of sodium, sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats.

Sum of 8 component scores indicated total dietary approaches to stop hypertension trial (DASH) score that ranged from 8 to 40. The healthy eating index (HEI) is structured based on 12 dietary components and divided in tow main categories; adequacy and moderation. The Adequacy contains 9 components as: total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, greens and beans, whole grains, dairy, total protein foods, seafood and plant proteins and fatty acid [(PUFAs + MUFAs)/SFAs].

The maximum possible score on the index is 100 (optimal diet) and gives equal weight to all 10 components (0–10 each) while taking minimal account of age and sex differences. Point values are calculated proportionally for consumed quantities which fall between the maximum and minimum levels of consumption.(25) Adherence to the Mediterranean eating plan was assessed with an index variable that was composed of the 9 Mediterranean food groups.(26) For each food group, a value of 0 or 1 was assigned with the use of the sex-specific median as the cutoff.

Studies have shown that higher intakes of whole grains, as important components of dietary approaches to stop hypertension trial (DASH) diet, could increase insulin sensitivity; fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates of whole grains, promote production of short-chain fatty acids and may lead to enhanced glucose oxidation and insulin clearance.(12,34) Soluble fiber and indigestible carbohydrates could also decrease intestinal transit time, delay gastric emptying and intestinal absorption and may consequently decrease glucose and insulin responses.",d67d013c-e404-4c2e-a9ae-8b701dfd3372

Lack of data on postprandial levels of insulin to calculate the disposition index and accurately justify insulin homeostasis parameters, was a limitation for explanation of the observed associations.
