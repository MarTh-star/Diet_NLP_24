1,methods1," At 8 weeks of age, obese and lean rats were randomly assigned to the following groups (n=5): lean rats fed chow diet (LC), obese rats fed control chow diet (OC), lean rats fed chow diet supplemented in 2% (w/w) of sofrito (LS), and obese rats fed chow diet supplemented in 2% (w/w) of sofrito. Control chow diet (Teklad Global 2018) was provided by Harlan Laboratories (Milan, Italy) and sofrito that was used to supplement the chow diet was furnished by Gallina Blanca-Star (Barcelona, Spain). Animals were fed ad libitum. The supplementation was calculated according to the consumption of tomato by the human population, in which 2.25 g/kg of sofrito per week was administered [22].  Food intake and body weight were evaluated weekly. After 8 weeks of the diet intervention, animals were sacrificed by decapitation.

3,methods3," Untargeted Approach  The untargeted analysis (metabolomics and lipidomics) was performed using an Orbitrap LTQ-XL (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany), interfaced to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 system, consisting of an autosampler and quaternary gradient HPLC-pump. Mass measurements were acquired in centroid mode and in both positive and negative ionization modes. The samples were injected twice. The first injection was dedicated to the acquisition of full scan spectra at a resolution of 30,000 at m/z 400 while the second injection was dedicated to the acquisition of high-resolution MS/MS data under data-dependent acquisition (data dependent acquisition (DDA)) mode. In data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode, the resolving power for both the MS and MS2 scan was 7500 at a collision energy of CID 35eV using an isolation window of 2Da.

In the LTQ component of the instrument, nitrogen was used as both the sheath gas (70 U) and auxiliary gas (30 U), and helium was used as the damping gas. All measurements were carried out using the automatic gain control of LTQ to adjust the number of ions entering the trap.  To ensure data quality, a quality control (QC) with an equitable mixture of all different extracts was prepared and a mix of deuterated internal standards were used to fortify the samples, with IS-1 for metabolomics and IS-2 for lipidomics (Supplementary Materials S1). Quality controls were injected before, during, and once the sequence was finished to control the retention time shifts and mass accuracy. The QC injections were also used to verify the analytical variability and injection order effect.",3cb219ee-171c-44c5-8f69-8a230e27ed39
5,methods5,"  Metabolite identifications were performed by the detected pseudo-molecular ion with a mass accuracy of 5 ppm and the isotopic pattern was checked with the theoretical isotope profile. Identification was confirmed by MS/MS experiments and comparison of the spectra with different spectral databases such as mzCloud and the literature. Isotopes and adducts were annotated for corroborate identification. Metabolites were classified according to metabolomics guidelines using four levels of identification [27]. For the lipidomics approach, the identification was further corroborated by Kendricks Mass Defect (Kendricks Mass Defect (KMD)) calculated by the hydrogen base and graphs were plotted to eliminate possible misidentification (Figure 1 and Figure 2) [28].

10,methods10,"  The processed data was first filtered by excluding features that were also present in the solvent samples by selecting those features for which the mean value within the study samples was at least twice the corresponding mean value within the solvent samples. A second filter associated with sample representativeness was applied using the 75% rule, which consisted of retaining those features that were consistently found in at least 75% of the samples of at least one experimental group. A third filter was applied using the coefficient of variation (CV), excluding those features for which their CV was higher in the QC samples than in the study samples. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by applying feature-wise multiple linear regression using the “limma” R package [37] and the p-values were adjusted by the Benjamini–Hochberg method to control for the false discovery rate.  2.5.",79d53a7c-e941-44c0-a5b5-590ffd292554
11,methods11," RNA Isolation and Quantitative RT-PCR  Total RNA was extracted from liver or adipose tissues using Trizol Reagent. Retrotranscription and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) were performed as previously described [38]. Relative mRNA levels were measured using the CFX96 Real-Time System, C1000 Thermal Cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The primer sequences used are shown in Table S1. Relative gene expression was estimated using the comparative Ct (2−ΔΔct) method in relation to β-actin and S18 levels. The gene expression assays are expressed as the mRNA relative levels and referred to 1 assigned to lean or obese control rats, as indicated. Significant differences were assessed by a two-way ANOVA.  3. Results and Discussion  The untargeted analysis did not show any signals with statistically significant differences between the studied groups for plasma (data not shown).",ca91b205-2444-46fb-99c9-f7ebb507e0b2
12,methods12," In contrast, the liver samples revealed a difference in relation to the sofrito consumption, but there was no difference in relation to the health status (obese and eutrophic). Most of the discriminant features corresponded to the metabolite C001 (Table 1). The C001 metabolite shown in the negative and positive mode indicated several significant signals between pseudo-molecular ion, isotopes, and adducts, with the main marker being explored. The most intense ion detected in negative mode was m/z 265.0928, corresponding to the deprotonated ion [M-H]-, and showing fragments at m/z 247.0825 and m/z 229.0719 associated with two consecutive losses of water moieties in the MS/MS spectra (Figure 3A, Table 1). The presence of a fragment at m/z 175.0250, along with fragments at m/z 113.0248, m/z 99.0091, m/z 95.0142, m/z 87.0091, and m/z 85.0299 revealed a glucuronic moiety in the molecule (Figure 3A, Table 1). Therefore, the neutral loss of 90.",c7c3a964-358d-4a19-861d-911a37ae718a
13,methods13,"0680 indicates the conjugate free metabolite, with a possible molecular formula of C4H10O2 (Figure 1). In FS of positive ionization mode, the ion with the highest intensity corresponded to the ammonia adduct, which was found at m/z 284.1341. Similarly, the fragmentation spectra showed two consecutive water moiety losses. The fragment at m/z 91.0752 indicates the aglycone-free metabolite, with its fragment m/z 73.0646. This metabolite was tentatively identified as butanediol glucuronide. The plot of the peak intensities of butanediol glucuronide confirms its presence only in the animals that were supplemented with sofrito (LS and OS) (Figure 3B). As shown in the figure, there is an increasing trend in the LS group in comparison to the OS group, but a statistical level of significance was not reached. This compound was not detected in sofrito (data not shown) or its ingredients [39,40,41].",6b9a3212-49d2-4eeb-9bf8-bcbb02109e58
14,methods14," Considering this, we may speculate that butanediol glucuronide is a result of co-metabolism of the host and gut microbiome. As reviewed by Ji et al. [42], butanediol can be produced by a variety of microbiota species in the gut such as Enterobacter species through the anaerobic fermentation of glucose. After uptake from the intestine, it may enter the circulation and subsequently can undergo conjugation to the glucuronide moiety in the liver. Hossain et al. [43] reported a high content of butanediol as a result of pumpkin extract fermentation by Bacillus subtilis HA and Lactobacillus plantarum EJ2014. In the same study, the authors demonstrated that the administration of this butanediol-rich fermented pumpkin extract to animals fed a high-fat diet promoted a lower accumulation of fat in different depots, decreased free fatty acids, and improved the lipid profile in plasma [43].",ae7593a4-475f-4a42-bd31-d730f51c731b
15,methods15," The pumpkin extract also led to modulation of the expression of PPARγ, a key gene in the control of energy expenditure in white adipose tissue, indicating a possible bioactivity of butanediol.  Obesity development is characterized by adipose tissue hypertrophy and the accumulation of ectopic fat, which interferes with cellular and organ functions [44]. Adipose tissue hypertrophy is associated with increased inflammation, high rates of lipolysis, and insulin resistance. When reaching its maximum capacity of lipid accumulation, adipose tissue redirects lipids to other organs, especially to the liver, leading to dyslipidemia and hepatic problems [5]. A potential strategy to attenuate free fatty acids released by adipocytes is to reduce the lipolysis or to increase the ability to oxidize fatty acids by the β-oxidation process, increasing the mitochondrial content and adipose tissue browning; that is, the induction of thermogenically active adipocytes in white fat depots [5].",1e9a3673-5f0c-4d0a-b751-bf7818820759
16,methods16," To explore these mechanisms, the metabolomics and lipidomics assays performed in both liver and adipose tissue were further confirmed by gene expression in both tissues.  First, to understand the role of butanediol found in sofrito-fed rats in metabolism, gene expression analysis focused on liver energy metabolism was performed. The results indicated an increase in the expression of the esterification enzymes mediating the synthesis of TG from DG, DGAT1 and DGAT2, in lean and obese animals that were supplemented with sofrito in relation to their controls (Figure 4), being particularly upregulated in the OS group (Figure 4).",7c81032c-06e7-4c6b-abef-19f9528cf4f6
17,methods17," This increment may suggest a decrease in circulating free fatty acids for triglyceride synthesis in the liver, a result that is associated with a significant increase in CPT1A and PRDM16 expression in the groups supplemented with sofrito, especially in obese rats, indicating a higher rate of fatty acid oxidation and higher mitochondrial function, respectively (Figure 4). In line with these results, a sofrito-based diet could contribute to the removal of circulating free fatty acids and their use as a source of energy. DGAT1, which is upregulated in OS, has been also described to play an important role in recycling fatty acids hydrolyzed from triglycerides in cells, protecting them from accumulation, supporting the beneficial role of sofrito on fatty acids metabolism and fat distribution [45].",c0a74ab9-160d-4fda-981b-7546bf8cd2c4
18,methods18,"  Clinical interest has emerged in the use of therapeutic strategies able to increase liver fat oxidation, including ketogenic diets, intermittent fasting, and pharmacotherapies to treat obesity, insulin resistance, and non-alcoholic fat liver disease [46]. It has recently been reported that a decreased mitochondrial fuel supply in the liver may optimize the balance between energy supply and demand in a way that may not decrease steatosis but may decrease tissue damage and insulin resistance [46,47]. Ketogenic diets, in which carbohydrates are absent and calories restricted, generate ketone bodies, the primary source of energy for the oxidation of free fatty acids [46,48]. Recently, ketone bodies have been suggested as a fuel for mitochondria and a prominent activator of mitochondrial bioenergetics in adipose tissue that could be a tool in obesity control [49].",4d51eb1d-3718-4dcc-8e7f-cdd7c17127f6
19,methods19," Butanediol has been described as a precursor molecule of β-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body, which plays significant roles in energy homeostasis, being used as an oxidative fuel, lipogenic precursor, and signaling molecule. β-hydroxybutyrate is predominantly synthesized in the liver, being the most abundant ketone body in the circulation, and transported to other tissues for conversion into energy [46,48]. In an established obesity state, insulin resistance can lead to a lack of energy in peripheral tissues and the production of ketone bodies could be a compensatory mechanism. In our study, the ITT test performed on the experimental animals revealed a better response of the OS group animals in relation to the OC group, indicating an improvement in insulin resistance (Table S2).",cba11791-9a94-4755-927f-9d2423c337c4
20,methods20," The increase in liver G6Pase expression in the LS group may indicate an activation of gluconeogenesis by sofrito, whereas this increase was not significant in the OS group in relation to OC, probably due to insulin resistance (Figure 4), and no changes were observed in PEPCK expression, another indicator of the gluconeogenic rate in the liver. On the other hand, there was a significant increase in the expression of HMGCoA and PKL in the liver of the OS group compared to the OC and lean groups, which indicates activation in the ketogenic pathway (Figure 4). These findings suggest that butanediol could be acting as a substrate by metabolism to produce hydroxybutyrate in a ketogenic process and its excess is eliminated in the form of glucuronide or is a final product of energy metabolism due to the activation of different pathways by sofrito.  Activation of the ketogenic process could also act as a crosstalk between liver and adipose tissue.",bf6c1679-245e-41b1-b000-0041eb9498bc
21,methods21," Then, we performed lipidomic analysis in both epididymal and visceral white adipose tissues. These results indicated statistically significant differences for 15 diglycerides (DGs) and 106 triglycerides (TGs) between both fat depots, which were annotated at the level of confidence 3, relying on the precursor ion mass accuracy, fragmentation pattern (Table 1), and relationship between the retention time and Kendricks Mass Defect (KMD)(H) (Figure 1 and Figure 2). On the one hand, epididymal white adipose tissue displayed changes in its composition depending on the type of diet (control vs. sofrito) (Table 1, Figure 5). In general, the sofrito-fed rats had diglycerides as markers in the tissue composition, indicated by 12 molecules that represented 80% of the total DGs in the lipidomics, while the control diet-fed rats had triglycerides as the majority in the tissue composition, consisting of 52 different molecules that represented 52% of the identified TGs (Table 1).",e130ca06-72d8-4558-9252-362c5ffb4ed7
22,methods22," In epididymal adipose tissue, gene expression analysis revealed a significant decrease in the LPL and HSL mRNA levels in obese animals, which was more pronounced in the OS group (Figure 6), indicating an attenuation of the lipolysis process in OS. These two genes are related to the process of fatty acid production in a non-selective way, indicating a reduction in the lipolysis of TGs and DGs to increase storage. The lower lipolytic action is also associated with the action of ketone bodies in sofrito-fed rats since β-hydroxybutyrate has been described as an inhibitor of lipolysis in adipocytes by activating GRP109R, which helps to reduce circulating fatty acids [46,50]. Furthermore, the lower trend of mRNA expression levels of CGI, a co-factor ATGL, in epididymal adipose tissue found in obese animals compared to lean, although without statistical significance, could contribute to non-activation of the TGs hydrolysis process (Figure 6).",b76df032-1488-4d3f-909c-819069baf911
23,methods23," The presence of a higher DG content in animals supplemented with sofrito by lipidomics could suggest a lower uptake of fatty acids and storage by the tissue, since both obese groups have the same expression of DGAT1 and DGAT2 but with different lipid profiles (Figure 1). This result could indicate that the modulation of the composition of epididymal white adipose tissue is not a direct consequence of the lipolysis process by the inhibition of ketone bodies and could involve other metabolic pathways in the tissue. Therefore, there is no activation of the lipolysis process nor of the synthesis or hydrolysis of TGs, suggesting a higher content of DGs in the animals supplemented with sofrito. In this way, the free fatty acids that reach the adipose tissue are not being used for storage but could be used by another pathway. Thus, the modulation of the lipid profile could involve the bioactive compounds present in the sofrito.",4ff14a63-70c9-4347-b32b-fddb4c08c2e6
24,methods24," Lipidomics also reported that control animals showed a higher TG content versus sofrito, with some TGs being more abundant in the OC group compared to the LC group such as TG(18:2_18:3_18:3) and TG(17:1_18:2_18:3) (Figure 5).  When analyzing the expression pattern of genes related to mitochondrial activity, the browning process, and adipocyte function (PGC1α, CIDEA, PRDM16, UCP1, leptin, and PPARγ), no significant differences were appreciated when comparing lean vs. obese and control vs. sofrito, despite the tendency for upregulation of these genes in the OS group compared to OC for PGC1α and PPARγ (Figure 6). These genes may indicate activation of the adipocyte energy metabolism in OS animals, stimulating glucose metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and the insulin response. However, without UCP1 regulation, we can rule out the hypothesis that fatty acids can be used to generate heat by mitochondria under the sofrito-fed condition in epididymal white adipose tissue.",bc38a4ce-739a-4131-8d23-e7cfab10a031
25,methods25," The lack of browning induction in this fat depot agrees with previous investigations exploring the metabolic response of the different adipose tissues of obese mice at different temperatures, showing a lower level of thermogenic activation in epididymal depots compared to retroperitoneal depots in response to low temperatures [51,52].  On the other hand, visceral white adipose tissue showed differences in its composition in relation to the health status of the animals, regardless of the type of diet. In this fat deposit, obese animals showed DGs as markers of the tissue composition, represented by 9 DGs that make up 60% of the total identified DGs. Regarding the composition of triglycerides, a total of 20 different triglycerides were detected as markers of obese versus lean while lean groups had a higher content of 81 different TGs compared to obese groups (Table 1).",83508d33-c3e5-4116-9f15-c99521d3bd8f
26,methods26," It is noteworthy that the TG markers for the obese groups showed fatty acids with a small carbon chain compared to lean, with a predominance of palmitic acid (16:0) and unsaturation (16:1) (Table 1). Visceral adipose tissue is considered the main storage destination during the obesity process. The presence of higher levels of DGs (Figure 7) in obese animals may be indicative of tissue saturation in which the triglyceride production process is limited, and fatty acids can be sent to other tissues. Grzybek et al. [53] confirmed that animals fed a high-fat diet showed a higher content of diglycerides in visceral fat depots when obesity was induced compared to eutrophic animals by lipidomics analysis.  Gene expression analysis in this tissue revealed that there was no difference in the expression of the lipolysis proteins LPL and HSL between the groups, even with a trend of downregulation for OS compared to the others (Figure 8).",e52888d2-3085-4a19-91e3-853edcedb56b
27,methods27," When comparing the mRNA levels of the lipases, CGI revealed a significant reduction in the expression for OS rats when compared to the LS group but without significant differences in the other groups (Figure 8). This result could indicate a possible action of sofrito supplementation on fatty acid metabolism in fat deposits, with it being necessary to explore new pathways of action. Previous results published by Sandoval et al. [23] demonstrated a beneficial effect of sofrito supplementation on the resistance to FGF21 caused by obesity in visceral adipose tissue. FGF21 is an important hormone in the regulation of energy metabolism and has been pharmacologically explored for the treatment of obesity, diabetes type II, and metabolic syndrome, especially by activating the browning process [54].",ca6b15f6-3f86-4af6-bd5a-533b1d8788db
28,methods28," In our study, we did not find significant changes in either the sofrito or obesity condition in the expression pattern of genes related to browning activity in visceral white adipose tissue (Figure 8). Therefore, it is not possible to associate the lipid profile of visceral adipose tissue with the induction of the browning process. Walton et al. [49] investigated the role of ketone bodies in altering the mitochondrial bioenergetics in different fat depots, showing that treatment with β-hydroxybutyrate increased the expression of genes related to thermogenesis, such as PRDM16, PGC1a, and UCP1, in adipocytes. However, the subcutaneous deposit responds better to the stimulus compared to the visceral depots, with a possible explanation being the variation in the expression of the G protein-coupled receptor.",6e7de042-6bb5-4f04-9a22-b0cdb5e56636
29,methods29,"  To sum up, chronic consumption of tomato sofrito revealed that even with a higher caloric intake, there was no difference in the weight gain and weight of the fat deposits of the animals. This information led us to investigate the impact of this food component on energy metabolism through an untargeted metabolomics approach in the plasma and liver, revealing the metabolite butanediol glucuronide as the main biomarker after sofrito intake. The use of gene expression analysis indicated a modulation in the hepatic tissue, with an increase in the uptake and oxidation of lipids for energy production and the activation of the ketone bodies pathway as a possible alternative fuel for non-hepatic tissues in sofrito-fed animals. The lipidomics analysis revealed a difference in the epididymal white adipose tissue by the consumption of sofrito, verifying a decrease in the lipolysis process that could be attributed to ketone bodies but without activation of oxidative processes.",9764826d-b05c-42a0-8936-524feaaecad1
30,methods30," On the other hand, visceral adipose tissue showed a difference between obese and eutrophic individuals, but even with tendencies to oxidative processes in animals supplemented with sofrito, this did not reflect a different tissue lipid profile. Sofrito intake could be used as an activator in the hepatic ketogenic process for energy homeostasis and in the control of body weight gain. The crosstalk between tissues should be further investigated to better understand the role of butanediol in weight gain regulation and fat deposit accumulation in obesity.  4. Conclusions  This untargeted approach revealed the presence of butanediol glucuronide as a marker for tomato sofrito intake in lean and obese supplemented animals. This molecule was related with activation of the ketogenic process in liver, which was confirmed by targeted gene expression by overexpression of HMGCoA and PKL in the sofrito-supplemented groups.",d4c159b9-5bda-4957-bde7-2decff1847ae
31,methods31," The increase in the expression of CPT1A and PRDM16 in the liver of obese animals supplemented with sofrito also indicated fatty acids metabolism activation. The lipidomics approach was able to identify differences in the composition of epididymal adipose tissue by diet with an inhibition of the lipolysis process that could be related to the activation of ketogenesis by crosstalk between the liver and fat depots.  The use of untargeted omics approaches showed the possibility that a new biomarker identified after the consumption of sofrito could be contributing to its beneficial effects on obesity. The role of bioactive food compounds in the activation of energy metabolism and the browning process is already described in the literature; however, new compounds originating from microbiota and metabolism must also be elucidated.",3aa0f8f4-40a7-4663-b578-44b43f07dd9a
32,methods32," The presence of butanediol glucuronide, a precursor of ketone bodies, has been shown to activate ketogenesis in the liver and act as a mediator of crosstalk with adipose tissue, helping to understand the role of sofrito in the regulation of energy metabolism in obese Zucker rats. Our study indicates the potential contribution of butanediol glucuronide to monitor the response to nutritional interventions such as those with tomato-based sofrito, and it also suggests ketogenesis and its metabolites as a target pathway to manage obesity and related diseases. These findings provide further insight into the beneficial effect of crucial components of the Mediterranean diet in the management of metabolic diseases such as obesity.
