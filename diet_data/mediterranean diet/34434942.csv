Previous studies have investigated individual food groups in relation to metabolic health status of adolescents, mainly in Western countries. Limited data are available on the association between dietary patterns and metabolic health in Middle East nations, where childhood overweight/obesity is increasing drastically.

Further prospective cohort studies are needed to confirm these findings.  Isfahan University of Medical Sciences2400244 ==== Body pmc1. Introduction  In the current century, a great concern has been raised regarding the growing prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents [1, 2]. Obesity is an important risk factor for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [3]. Also, childhood adiposity is a potential risk factor for being obese at older ages and is related to a higher rate of morbidity and mortality in adulthood [4].",5c64faed-d1bb-41fd-990c-fe70c375bde2
4,results2," Based on global estimations, the number of children and adolescents with overweight and obesity will be, respectively, 268 and 145 million by 2025 [5]. Approximately 4 million Iranian children and adolescents have been estimated to be overweight and obese by the year 2025 [6]. Along with the excess accumulation of fat in overweight and obese individuals, their metabolic status should be taken into account [7].  Metabolically healthy overweight or obese (metabolically healthy obese (MHO)) is defined as a situation in which metabolic abnormalities such as elevated fasting blood glucose and blood pressure do not exist concurrently with adiposity [8]. Whereas, higher levels of fasting glucose, triglyceride, and blood pressure do occur in metabolically unhealthy overweight or obese (metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO)) individuals [8, 9].",2686cc8d-4e0d-467f-ab86-1147e3ad424b
5,results3," Despite a possible heredity origin for metabolically healthy obese (MHO), previous studies have indicated that lifestyle factors might also contribute to the presence of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) phenotypes [10]. It is also noteworthy to consider the synergistic effect of dietary intakes and other lifestyle factors on cardiometabolic status [11, 12].  Although higher fruits and vegetables intake has been assumed to be linked to optimal body weight in children, a review study indicated that more evidence is needed to support such an association [13]. Furthermore, a cross-sectional study found no significant difference between intake of specific food groups and metabolically healthy obese (MHO)/metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) status [14].",3cca56b1-5374-4a84-92a6-9710984c9e59
6,results4," However, the nutritional profile of individuals comes from their whole diet, and therefore, taking overall dietary intake into account should be acknowledged. It has been indicated that the metabolically healthy obese (MHO) phenotype is positively associated with better overall dietary quality [15]. Among dietary patterns, great attention have been recently paid to the Mediterranean diet [16]. The Mediterranean diet recommends high consumption of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, and olive oil; a moderate intake of fish; and low consumption of dairy products as well as red and processed meats [17]. Numerous studies have proposed a significant association between the Mediterranean diet and childhood obesity [18–20]. Furthermore, Lopez et al. reported that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been associated with decreased glucose levels and body mass index in obese children and adolescents [21].",095b62d1-7475-4d1a-9296-30453504becc
7,results5," Similarly, another cross-sectional study has suggested that individuals with higher adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern were less likely to have an unfavorable metabolic profile [22]. However, the findings of some studies were not in line with these results [23, 24]. Also, considering the high prevalence of overweight and obesity and the subsequent complications among adolescents, investigating the relation of dietary intakes of overweight and obese adolescents with their metabolic health status has considerable importance. As far as we know, the relationship between the Mediterranean dietary pattern and metabolically healthy obese (MHO)/metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) phenotypes in children and adolescents has received limited attention. Moreover, the majority of earlier studies were done among the European or American populations [22, 25].",f311061e-d721-460f-b2b1-80e0d48fbbde
8,results6," Few investigations in this regard have been established in the Middle Eastern region, where dietary intakes are mainly different from Western countries. Therefore, we investigated the association between the Mediterranean diet and healthy or unhealthy phenotypes in Iranian overweight/obese adolescents.  2. Methods  2.1. Participants  The present cross-sectional study was performed among 203 Iranian adolescents (102 girls and 101 boys) aged 12–18 years. The sample size of the current study was calculated based on the previously published investigations [26, 27], which have shown approximately 60% of overweight and obese adolescents suffered from metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO). Thus, considering a power of 80% and type I error of 0.05, desired confidence interval of 0.95, and precision (d) of 7%, the minimum required sample size was calculated to be 188 subjects. Participants were chosen by the multistage cluster randomly sampled method.",c66fe2e8-db6a-4467-a1c5-d44ed44b722b
9,results7," Students were selected randomly from sixteen schools in five principal regions of Isfahan, Iran. The weight and height of subjects were measured. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height squared (m2) for all students. Then, students were classified as normal weight, overweight, and obese based on the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) age and sex-standardized Body mass index (BMI) percentiles [28]. Students who were overweight or obese were invited to participate in the current study. Using this approach, adolescents from a wide range of social and economic statuses were included. Participants who were on a weight-loss diet, those who consume vitamin and mineral supplements, or use medications that might influence body weight, blood glucose, lipid profile, or hypertension were not included.",c644bf50-743f-4c73-aa15-12218fb17b84
10,results8," Furthermore, we did not include students with genetic or endocrine problems (such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and Cushing syndrome) in the study. Finally, 203 overweight/obese adolescents were recruited for our study. The written informed agreement was obtained from each participant and his/her parents. The study protocol has been authorized by the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences' Local Ethics Committee.  2.2. Dietary Intake Assessment  A validated 147-item food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) was used to collect data on participants' dietary intakes during the preceding year [29]. This food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was formerly validated among Iranian adolescents [29]. In addition, previous investigations revealed that this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) could reasonably indicate usual dietary intakes and their relations with various disorders among Iranian adolescents [30, 31].",36c2d883-d806-490a-bb57-bedb5b7b4e93
11,results9," Thus, reasonable validity and reliability were documented for the applied food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). A trained nutritionist has completed this food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for all participants. Consumption of each food was requested to report based on a daily, weekly, or monthly frequency. Afterward, using household measurements, portion amounts of consumed items were converted to grams per day [32]. The Nutritionist IV software which was based on the USDA food composition database, but was modified for some Iranian foods, was used to calculate nutrients intake.  2.3. Assessment of Adherence to the Mediterranean diet  According to the method developed by Trichopoulou et al. [17], we calculated Mediterranean dietary scores (Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS)) based on nine components (including vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, fish, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) to saturated fatty acids (SFAs) ratio, grains, meats, and dairy products).",fdd0bb34-85e8-4aed-ac4d-706bced62a45
12,results10," Participants received a score of 1 if they were in the top median consumption of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, fish, and MUFAs to SFAs ratio and the bottom median intake of grains, meats, and dairy products. A score of zero was assigned to participants who were in the top median intake of grains, meats and dairy and the bottom median intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, fish, and MUFAs to SFAs ratio. The overall Mediterranean diet score for each individual was computed by summing the scores of all nine components. Due to the low consumption of whole grains in Iranian society (10 grams per day), whole and refined grains were combined as a single group of grains in this study [33, 34]. Because of the association between refined grains and several chronic diseases [34, 35], we classified grains as a nonhealthy food group.  2.4.",079598f0-902b-4f65-ab38-84fde048eaa1
13,results11," Assessment of Anthropometric Indices and Cardio Metabolic Risk Factors  A trained nutritionist used a stadimeter to measure standing height without shoes (to the nearest 0.1 cm). Weight was also measured with a calibrated electronic scale to the nearest 0.1 kg in minimal clothing and without shoes. After normal respiration and without putting any pressure on the body surface, the waist circumference (WC) was measured with a flexible tape (to the nearest 0.1 cm). A Mercury sphygmomanometer with a suitable cuff size was used to measure systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) on the right arm, twice after a 15-minute recovery time. The average of the two measurements was calculated and used in this study. Blood samples were drawn from all participants after 12 hours of overnight fasting.",1a6264b6-9980-4dd0-bbe7-23d7631b641b
14,results12," The concentrations of serum triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), fasting blood glucose (fasting blood glucose (FBG)), and insulin were measured. Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was determined using the following formula to measure insulin resistance (IR) [36]: [(fasting insulin (mU/L) × fasting blood glucose (FBG) (mmol/L)]/22.5.  2.5. Assessment of Metabolic Status  To classify participants as metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) individuals, two strategies were applied. The first approach was similar to the definition of metabolic syndrome (MetS) based on the children's International Diabetes Federation (International Diabetes Federation (IDF)) criteria [37].",60440fea-06cc-43a4-946c-7db80196a8b1
15,results13," Being obese without having other MetS components or having only one component of MetS was considered metabolically healthy obese (MHO); while metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) children were identified by having two or more MetS components, including increased triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL), decreased HDL-c (<40 mg/dL for the age of <16 y and <50 mg/dL in girls/< 40 mg/dL in boys for the age of ≥16 y), increased fasting blood glucose (≥100 mg/dL), and elevated blood pressure (≥130/85 mmHg). In the second method, HOMA-IR was considered along with International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria that were used in the first classification method. Individuals with HOMA-IR ≥ 3.16 who had at least two metabolic risk factors were classified as metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) and those with HOMA-IR < 3.16 were considered as metabolically healthy obese (MHO) [9, 38].  2.6.",5a8f7a03-ad0c-4300-a3a8-e8ef418e1b47
16,results14," Assessment of Other Variables  The Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A) was applied to assess the participants' physical activity [39]. This questionnaire consists of a 9-item estimating physical activity levels in the last week. The first 8 items asked individuals about (1) spare time activities (i.e., soccer, jogging, swimming, and walking for exercise); their activity during (2) physical education classes, (3) lunch, (4) right after school, (5) evenings, and (6) the last weekend; (7) how they describe their physical activity; and (8) the levels of activity in each day. The first 8 items of the PAQ-A were scored from 1 to 5; a score of 1 indicated the lowest and 5 showed the highest level of physical activity. The average score of all weekdays was considered for the last item. The ninth question evaluated the unusual activity of adolescents during the previous 7 days and was not included in the total score calculation.",f0ee281c-c711-49ca-a0a2-698995f67043
17,results15," Finally, participants were classified based on the sum of the scores, as sedentary or not having an orderly week activity (score<2), less active (3<score≤2), active (score≥3), and very active (score≥4). Since a small number of participants were categorized as sedentary and very active, we combined sedentary with less active and active with very active levels to have two final categories (low and high levels of physical activity). A questionnaire was used to record the participants' age, gender, medical history, medication, and supplement use. A validated demographic questionnaire was used by trained researchers to evaluate the socioeconomic status (socioeconomic status (SES)) [40], based on the following variables: parental job, family size, parental education level, having cars in the family, having computers/laptops, having personal room, and taking trips in the year. First, each of these variables was categorized by ordinal scores.",8e4d9055-a06e-4784-88f6-af7c3b543df8
18,results16," Then, these scores were summed up to calculate a total score of socioeconomic status (SES). Finally, subjects were classified into three levels of socioeconomic status (SES) (low, moderate, and high).  2.7. Statistical Analysis  The residual method was used to compute energy-adjusted Mediterranean dietary scores. Then, we classified participants based on energy-adjusted tertiles of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS). General characteristics of study participants across tertiles of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) were reported as means ± SDs for continuous and percentages for categorical variables. To examine the differences across tertiles of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS), we used a one-way analysis of variance (a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) for continuous and chi-square tests for categorical variables.",11c0fcf5-9671-494e-8c26-b54322f5af49
19,results17," We also used analysis of covariance (also used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)) to calculate energy, age, and sex-adjusted dietary intakes of Mediterranean diet components and select nutrients of participants across tertiles of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS). To identify the association between tertiles of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) and metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) phenotype, multivariable logistic regression was applied in different models. The odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) status were calculated in crude and adjusted models. In the first model, adjustments were done for age, gender, and energy intake. In the second model, further adjustments for physical activity level and socioeconomic status (SES) were done. In the last model, Body mass index (BMI) was added to the previous adjustments.",1c777abc-9e0e-490e-914b-1abec48a7dd6
20,results18," In all models, the first tertile of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) was considered as the reference category. The odds of having metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) phenotype according to both aforementioned criteria were calculated. Furthermore, we removed each component of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) at a time from Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) calculation to estimate the effect of that component. Tertiles of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) were considered as an ordinal variable to examine the trend of odds ratios. SPSS software version 26 (IBM, Chicago, IL) was used for all analyses. P values <0.05 (two-sided) were considered as statistically significant.  3. Results  3.1. General Characteristics of the Study Participants  General characteristics and cardiometabolic factors of the study participants across tertiles of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) are given in Table 1.",50b8239a-ebb4-47c9-80b2-a1072b776bec
21,results19," Adolescents with the greatest adherence to the Mediterranean diet were more likely to have higher physical activity levels, socioeconomic status levels, and HDL as well as lower systolic blood pressure (mmHg), fasting blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and triglyceride levels, compared to the lowest adherence (all P values<0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in weight, age, Body mass index (BMI), gender, and diastolic blood pressure across tertiles of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS).  3.2. Dietary Intakes of Study Participants  Dietary intakes of study participants according to the tertiles of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) are given in Table 2.",930509b4-796f-45db-87d8-15efc02f463c
22,results20," Participants in the top tertile of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS), compared to those in the bottom tertile, had higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, fish, MUFA/SFA, proteins, fats, dietary fibers, omega-3 fatty acids, and magnesium as well as lower consumption of grains, carbohydrates, and vitamin B1 (all P values<0.05). No significant differences were observed in energy, meats, and dairy product intake across tertiles of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS).  The prevalence of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) according to the tertiles of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) is shown in Figure 1. Based on the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria, the prevalence of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) phenotype in the third tertile of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) was lower than in the first tertile (60.9 vs. 21.0%, P < 0.001).",5d36cf7e-1b7a-4008-9e4b-114b38d116cb
23,results21," A similar result was seen when International Diabetes Federation (IDF)/HOMA-IR definition was considered (51.6 vs. 19.4%, P < 0.001).  3.3.

Considering International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definition, the top tertile of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) was associated with decreased odds of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) status in the crude model (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.08–0.37). This association remained significant after including age, gender, and energy intake as confounders in the first model (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08–0.43).",cdcd2cb1-a17d-466e-aed8-ade70324ba9a
24,results22," Also, associations were significant after more adjustments for physical activity and socioeconomic status (SES) in the second model (OR, 034; 95% CI, 0.13–0.86), and physical activity, socioeconomic status (SES), and Body mass index (BMI) in the last model (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13–0.84). For the International Diabetes Federation (IDF)/HOMA-IR definition, a significant association was observed between the highest tertile of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS), compared to the lowest one, and the odds of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) in the crude model (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10–0.50). Also, after considering age, gender, and energy intake as the covariates, a significant association was observed (OR, 0.26; 95% CI: 0.11–0.61). However, results did not remain significant in the second and third models.",f95aaa60-a2f1-4e60-9aee-891f2c907ab2

However, after adjustments for confounding variables, significant associations were only observed after removing meats (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16–0.92) and dairy products (0.38; 95% CI, 0.16–0.91) from the dietary pattern. Table 5 provides ORs for being metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) (based on International Diabetes Federation (IDF)/HOMA-IR criteria) across the Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS), after removing each Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) component at a time, from the total score.",c49242c7-e667-43db-9c56-0469defbfb97

However, after controlling potential confounders, no significant relation was found.  4. Discussion  In the current cross-sectional study, we found that adolescents with the greatest adherence to the Mediterranean diet had lower odds of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) compared with those with the lowest adherence, based on International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria for metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) phenotype. This association remained significant even after adjustments for potential confounders.

27,results25," On the other hand, the association between Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) and metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO), based on International Diabetes Federation (IDF)/HOMA-IR definition, was dependent on covariates. To the best of our knowledge, this population-based study was the first one examining the Mediterranean diet in relation to metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) phenotype among Iranian adolescents.  According to a longitudinal study, almost half of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals maintained their metabolic health status in the following years of their lives [41]. It should be highlighted that metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals could develop a metabolically unfavorable phenotype [42]. This condition might lead to a higher risk of morbidity and a reduction in life expectancy [43].",5a08a762-af67-4e64-bc70-0e0f10e70977
28,results26," We found an inverse association between the Mediterranean diet and metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) in the current investigation. Hence, it is noteworthy to clinically recommend adolescents to enhance the quality of their diet in order to prevent developing metabolic comorbidities of obesity.  Several previous studies have investigated diet quality in relation to metabolically unhealthy obesity [24, 44]. The association between “priori” dietary scores and metabolic health status in children and adolescents has been adequately addressed [44, 45]. The findings indicated that more adherence to a healthy eating pattern could shift obesity type from metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) to metabolically healthy obese (MHO) [46]. While the benefits of the Mediterranean diet were widely understood in adults [47], limited data were known regarding this association in children and adolescents.",1ff19f3c-4be7-4eeb-bc31-19d3a75a8e53
29,results27," Findings of the current study indicated that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet might be a protective determinant for metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO), based on International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definition, among adolescents. However, when we used International Diabetes Federation (IDF)/HOMA definition for metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO), we found no significant association between Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) and metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) status. Based on the latter definition, adolescents were categorized as metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO)/metabolically healthy obese (MHO) with the consideration of abnormal HOMA-IR in combination with International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria.",1e4a4a12-540d-4132-ac1b-a79bac14683e
30,results28," Some of the metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) cases who were diagnosed based on International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria had normal HOMA-IR and, therefore, were categorized as metabolically healthy obese (MHO) adolescents in the second definition. Thus, relatively few numbers of cases, which were diagnosed by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF)/HOMA criteria, could explain the nonsignificant association between Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) and metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO). Similar to our findings, a cross-sectional study among 137 overweight/obese European adolescents found an inverse association between the Mediterranean diet and metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) [22]; the dietary intakes of these adolescents had been assessed by two nonconsecutive 24-hour recalls [22].",9fab98f2-74ff-45da-9d09-825d9324ff59
31,results29," Furthermore, in a cross-sectional study on 793 American adolescents with diabetes, food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to determine dietary intakes [48]. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet among these American adolescents was related to improved glycemic control and a preferable lipid profile [48]. On the other hand, a prospective cohort study revealed that a pattern characterized as energy-dense, high in fat, and poor in fiber could be linked to cardiometabolic abnormalities such as elevated insulin levels and insulin resistance [49]. However, according to the findings from a cross-sectional study among 6964 obese American women, dietary intakes were not substantially different between metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) participants [50]. Also, in a study among Iranian adults, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet did not indicate a decreased incidence of metabolic syndrome features [51].",2131d922-d618-4bdc-9c66-2d42ce5d594b
32,results30," The observed discrepancies among findings of previous studies could be clarified by different study designs, study populations, applied questionnaires, and different approaches used in statistical analyses. Furthermore, methods for Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) construction varied among the previous studies. Some studies have considered medians of food groups to define Mediterranean diet scores, while others have used tertiles of intake to construct Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS). Also, differences in the components of the Mediterranean diet might be a reason for these inconsistent findings. Some studies that were conducted in the Mediterranean area included olive oil in the score; whereas, MUFA or the ratio of MUFA to SFA was considered as a component of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) in non-Mediterranean populations. Therefore, the findings of previous investigations should be cautiously compared.",fca34416-c17d-4254-933b-60b1904bf041
33,results31,"  The cumulative effect of an overall dietary pattern is likely to be stronger than the effect of its individual components [52]. In the current study, after excluding meats and dairy products from Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS), the magnitude of the associations was slightly attenuated, but still remained significant. However, such findings were not observed by exclusion of other components of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS). We also observed that meats and dairy intakes were not substantially different across tertiles of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS). Therefore, they might be less important components of the Mediterranean diet than others in relation to metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO). Further studies should be conducted to shed a light on the importance of each component of the Mediterranean diet in relation to health status.",3f3398f7-b66b-4b6e-8de1-f52694f1d5ec
34,results32,"  Various underlying mechanisms might explain the observed inverse association between the Mediterranean diet and metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) phenotype, although the exact ones are unknown. The Mediterranean diet has an abundance of plant foods that are rich in antioxidants such as flavonoids, carotenoids, tocopherols, and ascorbic acid [53]. Antioxidants can scavenge free radicals and reduce oxidative stress [53–55]. It is well documented that oxidative stress could be an underlying factor in the development of metabolic disorders [56]. Another probable mechanism is that the Mediterranean diet, characterized by high consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes, provides considerable amounts of dietary fiber [57]. Diets rich in fibers could enhance the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gut bacteria [57]. SCFAs could improve glucose and lipid metabolism in many tissues [57].",b450c00c-5983-40d7-bdff-3312d73680f1

Additionally, adhering to the Mediterranean diet has been inversely related to systemic inflammation [59]. Fish and nuts, as two elements of Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS), are rich sources of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and could suppress inflammatory processes and enhance endothelial function [60].  The current investigation has some strengths and weaknesses. To our knowledge, this is the first study that examined the association between the Mediterranean diet and metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) among Iranian adolescents. In addition, several potential confounders were taken into account during the analysis. Last, the study was conducted in the Middle East region where available data on diet-disease interaction are limited. However, when interpreting our findings, some limitations must be considered.",5c065aaf-c7c4-4f76-b79a-c4ccb04f7ae7
36,results34," Our study has a cross-sectional design and we could not infer a causal relationship between the Mediterranean diet and metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO). Therefore, prospective cohort studies are needed to affirm a causal relationship between the Mediterranean diet and metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO). Also, because of using food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to evaluate dietary intakes, possible misclassification of subjects was inevitable. Although we assessed Body mass index (BMI) and WC to determine obesity and abdominal obesity, we could not evaluate body composition and fat distribution, which could be important in determining metabolic health status. Finally, despite adjustment for several covariates, residual confounders (such as paternal obesity, and sleep disorders) might affect the findings.",ad1b0754-2b91-4fb7-8346-696855551851
37,results35,"  In conclusion, we found an inverse relationship between the Mediterranean dietary pattern and odds of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) among Iranian adolescents based on International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definition. However, no significant association was found between Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) and metabolically healthy obese (MHO) or unhealthy obese (MUO) phenotypes, considering International Diabetes Federation (IDF)/HOMA-IR criteria. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean dietary scores (MDS) might be beneficial in maintaining metabolic health among overweight/obese adolescents. More prospective studies among different nations are required to confirm these findings. ",df523ad2-cb54-4cc1-9df1-79ef18803fe2
