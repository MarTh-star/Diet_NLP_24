0,introduction0,"In Systems Medicine, human being is considered as a complex of cells functionally connected, organized and integrated together, with the aim of maintaining a dynamic stability through continuous adapting to the external environment. Overweight and obesity could unsettle this equilibrium predisposing to metabolic syndrome and development of chronic diseases .  The pathogenesis for overweight, obesity and some metabolic diseases is multifactorial, involving a complex interaction of genetic, socio-economic, behavioral and environmental aspects. Recently, several studies shed light on a possible correlation between these pathological conditions and alterations in the Gut Microbiota (GM) composition. For instance, evidence indicates beneficial and/or harmful effects on some chronic diseases related with GM differential composition. Furthermore, modification of GM is associated with increased risk of metabolic and immune disorders in animals and humans (Boulangé et al.",2d084706-5d9d-4c4d-902b-3e75a55ead76
1,introduction1,", 2016). High fat and high sugar diets may alter intestinal microbiota independently from differences in host genotype, causing modifications responsible for some of the medical disorders observed in metabolic syndrome .  In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, GM was described as one of the most important risk factors affecting obesity , whereby distal GM of obese subjects is different in the relative composition and abundance of bacteria in comparison with non-obese subjects .  Native bacteria are mainly acquired at birth and during the first year of life, whereas transient bacteria, the most part of GM, are continuously ingested with food and drinks and their number and composition is modified by life style .",8a06fcbd-aff2-4943-b263-e82e3575a4c7
2,introduction2," Among these microorganisms, Lactic Acid Bacteria (Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)) include a large number of genera such as lactobacilli considered as safe for their hosts, and implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of clinical conditions as diverse as obesity, Cardio Vascular Disease (Cardio Vascular Disease (CVD)), inflammatory bowel diseases ; moreover, complex molecular cross-talk between Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and host has been demonstrated. Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) produce moonlighting proteins, promote bacterial adhesion to mucosa and stimulate immune cells in response to gut stimuli, and are considered antioxidant and nutraceutical vectors (Pessione, 2012).",493a3de9-fe62-4d6a-9a9d-31cf72dfbe9f
3,introduction3,"  Interest for Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and their potential has recently increased since they were recognized as probiotic agents with an important role in the animal gut ecosystem, as demonstrated in different studies on germ free animals which showed their need of an additional nutritional intake to maintain their ideal weight (Kallus and Brandt, 2012). Previous publications demonstrate that diet consistently influences the intestinal ecosystem and functional capacity of GM of adults and children (Delzenne et al., 2011; Danneskiold-Samsøe et al., 2019).  The Mediterranean Diet (MD) is the gold standard for a healthy nutrition and it is associated with reduced risk of metabolic disease. Its beneficial effect has been attributed not only to macronutrients but also to micronutrients as well as prebiotics, probiotics and other components which can modulate GM.",e75f7bbf-4aa4-4986-8844-b04b343fb5d0
4,introduction4," As one of the main constituent of MD, Extra Virgin Olive Oil has a major beneficial role attributed to oleic acid and to polyphenols, that exert antioxidant activity positively influencing several biomarkers of oxidative damage (Hidalgo et al., 2014; Trichopoulou et al., 2014; Gambino et al., 2017; Estruch et al., 2018; Danneskiold-Samsøe et al., 2019)  These polyphenols are directly absorbed or metabolized in the intestine or transformed in active metabolites where they might exert a significant local action in relation to their interaction with the GM. They potentially modulate the oxidative status of intestinal barrier, inflammation and immune response of the host .  There is growing evidence that inflammation and oxidative stress are closely related, creating a vicious circle that can aggravate metabolic disease.",1de0e073-9750-47e0-9e08-1022da4b4b4d
5,introduction5," A low grade inflammation is associated to obesity and adipose tissue releases many active mediators, such as leptin and adiponectin, as well as classical pro-inflammatory cytokines (Feillet-Coudray et al., 2019).  Based on this evidence, the aim of this research was to study, if and how, some parameters of inflammation and oxidative stress and GM’s Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) number copies, change after 3 months of MD rich in High Quality-Extra Virgin Olive Oil (HQ-EVOO) in a cohort of overweight/obese subjects in comparison with normal weight controls. The HQ-EVOO is defined according to the Italian regulation of “high quality” extra virgin olive oil (Annex A) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Forestry and Tourism.

The phenolic fraction of HQ-EVOO, besides oleic acid, also acts as promoting factor of growth or survival for beneficial gut bacteria, mainly Lactobacillus strains, and inhibiting the proliferation of some pathogenic bacteria (Martín-Peláez et al., 2017).  The use of the rpoB gene in qPCR, the most quantitative and reliable tool to determine bacterial concentrations in environmental and clinical samples, allowed to refer directly to the number of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) because this gene is present in single copy in the bacterial genome. In this work, the gut biomass as a whole, calculated by the dsDNA extracted from feces, did not significantly differ between cases and controls during the experiment.",7480a1f5-d5d9-455c-b6cb-30eb1a3ffa90
31,discussion4," However, what caught our attention was, instead, the amount of rpoB sequences that is the significant increment of the number of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) at the end of the monitoring diet period, in both cases and controls. At T0 the amount of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) was not significantly different between controls and cases, but at T1, the presence of these bacterial population increased significantly in both groups and particularly in cases and in a relatively short period of time.  Although gender and age variations influence GM (Spychala et al., 2018; Santos-Marcos et al., 2019), in the present study these stratification analyses were not performed for the reduced number of the enrolled subjects; however, the higher effect of MD rich in HQ-EVOO, on anti-inflammatory cytokines and Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), observed in overweight/obese than in normal weight subjects, indicates the validity of our hypothesis.",1eeeda53-a3b2-439b-9d73-d8f851934f0a
32,discussion5," Further investigation is needed to clarify the etiopathogenetic mechanism.  In conclusion, obesity, metabolic disease and inflammation are considered to be nutrition-related disorders and recent evidence indicates that GM plays a major role both in disease development and in wellness. Dietary polyphenols, such as those present in High Quality-Extra Virgin Olive Oil, are substrates that seem to contribute to the maintenance of GM, mainly Lactobacillus strains, and thus, exerting prebiotic actions. There are still few human trials that have been carried out to test the efficacy of MD as anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory treatment by inducing a modification of Lactic Acid Bacteria.",e9cabe3f-f565-4324-b62c-4361fb844c49
33,discussion6," Our results, supporting the role of GM as an important element in the regulation of energy homeostasis, contribute to unveil the potential role of the MD focused on HQ-EVOO rich in polyphenols use, as a possible diet-related intervention, for decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress both in normal and overweight/obese subjects in prevention and rehabilitation.
