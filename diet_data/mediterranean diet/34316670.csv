Study Population  The cross-sectional data were obtained from the China Nutrition and Health Surveillance (CNHS) 2015–2017, this survey conducted among Chinese people enrolled in 2015–2017 and supported by the Ethics Committee of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (approval number: 201519-B). A stratified, multistage, and random sampling method was applied to include a representative sample from 31 provinces/ municipalities/ autonomous in China mainland. The aim of this survey was to obtain the information of dietary intake, lifestyle habits, medical examination, as well as disease condition and related risk factors among all-age Chinese people, further information about China Nutrition and Health Surveillance (CNHS) is available elsewhere [22]. At the beginning of the study, we included 78,480 participants in total.",8207baa4-b92b-4b12-9996-332e852abbbd

Finally, 61,747 participants were included in this study, and all of them had signed the informed consent before the survey.  2.2. Basic Information Interview  Well-trained health investigators collected all the basic information, including socioeconomic status and lifestyle behavior. To avoid incorrect filling and improve the authenticity and accuracy of the survey, the whole survey was conducted face-to-face and recorded by the investigators. After that, multi-level quality control was carried out by professional stuff from the national and local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)).  2.3.",e27eb149-431c-4767-8782-0eccc8fe7cd9

To control measurement bias, unified standardized equipment, and machines of the same type and brand were used in all the monitoring locations. Two well-trained local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staffs measured height (accurate to 0.1 cm), body weight (accurate to 0.1 kg), and blood pressure (accurate to 1 mmHg) together. For laboratory test, 8 mL of overnight fasting blood was used to test all the blood indices, i.e., fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL-C), High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL-C), serum uric acid, and glycohemoglobin.

3,methods3," Dietary Assessment  A validated semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) was applied to reflect dietary habits during the past 12 months in China Nutrition and Health Surveillance (CNHS) 2015–2017 [23]. Sixty-four kinds of food, including staple foods, vegetables, fruits, animal and aquatic products, eggs, legumes and mixed beans, dairy products, soft and alcoholic beverages, etc., were surveyed and integrated into 28 food items in current study. The daily consuming weight of the above food items was aggregated based on their daily/weekly/monthly/yearly consuming frequency and consumption in a single time. To estimate daily dietary energy and nutrients intake more accurately, according to the monthly consumption records of the edible oil and condiments and the frequency of family members eating at home during the last month, the average daily intake of edible oil and other condiments was calculated.",17ba3350-9858-4dfb-8282-6e0494bee2dd

While the parts supplied from nutrient supplements were omitted.  2.5. Definition of hypertension (HTN) and Other NCDs  Systolic Blood Pressure (Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)) were obtained due to the average value of the three-time measurement. hypertension (HTN) was defined as Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and (or) Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg and (or) taking anti-hypertension (HTN) medication within two weeks [26]. Our study included other health outcomes, such as Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and hyperlipidemic. In addition to participants who had been diagnosed by a township health center/community health service center/higher-level medical institute or taken related-disease medical treatment, we also defined participants whose serum total cholesterol ≥ 6.",85362a03-647f-480f-853f-b7eafa14a61b

Moreover, well-controlled hypertension (HTN) was defined as participants who had been previously diagnosed with hypertension (HTN) and reported taking anti-hypertension (HTN) medication within two weeks whose current Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) < 140 mmHg and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) < 90 mmHg [26,28].  2.6. Dietary Pattern Analysis  reduced rank regression (RRR) is a recently emerging method applied in dietary pattern analysis [20]. Unlike the traditional dietary pattern analysis, reduced rank regression (RRR) could combine the advantage of both the priori and posterior methods.",2a9113f5-953c-4814-a1b7-1c7b9d1c9248
6,methods6," It selects response variables (such as nutrients and biomarkers) based on the prior knowledge as the intermediate variables between the food groups and target outcome. It could recognize the food groups with collinearity to maximumly explain the variance of response variables and examine the mechanistic pathway from diet to aim outcomes [29,30].  Nutrients including thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin C, Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, and dietary fiber from diet have been reported to have protective effects on the risk of hypertension (HTN) due to either genetic or metabolic mechanisms [31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40]. Before reduced rank regression (RRR) analysis, we conducted a preliminary analysis of our study population, and all these nutrients were inversely associated with blood pressure.

The first dietary pattern was retained for further analysis since it explained the largest variation of the response variables [29]. A food item with absolute factor loading over 0.1 was used to describe the characteristics of the dietary pattern. Higher absolute factor loading of food items reflects higher consumption, and the dietary score was calculated by standardized food intakes and their weight within the dietary pattern [21].",7a637ed8-5f11-46be-bb90-352534fff8f4
8,methods8," Participants were afterward divided into quintile groups due to dietary scores to conduct further analysis.  Moreover, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-score was also applied in the study to evaluate its relationship with the risk of hypertension (HTN) among the participants in China Nutrition and Health Surveillance (CNHS) 2015–2017 and test whether the derived dietary pattern had conformity with it since the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is widely reported to have benefits for blood pressure control [42].",ac37c649-b02f-49b5-a93a-e45262db3e40

Further information on Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-score is available in the previous study [44]. Participants were also divided into quintile groups due to Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-score to conduct further analysis.  2.7.

Model I is the crude model without adjusting any covariates, model II is adjusted by gender, age, and Body Mass Index (BMI), and model III is further adjusted by remaining covariables.  Subgroup analysis was conducted to test the interaction between dietary pattern score and risk of hypertension (HTN) with gender (male/female), age (18~<30, 30~<45, 45~<60, ≥ 60 years), physical activity (low, medium, high), current smoker (yes/no), DM (yes/no), and hyperlipidemic (yes/no) by comparing the highest quintile group with the lowest in full-adjustment logistic regression.",b3abdcb2-8946-4b30-85c3-be5c63ab0f71
13,methods13,"  Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was also conducted to robust our results. First, we further adjusted DM and hyperlipidemia in model III to examine the association between dietary scores and hypertension (HTN). Then, we used completed participants by excluding those did not report household income and were pre-diagnosed with hypertension (HTN) to perform multiple-adjustment logistic regression.  SAS v. 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all the statistical analyses in this study, of all the analyses, statistical significance was defined as a two-sided p value less than 0.05.  3. Results  3.1. Dietary Pattern Extracted by reduced rank regression (RRR)  The first dietary pattern explained 66.08% variation of response and 5.",567e7c65-cc64-4f20-82f9-f835e2ec9a3c

For each response variable, the dietary pattern explained variation varies from 81.05% (for Potassium) to 25.29% (for thiamin), and all of them had a positive correlation with the dietary score. Therefore, we initially named the first dietary pattern (DP1) derived by reduced rank regression (RRR) method as diet beneficial for blood pressure (Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet) for further step of analysis.

As the results shown in Table 1, those participants in the highest quintile had lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure. They were more likely to be female, live in the urban areas, have higher socioeconomic levels, adequate sleeping duration, higher Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-score, and received medical examinations within one year, but they also have higher Body Mass Index (BMI) and longer sedentary behavior. Meanwhile, the highest quintile had fewer participants who were current smokers, exposed to second-hand smoke, and excessive alcohol drinking. As for outcomes, compared to the lowest quintile, there was fewer patients with hypertension (HTN), but more proportion of DM, hyperlipidemic, and those who had family history of hypertension (HTN) in the highest quintile.  3.3.",ea94e9cf-9826-4a0c-aa0f-02a7bc417224
16,methods16," Food and Nutrients Daily Intake of Participants in Quintile Groups  For daily food intake, participants with higher Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet score were more likely to consume those foods with higher factor loadings (≥0.1). They consumed less refined grains and pork, the food item with negative factor loadings. Interestingly, although some food items with higher absolute factor loadings, their median values were all equal or near to zero, such as dried fruits, western staples, and alcohol, making it hard to compare actual intakes between different quintile groups. As for daily nutrient intake, except for total energy, fat, carbohydrate, and sodium, all the other nutrients achieved significantly higher intakes in the highest quintile.

For Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-score, a negative association between Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-diet and hypertension (HTN) also showed in the full-adjustment logistic model (Q5 vs. Q1, OR = 0.912, 95% CI = 0.854–0.973, p-trend = 0.0063).  3.5.

18,methods18," The protective effect on hypertension (HTN) was observed regardless of gender, the level of physical activity, smoking status, and with hyperlipidemic or not, but the higher protective effects still showed among those who were males (males: OR = 0.819 vs. females: OR = 0.906, p for interaction = 0.7001). Moreover, significant results only showed in participants aged over 45 years (45~<60 years: OR = 0.881; ≥60 years: OR = 0.784), while potential effect modified by age group was not observed (p for interaction = 0.1254). For the subgroups divided by DM, the protective effect of the Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet on hypertension (HTN) tended to be more pronounced in participants who were DM patients (p for interaction < 0.0001).  3.6. Sensitivity Analysis  Results of sensitivity analysis were shown in Supplemental Table S5.",4f58c9bb-0854-45d0-97db-8805674844b2

Association between Dietary Scores and Well-Controlled hypertension (HTN)  Moreover, among those hypertension (HTN) patients who received medical treatment within two weeks, the association between dietary scores and well-controlled hypertension (HTN) was also analyzed. The results were shown in Table 3. For the Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet derived from reduced rank regression (RRR), patients in the highest quintile tended to have a higher probability of getting well-controlled (Q5 vs. Q1, OR = 0.762, 95% CI = 0.629–0.924, p-trend = 0.002).",39dd5d8e-300a-437b-a13c-750473dc934d
20,methods20," The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was also observed to have protective effects on hypertension (HTN) control (Q5 vs. Q1, OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.616–0.938, p-trend = 0.009).  4. Discussion  From this nationwide cross-sectional study, we identified the dietary pattern by reduced rank regression (RRR) method which was named as Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet. This pattern was characterized by higher fresh vegetables and fruits, mushrooms/edible fungi, dairy products, seaweeds, fresh eggs, dried fruits, nuts and seeds, legumes and related products, aquatic products, coarse cereals, western staples, and less refined grains and alcohol consumption. It positively correlated with the intakes of thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin C, Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, and dietary fiber which were selected as the response variables could serve as protective factors in hypertension (HTN).",1c01134b-8a8e-4f2a-bd6e-620b72d82256
21,methods21," After multiple adjustments, a higher Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet score was found a protective effects on both risk for hypertension (HTN) and its control, which indicated its potential role for hypertension (HTN) prevention and management in the further applications.  The Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet has high conformity with Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-diet and Mediterranean diet which were widely reported to possibly be beneficial for cardiovascular health [14,42,47], all of which were represented by limited calories and sodium intake, higher consumption of vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, coarse cereals, aquatic products, less refined grains, and red meat. Moreover, we also identified extra food items which also showed relative higher consumption within Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet, including mushrooms/edible fungi, seaweeds, and fresh eggs.",bebc28e0-45f0-40b3-bed9-398942d83a53
22,methods22," Although dried fruits, western staples, and alcohol also had higher absolute factor loadings, the median daily intake did not show an obvious difference between quintile groups. Thus, it is hard to reflect the significant dietary difference by the intake of dried fruits and western staples among our samples. However, when we considered the condition of excess alcohol drinking, which is one of the risk factors for hypertension (HTN) [4], the results showed there were less participants who drank alcohol excessively with the increase of Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet score.  In some countries like China, Japan, and Korea, due to the flavor and general consideration of health effects, bacteria and algae foods are widely consumed in daily diet, and they are rich in several important vitamins, minerals, as well as dietary fiber which are essential for human health [48,49].",04a232bf-bf2d-4770-bcc7-9b5bc7fc8fd8
23,methods23," As previous research reported, a variety of mushrooms and seaweeds contain anti-hypertension (HTN) bio-components which could regulate the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS)) by inhibiting the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)) and further exert their effect on blood pressure controlling [50,51]. Several studies had revealed the protective role of these foods on reducing blood pressure, prolonging life-expectancy and preventing cardiovascular and further diseases [52,53,54]. Furthermore, edible mushrooms had been also reported to be beneficial for regulating intestinal microflora which could also serve as a protective factor for the prevention on a host of diseases [55]. For fresh eggs, there was a study reported a negative association between eggs’ intake and hypertension (HTN), and a preventive trend was also observed with increase intake of eggs [56].",18774eca-d888-4aa0-809f-0d3c3daba9d9
24,methods24," There is also a meta-analysis showed that one egg per day could potentially decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases in Asian populations [57], which consisted with current study that a more moderate intake of fresh eggs was observed in the highest quintile.  When considering daily average nutrients’ intakes, we found that participants in highest quintile tend to have less intakes of total energy, fat, carbohydrate, and sodium, but the remains including those we selected as response variables achieved higher intakes compared with other quintile groups. This indicated that adherence to Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet could lead to a higher nutrient density but lower energy diet, which is also consistent with the principles of Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-diet [42].  The Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet in current study is close to that of other studies. Lee et al.",b7d1cc1d-ea7e-4596-b35f-d633c01fc2bb
25,methods25," conducted dietary patterns analysis based on population-based cohort study in Shanghai, China, which found that among mid-aged or elder male participants, dietary pattern represented by fruit and dairy had negative correlation with both Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), and this effect was more pronounced in those who were heavy alcohol drinkers [58]. Yu et al. conducted a case-control study in Chongqing, China, and found that the pattern, which had higher fish, egg, milk, nut, vegetable, and fruit, but lower salt intake, had strong correlation with lower blood pressure, hypertension (HTN) prevalence, as well as better blood pressure control [59]. A multi-ethnic population-based study in Southwest China showed a greater adherence of grassland pattern (higher consumption of dairy products, soy products, and eggs) was associated with lower risk of hypertension (HTN) [60].",e5d856b0-c2c9-426c-a642-ebf02ebb516e
26,methods26," Moreover, a prospective cohort study showed that the Japanese dietary pattern, which had higher consumption of mushrooms and seaweeds, legumes and products, aquatic products, dairy products, eggs, etc., could decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) mortality; however, a greater adherence of this pattern also showed a higher hypertension (HTN) prevalence and sodium intake [61], which was partly contrary to our findings.  Meanwhile, our research also calculated the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-score to test whether our results had conformity with it. The protective effect was observed in the highest quintile group in full-adjustment model. As for the evaluation of Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-score and well-controlled hypertension (HTN), a protective effect showed in the highest quintile group.",75c61ad8-ecd1-45f7-b371-742387d4fa07
27,methods27," These results indicated that at some point on hypertension (HTN) control and prevention, the Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet has high conformity with Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-diet. There was still some difference of the dietary portrait between them, since Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-diet was established in Western populations and may cannot reflect the dietary characteristics of Chinese well. It consisted with the previous study conducted from China Multi-Ethnic Cohort study, Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score showed an inverse association with hypertension (HTN), but this dietary pattern may not suit for all the Chinese ethnics based on the culture and other lifestyle factors [18]. Thus, it is essential to discuss in further longitudinal research and find out the dietary pattern which are suitable for blood pressure controlling among Chinese population.",2e93f77c-dba2-4d5e-8df0-0dedf92352c5
28,methods28,"  In subgroup analysis, the results showed that protective effect of the Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet on hypertension (HTN) tended to be more pronounced among participants who were male, elderly, and DM patients, and interaction effect modified by DM was also observed. For gender and age difference, previous research showed that premenopausal women had a higher level of cardio-protection than men of similar age, and the former had lower incidence of hypertension (HTN). The mechanism is involved that sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone could regulate the pathway of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor pathways, including Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) and the endothelin system [62] and might have stronger effect than diet. However, after postmenopausal, the prevalence of hypertension (HTN) in women would increase due to lose the protective effect of sex hormones [63,64], which to some extent would increase the role of diet.",fe15a5f4-a069-40a1-a1af-98fb2f3e4a4d
29,methods29," We also observed the interaction effect between Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet score and DM, it might be explained that after being diagnosed with diabetes, patients would autonomously change their diet towards a healthier one which may also further benefit for blood pressure control [65].  Nearly half of Chinese people aged 35–75 years have hypertension (HTN), but the proportion of treatment and control are still deficient. Plus, with the increasing trend of aging, urbanization, and obesity, there is an urgent need to find a more affordable pathway in blood pressure control [6,66]. Since diet is a key determinant in hypertension (HTN) prevention, treatment, and control, it is important to develop a dietary pattern which is suitable for Chinese people. Meanwhile, people nowadays tend to apply non-pharmacological ways including diets on diseases’ modifications to assist or replace medication treatment [67,68].",fcc1659e-4ef0-45ce-a937-4436a6ab1943
30,methods30," Thus, diet intervention may serve as an adjuvant method in the field of hypertension (HTN) and hypertension (HTN)-related diseases prevention and control and has broad prospects in China.  To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study using reduced rank regression (RRR) method to test blood pressure-related dietary patterns and based on a nationwide Chinese sample. Current study had identified a dietary pattern, which is potentially beneficial for hypertension (HTN) prevention and control, multiple adjustment, and subgroup analysis were conducted which could make our results more plausible. However, several limitations should be noticed in our study. Firstly, because of the cross-sectional design, it is hard to draw a confirmed causality between the dietary pattern and hypertension (HTN). Secondly, some other food items may be left out due to the limitation of the 64-item food frequency questionnaire.",5a953793-814f-4179-a1a2-12c7e67c0093
31,methods31," Thirdly, as conducting nationwide research in such a large sample size requires many workforce and material resources, this study might not include all potential variables, especially those laboratory test indexes. Thus, more longitude research and randomized controlled trials are needed in further research.  5. Conclusions  Among all the adults participated in China Nutrition and Health Surveillance (CNHS) 2015–2017, a Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet identified by reduced rank regression (RRR) method has high conformity with Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-diet. The current study showed that greater adherence of Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-diet was a protective factor for the risk of hypertension (HTN). Meanwhile, both could also be beneficial for controlling diagnosed hypertension (HTN).",04574c7b-cfcd-4bd6-b346-7c44bc91856f
32,methods32," The findings indicated that Beneficial for Blood Pressure (BBP)-diet could serve as a potential method for full cycle prevention and treatment of hypertension (HTN), which could also be more suitable for the dietary habits of Chinese population.
