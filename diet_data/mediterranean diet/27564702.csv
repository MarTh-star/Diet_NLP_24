0,methods0,"The present research is a secondary analysis from the Food4Me study [42], which included participants from 7 European countries [43]. The Food4Me study (http://www.food4me.org) was a European on-line randomized controlled intervention study, investigating the utility of a personalised nutrition approach for improving nutritional and diet-related outcomes, which has been described in detail elsewhere [42]. Briefly, the participants who met the inclusion criteria and completed the two-stage online screening, were randomised into the control group, or one of the 3 different intervention levels, which differed in personalization of dietary advice. General healthy eating information was provided to the participants included in the control group, while personalised nutritional advice was provided to the participants included in the 3 personalised nutrition advice groups, feedback was received based only on diet, diet and phenotype, or diet phenotype and genotype.",aa5f54b3-d415-4e8a-9300-898e3e73c827
1,methods1," These dietary recommendations were tailored for each individual, but were not specifically related to the MedDiet.   For the present study, after statistical adjustments between the 4 intervention groups [43], the whole sample was merged together in order to assess the association between MedDiet adherence and changes in specific metabolic traits, and the influence of genetic load on these outcomes, between baseline and 6 months.   From the 1607 participants who were enrolled in the trial [42], 1270 completed the 6-month intervention [44]. All the volunteers who provided complete data on anthropometric measures, and provided adequate samples for biochemical and genetic analyses (n = 1263) were selected to be included in the current analyses (Figure 1).  A validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)) and dietary habits questionnaire [45,46,47] were completed by participants, to self-report usual dietary intake and dietary habits, at baseline and 6 months.",43ed3901-ceb0-4876-886e-dcddb9a3db0d
2,methods2," Adherence to the MedDiet at baseline was calculated and used as an independent variable in all analyses carried out in the present study, except for the quantification of changes in MedDiet adherence and changes in metabolic traits, where data from 6 months were also used. Estimates of daily food intake were used to calculate Mediterranean Diet adherence by employing an adaptation of the PREDIMED fourteen-point score, previously described by Livingstone et al. [48], where the consumption or lack of intake of some foods related to the MedDiet pattern, were assessed. Similarly, self-reported anthropometrical measures were collected following validated procedures [49], at baseline and 6 months.  Blood samples were self-collected at baseline and 6 months by each participant, posted to the relevant recruitment centre and then shipped to a central analytical laboratory.",2a0b8399-c7df-4e99-b0de-a78f9e98c495
3,methods3," Blood determinations were performed through the analysis of finger-prick samples, collected on Dried Blood Spots (Dried Blood Spots (DBS)) cards, which were subsequently analysed by Vitas and DSM (Vitas Ltd., Oslo, Norway; DSM N.V., Heerlen, The Netherlands) for the determination of glucose, total cholesterol, carotenoids and fatty acid markers, as described [50,51]. For the present study, the biochemical measures were used to assess variations in metabolic traits related to obesity [52,53], as well as the assessment of variations in the adherence to the MedDiet [54]. Furthermore, buccal cell samples were collected at baseline by participants using buccal swabs. LGC Genomics (LGC, Teddington, UK) performed DNA isolation and the analyses of the samples by KASPTM genotyping assays (LGC, Teddington, UK), following validated procedures.

4,methods4," The Food4Me project was registered with the Trial Registration number, NCT01530139, at clinicaltrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01530139). Furthermore, the signing of two online consent forms was required for all the candidates interested in participating in the Food4Me study.  A Genetic Risk Score (Genetic Risk Score (GRS)) was computed “a priori” by adding the number of risk alleles presented for selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s [55], which are related to metabolic syndrome traits. A preliminary selection process from the available single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s in the Food4Me project was carried out to prevent spurious associations. The first stage was the determination of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium through a Pearson chi-square test for each single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (Table S1) using the hwsnp command [56]. We found the following single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s: rs6323 for MAOA (p-value < 0.001), rs5082 for APOA2 (p-value = 0.",01d3b8d1-e637-4546-8639-6fad5b01d30c
5,methods6," For the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s within the same gene that were shown to be in high LD, those with the strongest association with relevant traits, based on published evidence (Genome-wide association studies -GWAS- or meta-analysis) were selected, i.e., rs1042714 [58], rs699 [59], rs7412 [60], rs9939609 [61,62,63], rs2282679 [64,65], and rs3764261 [60,66].   Finally, a Quantitative Trait Locus (Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL)) analysis was performed on the remaining 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s, using the qtlsnp command [67], to assess the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s that presented associations with the metabolic traits included in the Food4Me study at baseline (Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference, glucose, total cholesterol, total carotenoids and Omega3 index) ,under a codominant assumption, and adjusted for age, gender, intervention centre, ethnicity, physical activity level, energy intake reported,",5d4314cf-f51c-4284-956f-e91a687b9563

Finally, in order to investigate changes, between baseline and month 6, in anthropometrical and biochemical measurements during the follow-up period, linear mixed models with repeated measurements were performed, also adjusting for confounders. In order to analyse the potential effects of interactions between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), Genetic Risk Score (GRS) and time (baseline–6 months) on the outcome variables, the products of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) × Genetic Risk Score (GRS) × time were included in the linear mixed model.",459d6a4d-cab9-4ad0-9a09-3a9b8a6fae1a

Total cholesterol was the only variable that showed differences depending on Genetic Risk Score (GRS) levels during the follow-up period (low vs. high Genetic Risk Score (GRS): −0.21 ± 0.04 mmol/L vs. −0.09 ± 0.04 mmol/L; p = 0.043).

Moreover, total carotenoids showed significant interactions between Genetic Risk Score (GRS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) for the change from baseline.  Subsequently, differences during the Food4Me intervention between the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) at each level of the Genetic Risk Score (GRS) were assessed (Figure 2). Greater results were detected in those volunteers with a low Genetic Risk Score (GRS) when they presented a higher value in Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) for both anthropometrical measurements (Figure 2a: −0.176 kg/m2 vs. −0.385 kg/m2 with p = 0.048 for Body Mass Index (BMI); and Figure 2b: −0.007 m vs. −0.017 m with p = 0.010 for WC), but no interactions of Genetic Risk Score (GRS) x Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were detected (p for interaction = 0.",6fec53f0-b713-4a38-ab6f-973c82962782

However, the intervention caused slight differences for glucose in individuals with a high Genetic Risk Score (GRS), showing a greater reduction in those participants with a high Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), although no significant differences were observed (Figure 2c: −0.306 mmol/L vs. −0.413 mmol/L with p = 0.061). Regarding cholesterol, a decrease after 6 months was observed (Figure 2d), being greater in those individuals with a lower Genetic Risk Score (GRS), independently of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) level (p-value = 0.042).  Interestingly, concentrations of total circulating carotenoids showed significant differences depending on Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) level only for those volunteers with a high Genetic Risk Score (GRS).",232a9aa3-45ab-46aa-8cc8-ae7435927553
13,methods14," Those individuals with a high Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) exhibited a greater reduction than those with a low Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in carotenoids during the follow-up period (Figure 2e: −0.006 μmol/L vs. −0.163 μmol/L, p = 0.007). No significant differences were detected for the Omega3 index (Figure 2f).  Sensitivity analyses (data not included) were performed, considering separately each single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that was included in the Genetic Risk Score (GRS), to determine which specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s might influence the interaction between Genetic Risk Score (GRS) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with total carotenoids in the blood. Significant differences were found between high and low Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) levels when participants carried both risk alleles for rs6564851 in BCMO1 (−0.140; p = 0.0497), rs1042714 in ADRB2 (−0.224; p = 0.016), and rs2228570 in VDR (−0.231; p = 0.042).",91b93b24-0a45-4ef0-9c40-3742236cdac2

Finally, the associations between variations in Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) at 6 months were analysed, in order to determine overall changes in anthropometrical and biochemical variables as well as differences between subjects with low and high Genetic Risk Score (GRS) (Table 3).

15,methods16," Discussion The present analysis adds value to previous results, associating genetic background disclosure with a higher adherence to MedDiet patterns, in a short-term intervention [68]. The current research evidenced the relevant influence of genetic background, assessed through a Genetic Risk Score (GRS), on obesity and some accompanying metabolic impairments (WC, cholesterol and glucose). Interestingly, this study demonstrated the beneficial effects of greater adherence to the MedDiet on anthropometric and biochemical markers, even in the presence of an elevated genetic risk.  Environmental factors, together with a higher Genetic Risk Score (GRS), have been found to interact with nutritional status [69]. Indeed, the baseline results suggest that an elevated Genetic Risk Score (GRS) is associated with a higher body weight. These data agree with previous studies that found direct associations between genetic risk and body fatness indicators, as well as other related disorders [33,70].",9a70da01-ca3d-4f39-a9af-a4fce5ca15e8
16,methods17," As previously described by Vaxillaire et al. [71], polygenic-based scores for type 2 diabetes are associated with increased concentrations of fasting plasma glucose. Moreover, other authors have suggested that the increase in plasma glucose in individuals with elevated Genetic Risk Score (GRS) and the susceptibility for developing type 2 diabetes could be associated with weight gain [72]. Our study suggests that MedDiet adherence at baseline generated beneficial effects on body weight during the Food4Me intervention, which may be partly associated with the reduction in blood glucose, regardless of Genetic Risk Score (GRS). This outcome agrees with recent results published by Ortega-Azorín et al. [73], who observed that individuals with a greater MedDiet adherence overcame the genetic risk on glucose levels, measured by the aggregated score of the risk alleles present in the FTO and MC4R genes.",5146867f-5f66-4ac6-8b10-a1bc7780ec57
17,methods18," Additionally, the POUNDS LOST [74] and DPP [75] trials reported that individuals with a higher genetic risk for metabolic syndrome manifestations achieved greater benefits from a low-fat diet and an intensive lifestyle intervention based on weight reduction and increment of physical activity, respectively.   These protective effects of the MedDiet on metabolic traits have also been described by other authors [21,76], and the interactions with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s have been tested for several traits, such as diabetes, blood pressure, lipid profiles or cardiovascular disease [13,77]. In this sense, the present study applied a Genetic Risk Score (GRS) with genetically independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s related to several features, such as body weight, adiposity, glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism markers, assuming that multiple loci may jointly contribute to different traits in the presence of epistasis [78].",df81ba38-477a-48fd-b000-22e92afad4b3
18,methods19," Similarly, a recent study tested the interactions between different Genetic Risk Score (GRS) and a healthy diet score in a large cohort of 68,317 individuals of primarily European ancestry, concluding that the associations between genetic predisposition and obesity may be modulated by adherence to a healthy diet [79]. These findings are in accordance with the results obtained in our study, where the beneficial effects of the MedDiet during the intervention were more evident for anthropometrical measurements in those individuals with lower genetic loads. Interestingly, previous studies, focused on specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s in FTO and TCF7L2, have reported a reduction in weight gain for participants who carried risk alleles, when they presented with high adherence to the MedDiet [70,80]. Furthermore, the study from Roswall et al.",3559749f-833a-43a8-96f7-3ed32b2e712d
19,methods20," [70] found an association between risk alleles of FTO and Body Mass Index (BMI), although there were no changes during the follow-up period, which also agrees with the lack of association in anthropometrical changes during the follow-up period of our study.  Regarding biochemical outcomes, differences in Genetic Risk Score (GRS) in our population were related to changes in the levels of total cholesterol, independently of MedDiet adherence. Indeed, all subjects reduced their cholesterol levels during the Food4Me intervention, although those individuals with a higher Genetic Risk Score (GRS) presented a more discreet reduction than those with a low Genetic Risk Score (GRS), independently of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) status. These outcomes may be partly explained by the metabolic dysregulation associated with the genetic background, which makes these individuals more susceptible to these responses, as has been seen in subjects with hypercholesterolemia treated with legumes [81].",4b190fb3-7f6e-40d3-b47e-c8fd57543594
20,methods21," In addition, our data agree with the results reported by Walker et al. [82], where the expected effect of body weight reduction on cholesterol concentration was attenuated by the genetic predisposition score for 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s related to lipid metabolism. Likewise in another study from the same authors, testing genetic predisposition scores, it was shown that higher concentrations of total cholesterol at baseline were associated with genetic predisposition, although no effects were found after an intervention period of 24 weeks with a diet reduced in saturated fatty acids [83].  Nevertheless, results on the influence of genetic load on nutritional status are still under debate [41]. Indeed, a recently published long-term study reported that a low fat diet modified the effects of a specific variant in LIPC on total cholesterol and other serum lipids [84].",dee24576-f394-4d20-b115-a2204976d79e
21,methods22," Another analysis also found an interaction between TCF7L2 and low adherence to the MedDiet, showing higher concentrations of total cholesterol for risk carriers [85]. These findings emphasise the need to design more studies that identify the interactions between macronutrient intake or dietary patterns and genetic make-up, with the main focus on facilitating clear and evidence-based knowledge to practitioners to allow an easier translation to clinical and population settings through personalised nutrition [41]. Moreover, the present results might suggest the presence of interactions between some alleles of various genes with roles in lipid metabolism, leading to a greater impact on phenotypes [86]. Further research on gene–gene interactions may provide better understanding of individual variation in response to different diets [87].",5903dd53-90a0-4dda-b124-f95e78c60772
22,methods23,"  On the other hand, levels of carotenoids and Omega3 index at baseline were higher in volunteers with a higher Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), supporting the increased consumption of fruit, vegetables [88] and oily fish [89] during the trial at baseline. Despite the positive initial association between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and total carotenoid concentration, a global carotenoid reduction and also an interaction of Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and carotenoids after the Food4Me intervention was detected. Dietary carotenoids share absorptive pathways with dietary lipids [90], and concentrations in plasma have been positively associated with cholesterol concentration in blood and adiposity [91,92], which may suggest a parallelism with the results obtained concerning total cholesterol and body weight reduction observed in our study.",089e0911-b0fc-4efa-adc9-c578e226be72
23,methods24," Furthermore, associations between weight reduction and a decrease in carotenoids [93] and lycopene [94] levels have been found after weight loss interventions with caloric restriction for 4 weeks or 12 weeks. These reports help to explain the results observed in our study, which was not specifically designed for weight loss. Furthermore, interactions with effects on carotenoids have been described for BCMO1 [95] and other genes related to lipid metabolism [90]. These results demonstrate that considering the genotype in personalised dietary advice may improve the effect on dietary interventions and may help to achieve an adequate status in nutritional biochemical markers [96]. Similarly, the influences of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) interactions with low responses to plasma β-carotene uptake/conversion, even after administrating specific doses, have been described [97].",66fb3147-765d-46f9-9ba0-50c9a341939e
24,methods25," Interestingly, this research has identified that concentrations of carotenoids follow different trends in low Genetic Risk Score (GRS) compared with individuals presenting with a high Genetic Risk Score (GRS). This interaction should be taken into consideration, because individuals with a high Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) also report lower carotenoid levels, which agree with lower levels in other lipid markers. The interplay between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and genetic make-up, based on risk allele analysis, may contribute to the development of more accurate personalised nutrition advice.   A possible limitation of the present analysis is that individual deviations in dietary intake due to personalised advice, based on specific nutrients, could not be taken into account; thus, further prospective analyses in nutritional interventions designed for specific nutrient consumption may be needed.",a7db2385-08de-4a2c-950d-c51251dd8c23
25,methods26," Another limitation is the incomplete nature of Genetic Risk Score (GRS), since other genetic variants with roles in the response to Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) remain to be described. In addition, it must also be noted that the Food4Me study was not designed as a weight-loss nutritional intervention. Thus, results observed on anthropometric changes should be considered with caution, although it cannot be forgotten that the project was focused on healthy eating guidance. Nevertheless, our study included sensitivity analyses by adjusting for the different intervention levels of advice in the Food4Me study, to evaluate the robustness of the results and no significant differences were found at any level.   5. Conclusions The results of the present study showed that baseline MedDiet adherence is associated with beneficial effects on anthropometrical measurements and might overcome an adverse genetic load.",33cebd7e-c8e2-4708-adef-110a86651ba8
26,methods27," Nevertheless, a higher Genetic Risk Score (GRS) may reduce these benefits on total cholesterol concentration, while the levels of carotenoids in plasma have been shown in the Food4Me population to be affected by the interplay of Genetic Risk Score (GRS) and MedDiet adherence. Indeed, gene × nutrient interactions may contribute to the development of feasible precise nutrigenetic advice, by which the interactions of genetic make-up and the dietary features can be incorporated.
