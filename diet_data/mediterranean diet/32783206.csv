0,background0," Gastrointestinal (gastrointestinal tract (GIT)) microbiota play a role in protecting or promoting adverse pregnancy outcomes. gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbial dysbiosis, as defined as low alpha diversity and reduced levels of butyrate producing bacteria, is associated with bacterial translocation and the promotion of endotoxins, creating systemic inflammation. Such inflammation may lead to preterm labor [1], higher blood pressure [2], and increase the risk of developing gestational diabetes [3]. Thus, improving gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbial health may help to mitigate adverse pregnancy outcomes.  At baseline, a normal gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbial community shifts throughout pregnancy. There is a natural decline in butyrate-producing bacteria from the Firmicutes (Coprococci, Eubacterium, Roseburia, and Faecalibacterium genera) and Bacteroidetes (Odoribacter and Alistipes genera) phyla [2] at the end of gestation.",25e8375d-e807-4e39-8f1e-4d0e13d66618
1,background1," Bifidobacteria, Proteobacteria, and lactic acid–producing bacteria increase during the third trimester. This process is thought to help facilitate the normally observed increase in inflammation and weight gain to increase energy supply for the fetus [4]. The end result is less alpha diversity and Operational Taxonomic Unit (Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU)) richness by the end of the third trimester. Several studies demonstrate that at this point, the composition resembles that of an individual with metabolic syndrome, with increased Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, and decreased Faecalibacterium [4, 5]. The rate at which these changes occur and the degree to which alpha diversity changes may play a role in avoiding preterm birth, preeclampsia, or other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, manipulating microbial diversity over time may be possible with targeting maternal diet.",b3f5463a-31cb-4ac3-9dee-39ba1d2cb4bf
2,background2,"  Several diet patterns have been associated with improved gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbial profiles. Vegetarian diets promote higher levels of roseburia and lacnospiraceae, and reduce collinsella, which is associated with higher levels of circulating insulin [6] [7]. Proportions of high fiber and low-fat intake are correlated with greater microbial diversity and lower levels of bacteriodaceae [8]. Polyunsaturated fatty acids also promote gut mucosal integrity and insulin sensitivity by inhibiting inflammation through byproduct fermentation [9]. Particular interest lies in the Mediterranean diet pattern (Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP)), which is characterized by high amounts of fiber, lean proteins, fruits and vegetables, and lower consumption of red meats and processed foods. Several studies have noted a beneficial association with consumption of an Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiome characteristics.",e9070780-ee0f-49a1-90f3-ce3a0bf38e49
3,background3," Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP) adherence is associated with lower levels of lower Escherichia coli, higher amounts of bifidobacteria, and greater amount of bacterial richness. Such a composition leads to high levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids that contribute to epithelial connections, reduce bacterial translocation and improve systemic inflammation which would otherwise lead to chronic disease [10–13].  Mediterranean diet patterns are also associated with improved maternal and neonatal outcomes including a lower chance of diabetes [14], hypertension during pregnancy [15], excessive gestational weight gain, low birth weight neonates [16], and beneficial metabolic profiling in offspring [17] [18]. The impact of an Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP) has not been thoroughly evaluated on the gastrointestinal microbiome during pregnancy.",d92f23f6-9d37-4c86-8b49-b2b942c3188b
4,background4," The relationship of improved metabolic health with a Mediterranean diet via increased gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbial diversity is established in non-pregnant populations [8] [19], but gaps in knowledge of this relationship among parous women remain. To better understand this relationship, we tested the hypothesis that better adherence to an Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP) is associated with higher microbial diversity during pregnancy.

Differences were detected among aggregate abundance at the family level among ethnicities. We observed greater abundance of lactobacillaceae in Japanese and Filipino compared to Non-Hispanic White and Native Hawaiian participants (p = 0.018). Non-Hispanic White women tended to have higher Porphyromonadaceae (NS). Native Hawaiians had higher levels of Acidaminococcaceae (NS) (Fig.",b0b4bee6-992b-457b-8b1f-a9b049d1b5ff

There is a shift in the types and abundance of microbes present between the first and second trimesters to the third trimester. Consistent with other observations [4], alpha diversity decreased significantly over time from first to third trimester. The rate of change was not different between those who scored above and below the mean aMED Score (Fig. 4).

17,results7," aMED Scores above the mean are represented by circles and scores below the mean are represented by triangles  The primary test for a relationship between alpha diversity metrics and aMED Score was evaluated as a linear correlation, with the hypothesis that better adherence to the Mediterranean diet would increase alpha diversity. While bivariate analysis of those above and below the mean did not show a rate of change over time (Fig. 4), there was linear correlation with aMED score and alpha diversity of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiome. Table 3 shows the correlation coefficient for all diversity metrics with combined aMED scores, irrespective of trimester. The correlation is primarily supported by the association in the third trimester with regards to overall richness, as measured by Chao1 Index and Observed species number (Fig. 6). Specifically, this comparison is visualized in a scatterplot, with aMED score on the X axis, and alpha diversity measures on the Y-axis (Fig.",6c540640-c9c5-4f01-9920-c3d651517395

To determine the relationship between observed species number and aMED score, multivariate linear mixed-effect model was implemented using lme4 package in R. Fixed effect covariates included obesity, parity, ethnicity, trimester and age, while subject was treated as random effects. Visual inspection of residual plots did not reveal any obvious deviations from homoscedasticity or normality. No significant correlation or covariate was produced from the model, except for aMED score (B-estimate 4.83, 95% Confidence Interval 1.5–8.14).

There is a greater abundance of Acidaminoaceae in the those that scored the highest compared to than those with the lowest aMED scores. (p = 0.0169). Interestingly, there is also a trend for higher diet quality being associated with increased Prevotellaceae.

25,discussion0," The relationship of improved metabolic health with a Mediterranean diet via increased gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbial diversity during pregnancy is not well understood, in particular among ethnically diverse women. To our knowledge, this study is the first to characterize dietary patterns and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiome in a multi-ethnic cohort in the Pacific, and examine this relationship at the microbial species level. The unique makeup of Hawai’i residents is infrequently represented in dietary research of pregnant women [29–31]. The population consists of immigrants, first generation individuals, and a large heterogenous group of mixing cultures. As such, dietary patterns are influenced from a variety of sources. There is also a unique consumption of diverse fermented foods such as nato and poi that may contribute to a distinct gut microbiota.",72297779-e656-47d6-a146-370349e42038
26,discussion1,"  Our cohort followed the widely described transition to decreased diversity under the influence of hormonal shifts across gestation. Commensurate with other published studies of pregnant populations [32] [4], there were significant differences in Shannon, Chao1, Simpson, and observed number of species from first trimester to third trimester. The changes were mostly represented in a decrease in total abundance of lactobacillaceae (p = 0.013), and lachnospiracheae (p = 0.00489), and an increase in prevotellaceae (p = 0.03). On top of this pregnancy shift, Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP) adherence influenced microbial diversity over time, even while accounting for body mass index (BMI), ethnicity and parity. While other studies have demonstrated that diet has more of an influence on microbial composition than body mass index, this was masked in our study by the pregnant cohort [33].",9092b317-943a-4510-9348-72fb8221973e
27,discussion2," Our primary outcome, a linear correlation with diet quality as measured by adherence to Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP) and microbial diversity was demonstrated; Women with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP) had a smaller decrease in alpha diversity in the third trimester. The benefits of adherence to an Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP) is well documented both on development of chronic disease, and likely mechanisms by which these occur – namely inflammation, and aberrant gut microbiota. These relationships have not been specifically explored during pregnancy. Our results offer novel insight into the impact that diet had on microbial composition and richness over pregnancy. Specifically, despite a normal transition to more dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) during the third trimester, this shift was mitigated by better adherence to Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP).",d4d31f46-79ea-4e10-8725-4d055a4dc735
28,discussion3,"  One other recent study describes the impact of dietary quality on gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbial health during pregnancy. Laitinen et al. measured diet quality by the “Index of Diet Quality” (IDQ) score and alpha diversity in early pregnancy (one time point at less than 18 weeks gestation) [34]. Researchers detected a correlation of diet quality and all indices (Shannon Index, Chao, observed Species number and phylogenetic diversity) within this cohort of overweight and obese women in Finland. They noted the two food components most associated with increased alpha diversity were whole grains and vegetables, similar to our findings. Both our study and Laitinen’s demonstrate that comprehensive diet quality is beneficial for maternal gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbial health.",5623626f-2c60-4f11-a790-39fb5e118466
29,discussion4," While other research has focused on particular micro or macronutrients [8, 35] impact on gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiome, we sought to understand how holistic and balanced nutrition improves the gut microbiome, as this type of dietary pattern is the easiest to which to adhere.  At the species level, several species were noted to be more abundant in those with the highest aMED scores (> 6). While the literature is limited in descriptions of how these organisms directly impact human health, some of the identified species have been described in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions [27, 36, 37]. Several of the species more abundant in participants with higher aMED scores are described as producing beneficial by products such a butyrate and acetic acid (As described in Table 4) [23]. For instance, there was greater abundance of lactobacillus rogosae and alisteps sp. in women with higher aMED Scores in our cohort.",08832a2f-e6a3-4460-b83c-05be387573ba
30,discussion5," These organisms are observed to be decreased in women with gestational diabetes or glucose intolerance during pregnancy [28, 38]. Coprococcus and A. tetradius are also known to produce butyrate and acetic acid, supporting tight mucosal adhesion within the gastrointestinal tract and thus decreasing systemic inflammation [26, 39]. Likewise, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is associated with decreased cytokine production in patients with Crohn’s disease [25, 40].  Looking at the specific enterotypes represented in this cohort, Prevotella was highly abundant in participants with higher diet quality scores [34]. Within the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiome, a Prevotella-dominant enterotype is associated with high intake of fiber, carbohydrate, and simple sugars, whereas Bacteroides-dominant enterotype is associated with the high intake of animal fat and protein [24]. De Fillipo et al. and Martinez et al.",d384ef99-4ce5-49c1-a887-d0384affa60e
31,discussion6," both describe a Prevotella dominant enterotype is prevalent in populations eating a more traditional diet versus Westernized dietary pattern [41] [42]. As such, this composition led to overall greater microbial richness, and produced higher levels of short-chain fatty acids. In our cohort, Native Hawaiians had the highest abundance of Prevotellaceae, and also had higher adherence to Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP). Yet, this population also has some of the highest adverse pregnancy outcomes in Hawai’i [43, 44]. Further investigation of these relationships is needed to understand what contribution nutrition plays into ethnic-specific disparate birth outcomes.  Mechanistic knowledge is still needed before the connection to translatable, modifiable health interventions utilizing the microbiome is achieved. This study aimed to provide more baseline knowledge about nutrition and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiome in pregnancy with the aim to generate new areas of investigation.",d7bc9de0-5fec-4699-a4f2-9fa7bfbd5756
32,discussion7," The majority of research on the microbiome in pregnancy thus far has been directed toward characterizing vaginal microbial communities, with an emphasis on the association with preterm birth. Many studies demonstrate that increased vaginal microbial diversity and depletion lactobacillus-dominant communities are associated with preterm birth [45–47]. Researchers hypothesize this is due to acquisition of pathogenic organisms, or from metabolites produced by anerobic microbes [48]. Conversely, little is yet known regarding the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiome in pregnancy. The specific families, species or communities that are most important have yet to be characterized, and interventions such as probiotics to affect pregnancy health have thus far proven futile [49].",0c092cbe-325a-4f2b-aa63-ca581cf4b0ca
33,discussion8," Furthermore, the vaginal and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiome are closely related, and additional studies are needed to demonstrate how both the vaginal and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbial communities, which are interconnected, contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as interventions that can be utilized to impact health outcomes.  Limitations of this study include inherent recall bias by using a Food Frequency Questionnaire. However, FFQs are often structured to have patients recall what they eat over a predetermined time period. FFQs have been shown to be as accurate as 24-h recall in correlation with biologic specimens showing metabolites and nutrients [50]. Another limitation is our limited sample size. The authors acknowledge the limitation in the observational nature of this small study as hypothesis-generating. The cohort was not powered to measure the ultimate impact of microbial diversity of adverse pregnancy outcomes.",3dd4e545-a2d1-4701-885b-18d1ced2d423
34,discussion9," While an attempt was made to account for other confounding factors that influence microbial health, some aspects were not captured such as exercise, maternal adiposity, or domestic environment (rural versus urban). However, this study lays the groundwork for future research for understanding the contributions of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbial dysbiosis, nutrition and prevention of adverse perinatal outcomes, and biologic mechanisms by which this occurs. The strengths of this study include it being the first-time diet quality and microbial composition has been described in pregnant women in Hawai’i. Measuring these relationships and changes longitudinally across all three trimesters makes this insightful information even more impactful.  Conclusions  Ultimately, microbial diversity is comprised of several environmental factors including adiposity, environment, geography and diet.",35833c05-d780-418a-b212-922c7d782fc0
35,discussion10," The strongest determinant observed in our cohort was pregnancy itself, with the hormonal changes leading to an expected decrease in diversity over time. While to a lesser degree, adherence to Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP) was also impactful on alpha diversity within the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and should be considered when discussing nutrition recommendations with pregnant women.  Supplementary Information  Additional file 1: Table S1. Mean values [with (Standard Deviation) below] of alpha diversity and aMED scores were compared among those who did and did not develop the most common pregnancy complications in the cohort. Pregnancy outcome and microbiome data was available for 36 participants.  Additional file 2: Fig. S1. Aggregate distribution of all reported energy adjusted aMED scores.  Additional file 3: Fig. S2.Prevotella:Bacteroides Ratios among those above (right panel) and below (left panel) the median aMED score.",8a5c3013-b162-4825-90e1-0735a01350fb
