0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Characteristics of the Sample  The study included twelve patients (6 Males and 6 Females) with an age range between 45 and 65, recruited among the outpatients attending the Obesity Unit of the AOU of Cagliari (Italy) and the Diabetology Unit of the PO Binaghi (ASSL of Cagliari, Italy) after a new diagnosis of T2DM, from March to May 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic, and especially the lockdown period, limited the recruitment of patients; thus, the total number was slightly lower than that provided in the original design of this study. The data were collected at baseline (T0) and after two (T2) and three months (T3).  The study was approved by the Local Ethical Committee of the AOU of Cagliari (Prot. N. PG/2020/9435) and carried out according to the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans.",956cdaf6-f965-41a7-88d7-5fda46c8dd31
1,methods1," The selected patients were clearly and comprehensively informed about the purpose and the design of the study, and they signed an informed consent to join the research.  The Inclusion criteria were the presence of a newly diagnosed and not complicated T2DM (according to IDF/American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria) [2,3], a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value of 6.5–8.9%, a Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) ≥28 Kg/m2, and the condition of drug-naïve patients for T2DM.  The exclusion criteria were the presence of T1DM, serious heart diseases, severe and/or uncontrolled hypertension, severe or uncompensated kidney, liver, or thyroid diseases, painful pathologies with severe functional limitations, tumors in chemo/radiotherapy, severe psychopathology, gastrointestinal diseases, therapy with corticosteroids, proton pump inhibitors, antimicrobials, prebiotic or probiotic intake,",f6b72c46-c32b-4785-9608-5d339eb6b4bc
2,methods2," and any dietary supplements or participation to other dietary regimes in the three months preceding the sample collection.  After the enrollment, at baseline (T0), the selected patients underwent a multidimensional evaluation including clinical, metabolic, anthropometric, lifestyle, and quality of life assessment. At the same time, the analysis of GM was performed.  Patients were then randomly assigned to the specific nutritional intervention (NI): 6 patients (3M, 3F) were assigned to a low-calorie MD according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines (MD (MEDI) group) [46] and 6 patients (3M, 3F) to a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) diet (KETO group) [76].  During the first month of NI, one female patient of the MD (MEDI) group was excluded because of COVID-19 infection; thus, the sample study included eleven patients (6M, 5F): 6 (3M, 3F) in the KETO group and 5 (3M, 3F) in the MD (MEDI) group.",f0c0adb6-d510-434d-b42c-9c103ce94c27
3,methods3,"  All patients underwent the same scientific procedural rigor, and the same conditions (operators, environment, breaks/holidays, etc.) were guaranteed in the two groups to limit the influence of independent variables and to consolidate the reliability of the results.  The same evaluation performed at T0 was carried out three months after the baseline assessment (T3) for the comparison of results. After the first and second month of NI (T1, T2), a short anthropometric and clinical (glycometabolic status) evaluation and a brief interview aimed at ascertaining the adherence to the nutritional program was performed to analyze any critical issues or strengthen motivation, particularly, in KETO patients the T1 and T2 aimed at monitoring the state of ketosis, and modulating their nutritional treatment structured on well-defined phases, as described in the paragraph “Dietary protocols.",9d4d4bf6-d109-4a49-8270-ad761a2b5e09
4,methods4,"” Moreover, at T2 (end of the ketosis phases in the KETO group), the GM analysis was repeated in both study groups.  2.2. Clinical, Metabolic, Anthropometric, Lifestyle, and Health Status Evaluation  The clinical examination, performed by the endocrinologist, included the collection of a full medical history, detailed information on drug use, physical examination, standardized Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart Rate (HR) measurement, as well as the quality of life assessment.  The metabolic assessment consisted of a 12 h fasting blood sample for determination with standard methods of fasting plasma glycemia (fasting plasma glycemia (FPG)), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C peptide, total cholesterol, HDL (LDL calculated by Friedwald’s formula), total triglycerides, creatininemia, aspartate aminotransferase (aminotransferase (AST)), alanine aminotransferase (aminotransferase (ALT)), uricemia, blood count, protein electrophoresis, sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+),",e29e1b46-a519-4a82-851c-796e68d0746f
5,methods5," thyroid stimulating hormone (thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)), urine test, microalbuminuria determinations.  The anthropometric measurements were taken by the same expert nutritionist according to current standards [84]. Weight expressed in kilograms (kg) was measured with an impedance scale (Model tanshinone IIA (TAN)ITA BC420 MA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) while patients were in a fasting state, wearing only light clothes. Height, expressed in centimeters (cm), was measured by a stadiometer (SECA, Hamburg, Germany) on barefoot patients with heels together and the body kept in an upright position. The reading was approximated to the nearest cm.  The Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index (BMI)) was calculated according to the weight (kg) to height squared ratio (kg/m2). The waist circumference (WC), expressed in cm, was measured according to the NHANES III protocol [84].",0cd9a786-c32d-443c-a1ad-5434efbc8d39
6,methods6,"  The analysis of body composition (body composition (BIA)) at T0 and T3 was carried out by the bioelectrical impedance analyzer (Mascaretti, Ancona, Italy). The exam was performed as suggested by the European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN)) [85]. The data obtained corresponds with the resistance and reactance, which inserted in the software indicated fat mass (FM%), fat-free mass (FFM kg), and phase angle (phA°).  The intermediate anthropometric evaluation (T1, T2) consisted exclusively of the weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), and WC measurements.  The lifestyle evaluation, carried out by the nutritionist during an individual interview, included the nutritional and physical activity level assessment.",2667ac65-de60-437b-be97-e886407609e4
7,methods7,"  The nutritional assessment consisted of the administration of a standardized and validated questionnaire aimed at establishing the degree of adherence to the MD through a score (Mediterranean Diet Score, MDS, range 0–55) [86] and a detailed report in the form of a food diary in the three days of the weekend preceding the visit, analyzed using the Winfood® software (Medimatica, Colonnella, Italy). More specifically, the description of the Mediterranean Diet Score, and food diary analysis, can be found as Supplementary Materials in the section “Nutritional evaluation”.  The administration of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)), used in its short version, allowed the ascertainment of the level of physical activity (physical activity (PAL)) and the degree of sedentariness.",64948ccf-7b2f-4fbf-8873-388b57e1387a
8,methods8," The physical activity (PAL) was calculated according to the estimated energy expenditure derived from the reported physical activity (vigorous, moderate, and walking) and expressed in Metabolic Equivalent of Task-minutes per week (METs/w), while the sedentary behavior was estimated by assessing the average daily sitting time (h/day) [87].  The assessment of the Quality of Life and perceived health status was performed through the administration of the standardized questionnaire SF-36, which consists of a series of questions aimed at investigating eight aspects of physical and mental health; results expressed as a score ranging between 0 and 100, can be reported as two summary scores: the physical component summary (physical component summary (PCS)) score and the mental component summary (mental component summary (MCS)) score [88].  2.3.",1be19567-15e1-477d-88f7-a82c1709e950
9,methods9," Dietary Protocols  The two study groups (KETO and MD (MEDI)) underwent, respectively, a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and a low-calorie MD protocol.  The MD (MEDI) group followed a traditional Mediterranean diet characterized by a macronutrient intake with a predilection for carbohydrate sources from wholegrain products and moderate consumption of proteins and fats [48]. The daily caloric intake was moderately low and was calculated on the estimated requirement, based on anthropometric measures, with a medium daily calorie deficit of 300–500 kcal, not less than the Resting Metabolic Rate (Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)).  The diet was structured with multiple isocaloric choices in the same food group, including protein, glycidic, and lipid sources in the three main meals and at least five daily servings of fruit and vegetables.",2615bfde-78dd-4d9d-90a1-7a4f48adac53
10,methods10,"  As regards the frequency of food consumption, no precise indications have been provided; however, it was advisable to vary the food choices, favoring fish, legumes, white meat, and extra-virgin olive oil as seasoning, typical of the Mediterranean style, and reduce the intake of red meat, full-fat dairy products, and refined foods. However, such products could be consumed as an exception to the diet.  The KETO group followed a multiphasic protocol, with exclusive initial use of protein meal replacement products (Therascience, Monaco, Principality of Monaco) and at least two daily servings of non-starchy vegetables. In addition, according to guidelines, omega-3, multivitamins, and multimineral supplementation were prescribed [76]. Each meal replacement product consisted of approximately 18 g of high-value proteins per serving; therefore, the number of products used daily was proportional to the protein requirement indicated by guidelines as 1.2–1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight [76].",dede3ae2-1c78-412b-9001-701c29ccdb5d
11,methods11," This first phase (phase 1) lasted 30 days, while during the second and third phases, both lasting 15 days (phases 2 and 3), the first one and then two meals with natural protein foods (meat, fish, eggs) were inserted. After sixty days of ketosis, carbohydrates were gradually added, starting with fruit (phase 4); subsequently, every week (phases 5, 6, 7), a different food category containing carbohydrates (dairy products, legumes, cereals) was reintroduced, leading to a low-calorie Mediterranean diet, as that of MD (MEDI) group, in three months. The maintenance of the state of ketosis was ascertained by measuring blood levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (by measuring blood levels of β hydroxybutyrate (BOHB)) through a finger-prick test and a handheld β-ketone analyzer (Menarini Areo, Florence, Italy). The test was performed before starting KD (T0) and during the sixty days of ketosis, specifically at T1 and T2.  2.4. Gut Microbiota Analysis  2.4.1.",e4ec6b76-ee5e-4a91-8470-031104ed413d
12,methods12," Sample Collection  Stool samples from each subject were independently collected and transported to the laboratory within 3 h. Fresh samples were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until further processing.  2.4.2. Genomic DNA Extraction, Bacterial DNA Quantification, and 16S Libraries Preparation and Sequencing  Genomic DNA extraction from stool samples and quantification of bacterial DNA was performed as previously described [89]. The protocol of library preparation has been described in detail elsewhere [32]. 16S barcoded amplicon libraries were generated using primers targeting the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, and the Nextera XT index kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), and their size and quality were verified using D1000 reagents kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) on the Tapestation 4200 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).",6484bbdf-7228-49ca-9d9a-16a05e7b11b0
13,methods13," Amplicon libraries were quantified on the DeNovix QFX fluorometer by using the DeNovix dsDNA HS Assay Kit, normalized to a concentration equal to 4 nM, then pooled. Pooled libraries and the adapter-ligated library PhiX v3 used as a control were denatured and diluted to equal concentration (6 pM) and subsequently combined to obtain a PhiX concentration equal to 20% of the total volume. Combined 16S library and PhiX control were further denatured and sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) on a v3 paired-end run (300 × 2 cycles) using MiSeq v3 Reagent Kit (Illumina).  2.5. Bioinformatic and Statistical Analysis  Anthropometric, metabolic, lifestyle, and health status data, which represent continuous variables, are reported as Mean Value ± Standard Deviation (M ± SD).",a7a1ff8f-3b16-49f6-afb2-df7e92b0e03a
14,methods14," The comparison of data before and after NI in each group was performed using a t-test for paired data, while a t-test for independent samples was performed to compare the mean difference (T0-T3) of the same variables between the two groups; a p-value (p) < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  As regards GM data, reads were processed using QIIME 2 [90]. First, primers were removed using cutadapt [91] (q2-cutadapt QIIME 2 plugin). Using DAmerican Diabetes Association (ADA)2 [92] (q2-dada2 QIIME 2 plugin), reads were truncated at 3′ ends and filtered by quality. High-quality reads were denoised and merged to produce amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Chimeric ASVs were filtered using VSEARCH [93] (q2-vsearch QIIME 2 plugin) and the SILVA database (v138) [94] as reference.",25ad57db-9e21-4a82-a70a-de5880d349a3
15,methods15," Taxonomic assignment of ASVs was performed using a Naive-Bayes taxonomic classifier [95] (q2-feature-classifier QIIME 2 plugin) trained in a custom version of the SILVA database generated using RESCRIPt [96] (q2-rescript QIIME 2 plugin). Finally, non-bacterial ASVs (e.g., mitochondrial) were removed. The final taxonomic profiles were used as the input of PICRUSt2 [97] (q2-picrust2 QIIME 2 plugin) to infer functional potential profiles from taxonomic data.  All microbiome analyses (plotting and statistics) were performed in R, and all plots were built with the R package ggplot2 [98].  To account for different sequencing depths, samples were normalized to 22,173 reads (the lowest number of reads per sample) by Scaling with Ranked Subsampling (Scaling with Ranked Subsampling (SRS)) [99] using the Scaling with Ranked Subsampling (SRS) R package [100].",ba6587dd-880e-4915-9462-fb5b570126b8
16,methods16,"  Alpha-diversity was assessed considering the ASV richness (observed ASVs) and the Shannon index, calculated with the R package phyloseq [101], and the Pielou’s J index, calculated with the R package microbiome, as alpha-diversity metrics. Alpha diversity differences between the two nutritional groups at each time point were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U test; alpha diversity differences across time points within each nutritional group were assessed using the Wilcoxon paired test.  Beta-diversity based on the Bray–Curtis distance matrix (calculated with the R package phyloseq), unweighted and weighted UniFrac metrics (calculated with the R package rbiom [102]) was compared between the two different nutritional groups at each time point and between each time point within the same nutritional intervention group using PCoAs and the PERMANOVA test.",1f590314-a842-42a1-a392-880f22081442
17,methods17,"  The Generalized Linear Mixed-effects Model implemented in MaAsLin2 [103] was used to find significant longitudinal changes in bacterial taxa abundances (from phylum down to species level) during each diet. The patient was considered a random effect. The statistical significance was tested considering p ≤ 0.05, with a Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) correction cut-off at q ≤ 0.25.  3. Results  3.1. Anthropometric, Metabolic, Lifestyle, and Health Status Evaluation  Table 1 reports the anthropometric, metabolic, lifestyle, and health status data of the KETO and MD (MEDI) groups at baseline, which did not differ significantly from each other.  Table 2 and Table 3 show the anthropometric, metabolic, lifestyle, and health status data of KETO and MD (MEDI) groups before and after three months of NI. Both diets improved the anthropometric and metabolic status, mostly in the KETO group, which showed more significant results (Table 2).",23433834-e5a1-42fd-8fde-e1af6d8e87e7
18,methods18," Patients following the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) have achieved significant major progress in total weight reduction (−14.3 vs. −3.04 kg; p < 0.0001), Body Mass Index (BMI) (−5.3 vs. −1.1 kg/m2; p < 0.0001), WC (−12.9 vs. −4.7 cm; p = 0.0006), and FM% (−7 vs. −3.1; p = 0.03) reduction, compared to MD (MEDI) group, while differences in FFM kg (−2.8 vs. +0.3; p = 0.053), fasting plasma glycemia (FPG) levels (−24.8 vs. +6.8 mg/dL; p = 0.08), HbA1c values (−1.15 vs. −0.7%; p = 0.45), lipid status, and BP values were not significant (Table 3). Moreover, a slight reduction and an increase, albeit not significant, of the phA were observed in the KETO and MD (MEDI) groups at T3, respectively; nonetheless, when the phA T0-T3 variation between the two groups was compared, a significant result was found (−0.2 vs. +0.3; p = 0.004).",095115ac-66fd-4d38-a49d-9a2cb42cc91c
19,methods19,"  Regarding the nutritional evaluation, both groups reduced the daily caloric intake and improved the adherence to MD, although that change did not reach a statistical significance; in addition, at T3, the KETO group significantly increased protein intake (19.7 ± 2.1% vs. 26.7 ± 2.6%; p = 0.004) and MDS scores relative to fish (1.7 ± 0.8 vs. 2.8 ± 0.7; p= 0.01) and vegetables (3.3 ± 1.5 vs. 5 ± 0; p = 0.04) intake. The detailed nutritional analysis results of both groups are reported in Supplementary Table S1 online.  The physical activity level and the daily sitting time remained unchanged in both groups. The SF-36 analysis showed a significant improvement of both physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) indicators, exclusively in the KETO group, while in the MD (MEDI) group, a slight decrease in both scores was observed (Table 2). Moreover, the SF-36 T0-T3 comparison between the two groups showed a significant result (Table 3).",365c8f2d-ad19-4c2b-a193-9c94dc7510fa
20,methods20,"  Finally, the brief evaluation performed at T2, corresponding to the end of the ketosis phase of the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) protocol, highlighted a significant reduction of body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), and WC compared to baseline in the KETO group (p < 0.0001) and a significant reduction of WC (p = 0.004), but not of body weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) in the MD (MEDI) group. Regarding these anthropometric variables, we also compared the results obtained at T2 and T3, observing a further significant reduction of body weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) (p = 0.007), but not of WC in the KETO group, and a slightly significant reduction of Body Mass Index (BMI) (p = 0.04) in the MD (MEDI) group.",1402b15b-b04c-4099-bb3f-90cf5e830a7c
21,methods21,"  As for the metabolic evaluation, the results of the auto-monitoring revealed an improvement of fasting plasma glycemia (FPG) exclusively in the KETO group, which at this time point showed evidence of the state of ketosis through the finger-prick test; moreover, one patient of this group reported the reduction of the anti-hypertensive therapy.  3.2. Gut Microbiota Analysis  First, the sequencing depth for each sample was assessed by calculating the Good’s coverage, which showed an excellent coverage (>99.993% for all samples). It has also been confirmed that all the microbiota diversity was sampled by drawing rarefaction curves, which showed that adequate sequencing depth was achieved (see Figure 1).  3.2.1. Alpha and Beta Diversity Analysis  To account for different sequencing depths, samples were normalized to 22,173 reads (the lowest number of reads per sample).",8e8db5bc-206e-402c-9192-c0f63aa82a2f
22,methods22,"  The Mann–Whitney U test showed no statistically significant differences in the ASV richness and in the Shannon index across the two nutritional groups over time, while the Pielou’s J index, at baseline, was significantly higher in KETO, compared to MD (MEDI) (p = 0.017, see Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S2 online).  Moreover, no statistically significant differences in all alpha diversity indices throughout the duration of each nutritional intervention were observed, which was assessed by performing a Wilcoxon paired test between different time points (see Figure 3 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 online).  Concerning the beta diversity, the compositional trajectory of each patient along the nutritional intervention is shown in Figure 4.",0ceea61a-3533-47b3-ae84-d728d5e002d1
23,methods23,"  The Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix showed a marked separation between the GM communities of KETO and MD (MEDI) at baseline (see Figure 5 and Supplementary Table S5 online), confirmed by PERMANOVA analysis, which indicated a significant difference in beta diversity between cohorts (sum of squares = 0.599, mean of squares = 0.599, F = 1.727, R2 = 0.161, p = 0.013). However, the beta diversity based on the unweighted and weighted UniFrac metrics across the two nutritional groups did not show any statistically significant difference over time, as shown in Figure 5 and in Supplementary Table S5 online.  Similarly, no statistically significant differences in beta diversity throughout each nutritional intervention were obtained by performing a pairwise analysis between each time point (see Figure 6 and Supplementary Tables S6 and S7 online).  3.2.2.",3929fe1e-23c8-4386-8f4d-5d1481c0ea10
24,methods24," Compositional Analysis of Intestinal Microbiota  Although some volunteers presented huge variations in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio during the nutritional intervention, no statistically significant differences were detected between timepoints in both diet groups (see Figure 7 and Supplementary Tables S8 and S9 online).  The Generalized Linear Mixed-effects Model, confirmed after multiple testing corrections, with a cut-off at q ≤ 0.25, showed several significant microbial markers associated with the nutritional intervention, almost exclusively with the ketogenic one (see Figure 8). Specifically, we performed a pairwise analysis between each GM community time point within the specific study group.",1a36652c-fb6e-406a-abac-f5944801df9e
25,methods25,"  As regards the KETO group, results showed that after two months of dietary protocol, twenty-one bacterial taxa significantly increased, while thirteen were significantly reduced; after three months of NI, twenty-two microbial taxa were significantly elevated, and ten were significantly depleted. Moreover, the comparison between GM communities at T2 and T3 time points showed that three taxa were enriched in T3 and five taxa were enriched in T2 (see Figure 8 and Table 4). Results were ranked by their MaAsLin2 coefficient: the Verrucomicrobiota phylum was identified as the main biomarker in KETO, together with its members Verrucomicrobiae, Verrucomicrobiales, Akkermansiaceae, and Akkermansia, both at T2 and T3 of nutritional intervention; while within the Firmicutes phylum the strongest associations were related to Christensenellales order and Christensenellaceae family in the same time points.",110414e8-6729-468d-a704-3c88b1c3ff85
26,methods26," At the same time, the Actinobacteroidota phylum was significantly depleted both at T2 and T3; while, within the Firmicutes phylum, genera belonging to Lachnospiraceae family (Agathobacter, Anaerostipes, Fusicatenibacter, and Dorea), to Ruminococcaceae family (Subdoligranulum) were significantly depleted as a consequence of two months of NI in KETO and the Barnesiella and Butyricimonas genera (belonging to Bacteroidota phylum and Bacteroidales order), the Lachnoclostridium and X Ruminococcus torques group genera (belonging to Firmicutes phylum and Lachnospiraceae family) were significantly reduced after three months of NI in the same patients compared with baseline.",68d9036e-391d-4c5d-91e2-9a772fd61ad6
27,methods27," Furthermore, the UCG 010 family and its unclassified members at the genus and species level showed a strong association in KETO as a consequence of the NI from T2 to T3; by contrast, the genus Lachnoclostridium and a Lachnoclostridium unclassified species (belonging to Firmicutes phylum), the Tannerellaceae family and its members Parabacteroides and Parabacteroides distasonis (Bacteroidota phylum) were significantly associated at T2 compared with T3 (see Figure 8 and Table 4).  As regards the MD (MEDI) group, we observed that no taxa varied significantly after two months of the dietary protocol. The Actinobacteroidota phylum was identified as the only taxon that increased after three months of NI compared to baseline; while, by comparing the GM communities of T2 and T3 time points, in addition to Actinobacteroidota, also strong associations were related to Firmicutes phylum at T3.",58ddb0d0-0164-4b03-9a4a-e082f9718d0b
28,methods28," The Desulfobacterota phylum and a species belonging to the genus Bacteroides were significantly associated with T2 time points compared to T3 in the same patients (see Figure 8 and Table 5).  Abundance changes between time points can be further contemplated by representing the relative abundance fluctuations along the nutritional intervention (see Figure 9). Because most MaAsLin2 associations for KETO occur at the genus level and most MaAsLin2 associations for MD (MEDI) occur at the phylum level, Figure 9 depicts significantly enriched or depleted taxa at the genus and phylum levels for KETO and MD (MEDI), respectively.  3.2.3. Functional Metagenome Prediction Analysis  Comparative prediction analysis of the functional metagenome was performed using PICRUSt2. A total of seventy significant metabolic pathways were identified in KETO over time (see Figure 10 and Supplementary Table S10 online).",90b6be19-0170-4e54-a2b4-bb6146caa16f
29,methods29," In particular, the common twenty-two pathways were significantly increased both at T2 and T3 compared with baseline, while the common seventeen pathways were significantly reduced at the same time points. Of the remaining thirty-one pathways, eleven and six were significantly increased and reduced, respectively, after two months of NI and, similarly, after three months, although with small effect size; seven and six were significantly increased and reduced, respectively, after three months of NI and, at the same time, after two months, although with small effect-size. In addition, only one pathway (phenylalanine metabolism) significantly decreased at T3 compared with T2, consistently with a reduction at T2 and T3 compared with baseline, although with a small effect size.",df49098b-036a-435b-995c-0b21de508007
30,methods30,"  In KETO, the strongest associations were positively related to steroid biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, and non-homologous end-joining pathways both at T2 and T3 compared with baseline, while penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis, limonene, and pinene degradation and ethylbenzene degradation pathways were strongly and negatively associated with the same time points. Moreover, among other strongly associated pathways, xylene degradation was significantly and negatively associated at T2, while at T3, it was reduced, although with a small effect size; carbohydrate digestion and absorption were the most strongly and negatively associated pathway with T3 compared with baseline, while at T2 it was reduced, although with small effect-size. No pathway was significantly associated with MD (MEDI) over time.  4.",0b108b1c-fc42-49bc-9f1e-784ac944a00c
31,methods31," Discussion  This study evaluated the short-term impact of two dietary models (very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and MD) on the GM and its functional profile of eleven patients with overweight or obesity, recently diagnosed with T2DM; among them, six subjects followed the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) (KETO group) [76], while five subjects followed the low-calorie MD (MD (MEDI) group) [46]. At baseline and after 3 months of NI, all patients underwent a multidimensional evaluation including anthropometric, clinical, metabolic, lifestyle, and quality of life assessment, while the GM evaluation was also performed after 2 months of NI along with a brief anthropometric assessment.  Lifestyle interventions are an essential element in the treatment of patients with T2DM, overweight or obesity, and metabolic alterations, especially in the initial phase of T2DM, with the aim of losing weight, reducing visceral fat, and managing the disease without drugs [39,104].",9bfa9821-f983-467f-9dd4-04a5475ccf35
32,methods32," Nonetheless, it remains to be ascertained which type of physical activity to be practiced, the best dietary protocol to be followed, and whether the improvement in the metabolic profile is to be attributed to weight loss, regardless of the proposed dietary approach.  Several randomized clinical trials have shown that an increase in physical activity associated with proper nutritional education allows a significant reduction in body weight and an improvement in blood pressure, lipid profile, and glycemic control in elderly patients with T2DM [105,106], supporting the key role of regular practice of physical activity to preserve muscle and bone mass during weight loss, especially in such kind of patients [107].",25c9489c-e9bf-4ecb-858a-3e3d16c923e1
33,methods33," On the other hand, adapted programs, including different types of moderate exercise not associated with a nutritional intervention [108], although they have been shown to improve overall physical and psychological health [109,110,111], were not able to reduce body weight and to improve dysmetabolism in older adults with overweight [112].  As for nutrition, MD, in its different variations, is commonly considered the best way to manage T2DM [46] due to the simplicity and frugality of the dishes it promotes, its versatility, the possibility of sporadically indulging in extra foods, its richness in healthy nutrients paired with a low caloric density, and its support to the microbiota [24,113,114].",749df5df-f67a-4c34-9794-c0c80cad874f
34,methods34," In this regard, a recent study found that in nine patients with T2DM, the increased adherence to MD after a three months NI resulted in beneficial changes in the GM profile, which seemed to precede the fasting plasma glycemia (FPG) and HOMA index reduction, hypothesizing a relevant role of the diet-related GM modulation on the metabolic improvement [115].  Nonetheless, new dietary approaches with lower carbohydrate quantities, such as very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), could be used to manage carbohydrate dysmetabolism better and promote greater weight loss even in the long term [73], but there are still little data concerning the effects of very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), especially in T2DM patients, on the GM.",177f6a97-b574-48b2-b0a3-fe0127385bc6
35,methods35," On this issue, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio that often characterizes the microbiota of obese patients [33] has shown only a slight modification after a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), while plasma metabolome and fecal bile acid composition present larger variations [116].  A study by Gutierrez-Repiso et al. [117] has compared the MD, KD, and Bariatric Surgery (BS; in this case, sleeve gastrectomy), showing that microbiota variations were related to the approach used. In particular, MD increased the activity of Short-Chain Fatty Acid (Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA)) producers, also known as metabolic regulators, while KD and BS presented common traits, such as Lactobacillus reduction. The effects of Lactobacillus on obesity seem to be species-dependent, i.e., some strains are linked to weight gain, others to weight loss [118].  Furthermore, a recent review by Rondanelli et al.",c10b9043-b93f-4fac-8336-2cbae408f890
36,methods36," has analyzed various types of KD [116], finding a reduction in Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) production and, among bacteria, the reduction of Roseburia and Eubacterium rectale, the two main producers of butyrate. In addition, an increase in Christensenellaceae and Akkermansia was also observed, while for F. prausnitzii, usually considered a marker of good health, data were mixed, and its low levels could be linked to the presence of T2DM [119].  In the same review, the analysis of the microbiota composition during the different phases of KD showed an initial reduction in Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus due to the lack of substrate to use, i.e., cereal fibers, and an increase in Bacteroides, probably due to the prevalence of proteins. Nonetheless, if proteins of vegetable origin are used, the increase in Bacteroides is reduced [120].",6f250925-37cd-48e1-b90b-839e53962824
37,methods37," On the other hand, in the phases of reintroduction of carbohydrate sources, recovery of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus was observed, suggesting that these changes are transient and more linked to the composition of diet than to weight loss. The reduction of Bifidobacteria may also promote a reduction of Th-17 cells, whose activation is associated with autoimmune diseases [121]. Other species that tend to increase are Alistipes and Parabacteroides [116].  To avoid damaging the microbiota and losing friendly species during KD, the review by Paoli et al. recommends using fermented foods which do not interfere with ketosis, the use of prebiotics and probiotics, a correct balance between omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids, and the presence of sources of monounsaturated fats (MUFA), such as olive oil. In addition, it suggests the restriction of animal proteins and the use of meal replacements, including vegetable proteins, such as pea-derived ones, along with whey proteins [122].",5ccb3c72-56e7-4c06-9146-a90ca464d1e5
38,methods38,"  Recently, a trial showed that the administration of a symbiotic, formed by Bifidobacteria and a prebiotic fiber, can improve weight loss and metabolic state during very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) by working on the microbiota with consequent reduction of inflammation. The influence on GM was apparently minimal, but Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) production was markedly increased [123]. This finding highlights that the use of probiotics and/or prebiotics could be encouraged in very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD)s and, in general, in slimming diets [124]. Avoiding sweeteners and particularly using the galacto-oligosaccharides and fructo-oligosaccharides bifidogenic fibers can further contribute to the health of the microbiota [122].",89c18a10-9c4d-4a38-95d5-6a036d8d9539
39,methods39,"  In our study, after three months of NI, both groups of patients had a significant weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) loss, but patients subjected to very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) showed a significantly higher reduction in body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), WC, and FM, compared to those following the MD, without any significant difference in FFM variations. The slight difference observed in the variation of the phA between the KETO and MD (MEDI) groups in the third month of NI could be attributed to slight dehydration and a reduction of cell metabolism in the KETO group. In fact, the phA is known as a marker of cell integrity, and its association with good adherence to MD has been reported [54]. On the other hand, the metabolic status improved similarly in both groups.",4cb59971-0b82-4eda-aa90-56683a2410a3
40,methods40," In particular, the HbA1c value, a marker of diabetes glycometabolic control, showed a more significant decrease in the KETO group after three months of NI; however, the comparison of variations obtained at T3 between the two groups did not show any significant difference. This finding is similar to the result obtained by Gardner et al., who compared the metabolic effects of a well-formulated KD and an MD in a study including patients with pre-diabetes and T2DM. However, these authors did not report any significant difference in weight loss between the two diets [125]. As regards weight loss, our results partly confirm those of Moriconi et al., who reported a statistically significant Body Mass Index (BMI) reduction exclusively in patients with T2DM and obesity following a three months very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) compared to a control group following a standard low-calorie diet (low calorie diet (LCD)) [126].",b0760df6-96ab-47aa-83cb-a16200e74161
41,methods41," In this study, very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), but not low calorie diet (LCD), was also associated with a significant reduction of HbA1c values and a significant improvement in eating patterns and quality of life [126].  In our patients, the lifestyle evaluation highlighted an improvement in eating habits in both groups, with an increase in adherence to MD not only in the MD (MEDI) group, according to expectations, but also in the KETO group, which significantly increased the daily intake of fish and vegetables. However, it should be pointed out that the follow-up assessment was performed after three months of NI when both groups were following a similar dietary protocol based on MD principles. This result is in line with the study of Landry et al., who found a similar mean adherence between ketogenic and Mediterranean diets among patients with prediabetes or T2DM [127].",c29056b3-faca-4b2a-b4ff-c2eab9467eb7
42,methods42," On the contrary, the mean value of physical activity level did not vary during the intervention period, although, considering individual data, four out of eleven patients enrolled (two in each group) who were sedentary at baseline became moderately active at T3. In this regard, it should be emphasized that most of the data were collected during the lockdown period in Italy (March–May 2020), with obvious logistical difficulties and complications for the subjects of the study to carry out structured and outdoor physical activity. Moreover, unlike for NI, for physical activity, no specific indications, but only general recommendations, have been given, and the assessment was performed based on self-reported data using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) but not objectively measured [128].",42042b88-110d-4d4d-8fac-a4c881149802
43,methods43,"  Furthermore, the KETO group showed a significant improvement in both physical and mental synthetic scores on the quality of life questionnaire, while the MD (MEDI) group showed a slight reduction. The comparison of the variations between the two groups at T3 was also significant. This result could be related to an improved perceived mood and energy level previously described after a low-glucose, not ketogenic diet compared to a high-glucose [129], and, limited to physical component summary (PCS), also reported in women affected by ovarian or endometrial cancer after 12 weeks of KD [130]. Moreover, a significant improvement in physical and mental health scores of the SF-36 questionnaire was found in diabetic patients subjected to very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in the aforementioned study by Moriconi et al. [126].",295d613e-4d0b-47ce-b0c8-b078cf85f8d8
44,methods44,"  Concerning the short-term impact of the two dietary models on GM, we first evaluated whether the gut microbial community was different, at baseline, between the two study groups by evaluating alpha and beta diversity. Specifically, we observed a significantly greater evenness of the microbial structure in the KETO group than in the MD (MEDI) group at baseline, although significance was lost over time. However, neither the richness of the number of species nor the Shannon index (a mathematical expression that combines species richness and evenness as a measure of alpha diversity) was significantly different between the two study groups.",e72ca184-6d93-4c46-8e48-603a93106489
45,methods45," As regards the beta diversity, PERMANOVA analysis indicated a significant difference based on the Bray-Curtis distance matrix between the GM communities of KETO and MD (MEDI) only at baseline, although the beta diversity based on the unweighted and weighted UniFrac metrics across the two nutritional groups did not show any statistically significant difference at baseline and over time. Nonetheless, it should be pointed out that at baseline, there was no significant difference in anthropometric, clinical, or lifestyle variables between the two study groups.  No statistically significant differences in all alpha and beta diversity indices throughout treatments were observed. It should be emphasized that although significant differences are found at higher microbiome resolution, these are not always confirmed by differences in summary metrics such as alpha and beta diversity, as observed after NI on other study cohorts [60,131].",28952314-d862-49fe-af93-bc465dc5fc7d
46,methods46,"  Although some volunteers presented huge variations in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio along the NI, no statistically significant differences between time points in both diet groups were detected.  By deepening GM characterization through taxonomic analysis, by means of the Generalized Linear Mixed-effects Model, confirmed after multiple testing corrections, with a cut-off at q ≤ 0.25, we observed several significant microbial markers associated with the NI and, but almost exclusively with the ketogenic one. Results were ranked by their MaAsLin2 coefficient: the Verrucomicrobiota phylum was identified as the main biomarker in KETO, together with its members Verrucomicrobiae, Verrucomicrobiales, Akkermansiaceae, and Akkermansia, both at T2 and T3 of NI.",970a305b-082b-494b-95e2-0e62e352a318
47,methods47," Interestingly, these beneficial taxa showed a significant increase up to three months of NI in KETO but not in MD (MEDI), although in the former, the NI at the end of phase T3 corresponded to the low-calorie MD of the MD (MEDI) group, whereas the T2 of KETO corresponded to the end of the ketosis phases. Akkermansia muciniphila represents the most studied microorganism belonging to these taxa, which is considered a significant biomarker of intestinal homeostasis, whose physiological effects in promoting intestinal integrity for its capacity to stimulate the mucous turnover rate are well documented [132,133]. A. muciniphila contributes to intestinal health and glucose homeostasis [132,134] and has been shown to improve the metabolic status and clinical outcomes after a dietary intervention in overweight/obese adults [135], and have protective effects on diet-induced obesity [136,137].",52ab0159-5eaa-483f-a62d-03e021d5566d
48,methods48," Moreover, it has been proposed to regulate adipose tissue metabolism and the accumulation of fat [138] and its increase has been associated with KD [116]. A. muciniphila supplementation in patients with overweight/obesity was associated with reduced inflammation marker levels and improved several metabolic parameters [139], while in animal models of diabetes and obesity restored the integrity of the epithelial mucosa, improved glucose tolerance, and metabolic parameters [140]. Contrariwise, its depletion has been associated with many diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic disorders [141]. As confirmation of their beneficial effect, the Verrucomicrobia phylum, together with its members Verrucomicrobiaceae, Akkermansia, and Akkermansia muciniphila, was identified as the main biomarker in centenarian subjects [32,142,143,144].",cb6aef91-a775-4859-8c2f-443a88e6ff3a
49,methods49," Within the Firmicutes phylum, the strongest associations were also related to the Christensenellales order and Christensenellaceae family both at T2 and T3 of very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), as previously described [116]. An unclassified genus and species from Christensenellaceae_R.7_group were also strongly associated, albeit with a lower MaAsLin2 coefficient.  This constitutes an interesting finding on the impact of the ketogenic diet on obese patients with T2DM, considering that a reduction in Christensenellaceae was observed in individuals with pre-type 2 diabetes [145]. Christensenellaceae are involved in the fermentation of proteins and fibers and have been associated with a diet low in refined sugars and high in fruit and vegetables, with a consumption of dairy products and an increase in animal products in the diet [146].",a6797abb-0d16-4d55-b57c-0af56709b4d1
50,methods50," These pieces of evidence are consistent with a protein and non-starchy vegetable intake in the first sixty days of the ketogenic diet in KETO, followed by the gradual introduction of fruit, dairy products, legumes, and cereals until T3. Furthermore, Goodrich et al. showed that the inoculation of the obese human microbiome in germ-free mice fed a high-fiber diet induced a reduction in adiposity only in mice receiving fecal transplant modified with the addition of Christensenella minuta, compared to those receiving unmodified stools or stools containing non-viable C. minuta [147].  Interestingly, the Christensenellaceae family has been associated with a lean phenotype, negatively correlated with visceral fat mass, trunk fat, android fat [102], waist circumference, and waist/hip ratio [146]; and it is increased after a reduction in body weight in obese postmenopausal women following NI [148].",394137dd-6558-46df-b763-b8e42518dab2
51,methods51," These data are consistent with a significantly greater reduction in body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), WC, and FM in our KETO cohort compared to MD (MEDI), in which no significant increase in these bacteria taxa was observed.  The Christensenellaceae family has also been negatively associated with dyslipidemia [149,150] and positively associated with healthy glucose metabolism [151,152]. Consistently, fasting blood glucose showed a greater improvement, although not significant, in the KETO group than in MD (MEDI); moreover, as regards the value of HbA1c, a more significant decrease was reported in the KETO group after three months of NI. Similarly to the Verrucomicrobia phylum and its members, Christensenellaceae has also been associated with human longevity [142,144,153,154], being a marker of human health.",a236bc16-e599-4bbb-9b46-25d0b15403e3
52,methods52,"  In the KETO group, the T2 and T3 time points also shared the increase, within the Firmicutes phylum, in some taxa belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family (the unclassified species from Eubacterium xylanophilum group and Eubacterium eligens group, and their related genera) and in the unclassified Family Peptococcaceae species. In line with the typical dietary regimen of our cohorts, the presence of Eubacterium spp. in the gut has been associated with increased intake of dietary fibers, as several species are able to utilize digestion-resistant complex carbohydrates [155]. In addition, the abundance of Eubacterium spp. can be positively modulated following a diet rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which our KETO patients took as a supplement [155]. For their beneficial implications, such as the modulation of gut inflammation through Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA)s, multiple species of the Eubacterium genus are currently considered promising targets for therapeutic strategies.",e58c7ace-5bce-4ebb-a2c7-7d1c8720c9af
53,methods53,"  As regards the Peptococcaceae family, Sha Di et al. in 2019 observed that fatty acids produced by many bacteria, such as the Peptococcaceae family, are involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity, as well as choline, produced by the same family [156]. Previous studies also found that fasting serum levels of glycerol, monounsaturated fatty acids, and saturated fatty acids are strongly associated with a lower abundance of Peptococcaceae, while polyunsaturated fatty acids, including omega-6, docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), omega 3 and linoleic acid are positively associated [145]. Furthermore, the role of Peptococcaceae has yet to be defined, given that they have been negatively associated with pathological conditions [157] but also identified as biomarkers of the chronic progressive disease course of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (CP-EAE) [158].",23b320bc-9ca4-4bb2-969c-e9dd5fdf33a2
54,methods54,"  The T2 and T3 time points also share a significant reduction in Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota phyla and in the Alistipes genus (Bacteroidota phylum). The reduction in Firmicutes is not surprising, considering that this phylum was significantly increased in obesity, as well as several of its members that express propionate production pathways [159,160], and was reduced in obese patients following a moderately hypocaloric MD [60]. With regards to the Actinobacteria phylum, it was found to be elevated in obese patients [32,161], while Alistipes is implicated in colorectal cancer and associated with depression and inflammation [162].",b4d55fd7-3545-4029-a0ed-658177ab9596
55,methods55,"  With reference only to the ketosis phase, therefore to the T2 time point, we observed the reduction in several taxa belonging to the Firmicutes phylum and, in particular, the Clostridia class, the order Peptostreptococcales, Tissierellales, and the order Oscillospirales, together with its members Ruminococcaceae family (and its Subdoligranulum genus) and Lachnospiraceae family (and its Anaerostipes, Dorea, Agathobacter, and Fusicatenibacter genera). The Alistipes shahii species belonging to the Bacteroidota phylum was also reduced. The reduction in members of the Lachnospiraceae family following KD is not surprising, considering that it was also observed as a consequence of other hypocaloric diets (high protein, fiber-rich, or with prebiotic supplementation) [60,159,160,163]. Members of this family can hydrolyze starch and other sugars to produce butyrate and other Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA)s and play a central role in the mechanisms of bacterial cross-feeding [164].",e9adbca2-bf74-4485-a5fd-be5291f8cf25
56,methods56," Although Lachnospiraceae are known as beneficial bacteria, their increased proliferation has been associated with metabolic diseases in both human and animal studies and with obesity [32]. At the same time, higher Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) production (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) was associated with intestinal dysbiosis and obesity [165,166], and emerging evidence indicates the pathological effects, in various disorders, including obesity, of specific Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA), such as acetate and propionate [167,168].  As regards Subdoligranulum, higher abundances were observed in GIT neoplasms [169], and its association with chronic inflammation and poor metabolic control [170], with blood markers of inflammation and endotoxemia in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) [171] has been demonstrated.",26daa9b1-f032-4b99-b5e2-2e0e49654858
57,methods57,"  At the end of the ketosis phase, the Intestinimonas genus belonging to the Oscillospiraceae family (Firmicutes phylum) and the Peptococcales order with its members Peptococcaceae and an unclassified genus from Peptococcaceae family (Firmicutes phylum) were increased. Interestingly, Intestinimonas was found to be elevated in diabetic models of mice undergoing treatment with Lycium barbarum (Lycium barbarum (LBP)), a polysaccharide used to alleviate T2DM through the modulation of intestinal microbiota [172]. Moreover, in Swedish subjects naive for diabetes treatment and grouped by glycemic status, Intestinimonas was found to be depleted in the group with impaired fasting glucose (impaired fasting glucose (IFG)) [173], while an increased abundance of Intestinimonas butyriciproducens and Akkermansia muciniphila has been reported, together with improvements in glucose and insulin sensitivity, in high cardiometabolic risk subjects following an MD [174,175].",d26082e3-0859-4a3e-b0ea-096b28bfd251
58,methods58,"  A further result of our research was the strong association at T3 in the KETO group of the UCG 010 family and its unclassified members at genus and species level (Firmicutes phylum) as a consequence of the NI from T2 to T3 and from T0 to T3. It should be noted that these taxa, whose physiological role remains to be defined, were not significantly increased at T2 compared to T0; therefore, they were associated with the MD only after following the KD.  Lachnoclostridium was found to be depleted at the end of T3, both in T3 versus T0 and in T3 versus T2, but not in T2 compared to T0.",deeec9d2-0103-4fe5-ace8-d05b3ee8ce12
59,methods59," Interestingly, despite Lachnoclostridium harboring species that produce Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA)s, mainly butyrate, to which favorable immunomodulating actions are ascribed [176,177], its reduction was observed in Diabetes-Induced Cognitive Impairment (Diabetes Induced Cognitive Impairment (DCI)) models following the treatment with the bioactive compound tanshinone IIA (tanshinone IIA (TAN)) [178], or in mice with T2DM following the anti-hyperglycemic treatment [179].  Concerning the Tannerellaceae family and its members, Parabacteroides and Parabacteroides distasonis (Bacteroidota phylum), we have observed an inconsistent trend throughout the NI in the KETO group. In particular, these taxa increased at T2 compared with baseline and decreased at T3 compared with T2, without significant variation between T0 and T3, suggesting that their increase is strictly associated with the purely ketogenic diet. A significant decrease in the relative abundance of Parabacteroides genus and P.",99ece8b2-f646-4b9c-89b1-a15921518388
60,methods60," distasonis species was observed in Sardinian obese patients [32], consistent with what was previously observed by Del Chierico et al., which have associated both Parabacteroides and Parabacteroides distasonis with normal body weight [180]. The metabolic benefits of Parabacteroides distasonis on decreasing weight gain, hyperglycemia, and hepatic steatosis in ob/ob and high-fat diet (high fat diet (HFD))-fed mice have also been reported [181], although its administration has been shown to induce depressive-like behavior in mouse models [182].  Our research highlighted the significant change in some taxa limited to the comparison between T3 and baseline in the KETO group. Specifically, the increase in the order Clostridia UCG.014 and its unclassified family, genus, and species taxa, together with the increase in the unclassified Genus UCG.005 species belonging to the family Oscillospiraceae was observed; whereas the reduction in the X.Ruminococcus.",c2fe4f6d-7f91-4979-87b8-ffe84c686782
61,methods61,"_torques_group genus (Firmicutes) and Bacteroidota phylum together with several of its members, such as the Bacteroidales order and the Bacteroides (Bacteroidaceae), Barnesiella (Barnesiellaceae) and Butyricimonas (Marinifilaceae) genera has also been observed. The biological relevance of the increase in Clostridia UCG.014 needs further investigation, as a study on the effect of berberine on hyperglycemia and gut microbiota composition in type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats showed a decrease [183]. On the other hand, to support our findings, Clostridia_UCG-014 was found to be significantly elevated as a consequence of physical activity in more active older adults with insomnia and positively correlated with physical activity levels [184].",645c9a49-6c5e-46c6-8c5f-295b1b950ba0
62,methods62," It should be pointed out that despite the mean value of physical activity level did not vary during the intervention period in our study, four out of twelve patients enrolled (two in each study group) who were sedentary at baseline became moderately active at T3.  The Ruminococcus torques group significantly decreased at T3 in our KETO group, which is thought to be a detrimental factor in diabetic nephropathy together with the genera Alistipes, Bacteroides, Subdoligranulum, and Lachnoclostridium [185]. In addition, Ruminococcus torques decreased after bariatric surgery and diabetes remission [186].  As regards the MD (MEDI) group, we observed that no taxa varied significantly after two months of the dietary protocol.",5f4dce1e-aebe-4d43-b485-8641b0adc46e
63,methods63," The Actinobacteroidota phylum was identified as the only biomarker after three months of NI; while, by comparing the GM communities of T2 and T3 time points, in addition to Actinobacteroidota, strong associations were also related to the Firmicutes phylum at T3 and to Desulfobacterota phylum and an unclassified species from the Bacteroides genus at T2. A recent systematic review of the changes in intestinal microbial profiles caused by T2DM treatment [187] identified an increase in Actinobacteria following Roux-Y gastric bypass (Roux Y gastric bypass (RYGB)) [186,188]. Furthermore, an increase in Actinobacteria concurrently with that of Firmicutes has been observed in most of the studies analyzed, and that increase in Actinobacteria was associated with better glycemic control or lipid profile at follow-up [187], hypothesizing the involvement of these two bacterial phyla on better glycemic control.",ab2c250f-0fbc-44ae-92a5-8810b4f4b5ec
64,methods64," In fact, the genus Bifidobacterium, belonging to the Actinobacteroidota phylum, has protective effects in T2DM as it is involved in the production of Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) precursors and in the regulation of glucose homeostasis [189,190].  Concerning the comparative prediction analysis of the functional metagenome, in the KETO group, the strongest associations were related to steroid and carotenoid biosynthesis and non-homologous end joining (non homologous end joining (NHEJ)) pathways both at T2 and T3 compared with baseline. Carotenoids are molecules with antioxidants and nutraceutical functions, beneficial for human health, to the point of considering the use of microbiological systems for their biotechnological production [191]. The non homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway constitutes a type of double-stranded DNA repair pathway (DNA repair pathway (DSB)) predominant in human cells that prevents genomic instability, and its deregulation can promote carcinogenesis [192].",812ba5b4-2a25-4991-9783-ded74738297d
65,methods65," Steroid hormones are used in the treatment and prophylaxis of various acute and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [193]. Despite their effectiveness, glucocorticoids (GC) have been associated with a high risk of developing hyperglycemia and overt DM [194,195,196]. In light of their side effects, further studies are needed to clarify the physiological significance of the increase in steroid biosynthesis in our patients, given that KETO showed, instead, an improvement in the anthropometric and metabolic status.  Overall, we have observed in KETO after NI the reduction in the degradation pathways of different alkylbenzenes, such as benzoate, ethylbenzene, and xylenes, while toluene was significantly increased at T2. Moreover, limonene and pinene degradation were strongly and negatively associated in the same cohort.",eab12e04-9daf-4300-950c-27fe3ba13d9e
66,methods66," The significance of the reduction in this pathway should be investigated to understand whether it can be considered a direct consequence of the diet or of the reduction in blood glucose levels. Indeed, limonene was shown to reduce hyperglycemia and attenuate diabetes-associated complications, while pinene has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia and exert antioxidant activity in diabetic rats [197].  We also observed an increase in other glycan degradation pathways over time (significant at T2) and in two-component system pathways over time (significant at T3). A depletion in glycan metabolism in obese patients was observed in previous studies [32], [180,198], while two-component signal transduction systems, a communication system through which bacteria adapt their cellular physiology to changes in the environment, was found to be increased in healthy long-lived subjects [199].",15bcc2ff-2d99-4fff-b45c-3c5e4af45061
67,methods67,"  Consistent with the results of the taxonomic analysis, no pathway was significantly associated with MD (MEDI) over time.  5. Conclusions  Our study suggested the potential benefits of a very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) protocol in drug-naïve patients with T2DM and overweight/obesity, at least in the short term. In particular, these benefits seem to be higher than those observed with a classical MD regarding weight loss and the impact on GM, although further investigations are needed.  Indeed, the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has shown greater improvements in anthropometric measures (weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), FM%, and WC) and in quality of life compared to the MD. Nevertheless, changes in metabolic variables were not statistically significant between the two diets. The results also highlighted an improvement in eating habits, with an increase in adherence to MD in both groups.",721fee27-ac5b-47bb-b35b-aef6cf996774
68,methods68," The progressive shift to a Mediterranean-style diet after two months of KD allows patients not to be excessively restrictive about many food groups and to reduce their carbon footprint. Still, physical activity levels remained unchanged in both groups.  Consistently, our findings highlight a more beneficial impact of the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) on the intestinal microbial phenotype, suggesting that this diet could be considered a valid approach to managing newly diagnosed diseases without drugs.",753e0e9a-e36b-461e-92eb-278990013e21
69,methods69," Overall, in the KETO group, both after two months (ketosis phase) and after 3 months of NI (shift to MD), there was a significant increase in biomarkers of intestinal homeostasis, such as Verrucomicrobiota phylum with its members Verrucomicrobiae, Verrucomicrobiales, Akkermansiaceae, and Akkermansia, as well as in microbial taxa associated with a lean phenotype and with a healthy glucose metabolism, such as the Christensenellaceae family and in beneficial taxa capable of modulating gut inflammation through Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA)s production (Eubacterium spp.); while the reduction in microbial taxa previously associated with obesity (Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota) or other diseases (Alistipes) was observed. Greater clarity must be made regarding the association of the Peptococcaceae family due to the discordant data in the literature on their beneficial role.",9b2afe6f-4956-47d9-b307-5eec407aa876
70,methods70,"  The ketosis phase (T2) was associated with the reduction in taxa belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family, in taxa associated with GIT neoplasms and poor metabolic control (Subdoligranulum) and with the increase in taxa already shown to be enriched in diabetic mice undergoing treatment to alleviate type 2 diabetes through the modulation of intestinal microbiota. (Intestinimonas).  Phase T3 of the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) was associated with taxa whose physiological role remains to be defined (UCG 010 family, unclassified UCG 010 genus and species, and Clostridia_UCG-014), with taxa previously associated with physical activity in pathogen models (Oscillospiraceae UCG-005) and with the reduction in taxa for which a lower abundance in mice with T2DM following the anti-hyperglycemic treatments (Lachnoclostridium) and a lower abundance after bariatric surgery and diabetes remission (Ruminococcus torques group) had already been demonstrated.",5d1d32de-b367-4c2e-89f3-af7462b5b789
71,methods71,"  An inconsistent trend (increase at T2 compared with baseline and decrease at T3 compared with T2, without variation between T0 and T3) was found for taxa associated with leanness and metabolic benefits (Parabacteroides and P. distasonis), although its administration has been shown to induce depressive-like behavior in mouse models.  On the other hand, our findings indicate that the MD, at least in the short term, has less impact on the GM of patients with T2DM and obesity compared to the very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), the significance of which needs further investigation. We can hypothesize that for MD, a longer-lasting NI and greater weight loss are needed to induce more significant changes in GM composition.",3f41fd20-37d5-41a3-b9a9-c401be6d514f
72,methods72,"  Consistent with the results of the taxonomic analysis, no pathway was significantly associated with MD (MEDI) over time, whereas the strongest associations were related to steroid and carotenoid biosynthesis and to non-homologous end-joining pathways in KETO cohort; in the same cohort, penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis, limonene and pinene degradation and ethylbenzene degradation pathways were strongly and negatively associated.  Our study is limited by its small sample size due to the COVID-19 pandemic and especially to the lockdown period that forced the interruption of the enrollment of patients; moreover, a female patient assigned to the MD (MEDI) group has been excluded during the follow-up period due to the COVID-19 infection, further reducing the number of patients of MD (MEDI) group.",80a56196-fba2-4b3b-bcbf-0d8752ba80d3
73,methods73,"  Therefore, despite the potential benefits obtained with the ketogenic diet in the short term, these findings need to be confirmed by larger study cohorts with longer follow-ups to validate the use of KD as an effective dietary model in the treatment of newly diagnosed T2DM with obesity. In the same way, greater sample sizes and longer-lasting therapeutic interventions are needed to confirm the impact of the Mediterranean diet in the same patient category and the extent of its effectiveness compared to the ketogenic diet.
