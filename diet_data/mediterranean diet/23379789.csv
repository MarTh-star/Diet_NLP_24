0,introduction0,"Olive oil is the principal source of lipids in the Mediterranean diet, with “extra virgin” olive oil (Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)) referring to an oil fraction produced via mechanical rather than chemical extraction of olives at temperatures that limit effects on intrinsic properties of the oil [1], [2]. The principal components of Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) are triglycerides (TG, 98–99%) predominantly esterified with monounsaturated oleic acid (OA), and to a lesser extent palmitic, linoleic (LA) and linolenic acids [3]–[5].  Multiple health benefits are linked with diets rich in olive oil and the Mediterranean diet in general, including anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive effects that lead to a reduced risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [6]–[8]. Notably, the Mediterranean diet is also linked with the consumption of fruits and vegetables that are rich in the inorganic anions nitrite (NO2 −) and nitrate (NO3 −) [9], [10].",f1e4e379-8ff9-4a87-96da-63ad8e153976
1,introduction1," These species are also metastable nitric oxide (NO) oxidation products in vivo. Collectively, these oxides of nitrogen undergo further reactions in the blood and tissues via enzymatic and non-enzymatic reductive metabolism and by the oxidizing, nitrosating and nitrating conditions promoted by digestion, mitochondrial respiration and inflammation [11]. In the case of NO3 −, the commensal bacteria of the enterosalivary system reduce dietary NO3 − to physiologically-significant levels of NO2 −, NO and secondary species [12]. There is also an emerging body of evidence from higher plants that NO and other reactive species mediate nitro-oxidative reactions that regulate plant stress perception, signal transduction and senescence responses. Integral to these events is the redox-mediated formation of heme and protein thiol nitrosyl adducts and protein 3-nitrotyrosine adducts [13].",91cd51ad-8ca3-4b26-9091-44043b7555a6
2,introduction2," Considering that plants in general, and fresh olives in particular, are abundant in readily-nitrated unsaturated fatty acids, the present study evaluated whether electrophilic fatty acid nitroalkene derivatives (NO2-FA) are a) endogenously present in olives, b) extractable into the Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) fraction and c) generated after consumption of olive lipids by the acidic conditions of digestion.  Fatty acid nitroalkenes are detectable clinically and in rodent models as free, esterified and protein-adducted species [14], but have not been reported in plants. In mammals, these species are present in low basal concentrations and are formed at greater concentrations by the radical addition reaction of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to unsaturated fatty acids. The endogenous generation of NO2 occurs via multiple acid-catalyzed and oxidative inflammatory reactions involving NO and NO2 − [15].",4fe66c4a-23fb-4ea5-bd7b-24133bae6a84
3,introduction3," Biochemical studies and cell models revealed that NO2-FA are electrophilic, if the nitro group is adducted to alkenyl carbons. These species rapidly react via Michael addition with thiols and to a lesser extent primary and secondary amines [16].  Once generated, NO2-FA signal by reversibly alkylating susceptible thiols of multiple transcriptional regulatory proteins, thus affecting downstream gene expression and the metabolic and inflammatory responses under their regulation. Via this mechanism, NO2-FA activate Nrf2-dependent antioxidant gene expression by adduction of critical thiols in the Nrf2 regulatory protein Keap1 [17]. NO2-FA also inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine, adhesion protein and enzyme expression by adduction of the NF-κB p65 subunit and inhibition of DNA binding by p65 [18].",c6147317-048f-442e-8beb-96c010a89600
4,introduction4," NO2-FA are also partial agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), which NO2-FA activate via hydrogen bonding interactions and covalent adduction of the ligand binding domain Cys285 [19]. Finally, NO2-FA limit inflammatory responses by non-cGMP-dependent inhibition of platelet and neutrophil function [20], [21] and by inhibiting the catalytic activity and gene expression of the pro-inflammatory proteins cyclooxygenase-2 and xanthine oxidoreductase [22], [23]. Via these pleiotropic mechanisms, murine models reveal that NO2-FA limit pathologies linked with obesity, ischemic episodes, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and surgical procedures such as angioplasty [24]–[29].  Herein, we report the endogenous presence of NO2-FA in plants, specifically in olives and Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and show the additional formation of NO2-FA from Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) under conditions which mimic gastric pH and NO2 − concentrations during digestion.",2afe8e3a-61f0-4bae-8458-de78db30217b
5,introduction5, It is speculated that the dietary consumption and physiologic generation of electrophilic anti-inflammatory lipids contribute to the physiological benefits of unsaturated fatty acid-rich diets.  ,495b6252-f62b-4ca1-9e38-868f1b3e333b

This study examined the endogenous content of NO2-FA in fresh olives and Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and the potential for their further formation when Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was subjected to the gastric milieu [24], [26], [30], [44]–[50]. These analyses were motivated by the detection of fatty acid nitroalkenes in rodents and humans and an appreciation that these electrophilic species induce beneficial metabolic and inflammatory signaling responses.  To avoid ion suppression from native fatty acids in the HPLC-MS/MS identification of the less abundant fatty acid nitroalkenes in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), glycerides were hydrolyzed by triacylglycerol lipase to free fatty acids that were then subjected to chromatographic separation.",509b9a8f-094b-4a81-9454-e286446c8d0e

Under these conditions, there was significant NO2-OA, NO2-LA and NO2-cLA generation, with 9-NO2-cLA and 12-NO2-cLA the most prevalent (Figure 2B).  The electrophilic character of NO2-FA in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was confirmed by HPLC-MS/MS detection of Michael reaction products in fresh olives (Figure 4) [38]. Notably, NO2-OA-cysteine adducts were endogenously present in olives, where there was a stable pool of protein-adducted nitroalkene derivatives in the peel and mesocarp of different olive cultivars (Figure 5).",086b5bf3-ef3b-47d5-bd8c-edd5ed263f0d
29,discussion4," These results confirm that Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and olives are both a source and metabolic reserve of NO2-FA.  Electrophilic nitroalkenes exert signaling actions via the modulation of the expression and activity of both anti-inflammatory [32] and pro-inflammatory enzymes [23]. These effects are entirely dependent on the post-translational modification of transcription factors, enzymes and and other protein targets via Michael addition. Conjugated linoleic acid displays immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory effects [51], [52], with the mechanisms accounting for these actions proposed to include the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels via inhibition of NF-κB-dependent gene expression and activation of PPAR-regulated gene expression [51], [52]. Of significance, very high and non-physiological concentrations of native cLA and other unsaturated fatty acids are required to exert these effects.",1f8e0f2c-e322-420f-b25f-23360e245e76
30,discussion5," In contrast, after fatty acid nitration and conferral of electrophilic reactivity, NO2-FA potently modulate these same pathways at nM concentrations [46], [54]. Additionally, NO2-FA activate Nrf2-regulated anti-inflammatory gene expression and heat shock factor-regulated heat shock protein expression [17], [46], [55]. This is explained by the facile and reversible Michael addition of NO2-FA with susceptible thiols of specific protein targets, thus requiring only low concentrations and rates of generation of electrophilic lipids to result in the accumulation of target protein adduction and instigation of downstream signaling responses [16], [54]. Consequently, electrophilic lipids which are present in plants, generated by digestion of plant lipids, produced by oxidative inflammatory reactions or administered as pure synthetic homologs [24], [26], [47], [56], can regulate metabolism and the resolution of inflammatory processes.",a4efbb44-82db-482a-b097-a93818193c7b
31,discussion6," In this regard, olives and Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) serve as both a direct source of and precursors for NO2-FA generation.  Supporting Information Figure S1  High resolution mass spectrometry analysis of NO2-cLA in Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Extra virgin olive oil was hydrolyzed and extracted by solid phase extraction for HPLC-MS/MS analysis.
