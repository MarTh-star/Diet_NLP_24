0,methods0," Subjects  Forty-three adult (age: mean = 9.0, range = 8.2–10.4 years, estimated by dentition), female cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), were obtained (Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, USA SRC, Alice, TX) and housed at the Wake Forest School of Medicine Primate Center (Winston-Salem, NC) . Briefly, the monkeys were socially housed in groups of 3–4 and consumed standard monkey chow (Table 1) during an eight-month baseline phase, after which pens were assigned to receive either the Western (five groups, n = 21) or Mediterranean (six groups, n = 22) diet, balanced on pretreatment characteristics that reflected overall health, including body weight, body mass index, circulating basal cortisol, total plasma concentrations, and plasma triglyceride concentrations . Two monkeys did not tolerate the experimental diet, and were switched to standard monkey chow, three animals died during the course of the study (discussed in Frye et al.",902351d7-59f8-4ffd-8bbc-0b5b931dc4de
1,methods1,", 2021), and three samples were removed for insufficient CD14 purification (see ‘Removal of Batch Effects’ below), resulting in a final sample size of 35 animals (Western n = 20, Mediterranean n = 15). All animal manipulations were performed according to the guidelines of state and federal laws, the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Animal Care and Use Committee of Wake Forest School of Medicine.  Experimental diets  Experimental diets (Table 1) were formulated to be isocaloric with respect to protein, fat, and carbohydrates, and identical in cholesterol content (~ 320 mg/2000 kilocalories (Cals)/day) as previously described .  Behavioral characterization  Behavioral data were collected weekly during two 10 min focal observations, balanced for time of day, for 6 weeks during the baseline phase (2 hr/monkey total) and for 14 months during the experimental phase (mean = 17.6 hr/monkey total).",4ae7e5fc-ff76-4627-82fe-b649e0123205
2,methods2," Behaviors recorded included the frequency of aggressive and submissive behaviors, time spent in positive social interactions such as sitting in body contact and grooming or alone, and anxious behavior defined as self-directed behaviors including self-grooming and scratching (Maestripieri et al., 1992; Schino et al., 1996; Shively et al., 2015; Troisi et al., 2000; Troisi, 2002). Behaviors were collected as previously described (Shively, 1998), and combined into summary behaviors (e.g. ‘aggression’ was a combination of all total, noncontact, contact aggressive events). No significant differences in behavior were observed between the diet groups while consuming standard monkey chow diet during the baseline period (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B). In order to quantify the overall impact of diet on behavior, we conducted a principal component analysis using the R package FactoMineR . We corrected for multiple hypothesis tests using the Holm-Bonferroni adjusted p-values.",6fbebb47-dcb6-49c6-a616-aca7e4a3d39b
3,methods3,"  Blood sample collection  The monkeys were trained to run out of their social groups on voice command. Blood was drawn via venipuncture within 9 min of entering the building. Blood was collected into EDTA-containing tubes, mixed with an equal amount of PBS without calcium or magnesium, and overlaid on a 90% Ficoll-Paque Plus/10% PBS solution in LeucoSep tubes followed by centrifugation at 800 x g for 20 min. Isolated PBMCs were then immediately used for the collection of CD14+ monocytes by positive selection using a Miltenyi bead-based protocol following manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). After assessing cell viability and numbers, CD14+ monocytes were stored in 85% FBS, 15% DMSO sterile freezing media at −80°C and transferred to liquid nitrogen for storage until RNA extraction. Blood samples were collected from all subjects in a given social group on the same day and collection order was alternated between diets and randomized by group.",ed9f3510-6f95-4d62-8b35-09c361308a09
4,methods4,"  RNA extraction and sequencing  RNA was extracted from monocytes using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc, Hilden, Germany), and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with RNA 6000 Nano chips (Agilent Technology, Inc, Santa Clara, CA). RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing by the Cancer Genomics Shared Resource (Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC) using the TruSeq-stranded total RNA kit (Illumina), which includes a ribosomal depletion step. The RNA-seq libraries were then sequenced using single-end 76 bp reads on an Illumina NextSeq 500 to an average read depth of 34.5 million reads per sample (range 25.9–41.6 million reads). Reads were mapped to the Macaca fascicularis reference genome (Macaca_fascicularis_5.0, v 93, Ensembl)  using HiSat2  and then converted to a sample-by-gene read count matrix using featureCounts  (median = 38.",7328618a-3a3f-4294-80dd-9cb14182c115
5,methods5,"0%; range 24.5–50.4% of reads mapped to exons). Sample processing order was randomized and where possible all samples were manipulated simultaneously so as to avoid introducing batch effects.  Read count normalization and removal of batch effects  First, we removed genes with low expression (median reads per kilobase per million reads mapped < 1), which resulted in 12,240 genes for downstream analyses. We normalized read counts using the voom function of the R package limma . While investigating monocyte purity, three samples differed in CD3 gene expression from the rest by several orders of magnitude. We concluded that these samples were contaminated with CD3+ cells (i.e. inefficient CD14 purification, Appendix 2—figure 2) and excluded them from all analyses, leaving a final sample size of 35 monkeys (n = 20 fed the Western diet, n = 15 Mediterranean diet).",f8e3bb9d-074d-46fd-9572-b3c6cd01afda
6,methods6," To control for batch effects related to RNA quality and monocyte purity, we calculated the residual gene expression from a model of normalized gene expression as a function of CD14 expression, CD3 expression, RNA integrity, and RNA concentration. These residual gene expression values were used for all subsequent analyses.  Modeling effect of diet on gene expression  In order to determine which genes were significantly affected by diet, we modeled the residual expression of each gene as a function of diet using a linear mixed effects model controlling for relatedness among monkeys using the R package EMMREML (Akdemir and Godfrey, 2015). Relatedness was estimated using the ngsRelate program  with SNP genotypes inferred from the RNA-seq reads using bcftools mpileup . We calculated an empirical false discovery rate (false discovery rate (FDR)) for each gene using a permutation-based approach (Snyder-Mackler et al.",83d1fb94-530f-4079-9099-59cad2ec34c1
7,methods7,", 2016), and report genes that passed at false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. To examine global patterns of variation in gene expression, we conducted principal component analysis on the correlation matrix of normalized residual gene expression using the prcomp function in R.  Enrichment analyses  Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were conducted using Fisher’s Exact Tests and the weight01 algorithm to test for enrichment implemented in the R package topGO (Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer, 2019). For a more targeted analysis of M1 and M2 specific genes, we identified a set of DEGs in our data set that were previously found to be involved in monocyte polarization (FANTOM consortium et al., 2014) (638 proinflammatory and 138 regulatory), which we used to explore monocyte polarization in the current study.",b021255d-d3f9-450b-81d2-af7763dc57e4
8,methods8," We calculated the proportion of genes more highly expressed in the Mediterranean- and Western-fed animals in each polarization category and tested for significance using a permutation test (n = 100,000 permutations). To compare the DEGs identified to genes implicated in human health, we utilized gene sets associated with 103 complex human traits and diseases identified by a prior study . Fisher’s Exact Tests were used to test for enrichment of these gene sets in our Western or Mediterranean DEGs.  Transcription factor binding site analysis  We tested for enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs within 2 kb (upstream or downstream) of the transcription start sites of differentially expressed ‘Western genes’ or ‘Mediterranean genes’ (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) using the program HOMER  and equivalent regions around the transcription start sites of all genes expressed in these data as the background set for enrichment testing.",b1ffb52e-3e13-4535-b005-ed3479293421
9,methods9," We searched for known vertebrate transcription factor binding motifs and report the TF motifs passing a threshold of false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05.  Gene-gene co-expression analysis  In addition to testing whether diet led to mean differences in gene expression between Western and Mediterranean animals, we also tested whether diet impacted the correlation structure among expressed genes (i.e. gene co-expression). Specifically, we employed ‘correlation by individual level product’ (CILP)  analyses to test whether diet affected the magnitude or direction of pairwise gene expression correlations among the top 140 DEGs (n = 9730 gene-gene pairs tested). To test whether a given pair of genes was differentially co-expressed as a function of diet, we first obtained a vector of products for each gene pair by multiplying the normalized gene expression values for two genes together.",96fafd47-2152-411d-933a-2a6ca4ddee45
10,methods10," Normalization was performed by scaling expression values to mean 0 and unit variance within Mediterranean and Western subsets of the data respectively, to ensure that distributional differences between sample groups did not bias our results, following the CILP authors’ recommendations . Each of these vectors of products were used as the outcome variable in a linear mixed effects model implemented in the R package EMMREML (Akdemir and Godfrey, 2015), which included a fixed effect of diet and a random effect to control for genetic relatedness. To assess significance, we extracted the p-value associated with the diet effect for all 9730 gene pairs. We then repeated each linear mixed effects model 100 times after permuting diet, extracted the p-value associated with the diet effect, and used these values to calculate an empirical false discovery rate (FDR) distribution (Snyder-Mackler et al., 2016).",3a744f23-000e-4d09-b868-30dac09a0c22
11,methods11,"  Using this approach, we identified 445 gene pairs that were significantly differentially co-expressed as a function of diet at a 20% empirical false discovery rate (FDR). Next, we performed two follow-up analyses to understand their biological import. First, we tested for the existence of ‘hub genes’, defined as genes that displayed differential co-expression to their tested partner genes more so than expected by chance. To define the null distribution for identifying hub genes, we randomly sampled 445 gene pairs from the set of all 9730 tested gene pairs 1000 times and calculated the number of partners a focal gene had in each sample; we considered a gene to be a significant ‘hub gene’ if it fell outside the 95th percentile of this distribution, which was equivalent to a focal gene that displayed significant differential co-expression with 13 or more of its tested partner genes.",e9ce236f-0392-42b6-b3e2-0402d8ba748c
12,methods12," Second, we asked whether the set of ‘hub genes’ we identified were enriched for transcription factors, relative to the background set of all 140 genes tested for differential co-expression. We performed this analysis because many of the proposed mechanisms to generate large scale changes in gene co-expression patterns involve changes in transcription factor function or activity (de la Fuente, 2010; Gaiteri et al., 2014). To implement the enrichment analysis, we used the TRRUST database of known mammalian transcription factors for annotation  paired with hypergeometric tests.  Weighted gene co-expression network analysis  We employed the commonly used approach of weighted gene co-expression network analysis (weighted gene co expression network analysis (WGCNA)) to identify and characterize modules of co-expressed genes.",75d39b1e-0467-4121-a0c5-7aa40bb7de95
13,methods13," We used the weighted gene co expression network analysis (WGCNA) R package (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008) with a minimum module size of 30 genes and minimum module dissimilarity threshold of 0.25 to identify co-expression modules, which were then used for downstream analyses.  Mediation analysis  To explore relationships between DAB score and differential gene expression, we conducted mediation analyses using a bootstrapping approach involving 10,000 bootstrap iterations of two models: (Model 1) the expression of each gene as a function of diet, and (Model 2) the expression of each gene as a function of diet and DAB score (Preacher and Hayes, 2004). For each bootstrap iteration, we then calculated the mediation effect (i.e. the indirect effect) of DAB score as the difference between the effect size of diet in Model 1 (βdiet) and Model 2 (β’diet). We considered there to be a mediation effect when the 90% confidence interval for the indirect effect (βdiet-β’diet) did not include zero.",ac62dc62-e659-4e2c-8783-07292c8944e6

16,results0," Diet intervention  Adult female cynomolgus macaques were fed either a Western-like (hereafter, ‘Western’, n = 20) or a Mediterranean-like (hereafter, ‘Mediterranean’, n = 15) diet for 15 months (approximately equivalent to four human years). The experimental diets were formulated to model human diet patterns and have been previously described . Briefly, the Western diet was designed to mimic the diet typically consumed by middle-aged Americans (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2014), whereas the Mediterranean diet reflected key aspects of the human Mediterranean diet . The experimental diets were matched on macronutrients and cholesterol content but differed in fatty acids. Fats and proteins were mostly plant based in the Mediterranean diet , and from animal sources in the Western diet.",fe906eaf-d495-468c-a5f0-11880740f0fb

The Mediterranean diet was higher in complex carbohydrates and fiber, and had a lower n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio (similar to a modern-day, traditional hunter-gatherer type of diet [Cordain et al., 2005]), and lower sodium and refined sugars than the Western diet. Key Mediterranean ingredients included English walnut powder and extra-virgin olive oil which were the primary components provided to participants in the PREDIMED trial .

Diet induced major shifts in monocyte gene expression  RNA sequencing was employed to measure genome-wide gene expression of purified CD14+ monocytes after 15 months on the experimental diets. Diet had a strong effect on monocyte gene expression: the first principal component of the correlation matrix of normalized residual gene expression (see Materials and methods), which explained 59% of the overall variance, was significantly associated with diet (t(25.1) = 4.4, p = 1.7 x 10−4; Figure 1A). PC1 score was correlated with expression of known proinflammatory genes such as interleukin-6 (IL6 Pearson’s r = 0.77, p = 5.4 x 10−8), interleukin-1α (IL1A Pearson’s r = 0.69, p = 4.3 x 10−6), and two subunits of the NF-κB protein (NFKB1 Pearson’s r = 0.61, p = 1.2 x 10−4; NFKB2 Pearson’s r = 0.72, p = 1.3 x 10−6).",d3a326d0-502f-4359-9542-e2d7ea415379

While balanced in direction, the effect sizes of diet in Western genes were, on average, 1.6-fold larger than in Mediterranean genes (Mann-Whitney U = 4.1 x 106, p = 6.1 x 10−117; Figure 1B). Thus, the strongest effects were observed in genes that were either activated by a Western diet or suppressed by a Mediterranean diet.  Figure 1.",1a1717b2-de74-4475-b425-9b6e15e0da5b

Conversely, Mediterranean diet monocyte expression patterns were involved in enhanced oxidation-reduction processes (GO:0055114, weighted Fisher’s Exact Test (FET) p = 6.0 x 10−3), a critical function in keeping proinflammatory monocytes in check (for all GO terms enriched in Western and Mediterranean genes, see Supplementary file 1A-B).

In contrast, Mediterranean genes were not enriched for any of the 103 complex traits tested (all false discovery rate (FDR) > 0.2).  We next conducted a more targeted analysis of monocyte polarization by focusing on genes previously shown to be differentially expressed between induced proinflammatory (M1) and regulatory (M2) monocytes (FANTOM consortium et al., 2014) (see Supplementary file 1A for polarization categories).",2c00f858-ef43-4fbf-af96-ec686c685769

Association of transcription factors with differentially expressed genes  To identify putative upstream gene regulatory mechanisms, we examined whether DEGs were associated with predicted cis-regulatory transcription factor binding sites. We identified 34 distinct transcription factor-binding motifs enriched within 2 kilobases of the transcription start sites of Mediterranean genes and one that was enriched near the transcription start sites of Western genes (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.",454478fb-c2b0-4490-8978-176bd8e8b4f4
26,results11,"05; Figure 2, for all transcription factor binding motifs enriched in the regulatory regions of either set of diet genes, see Supplementary file 1). Diet altered expression of the genes encoding for seven of these 35 transcription factors, including interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)8, myocyte specific enhancer factor (MEF)2C, and SP1, which drive monocyte fate and polarization in response to extracellular signals (Chistiakov et al., 2018; Günthner and Anders, 2013; Schüler et al., 2008; Scott et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 1994). Thus, some of the diet-associated changes in monocyte transcriptional profiles may be mediated by changes in the expression and cis-regulatory binding of these key transcription factors.  Figure 2.

Gene co-expression modules recapitulate functional role of diet-induced changes  We employed a commonly used bioinformatic approach, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (weighted gene co expression network analysis (WGCNA)) (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008) to group genes by pattern of transcription into co-expression modules. Overall, we identified 15 modules of co-expressed genes.

A third module that trended toward higher expression in the Western diet, module 9 (t(32.2)=2.5, raw p = 0.019, pHB = 0.19), was enriched for genes involved in the inflammatory response (GO:0006954, weighted Fisher’s Exact Test (FET) p = 2.4 x 10−6). Together, these results reinforce our findings that the Western diet contributes to proinflammatory polarization in a multi-faceted manner, while the Mediterranean diet can contribute to the reduction of oxidative stress. Interestingly, two modules, modules 4 and 12, were depleted for diet-associated genes (module 4: Fisher’s Exact Test (FET) p = 2.1 x 10−17, module 12: Fisher’s Exact Test (FET) p = 3.9 x 10−19) and were enriched for genes involved in the defense response to virus (module 4: GO:0051607, weighted Fisher’s Exact Test (FET) p = 1.1 x 10−18) and the adaptive immune response (module 12: GO:0002250, weighted Fisher’s Exact Test (FET) p = 8.1 x 10−9).",3431a778-66c9-4a04-a9ee-f1ab2125aa55
30,results15," This suggests that viral responses and adaptive immunity may be less affected by the diet.  Diet altered gene co-expression patterns  The effects of diet on the magnitude and direction of pairwise gene expression correlations were assessed for the most strongly diet-affected genes, as such effects could reveal key gene regulatory networks that are altered by diet, that may themselves be regulated by key upstream targets (de la Fuente, 2010; Gaiteri et al., 2014). To reduce the number of tests, we limited our analyses to the pairwise combinations of the top 140 DEGs (n = 9730 combinations). Of these gene pairs, many were significantly associated with each other in both diets, both positively (n = 714) and negatively (n = 332, p < 0.05; for all gene pairs tested and their correlations, see Supplementary file 1—5A), suggesting that while diet altered expression of these genes, it did not change their co-expression relationships.",992e916e-27e9-4900-a9e6-49aa706f23eb

33,results18,"  We also identified 16 ‘hub’ genes that exhibited differential correlations with more partner genes than expected by chance (Figure 3B, for all genes included in one or more differentially correlated gene pairs, see Supplementary file 1—5B). These hub genes were enriched for genes encoding transcription factors (OR = 7.40, Fisher’s Exact Test (FET) p = 7.0 x 10−3), including SOX4 (essential for normal insulin secretion and glucose tolerance) and NR4A2 (involved in lipid, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism Goldsworthy et al., 2008; Pearen and Muscat, 2010), providing further support for immunological and metabolic reprogramming induced by our diet manipulation. Interestingly, the hub gene involved in the greatest number of differentially-correlated gene pairs was RF00283, aka SCARNA18, a non-coding RNA that has been associated with BMI, HDL cholesterol, and aging in human genome-wide association studies (Davis et al., 2017; Dluzen et al., 2018; Kanai et al., 2018; Tachmazidou et al.",0e1c6459-a0fa-4a0d-83c3-c2d19e2950f3

Diet altered social and affective behavior  In order to understand how diet may impact behavior and how both may interact to impact health, behavioral data were collected weekly during two 10 min focal observations. These data were collected during both the baseline (2 hr/monkey total) and experimental phases (mean = 17.6 hr/monkey total) of the study. There were no significant differences in behavior between assigned diet groups during the baseline phase while consuming chow (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B). However, after 15 months on experimental diets, the two diet groups differed significantly in behavior. The Mediterranean group spent more time in body contact (Mann-Whitney U = 284, Holm-Bonferroni-adjusted p (pHB) = 1.1 x 10−5) and resting (U = 269, pHB = 1.",6d6d557b-c7e8-4aeb-891f-9debced72ba1

Figure 4. Diet alters behavioral phenotype.  (A) Three behaviors were significantly different between the two diet groups.

No other principal component of behavioral phenotypes was significantly correlated with diet (Figure 4B). PC2 captured socially relevant behaviors that also differed between the diets and thus represents a composite of diet-altered behaviors (hereafter DAB). Specifically, DAB score (i.e. an individual’s PC2 projection) was positively correlated with percent of time spent in body contact, indicative of social integration (Pearson’s r = 0.89, pHB = 1.0 x 10−11; Figure 4D), and higher in Mediterranean-fed animals.

Previous work has validated a behavioral index of anxiety in nonhuman primates (rate of self-grooming and scratching) (Coleman et al., 2011; Maestripieri et al., 1992; Schino et al., 1996; Shively et al., 2015; Troisi et al., 2000; Troisi, 2002), which loaded heavily onto PC2 and is significantly negatively correlated with DAB score (Pearson’s r = −0.53, pHB = 0.019). Thus, PC2 (DAB) captured a measure of social integration associated with consuming a Mediterranean-like diet, and social isolation and anxiety associated with consuming a Western-like diet.  Diet-altered behaviors and monocyte gene expression as mediators  Given the effects of diet on both behavior and gene expression, we used mediation analyses to explore the potential influences of one on the other. Of the 4900 DEGs, 29% were also significantly associated with the DAB score in a univariate model (n = 1,414, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05).",103c56e0-f795-4dcc-a313-f3e30f4b11fd
40,results25," Of these, DAB score significantly mediated the effect of diet on the expression of 1199 genes (24% of all DEGs, p < 0.05; Figure 5A). Among these DAB-mediated genes, DAB score mediation accounted for significantly more of the total effect of diet in Western genes (mean = 52.6%, s.d. = 12.6%), than Mediterranean genes (mean = 45.3%, s.d. = 10.1%; Mann-Whitney U = 1.1 x 105, p = 6.4 x 10−25; Figure 5B).

Western diet induced a mosaic response  Western diet induced substantial variation in multiple phenotypes, including body weight, gene expression, and behavior; consistent with previous studies demonstrating that some individuals may be more resistant (or susceptible) to the effects of a Western diet , presumably due to genetic variation or past environmental exposures. However, we were unable to identify consistencies in individual responsiveness across the phenotypes (Appendix 2—figure 1).",363b556f-9b3a-4f35-8754-1eb21d4fc9d6
45,results30," For instance, monkeys that exhibited a strong gene regulatory response to the Western diet did not necessarily exhibit a large increase in body weight or a strong negative DAB score (all p > 0.2). Furthermore, change in body weight did not significantly predict gene expression in monocytes (all false discovery rate (FDR) > 0.2). Western diet fed individuals thus exhibited a mosaic response to diet across multiple phenotypes, presumably involving interactions between diet, stress, behavior, environment, microbiome, and genome/epigenome.

46,discussion0," This study shows, for the first time, that a whole-diet manipulation exerted profound effects on monocyte polarization and social behavior in primates. Forty percent of monocyte-expressed genes were differentially expressed between monkeys fed Western or Mediterranean diets, indicating that diet dramatically altered monocyte programming. Relative to monocytes from Mediterranean-fed subjects, monocytes from Western diet consumers exhibited increased expression of proinflammatory and monocyte polarization regulatory genes. Our findings extend previous studies, such as a randomized human cross-over trial that demonstrated changes in monocyte proinflammatory genes, including IL6, other interleukins, and NF-κB components, in elderly individuals consuming a Mediterranean like diet enriched in olive oil versus a diet more enriched in saturated fat .",141cedcd-2399-4ec2-ad2b-54af310d7814
47,discussion1,"  We identified a putative molecular mechanism, altered monocyte polarization, that may contribute to the established links between changes in human diets associated with industrialization and increases in chronic disease (Cordain et al., 2005; Drake et al., 2018; Jacka et al., 2010; Lea et al., 2020; Manzel et al., 2014; Pontzer et al., 2018; Smil, 1989; Smyth and Heron, 2006). Comparative studies of human health across different modern populations – namely those consuming traditional hunter-gatherer, forager-horticulturalist, or pastoralist diets versus modern, Western-like diets – lend support for the evolutionary mismatch hypothesis (Eaton et al., 1988; Kaplan et al., 2017; Lea et al., 2020; Pontzer et al., 2018).",d4aacd82-892c-42d8-9aa2-2f7a2c12ed59
48,discussion2," In particular, this work has found that traditional populations have much lower rates of non-communicable diseases, especially cardiometabolic diseases, relative to Western societies; however, because so many lifestyle factors differ between traditional societies and those in Western, high income countries, it has been difficult to understand the role of diet specifically in driving health variation or to address causality (Snodgrass, 2013; Kraft et al., 2018; Lagranja et al., 2015). Additionally, it is difficult to collect samples appropriate for genomic analyses from subsistence-level groups, and consequently the molecular correlates of industrial transitions and evolutionary mismatch remain largely unexplored. Our preclinical randomized study design allows us to draw causal inferences about the role of Western diets in the development of chronic diseases of aging, and provides important data about cellular and molecular mechanisms that may contribute to evolutionary mismatch.",9b29e473-f9b3-41bb-9a7f-0c7ad497211f
49,discussion3," These data set the stage for future studies that could compare the transcriptional response to diet in our preclinical study with gene regulatory variation observed between traditional and more market-integrated or Western-like human groups.  Beyond changes in gene expression, we also identified differences in gene co-expression and enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs, suggesting that diet exerts differential effects on gene regulatory networks. Many transcription factors appear to be involved in diet-regulated gene expression. Members of the E26 transformation-specific (E26 transformation specific (ETS)), specificity protein (Sp)/Krüppel-like family (KLF), myocyte-specific enhancer factor (myocyte specific enhancer factor (MEF)), and interferon-regulatory factor (interferon regulatory factor (IRF)) families of transcription factors, which have all been linked to myeloid differentiation (Chistiakov et al., 2018; Schüler et al., 2008; Scott et al., 1994; Zhang et al.",565f0285-6810-4360-b815-a5925cc55a6a
50,discussion4,", 1994), were overrepresented in regulatory regions of genes with higher expression in the Mediterranean diet group (‘Mediterranean genes’). Three interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family transcription factors had binding motifs enriched in Mediterranean genes: interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-8 are both linked to M1 monocyte polarization, while interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 is associated with M2 polarization. The sole transcription factor with binding sites enriched in Western diet-associated genes, ATF2, is a key mediator of inflammatory pathways and diseases, including response to bacterial endotoxin, atherosclerosis, and obesity (Fledderus et al., 2007; Miyata et al., 2012; Reimold et al., 2001). Western genes were enriched for activation of the MAPKK pathway, which lies upstream of ATF2 (Herlaar and Brown, 1999), supporting a role in monocyte polarization.",158b8e89-ec5d-4379-bd84-4a275f64ff57
51,discussion5," Transcription factors were also overrepresented in the pairs of differentially co-expressed genes, further indicating that diet alters regulatory networks and monocyte differentiation and polarization.  It is also worth pointing out that changes in gene co-expression and network connectivity have been previously proposed as a response to novel or challenging environmental conditions, including Western diets. In particular, work on decanalization has hypothesized that gene regulatory networks evolve over many generations of stabilizing selection, and that novel environmental challenges (such as Western diets and lifestyles) may disrupt these fine-tuned connections leading to dysregulation, a breakdown in co-expression, and ultimately disease (Careau et al., 2014; Gibson, 2009a; Gibson, 2009b; Hu et al., 2016; Lea et al., 2019).",65fa009f-bf86-4e52-ba75-9cf0c6eee8ee
52,discussion6," In support of this idea, we found diet-induced changes in the co-expression of transcription factors involved in insulin secretion and glucose tolerance (SOX4), lipid, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism (NR4A2), and BMI, HDL, and aging (RF00283) (Davis et al., 2017; Dluzen et al., 2018; Goldsworthy et al., 2008; Kanai et al., 2018; Pearen and Muscat, 2010). We also observed that the transcription factor myocyte specific enhancer factor (MEF)2D, which has previously been implicated in the transcriptomic response to insulin signaling (Samson and Wong, 2002; Solomon et al., 2008), is a hub gene identified in 22 differentially-correlated gene pairs. Hub genes like myocyte specific enhancer factor (MEF)2D may pinpoint optimized systems that break down as a result of mismatch and are thus intriguing targets for future analyses.  It is worth noting that the dichotomous M1/M2 paradigm of monocyte polarization is an oversimplification of the more complex heterogeneity of monocytes.",4f4992ba-49d8-45af-a810-147a632f8977
53,discussion7," (Martinez and Gordon, 2014; Nahrendorf and Swirski, 2016) For example, there are at least three classes of monocytes in the circulation–classical, intermediate, and non-classical. We did not assess the relative abundance of these subsets, thus the observed gene expression patterns could reflect either changes in the relative proportions of these subsets and/or shifts in monocyte polarization within subsets .  The diets also altered key behaviors. Monkeys consuming the Western diet exhibited more behaviors related to anxiety and social isolation, a phenotype remarkably similar to that observed in juvenile Japanese macaques born to mothers consuming a high-fat Western diet . In that study, offspring behavior was associated with maternal levels of macrophage-derived chemokine (macrophage derived chemokine (MDC)), which showed higher expression in Western-diet fed animals in our study (βdiet = 0.",d4eb4845-d26f-4bb8-baa0-0d1685eb9d45
54,discussion8,"243, false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.059). Our findings suggest that a Western diet may also exert similar behavioral effects when consumed during adulthood.  There are myriad pathways through which diet may affect behavior. Diet may induce changes in the central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)) by altering gut microbiota which alters vagal input to the brain . Previous results from our study demonstrated a strong diet effect on the gut microbiome (Nagpal et al., 2018a), and lower parasympathetic (vagal) activity in the Western diet group at the time the monocyte transcriptome was assessed . Taken together these observations suggest that diet-induced changes in vagal tone in the gut-brain axis may be one pathway through which diet impacted brain function, potentially affecting behavior.  Diet-altered behaviors were linked to changes in monocyte gene expression.",db76cff1-3f9b-4008-ab3d-a4c5c2e1ff77
55,discussion9," For a subset (24%) of genes, the DAB score mediated the effect of diet on monocyte gene expression. Monocytes have been shown to be responsive to social isolation (Cole, 2019) and anxiety . Social isolation and anxiety, produced by Western diet consumption, may be accompanied by increased sympathetic outflow and increased hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal production of cortisol, both of which modulate monocyte intracellular processes governing inflammatory molecule production (Cacioppo et al., 2015; Holwerda et al., 2018; Juruena et al., 2020). Supporting the involvement of these systems, we previously reported that the Western diet group had increased sympathetic activity, and increased cortisol concentrations . Western diet may contribute to inflammation by producing a more socially isolated or anxious animal with increased sympathetic and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal activity, which in turn alters monocyte function.",254759ff-4031-4446-928d-0486315f5fb6
56,discussion10," Higher expression of genes in the conserved transcriptional response to adversity support this pathway (Cole, 2019; Cole et al., 2015; Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Behavior is a functional assay for the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, this observation suggests that diet may alter central nervous system (CNS) function, which may in turn alter circulating monocyte gene expression.  In a somewhat smaller and overlapping subset of genes (18%), diet-induced differences in monocyte gene expression significantly mediated the effect of diet on behavior (DAB). This observation suggests that diet alters monocyte gene expression, which in turn may affect central nervous system (CNS) function. There are a variety of mechanisms through which diets differentially influence the nervous system. Western diet may disrupt the blood-brain barrier, increasing infiltration of Western-diet induced cytokines, chemokines, and myeloid cells from the periphery .",8b887df6-a101-4352-87a2-d6542a40f4ce
57,discussion11," Once in the brain these molecules can alter BDNF production, neurotransmitter systems, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function . Western diet induced inflammatory molecules also may affect the brain through direct effects on the afferent vagus nerve (Maier and Watkins, 1998), activation of glial cells , or alteration of neuronal membrane lipid composition affecting neurotransmission , whereas a Mediterranean diet may have direct anti-inflammatory actions by increasing n-3 fatty acids in the brain .  Together, these results support both mediation pathways, suggesting that multiple mechanistic pathways may contribute to these observations; however, we are unable to conclusively state that one mediation pathway is supported over the other or delineate the exact role of the central nervous system (CNS).",bea9339b-5be9-45f2-9822-4031f9ca033d
58,discussion12," As each gene is modeled independently in the mediation analyses, it is possible that the expression of a subset of genes in monocytes alters central nervous system (CNS) function and induces behavioral change, while expression of another subset of genes is responsive to behavioral phenotypes and/or central nervous system (CNS) function. These potential pathways present intriguing possibilities for future experiments.  Monkeys fed the Western diet displayed a heterogeneous response to the diet manipulation across physiological (e.g. body weight), gene regulatory, and behavioral measures. Rather than a single pattern of response to diet where the physiological changes are predictive of behavioral or gene regulatory changes in response to diet, there was no correlation between these measures in monkeys fed the Western diet. This suggests that physiological changes such as weight gain may not be the primary link between diet, poor immune function, and negative health consequences.",b5e4ea32-3d46-44c7-8aaa-8b6b0096899c

60,discussion14," In a publication based on the same study animals, dietary manipulation produced changes in the gut microbiome similar to that seen in humans consuming Western and Mediterranean diets (Nagpal et al., 2018b), which further supports the translational relevance of our findings with diet-induced changes in gene expression in genes involved in human health and disease. Nevertheless, extrapolation of the current findings to human health should be done with caution, as the last common ancestor of humans and macaques lived 25 million years ago and evolution has shaped the physiology and natural diet of each species in distinct ways . A related complication is the difficulty in defining a ‘control’ diet for both human and nonhuman primates. Macaques in the wild are omnivorous, and standard monkey chow derives most of its protein content from soy, which is rich in isoflavones such as genistein and daidzein known to have biological activity (Zaheer and Humayoun Akhtar, 2017).",eab4674d-b09a-430f-bc39-13c34e1f0e21
61,discussion15," Thus, in the context of the evolutionary mismatch hypothesis, standard monkey chow does not recapitulate a natural macaque diet that could serve as a control for the current diet manipulation, leaving the interpretation of the current results ambiguous as to which diet is driving the changes observed in one diet group relative to the other, which could be addressed in future studies.  In summary, we found that diet significantly alters monocyte polarization and gene expression, and to a lesser extent behavior. The Western diet promoted a proinflammatory monocyte phenotype relative to a Mediterranean diet, which supports the role of monocyte polarization in diet-associated chronic inflammatory diseases. Thus, altered monocyte programming could represent one mechanism underlying an evolutionary mismatch between our past and current diets.",e4307e20-ac4a-4342-b6e1-bbfcc04d9438
62,discussion16," The majority of the effects of diet are presumably mediated through direct or combined actions of saturated/polyunsaturated fats, n-6:n-3 ratios, pro- and anti-antioxidant characteristics, and other features of the Western diet inconsistent with the nutritional environment in which humans and nonhuman primates evolved. Ongoing and future work will address interactions between social behavior (e.g. social status) and diet to further understand how environmental stressors may impact inflammation in the periphery and in the central nervous system.
