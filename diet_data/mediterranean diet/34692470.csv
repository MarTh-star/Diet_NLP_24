1,methods1," The central location of our hospital and its relatively large reference healthcare population of around 445,000 implied that our study sample could adequately represent the population living in our country.  Figure 1 shows the CONSORT 2010 flowchart of our study population. From January 2015 to November 2017, a total of 2418 women who attended their first gestational visit (at 8 ± 2 gestational weeks (GW), in which the first ultrasound is performed and analytical screening for chromosomal alterations is carried out), with fasting plasma glucose (fasting plasma glucose (FPG)) < 92 mg/dL, were assessed for the clinical trial. Inclusion criteria were ≥18 years old, singleton gestation, and willingness to participate in the study.",f39d95af-651d-4574-a95c-d0cad1e4126d
2,methods2," Exclusion criteria comprised gestational age at entry >14 weeks, pre-gestational diabetes, diseases affecting carbohydrate metabolism, intolerance to nuts or extra-virgin olive oil (extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)), and medical conditions or pharmacological therapy that could compromise the effect of the intervention and/or the follow-up program. All patients included signed a written informed consent.  Figure 1 Flow diagram of women included in our study.  A sample of 1000 women was selected and randomly divided into two groups of the same size, control group (CG) and intervention group (IG), according to two nutritional intervention models. The same basic MedDiet and daily exercise habits were recommended for both groups. Participants allocated to IG received lifestyle guidance from dieticians one week after inclusion in a unique 1-hour group session.",0e13a9cf-3142-478b-b1d1-5fe54e75fee4
3,methods3," The key IG recommendation was a daily consumption of at least 40 mL of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and a handful (25-30g) of pistachios. To ensure the consumption of the minimum amount recommended, women were provided with 20 L of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and 4 Kg of roasted pistachios. Women in the CG were advised by midwives to restrict consumption of dietary fat, including extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts. These recommendations are provided in local antenatal clinics as part of the available guidelines in pregnancy standard care (5). The first women was included on January 2nd, 2015 and the last one was included on December 27th, 2015. The follow up until delivery on July 2016. The study was completed by 874 women (440/434, CG/IG). This group is the initial sub-cohort of this paper.",6a28d93e-c3db-49e9-9221-5c58d4921c0d
4,methods4,"  The aforementioned randomized controlled trial (RCT) concluded that an early nutritional intervention with a supplemented MedDiet reduces the incidence of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (3). Based on these results, our hospital recommended the adoption of this nutritional intervention (i.e., MedDiet enriched with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts), without providing these specific products, to all pregnant women, from the beginning of gestation, in real word (4). Thus, from November 2016 onwards, every pregnant woman who attended the first gestational visit were invited to participate in our study based on the implementation of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) results in clinical practice. The last women included on November 30, 2017 was follow up until delivery on July 2018. In accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria indicated above, a new sub-cohort (real-world group, RW) was defined, with 768 samples that are included in this study.",c89ac334-5378-4219-8326-057e77e61e99

6,methods7,"  Diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus  A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with 75-g glucose was performed at 24-28 weeks of gestation. fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were determined by the glucose oxidase method in fresh plasma samples. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG)) criteria were used for the diagnosis of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (2).  Genotype analysis  Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA-stabilized blood samples taken during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using the Maxwell RSC instrument (Promega, Dubendorf, Switzerland).  Genotyping was performed by IPLEX MassARRAY PCR using the Agena platform (Agena Bioscience, SanDiego, CA). IPLEX MassARRAY PCR and extension primers were designed from sequences containing each target SNP and 150 upstream and downstream bases with AssayDesign Suite (http://agenabio.",fdf86863-6827-47ed-937a-fe85be5098d8

Single base extension reactions were performed on the PCR reactions with the iPLEX Gold Kit (AgenaBioscience) and 0.8µl of the custom UEP pool. The kit contains mass modified terminator nucleotides that increase the mass difference between extended UEPs, allowing for greater accuracy in genotyping. The mass difference with unmodified terminator nucleotides ranges from 9 to 40 kDa, depending on the two nucleotides compared. With the mass-modified terminator nucleotides the mass difference increases to 16–80 kDa. The single base extension reactions were cycled with a nested PCR protocol that used five cycles of annealing and extension nested with a denaturation step in a cycle that was repeated 40 times for a total of 200 annealing and extension steps. The goal was to extend nearly all of the UEPs. Following single base extension, the reactions were diluted with 16µl of water and deionized with 6 ng of resin.",53dca4da-647b-4a83-adc1-22ae157c18be
8,methods9," After deionizing for 20 min the reactions were dispensed onto SpectroChipArrays with a Nanodispenser (Agena Bioscience). The speed of dispensation was optimized to deliver an average of 20 nl of each reaction to a matrix pad on the SpectroChip. An Agena Bioscience Compact MassArray Spectrometer was used to perform MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry according to the iPLEX Gold Application Guide. The Typer 4 software package (Agena Bioscience) was used to analyze the resulting spectra and the composition of the target bases was determined from the mass of each extended oligo. These panels were designed in collaboration with PATIA and Genotyping was performed at the Agena platform located at the Epigenetics and Genotyping laboratory, Central Unit for Research in Medicine (Unit for Research in Medicine (UCIM)), Faculty of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain.  Selection of SNPs  The 110 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were based on literature references (6–12).",f7d050d0-f4fe-4312-9473-abee18e54654
9,methods10," Specifically, SNPs were prioritized according to the results of large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (genome wide association studies (GWAS)) performed in European and other populations, and with the presumption that their effects can be extrapolated and generalized, and that large sample sizes allow solid estimations of the true size effect. Allele frequencies were considered to maximize the SNPs’ predictive power (effect size x allele frequency). In addition, significant SNPs identified in smaller association studies were also included. As a result, the selected SNPs for analysis fulfilled the following criteria: odds ratio (OR) >1.2, Rare Allele Frequency (Rare Allele Frequency (RAF)) >0.20 and Association Statistical Significance of p <1 × 10-5 ( Supplementary Table 1 ).",8adf1fcd-ac18-4cd4-8e4f-d3a3a1e718a4
10,methods11,"  GWA quality control  Quality control steps removed participants with a high missing genotype rate (MIND >5%, 13 samples), removed SNPs with a high missing genotype data (GENO > 5%, 1 variant), removed SNPs due to Hardy-Weinberg exact test (HWE, p < 1 × 10−6, 7 variants), and removed SNPs due to allele low frequency threshold (MAF < 5%, 4 variants). As a result, our data warehouse included 1573 women and 98 SNPs, with a total genotyping rate of 0.996544 ( Supplementary Table 1 ). ",e0f1b1db-6dfb-479a-80f7-e2fc46f2f584
11,analysis0," Statistical analyses regarding patients’ characteristics were performed in SPSS (Chicago, IL, USA) version 24.0. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or median and interquartile range according to the normality of their distribution. χ2 test was used to compare qualitative characteristics and quantitative characteristics were assessed with Student’s t-test. A two-sided p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  The association between each SNP and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk was evaluated by genetic binary logistic regression models. All genetic association tests were performed using PLINK v.1.9 and 2.0 software (13). Specifically, we used the following models and tests: ADDITIVE model – test ADD; DOMINANT model – test DOM; RECESSIVE model – test REC and HETHOM model -test HOM and HET.  In all the logistic regression models, a variable was added to represent the nutritional intervention group [GROUP].",93f02c43-3785-4d17-89ba-c7ad9ae9b2ed
12,analysis1," We defined this variable with values 1, 2 and 3 corresponding respectively to the CG, IF and RW groups of Figure 1 . The reference group for the logistic regression model was the CG group.  The analysis was carried out by stratifying the sample by ethnicity, according to the two categories present in the data: Caucasian (Caucasian (CAU)) and Hispanic (Hispanic (HIS)). The allele indicated in the previous literature was taken as the reference allele (reference allele (REF)). In the logistic regression models, the minor allele (A1) was always taken as the base category, meaning that it can be a risk allele when OR > 1 or a protective allele when OR < 1. For each test of a model, the corresponding p-value was obtained using the PLINK software. As false discovery rate control (false discovery rate control (FDR)), we started with the set of p-values and then we calculated the q-values (i.e.",f36e8c25-a72a-4e65-b9b6-d2a274803b0e

As association significance criteria we used the following thresholds: p-value ≤ 0.05, q-value ≤ 0.05, lfdr-value ≤ 0.1.  Bioinformatics analysis  We mapped each SNP to its nearest corresponding protein-coding gene and then we performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and protein–protein interaction (performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and protein–protein interaction (PPI)) analysis for the set of SNPs that reached significance in any of the criteria indicated above. The analysis was performed using STRING, version 11.5 (15). ",85fc5821-83a0-4ce1-a43a-998895b4acf5

The variable of the logistic regression model that represents the nutritional group [GROUP] provided relevant information to assess the association of the genetic variants with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The analysis showed that the SNP-Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) association tests identified as significant, when adjusted by the GROUP variable, had a lower false discovery rate control (FDR), that is, the discoveries have a low proportion of false significant identified associations, evaluated by q-values, and a low local false discovery rate, evaluated by lfdr-values.",70e9f59d-36a6-40ed-8324-44db57672ec2

It is included in some studies as associated with diabetes (19, 22, 23) and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (36). In our study, it hardly reaches significance in the DOM model of the Hispanic ethnicity.  The CUBN (rs18001222), MTR (rs1805087), and SARDH (rs573904) proteins define a subnetwork in the graph that play a role in one-carbon metabolism with functions in many cellular processes.

It has also been associated with type 2 diabetes in an elderly population (44). In our work, it is in the limits of significance in the DOM and HET model in the Hispanic ethnicity. MTR, 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate–homocysteine ​​methyltransferase, catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from methyl- cobalamin to homocysteine; belongs to the vitamin-B12 dependent methionine synthase family, and has been associated with various biological processes related to pregnancy (45).

In this regard, the following works can be consulted (9, 38, 46–49):. As an example, in our study some SNPs included in the initial list of variants and clearly identified in the literature, such as TCFL2, KCNQ1, HNFA1A, SCL30A8, have not reached a level of significance in any association model with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This could be related to the complex genetic and epigenetic architecture, with both similarities and differences between diabetes and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which deserves further investigation.",e354a296-d0e4-408c-9040-2d13e00bf737
31,discussion11,"  The idea of considering the evaluation of the impact of diet and lifestyle on the significance of SNPs in their association with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is currently attracting the interest of investigators (50). In this regard, we remark that our study has been performed with a meticulous evaluation of lifestyle habits, showing the protective effect of a healthy MedDiet, and that significant SNPs remained as such, after performing a rigorous genetic and statistical bioinformatic analysis.  Conclusion  Identifying the potential susceptibility genetic variants that could be associated with developing Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and their modulation due to a nutritional intervention deems useful to design preventive and therapeutic strategies, especially in the setting of the increasing prevalence of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).",a259f45b-9325-4433-9977-61a7e0605d41
32,discussion12," In this study, we have examined a set of 98 SNPs in a large cohort of patients from two main ethnicities from a single center, and in the setting of an ongoing clearly beneficial nutritional intervention. The study confirms previous works that promote the therapeutic recommendation of Mediterranean Diet to all pregnant women to prevent Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). In addition, we have confirmed a core set of SNPs reported in the literature as associated with diabetes and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, our statistical models, that include the nutritional intervention as an additional variable, highlight and reinforce the significance of the association effects, reducing the false discovery rate control (FDR) levels. This means that a safer tool is available to control the risk of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) based on the genomic profile of the individual.",910b99a5-e48d-4334-ac48-b112447051ec
33,discussion13," Therefore, genotypic analysis of women of child-bearing age and recommending a MedDiet, will assist the prompt identification and management of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
