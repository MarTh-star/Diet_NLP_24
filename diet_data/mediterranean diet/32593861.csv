0,methods0," For this review, we searched the PubMed and InfoPsych databases using the key search terms “Mediterranean or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) and cognitive decline or cognition or Alzheimer’s or dementia”. To narrow the volume of publications, the terms “and systematic review or meta-analysis” were added. The search yielded three systematic reviews [2,30,59]. Combined, these three systematic reviews provided 140 papers that were identified from these databases: PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. An additional search performed to find relevant papers published since 2019 yielded one additional RCT [2], which is still underway.",667fe58a-eaeb-477b-8964-3c9bef0fd378

Excluded are studies on similar dietary patterns such as the Anti-Inflammatory Diet or the Prudent Healthy Diet because data are more limited for these [41]. From the studies that remained, 18 duplicates were eliminated, yielding a total of five RCTs and 27 observational studies. Six of the 27 observational studies included more than one dietary pattern (e.g., Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and/or Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets were compared in one paper).

Gaps and Challenges in Current Research  This paper has identified the potential ways in which neuroprotective diets may contribute to cognitive health, while recognizing that research to date has been inconsistent, and in some cases, conflicting. As examples, this paper highlights the 32 studies reviewed on the association between the Medi/Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)/Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) dietary patterns and cognition or cognitive decline. These papers cover five RCTs and 27 observational studies (Figure 1). Because some studies included more than one dietary pattern, the review includes results for a total of 40 dietary analyses.",eea605fc-19e1-44dd-b16e-fad756541916
3,methods3," Of the five RCTs, four included a Medi diet arm, with two of these reporting a positive impact between the Medi diet and cognitive health [33,34] and one reporting a null effect [60]. The fourth Medi RCT [61] reported mixed results; there were no differences between either of the two intervention groups or the control group on three measures of cognitive function. For a fourth measure, which involved the task with the greatest processing load, the two intervention groups adhering to the Medi diet did significantly worse (p < 0.001) than the control group. The fifth RCT, testing a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [62], also had mixed results. The intervention with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet alone (without exercise) showed improvement in psychomotor speed but not in executive function-memory learning.",8f818982-b424-4f54-942d-b933323b7bb6
4,methods4," Within the observational studies representing 35 analyses of Medi/Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)/Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND), there were 21 positive associations between diet and cognition, nine null findings, and five studies with mixed outcomes. Details about the RCTs and observational studies can be found in Table 3.  3.1. Challenges in Measuring Dietary Impact on Cognition  This section addresses the gaps and challenges of identifying the link between dietary patterns and cognitive change. These gaps and challenges contribute to the inconsistencies of study results to date. Some of these challenges are unique to the study of diet and cognition, and other challenges are common to any clinical trial or observational study but play a significant role in accurately assessing cognitive decline.  3.1.1.",3b7c9b7a-b0d5-43c8-9a91-64a64fd1f002
5,methods5," Dietary Intake Measures  The key to analyzing the link between neuroprotective diets and cognitive health is the accuracy of dietary intake. Inaccuracy here can lead to inconsistencies in results across studies. Common tools include food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), 24-h dietary recalls (24HRs), or food diaries. Dietary intake measures varied widely in the five RCTs we reviewed. One study used an FFQ, two studies used a combination of an FFQ and questionnaire, one study used dietary diaries, and the final RCT did not specify the dietary intake method. Within the observational studies, most (N = 23) incorporated FFQs or semi-quantitative FFQs, several (N = 3) used 24HRs, and one used food diaries.  All dietary intake tools that involve self-report have inherent limitations which contribute to inaccuracies.",38d29ddf-5ed9-4a79-8224-6efe0dc52e4f
6,methods6," For FFQs, used predominantly in large-scale epidemiologic studies, these limitations include inaccuracy related to portion size [83], lack of generalizability to multi-racial/ethnic cohorts [84], and the addition of non-standard items unique to the Medi, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), or Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets which may not exist on the FFQ and contribute to misclassification [85]. Limitations to 24HRs are the cost and logistics of the data [86] and the inability to account for day-to-day variation in diet. Limitations to food diaries include cost, logistics, and high respondent burden [86,87]. To improve the accuracy of estimated individual intake, research supports the use of a combination of tools such as the FFQ and multiple 24HRs [88].  3.1.2.",7093712c-3c89-4dfa-9600-3dfddd179626
7,methods7," Dietary Pattern Metrics  A second challenge in accurately assessing dietary intake is that multiple tools have been created for scoring adherence to the same dietary pattern. Radd-Vagenas et al. [89] identify 30 different Mediterranean Diet scoring (Mediterranean Diet scoring (MDS)) systems, and there are at least 10 different Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scoring systems [85]. The two Mediterranean Diet scoring (MDS) systems most frequently used are the original scoring system by Trichopoulou et al. [54] and an alternate by Panagiotakos et al. [90]. The Trichopoulou et al. [54] score developed in 2003 ranges from 0 (minimum adherence) to 9 (maximum adherence) based on sex-specific median intakes of nine components. The Panagiotakos et al. [90] score ranges from 0 to 55 based on 11 components. None of the four Medi RCTs reviewed here used either the original or alternate scoring system.",ee2d7cf9-bd92-48c0-b28e-94cc279c65b7
8,methods8," Two of the Medi RCTs used their own 14 item questionnaire to score adherence [33,34]. One Medi RCT created their own scoring system for an Australian population based on the food content of 15 Medi diets and the nutrient content of eight [60]. The final Medi RCT did not identify a specific Medi scoring system but instead provided participants with guidelines to increase vegetables, fruits, and oily fish, reduce dietary fat to 30% of energy, and substitute predominantly monounsaturated fats for saturated fats [61]. Within the Medi observational studies reviewed, most used the original method (N = 18), some used the alternate method (N = 5), and one study used both.  The Mediterranean Diet scoring (MDS) scoring metrics are uniquely problematic as they are typically based on median cut points for intake of food groups, which differ from one population to another [91].",115fcad2-f923-4139-9a10-83ec7888fc5f
9,methods9," For example, in Greece, the median intake of vegetables is six servings a day, and the median intake of fruits is three servings [55,91]. An individual will receive a 0 or 1 score based on whether they were below or above the median. In contrast, the US median intake of vegetables is three servings a day and the median intake of fruits is two servings [92]. This creates a floating metric of intake across studies. Because the intake of vegetables is higher in Mediterranean countries, there is the potential that studies conducted here will show more positive associations with this dietary pattern and cognitive health. In the four Medi diet RCTs we analyzed, the two conducted in Mediterranean countries showed positive results, and the two in non-Mediterranean countries showed null results. Within the Medi diet observational studies, the three conducted in Mediterranean countries showed positive results.",e4ca8e18-8984-4621-8066-4fcc3f76e559
10,methods10," Within non-Mediterranean countries, 10 had positive results, eight had null results, and three had mixed results. An additional challenge within non-Mediterranean countries is the country-specific interpretation of the traditional scoring systems. To reflect the eating pattern of Swedes, the ULSAM observational study of the Medi diet replaced monounsaturated fatty acids with polyunsaturated fatty acids, excluded nuts and seeds, and combined potatoes with whole grains, even though it used the 0–9 Mediterranean Diet scoring (MDS) scoring system [73]. Similar adjustments were made in observational studies for Chinese populations [37], Australian populations [67,68], and Nordic populations [76].  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scoring metrics also vary widely, with more than 10 being used [85], although the most common were developed by Fung et al. [56] and Folsom et al. [93]. The Fung et al.",314e3064-2d16-4896-9537-a0c84bfde012
11,methods11," [56] score is based on eight dietary components, each of which receives a score of 0 to 1 based on quintile intake, with a total score between 8–40. The Folsom et al. [93] score is based on pre-defined cut-offs of 11 components, with a total score between 0–11. Both were used in the observational studies that were analyzed (Fung et al. score N = 3, Folsom et al. score N = 1). The dietary pattern in the one RCT focused on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet did not specify either of these dietary pattern scores but measured changes according to the Healthy Eating Index [62].  In contrast to the challenges with scoring the Mediterranean diet, which is based on median intake, or the multiple scoring systems for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet is easier to score.",5c5ecebe-f58f-4f81-9c73-a64cded96c9f
12,methods12," Currently, there is only one system, and it is based on absolute vs. relative levels of intake [91]. It assigns one point for the specified consumption per day or week of 10 brain healthy foods (whole grains, leafy greens, other vegetables, berries, fish, poultry, beans, olive oil, nuts, and wine) and assigns one point for consuming less than the maximum specific portion per day or week of five unhealthy brain foods (red meat, fast/fried food, butter/margarine, cheese, and pastries/sweets [39]. The 2015 MAP observational study, Table 1 [17] provides an example of how all three dietary patterns may be scored in a single study.  3.1.3.",f4b2931e-b3d8-4502-a4d9-67dd3261f4af
13,methods13," Cognitive Assessment Measures  In the recent book published by the National Academy of Sciences, Preventing Cognitive Decline: A Way Forward, the authors identify a lack of consistent cognitive outcome measures across current and recent trials to be a major challenge in understanding the effects of lifestyle interventions such as diet on cognition, making it impossible to pool results across studies [58] (pp. 84–85). For meaningful outcomes, it is recommended that the measures used to assess cognitive decline reflect the latest diagnostic guidelines for assessing AD. However, those guidelines are shifting, and research methods have not kept pace. The Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnostic Guidelines, established more than 30 years ago [94], were updated in 2011 [95] to better assess the disease at its earliest stages. Assessment now requires a battery of tests across cognitive domains (e.g.",34c6caf5-881f-46da-9be8-03f514fe227b
14,methods14,", working memory, semantic memory, visuospatial ability, and perceptual speed) in addition to episodic memory, where the first major outward symptoms of dementia are seen [95]. In addition, the new guidelines recommend that biomarkers such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) be used in research-based studies to identify disease presence, even though an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot confirm dementia with certainty [95,96].  Within the RCTs reviewed here, four used a battery of neuropsychological tests, but the 2013 PREDIMED-NAVARRA trial [33] used only the Mini-Mental State Examination (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)) and Clock Drawing Test (Clock Drawing Test (CDT)). Both are considered crude measures of assessing cognitive decline which lack sensitivity to small changes [97] with the potential to under-report cognitive change.",06140743-1d81-4314-b14c-20bd40b8c42d
15,methods15," In addition, the 2013 PREDIMED trial failed to administer these tests at baseline, so it could only analyze cognitive function, not change in cognition, over the 6.5 years of the study [33]. Within the observational studies that were reviewed, researchers used a wide range and number of neurological assessments (N = 1–21). Similar to the RCTs, some (N = 5) used only the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) to assess cognitive change. Others used simplified measures such as the Subjective Cognitive Function (Subjective Cognitive Function (SCF)) test, with only six yes/no questions based upon participants’ perception of their current cognitive functioning [64] or the Six Item Screener, with just six questions that result in a rating of “impairment likely” or “impairment less likely” [81]. These assessments fall short in analyzing the complexity of cognitive change, making it more difficult to interpret results across studies.",861f71c4-5925-47f5-84fe-0cd59d137654
16,methods16," In contrast, a battery of neurological assessments provides a more complete picture of the effects of diet on specific cognitive functions, although a downside to testing batteries is that they often provide mixed results, leading to challenges in interpretation of overall findings. These mixed results occurred in two of the RCTs studied and four of the observational studies. Examples of commonly used tests in neuropsychological test batteries are found in Table 4. Even though biomarkers such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) are now part of the standard guidelines for diagnosing AD [95], only the PIVUS observational study in Sweden [80] used brain imaging in addition to neuropsychological tests.  3.2. Gaps Common to Clinical Trials and Observational Studies  3.2.1.",3f9e5ed4-8591-4e68-a43e-158c2a9f84e1
17,methods17," Length of Follow-Up  For a study to generate substantive findings, it must be long enough to capture at least a minimum number of events or changes in measures that involve continuous outcomes. There is no gold standard for the number of years required to measure cognitive decline, but it is difficult to detect in periods of less than a year [58] (p. 81). Within the five RCTs reviewed, three had durations of less than a year. The MedLey study (null finding) was six months [60]; the ENCORE study (mixed findings) was four months [62]; and the Wardle et al. study (mixed findings) was 12 weeks [61]. Insufficient follow-up periods lead to spurious results.  3.2.2. Attrition  A challenge in longer studies is participant attrition. The two PREDIMED-NAVARRA RCT studies [33,34] had longer follow-up periods than the three already cited (6.5 and 4.1 years, respectively).",9113ac71-dd9f-448b-aa2b-3dcab56c8df3
18,methods18," Both found a positive link between the Medi diet and cognition, although these studies suffered from a common challenge of longer trials: high attrition. Because of high drop-out rates in both studies, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality considered both to be at high risk for survivor bias [58] (p. 113).  3.2.3. Statistical Power and Sample Size  Ideally, studies are designed to detect a meaningful minimum difference (if there is one), and to provide confidence that a null finding is due to a lack of an effect when that is the true relationship, and not an error in study design (e.g., inadequate sample size, high attrition). The statistical “power” of a study is largely determined by the variance in study variables and sample size. Sample size is especially important in the study of cognitive change because the subset of participants who develop cognitive decline is relatively small and drawing conclusions from a small subset can be misleading.",72c56ccc-c07b-47d5-9cce-756edec5f9de
19,methods19," This was the challenge of the PATH Through Life observational study [65] which analyzed the impact of the Medi diet on the cognition of 1528 men for four years and found that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), combined with excessive calorie intake, were predictive of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This finding on monounsaturated fats is the oppositive of dozens of studies reporting neuroprotective benefits of MUFAs [29,33,34]. However, the conclusions of the PATH Through Life study are based on a small subset of the study population who developed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia: 10 participants were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (0.6%); 19 had a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5 (1.2%); and 37 were diagnosed with mild cognitive disorder (2.4%) [65].  4.",e3c04a62-05b8-4c63-827c-31a423f122e4
20,methods20," Beyond Study Limitations to Practical Recommendations  While past studies have limitations, it is important to learn from them and take advantage of new tools and more robust design methods so that these neuroprotective dietary patterns can be introduced to more individuals and a broader array of researchers. This section provides two distinct ways to accelerate future research through RCTs in the form of both pragmatic trials and explanatory trials.  4.1. The Role of Pragmatic Trials in the Study of Neuroprotective Diets  Clinical trials, the gold standard within the medical sciences community to test and evaluate interventions, fall into two broad categories: explanatory and pragmatic. Many trials have features of both designs [99,100]. Explanatory trials are designed to test whether an intervention works under optimal conditions (efficacy), while a pragmatic trial evaluates the effectiveness of an intervention in real-life practical conditions, such as a clinical care setting.",a5d13878-7de2-4147-affe-45254055806e
21,methods21," Explanatory trials carefully control the inclusion and exclusion criteria of participants while pragmatic trials have broader inclusion criteria that is more representative of the general population [101].  In its recommendations for public health interventions to prevent or delay cognitive impairment, the NAS identifies pragmatic trials as one of the top methodological strategies to get dementia-related interventions into broad, routine clinical practices or community settings [58] (p. 88). An example of a pragmatic trial is AgeWell.de, a WW FINGERS trial funded by the Alzheimer’s Association [100]. A major goal of the WW FINGERS research is to get interventions to as large of a population as possible in real-world settings so that they can be understood, refined, and applied by practitioners [102,103]. The AgeWell.de study is being conducted by primary care physicians within their offices and includes a wide range of older adults who are part of their physician’s general practice.",502c0c3e-8f3f-4c50-af52-dca45eff90af
22,methods22,"  4.2. New Standards in Explanatory RCTs for Neuroprotective Diets  This section provides specific recommendations for future explanatory RCTs, drawing upon an example of an RCT underway at Rush Medical Center [2]. The study is a three-year RCT designed to test the effects of the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) dietary pattern on the cognitive function of 604 men and women, 65–84 years old, cognitively unimpaired, and overweight, with suboptimal diets. Both the intervention group and control group will be prescribed mild caloric restriction for weight loss.  4.2.1. Dietary Intake Measures  Use a combination of 24HRs and FFQs. The Rush RCT [2] combines both measures and applies these at baseline and at months 6, 12, 24, and 36. This combination of both measures across all test intervals is designed to allow for more accurate intake of dietary components.",fe4cbd23-ea3c-4a28-b92d-265265d1ca4f
23,methods23," In the studies examined in this paper, the FFQs and semi-quantitative FFQs varied widely across the 32 studies reviewed in this paper. Researchers should select an FFQ that has been validated within the population to be studied. For RCTs with insufficient funding for staff administered 24-h recalls, an option is the Automated Self-Administered 24-h (ASA24®) Dietary Assessment Tool [104]. This is a free, web-based tool developed in 2009 in conjunction with the NIH. It enables multiple, automatically coded, self-administered 24-h diet recalls and/or single or multi-day food records and has been used in more than 6000 studies as of January 2020.  4.2.2. Dietary Pattern Metrics  Measure absolute rather than relative intake levels.",420f4674-2f69-4f37-a66a-8e22bddd2b42
24,methods24," There are advantages to scoring dietary patterns on an absolute intake of food, which is the norm for the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, rather than on relative cutoffs based on within population levels of intake, as in the Medi diet. Absolute intake makes it easier to interpret results across different studies because they share a common metric. It is also easier to understand when presented as servings per day [91]. All three dietary patterns discussed can be scored in absolute values vs. relative (Table 4). To pool results across studies, the servings per day should be consistent across populations, not altered for median intake.  4.2.3. Cognitive Assessment Measures  Use a neuropsychological test battery combined with a biomarker test (at least in a subset of the study population).",4d312ee4-b9bd-4966-906e-cd8115a3ed1a
25,methods25," These recommendations reflect the latest Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnostic Guidelines [95] and take advantage of new tools to measure cognitive change. A recommended tool for screening is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [37]. Compared to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), which has been cited in many of the studies reviewed here, the MoCA shows less susceptibility to both cultural and educational biases and is free for clinical use [90]. The MoCA also has the advantage of testing multiple cognitive domains with an easy and single scoring system [96]. For the neuropsychological testing, an option is the NIH Toolbox (nihtoolbox.org). This set of instruments was developed within the past decade and designed to establish a standard approach to measuring cognitive, emotional, sensory, and motor function, allowing data across research studies to be pooled.",645e14fd-d400-437f-90e2-258ad241186f
26,methods26," Additionally, at least a subset of participants should have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at the beginning and end of the intervention period to assess change in measures of total brain volume along with other measures of brain macro-and micro-structural integrity [2].  4.2.4. Length of Follow-Up  Longer is better but allow more than one year. As stated earlier, there is no gold standard for the number of years needed to assess cognitive change although various sources offer a range. The NAS acknowledges that one year is too short of a duration and recommends 5 to 10 years [58] (p. 82). A systematic review relating to change point studies on accelerated decline in cognitive and neurological outcomes found that change points related to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were 3–7 years prior to diagnosis, and change points related to AD and other forms of dementia were 1–11 years prior to diagnosis [105]. The two Medi diet RCTs with positive findings were 6.5 years and 4.",47d23ba4-eced-46be-8f06-2605b8a6f590
27,methods27,"1 years, respectively [33,34]. The Rush RCT [2] is designed to include a follow-up of more than three years, although the study authors recognize this relatively short timeframe may be a limitation.  4.2.5. Adherence  Establish measures to achieve and assess adherence. Most RCTs have questionable long-term adherence to the dietary intervention selected [106]. To address this, there are two separate components to consider: achieving adherence and assessing adherence. In many RCTs, these aspects of study design and conduct are overlooked or minimized, or adherence is confused with attending a class vs. eating the prescribed foods. The Rush RCT [2] applies a rigorous and consistent method to support dietary adherence.",c12e8c67-c5b3-4eed-b12d-b9235115075d
28,methods28," This includes an initial three- to four-week run-in period to assess compliance, combined with frequent telephone/email communications with a nutritional case manager, personalized diet plans, compliance aids including a food tracking phone app, group cooking classes and buddy systems, and frequent weight monitoring and check-ins. Assessment of adherence in that study is conducted using both FFQs and 24HRs, as described previously. These approaches are aligned with maximizing both the level of adherence achieved and the ability to report adherence achievement to allow for more effectively critical evaluation.  4.2.6. Attrition  Help participants feel valued and maximize their engagement. Selective attrition is a potential problem in longer-running RCTs (as well as longitudinal studies). If the people who continue to participate differ from their drop-out counterparts with respect to key characteristics, the remaining sample becomes less representative [107].",5357f5f9-54ac-41e1-8617-c05b16c609df
29,methods29," In cognitive studies, participants who remain are often characterized by better levels of education and health, potentially skewing the results to show less cognitive decline [108]. To minimize attrition, it is important to make all study participants feel valued as “citizen scientists” [109] and not merely research subjects. As shown in the Rush RCT [2], equal time, attention, and engagement must be given to participants in all study arms so that there is equipoise between them.  4.2.7. Statistical Power and Sample Size  Ensure the study is powered to detect the meaningful minimum difference that has been identified as the study’s primary outcome. In the Rush RCT [2], the study is powered to test the effect of the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) intervention over the control intervention based on the annual rate of change in the global cognitive score (a composite of the 12 neuropsychological tests).",745961c0-9f70-4bac-83dc-99e962ca20ea
30,methods30," Based on a sample size of 300 participants in each of the two groups, the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) trial has >85% power to detect a between-group difference of 2% in the annual rate of cognitive decline (two-sided p = 0.05) considering a possible 5% drop-out at each visit.  4.2.8. Additional Recommendations  Begin testing populations at an earlier age. A potential limitation of the Rush RCT [2] is its focus on older adults aged 65–84 years. While the study of dementia in older adults is the norm, the recommendation of the Alzheimer’s Association and the NAS is to begin studies at an earlier age, since changes in brain physiology and cognitive abilities may occur years before symptoms appear, and lifestyle interventions may have a more significant impact if started at an earlier life-stage [3,58] (pp. 81–82).",1bfb887b-88c8-4aaa-b446-b8d74117f7a2
31,methods31," The challenge of studying a younger population is that there is less cognitive decline, so these populations need to be studied for a longer duration to determine if dietary patterns have an effect.  Include the intake of anticholinergic drugs, including antihistamines, and benzodiazepines as potential confounders of study outcomes. These drugs are associated with adverse cognitive effects in older adults [110,111] and may lead to spurious results if they are not analyzed as part of the study. Only one RCT analyzed [34] included anticholinergic drugs as a potential confounder.  5. Conclusions  Alzheimer’s disease is a critical public health issue given the societal, financial, individual, and family burden. Projected numbers in the next three decades may increase beyond the current staggering estimates based on the unknown and potentially lasting effects of social isolation due to COVID-19.",80c98106-735b-4ae8-ad6d-fae133f9525c
32,methods32," The traditional pharmaceutical approach has not demonstrated a cure or reduction in symptoms over the long term, while lifestyle approaches, including dietary patterns, provide a low-risk, low-cost alternative that may dramatically change the trajectory of this disease.  More RCTs are needed so that dietary patterns with an evidence base for effectiveness can be identified and can reach a broader population more quickly. The design of future RCTs should address gaps and challenges that may have led to inconsistent study findings in the past including inaccuracy in assessing food intake, multiple dietary scoring systems, a shifting metric among studies focused on the Mediterranean diet, a lack of standards in the tools used to assess cognitive decline, and studies that were underpowered or follow-up periods that were too short to detect cognitive change.",d44cfe9d-713d-47a3-b31a-3ba0788d3cf4
33,methods33," Because lifestyle interventions such as diet may have greater impact at earlier life stages, studies should begin to include younger populations.  It is vital to accelerate the study of these neuroprotective diets through explanatory and pragmatic trials to potentially mitigate the devastating effects of a disease that is projected to affect more than 100 million people in the next 30 years.
