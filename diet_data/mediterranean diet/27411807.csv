0,methods0,"4.1. Animals Fifteen 6-month-old male Wistar rats, supplied by Harlan Ibérica (Barcelona, Spain), were used in this study. Mean body weight was 495 g at the start of the study. Rats were housed at a constant temperature (25 °C) and under constant day length (12 h). Experimental procedures for animal use and care were in accordance with European Communities Council Directive 2010/63/UE and Spanish regulation RD 53/2013, and the study was approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Jaén.  4.2. Experimental Design and Diets After reception, rats (aged 6 months) were allowed free access to water and food for 24 weeks until the end of the experiment (aged 12 months). Until reception, all rats had been fed with the same standard diet that we used for group 1. Rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 5 each). Group 1 (S) was fed a standard diet for experimental rats.",9f27fbc2-a961-4407-93c3-da6335d19c00
1,methods1," Group 2 (virgin olive oil (20%) (VOO)) was fed a diet supplemented with virgin olive oil (20%), and group 3 (BCh) was fed a diet supplemented with butter (20%) plus cholesterol (0.1%). The nutrition value and lipid profile of diets used during the experimental periods are shown in Table 2. The standard (S) diet was low in energy and high in carbohydrates compared with the virgin olive oil (20%) (VOO) and Bch diets. The virgin olive oil (virgin olive oil (20%) (VOO)) diet was high in monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) and polyphenols, and the butter plus cholesterol (Bch) diet was high in saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)) and cholesterol.  4.3. Samples After the feeding period (24 weeks), animals were perfused with saline solution through the left cardiac ventricle under equithensin anesthesia (2 mL/kg body weight); a sample of blood was previously removed and centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 g to obtain the plasma.",e9ba8d96-4433-497a-acb7-22638ee7a202
2,methods2,"  Samples from the right testis (interstitial area and seminiferous tubules) were quickly removed and frozen in dry ice. To obtain the soluble fraction, tissue samples were homogenized in 10 volumes of 10 mM HCl-Tris buffer (pH = 7.4) and ultracentrifugated at 100,000× g for 30 min (4 °C). The resulting supernatants were used to measure soluble enzymatic activity and protein content, assayed in triplicate. To solubilize membrane proteins, pellets were re-homogenized in HCl-Tris buffer (pH = 7.4) plus 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation (100,000× g, 30 min, 4 °C), supernatants were used to measure membrane-bound activity and proteins, also in triplicate. To ensure the complete recovery of activity, detergent was removed from the medium by adding adsorbent polymeric Biobeads SM-2 (100 mg/mL) (Bio-Rad, Richmond, VA, USA) to the samples, which were shaken for 2 h at 4 °C.  4.4. Biochemical Assessment 4.4.1.",e9c8b961-65f5-404f-9e86-ceeaaaca122f
3,methods3," Triglycerides and Cholesterol Assay Plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides were determined colorimetrically using a commercial kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA, 352-50). HDL cholesterol was precipitated with phosphotungstic acid and quantified using the same method. LDL and VLDL cholesterol fractions were calculated using Friedewald’s formula.  4.4.2. Enzymatic Assays Enzymatic activities were assayed fluorimetrically using aminoacyl-beta naphthylamides (aaNNap) as substrates. GluAP activity was determined using GluNNap as a substrate according to the method of Ramírez et al. [38]. Briefly, 10 μL of each supernatant were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 100 μL of substrate solution (100 μM GluNNap, 1.5 mM BSA, 0.65 mM DTT and 50 mM CaCl2 in 50 mM HCl-Tris buffer pH 7.4).",d9d0f76b-af88-4bc1-a8c7-4f6bb6200ca2
4,methods4," dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV activity was determined with H-Gly-l-Pro-1-hydroxy-4-NNA hydrochloride, also called Gly-Pro-NNap, as the substrate: 10 μL of each supernatant was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 100 μL of substrate solution (100 μM Gly-Pro-NNap, 1.5 mM BSA and 0.65 mM DTT in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.3). gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) was determined with γ-GluNNap as the substrate: 10 μL of each supernatant was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 100 μL of substrate solution (100 μM γ-GluNNap, 1.5 mM BSA and 0.65 mM DTT in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4).  All reactions were stopped by adding 100 μL of 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.2). The amount of β-naphthylamine released as a result of enzymatic activity was measured fluorometrically at 412 nm emission wavelength with 345 nm excitation wavelength.  Specific peptidase activities were expressed as pmol of β-naphthylamine hydrolyzed per minute and per milligram of protein.",45355bc3-0748-4766-9d2e-bb3526d22801
5,methods5," Fluorogenic assays were linear with respect to time of hydrolysis and protein concentration. Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford [39] with BSA as a standard. All chemical products were supplied by Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).  4.4.3. Statistical Analysis For statistical analysis, we used one-way analysis of variance (analysis we used one way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) with post-hoc comparisons using the LSD test. Differences with p-values < 0.05 were considered significant. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to establish the relationship between peptidase activities and plasma lipid levels. All results were expressed as the mean ± standard error.  5. Conclusions The increase in GluAP activity with Bch and the positive correlation observed between testicular GluAP and plasma triglycerides and cholesterol strongly support its role in testicular functions.",f3dd33e8-f0dc-4953-bd34-63d57e4b460f
6,methods6," Moreover, the increase in gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activity in the Bch group could be related to higher levels of oxidative stress in the testes of these animals. Interestingly, these results were not found with virgin olive oil (20%) (VOO). The virgin olive oil (20%) (VOO) diet, rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols, increased the levels of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV activity related to a better immuno-protection in testis. Taken together, these results could help to explain the adverse consequences of high-saturated fatty acids and cholesterol diets on testicular function, support the benefits of a Mediterranean diet and virgin olive oil, and provide new dietary strategies to improve male fertility.
