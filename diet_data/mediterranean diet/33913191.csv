1,methods0," We searched the PubMed, Cochrane, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE)) and Web of Science electronic databases to identify relevant articles published before October 2021. We used the Newcastle–Ottawa scale to assess the quality of the published research and a random-effects model to estimate the aggregate hazard ratios and 95% CIs. As a result of significant heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analysis, meta-regression analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Where data were available, we also performed a dose–response analysis.   Search Strategy  We searched all the studies included in the PubMed, Cochrane, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE)), and Web of Science electronic databases before October 2021.",9942a19a-a09c-4b9f-9740-15e4a5b6321c

We also searched the references of related articles to obtain other potential studies.  Study Selection  We screened the articles based on their titles and abstracts. We excluded studies that did not include a correlation between the Mediterranean diet and lung cancer.,7690669a-f987-4d9e-902d-a6b8eeb01eae
3,methods2," We used the following inclusion criteria: (a) the incidence of lung cancer was used as the outcome; (b) the study design was case–control, cohort, and follow-up studies of randomized clinical trials; and (c) the study provided the odds ratio (OR), risk ratio (RR), hazard ratio (HR) of lung cancer, and the 95% CI, or sufficient data to fully estimate these values. We excluded review articles, studies not published as a full article (e.g., conference abstracts) and studies lacking sufficient data relevant to lung cancer. For overlapping publications, we selected the most recent data with the longest follow-up time.  Data Extraction and Quality Assessment  The data were extracted independently by two investigators (HZD and TRC) from studies that met the inclusion criteria and any ambiguities were resolved by a third investigator.",116e9067-7bd0-451d-9c7d-81ff6c63ea4a
4,methods3," We extracted the following information from each study: first author; year of publication; country; study type; duration of the study; sample size; age; sex; the number of participants in different groups; Mediterranean diet score (Mediterranean diet score (MDS)) system; components of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS); risk estimates; the 95% CIs from the most fully adjusted models for the association between a Mediterranean diet and lung cancer; and adjustment factors.  We evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies according to the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS)) (16). The total Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) score was nine points. Studies identified as having the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) ≥ 7 are considered high quality, whereas studies with a total Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) score < 7 are considered low quality. All the included studies were of high quality.",9bfc4d91-fd74-41d8-b98b-6d3ca9585e44
5,methods4,"  Definition of the Mediterranean Diet Score  The Mediterranean diet score (MDS) was defined specifically to measure adherence to the Mediterranean diet. In our meta-analysis, a Mediterranean diet alternative score (aMED) was adapted for five studies (13, 14, 17–19). Two studies used the Polish Mediterranean diet score (MDS) (Polish-aMED) (20, 21), one used the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) (12) and one used both the modified Mediterranean diet score (MDS) (mMED) and the aMED (15). The Mediterranean diet score (MDS) provides 0 or 1 point for each component. The Mediterranean diet score (MDS) ranged from 0 to 9 or from 0 to 8 depending on whether alcohol was included. Table 1 gives more details about the components of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS).  TABLE 1 Characteristics of studies entered in the meta-analysis.",158fcd28-4d21-4e60-8467-9561eead908a

Statistical Analysis  This meta-analysis aimed to examine the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and the risk of lung cancer in the general population. The associated effects include the OR and HR. Considering that lung cancer is a rare disease with an incidence rate of < 5/1,000, the OR and HR values can be directly combined with the effect size and expressed by the HR value.",c802ec74-8cdf-47c4-90d0-4499f58ff0b8
7,methods12," The most fully adjusted HRs with their 95% CIs from individual studies were extracted and transformed to their logarithms to stabilize the variances and normalize the distributions.  I2 and P-values were used to test the heterogeneity of the included studies. P < 0.05 was considered heterogeneous. I2 > 50% indicated high heterogeneity, 25–50% indicated moderate heterogeneity, and I2 < 25% indicated low heterogeneity. A fixed-effects model was used for combined analysis. Otherwise, a random-effects model was used for analysis when no significant heterogeneity (I2 < 50% or P > 0.05) was observed. As a result of the heterogeneity of the results, we conducted subgroup analysis based on several variables, namely, geographical area, study type, and other study characteristics. We also used meta-regression to explore the source of the heterogeneity. We used Begg’s test (22) and Egger’s regression asymmetry test (23) to test the publication bias and present them in the form of a funnel chart.",be96565b-62dd-4d24-b63f-16ff5c119108
8,methods13," We conducted a sensitivity analysis in which the meta-analysis was repeatedly carried out after omitting each study in turn to observe the stability of the comprehensive results.  The method for determining the dose–response relationship in the meta-analysis was the same as described previously (24). We needed to judge whether this was a linear relationship and we, therefore, conducted a non-linear dose–response meta-analysis using restricted cubic spline models. The results showed a linear dose–response relationship with P > 0.05. We then performed a linear dose–response meta-analysis using the glst function and plotted a linear dose–response relationship diagram. For studies that did not report the number of cases or person-years for each exposure category, the data were estimated by multiplying the proportion of cases in each category by the total person-years using a previously reported method (25).",ebb8a9bc-05f3-46d9-a189-e69ef7e0f08b
9,methods14," The median or mean values of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) for each category were obtained from the original studies when available. When the median or mean values per category were not reported, we calculated the midpoint of the upper and lower boundaries in each category. When the category was open-ended, we used the width of the adjacent interval as the width of the interval. All the analyses were performed using Stata version 11.0.

According to the search strategy, we obtained 376 articles from the databases and 348 articles remained after excluding duplicates. Subsequently, 316 articles were excluded by screening the titles and abstracts and the 32 remaining articles were evaluated further. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we excluded 23 articles, of which two articles had no full text, ten were reviews, four had no complete data, two were conference papers, one did not meet the intervention measures, two did not meet the outcome indicators, one was a randomized controlled trial, and one used repeated data. The remaining nine high-quality articles were included in the meta-analysis (12–15, 17–21).

11,results1,"  Research Characteristics  The nine articles included two case–control studies and seven cohort studies, the main characteristics of which are shown in Table 1. These studies were published between 2016 and 2021. Three studies were conducted in the United States, four studies were conducted in Europe, one study was conducted in Australia, and one study was conducted in Iran. The sample size ranged from 439 to 460,770 cases (936,089 cases in total). Seven studies included both the men and women, one study included men only, and one study included women only. All the nine studies reported the risk of lung cancer associated with Mediterranean diet patterns and the results were evaluated based on various sources, namely, medical records, cancer registries, and hospital databases. Table 2 shows the quality evaluation results. The Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) score ranged from 7 to 9 with an average of 8.

Mediterranean Diet Patterns and the Risk of Lung Cancer  Nine articles discussed the relationship between Mediterranean diet patterns and the risk of lung cancer. Schulpen et al. used two Mediterranean diet assessment methods and assessed the risk of lung cancer in both men and women (15).",36e93de6-5b36-4b38-b153-6d17d4f258e9
14,results4," Twelve sets of data were therefore used in the meta-analysis. A meta-analysis that used a random-effects model showed a significant negative correlation between Mediterranean diet patterns and the risk of lung cancer (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.74–0.92) with high heterogeneity (I2 = 59.9%, P< 0.05) (Figure 2).  FIGURE 2 The relationship between Mediterranean diet patterns and the risk of lung cancer.  Subgroup analyses on geographic area, study type, number of cases, and adjustments for energy intake, family history, age, ethnicity, and education showed a significant association between Mediterranean diet patterns and the risk of lung cancer. The association was overall consistent in analyses stratified by publication time, MD score system, and adjustments for smoking status (Table 3).

15,results7,"016), whereas the publication year and study area did not have a significant impact on the heterogeneity between studies (P = 0.486 and P = 0.716, respectively). Subsequently, we included the two covariates of study type and region in the meta-regression model and performed meta-regression analysis of multiple covariates. We found that the variance component between the studies decreased from 0.0195 to 0, indicating that 100% could be explained.  Dose–Response Analysis  Given that three of the nine articles did not provide dose grouping and the article by Schulpen et al. (15) included four studies, a total of nine studies (12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 21) were included in the dose–response relationship meta-analysis. The results showed a linear dose–response relationship between Mediterranean diet patterns and the risk of lung cancer and the results were meaningful (P < 0.001).",7d88cd8a-0c02-4e6c-9bd9-639f37de7da0
16,results8," In the real life, based on the lowest Mediterranean diet score (MDS) (0 points), for every three-point increase, the HR for lung cancer = 0.91 and the 95% CI = 0.89–0.94; that is, for every three-point increase in the Mediterranean diet score (MDS), the risk of a person developing lung cancer is reduced by 9%. Figure 3 shows the linear dose–response relationship curve. We further explored the dose–response analysis according to the scale range. The linear relation between adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern and the risk of lung cancer showed a reduction of 6% (RR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.89–0.99; P non-linearity = 0.469) of (0–8) and 10% of (0–9) (RR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.87–0.93; P non-linearity = 0.183) for a three-score increase in adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern. The relationship was consistent in dose–response analyses stratified by scale range.

17,results9,  Publication Bias and Sensitivity Analysis  We used Begg’s regression asymmetry test and Egger’s regression asymmetry test to assess publication bias and found no significant publication bias for either Egger’s test (P = 0.226) or Begg’s test (P = 0.086) (Figure 4). We conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine whether the meta-analysis results were stable (Figure 5). The results showed that the results did not change very much after excluding each study in turn. The sensitivity was therefore low and the result was relatively stable.

18,discussion0," The results of our meta-analysis suggested a significant negative correlation between Mediterranean diet patterns and the risk of lung cancer, thereby showing that Mediterranean diet patterns are a protective factor for lung cancer. Further subgroup analysis showed that the type of study was a possible reason for the heterogeneity of the results. Subsequently, the multivariate meta-regression analysis was performed including the two covariates of study type and region. The results showed that 100% of the sources of heterogeneity could be explained. The results of a meta-analysis of the dose–response relationship showed that based on the lowest Mediterranean diet score (MDS) (0 points), each three-point increase reduced the risk of lung cancer by 9%. This study is the first meta-analysis to explore the relationship between Mediterranean diet patterns and the risk of lung cancer in the general population. Our findings are of great significance in reducing the incidence of lung cancer.",d18e5a40-f895-4ee5-8fd5-c96e06638b2a
19,discussion1,"  At present, there are several possible mechanisms linking Mediterranean diet patterns and a reduction in the incidence of lung cancer. First, Mediterranean diets are rich in plant-based foods (e.g., fruit and vegetables), which provide a large amount of dietary fiber and bioactive compounds (e.g., flavonoids, carotenoids, vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin E, folic acid, and coumarin). A higher intake of dietary fiber can reduce the risk of lung cancer (26). Short-chain fatty acids, fermented from dietary fiber by the gut microbiota, have been shown to benefit host immunity and metabolism in organs including the lungs (27). Animal studies have also found that dietary fiber can reshape the immune environment of the lungs by changing the composition of the lung microbiota (28). The fish and nut products typically found in Mediterranean diets are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and help impede cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and inflammation.",05c03037-019b-42d7-9146-c7eac8d353ea
20,discussion2," Olive oil is used almost exclusively as the dietary oil in Mediterranean diets and contains (-)-Oleocanthal (OC). This compound inhibits the progression of lung cancer and metastasis by targeting c-MET and COX2 (29–31). Red wine, frequently consumed in Mediterranean diets, contains polyphenols that exhibit biological functions, namely, DNA polymerase III gene suppression, T-helper cell facilitation, and DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibition (32–35). These effects may slow the transformation and development of cancer cells.  We found a significant negative correlation between Mediterranean diet patterns and the risk of lung cancer. This finding is consistent with the conclusion of a 2003 case–control study, which reported that some typical foods in Mediterranean diets were related to a reduction in the risk of lung cancer (36).",3bce19b3-b5f5-4e19-bdc0-c4fe3ed1f7d5
21,discussion3," Vardavas reported that adhering to a Mediterranean diet pattern and taking in beneficial antioxidants, lipids, and other micronutrients from these diets could have a protective effect against lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. These diets may also have a health impact on smoking and have a positive regulatory role (37), as shown in epidemiological studies. For example, a cohort study conducted by Anic et al. showed that Mediterranean diet patterns are negatively related to lung cancer with HR = 0.85 (0.79–0.91). This association is most common among people who quit smoking, which clearly shows that a Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk of lung cancer in this group (21). In addition, the results of the meta-analysis of the dose–response relationship showed a linear dose–response relationship between the Mediterranean diet and lung cancer.",8d83d44d-b24c-41e9-8620-377e51f4f3a4
22,discussion4," Based on the lowest Mediterranean diet score (MDS) (0 points), for every three-point increase, the risk of lung cancer was reduced by 9%, indicating that the more food types the population consumes in the Mediterranean diet pattern, the lower the risk of lung cancer. This meta-analysis has important clinical significance and can provide a theoretical basis for preventing lung cancer and improving quality of life.  The heterogeneity among studies is a critical issue in meta-analysis and the existence of heterogeneity directly affects the interpretation of the meta-analysis results. We, therefore, focused on exploring the sources of heterogeneity among studies. Although most of the included research results were adjusted for common influencing factors, such as age, sex, race, and smoking status, other factors among the studies may be a source of heterogeneity.",72ac7b29-f29f-4e17-90fa-f65080c4458a
23,discussion5," We carried out a subgroup analysis and did not find significant differences in effect between Mediterranean diet patterns and the risk of lung cancer. The results of the meta-regression showed that the type of study design had a significant impact on heterogeneity among studies, whereas the year of publication and study area did not. A total of nine articles, including seven cohort studies and two case–control studies, were included in this meta-analysis because the etiology hypothesis of the case–control study was weaker than that of the cohort study, which led to the heterogeneity. Heterogeneity may also be caused by other factors, such as personal behavior and lifestyle, and environmental and genetic factors.  This study has many advantages. First, the studies included were prospective cohort studies and retrospective case–control studies with large sample sizes. Second, the included studies were all published in the last 5 years and were all of the high quality.",25e982bd-252d-4631-afed-8332188f9e9e
24,discussion6," The dose–response evaluation of the effects of the included studies may be comprehensive and can effectively explore whether Mediterranean diet patterns are a protective factor for lung cancer. Third, no publication bias was observed in the judgment of P detected by the Begg’s method and the funnel chart was symmetrical. This study, therefore, has no publication bias and the sensitivity analysis results were very stable and reliable.  The results of the meta-analysis have scientific value and significance. We found that there was a significant negative correlation between Mediterranean diet patterns and the risk of lung cancer in the general population, which suggests that Mediterranean diet patterns are a protective factor for lung cancer. These results provide clear information for clinical recommendations and the prevention of lung cancer.  This meta-analysis has some limitations.",ea8290a9-aaa1-469e-874a-00f74731852a
25,discussion7," First, most of the included studies were from Europe, with some studies from the United States and Australia. The results may not be universal as a result of the lack of data from Asia and Africa. Second, a stronger association between Mediterranean diet patterns and lung cancer was observed in the case–control study. The inclusion of case–control studies may lead to recall and selection bias. Considering that the retrospective bias in the case–control study and the patient’s early symptoms may cause changes in eating habits, case–control studies may exaggerate the relevance of the merged results in heterogeneity. Third, some studies have pointed out that Mediterranean diet patterns are related to the risk of lung cancer, but data were not reported or the reported data were incomplete and cannot be combined, which may also lead to deviations in the results.",ef8f8a09-8ae0-4ab9-87d2-c4f6c4931742
26,discussion8,"  Conclusion  This meta-analysis showed a significant negative correlation between the Mediterranean diet pattern and the risk of lung cancer.

This study is the first meta-analysis to explore the relationship between Mediterranean diet patterns and the risk of lung cancer in the general population. Our findings are of great significance in reducing the incidence of lung cancer. More epidemiological studies, especially cohort studies, should be encouraged to further understand the mechanism.
