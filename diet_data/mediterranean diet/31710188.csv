Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), body weight and markers of insulin resistance affect BRCA penetrance. We conducted a multicenter prospective two-armed (1:1) randomized controlled trial (NCT03066856) to investigate whether a Mediterranean dietary intervention with moderate protein restriction reduces IGF-I and other metabolic modulators of BRCA penetrance. Methods: BRCA carriers, with or without a previous cancer, aged 18–70 years and without metastases were randomly assigned to an active dietary intervention group (IG) or to a control group (CG). The primary endpoint of the intervention was the IGF-I reduction. Results: 416 women (216 in the IG and 200 in the CG) concluded the six-month dietary intervention.

Introduction Women with a deleterious mutation in the BRCA1/2 genes face a lifetime risk (penetrance) of developing breast cancer (BC) in the order of 55%, compared to 12% in the general population, and of developing ovarian cancer (OC) in the order of 16–59% [1,2,3].",89d81cd1-a15c-42b4-a18c-e3099a133a70
2,abstract2," A more recent prospective study of 10,000 female carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations [4] showed a 72% chance of developing BC by age 80 (95% CI, 65–79%) for BRCA1 and a 69% chance (95% CI, 61–77%) for BRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively. The lifetime risk of developing OC was 44% (95% CI, 36–55%) for BRCA1 and 17% (95% CI, 11–25%) for BRCA2 mutation carriers [4]. Given the incomplete penetrance, our hypothesis is that other factors, genetic (polymorphisms) and/or “environmental”, influence the cancer risk.  Cancer risk is higher if genotype carriers are obese or have high energy intake and life-long weight gain [5,6]. Obesity may affect BRCA penetrance through a number of mechanisms, including insulin resistance and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) regulation. Women with BRCA1/2 mutations more frequently develop type-2 diabetes after a BC diagnosis [7] compared with carriers without cancer.",fc3d3a97-9ada-4b54-aa5e-b86003b4b0c1
3,abstract3," The prediabetic condition, when the levels of insulin and growth factors are typically very high, can raise the risk of BC in these women. Consistently, retrospective case-control analyses suggested that IGF-I and metabolic syndrome (MS) were associated with an increased BRCA penetrance [8,9].  We conducted a randomized controlled trial [10,11,12,13,14] of women with deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations to test whether a Mediterranean dietary intervention with moderate protein restriction significantly reduces IGF-I and other potential modulators of penetrance.   This paper reports the final results of the trial.  2. Results  A total of 572 women attended the recruitment meetings and signed informed consent forms (Figure 1).  Seventy chose not to proceed before the randomization and “family reasons” was the leading reason for dropping out (42%).",a5624cb0-787d-46d6-9f54-c0bb28615d70
4,abstract4," Therefore, 502 women with BRCA1/2 mutations (198 unaffected and 304 affected) were randomized, 254 in the intervention group (IG) and 248 in the control group (CG).   Table 1 reports the general characteristics of the trial population by randomization group.  IG women were slightly older, with fewer current smokers (p = 0.27). They had a nonsignificantly higher frequency of natural menopause (p = 0.37) and of previous preventive salpingo-oophorectomy (p = 0.51). The distribution of previous cancer, type of cancer, age at diagnosis and years from cancer diagnosis were similar. Among BCs, the proportions of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors and of the axillary node metastases were homogeneous. However, the distribution of BRCA1/2 mutations significantly differed in the two groups (p = 0.01) (Table 1). Current cancer hormonal treatment was homogeneous between the two randomized groups (p = 0.65).",27d8a6f9-3dbc-4071-94ed-59718ee62794
5,abstract5,"  At baseline, IG women presented a nonsignificantly slightly lower BMI and waist circumference (respectively p = 0.07 and p = 0.10) and a significantly smaller hip circumference (p = 0.01). The two randomized groups were homogeneous as regards metabolic parameters and serum levels of insulin and IGF-I (data not shown).  As for their 24-h food frequency diaries on baseline food intake (Table S1), the CG had slightly higher, although nonsignificantly, consumption of sugary food and beverages (about 2 times/day vs. 1.6 times/day in the IG, p = 0.05), legumes/soy products (about 0.4 times/day vs. 0.3 times/day in the IG, p = 0.11) and red/processed meat (about 0.5 time/day vs. 0.4 times/day in the IG, p = 0.06).

6,abstract6," Consistently, intervention and control women reported similar Mediterranean food consumption, with total Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) scores of (on average) 7.2 and 7.1 (p = 0.54), respectively.   Out of 502 participants, 416 women (83%), 216 in the IG and 200 in the CG, concluded the six-month dietary intervention and were available for the final examinations. After randomization, 4 women became pregnant (2 in the IG and 2 in the CG), 10 relapsed (6 in the IG and 4 in the CG), 1 had a stroke (in the IG) and 35 changed their mind for family/work reasons (13 in the IG and 22 in the CG), thus effectively dropping from the study without any dietary intervention. Another 36 women (16 in the IG and 20 in the CG) partially complied with the nutritional activities but did not turn up for the final examinations. Overall, the proportions of dropout were 15% in the IG and 19% in the CG.",df47bf95-728a-4a6c-8f14-384620ff2818
7,abstract7,"  In both groups, most of the anthropometric and metabolic parameters significantly improved at the end of the six-month dietary intervention (Table 2). However, control women did not show any significant reduction in hip circumference or total cholesterol and their triglycerides rose. The CG had no substantial changes in IGF-I (−1.3 ng/mL, p = 0.67) while the IG showed a significant reduction (−11.3 ng/mL, p < 0.001). Both groups showed a significant reduction in insulin levels (−5.3 μIU/mL, p < 0.001 in the CG and −7.7 μIU/mL, p < 0.001 in the IG).   The results of the “delta” analysis of differences between the two groups (intention-to-treat analysis), controlling for center, age, education, BMI at baseline and menstrual status, showed that the IG lost significantly more weight (p < 0.001) and BMI (p < 0.001) and lowered waist circumference (p = 0.01), hip circumference (p = 0.01), total cholesterol (p = 0.04) and triglycerides (p = 0.01) significantly more than the CG (Table 2).",d3724563-0db3-461d-88b8-317423bc0934
8,abstract8," The IG significantly lowered IGF-I levels (p = 0.02) with respect to the CG (Table 2). Repeating the analyses on metabolic factors and IGF-I after further controlling for weight change, the results continued to show significant reductions in triglycerides (p = 0.02) and IGF-I (p = 0.03), while the reduction in total cholesterol became borderline significant (p = 0.05).  The results did not change after controlling for the baseline value of the variable under study. They did not differ after stratifying for type of BRCA mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2).  Compared to the CG, the IG significantly improved their consumption of the recommended food, i.e., whole grain products (p < 0.001), legumes (p = 0.02) and nuts and seeds (p = 0.02), and significantly reduced their consumption of dairy products (p = 0.01) and of red and processed meat (p = 0.04) (Figure 2).",ebdeb1b1-e762-4a0f-b619-ca09c2f9d95b
9,abstract9,"   The distribution of the “Delta, Δ” changes in frequencies of food consumption in the IG and in the CG is represented by a Kiviat diagram. This graphic representation consists of a sequence of rays which originate from a center and form equal angles to each other; each ray represents one food/food group. The distance from the center of the point marked on the radius is the “Delta, Δ” change of frequencies of food/food group consumption. The points on the rays are joined with two segments, continuous for the IG and dashed for the CG.  Adjusted multiple regression analysis suggested that the reduction in animal products consumption was directly related, although nonsignificantly, to the reduction of IGF-I levels (p = 0.09) and randomization group (p = 0.01).",4ace578e-fd6c-47ae-a2b2-264deba047af
10,abstract10," Furthermore, in the multinomial logistic regression analysis on the whole population, women who experienced the higher reduction in animal products (at least –1 frequency/day of animal products consumption) showed an Odds Ratio OR of 1.21 (1.04–1.41 95% CI), placing them in the higher tertile of reduction of IGF-I (Table 3). These results were significant only in the IG with an OR of 1.32 (1.08–1.62 95% CI) vs. an OR of 1.10 (0.86–1.42 95% CI) in the CG.  We did not observe any significant associations involving the reduction of legumes, refined products consumption or body weight.  The “delta” analysis of differences in the consumption of Mediterranean food (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) data) confirmed previous food’s results. Compared to the CG, intervention women had a significantly larger improvement in the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score (Table S2).  3.",50ef4eda-e4cc-4a55-bcfe-b3661dbc9a7b
11,abstract11," Discussion Findings from this Italian randomized controlled trial show that a dietary intervention based on the MedDiet with moderate protein restriction is effective in reducing IGF-I and other potential modulators of BRCA penetrance. Women in the IG significantly increased their adherence to the MedDiet, enjoyed substantial improvements in their metabolic and anthropometric parameters and showed a significant decrease in the serum levels of IGF-I with respect to the CG.   The reduction of IGF-I was the primary endpoint of our trial. Previous studies found that IGF-I and lifestyle factors linked to the insulin-IGF-I axis, such as body weight, high energy intake, milk intake and low levels of physical activity, were associated with a higher BRCA penetrance [5,6,9,15,16]. However, these associations mainly come from retrospective analyses and the results might be strongly distorted by bias (i.e., temporal, recall, survival).",5a35f873-d85a-47b4-a23f-05e7d24b8868
12,abstract12," The follow-up of this trial cohort, with prospective evaluation of the data we collected, will give us the opportunity of studying the “environmental” modulators of BRCA penetrance and their impact in the natural history of BRCA-related cancer.   Our results also suggest that control women reported changes in some parameters of interest. These improvements were partially expected, by design. In fact, all the women, on the day they were recruited, were given general lifestyle recommendations (the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research WCRF/AICR decalogue) and received a standard meal that respected WCRF principles [17]. These recommendations and the attention of women carriers of BRCA mutations to the benefits of a healthy lifestyle probably led the CG to make some adjustments in their dietary habits.",5c68ef05-3d18-4425-a7a1-f6433c2534da
13,abstract13," The CG, however, presented no changes in body weight, cholesterol, triglycerides or IGF-I: calorie and especially protein restriction are required to reduce IGF-I and only participation in the specific nutritional activities fostered the change.  Previous trials tried to act on IGF-I through an insulin-lowering diet, succeeding in reducing IGF-I bioavailability by increasing the liver synthesis of IGF-binding proteins 1 and 2, but this did not lower the serum levels [18,19,20]. Reducing protein intake to 0.9 g per kg per day markedly lowered the IGF-I concentration, suggesting that calorie restriction does not reduce IGF-I unless protein intake is reduced as well [21]. In the present trial, our broad changes in diet aimed at reducing calorie intake through the reduction of high glycaemic/insulinemic index food and saturated fat sources and reducing protein intake through a significant reduction of animal products consumption, thus lowering serum levels of IGF-I.",8ab1c6b5-2e28-4482-89bd-1811861ec9e7
14,abstract14," The entries from the 24-h food frequency diaries indicate that intervention women markedly reduced their intake of dairy and total animal products and high calorie-dense food (sugars and refined products) and ate more satiating food (whole grain products and legumes). Data from the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaires confirm these changes in the dietary habits of intervention women and show their increased adherence to the MedDiet. The IG experienced greater dietary changes compared to the CG and achieved greater reductions in body weight, metabolic parameters and IGF-I levels. Our dietary instruments did not allow measurement of the women’s nutrients intake and the frequencies/day of consumption from our 24-h diaries are only proxies of the absolute intake. Therefore, our findings might be related to a reduced energy intake, a reduced protein intake, an increase in Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score or a combination of these factors.",cb671b44-853b-46b1-b5b1-317268e4b306
15,abstract15," However, when we studied the association between the reduction of serum levels of IGF-I and the reductions in body weight and in several food consumptions, our results suggested a direct relationship between the reduction in animal products and the reduction in IGF-I. In fact, compared to women whose consumption of animal products did not change or got worse, women who reduced at least 1 frequency/day of animal products enjoyed a larger reduction of IGF-I.   In the intention-to-treat analysis, the reduction of IGF-I levels in the intervention women compared to the CG persisted at a significant level after further adjustment for weight loss. This finding and the above described results about the association with food consumptions suggest that the change in IGF-I was due more to the composition of the diet than just the lower calorie intake.   Women with deleterious mutations in BRCA1/2 often spend a large part of their life dealing with their genetic risk of cancer.",99be030e-ec1f-48a4-92a2-41a33465836a
16,abstract16," Despite ad hoc surveys and the strong protection offered by prophylactic surgery, acceptance of these options varies among individuals and by country. Women often inquire about less invasive risk-reducing options, including dietary and physical activity recommendations, and physicians need to be able to give them evidence-based answers regarding their lifestyle choices, especially for those who opt not to undergo surgery or chemoprevention. The present results and our previous findings [10,11,13] indicate that women carriers, if properly instructed, are capable of substantially improving their dietary habits, with significant reduction in their potential modulators of BRCA penetrance.",e1520fc4-c1da-4ac1-bb43-b40de549949b
17,abstract17," In Germany, the lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE) study has concluded its feasibility phase (lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-1) confirming the practicability of an intervention involving Mediterranean diet and physical activity in BRCA mutation carriers [22,23]. Women from the German cohort increased their Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score after a 12-month intervention with similar improvements of our cohort. The prospective evaluation of the German cohort (lifestyle intervention study in women with hereditary breast cancer (LIBRE)-2) is ongoing. The future results of the Italian and the German studies will allow us to clarify the role of lifestyle in BRCA penetrance.  Our trial has some limitations. At baseline, there were some differences in BMI, hip circumference and the distribution of BRCA1/2 mutations between the IG and CG.",d4a59433-4b6d-491d-bfb8-91c29d27c3ba
18,abstract18," This was probably due to the fact that the randomization, for ethical and practical reasons, was balanced for family relationship and women belonging to the same family were randomized in the same randomization group by study protocol. However, repeating the analyses controlling for the baseline value of the variable under study did not change the overall results. Furthermore, results did not differ when stratifying the analysis for type of mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2). Actually, we did not expect a different response to the dietary intervention on the basis of the type of mutation.   The baseline differences between the IG and CG did not involve IGF-I and metabolic parameters.   One limitation of this study was that without a prospective evaluation we could not quantify how the reduction of serum IGF-I affected the BRCA-related cancer risk. Prospective studies have investigated the association between IGF-I and the risk of sporadic BC [24].",337e9f82-83cb-4092-8f71-5c96b77cfa10
19,abstract19," By considering the relative risk of BC reported by our research group in the ORDET Italian cohort [25], we can estimate that the ~11% reduction of serum levels of IGF-I that we obtained through the dietary intervention corresponds to a reduction in the BC risk in the order of 10–20%. This is only an estimate about the potential protective effect of the reduction of IGF-I because no prospective studies exist in this context on BRCA mutation carriers. By following up our trial cohort over time we hope to demonstrate a reduction in BRCA-related cancer risk, or less progressive disease, and lower cancer mortality rates in women adhering to a healthy lifestyle.   Another limitation was that intervention women had lower serum insulin but the change compared to CG was not significant. There was a similar effect for plasma glucose. The general improvements of the CG and their reductions in consumption of refined foods and sweets might well explain this.",3d3ef111-037f-4687-9eff-a50c874edaf2
20,abstract20," Furthermore, to help women reduce their animal protein intake, we encouraged the consumption of whole-grain cereals, legumes and vegetables, thus probably increasing the share of complex carbohydrates in their diet. Carbohydrates contributed 55–60% of total calories in our menus.  A further limitation was that, although the IG were given notes on the nutritional content of the menus proposed and recipes to be cooked at home, we did not use any dietary instruments to estimate the women’s nutrient intake. However, the 24-h diaries were extremely efficient for describing and comparing the average consumption of specific foods and dietary patterns between populations, in line with our aim [26].  Increasing attention is being paid to BRCA-related cancer. However, lifestyle intervention studies in women carriers of mutations in BRCA1/2 are still rare and this Italian study is currently the largest prospective two-arm dietary randomized controlled trial with results.",a9b8824a-887d-4be4-a8ba-ad79155134b2

Patients and Methods 4.1. Study and Subjects This Italian multicenter prospective two-armed randomized (1:1) controlled trial (reference: NCT03066856) aimed at investigating whether an active dietary intervention based on the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with moderate protein restriction—mainly animal protein, down to ~11% of total calorie intake—significantly reduced IGF-I and metabolic modulators of BRCA penetrance. Detailed information regarding the study design and preliminary results have been previously reported [9,10,11,12].

Dietary Intervention Women randomized in the IG were invited to attend six full days of dietary activities, involving six cookery courses followed by lunch and six nutritional conferences, over the following six months. The proposed diet (Figure S1), mainly based on MedDiet principles and recipes, and including some fermented food from the Japanese tradition (miso, soy sauce, tempeh, humeboshi) to facilitate digestion and serve as a reliable reservoir for microbiota [28], aimed to:reduce the overall consumption of animal food in order to lower protein intake to ~11% of total calorie intake. Animal milk, associated with higher plasma levels of IGF-I [29], was markedly limited. The use of plant-based unsweetened milk and creams was encouraged. Among animal food, fish, especially cold-water fish (e.g.",3709451f-add8-406c-9715-47ff07429b9f

Our goal was ~0.9–1.1 g/kg body weight. IG women received the menus supplied during cookery classes, recipes and handouts with illustrations of the food portions, especially of food with high protein content;  markedly reduce the consumption of refined foods, such as sugar, sugary drinks, refined food, potatoes and sweets, that promote pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Center, age, education, BMI at baseline, menstrual status and randomization group were used as model covariates.   A p-value of < 0.05 was taken as significant. All statistical tests were two-sided. Analyses were done using the STATA 14 statistical package (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).  5. Conclusions Unmet clinical needs in women with deleterious mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes include lifestyle recommendations as adjuvant support and risk-reducing options.",7c135cd7-9246-4b2d-9d1a-9975df52e458
33,abstract33,"   Our findings suggest that women carriers, if properly instructed, are capable of increasing their adherence to the MedDiet, of enjoying substantial improvements in their metabolic and anthropometric parameters and of significantly lowering serum levels of IGF-I.   This Italian study is currently the largest prospective two-arm dietary randomized controlled trial in women carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations and these results are promising. Further analyses and the follow-up of the cohort will help in developing practical and safe prevention interventions in BRCA families. ",d95392bf-d9f0-40b8-93c8-58e8f16abcdf
