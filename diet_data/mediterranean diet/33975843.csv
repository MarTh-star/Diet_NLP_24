0,background0," Maternal metabolic insults as well as Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)) influence the fetal health and may affect ‘offspring’s susceptibility to chronic diseases via epigenetic modifications. Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), the most common metabolic disorder in pregnancy, can be considered the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. A critical point in this view is the identification of genes which are epigenetically modified under the influence of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). The melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene plays a crucial role in nutritional health by suppressing appetite and participating in energy control regulation. The correlations between pregnant ‘women’s metabolic profiles and placental epigenetic modifications of this gene have been poorly investigated.",dfa26c93-c8d7-4a06-90a1-218162d3d24c
1,background1,"  Objective  The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and maternal clinical parameters at the third trimester of pregnancy to DNA methylation levels in the placenta at CpG sites of MC4R gene.  Design and Methods  Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, Mediterranean diet adherence, smoking habits, and physical activity were assessed at the third trimester of pregnancy of 60 Caucasian pregnant women, of which 33 with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). Clinical parameters of the newborns were recorded at birth. MC4R DNA methylation on maternal and fetal sides of the placenta was analyzed using bisulfite pyrosequencing.

2,methods0," Study Design and Participants  Sixty caucasian pregnant women (age 33.9 ± 5.1 years) attending the Diabetes, Nutrition, and Metabolism Unit and the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinic, “G. d’Annunzio” University-Hospital “SS Annunziata” of Chieti, were recruited. Women with a positive history of drug or alcohol abuse, pre-gestational type 1 or 2 diabetes, overt diabetes, as well as other chronic diseases (such as malignancy, hypercholesterolemia) were excluded.  The Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) diagnosis was performed following the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG)) criteria (29). Thirty-three women had Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), whereas twenty-seven were normoglycemic (normoglycemic (NGT)). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the “G. d’Annunzio” University, Chieti-Pescara.",be7a7d5a-3284-49f4-8028-f9c2edcef735
3,methods1," In compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, all subjects provided written informed consent before their inclusion in the study.  During the first visit, data on demographic characteristics were collected. Anthropometric parameters were measured and recorded according to standard procedures. Clinical parameters including blood glucose, lipid profile [total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG)], and blood pressure were recorded at the third trimester. Specific attention was devoted to the record of smoke habits of the women. Physical activity was assessed using a short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)), and Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (Med-Diet) was evaluated through a validated 14-item questionnaire (PREDIMED) (30, 31).",02c65c01-b910-4068-acd6-ed60ae3323da
4,methods2," Clinical information about the newborns, including mode of delivery, gestational age, sex, and anthropometric measurements, was collected at birth.  Placenta Tissue Sampling  Placenta biopsies of 0.5 cm3 were taken on the fetal and maternal sides within a few minutes after delivery and placenta expulsion in all women. In brief, placental biopsies were washed in PBS 1X and kept in RNAlater Stabilization Solution (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) at −80°C until nucleic acid extraction. DNA was purified using MagPurix 12s AutomatedNucleic Acid Purification System (Zinexts Life ScienceCorp., Taiwan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as previously reported (32).  Epigenetic Analysis (DNA Methylation Analysis)  DNA methylation levels at CpG sites were assessed using pyrosequencing (Qiagen, Pyromark Q96; Diatech Italy).",518733bf-2ac6-4d34-87f3-aab8f78c6840
5,methods3," In brief, genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite (NaBis) using the EpiTect Plus DNA Bisulfite Kit (33) (Qiagen), converting unmethylated cytosines to uracils. After bisulfite treatment, DNA (∼50 ng) was amplified by PCR using the Pyromark PCR kit (200) (Qiagen) and pyrosequenced according to manufacturer’s recommendations. The conditions in the PCR stage were 95°C for 15 min, 45 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR and pyrosequencing primers for the two CpGs tested within the MC4R gene (18q21.32) were MC4R F: 5′-AGGGTGATATAGATTTAGATGTAGAAGT-3′, MC4RR:5′[Btn]AAACAATATACTTTCCATTTCATTTTACAC -3′ (220 bp), and MC4RSeq: 5′- GTAGAAGTTTTTGAAGT TTG-3′ (2CpGs) as previously reported (34).

Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho)estimate the relationship between DNA methylation levels at CpG1 and CpG2 on the fetal and maternal side of the placenta and oral glucose tolerance test (oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) at baseline after 60 min and after 120 min. Pearson’s χ2 test was performed to compare for qualitative variables and unpaired t-test to assess mean differences.  To assess the potential confounding effect of insulin treatment, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was applied. Furthermore, to identify possible confounding effects of the BMI on DNA methylation levels, we performed different multivariate linear regression models. We used the DNA methylation levels on maternal and fetal sides of the placenta as dependent variables, including two groups factor (Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) vs. normoglycemic (NGT)) as covariate and adjusting for BMI.",5cb1bb08-baf8-4c2f-b168-267db0018818
7,methods5,"  Moderation analysis is used to examine if the effect of an independent variable on the dependent variable is the same across different levels of another independent variable (moderator).  The simple slope analysis was employed to test moderating effects of smoking habit on the CpG1 and CpG2 methylation into the relationship with lipid profile and BMI in the pre-pregnancy period. All statistical tests were 2-sided with a significance level set at p < 0.050. All analyses were performed with the open-source statistical R environment (version 3.4.3, the R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). ",de14732a-87d2-42ed-95bb-af16863e70fa

Moreover, DNA methylation on the maternal side was correlated to 1-h and 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose concentrations at CpG2 in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and control groups (Figure 1). In addition, DNA methylation on the maternal side was also positively related to 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose concentrations at CpG1 in both groups (Figure 1).

Moreover, multivariate linear regression model shows that BMI could not be considered a confounder of relationship between groups and DNA methylation levels (data not shown).  Moreover, maternal DNA methylation level at the CpG2 was also associated with LDL-C at the third trimester of pregnancy (rho = 0.340, p < 0.050) while CpG1 methylation was negatively related to maternal weight variations at delivery (rho = −0.316, p < 0.050).",a8672199-e71f-49e4-b260-1ede5d21cbd8

14,discussion0," To the best of our knowledge, the present study investigates, for the first time, DNA methylation profiles of the MC4R gene on both the maternal and the fetal side of the placenta in pregnant women with and without Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). Our results showed that the methylation profile at the CpG1 and CpG2 sites was significantly lower on the fetal side of placenta in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) women when compared with controls.  We found that Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) women had a significantly greater BMI in both periods, pre-pregnancy and at the end of pregnancy, which was consistent with previous studies. Even considering BMI as a potential confounder, the significance of the results persisted.  A higher MC4R DNA methylation levels on the maternal side were associated with both higher maternal LDL-C levels at the third trimester of pregnancy and higher maternal glucose concentrations 1 and 2 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).",b9234d7e-0799-46cd-9fab-91ccb6f64695
15,discussion1," In addition, MC4R methylation levels on the maternal side was inversely related to maternal weight variations at delivery in all women.  Increasing evidence has indicated that exposure to adverse maternal factors in pregnancy may trigger short- and long-term complications for the newborn, potentially impairing metabolic health in adult life via epigenetic mechanisms (6). In this view, great attention has been devoted to identification of genes involved in this process. MC4R was selected since the associations between variants in this gene with obesity, T2D, and eating behavior have been widely studied (17, 18), and recently it has been reported to be differentially methylated in spermatozoa of lean subjects as compared to obese patients (35), as well as in vegans as compared to omnivores (34).  It has been shown that defects in MC4R can lead to a clinical phenotype defined by lack of satiety and early-onset obesity (36–39). Moreover, Morgan et al.",f81818cf-e457-4a01-b94a-ac0a7655c6e1
16,discussion2," (14) demonstrated that MC4R signaling differentially regulates a set of different physiological functions and glucose homeostasis regardless of energy balance, as evidenced also by data on animal models where the deletion of Mc4r gene in both sympathetic and parasympathetic cholinergic neurons impaired glucose homeostasis, leading to hyperinsulinemia and modest insulin resistance (40, 41). In this context, previous observations have shown that MC4R-agonism enhances peripheral insulin sensitivity and improves glucose tolerance in rodents and non-human primates (42, 43). Taken together, all these observations raise the question about possible MC4R placental epigenetic alterations induced by Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy and the potential increased risk of alterations in glucose homeostasis in the offspring.",e480572e-0ba8-43b0-9b0f-e09a101de5ad
17,discussion3," As a matter of fact, results obtained in the present study evidenced a decreased in MC4R DNA methylation levels on the fetal side of the placenta in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) women. Regarding our results about the correlation between MC4R DNA methylation levels and maternal LDL-C levels, it is newsworthy to note that besides having a prominent role in metabolic regulation, it has been suggested that MC4R signaling pathways may affect sympathetic activity and cardiovascular physiology (44). Interestingly, MC4R-null mice showed elevated TG levels and abnormal expression of genes related to fatty acid (FA) synthesis, suggesting an important role of the MC4R in regulating liver FA metabolism (45). In this context, Kwon et al.",0a2a7cb7-aaa5-4f79-9fc8-d48a9be530b0
18,discussion4," (46, 47) showed an association between the MC4R methylation pattern in the cord blood and the metabolic profiles in childhood, especially with regard to the TG level, suggesting that DNA methylation alterations occurring early in life may affect metabolic profiles in childhood (48).  Another interesting point is the one related to maternal smoke. Prenatal smoking exposure has some effects on energy metabolism (33) and causes several adverse health outcomes, including the development of metabolic disorders in adulthood (49). Although evidence from human and animal studies suggested that cigarette smoking during pregnancy influences DNA methylation patterns in mother and offspring (50), the potential pathways mediating nicotine’s effects via epigenetic mechanisms are still unclear.  We previously demonstrated that differences in the methylation patterns of Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene occur in the placental DNA of women exposed to tobacco smoke during pregnancy (32).",827a843c-6340-4061-9511-0279687fd3dc
19,discussion5," As a consequence, in the present study, we aimed to analyze the consequences of maternal smoking on placental DNA methylation of the MC4R gene as well. Our results show that MC4R methylation on the maternal side of placenta was significantly increased in women who smoked during pregnancy, who also showed elevated lipid profile at the third trimester. These results apparently appear to disagree with previous literature data showing that smoking suppresses appetite via the Mc4r activation in rodents (51), as well as with more recent study of Yi et al., demonstrating that the expression of Mc4r is not affected by in utero cigarette smoke exposure (52). However, both these studies were carried out on rat neurons, not on placenta. On the other hand, present findings are consistent with our previous studies, which emphasized the correlation between lipid parameters and smoke during pregnancy along with the identification of genetic and epigenetic markers (32, 53, 54).",ce91cae0-7480-426d-86ba-fce6ad770d8f
20,discussion6,"  It should be noted that one of the limitations of the present study is that gene expression analysis has not been performed in placenta biopsies.  In summary, our study suggests that a common maternal exposure such as smoking may induces placental methylation modifications at MC4R gene, in turn inducing alterations in lipid parameters. It should be noted that the mechanisms underlying the complexity of multiple exposure-outcome relationships are poorly understood, partly due to the dynamic nature of these relationships across the lifecycle (55, 56). As a result, the effects of pre-conceptional and perinatal exposures to insults need to be clarified. It is necessary to improve our understanding of which early-life metabolic exposures may be the most critical for reprogramming the growth trajectories of offspring (55).",083f1b5d-1bf7-4201-b7f7-637b27a60eda
21,discussion7," Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms occurring in the intrauterine period, which is the most sensitive time for the establishment of epigenetic variability, remain largely unexplored.  The most relevant question is whether or not the evidenced relationship between placental DNA methylation at MC4R and maternal conditions may interfere with the metabolic health programming of the newborn. Actually, results obtained on the fetal side of the placenta samples make this question more difficult to answer. In fact, the fetal side of the placenta showed a reduced MC4R methylation, rather than an increased one such as in the maternal side. This could suggest that some sort of adaptation mechanism could take place in order to preserve the health of the offspring. This can be confirmed by the evidence that neonatal parameters in the analyzed sample do not show differences between the offspring of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and controls mothers.",a58296eb-d85b-4bfd-aa3c-905989031da5
22,discussion8," However, it is known that downstream melanocortin-responsive circuits responsible for different physiological actions do diverge, making it crucial an ongoing effort to better understand melanocortin pathways and their myriad roles in metabolic disease (57). Thus, the possible impact of the epigenetic alterations on lipid and glucose metabolism impairments later in life needs to be further evaluated, and further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of maternal insults as well as epigenetic alterations during critical periods of development (such as pregnancy) and their consequences in adult life. In this view, MC4R DNA methylation levels will need to be assessed in these children over time, in order to determine whether the association between DNA methylation at this locus observed in the placenta and the carbohydrate and lipid metabolic clinical parameters does persist throughout infancy and childhood.",ce35fcb8-77d0-44e9-aeeb-6b1d8152742c
