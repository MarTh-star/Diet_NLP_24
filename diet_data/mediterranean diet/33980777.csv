0,methods0," 2.1. Chemicals  Chemicals used for the experiments were acquired from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) in the highest purity available. Aqueous solutions were prepared using type-1 ultrapure water.  2.2. Cell Culture  Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y (SY5Y) cells were transfected with the human amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 coding region and used for all experiments, as previously published [10,27,28]. These SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells were maintained in 250 mL cell culture flasks with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)) (Gibco, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The medium was supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum (FBS)), pyruvate, non-essential amino acids, 1% minimum essential media-vitamins, penicillin, and streptomycin. Furthermore, 3 µg/mL of the antibiotic hygromycin B were added to the medium.",d135705b-0f91-4fb5-b5e8-72a1cd8c5c9f
1,methods1," Twice a week, cells were transferred to new culture flasks to maintain cell health and to prevent overgrowth.  For the preparation of experiments, SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells were collected from the flasks, counted using a Neubauer Chamber, and adjusted to 106 cells/mL. Cells were then transferred into 6-well plates (qPCR, 5 × 105), 24-well plates (Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP), 2 × 105), and 96-well plates (Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and peroxidase assays, 105 cells/well). After 48 h in reduced Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and other supplements identical to cultivating medium), cells were exposed to 10 µg/mL walnut extract in 12% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution (WE). To assess the effect of WE on a complex-I-restricted respiratory system, cells were incubated with 25 µM rotenone 1 h after WE exposure. All cells were used for experimentation after a total of 24 h incubation.",318fa57b-1392-4bcc-b2b9-f065c5b8e65d
2,methods2,"  To circumvent the low solubility of WE and to avoid the formation of lipid droplets in the medium, the extract was taken up in EtOH at a concentration 50 mg/mL and suspended in a 12% bovine serum albumin (bovine serum albumin (BSA))-supplemented medium at a ratio of 2:1 [29]. Conjugation was achieved via constant rotation of the sample for 24 h at 37 °C. A fresh WE sample was regularly prepared and used for each set of experiments. Analogous to this, the same bovine serum albumin (BSA) concentration was also used in the control group. A set of preliminary experiments showed that 12% bovine serum albumin (BSA) did not affect the investigated parameters compared to a medium control.  2.3. Preparation of Lipophilic Walnut Extract  Frozen walnuts harvested in California during the 2017 season were ground in an LN2-filled mortar. The samples were broken down following a protocol for Weibull–Stoldt’s acid hydrolysis.",744a4458-6953-4702-809b-a965780300a6
3,methods3," For this, 5 g of walnut powder was suspended in 150 mL 4 N HCl and boiled and stirred for 30 min. Then, 100 mL of boiling distilled water was added. The hot suspension was immediately filtered and the filter was washed with boiling water until pH-neutral. Filters and residues were dried in a drying cabinet at 105 °C for 3 h.  Soxhlet extraction (Gerhardt Analytical Systems, Königswinter, Germany) was used for fatty acid extraction [30]. Extraction pods were pre-dried overnight and weighed. Dried filters from the previous step were placed in extraction thimbles and topped off with glass wool. Thimbles were placed in corresponding holders and mounted inside the extraction pods. Extraction pods were filled with 160 mL light petroleum before the extraction process was started. Afterward, thimbles and holders were removed. All fats were collected in the extraction pods. The pods were dried and weighed in multiple steps until the weight was constant.",c246c49b-0953-44cb-b485-0d1ee89db939
4,methods4,"  Fatty acid extract was collected in glass vials and stored for further experimentation at −20 °C.  2.4. Determination of Lipid and Vitamin E Composition  Fatty acid samples needed to be esterified before analysis. For this, 4 mL of saturated NaOH in MeOH was added to 100 µL of lipid extract. The mixture was heated to 80 °C for 10 min. After cooling down to r.t., 3.5 mL BF3 (20% in MeOH) was added to the mixture. Samples were vigorously shaken for 2 min and heated to 80 °C for 5 min. After cooling to r.t., 5 mL isooctane was added and heated to 80 °C again for 1 min. A volume of 5 mL saturated NaCl solution was added once the solution reached room temperature again. The organic phases were collected and dried of water using Na2SO4. Samples were diluted at 1:10 in isooctane and then injected into the GC/MS. Vitamin E congeners were quantified by HPLC-FD as previously published [31].  2.5.",021317f2-c296-477b-8789-a48a4327cf42
5,methods5," Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)  Cellular reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) levels were determined via DCFDA/H2DCFDA reaction. The cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay kit was acquired from Abcam (Berlin, Germany) and used following the manufacturer’s guidelines. SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells were treated with 10 µg/mL WE or control (ctrl) for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Fluorescence measurments were performed using a ClarioStar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) at a chosen excitation/emission wavelength of 485/535 nm.  2.6. Peroxidase Activity Assay  Measurement of peroxidase activity in SY5Y cells was achieved using the AmplexTM Red Peroxidase Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to its protocols. Experiments were performed on cells sown into 96-well plates that were incubated with 10 µg/mL WE or ctrl for 24 h.  2.7.",57c29fc2-1852-4b9f-90c9-d51681cb14b5
6,methods6," Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR)  Cells were prepared as mentioned in Section 2.2. and washed off the well plate using PBS. Cells were pelleted at 300 g for 5 min, then resuspended in 1 mL RNAlater (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), frozen in LN2, and stored at −80 °C until use. A RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to isolate the RNA samples.  The quality of RNA was analyzed using a NanoDrop 2000x spectrophotometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). To enhance its quality, RNA was purified using a TurboDNA Free Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After this, 1 µg RNA and the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad, Munich, Germany) were used for the synthesis of cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green technology on a CFX96 Touch real-time PCR detection system (BioRad, Munich, Germany). Samples were analyzed in triplicate at 10 µL. Annealing temperatures, product sizes, concentrations, and sequences of primers are displayed in Table 1.",1c18c2f8-2c0b-474f-90a4-2d5a990a5eae
7,methods7," Data were evaluated according to the 2(−∆∆Cq) method in BioRad CFX manager (BioRad, Munich, Germany) and adjusted to beta-actin (ACTβ), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) expression levels as recommended by the MIQE guidelines [32]. All primers were purchased from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany) or Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany).  2.8. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) Measurements  The Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)lite Luminescence Assay System (Perkin Elmer, Rodgau-Jügesheim, Germany) was used to measure cellular Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. After cells were incubated with WE for 24 h, microwell plates were cooled to room temperature for 10 min. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations were measured as emitted light in a ClarioStar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany).",0ab9206e-79d6-474d-846a-b069fbaf561d
8,methods8," The emission of light is linearly correlated to the Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and was calculated in reference to a standard curve of samples with known concentrations.  2.9. Mitochondrial Membrane Integrity (Mitochondrial Membrane Integrity (MMI)) in SY5Y Cells  After the incubation with WE or ctrl (12% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solvent control), the culture medium was removed. Cells were then washed with 10 mL PBS. PBS was then replaced with 10 mL culture medium and cells were rinsed off the flask surface and triturated to break up cellular lumps. The cell suspension was pelleted at 300 g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 1 mL Ca-Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) (containing 12.6 mM Ca2+). Cells were counted as previously described and diluted to 106 cells/mL. Four reaction tubes were filled with 1 mL of WE-treated cell suspension. To each reaction tube, 10 µL Calcein AM (1 µM) and 20 µL CoCl2 (400 µM) were added.",a39f8fd8-68df-42ad-8f5c-00e820a920dc
9,methods9," Finally, to one reaction tube containing control cells, 10 µL Cyclosporin A (1 µM) was added, while to a second tube, 10 µL ionomycin (50 nM) was added. The same procedure was applied for control cells in parallel. Differences in volume were balanced using the buffer. All reaction tubes were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Afterward, cells were centrifuged at 4 °C and 500 g for 6 min. Reactions tubes were placed on ice and the supernatant was removed. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 400 µL Ca-Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) and pipetted in duplicates of 200 µL into a black 96-well plate. Fluorescence of Calcein AM was quenched by Co2+ following release from mitochondria into the cellular matrix via mPTP opening. Cyclosporin A was added as the negative control, inhibiting the formation of mPTP via binding to Cyclophilin D, thereby maintaining the highest fluorescence signal.",07ee4fec-da12-4aa6-8d72-c88d56a69fcd
10,methods10," Ionomycin was added as the positive control, leading to increased uptake of Ca2+, swelling of and rupture of mitochondria, and quenching most of the fluorescence.  Fluorescence was measured with a ClarioStar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) at an excitation wavelength of 486 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Results were adjusted to protein content determined via the BCA method.  2.10. Citrate Synthase Activity  Cells treated with 10 µg/mL WE or control for 24 h were collected from cell culture flasks, washed with PBS, and diluted to 106 cells/mL. Samples were frozen in LN2 and stored at −80 °C until use. To measure the citrate synthase activity, samples were thawed while a reaction medium (0.1 mM 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (dithio bis (2 nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB)), 50 µM EDTA, 0.31 mM acetyl coenzyme A, 5 mM triethanolamine hydrochloride, and 0.1 M Tris-HCl) was mixed. Then, 40 µL samples were placed into a 96-well plate.",976f7364-11e5-45e9-89f1-d4acbb58b402
11,methods11," To each well, 110 µL of reaction medium was added. The microplate was heated to 30 °C for 5 min. To start the reaction, 50 µL of 0.5 mM oxaloacetate at 30 °C was to each well. Absorbance was measured in a ClarioStar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) at a wavelength of 412 nm for 5 min.  2.11. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP))  We used the fluorescence dye rhodamine-123 (R123) to investigate Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP). Following incubation with WE or control for 24 h, cells were treated with 0.4 µM R123 and kept at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 15 min. Hank’s balanced salt solution (Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS)) buffer (supplemented with Mg2+, Ca2+, and HEPES; pH 7.4; 37 °C) was then used to rinse the cells and to remove excess fluorescence dye. Cells were then centrifuged at 750× g for 5 min. After centrifugation, the medium was aspirated and cells were resuspended in fresh Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS).",1ea5de3b-4eb6-433f-8da5-8c6b8b101961
12,methods12," Following this, the fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm on a ClarioStar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany).  2.12. Aβ1–40 Concentration  Aβ1–40 levels were measured using an Amyloid beta1-40 Kit (Cisbio, Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Cells were treated with 10 µg/mL WE or ctrl for 24 h and collected from the flasks. PBS was used to wash cells once before they were stored in PBS containing cOmpleteTM EDTA-Free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) at −80 °C until the time of the experiment. Samples were thawed and lysed using Cell Extraction Buffer (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) before applying the Amyloid beta1–40 Kit’s protocol. A ClarioStar plate reader with HTRF filters (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) was used to measure fluorescence. For this, emission wavelengths of 665 nm for the acceptor and 620 nm for the donor were selected. Each sample was measured in triplicate.  2.13.",758a3884-93fc-4e83-8338-721579c13f07
13,methods13," Protein Content  To determine the protein contents of previously frozen cells from Mitochondrial Membrane Integrity (MMI), CS, or Aβ1–40 experiments, a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used as intended by the manufacturer. Absorbance levels of the samples were measured in a ClarioStar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany).  2.14. Neurite Outgrowth in SY5Y Cells  Cells were collected from the cell culture flask, counted, and diluted to 105 cells/mL. Cells were then seeded in transparent 6-well plates containing 1 mL Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and a microscopy coverslip. After 24 h, the medium was exchanged for reduced Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and other supplements identical to cultivating medium). Furthermore, 10 µM retinoic acid was added to start the differentiation of cells.",e414a607-dced-424e-942a-3d1311421b63
14,methods14," After 5 days, the medium was changed to unsupplemented Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) for the remaining cultivation. Additionally, cells were treated with 10 µg/mL WE or control.  After a total of 10 days, the medium was removed and cells were washed with 2 mL PBS (1×). Cells were treated with 1 mL ROTI-Histofix ECO plus (Carl Roth, Germany, Karlsruhe) for 20 min, before being washed with 1 mL H2O. After this, cells were stained in 1 mL of acidified hemotoxylin solution for 1 min. Coverslips were removed from the well plate and rinsed with tap water for 15 min. Coverslips were then dipped into eosin solution for 10 s, before being passed through several washing steps in the following order: H2O, 70% EtOH, 90% EtOH, 100% EtOH, 100% isopropanol, and 100% xylol.",c3b901fe-48b4-40d0-873c-680437704625
15,methods15," Finally, one drop of highly viscous Permount (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) was placed on a microscopy slide, then the coverslip, with cells facing down, was placed on top to completely embed cells within the mounting solution. After preparation, slides were dried overnight at room temperature before analysis via microscopy.  Pictures were taken from moderately full areas of the sample to include at least 10 cells. From these cells, the number and length of the longest neurite were determined using Mark Longair’s Simple Neurite Tracer 3.1.4 plugin for ImageJ by an uninvolved scientist. If neurites linked two cells together, the complete neurite length was measured.  2.15. Statistics  Data are presented as arithmetic means with the standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean (standard error of the mean (SEM)). Statistical testing was performed using either Student’s t-test or a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post hoc test.",49f3563c-2fc1-4829-8044-1e282574d1ab
16,methods16," To calculate statistical tests, GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) version 8.2 for Windows was used. Outliers were removed using a ROUT outlier test by applying Q = 1.  3. Results  3.1. Characterization of Walnut Oil  Linoleic acid, oleic acid, and α-linolenic acid were the predominant fatty acids and γ- and δ-tocopherol the major vitamin E compounds in the investigated walnut lipid extract (WE) (Table 2). In total, 100 g of walnuts consisted of 63.14 ± 0.12 g of fats.  3.2. Oxidative Stress Parameters  The cellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was significantly higher in SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells treated with 10 µg/mL WE compared to ctrl (Figure 1A). reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells incubated with higher concentrations of WE (50 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL) did not differ from control.",62ed5915-2b8d-40cd-9802-07346c464bf8
17,methods17," WE significantly decreased the peroxidase activity (Figure 1B), indicating diminished scavenging properties of the cells, which might explain the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Furthermore, relative mRNA expression of Keap1 (Figure 1C), an adaptor protein that suppresses the NFE2L2 signalling pathway and the expression of antioxidative enzymes, was reduced by WE treatment. However, expression of the downstream NFE2L2 gene was unaffected (Figure 1D).  3.3. Membrane Integrity  Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) could potentially lead to increased lipid peroxidation and damage to the membranes. However, the mitochondrial membrane integrity of walnut extract-treated cells was similar to control (Figure 2A).  3.4. Mitochondrial Related Parameters  SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells treated with WE produced significantly more Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) compared to control cells (Figure 2B).",4980a073-ff53-4521-8f6a-899879817f76
18,methods18," When complex I of the ETC was inhibited by the addition of 25 µM rotenone, which is commonly used in models of neurodegenerative diseases [33,34], Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations did not differ between WE-treated cells and control, but were numerically higher (Figure 2C). Mitochondrial membrane potential of cells (Figure 2D) is lower in WE-treated cells, suggesting a small amount of depolarization. Since citrate synthase activity, as a marker for mitochondrial mass [35,36], was significantly increased after WE treatment (Figure 2E), enhanced Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels might stem from increased mitochondrial biogenesis, which could also explain the elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations (Figure 1A). In addition, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production might also stem from the reduced expression of Keap1 and its effects on antioxidation (Figure 1C).",1b86556a-113c-43e7-ab4c-cb8948cbbc02
19,methods19," To follow up on this theory, we investigated the gene expression levels of several markers (Figure 3A–C). Expression of PGC1α was significantly lower in WE-treated cells, while NRF1 showed a trend of being increased and TFAM was virtually identical to control. Since the PGC1α/NRF1/TFAM pathway is commonly linked to mitochondrial biogenesis, these results suggest that this biogenesis is not affected.  3.5. Aβ-Levels  Two hallmarks of AD are the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein and the release of neurotoxic Aβ peptides. Treatment of SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells with WE leads to a significant decrease in Aβ1–40 levels (Figure 2F).  3.6. Neurite Outgrowth  In a previous study, we found that a 6%-walnut-enriched diet could improve the working memory of aged NMRI mice [8]. For this reason, we were interested in whether WE influenced the growth of neurites.",612d6462-4b62-4be0-ace2-aef67aa7e461
20,methods20," We initiated the differentiation of SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells with retinoic acid and treated cells with 10 µg/mL WE to investigate the effects on the continued growth of neurites. Treatment with WE led to significantly longer neurites in SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells (Figure 4A–C).  4. Discussion  Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells, serving as a model for early-onset AD, were treated with a lipid extract from walnuts (WE). Analytically, we focused on fatty acids and vitamin E (VE), which have been reported to be major components of the lipid fraction of walnuts [30].  4.1. Effects on Oxidative Stress  WE increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lowered peroxidase activity in SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells, which could have been expected since n3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) are prone targets for lipid peroxidation. Schönfeld et al.",6ab2c418-48ba-4b3e-90f8-9a09a6e48ae8
21,methods21," reported that free polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) increased the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in states of both normoxia and hypoxia in neuronal PC12 cells [37]. Similarly, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-catalyzed oxidation of dirhodamine 123 to rhodamine 123 was nearly doubled in microvascular endothelial cells upon treatment with 15 µM of different polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), or AA [38]. In yeast, treatment with 1 mM a rich source of α linolenic acid (ALA) led to decreased mitochondrial bioenergetics and viability, as well as an increased peroxidability index and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) [39].  Keap1 gene expression, which is linked to the Keap1/NFE2L2/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway for antioxidative capacity, suggests a diminished ability to respond to oxidative stress.",fd076532-6c52-46f8-9bdd-42cab9e03c38
22,methods22," Naturally, this plays a role in the increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) but was generally not expected, as polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) are reported to induce NFE2L2 and Keap1 [40]. Since the antioxidant response element (antioxidant response element (ARE)) is only a loose term describing a plethora of different genetic sequences, its gene expression is difficult to determine [41]. For this reason, expression data have to be carefully examined. Nevertheless, lower peroxidase activity could be related to lower induction of Keap1 gene expression. Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are not necessarily an indication of harmful effects. In recent years, low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been described to be important signaling molecules, especially in the mitochondrial electron transport chain [42,43] and as a potential inducer of hormesis [44,45].  4.2.",0dc1b125-260b-48b1-b235-52ebb09b9b49
23,methods23," Effects on Membranes  We assessed the quality of mitochondrial membranes and found that both WE- and control-treated cells showed the same calcein fluorescence signal, indicating that WE did not affect membrane leakage or induce damage to the membranes. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the observed increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) had an effect on the membranes. Schönfeld et al. attributed the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels found in PC12 cells to improved intracellular signalling [37]. Rather positive effects of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-catalyzed lipid peroxidation were also described in a human study [46].  4.3. Role of Vitamin E  Due to the VE content, only a small increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) was expected, because VE is a strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger [23,47] that can inhibit lipid peroxidation [48,49]. Overall, α-tocopherol represents the major congener of vitamin E and has been widely studied [48,50].",3b16ebb8-e560-4281-85fc-9857e7b4ea39
24,methods24," Although all congeners exhibit antioxidative properties, α-tocopherol is mainly retained in plasma [47]. In the studied WE, γ-tocopherol was the major vitamin E compound. In combination with oleic acid, γ-tocopherol reduced oxidative damage caused by 7-ketocholesterol, suggesting a protective effect on membranes [51]. Moderate concentrations of γ-tocopherol, ranging from 5 µM to 80 µM, also exceeded the effect of α-tocopherol in reducing Aβ in SY5Y cells [52]. Additionally, lower Aβ levels were associated with high γ-tocopherol concentrations determined post-mortem in the brains of AD patients [53]. The WE contained moderate amounts of 136 mg/kg γ-tocopherol and around 160 mg/kg VE in total. Taking into account the requirements for LPO protection of vitamin E content in relation to unsaturated fatty acids [54] and the presence of other antioxidants [55,56], WE should contain enough antioxidants to protect against oxidation.",663d70d5-943b-4e4c-941f-3827dfb7c58d
25,methods25," It is important to note that these VE requirements [54] apply to RRR-α-tocopherol and not γ-tocopherol, which might play a role in evaluating the efficacy of VE in WE. Several studies have investigated the co-supplementation of n3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) with VE in human trials and have generally reported an increased total antioxidative capacity (total antioxidative capacity (TAC)) [57,58,59]. Occasionally, increased glutathione (glutathione (GSH)) concentrations [58] or reduced malondialdehyde (malondialdehyde (MDA)) levels are noted [57]. Furthermore, increased levels of reactive nitrogen species (reactive nitrogen species (RNS)), similar to reactive oxygen species (ROS), were observed [58,59], but did not affect malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as marker for lipid peroxidation [60]. These results are in agreement with ours, which do not suggest damaged membranes.",a9966f06-d550-430a-8682-36f751883b51
26,methods26," Only a few investigations have specifically examined the combination of n3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) with γ-tocopherol. Himmelfarb et al. combined the n3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and γ-tocopherol at a ratio of around 2.5:1 and found no effect on F2-isoprostane levels as a marker for oxidative stress in the plasma of dialysis patients [61].  4.4. Effects on Mitochondrial Function  Basal Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was improved in SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells following WE treatment and still tended to be elevated after rotenone addition, which inhibits mitochondrial complex I [33,62]. One explanation could be the beneficial effect of VE on mitochondrial function, as we have previously described for rice bran extracts (rice bran extracts (RBE)) [63]. However, since rice bran extracts (RBE) and WE have different vitamin E profiles and amounts, further experiments are needed to confirm this theory.",4a6b9020-dc69-4af2-9bbd-b1e02a68e875
27,methods27," On the other hand, it has also been described that n3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) prevent Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) loss in SH-SY5Y cells after silver nanoparticle-induced damage [64] and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [65]. Since SH-SY5Y cells are among the few cell lines that can synthesize docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from a rich source of α linolenic acid (ALA) [12], positive effects could be linked to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which attenuated MPP+-induced damage [66] and protected dopaminergic neurons against MPP+/MPTP-induced cell damage in the mitochondria of rat liver cells [67]. These reports suggest that WE may have beneficial effects if cells are directly treated. Another explanation for the increased Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations after WE incubation could be a shift to other Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-producing mechanisms such as glycolysis.",317a38e9-ff2d-41de-8e61-f9c0543b08be
28,methods28," Furthermore, we found a statistically significant depolarization of the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP) in WE-treated cells, which might suggest that the increased Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production is related to an enhanced activity of the Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase (complex V). The Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase is driven by the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP), more specifically a translocation of protons from the intermembrane space to the mitochondrial matrix. A small amount of depolarization could, therefore, be observed if CV is enhanced [68], while the ETC activity remains unaffected. Furthermore, slight depolarization also inhibiting excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been described as a crucial component for anti-aging [69]. In this sense, the depolarization observed here might also be a counteraction against the increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS).",de5c2e84-79f0-4b02-9d8e-8f259f0ae5bd
29,methods29," Another theory could be that increased mitochondrial biogenesis is responsible for increased Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. Looking at key transcription factors, however, revealed that NRF1 and TFAM, encoding important parts of the mitochondria such as some complexes of the ETC [70,71,72], were unaffected by WE treatment, while the key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis was expressed to a significantly lower extent in SY5Yamyloid precursor protein (APP)695. In the literature, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) have been reported to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis [73] in white fat and also in rat RIN-m5F cells treated with linoleic acid [74]. Linoleic acid is of paramount importance for mitochondrial biogenesis and new membrane formation, as 60–80% of cardiolipin is composed of one of its derivatives, tetra-linoleoyl cardiolipin [75]. Since 10–20% of mitochondrial membranes consist of cardiolipin, WE would be able to provide an important resource for membrane generation.",d2767289-fcec-47eb-b2a5-1d6b85d02b59
30,methods30," These results, however, do not suggest increased biogenesis, unless PGC1α is downregulated as consequence of its prior activation. Since gene expression does not directly relate to actual protein content and PGC1α expression is described as rather short-lived [76], this might be the case, but it is rather unlikely as there should still be a significant fold change downstream of NRF1 and TFAM. Additionally, data for citrate synthase activity as a marker for mitochondrial content must be considered with caution, as the original correlation was found in skeletal muscle cells [35,77]. Furthermore, there have been reports that have linked NFE2L2 signaling and subsequent antioxidative response to PGC1α as well, suggesting that our observed reduced peroxidase activity might originate from the lower expression of PGC1α [78,79,80].  In this sense, we believe it is more likely that increased Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) stems from enhanced CV activity.  4.5.",2ee34f95-7bd8-47f2-9a2a-6429ea03eb21
31,methods31," Effects on Aβ Production  Similar to our previous work, which showed that the supplementation of the n3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) increased samyloid precursor protein (APP)α and reduced Aβ production [81], we investigated whether WE would affect Aβ concentrations. Treatment of cells with 10 µg/mL WE resulted in significantly lower Aβ1–40 concentrations. polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a rich source of α linolenic acid (ALA), LA, OA, and ARA inhibit the aggregation of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 by up to 84% [82], while docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in combination with tocopherol, lowered Aβ1–42 in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-transfected CHO cells [83]. This is also in line with findings that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) lowered the Aβ burden in a model of aged amyloid precursor protein (APP)sw transgenic mice [84].  4.6.",e7d843db-9b91-4d04-b13e-6dcfbd5e7fd1
32,methods32," Effects on Neuritogenesis  We recently demonstrated that feeding a 6%-walnut-enriched diet to aged NMRI mice led to significantly improved spatial memory [8]. However, we were unable to link this observation directly to mitochondrial function or altered gene expression for neuronal function [8]. Based on these findings, we examined the effect of WE on neurite growth after retinoic acid differentiation in SH-SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells. Indeed, neurites were significantly longer after WE treatment. Although amyloidogenic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is well described and documented as a hallmark of AD, the physiological function of amyloid precursor protein (APP) protein is still a matter of debate. However, several reviews have generally linked amyloid precursor protein (APP) to neurite growth and development [85,86,87].",e4cd26e4-81fd-4836-985a-90c3e5b179ca
33,methods33," For this reason, SY5Y-amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 cells would be expected to grow longer neurites compared to non-transfected cells, which is indeed the case considering the average neurite length of 30–60 µm [88,89]. Since a transfection with amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 not only introduces amyloid precursor protein (APP) into the cells but also leads to increased production of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, these entities have to be considered as well. Contrary to amyloid precursor protein (APP), amyloid-beta peptides have been generally considered to counteract neurite growth [90,91]. Petratos et al. specifically found this to be the case in SH-SY5Y cells [91]. The increased neurite length is, therefore, in good agreement with our results and indirectly supports the reduced Aβ1–40 levels we found. Because of this reduction, neurite growth may be less affected by Aβ and may result in much longer neurites compared with non-transfected SH-SY5Y cells.",ff5533a7-7e91-4372-8c9b-d8fc7512e9dc
34,methods34," Neurite growth plays an important role in neuronal function and development, which also suggests a beneficial effect of WE.  4.7. Limitations  There are limitations to our study. The lipid extract used in the current study could potentially contain minor amounts of other lipophilic compounds as well. Examples include low amounts of squalene and phytosterols, such as campesterol, stigmasterol, and β-sitosterol [56]. While phytosterols are known to lower LDL-cholesterol [92], squalene was reported to improve mitochondrial function and induce peroxidase activity in the livers of rats [55]. Because we observed reduced peroxidase activity after WE treatment in neuroblastoma cells, and since our extraction method resulted in the enrichment of n3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and VE (Table 1), we assume that the effects reported herein are mainly due to n3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and VE as major components of WE.",308b241e-4659-4451-a522-311800161d2d
35,methods35," Another limitation is the fact that this cellular model was used, as this was planned to be a follow-up investigation of our study in animals [8]. Similar to mice characterized by a higher conversion rate of a rich source of α linolenic acid (ALA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) compared to humans [93,94,95], SH-SY5Y cells are also able to facilitate this conversion [12,13]. In the same sense, as it is difficult to translate effects of animal diets to humans [95], the observed effects here should also be understood as preliminary. Finally, most of WE was made up of n3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and as mentioned before these have shown beneficial effects on aging and neuronal function. However, next to their original properties, n3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)s can also be metabolized to a vast array of bioactive components, namely so-called oxylipins [96,97], of which only a few are fully characterized.",5d8ff949-9256-4830-ba2e-7c3d2adaad02
36,methods36," This opens up a broad spectrum of functions and potential targets that need to be investigated in the future.  5. Conclusions  WE might increase Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production due to enhanced complex V activation, while CI-IV remains unaffected. Decreased Aβ1–40 formation and enhanced Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, which could be linked to enhanced neurite growth, suggest that a lipophilic walnut extract has beneficial properties on neuronal development and AD-associated amyloid-beta in a cellular model of early AD. Further research is necessary to link the observed effects to specific ingredients of the extract and to what extent these results can be translated to the human populace.
