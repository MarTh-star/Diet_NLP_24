0,methods0," 4.1. Cell Culture  Rat insulin-secreting INS-1E cells (passage 15–30; a kind gift from C. B. Wollheim, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland) were grown in RPMI-1640 medium with 11.1 mM glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum (FBS)), 100 IU/mL of penicillin, 100 μg/mL of streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids (all from Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cultures were kept in a monolayer at 37 °C in a humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO2. For experiments, cells were seeded in 6-well dishes up to 80% confluence.  4.2. Human Pancreatic Islets  Human pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion from pancreatic biopsies of non-obese, non-diabetic patients undergoing duodenocefalopancreasectomy (dpc) for Vater’s ampulla tumors. Biopsies were excised and processed with the approval of the regional ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from each patient.",66d41011-0d42-472c-b2c2-d35c16301682

Human pancreatic islets were cultured in Medium 199 with Earle’s salts (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 5 mM glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin and streptomycin, 50 µg/mL of gentamicin (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and 0.25 µg/mL of amphotericin (Aurogene s.r.l., Roma, Italy).  4.3. Chemicals and Treatments  Standards of hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, caffeic acid, vanillic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, luteolin, (+)-pinoresinol, oleuropein, and apigenin were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Stock solutions of PCs were prepared in DMSO and stored at −20 °C. Cells were treated with 10 μM PCs, or a mixture thereof, for various times, as indicated. Under control conditions, cells were treated with DMSO only.  4.4.",3d8da152-c02d-45cd-8674-7dd36427f24d
2,methods2," Immunoblotting and Measurement of Apoptosis  For protein analysis, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1% Triton ×100, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mM NaPP, 10 mM NaF, and 4 mM EDTA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets and PhosStop Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets, Roche Diagnostic, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal amounts of protein (40 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotting on polyvinylidene fluoride (polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)) membranes was performed using a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA).",fe0f5767-0af1-4d14-9a3d-25f611e49ae5
3,methods3," Membrane blocking and incubation with primary antibodies were performed with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween, and then membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by washing with tris-buffered saline (tris buffered saline (TBS)) and incubating with a horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used for visualization of proteins with a Model 3000 VersadDoc Imaging System (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA). The signal intensity of each protein band was then measured using Quantity One Software (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) and normalized to the corresponding total protein band. Anti-phosphorylated (p)activation (protein kinase B (AKT) antibody (phosphorylation at Ser473 site; cat. no.",f3010745-1c4e-42ed-bab7-68d137b8e181
4,methods4," 4060), anti-Akt antibody (4691), anti-pcAMP response element binding protein (CREB) antibody (phosphorylation at Ser133 site; 9198), and anti-cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) antibody (9197) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.  Apoptosis was measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS Kit (Roche Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA) according to the manufacturer’ instructions.  4.5. Gene Expression by Quantitative Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)  Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), with genomic DNA contamination eliminated via DNase digestion (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Total RNA (500 ng) was used as a template for cDNA synthesis using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Primers were designed using Primer Express 3.",f5ccf0dc-f4dc-451a-bb9e-eecfbf7fa37b
5,methods5,"0 (Applied Biosystems; see Table 4), and real-time PCR was carried out in a Biorad CFX Connect Real-Time System (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA). Relative gene expression levels were determined by analyzing the changes in SYBR green fluorescence during PCR using the ΔΔCq method. The mRNA level of each gene was then normalized using Gusb (glucuronidase beta) as an internal control.  4.6. Measurement of Insulin Content and Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion (glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS))  To measure insulin content, INS-1E cells were lysed in non-denaturing lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Cell lysates were then cleared by centrifugation and frozen at −70 °C for subsequent determination of insulin concentrations (dilution factor 1:1000).",cf4f7406-1409-40d8-bb2a-9d3308fb985b
6,methods6,"  For glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assessment, INS-1E cells and human pancreatic islets were treated for 1 h with 10 μM PCs or a mixture of 10 μM C1, 10 μM C2, and 10 μM C12. Cells and islets were then cultured for 1 h in 3 mM glucose Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (KRBH); 136 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.25 mM CaCl2, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 5 mMK H2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM HEPES, and 0.5% BSA (pH 7.4)) in the presence of PCs and finally cultured for 1 h in 3 mM glucose Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (KRBH) buffer and for another hour in 25 mM glucose Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (KRBH) buffer. Supernatants were collected and frozen at −70 °C for subsequent determination of insulin concentrations (dilution factor 1:10).
