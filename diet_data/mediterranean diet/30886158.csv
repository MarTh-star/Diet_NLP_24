0,methods0,"4.1. Cell Culture and Treatments The murine neuro-2a (N2a) neuroblastoma cell line (Ref: CCL-131; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) is maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Lonza, Amboise, France) containing 10% (v/v) of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum (FBS)) (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) (30 min, 56 °C) and 1% (v/v) of penicillin (100 U/mL) / streptomycin (100 mg/mL) (Pan Biotech). They were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air) and passaged twice a week. The cells were seeded, for the different experimental conditions, at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells per well containing 1 mL of culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 6-well plates (FALCON, Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France) or in Petri dishes at 30.",94b5c1d0-0f09-4651-8d5d-a55741f84a26
1,methods1,"000 cells/cm2 (100 mm diameter) in order to assess the ability of polyphenols (trans-resveratrol (resveratrol (RSV)), quercetin (quercetin (QCT)) and apigenin (apigenin (API))) and fatty acids (α-linolenic acid (ALA/C18:3 n-3); eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA/C20:5 n-3); docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), C22:6 n-3); oleic acid (OA, C18:1 n-9)) to counteract the cytotoxicity induced by 7-ketocholesterol (7KC). 7KC (Ref: C2394), the polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), quercetin (QCT) and apigenin (API)) and the fatty acids (ALA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and OA) were from Sigma-Aldrich (St Quentin-Fallavier, France) whereas EPA was from Enzo Life Sciences (Villeurbanne, France). The stock solution of 7KC (800 µg/mL; 2 mM) was prepared in a mixture of absolute ethanol and culture medium (0.04, 0.96, v/v) as previously described [27].",bd91d638-7c21-4f28-ab6d-cec9d2aacbe4
2,methods2," The stock solutions of polyphenols were prepared as follows: resveratrol (RSV) at 50 mM in absolute ethanol (EtOH; Carlo Erba Reagents, Val de Reuil, France), whereas dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as vehicle to dissolve quercetin (QCT) and apigenin (API) prepared at 50 mM. Fatty acids stock solutions were prepared at 50 mM (ALA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), OA) or 200 mM (EPA) in absolute ethanol and stored at −20 °C. After 24 h of culture, the culture medium was removed and the cells were further incubated for an additional 48 h period of time with or without polyphenols or fatty acids associated or not with 7KC. Polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), quercetin (QCT) and apigenin (API)) or fatty acids (ALA, EPA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and OA) were used at concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 50 µM and from 1.5 to 200 µM, respectively, to determine their effects on cell viability.",ec58754f-df85-4917-b9de-6a28a8044ee0
3,methods3," When associated with 7KC, polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), quercetin (QCT) and apigenin (API)) and fatty acids (ALA, EPA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and OA) were used at concentrations which have no impact on cell viability ranging from 1.5 to 6.25 µM and from 6.25 to 50 µM, respectively. The choice of the concentration of 7KC is based on the viability tests performed in this study which show that 50 µM is the 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) for N2a cells (Supplementary Figure S1). α-tocopherol (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a positive control for cytoprotection; the α-tocopherol solution was prepared at 80 mM in absolute ethanol and diluted in the culture medium to obtain a 400 μM final concentration. α-tocopherol was used at the highest non-cytotoxic concentration (400 µM) able to prevent 7KC-induced apoptosis [27].  4.2.",792cbab3-86a2-4811-ac28-e6bcf8bd91ed
4,methods4," Quantification of Cell Viability by the Fluorescein Diacetate (fluorescein diacetate (FDA)) Assay  N2a cells viability was assessed using a lipophilic fluorochrome, fluorescein diacetate (fluorescein diacetate (FDA)) (Sigma-Aldrich). In the presence of intracellular esterases of living cells, the non-fluorescent fluorescein diacetate (FDA) is transformed into a green fluorescent metabolite “fluorescein” [16,22]. At the end of the treatment, cells were incubated in the dark with fluorescein diacetate (FDA) (15 µg/mL, 5 min, 37 °C), washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (PBS 0.1 M, pH 7.4), and then lysed with 10 mM Tris-HCl solution containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)). Fluorescence intensity of fluorescein was measured with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 528 nm using a microplate reader (Sunrise spectrophotometer, TECAN, Lyon, France) in order to quantify living cells.",13818fdc-4d65-4c62-91d8-affb06f2a3aa
5,methods5," All assays were performed in at least four independent experiments and realized in triplicate. The results were expressed as % of control: (Fluorescence (assay) × 100)/Fluorescence (control).  4.3. Flow Cytometric Evaluation of Reactive Oxygen Species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) Production Using Dihydroethidium Staining reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, including the intracellular superoxide anion (O2●−), was detected by dihydroethidium staining (dihydroethidium staining (DHE)). dihydroethidium staining (DHE) is a non-fluorescent probe capable of diffusing through the cell membranes; it is rapidly oxidized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to fluorescent hydroethidium (HE) that exhibits an orange/red fluorescence (λ Ex max = 488 nm; λ Em max = 575nm). The HE intercalates at the DNA base level [62].",cb4950f0-c0cd-4097-9499-7b0729f411db
6,methods6," The stock solution of dihydroethidium staining (DHE) (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France) was prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM and was subsequently used on the cells at a final concentration of 2 μM. N2a cells incubated for 48 h with or without 7KC in the presence or absence of polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), quercetin (QCT) or apigenin (API)) or fatty acids (ALA, EPA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), or OA) were trypsinized, washed and then suspended in 1 mL of 1X PBS containing dihydroethidium staining (DHE) (2 μM). After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, the analysis of stained cells was carried out by flow cytometry on a BD Accuri™ C6 flow cytometer. The fluorescence of HE was collected through a 580 nm band pass filter. Ten thousand cells were acquired per sample and the fluorescence was quantified on a logarithmic scale. The data were analyzed with FlowJo software v10.6.2 (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).",2e8c535a-2f9e-43ae-8d2e-75fc56803399
7,methods7," The percentage of reactive oxygen species (ROS) producing cells corresponds to the percentage of HE positive cells. At least three independent experiments were realized.  4.4. Flow Cytometric Measurement of Transmembrane Mitochondrial Potential Using DiOC6(3) The measurement of transmembrane mitochondrial potential (ΔΨm) is widely used to characterize mitochondrial metabolic state and cell death. The decrease in ΔΨm is a sign of a depolarized mitochondria with a poor ability to accumulate lipophilic cationic probes such as 3, 3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide DiOC6(3) (λ Ex max = 484 nm; λ Em max = 501 nm) used in flow cytometry. DiOC6(3) accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix as a function of the potential difference: this probe accumulates all the more in the mitochondria with a normal ΔΨm (living cells) compared to the mitochondria with a low ΔΨm (dying and dead cells) which will cause a decrease in green fluorescence collected through a 520 ± 10 nm band pass filter.",ad3cfa95-0ad1-4495-974d-1353e4573bdc
8,methods8," To evaluate the effect on ΔΨm of the different compounds tested at different concentrations, the adherent and non-adherent cells were pooled after 48 h of treatment, washed and stained with a solution of DiOC6(3) (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 40 nM for 15 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation time, the fluorescence associated with DiOC6(3) was immediately measured on a BD Accuri™ C6 flow cytometer. Ten thousand cells were acquired per sample and the fluorescence was quantified on a logarithmic scale. Data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). The percentage of cells with depolarized mitochondria corresponds to the percentage of DiOC6(3) negative cells. At least three independent experiments were realized.  4.5.",b6648196-8469-4a5a-a3eb-945f5e38aee2
9,methods9," Flow Cytometric Evaluation of Plasma Membrane Permeability and Cell Death Using Propidium Iodide Propidium iodide (PI) is a hydrophilic fluorescent agent intercalating nucleic acids (DNA; RNA) which produces a red/orange fluorescence when it is excited by a blue light (488 nm). It is used to quantify cell viability and plasma membrane permeability: it only stains the nucleic acids of dead cells that have lost their cytoplasmic membrane integrity [63,64]. The stock solution of PI was prepared in milliQ water at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. N2a cells (adherent and nonadherent cells) were stained with a PI solution at 1 μg/mL in 1X PBS for 5 min at 37 °C in order to assess their mortality after a treatment of 48 h with polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), quercetin (QCT) or apigenin (API)) or with fatty acids (ALA, EPA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and OA) associated or not with 7KC.",65959961-73fd-47e2-be47-1d5868cb5779
10,methods10," The cells were analyzed on a BD Accuri™ C6 flow cytometer and the fluorescence of PI was selected on a 630 nm long pass filter. Ten thousand cells were acquired per sample and the fluorescence was quantified on a logarithmic scale. Data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). The percentage of dead cells corresponds to the percentage of PI positive cells. At least three independent experiments were realized.  4.6. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were done using XLSTAT software 2020.1 (Microsoft, St. Redmond, WA, USA). Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD); data were considered statistically different (Mann-Whitney test) at a P-value of 0.05 or less. ",78f0f107-6945-49f1-be19-391938013a7f
