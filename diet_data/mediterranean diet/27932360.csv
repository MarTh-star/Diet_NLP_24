0,methods0,"2.1. Participants During January 2015, all 34 general practices in the city of Bristol, UK, were invited by the Clinical Research Network (West of England) to facilitate the study, and ten expressed willingness. We recruited six general practices, purposively sampled to ensure variation in socioeconomic/ethnicity profiles of their populations, to undertake database searches, according to participant inclusion/exclusion criteria, and send an invitation letter to eligible patients (a detailed patient information sheet was enclosed with the invitation).  Similar to the PREvencion con DIetaMEDiterranea (PREDIMED) study [8], eligible participants were community-dwelling high-risk individuals, aged 55–80 years (men) and 60–80 years (women), who met at least one of three inclusion criteria: (a) diagnosed T2D, (b) having ≥3 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (e.g.",fee8ddd9-9de5-4c4b-ac6d-d6a01182380f
1,methods1,", being overweight or having family history of Cardiovascular disease (CVD)) or (c) having 10-year Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk ≥20%. The latter inclusion criterion was assessed using the QRISK2-2011 score [18] and was incorporated in the original PREvencion con DIetaMEDiterranea (PREDIMED) inclusion criteria because it is commonly assessed in patients of the aforementioned ages who attend National Health Service (NHS) Health Checks in the UK. Participant exclusion criteria included established Cardiovascular disease (CVD), medical conditions impairing participation in a nutrition intervention study, medical conditions limiting survival to <1 year, immunodeficiency, chronic alcoholism or excessive alcohol consumption (>80 g/day), body mass index >40 kg/m2, being institutionalized, lacking autonomy, unable to attend visits,",d67a4208-81e8-4d0d-b8c4-ca7cb67e7a77

Participation was voluntary, and all participants provided written consent prior to data collection commencing. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the protocol was approved by the Health Research Authority, National Research (National Research (NRES)) Committee South West—Central Bristol (reference 14/SW/1127).  2.2. Procedures Data was collected between May and August 2015 at participants’ general practice premises by the same trained researcher, to minimize the potential for inter-interviewer reliability bias. Standard operating procedures were followed to ensure standardization of data collection among participants.",614772dc-0c84-4e4c-a302-51aedb2b4b55
3,methods3," The first appointment involved the collection of a non-fasting blood sample and anthropometric and blood pressure measurements, and the completion of an interviewer-administered demographic questionnaire and the interviewer-administered Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). Participants were then provided with detailed verbal and written instructions to complete a 3-day estimated food record, which they were instructed to start completing approximately two weeks following their first appointment. A second appointment was arranged, approximately one month following the participant’s first appointment, where completed food records were returned and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) was administered again via an interview.  2.3.",2852fd3c-6139-46c3-8148-b003a07905f2

Low-density lipoprotein (Low density lipoprotein (LDL)) cholesterol values were calculated using the Friedewald equation [19]. The ratios of total/high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and TG/high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol were calculated.  Body weight was measured using a calibrated digital scale (Seca 899, Hamburg, Germany), to the nearest 0.1 kg, with the participant barefoot and in light clothing.",9b343891-478d-44fc-807c-ab187113e357
5,methods5," Body height was measured using a wall-mounted calibrated stadiometer (Seca 225, Hamburg, Germany), to the nearest millimeter, with the participant barefoot. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight divided by height, squared (kg/m2). Waist circumference was measured to the nearest millimeter, using a tape at a vertical plane, midway between the lower rib and iliac crest, and with the participant standing and gently breathing out. This measurement was obtained twice, and the mean was calculated.  Systolic (Systolic (SBP)) and diastolic (diastolic (DBP)) blood pressure measurements were obtained from the left arm with an electronic sphygmomanometer, with the participant sitting and after having rested quietly for five minutes. Blood pressure was obtained three times, with an interval of two minutes between measurements. The mean of the second and third measurements was calculated and presented in the current report.  2.4.",1508c302-65b4-4f7a-8695-30c396bd1d70
6,methods6," Demographic Characteristics Participants were asked to report their sex, date of birth, ethnicity [20], marital status [21], highest level of educational attainment [22], current employment status and current smoking status [8]. For ease of interpretation and analysis, categorical variables were collapsed where appropriate. ‘Ethnicity’ was dichotomized into ‘Caucasian’ and ‘other ethnicity’, and ‘marital status’ and ‘current employment status’ were collapsed into ‘single’, ‘married/cohabiting’, and ‘divorced/separated/widowed’, and ‘retired’, ‘employed’ and ‘unemployed’, respectively.  2.5. Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) is a 14-item questionnaire requesting participants to report the habitual frequency of consumption or amount consumed of 12 main components of the MedDiet and two food habits related to the MedDiet [8,14].",977d66bb-834e-4fab-a6a0-3bd524b3fe22
7,methods7," Each of the 14 items is scored 1 or 0, depending on whether participants adhere to each MedDiet component or not. The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) items and the criteria for scoring 1 point are shown in Table S1. If these conditions were not met, an item was assigned a score of 0. The resulting Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MedDiet score ranged from 0 to 14 [8,14]. Photographs of portion and serving sizes were used, as appropriate, to facilitate completion of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) [23].  2.6. Reference Instrument A 3-day estimated food record [24] was used as the reference instrument to establish concurrent validity with the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). This method is considered acceptable for the assessment of usual dietary intake and is commonly used in dietary validation studies [17].",c35efe8a-c310-47c5-b5ba-bf20c76e9691
8,methods8," Participants were asked to record, in as much detail as possible, all foods and beverages consumed over three days (non-consecutive, including one weekend day), describe the amounts consumed in household measures (e.g., slices, cups, spoons) or provide weights, when known (e.g., packaged foods), report cooking methods and provide the recipes for any mixed dishes. Participants were provided with detailed verbal and written information on how to complete their food record and they were encouraged to contact a member of the research team if any questions arose during the procedure. Participants were requested to maintain their usual eating habits throughout the recording period.  Upon return, the food record was reviewed on site by the researcher for completeness with regards to portion sizes, cooking methods and description of foods, and any uncertainties were resolved with participants.",ca9d02bc-e6c1-4648-a345-26f9954619da
9,methods9," Food records were coded by the same researcher, in order to minimize coding variability, and checked for accuracy by a second member of the research team (blinded with respect to the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score), using the Dietplan6 nutrition analysis software (Forestfield Software Ltd., Horsham, UK). Dietplan6 is based on the sixth edition of McCance and Widdowson’s Composition of Foods [25], updated with manufacturers’ data. A food item file was extracted from Dietplan6, listing the amount of all foods eaten at each eating occasion by each participant. All unique food items reported were exported to a list and allocated to a Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) relevant food group.",04e0425f-e028-4424-9e6d-a868a605b891
10,methods10," The food item file was collapsed to compute average number of servings per day or week of each food group, daily frequency of use of different types of fat in cooking or types of meat and weekly frequency of use of sofrito, so that whether participants met the criteria for each component of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) could be assessed (Table S1). The total MedDiet score was computed for each participant from food record data based on the number of 14 criteria met.  2.7. Statistical Analyses We estimated that a sample size of 100 participants would have 80% power to detect a correlation in the total MedDiet score between the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and the 3-day food record of at least 0.3 (alpha of 5%, power of 80%). This would give 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for limits of agreement of approximately ±0.34 standard deviations [14].",57a2d000-3af7-4784-b89e-db42ba3c3706
11,methods11," All analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, n and percentages) were used to report demographic and clinical characteristics of participants.  2.7.1. Concurrent Validity The mean total MedDiet score was calculated from the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and the 3-day estimated food record. Pearson’s r correlation coefficient and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC, two-way mixed effects model with average measures) were used to assess the relative agreement between the two dietary assessment methods. The mean MedDiet score, derived from the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and the food record, was categorized into the same three equal groups (0–3, 3.1–4.7, 4.8–14).",21600cf9-d46a-4925-81f2-a5250ef7c72e
12,methods12," Participants’ cross-classification and the percentage of participants classified into the same, adjacent and opposite categories were determined and agreement within categories between the two dietary assessment methods was then estimated using the kappa (κ) statistic. In validation studies of dietary assessment instruments, κ values from 0 to 0.20 indicate poor agreement, 0.21 to 0.40 fair agreement, 0.41 to 0.60 moderate agreement, 0.61 to 0.80 good agreement and 0.81 to 1 very good agreement [26]. Bland and Altman plots with 95% limits of agreement (mean difference between the MedDiet score derived from the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and food records ± 1.96 × SD of the mean difference) determined absolute agreement in the total MedDiet score between the two methods.",fdf4fa9c-5a3b-44ba-bce4-0ba831a3c099
13,methods13," These plots display the difference between estimates of the same score (MedDiet score) from two methods against the average score from both methods and assess the relationship between the measurement error and the true value, with a mean difference of 0 indicating complete agreement between the methods [27,28]. Agreement between the individual items of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and those derived from the food records was also assessed, using the κ statistic, to understand if concordance in the total MedDiet score was driven by individual score components.  2.7.2. Predictive Validity Linear regression models were fitted to examine the association between the total Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MedDiet score with cardiometabolic, anthropometric and blood pressure variables.",00f6e46c-3d95-414e-b813-3fc1ac490adc
14,methods14," General ordinary least-squares linear modeling was used to estimate energy-adjusted food and nutrient intakes, derived from the food records, according to tertile distribution of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MedDiet score (entered as a continuous variable in the model). The linear trend was assessed by polynomial contrasts and a post hoc Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons.  2.7.3. Test-Retest Reliability The mean total MedDiet score was calculated from the first and second administrations of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). Pearson’s r correlation coefficient and ICC (two-way mixed effects model with average measures) were used to assess relative agreement between the two repeated Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) administrations.",893aff2e-b1c8-4774-ba90-adcc431d0ba7
15,methods15," The mean MedDiet score was categorized into three equal groups, separately for each Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) administration (MedDiet score groups for Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)’ first administration: 0–4.3, 4.4–6, 6.1–14; MedDiet score groups for Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)’ second administration: 0–5, 5.1–6, 6.1–14).  Participant cross-classification and the percentage of them classified into the same, adjacent and opposite categories were established, and agreement within categories between the first and second Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) administration was then estimated using the kappa (κ) statistic and Bland and Altman plots with 95% limits of agreement.  3. Results 3.1. Participant Characteristics Ninety-nine patients at high Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk were recruited from six general practices in Bristol (mean age 68.3 years, mean Body mass index (BMI) 28.3 kg/m2).",8ea30549-36f7-4744-80a2-aeed0c6d6936

Concurrent Validity Ninety-six participants completed the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) at their first appointment and returned a food record. Compared to food records, the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) estimated a higher mean total MedDiet score by 1.47 points (5.47 ± 2.09 vs. 4.00 ± 1.47, 95% CI 1.09–1.85). There was strong evidence of a moderate correlation between the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MedDiet score and the food record MedDiet score (r = 0.50, p < 0.001; ICC = 0.53, 95% CI 0.07–0.74, p < 0.001).",babd1988-8ca6-4901-8787-864638f8165d

Table 2 demonstrates the proportion of participants who met the criteria for achieving each of the 14 points of the score corresponding to each component of the MedDiet by the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and by the food records. A higher proportion of participants achieved a score of 1 via the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), compared to the food records, for fruit (36.5 vs. 25.0%, p < 0.001), red meat (78.1 vs. 71.9%, p = 0.002), wine (30.2 vs. 27.1%, p < 0.001), nuts (33.3 vs. 21.9%, p = 0.017) and sofrito (10.4 vs. 6.3%, p = 0.014).",654e8eda-55bd-4342-bac6-1eb9e9ddb42f
18,methods18," Concordance was highest for wine (κ = 0.72, p < 0.001), whereas total olive oil consumed, and pulses had no agreement. Overall, poor, fair, moderate and good concordance was found for 57.1, 28.6, 7.1 and 7.1% of the components of the MedDiet score, respectively.  The Bland–Altman plot for the total MedDiet score from the two dietary assessment methods is illustrated in Figure 1. The calculation of the mean difference between the two methods (1.47 ± 1.86, 95% limits of agreement −2.2, 5.1) confirmed that the total MedDiet score calculated by the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) was slightly higher, compared to that calculated from the food records.  3.3. Predictive Validity Linear regression analyses found no evidence against the null hypothesis of no associations between the total MedDiet score, derived by the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), and cardiometabolic, and anthropometric and blood pressure variables (Table 3).",a0aa8def-0f2a-4d4c-9869-8006a88c6d11

Test-Retest Reliability  Ninety-six participants completed the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) twice for reliability testing. The two administrations of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) produced a similar mean total MedDiet score (5.5 ± 2.1 vs. 5.4 ± 2.0, p = 0.706) and relative agreement was good (r = 0.69, p < 0.001; ICC = 0.69, 95% CI 0.571–0.783, p < 0.001), indicating good reliability [12,29].",a6373bd9-8d60-4860-9fc1-6b476f7fc749

The calculation of the mean MedDiet score difference between the two Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) administrations (0.06 ± 1.62, 95% limits of agreement −3.1, 3.2) confirmed that the two administrations of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) resulted in similar total MedDiet scores (i.e., almost null bias) (Figure 2).  4.",d64bd2f1-d113-4b8e-bc48-543cd27dff7e
21,methods21," Discussion The aim of the current study was to examine the validity of the English version of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) [14] in assessing adherence to the MedDiet among a sample of high-Cardiovascular disease (CVD)-risk individuals in the UK. This work extends earlier research that assessed the relative validity of the English version of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) in a small sample of adults within tertiary care [16], by recruiting a larger sample of adults who were Cardiovascular disease (CVD) free, using detailed food records as the criterion measure and examining the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)’ test-retest reliability. We showed that the English version of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) provided a borderline fair estimate of MedDiet adherence, when compared to the reference instrument of 3-day estimated food records and similar rankings of participants on the basis of their MedDiet score.",f30a129c-8ab4-4400-bf85-9ed5bb0dc6d7
22,methods22," Test-retest reliability indicated that the English Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) is a reliable instrument to assess MedDiet adherence, with good stability over time.  The moderate relative agreement between the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)- and food record-derived MedDiet scores observed in our study is comparable to the first study assessing the accuracy of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) among Spanish older adults at high risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Pearson’s r = 0.52, p < 0.001; ICC = 0.51, p < 0.001) [14]. This suggests that the potential of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) to assess adherence to the MedDiet is similar in both Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries.",68c74ad9-99cf-4d96-bad6-e6f71247db49
23,methods23," In contrast, relative agreement between the MedDiet score derived from the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and the MedDiet score derived from an FFQ was higher among heart and lung transplant patients in the UK (Pearson’s r = 0.72, p = 0.002; ICC = 0.64, 95% CI 0.31–0.85) [16]. Further, the absolute agreement between the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)- and food record-derived MedDiet scores in our study was lower than the moderate agreement (κ = 0.43) demonstrated between the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and an FFQ in Spain [14]. We acknowledge, however, that our sample size is considerably smaller than the >7000 participants assessed in the Spanish study and we may have suboptimal statistical power for some comparisons. With regard to individual dietary components of the MedDiet score, we found that concordance between the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and the food records was poor for 57.1% of components, compared to 21.",2309947d-7cbd-4381-8f09-a82db7473c9f
24,methods24,"4% and 28.6% in the Spanish [14] and German [15] validation studies of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) against an FFQ, respectively. Nevertheless, the present study showed that exact agreement (45.8%) within categories of the total MedDiet score between the dietary assessment methods under comparison was comparable to the Spanish study (47.9%) [14]. Classification into opposite categories of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and the reference instrument was higher in the current, compared to the Spanish, study (21.9 vs. 8.6%) [14], which might have resulted from the small sample size in our study. Overall, our findings suggest that the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) provides reasonable estimates to assign the same absolute MedDiet score ratings as the food records [29].",1191a6b1-6156-4f55-8731-49bd30fbc3ec
25,methods25,"  It should be noted, however, that comparisons of earlier studies with the current study should be undertaken with caution, due to the different reference instruments utilized to assess the accuracy of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). For example, the reference dietary assessment method in all earlier Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) validation studies was a full-length validated FFQ, assessing dietary habits over the previous 12 months [14,15,16]. Although FFQs have their own limitations [30], the reference period of one year in these earlier studies might have captured habitual dietary habits, as well as food items affected by seasonal variation, more accurately than the 3-day food record used in the current study.",3f1e9c34-4a15-469f-9aa1-ea92fb9dda69
26,methods26," Also, it has been suggested that when instruments assessing habitual diet, such as the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), are validated against food records, a certain degree of disagreement is to be expected, due to within-subject variations that naturally occur over the shorter reference period of the food record [17]. Further, because the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) has a similar design to an FFQ [14], comparing it against the latter will most likely overestimate its accuracy, due to similarities in measurement errors [17]. Specifically regarding the earlier research in England, it might also be that the specific health status of participants (individuals with already established disease) [16] encouraged them to give more accurate responses in both dietary assessment methods [17].",2f7d464e-44b6-467c-aa6d-378f29464b5e
27,methods27,"  Differences in the intakes of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) food components between the studies might also account for the observed differences in absolute agreement. For example, only 1% of participants in our sample met the criterion for olive oil intake by both the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and food records, compared to 70.9% and 63.9% of Spanish adults meeting this criterion by the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and FFQ, respectively [14]. These higher levels of olive oil intake in the Spanish study might have given greater power to observe strong evidence of agreement and might explain the poor agreement in some food components in our study. Nevertheless, we consider that testing the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)’ accuracy against food records is a strength of our study.",383e7cd6-e8cd-416d-a4ce-3fcb90d776a2
28,methods28," Although not free of error in assessing habitual dietary intake, food records have been suggested to be the preferred method of choice when validating instruments such as the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), as they tend to minimize errors related to recall and perceptions of portion sizes and, unlike FFQs, the measurement errors of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and food records are not correlated [17]. In addition, administering the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) prior to, and independently from, the reference instrument, is a strength of our study, as this sequence of administration minimises the risk of the training effect on diet recording (i.e., providing answers according to what was recorded on the reference instrument), and it is the procedure recommended for dietary validation studies [17]. However, the possibility remains for reactivity, i.e.",6e56327d-4b13-4374-a328-e19298a35b5b
29,methods29,", that participants eat differently during the 3 days of food recording because of completing the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire previously. To our knowledge, there is no study randomizing the order of completion of FFQ and food records to understand the possible effect of prior exposure to a brief tool. In general, reactivity within food records typically accounts for 10% of energy intake [31,32] and is observed across all food groups [33], suggesting that no specific effects on the overall Mediterranean diet score would be observed.  In the current study, participants who were in the highest tertile of MedDiet adherence, as indicated by the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MedDiet score, had higher intakes of olive oil, vegetables, total, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat and vitamin E, and lower intakes of red/processed meat and sugar-sweetened beverages, compared to participants in the lowest MedDiet adherence tertile.",8a1fa627-2035-40de-a223-1478d67cfce1
30,methods30," These findings are in agreement with the original validation study of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) in older Spanish adults [14]. The evidence for the association between the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MedDiet score and other foods and nutrients calculated from the food records was weak. However, all distributions were in the expected direction, suggesting that, in this respect, the English Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) provides acceptable levels of predictive validity and that it reflects the intake of specific foods and nutrients typical of the traditional MedDiet [34,35]. Despite the evidence for the beneficial role of the MedDiet on cardiometabolic risk factors [36,37,38,39], no associations were observed between the total Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MedDiet score and cardiometabolic, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements, probably because of suboptimal statistical power in our study.",c8663427-95e6-4ea5-8c8f-de9d4cfc8bbb
31,methods31," This is in contrast to the substantially larger Spanish study, which found that the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MedDiet score was inversely associated with Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, TG, total/high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and TG/high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratios, and was positively associated with high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol [14]. It might be that specific aspects of the UK diet (i.e., more processed foods, ready meals, savoury snacks and pastries, etc.) [24], which are not captured by the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), outweighed the benefits of adhering to some MedDiet components. It is also noteworthy that the mean Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MedDiet score in the current study was lower than the one observed in Spanish adults (5.47 vs. 8.68) [14].",8e56ce9c-0d8e-45e1-a1ed-88f44ffc9854
32,methods32," This lack of variation in the MedDiet score, in addition to the smaller sample size compared to the Spanish study, even if acceptable for a dietary validation study [17], contributed to our study not having adequate power to detect associations between the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)-derived MedDiet score and these variables. Considering the benefits of adhering to the MedDiet on Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, as demonstrated by the PREvencion con DIetaMEDiterranea (PREDIMED) study [9], the low overall adherence to the MedDiet among participants in the current study emphasises the need for the development of strategies to help individuals at high Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in the UK to adopt this health-promoting dietary pattern.",6bf02cd8-d0d8-4947-be27-37b6744192e5
33,methods33,"  Limitations of the study include the self-selection of older adults at high risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) as participants, who might already have made favourable changes to their diet, due to their knowledge of their risk. It is noteworthy, however, that participants had low adherence to the MedDiet, as indicated by both the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)- and food record-derived MedDiet scores, which suggests that further dietary changes could be made to improve health. Our findings might not be generalisable to younger, healthy adults, and further assessment among a more ethnically and socio-economically diverse sample would establish the English Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)’ wider utility potential. There is no reason to believe that dietary reporting would vary in other populations; however, further validation studies would confirm this.",d4606509-f47d-4273-a56c-f2be7b4292dc
34,methods34," Finally, the design of our study did not allow the assessment of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)’ ability to detect changes in MedDiet adherence and therefore, its potential utility in the evaluation of nutrition interventions aiming to promote the MedDiet. Nevertheless, the PREvencion con DIetaMEDiterranea (PREDIMED) study demonstrated that the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) can detect meaningful increases in MedDiet adherence following intervention [40], so there is good reason to believe the same would be true of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)’ English version.",22abe3d6-22f6-4d7a-bb83-1cc0c10c205a
35,methods35," Also, the observed stability of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), when examining its test-retest reliability, indicates that any observed differences in the MedDiet score derived by two consecutive administrations of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) would likely be the result of an intervention effect, instead of secular instability of the instrument [41]. However, evidence from an intervention study utilising the English version of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) to assess changes in MedDiet adherence, compared to a reference dietary assessment method, would help to confirm this.  5.",f6206ba7-c5ed-476c-aeef-131791531d81
36,methods36," Conclusions Despite the aforementioned limitations, in this sample of adults at high risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a non-Mediterranean country, the English version of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) provided an acceptable estimate of adherence to the MedDiet against the reference instrument of estimated food records, as well as reasonable rankings according to the derived MedDiet score. Further, the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) had good test-retest reliability, indicating that it is a reliable instrument for assessing MedDiet adherence over time.",c632cbfd-d5d0-4f02-8197-acdba1ca06c9
37,methods37," Considering the need to identify valid dietary assessment instruments that reduce burden for research participants and researchers, as well as patients and practitioners [12], the English Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) can therefore be used to rapidly assess adherence to the MedDiet and provide feedback to individuals wishing to make changes towards this dietary pattern in research and clinical practice.
