0,background0," Primary prevention trials have demonstrated that the traditional Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. However, this benefit has not been proven for secondary prevention after an acute coronary syndrome (acute coronary syndrome (ACS)). We hypothesized that a high-intensity Mediterranean diet intervention after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) decreases the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques by complex interactions between anti-inflammatory effects, microbiota changes and modulation of gene expression.

1,methods0," The MEDIMacute coronary syndrome (ACS) project is an academically funded, prospective, randomized, controlled and mechanistic clinical trial designed to address the effects of an active randomized intervention with the Mediterranean diet on atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability, coronary endothelial dysfunction and other mechanistic endpoints. One hundred patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are randomized 1:1 to a monitored high-intensity Mediterranean diet intervention or to a standard-of-care arm. Adherence to diet is assessed in both arms using food frequency questionnaires and biomarkers of compliance. The primary endpoint is the change (from baseline to 12 months) in the thickness of the fibrous cap of a non-significant atherosclerotic plaque in a non-culprit vessel, as assessed by repeated optical coherence tomography intracoronary imaging.",bcd222f9-646e-4db7-98df-c939ac41f1f8

3,discussion0," Diet is one of the main environmental factors triggering atherosclerosis and plaque progression. In fact, the current “American Dietary Guidelines’ Key Recommendations for Healthy Eating” recommends a Mediterranean-style pattern as one of its three suggested healthy diet styles [43]. Moreover, when changes over time are assessed, improved adherence to the traditional Mediterranean-style pattern is strongly associated with reductions in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality [44]. On this basis, we have designed the MEDIMacute coronary syndrome (ACS) clinical trial to understand the mechanisms involved in diet-induced changes on anatomical and functional biomarkers of coronary atherosclerosis.  Several individual nutrients have been mechanistically associated with beneficial effects on the gastrointestinal tract microbiome. However, in contrast to the isolated single-nutrient approach, the MedDiet intervention is based on current paradigms of studying overall dietary patterns.",559d6a38-ff12-4e4b-bd51-1976c7be8184
4,discussion1," These have the advantage of taking into consideration the potential synergistic or antagonistic effects of different nutrients and better represent the dietary practices found in real-world diets [45]. The appropriateness of this intervention is also supported by well-established cardiovascular benefits in primary prevention. Although several large-scale trials using MedDiet interventions are currently ongoing, to the best of our knowledge, no trial is currently including patients in the subacute phase after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS).  Numerous molecular pathways have been involved in the beneficial effect of MedDiets, such as reduction in the expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecules and reduction of DNA synthesis in human coronary smooth muscle cell. However, the link between MedDiet and cardiovascular protection has not been fully elucidated.",908499a0-bb73-41bd-9ab5-6168319a68a7
5,discussion2," Remarkably, the interplay between diet, gut and oral microbiota and the temporal changes of plaque composition and vascular function—key agents in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis—remains largely unknown.  Clinical impact  The combination of a well-controlled experimental intervention and complex mechanistic objectives shall provide valuable insights into protective microbiota-mediated roles in the MedDiet. Moreover, the identification of specific microbial profiles related to cardiovascular health could help to design probiotic treatments―alone or in combination with food supplements―to improve their efficacy. In addition, microbiota-based diagnostic kits to personalize and monitor cardiovascular risk could be developed. In the future, tests of microbiota-mediated markers could identify individuals at a particular cardiovascular risk who should be prioritized for prevention.",59956a64-f592-4790-ad5b-5481a389ec0d
6,discussion3,"  Shifting dietary patterns and directions worldwide entails substantial economic and public health efforts that are frequently in overt conflict with the major stakeholders of food companies. Further demonstrating the efficacy of MedDiet for secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) may help to justify the need and opportunity of clinical interventions to promote adherence to this traditional diet. Furthermore, a comprehensive view of the biological processes triggered by diet nutrients could eventually lead to the design of diet modifications based on well-established biological pathways.  Limitations  Complying with basic ethical principles, the control group will receive standard-of-care diet recommendations which include several aspects of the MedDiet. Other alternatives, such as a low-fat diet, are associated with worse outcomes than MedDiet and would not be ethical to implement in a contemporary clinical trial [3].",23d9c6cb-254c-4d2d-a54c-f6ad0399eec1
7,discussion4," We recognize that, for the purpose of MEDIMacute coronary syndrome (ACS), adherence to MedDiet in the control group may blur the effect of the experimental intervention and decrease the power to detect differences between arms. However, it has been demonstrated that a personalized, professionalised and closely monitored high-intensity intervention is highly effective to promote adherence to traditional MedDiet, whereas general recommendations are much less powerful [20]. Therefore, we anticipate that true adherence to MedDiet specifications will be highly different between both groups. Nevertheless, primary and secondary endpoints will be analysed both by intention-to-treat and by a per-protocol basis. For this purpose, ad hoc biomarkers have been implemented and will provide investigators with robust metrics of diet adherence and efficacy.",14269d1e-00c1-4c82-85c3-8be6066a38e5
8,discussion5,"  The primary endpoint of the trial is based on intracoronary imaging, and therefore, an invasive catheterization procedure is required for obtaining this read-out. Because patients may refuse undergoing this second study, a 45% attrition has been pre-specified. A detailed plan to quantify compliance to MedDiet in both arms has been designed, including validated dietary self-reporting questionnaires and biomarkers. Biomarkers of compliance will be measured in random subset of participants from the two arms of the trial as a potential way of accommodating both systematic and random components of measurement error in dietary self-reporting.
