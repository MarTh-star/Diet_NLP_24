0,methods0,"2.1. Ethical Approval Ethical approval for this study was granted by Sheffield Hallam University’s Health and Wellbeing Research Ethics Committee (ethical approval code HWB-2016-17-S&E-43) and was conducted in accordance with the revised Declaration of Helsinki.  2.2. Participants Twenty-four individuals (MD = 12; VD = 12) provided written informed consent to participate in this research. Participants were recruited to each treatment arm (MD vs. VD) preintervention, to foster adherence and reduce attrition. Adherence and completion of dietary interventions can be an issue for some studies, particularly if a treatment requires participants to make large changes to their habitual eating habits, such as a vegan diet. We therefore recruited individuals motivated to participate in each arm pragmatically, which we identified through advertisement throughout the local region.",53ccbe8b-b580-438b-be31-fc249f027bb4
1,methods1," To achieve our low attrition rate, we used our ‘six pillars of adherence’ strategy (based upon ‘social support’, ‘education’, ‘reachability’, ‘small groups intervention implementation’, ‘reminders’, and ‘simplicity’), which we have used previously with excellent results in lifestyle interventions (i.e., over 90% of retention and 79% of completion) [22,23].  All participants were required to be aged between 18 and 35 years and be healthy and sedentary. We accounted for and excluded for all known risk factors that affect microcirculation, e.g., smoking, high blood pressure, unhealthy lipid profile, diabetes, and known cardiovascular or microcirculatory diseases during recruitment. Sedentariness was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) and defined as undertaking ≤60 minutes of structured/planned physical activity per week. Health status was assessed via a pre-test medical questionnaire.",d1aba77f-533e-4c9a-81da-b2bea0ba48ca
2,methods2," Habitual diet was evaluated by two 14-item questionnaires (one for the MD and VD) that measured food frequency. The 14-item MD questionnaire has been described elsewhere [24]. The 14-item VD questionnaire was developed for this study specifically and reflected the MD questionnaire in its format and calculation. A score of ≤ 6 for either questionnaire indicated low habitual adherence and was a criterion for inclusion. Female participants were studied specifically during days 1–7 of their menstrual cycle, to minimise the influence of cyclical changes in female sex hormones on our findings [25].  2.3. Dietary Intervention Participants were instructed to follow the diets for four weeks, with advice and guidance provided via email, face-to-face and/or telephone consultation throughout the intervention period. A three-day food diary was completed to assess changes in nutritional data pre and post intervention.

Participants were encouraged to follow the diets (Table 1) without restricting energy. The MD was based on the intervention developed by Estruch et al. [26]; the VD was developed based on the recommendations of Phillips [27]. Both groups were provided with resources, including guidance documents, shopping lists, and recipes prior to commencing their intervention. Food items were provided to assist adherence.   2.4. Anthropometric Assessments Participants’ measurements were assessed pre and post intervention using procedures highlighted elsewhere [28]. Body mass (kg) was measured using balance beam scales (Adam GFK 150H, Adam Equipment Co. Ltd., Milton Keynes; UK) to the nearest 0.05 kg. Stature (m) was measured using a wall-mounted stadiometer (Harpenden, UK) to the nearest 0.01 cm.",059a76ee-8742-44ea-89de-4beaef54a10f

Microvascular Assessments Microvascular blood flow was measured via Laser Doppler Flowmetry (Periflux system 5000, Perimed 122 AB, Järfälla, Sweden) using procedures previously described by our lab [18], and by Tew et al. [29]. Readers are advised to consult these articles for detailed descriptions of the LDF procedure.

13,methods20," Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the effects of two short-term dietary interventions on cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) and cholesterol levels in a young, sedentary population. This research offers new information about the effectiveness of the MD and VD to impact several important health markers, and highlights that changes can be observed in as little as four weeks of intervention. This work adds to previous research from our lab [18], and data could now be beginning to suggest that short-term dietary modifications are sufficient to positively impact some cardiovascular risk factors.  4.1. Vegan Diet Baseline data indicated that the groups’ habitual diets were comparable prior to intervention. Both treatments led to changes in dietary composition, and reductions in Saturated Fat and increases in Fibre were experienced by both groups.",6995d6dd-d1b4-4357-bd4b-575b65cfb2f7
14,methods21," VD participants experienced a noteworthy reduction in TC, reflecting data elsewhere suggesting that TC levels are malleable to dietary modification [2,31]. Indeed, our findings echo those of McDougall et al. [32], who found that a seven-day low-fat VD intervention led to reductions in TC. In contrast to McDougall’s study however our participants were not instructed to follow a low-fat diet (10% of total Calories), and consumed a mean intake of 73.7 g/day (≈ 36.6% of total Calories) via ad libitum feeding, suggesting that the reduction in TC we observed might not just be the result of lowering Total Fat alone. The VD participants reduced Saturated Fat intakes from 38.2 g/day (16.3% of total Calories) to 14.6 g/day (7.2% of total Calories), which, when coupled with increases in soluble fibre (∆ fibre = 17.19 g ± 10.83), perhaps due to the increases in Vegetables, Fruits, and Legumes consumed (Table 3), might explain the reduction in TC we observed [2,28].",c9a87165-dd0c-4eca-8b15-b9284bb82566
15,methods22," It should be noted that the increase in legume consumption, whilst a large increase (VD ∆ Legumes = 191.2 ± 148.3), did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, these changes were not observed in the MD group, who did not adjust their Saturated Fat and Fibre intakes (nor increase fibre, grain, and legumes consumed) to the extent of the VD participants.  The health benefits of consuming adequate dietary fibre are beginning to be understood, specifically in the prevention and treatments of conditions such as type II diabetes, Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colon cancer [33,34]. In this study, the VD group increased their Fibre intake from 20.5 g/day to 37.7 g/day, and the MD group from 20.8 g/day to 26.9 g/day (∆ Fibre was notably greater in the VD group).",e36ae21b-d3ca-4e19-a9b3-51e74465a732
16,methods23," Such increases could impact health, and future research could investigate long-term health effects of novel high-fibre diets, such as a VD or MD, for a variety of health markers sensitive to its intake, such as glycaemia and lipids [33,34]. Indeed, it is likely that the changes we observed in the VD group, such as reduced TC and weight loss, are at least partially explained by this shift in dietary composition [2,4,16,17,32,34].  Both groups ate less as a result of their diets (∆ Calories = −220 kcal/day for MD participants; −296 kcal/day for VD participants) despite being instructed to maintain energy consumption. The VD participants experienced weight loss (VD ∆ body mass = −1.0 kg; MD ∆ body mass = 0.17 kg), which was not an expected outcome of this research.",8d580bac-de28-42d2-93ba-e7993122bbf3
17,methods24," While we cannot rule out that participating in a dietary intervention might prompt some participants to eat less, our findings appear to be consistent with research elsewhere highlighting weight loss associated with vegan diets [35]. Interestingly, this weight loss occurred following reductions in protein (VD ∆ Protein = −29.8 g/day) and fat (VD ∆ Total Fat = −23.47 g/day), and the increase in fibre (VD ∆ Fibre = 17.19 g/day). Data indicates that hypocaloric protein-rich diets assist weight loss due to their satiating properties [36]. Similar benefits have also been reported for high-fibre diets [37]. The VD group experienced their weight loss despite consuming less protein; increases in fibre therefore might have offset any possible reductions in satiety following the reduction in protein [37], and facilitated this weight loss.",2bb6a9dc-cbda-4f79-8b10-f7a3c4724cd1
18,methods25," Whilst we did not measure satiety specifically, future research could investigate the satiety effects of a hypocaloric vegan diet, and research into possible weight-loss effects of vegan diets with various macronutrient (high vs. low protein, etc.) and fibre compositions in comparison to other dietary approaches.  It should be noted, however, that the VD group experienced marked reductions in a number of important micronutrients, including Iodine (∆ Iodine = −150.2) and Vitamin B12 (∆ Vitamin B12 = −4.0) by following their intervention. Such sizeable reductions should be of concern to individuals who adopt a vegan diet, as poor micronutrient status can have severe health implications over the long term.",2d23a559-8fd9-404d-8ac7-1010ab9b4d02
19,methods26," We provided participants with a Vitamin B12 supplement to offset an expected reduction in Vitamin B12 intake, however future studies might need also to be cognisant of the potential for other micronutrients, such as Sodium, Chloride, Phosphorous, Iodine, and Riboflavin to be reduced significantly too; and to offer suitable strategies to recompense for a reduced intake, if warranted.  4.2. Mediterranean Diet Measuring microvascular reactive function via LDF facilitates the evaluation of endothelial health [21]. The endothelium is a selectively-permeable vascular interface between blood and tissue [21]. Endothelial dysfunction is characterised by diminished vasodilation and reduced nitric oxide supply, and is a precursor to Cardiovascular disease (CVD) [3]. Emerging data highlights that lifestyle modifications can improve endothelial function [7,18,19,20]. Our findings add to this evidence, and similar to Klonizakis et al.",db454960-15bc-41bc-a144-26d12c067697
20,methods27," [19] and Alkhatib and Klonizakis [20], we observed improvements in microvascular function in response to following the MD. In our study, baseline cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was similar for both groups. However, following the four-week intervention, MD participants experienced improvements in plateau raw cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) that were not experienced by the VD group. This improvement in plateau cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) suggests that endothelial-mediated nitric oxide (NO) availability improved in response to the MD [38]. Impaired NO availability is characteristic of endothelial dysfunction, meaning that strategies that maintain or improve endothelial-NO levels are important in mitigating Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk [21,38,39].",070f37c5-5807-4ab7-b2a8-7576d53a22d8
21,methods28," Plant-based foods such as leafy green vegetables and beetroot are rich in dietary (inorganic) nitrates, and evidence demonstrates that dietary nitrates might increase NO levels via the nitrate-nitrate-nitric oxide pathway [39]. It is interesting therefore that the VD participants did not experience similar changes considering that the VD is wholly plant-based. However, it should be noted that we did not instruct participants to consume nitrate-rich foods specifically in this research, nor did we equate vegetable and fruit consumption between the groups, meaning that the differences in cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) data could be due to the MD group favouring the consumption of nitrate-rich vegetables. However, our findings confirm existing data elucidating the endothelial-health-promoting benefits of the MD [7,19,20], making this effect unlikely, and suggesting that the improvements observed in the MD group might be attributable to other dietary factors.",50792ce3-28e5-4a42-912b-2c10961b67ff
22,methods29,"  The MD promotes the consumption of Olive Oil, which possesses multiple health benefits due to its rich polyphenol content [40]. Indeed, participants who completed the MD intervention in this study increased their consumption of Olive Oil notably (MD ∆ Olive Oil = 17.7 ± 9.9), as it appeared that participants did not consume Olive Oil as part of their habitual diets prior to the commencement of this study. Interestingly, this increase in consumption was coupled with a concurrent decrease in Other Oils and Fats (MD ∆ Other Oils and Fats = −13.4 ± 20.4), suggesting that participants swapped their consumption of Other Oils and Fats for Olive Oil specifically. Extra virgin olive oil (in particular) has been shown to possess strong antioxidant properties due to its abundant polyphenol content (particularly oleuropein), and causal links are known to exist between oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and Cardiovascular disease (CVD) [39].",4bf4197c-0c17-4afe-9e3c-95ea63be2fd6
23,methods30," Olive oil is also rich in Oleic acid (an omega-9-monounsaturated fatty acid), which might reduce inflammation and improve metabolic and lipid health similarly [7,40]. It is possible therefore that such bioactive compounds augment the microvascular benefits of following the MD, and that the health effects of the diet are the result of a complex interplay between food elements. Indeed, making inferences about its mechanism of action are challenging given the complexity of its nutritive composition. Nevertheless, more research is necessary to investigate and isolate the health-promoting components of the MD, and other novel dietary strategies similarly.  Limitations of this research were a lack of randomisation, a small sample size with unequal numbers of male and female participants, and the short intervention period.",300d4f5d-6e2c-442e-8e48-d4cb70e726e8
24,methods31," However, in pilot studies that employ parallel-groups designs such as this research, sample sizes of 12 per group are considered to be appropriate, based on factors such as feasibility and precision around estimates to design further work [41]. Indeed, the purpose of this research is to inform further research, and our data features novel findings that should now inform larger, longer-term randomised controlled trials. Our approach to recruitment was pragmatic, and robust measures were taken to account for all known factors that affect microcirculation. We also tested female participants on specific days to minimise gender effects of sex hormone cycles. Therefore, whilst randomisation did not take place, we are confident that for the main area of interest in this research (microcirculation) the groups were balanced. Future research, however, might wish to isolate and investigate the effects of novel diets on the different genders specifically.",3983d88b-1d45-4263-bf07-6f9d22e95b47
25,methods32," It should also be noted that the intervention period of this study was intentionally short, to corroborate if meaningful improvements in microcirculatory health markers could be observed in as little as four weeks of intervention, reflecting data previously reported by our lab [42]. Elucidating these findings might help to define the prescription of specific diets in different populations, and our findings add to growing evidence in this area. The microcirculation effects we observed occurred within normal parameters of a young and healthy, sedentary population; however, these findings add to existing data from our lab, which indicate that short-term dietary interventions can elicit improvements in other populations similarly, and outside of normal parameters [19,20,42].",101dbedd-ec71-4c80-88fd-edc0777fecf5
26,methods33," Therefore, based upon our preliminary findings, this study could now help to inform the design and development of future, larger dietary intervention studies, and should serve as impetus for additional research in the areas discussed herein.   5. Conclusions This study highlighted the possible short-term health effects of following a four-week VD and MD intervention, revealing that the VD led to reduced TC and weight loss, and that the MD led to improvements in microvascular function (in general) and NO bioavailability (specifically) in a healthy sedentary population. While both diets promoted a micronutrient-rich diet, the health effects of the diets differed, suggesting that the nuances of each might offer different health outcomes when compared empirically. More research is necessary to elucidate and understand the possible health effects of such novel diets.
