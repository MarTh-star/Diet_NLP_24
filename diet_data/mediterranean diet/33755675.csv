0,introduction0," Pregnancy is a transcendent period for the mother and the fetus, characterized by an increase on energy requirements. Mediterranean diet (MD) is considered a healthy eating pattern that can provide the nutritional requirements of pregnancy and protect from the development of obstetric pathologies.  Objective  To know the relationship between adherence to the MD and its maternal-fetal benefits.  Methodology  A systematic review was conducted by identifying articles in the PubMed and Cochrane databases. The publication date of the studies was between 2010 and 2020, and the inclusion criteria established were that the articles were written in English and Spanish and were accessible in full text. Studies concerning assisted reproduction, gene modulation, conference abstracts, systematic reviews, and pilot studies were excluded. ",04da889a-fad0-4e74-9327-60f70ed772c4
1,methods0," A systematic review of the literature was carried out, following the PRISMA methodology (22) as a reference. The quality of each of the studies was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias (Risk of Bias (ROB)) tool (23), which includes seven items that analyze six domains of bias. This tool classifies the quality of articles into three levels: high, low, or unclear.  The first author (AZ-M) and the second author (NR-R) of the study rated each included article independently, and the discrepancies were resolved through an agreement with the third author (MS-S). Cohen’s kappa statistic was calculated to assess reliability among evaluators for the Risk of Bias (ROB) without elements that assessed the blinding of participants or evaluators, as all studies were rated as high Risk of Bias (ROB) by the two evaluators when all the elements were analyzed.",ee5a0904-beaa-408d-927c-566fa0fa31e8
2,methods1," Inter-evaluator reliability was analyzed using Cohen’s kappa statistic, obtaining an intraclass correlation coefficient (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)) value of 0.8.  Data Sources  To obtain the documents, electronic searches were carried out in the international databases PubMed and Cochrane Library.  Search Strategy  To obtain the documents, electronic searches were carried out during the months of October, November, and December 2020. We used the following keywords transformed into terms MeSH (Medical Subject Heading): “diet, Mediterranean,” “pregnancy,” “treatment adherence and compliance” combined with the Boolean operators AND and OR.

4,methods3,"  Selection of Articles  The selection of articles was made by reading the title and abstract of all articles resulting from the search in PubMed, and Cochrane. The quality of each study was independently evaluated by two authors, using the Crombie criteria adapted by Petticrew and Roberts. Disagreements were resolved by a third author.  The assess the quality of cross sectional studies (AXIS) (24) critical evaluation tool was used to assess the quality and Risk of Bias (ROB) in cross-sectional studies (Table 2). Randomized clinical trials were assessed using the PEDro tool (25) (Table 3). Finally, both the quality of the cohort studies (Table 4) and the quality of cases and controls were assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (26) (Table 4). For all scales, agreements were above kappa values of 0.75. The third and last authors (MS-S and AZ-M) rated each included article independently, and discrepancies were resolved by agreement with the second author (JH-S).",2d9f2c61-9b95-4bd9-83c9-2428897c086d
5,methods4, We also calculated the Cohen’s Kappa statistic to assess interrater realibility. The Cohen’s Kappa provides a level of agreement between two or more raters than is higher than chance. It is considered as moderate or substantial when values are above 0.6 (moderate) or 0.8–1 as substantial agreement (27).

Nine studies (18–20, 28, 29, 34–37), found positive maternal effects related to adherence to MD during pregnancy.  Gestational Diabetes  A total of five studies (18, 28, 29, 35, 37) obtained found that MD acts as a protective factor against the development of GD.  In three studies (18, 29, 37), MD was supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts.

Two studies analyzed the effect of MD consumption before pregnancy. One of the studies showed a decrease of 24% in the risk of developing GD (p = 0.004) when women followed an MD nutritional pattern before pregnancy (33). In addition, one study (28) found a protective effect of MD and low consumption of meat and derivatives on the development of GD (p = 0.028 for high adherence to MD and p = 0.005 for very high adherence) (28).  Healthy Lifestyle  Four studies (19, 20, 29, 35) analyzed the relationship between MD consumption during pregnancy and the healthy lifestyles during pregnancy. Results suggested that mothers with adherence to MD gained less gestational weight (29, 35).",1aa3f4cf-2ea9-4d5b-a851-69aad0fcad8d
25,results17," Also, women with a strong preconception adherence to MD gained less weight during pregnancy (20). A cross-sectional study conducted by Flor-Alemany et al. (19) showed that greater adherence to MD was associated with better sleep quality during weeks 16–34 of gestation, especially among sedentary pregnant women (p < 0.05).  Complications of Childbirth  Two studies (29, 36) associated MD consumption with reduced complications during childbirth.  First, in the cohort study conducted by Saunders et al. (36), it was hypothesized that adherence to MD decreases the risk of preterm birth but they only found relevant results in overweight or obese women (p < 0.01).  In addition, in the second study (29), it was found that women who had followed an MD pattern were less likely to give birth by emergency Cesarean section as well as a lower probability of perineal trauma during childbirth (both, ps = 0.001).",1b6bf4b6-ab96-4d97-82ae-c17a74ccba91
26,results18," This reduction could be due to improvements in the evolution of childbirth or also to the reduction in the number of newborns with macrosomia (29).  Urinary Tract Infections  In two studies, high adherence to MD was found to reduce the risk of UTIs during pregnancy. This relationship (p = 0.001) was found in the research of Assaf-Balut et al. (18, 29), and this result may be due to the relationship between MD, inflammation, and immunomodulation. This effect is possibly due to the presence of some food components, such as phenolic compounds and oleic acid (29).  Fetal Growth  Finally, one study (37) found a significant association between maternal adherence at the beginning of pregnancy to a high content of fish and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and a dietary pattern low in meat (characteristic food of the Mediterranean diet), with increased fetal growth. An increase in embryonic volume was also found, with percentages of 20.4% at 7 weeks and 14.4% at 11 weeks (34).",76a575f7-3db2-4ed0-bfbf-7161183cc366

34,results27,"	  Birth Weight  Three studies (18, 29, 30) found a relationship between maternal adherence to MD and birth weight. In particular, it was found that MD reduced the probability of low birth weight (18, 29) and that the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) component and the presence of macrosomia was essential to control the low birth weight (35) because the risk of macrosomia is inversely associated with diets of low glycemic index, a characteristic of MD. The risk of newborns with low weight is a consequence of placental insufficiency. In this sense, MD supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and nuts could play a fundamental role in improving placental flow and, therefore, decreased intrauterine growth retardation (29).  Prematurity  Maternal adherence to MD was associated with a significant reduction in the rates of preterm infants (18, 29).  Gastroschisis  In a study by Cánovas-Conesa et al.",5aa83edb-93ed-4793-bf50-fd7ccae81cbb
35,results28," (32), it was observed that adherence to MD, rich in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and vegetables, helped to prevent the risk of vascular occlusion and risk of gastroschisis.  Problems in Childhood  The relationship between maternal adherence to MD and health in children’s development was analyzed in three studies (21, 31, 33). First, the cohort study of Chatzi et al. (21) revealed that increased adherence to MD at early gestation was associated with lower adiposity levels (BMI 0.14 units lower, arm crease thickness 0.63 mm lower, and abdominal circumference 0.39 mm lower), leptin (reflecting lower fat and lower triglyceride levels in childhood) and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in children. According to the authors, this may be due to the effect of MD’s low glycemic index and its high antioxidant content, which can lead to better fetal glucose metabolism and better metabolic function and, finally, influence the individual’s susceptibility to weight gain in childhood (21).",eeb50b3d-0fb6-479f-aba3-f6ff98fcf07e
36,results29,"  In addition, in the research conducted by Steenweg-de Graaff et al. (33), an association was found between the consumption of MD during pregnancy and a lower risk of developing behavioral problems in childhood, specifically, externalizing problems (attention problems and aggressive behavior) (p = 0.006), whereas the traditional Dutch diet favored the development of these problems (p = 0.011) by Steenweg-de Graaff et al. (33).  Finally, the study of Melero et al. (31) found a relationship between maternal intake of MD and reduced risk of hospitalization in children up to 2 years of age. However, this relationship was stronger in women with a pregestational BMI < 25 kg/m2 and normal glucose tolerance (p < 0.05) (31). ",a66ae3c5-f6fc-4d3f-9957-f7b75ca32aa9
37,discussion0," The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to study the effects of the MD during the gestational period both on the mother and the fetus. A total of 14 studies were analyzed. The results showed that the MD was associated with the reduction of some pathologies of pregnancy, such as GD, overweight or obesity, complications of childbirth, UTIs, alterations of fetal growth, and sleep quality; as well as perinatal problems, including birth weight, prematurity, gastroschisis, and other childhood problems. These results may be due to the relationship between MD, inflammation, and immunomodulation. This effect is possibly a consequence of the presence of some food components, such as phenolic compounds and oleic acid (29). Some previous studies have suggested that some foods such as nuts or olive oil may facilitate weight loss and may have potential effects on insulin sensitivity and inflammation (38).",dd6a3bc5-56f1-4b71-8436-75d741d52794
38,discussion1," Also, the MD has potential antioxidant effect given their high levels of lutein, β-carotene, and γ-tocopherol (39) improving the inflammatory cytokine profiles.  Likewise, the results of this study show that MD favors a decrease in complications during pregnancy, as it is related to a lower risk of preterm delivery (32), emergency Cesarean sections, and perineal trauma (29). Also, adherence to MD promotes adequate fetal growth (34) because this type of diet provides the nutrients necessary for the correct development of the fetus (34). As for the newborn, MD intake during pregnancy has been shown to be a protective factor linked to a decrease in the number of hospitalizations (31), a lower risk of gastroschisis (32), a decrease in attention problems and aggressiveness (33), as well as a lower risk of developing cardiometabolic complications, such as hypertension or obesity (21), a lower risk of prematurity (18, 29), and adequate birth weight (18, 29, 30).",869d9dba-ca36-449d-b279-1598f9e2e7da
39,discussion2,"  These results are similar to those obtained in other systematic reviews. For example, Biagi et al. (40) and Amati et al. (41) found a positive effect between adherence to MD during pregnancy and children’s health. Hassani Zadeh et al. showed that following an MD pattern during pregnancy is beneficial both for the mother and the offspring, and also showed that the MD can potentially decrease the risk of suffering from atopia in the offspring and GD in the mother (42), results that are highly consistent with our study. In particular, MD is associated with a lower incidence of asthma/allergic diseases in childhood, although further studies would be needed to clarify this relationship (38). The beneficial effects of MD had also been associated with health parameters, including improved glycemic control, a reduction in insulin use during pregnancy, a decreased risk of newborns with macrosomia (43), and better control of blood pressure.",5475cbe5-fb0d-455f-aaa5-f7d29b89206f
40,discussion3," Eating patterns before and during pregnancy characterized by a high intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, olive oil, and a low intake of red meat and processed meats have been associated with an increased risk of hypertension during pregnancy. Although the biological mechanisms by which MD plays a protective role are not precisely known, these findings could indicate that the consumption of unsaturated fatty acids and micronutrients as well as some bioactive compounds make this diet help prevent complications during pregnancy (44).  Due to the beneficial effects of the MD, some authors highlight the need to recover the MD pattern in the general population and, in particular, in pregnant women, to avoid overweight and obesity, problems during pregnancy, as well as to achieve an adequate weight gain, as all this is related to overweight and the increase in adiposity in the offspring (40, 41, 44, 45).",5702addc-4802-452c-badf-293c6df81ce0
41,discussion4,"  The present work presents several limitations that require future areas of research. First, the wide variety in the design of the included studies, the variability of the strength of association in different health outcomes, and the presence of studies that used a small sample size limit the conclusions. In addition, the search only included publications in English and Spanish; therefore, not all current evidence to date may be represented. Thirdly, the data sources used for this review were PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane Library. Fourthly, the intervention was performed at different times of gestation, which may affect the robustness of the results and conclusions. Also, there is a bias of quality and selection of articles that, despite having been reduced to the maximum, is still inherent in this type of study.",d0be9c5a-03b4-4040-930a-871246ca42f2
42,discussion5," And finally, there is high variability in the type of intervention performed, in the method of collecting data, and in the foods that constitute MD in each region, which can make it difficult to compare their effectiveness. However, this study has strengths; for example, it is one of the few reviews existing in the literature, where the relationship of the MD is analyzed in an applied way not only in pregnancy, but also in the offspring. This study provides also evidence about the beneficial effect of the MD in the reduction of some pathologies of pregnancy including: sleep problem, gastroschiis, alteration in fetal growth and prematurity. In addition, we examined the quality of studies using three independent tool. We found that most studies (80%) described main areas of bias in controlled clinical studies including: eligibility criteria, allocation, randomization, measurement of drop outs, measures of at least one key outcome, results between group.",74258271-ff2f-4433-a3a2-c66e77e6ff49
43,discussion6," However, few studies were described as double-blind or the blinding method was inappropiated. Future studies should be carried out controlling the Risk of Bias (ROB) of studies. Finally, future longitudinal studies should be carried out with a large sample to obtain strongly conclusive data evidencing the need to promote adherence to the MD in this population, working not only with pregnant women but with the family as a whole. In this regard, more studies on health promotion and prevention are needed to improve the health of pregnant women and their families.  Conclusion  The MD is optimal to ensure an adequate supply of nutrients during pregnancy. It provides all the energy and nutrients required to allow fetal growth and development, protecting from the development of obstetric pathologies including complications of childbirth, infections and alteration in fetal growth.",cd40e845-ce38-411e-b003-2c4ccbd82379
44,discussion7," The MD diet also can prevent some maternal complications such as diabetes, sleep quality and overweight or obesity. Given the available evidence of changes affecting women’s health during pregnancy, it is necessary to follow an adequate diet during gestation. Therefore, strategies to promote adherence to MD can be of considerable importance for public health given that MD may play a protective role in maternal and fetal health during the gestational period.
