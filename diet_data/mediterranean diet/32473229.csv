0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Setting  The overall design of the study is represented in Figure 1. The MED4Youth study is a multicenter single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial with obese and overweight adolescents (13–17 y) from Italy, Portugal, and Spain, in which an MD-based intervention will be compared to a traditional low-fat diet intervention. The three centers involved in the study obtained the approval of the Ethics Committee of each institution: (1) Eurecat (study coordinator): Institut d’Investigació Sanitària Pere i Virgili (Ref. CEIM: 210/2020); (2) UNIPR: Area Vasta Emilia Nord (Area Vasta Emilia Nord (AVEN)) Ethical Committee (pre-approval Ref. Prot. 28638); (3) UC: Ethics Committee of Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra and Portuguese National Data Protection Commission (Ref. Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra (CHUC)-197-20). MED4Youth study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04719052).",458ec430-734e-4c2a-8577-94a1c77bbc70
1,methods1," The protocol conformed to the Helsinki Declaration and Good Clinical Practice guides of the International Conference of Harmonization. This study followed the CONSORT criteria.  According to the sample size calculations, a total of 240 volunteers from Italy, Portugal, and Spain will be recruited for this study (80 participants per country).  The Spanish subjects will be recruited by Eurecat in the province of Tarragona, the Portuguese subjects will be recruited by the Hospital Pediátrico de Coimbra, and the Italian subjects will be recruited by the Pediatric Clinic of the Maternal and Child Department of the Parma University Hospital. The 80 individuals recruited in each country will be randomly assigned to either a MD group (n = 120, n = 40 per country), which will be instructed to follow an MD that will incorporate sourdough bread, hummus, pomegranate, and mixed nuts, or a Control group (n = 120, n = 40 per country), which will be assigned to a standard low-fat diet.",1bcaf46b-d186-4b41-8213-1b9acc52b8f7
2,methods2," The intervention duration is 4 months for each participant, including 3 visits. A follow-up visit after 4 months from the end of the intervention will be carried out.  The randomization code will be computer-generated using software (Geoffrey C. Urbaniak and Scott Plous, Lancaster, PA, USA). Furthermore, the unit responsible for the randomization will be separate from the study researchers.  For ethical reasons, a control group with no treatment against obesity will not be included, since a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials for the treatment of overweight in children clearly demonstrates that control groups, whether wait listed or only given written information, consistently gained weight (2.1% increase in percentage overweight post treatment and 2.7% post follow-up) [40]. Due to the nature of the study, the participants cannot be blinded to the intervention, although the investigators who will perform the sample and data analysis will be.  2.2.",83251c49-9b71-43fe-92aa-e0b0a86cc2e5

5,methods5," First of all, the total energy requirements of adolescents will be calculated by using the Molnar equation [41], and the level of physical activity will be obtained from the validated Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A). Afterwards, a caloric restriction of 20% will be applied to design a personalized diet for each obese individual (body mass index (BMI) ≥95th percentile) [42], while caloric restriction will be carefully evaluated for each individual with great overweight (body mass index (BMI) ≥90 to <95th percentile). For ethical issues, adolescents will not be conscious about caloric restriction of their diet, but only about dietary recommendations to follow the specific diet. In addition to the volunteer’s energy requirements, diets will take into account their food preferences and culture.",71598ac4-043d-4472-9232-a299e82a5594

The dietary prescription will be also easily accessible by both adolescents and their parents through an educational web-application developed by UNIPR partner. In addition, parents will be provided with a daily recipe to facilitate the adherence to the dietary prescription as well as to increase their culinary skills and the engagement in the project. Moreover, in each country, some recipes will be traditional of another country, i.e., a Spanish recipe in Italy or an Italian plate in Portugal.",0d414327-653c-41d3-82bd-19903bd3fb5e

Accordingly, this diet will provide a high amount of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, fiber, and phenolic compounds [44]. The MD will be based on the one proposed as MD in the PREDIMED study [45], providing 40–45% of energy from carbohydrate, 35–40% from fat, and 15–20% from protein. Special attention will be paid to the benefits of whole and minimally processed foods, traditional food vs. fast food, and seasonal products.",29c5dcfd-7028-40e5-8804-8d906e3d0197
8,methods8," Within the MD pattern, the intervention group (MD) will consume a sourdough bread and 3 specific foods from the Mediterranean basin with proven healthy effects (pomegranate juice, chickpeas/hummus, and mixed nuts) (Table 1).  In summary, adolescents in the MD group will replace the intake of conventional bread by sourdough bread consumption (2 servings of 50–60 g daily), they will incorporate into their diet chickpeas (2 servings of 150 g/week chickpeas, a minimum of one of them being hummus), while they will consume at least another serving of legumes, which can be chickpeas or another legume, and will consume pomegranate juice (4 servings of 200 mL/week) and mixed nuts (4 servings of 30 g/week). The sourdough bread will be a multigrain leavened with Rebola sourdough, which has been previously shown to elicit a lower increase in postprandial blood glucose levels and to decrease the inflammatory marker MCP-1 in rats when compared to a conventional white bread [35].",3d9882cc-d8f9-4227-9f78-f68db581d0fe
9,methods9," The squeezed pomegranate will be a single-strength juice. It will be squeezed with the arils, seeds, and inner and outer shell in order to get the important polyphenols existing in the fruit. Chickpeas are a popular pulse rich in protein and dietary fiber and will be consumed boiled and as hummus (paste of chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, lemon, and herbs).  (2) The low-fat diet (control diet) consists of a restricted consumption of fats. This diet will be based on the one proposed as low-fat diet in the PREDIMED study [45], and it will provide 55% of energy from carbohydrate, 25–30% from fat, and 15–20% from protein. The low-fat diet is the most used diet for obesity treatment in adolescents [42]. This group will not receive any additional specific food by the researchers.

Among the group-specific educational contents (MD or control diet), one topic will be available per each intervention week (16 weeks) with weekly release. In addition, a “welcome” content will be also available at the beginning of the study. Based on the topic of the week, the quiz game will be composed by 15 multiple-choice questions per week: 2 questions per day plus one final general question. The user should answer the right option to move to the next question/level (only two attempts will be available for each question per day), and every week, a new level will be available.

In addition, the application will be used to deliver the personalized dietary plan designed by a dietitian/nutritionist and to collect data during the intervention study by means of 3-day food diaries and questionnaires. Information on healthy diet and nutrition will also be provided to the parents through the app to help them support their kids. In addition, parents will be able to browse the “recipe of the day” to find everyday a new recipe helping them to prepare tasty and nutritious meals, and they will also have access to the weekly educational contents and to the diet of their children.  2.6.

The breads will be provided to the volunteers at no cost, and an extra amount of breads will be given for the rest of family in order to increase compliance.  Chickpeas/hummus and pomegranate juice will be sent by Shikma Field Crops to each center and will be provided to the MD group. Chickpeas/hummus and pomegranate will be sent several times during the study.

Within each group (MD and low-fat diet), changes from baseline will also be analyzed at the end point by a paired t test. Within each group (MD and low-fat diet), changes from baseline will also be analyzed considering the different time points using a general linear model for repeated measures. All statistical analyses will be performed with SPSS Statistics (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), setting the level of statistical significance at bilateral 5%. For metagenomics analysis, the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test will be performed to elucidate pairwise differences on bacteria relative abundance among dietary groups.",98df698c-9a8e-49d2-8599-de3cba6a0e84

Multivariate Data Analysis  For the NMR metabolomics analyses in feces, multivariate modeling will be performed in MATLAB (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA), using in-house scripts as previously described [57]. Briefly, it will firstly include a principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) to identify clusters and outliers, followed by pairwise comparisons between dietary groups using an orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to identify discriminatory metabolites. Colors projected onto an OPLS coefficient plot will indicate the correlation coefficient (r2) between each metabolite and grouping variable, with red indicating strong significance and blue indicating weak significance.",936b81b9-568a-47cb-aa57-32ca62cdf3e9

Data will be standardized as z-scores across samples for each metabolite and microbial genera before clustering so that the mean will be 0 and the SD will be 1.  For clustering identification, a multivariate approach based on principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), including the anthropometric and biochemical parameters, food intake biomarkers and phenolic metabolites, gut-derived metabolites, and bacterial genus abundances will be carried out after data normalization and autoscaling.  2.9.3.",6e88b40a-8990-4f32-b7cf-ee6da46c9c5f

The system biology approach will allow gaining a detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which the MD intervention exert its effects and to identify a combination of biomarkers that accurately characterizes the changes induced by the MD intervention. The integration of the anthropometric and biochemical data, metagenomics, and metabolomics will be based on mixDIABLO (http://mixomics.org/mixdiablo/ (accessed on 20 December 2020)), which is an integrative method to identify multi-omics biomarker panels that can discriminate between multiple phenotypic groups.",b3f0b62a-ec4e-4f0a-91ea-c0ab9e5c8900

Discussion  The identification of lifestyle factors, including adoption of dietary patterns, to counteract the troubling youth obesity epidemic, is of primary importance. However, it is still unclear which strategies or combination of strategies are effective in different contexts across the globe for obesity prevention in young people. In this framework, the MED4Youth project will develop, for the first time, a multicenter nutritional intervention study to evaluate the health benefits of the MD against youth obesity and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.",0d50bc89-c12a-4b0f-ba3e-44758b291fe3
26,methods26,"  The novelty of the MED4Youth project relies on, firstly, carrying out a multicenter clinical and nutritional intervention study for 4 months, including ICT educational tools, specifically targeting 240 obese adolescents (13–17 years) from different Mediterranean countries (Spain, Portugal, and Italy), and, secondly, the application of omics technologies and a systems biology approach to elucidate whether the MD could shape the gut microbiota and gut-derived metabolites, trying to pinpoint the mechanisms by which MD exert its beneficial effects against youth obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.",1fb552ac-a9b1-4480-8f28-5979c55d92a9
27,methods27,"  Moreover, the MED4Youth project will contribute to valorizing Mediterranean products, especially foods not widely consumed in European Mediterranean developed countries (sourdough bread, hummus, and pomegranate), promoting their consumption in the overall population, especially in adolescents, and paving the way for a high, long-term demand of these products, fostering the competitiveness of processing industries and reinforcing local production systems.  Another strong point of this intervention study is that subjective, conventional dietary assessment tools will be combined with targeted metabolomics analyses of selected food intake biomarkers to provide a more accurate fingerprinting of individuals’ dietary pattern. This will allow establishing robust associations between MD adherence and health status.",d675d558-10b1-4d34-a0a2-ae65372f8b95
28,methods28," In addition, the analysis of the inter-individual differences associated with particular biomarkers of intake of some plant products and phenolic classes will serve to assess the true internal exposure to certain bioactive compounds. This personalized approach will represent a step forward toward improving dietary exposure evaluation, allowing a more objective and robust assessment of the dietary pattern of the adolescent.  On the other hand, the multidisciplinary consortium will allow exchanging best practices among Mediterranean basin countries regarding adherence to MD, creating a common knowledge and understanding on how MD can be effective toward preventing youth obesity, fostering long-lasting results and supporting policies to prevent and ameliorate obesity across the Mediterranean basin.",3abb4c0c-f8cd-4dda-93c7-979703506fe4
29,methods29,"  MD is characterized by a high palatability, the use of herbs and spices, and the election of traditional culinary techniques, and this will facilitate adherence to the intervention and will increase long-term compliance, in contrast to most of the low-calorie diets prescribed these days, which are less tasty and difficult to follow, especially in the long term. However, there is a low adherence to MD among the youth population of different Mediterranean countries, with around 10% of adolescents showing a medium–high adherence and 21% present a low adherence to this diet (low adherence 0–3 points/12; medium adherence 4–7 points/12; high adherence: 8–12 points/12) [20,21]. Therefore, there is a clear interest in identifying palatable healthy foods to try to increase the adherence to MD.",2837f2fa-ae50-4087-ad01-e61ddb5709e8
30,methods30," Thus, in the present project, some traditional Mediterranean foods are proposed to the volunteers of all the centers, which are all characterized by a healthy nutrient profile and still very palatable, namely nuts, chickpeas/hummus, and sourdough bread. In particular, the bread will be made with flours from ancestral cereals and cereals with a lower gluten content, with a higher fiber content, and a lower carbohydrate content than conventional fast-fermenting bread made with white wheat. The inclusion of sourdough bread is based on previous scientific research that showed improved nutritional quality and beneficial effects on health with respect to the use of conventional breads, through the induction of satiety, a better control of the glycemic and insulinemic responses, the attenuation of systemic inflammation, and a favourable modulation of the gut microbiota [59,60,61,62].",7f171006-f6e7-45aa-af7f-f6d4b91effc9
31,methods31," Nuts, hummus/chickpeas, and pomegranate juice are rich sources of different bioactive compounds with putative cardioprotective effects that can contribute to reducing obesity, such as MUFA, PUFA, fiber, vitamins E and C, and different phenolic compounds [35,63,64,65]. There is strong evidence pointing towards a beneficial impact of nuts consumption on different cardiovascular risk factors, while their intake has been reported to help in the process of weight loss [66].  Moreover, different studies suggest that hummus and chickpeas may play a beneficial role in weight management and glucose control, as well as have a positive impact on some markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [38,63].",43bebb06-1e53-4978-81cf-2c73a6453187
32,methods32," Finally, pomegranate and pomegranate juice are a rich source of polyphenolic compounds, which have shown several beneficial effects on human health [67], could positively impact the gut microbiota, and have been shown to contribute the modulation of metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, which is typically associated to obesity [35,36,37]. Pomegranate juice intake has also been related with improvements on endothelial function in adolescents [68]. In the MED4Youth project, pomegranate will be consumed as pomegranate juice (delivered in frozen form) in order to facilitate and ensure its intake in the volunteers.  Some psychologists emphasize the importance of creating new habits, changing people in their daily context, influencing their habits and their basic psychology, rather than following traditional approaches based on simply providing information and education, to achieve a sustained change in behavior that has a beneficial impact on health [69,70].",5ccbfc01-b7aa-40fc-89c0-c67c39b1909f
33,methods33," Related with this issue, the MED4Youth project targets adolescence (13–17 y) as a key and sensitive development stage of life, where healthy lifestyles and behavioral flexibility need to be reinforced. For this reason, obese adolescents will be provided with an educational web-application where they can learn about health, nutrition, and food in general. Moreover, the motivational interview, using a nonjudgmental, empathetic, and encouraging tone, has shown to favor behavior change in adolescents, including the adoption of healthy dietary habits [44,53]. For this reason, the motivational interview used in the MED4Youth project will be focused on behavioral change, motivation for change, and no confronting.  Some potential limitations need to be taken into account. First, while volunteers in the MD group will receive some foods to be included in their diet, volunteers in the control group will not, so adherence to the low-fat control diet may be lower.",70637179-9167-4996-a74e-71d95632799a
34,methods34," Second, due to the nature of the interventions, participants and dietitians/nutritionists cannot be blinded, although researchers who will perform all biochemical and -omics determinations as well as statistical analyses will be. Another limitation is the short follow-up period (4 months) that might limit conclusions on the long-term effects. On the other hand, the major strengths of the study can be listed: (a) this is the first large RCT to evaluate the health benefits of the MD against youth obesity and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, with a total of 240 volunteers; (b) this is a multicentric study carried out in three different Mediterranean countries, which facilitates the generalization of the conclusions achieved from this study; (c) adherence in both groups will be fostered through the availability of an educational web-application intended to be used by both parents and adolescents,",08347671-e133-4b29-8e59-7a0059ddceaf
35,methods35," which provides information related to health and nutrition as well as recipes, and that will allow a “learning-through-playing” approach; (d) the use of food intake biomarkers provides an objective assessment of adherence to dietary interventions and a robust measurement of the dietary pattern of the volunteers; and (e) the application of omics technologies and a systems biology approach, together with the wide range of biomarkers analyzed, will provide a significant progress in the current knowledge on the mechanisms implicated in the beneficial effects of MD as well as the role of gut microbiota in these effects.  4.",c2feeb1f-f2e3-4b35-bd46-4b2db966e288
36,methods36," Conclusions  The MED4Youth project aims at determining whether an MD-based intervention including sourdough bread and healthy Mediterranean foods (chickpeas, humus, mixed nuts, and pomegranate juice) is more effective than a standard low-fat diet to tackle youth obesity, by conducting a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 240 overweight and obese adolescents from Spain, Portugal, and Italy. The dietary interventions will also include ICT educational tools. The scientific data derived from this project, especially those generated by the application of omics technologies, are expected to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms implicated in the beneficial effects of MD against youth obesity and the associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks factors, as well as the role of the gut microbiota. The MED4Youth project will help to establish an effective intervention for obese adolescents and therefore will help to prevent adult obesity and its comorbidities.",6755a0ad-9c7f-4c3a-a905-de4380040c97
37,methods37," Public health policies for obesity prevention could also be supported by the results of this project.  Further studies on larger cohorts would be crucial for the validation of the health biomarkers analyzed in the MED4Youth project in order to clearly demonstrate the underlying mechanisms behind the effects of MD against youth obesity and the associated risk factors. Moreover, on the basis of the results obtained through the analysis of food intake biomarkers in the present study, future studies could be designed to unravel which specific foods or bioactive compounds present in the MD are involved in the beneficial effects described for this dietary pattern.
