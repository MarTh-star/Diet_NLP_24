0,methods0," Design: We evaluated the implementation and effectiveness of the Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) program using a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness design, 21 and a single arm, pre-/post-study design. In a type 3 hybrid design, the primary research aim is to determine the impact of an implementation strategy, with a secondary aim of assessing clinical outcomes associated with implementation. Type 3 hybrid designs are used in implementation studies when there are concerns that the intervention may not be delivered with fidelity in real world settings. In Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE), this hybrid design fits with the focus on implementation of an evidence-based intervention adapted for Community Health Workers (CHW) delivery in rural public health settings and populations.  The University’s Non-Biomedical Institutional Review Board (Institutional Review Board (IRB)) approved and monitored the study.",88bf4465-a760-43da-ada5-d200cdeb1f60
1,methods1," This phase of the study was approved in January 2016 and direct interaction with study participants ended in August 2019. Participants were recruited from a Federally Qualified Health Center (Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)) and Local Health Department, and all participants provided written informed consent. Participants enrolled at the Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) also provided consent for study staff to obtain cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related lab values from their medical record by signing a separate Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)) consent form. No medical record information was gathered for participants enrolled at the local health department.",9db92088-f579-4922-af33-b3a75c84b04e
2,methods2,"  The Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) Intervention: Details of the Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) intervention have been previously published 18 and are briefly described here and in Table 1. Three Community Health Workers (CHW)s delivered an adapted version of the evidence-based Heart-to-Health lifestyle intervention 18 and referred participants to community and clinical resources. During the first year of study, we engaged community stakeholders in adapting the intervention to fit an underserved, rural, and predominantly African American population. As reported elsewhere, 17 we adapted the intervention to fit delivery by Community Health Workers (CHW)s who would be hired from the community, developed workflows for participant identification and referrals, and recruited local experts to co-deliver the staff training.",1d6dfecb-7056-4070-bbd6-216069d815af
3,methods3," Adaptations to the participant materials included the following: reducing and simplifying the educational text, highlighting low-cost options, adding photos of African American men, replacing some photos with local foods, and including an inventory of local resources (locations, hours, costs, and contact information). 17 Table 1.

5,methods5,"  Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) is a low-intensity (short duration with limited contacts) behavioral lifestyle intervention targeting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction through dietary and physical activity behavior changes, smoking cessation, and medication adherence. (See Table 1 for program content, planned duration of sessions/calls, and order of topics according to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction potential.) The dietary pattern promoted is a southern-style Mediterranean dietary pattern (Med-South) that includes affordable and familiar foods such as peanuts/peanut butter, vegetable oils, and adapted recipes for traditional southern foods such as hush puppies, collard greens, and barbeque. Med-south dietary goals include nuts and beans 3 times/week, at least 7 servings/day of fruits and vegetables, and less than 1 sugar-sweetened beverage/day.",04282767-ca52-4882-8979-957ef8e9c751
6,methods6," The physical activity recommendation is the same as that for US adults—at least 150 minutes/week.  The intervention involved 7 contacts: 4 monthly in-person counseling sessions delivered in participants’ homes or at local venues selected by the participant, and 3 brief booster calls between counseling visits. At the first counseling visit, participants received a manual with the full program content and a resource guide with information on local resources for healthy food, places to be physically active, wellness classes, and medication assistance. To maximize the potential benefits of lifestyle changes, sessions were introduced to participants based first on the participant’s selection of the behavior they most wanted to change, then on the potential cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction expected (highest to lowest) by making the behavior change. In a typical session, the Community Health Workers (CHW) covered up to 2 topics related to the participant’s top priority (e.g.",eba388b8-f9fd-4b89-9f34-60e7b44a15c4

Each session included goal setting, action planning, and referrals to community resources, as needed.  Site, Community Health Workers (CHW), and Participant Recruitment: Our study sites included an Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) and a local health department in Edgecombe County, NC. Edgecombe is a rural county located in the northeastern region of NC, with a population of about 51 000, poverty rate of 21%, and about 58% of the population self-identified as Non-Hispanic Black. 22 In 2021, Edgecombe County ranked in the least healthy quartile (0–25%) for health outcomes and health behaviors, among NC’s 100 counties. 23 Moreover, the county’s age-adjusted stroke, heart, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) death rates are all higher than the state rates.",aa2ac8cd-bcc4-480b-8365-0921b6f03a9c
8,methods8," 24  Inclusion criteria for enrollment included the following: living in or receiving medical care in the county, 18–80 years of age, and speaking English. Pregnant women were excluded or withdrawn, as pregnancy may account for observed changes in weight and blood pressure. The Community Health Workers (CHW) at the health department recruited participants through community outreach, with recruitment tilted toward primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In contrast, the Community Health Workers (CHW) at the Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) recruited through the electronic health record system, with a focus on secondary prevention. Patients were targeted for participation if they were smokers or had uncontrolled diabetes (A1c greater than 8%), hypercholesterolemia (low density lipoprotein [LDL] greater than 130 mg/dL), hypertension (systolic blood pressure >140 or diastolic >90 mmHg), or a previous cardiovascular event.",d60c832d-b3e9-4188-b316-1d4b58b000ee
9,methods9," Patients with multiple cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks were prioritized.  Staff Training for Intervention Delivery: The research team conducted an intensive 4-day study training (estimated 20 hours) with the staff responsible for participant recruitment and intervention delivery (site supervisors and Community Health Workers (CHW)s). Training sessions included the following content: study protocols, informed consent and participant confidentiality, participant recruitment, Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) intervention content, counseling principles (motivational interviewing and adult learning) and practice, community referral resources, and data collection methods.  Measures: Data collection included measures of both implementation and effectiveness outcomes; details have been published 20 and are briefly described here and below.",07c902c0-b275-4f0c-a1b7-707878a44065
10,methods10," Community Health Workers (CHW)s collected all participant data at counseling visits along with implementation process data related to participant recruitment and program delivery. To assess the utility of specific participant recruitment strategies, a single item asked participants how they heard about the program. Delivery fidelity measures included documentation of participant attendance, efforts used to contact participants missing program sessions/calls, session content and duration, goals set and progress made toward reaching goals, and referrals made with outcomes of referrals. Eligibility screening data used to rank health center patients by cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors were provided to the study staff through a data sharing agreement.  Implementation Outcomes: Data were collected to assess reach and delivery fidelity. Reach data included the number, representativeness (race/sex), and retention of participants.",62f46fef-083b-4ec8-85ff-efae6a2bd01c
11,methods11," Fidelity data included number of visits completed, goals set, referrals made to community resources, and disposition of referrals given (action taken and/or services received).  Effectiveness Outcomes: Program effectiveness measures included blood pressure, weight, and self-reported dietary and physical activity behaviors. Outcome measures were collected at the first and last intervention visits. Blood pressure (BP) measurements were taken with an automated BP machine (Omron HEM-907XL, Omron Healthcare, Lake Forest, IL). Three BP measurements (reported as an average systolic and diastolic value) were taken at 1-minute intervals after the participant was seated for 5 minutes. Weight (average of 2 measures) was assessed in pounds to the nearest 10th, using an electronic scale (Seca 874, Seca, Hanover, MD). Self-reported dietary behaviors were measured with items from 2 validated brief food frequency surveys measuring dietary fat quality 25 and estimated intake of fruits and vegetables.",43523220-4b08-4f0c-8606-b01a8756088f
12,methods12," 26 A single item adapted from the 2 items used in BRFSS 27 was used to assess usual daily consumption of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (“On an average day, how many 12-ounce servings of sugar-sweetened beverages do you drink with meals or in between meals? One regular can of beverage is 12 ounces.”). Self-reported data on physical activity behaviors was measured with the RESIDential Environment (RESIDential Environment (RESIDE)) survey 28 which was previously modified then validated in a sample of low-income women with overweight/obesity.  Statistical Analysis: Baseline sample characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics such as means, percentages, and standard deviations. Analyses of participant outcomes and pre–post changes at 4 months were conducted using paired t-tests.",12d4a5fc-4a1e-488d-ad51-ad4cdbaac6db
13,methods13," We also assessed for group differences between males and females, and age as an independent predictor of pre-/post-changes, after adjusting for baseline sex, diabetes, hypertension, and education. Since intervention effectiveness outcomes were secondary aims in this study, we did not use any imputation methods to account for missing values but provide a description of those lost to follow-up. All analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). ",a56ef1ad-aee8-4715-b33b-cf1e72826b99
14,results0," Community Health Workers (CHW)s successfully enrolled 255 participants and the majority of participants were representative of the population at greatest risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Edgecombe County where 58% of residents self-describe as Black or African American. 22 Given that about 35% of patients treated by NC Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)s 29 self-describe as Non-Hispanic Blacks, the Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) study was quite successful in reaching this group. Participant characteristics presented in Table 2 show most participants were Non-Hispanic Black (87%) and female (72%), with a mean age of 57 years, and over half (55%) reported having a high school diploma or less in educational attainment. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) included, 84% diagnosed with hypertension, 55% with diabetes, 65% had hypercholesterolemia, and about 20% were current smokers.",07fee392-48c3-43be-8bc4-bd3b47d4696a
15,results1," The mean baseline blood pressure values were 127 mmHg systolic, and 75 mmHg diastolic; the mean weight was 225 lbs. Self-reported physical activity was 113 minutes per week, and dietary behaviors included 3.3 daily servings of fruits and vegetables, 1.6 servings of nuts weekly, and 1.2 (12 oz) servings daily of sugar-sweetened beverages. In characterizing the study sample by site, we observed a few significant differences. Compared to the health department sample, there was lower educational attainment, more men, higher baseline weight, and a larger proportion with diagnosed diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia in the Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) sample.Table 2.

Participants lost to follow-up differed significantly from those included in study analysis by age and hypertension diagnosis; no race/ethnicity differences were observed. Those lost to follow-up were on average younger (52 y vs. 58 y, P < .01), and included more participants not diagnosed with hypertension (39% vs. 12%, P < .0001).Figure 1. Participant flow diagram  Study participants included 138 (54%) from the community health center and 117 (46%) from the local health department.

17,results4,"  The focus of the Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) study was effective implementation of an adapted evidence-based intervention. Figure 1, Table 2, and the text above describe our reach, representativeness, and retention. Table 3 includes other implementation variables describing recruitment strategies and intervention delivery fidelity. Nearly 60% of the 244 participants with data were recruited by a health care agency staff, site Community Health Workers (CHW), or patient lists generated from the Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) electronic health record. Among the community-based strategies, community events (e.g., health fairs and presentations) and word-of-mouth referrals accounted for the largest proportion of enrolled participants in this category.Table 3.

Implementation of the Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) program, as measured by delivery fidelity, showed participants received 3.5 counseling visits on average, with average duration of 70 minutes and 2.7 booster calls on average, with average duration of 10 minutes. The proportion of planned contacts completed by each site differed slightly, with the health department participants completing 89% of all planned visits, while the health center participants completed 94%.",f8033083-5310-4b66-9ac6-f9a6e43a5d67
20,results7,"  Participants could select the topic (module) considered their top priority and most participants (50%) chose “Healthy Eating” or did not select a priority topic (22%). Physical Activity was chosen by 14%, followed by Smoking Cessation (8%) and Medication Adherence (6%). The average counseling visit included discussion of about 2 topics and goals set, with about 1 referral made. Referrals were made to a variety of community resources, with food-related and physical activity resources accounting for the largest proportion of referrals (38% combined) among those specified. On average, participants given referrals attempted to follow-up on 34% of them and successfully accessed services for 30% of all referrals made.  Table 4 shows our program effectiveness outcomes (mean changes between pre- and post-intervention measurement) for completers. For physiological outcomes, we observed significant mean reductions in blood pressure but not weight.",14d93244-b822-42a7-95a5-284d3d579c63
21,results8," Moreover, there were significant increases in the proportion of participants who had a systolic pressure <130 mmHg and diastolic pressure <80 mmHg at follow-up. Self-reported dietary and physical activity behaviors also improved significantly. On average, weekly servings of nuts increased by half a serving, and fruits and vegetables by nearly one serving (.8). Participants also reported slightly lowering their daily intake of sugar-sweetened beverages. For physical activity, participants reported a mean weekly increase of 45 minutes. Analysis of differences in outcomes by sex showed no significant group differences, but some outcomes were related to age. After adjusting for baseline sex, diabetes, hypertension, and education, age was found to be a significant predictor of pre-/post-changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and fruit and vegetable intake, with greater age associated with larger pre-/post-changes.Table 4.

22,discussion0," Our findings demonstrate effectiveness in both implementation and effectiveness of the Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) intervention, and compared to our prior feasibility study, 18 several improvements in program implementation were observed. In the paragraphs that follow, we put our results in the larger context of lifestyle interventions and Community Health Workers (CHW)-delivered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction interventions (which are recommended by the Community Preventive Services Task Force), 13 focus on the improvements in implementation effectiveness outcomes, and conclude with implications for future research.  Community Health Workers (CHW)-delivered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction interventions are recommended by the Community Preventive Services Task Force, 13 but very few studies have included rural, diverse populations. The Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) study helps to fill that gap.",dc8af488-16d2-4f00-9ac7-9e2b898efa0d
23,discussion1," The evidence forming the basis of the Task Force recommendation came from 31 evaluations of interventions including Community Health Workers (CHW)s in different roles. Most (28 studies) were conducted in the US and in urban areas (22 studies), with only 4 studies in rural settings. Thirteen studies used a pre-/post-study design without a comparison group; 23 studies included adults 18–64 years with 5 studies including older adults; and 22 studies enrolled adults from underserved groups (defined as ≥75% African American, Hispanic, or low-income). Ten studies included study populations of more than 75% female while most were evenly distributed by gender. 13  In reviewing the studies included in the systematic review used by Community Prevention Task Force, 13 over one-third (39%) of all studies had follow-up rates of less than 80%. Our rate of 87% points to effective training and implementation procedures.",a289788e-c1c4-4140-b89b-905679dc3de5
24,discussion2," Additionally, we were able to recruit and retain a large sample of rural, Non-Hispanic Blacks, while Community Health Workers (CHW)s delivered the intervention with fidelity to protocols. We also observed program effectiveness outcomes that show promise and compare favorably with similar studies. Most of the Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) program content focused on dietary and physical activity behavior changes. From the studies summarized in the Community Prevention Task Force report, 13 we find that among the studies similar in design to Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) and delivered by Community Health Workers (CHW)s, all studies reported significant improvements in nutrition and physical activity outcomes. More broadly, there is demonstrated effectiveness of lifestyle interventions among persons with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.",d4f79a36-f6d0-492e-bfd4-777b7b6b7895
25,discussion3," 30  A closer look at our dietary outcomes as measured by self-reported fruit and vegetable intake shows that our mean increase of .8 serving per day (an increase of 24% from baseline), compares favorably with overall outcomes of increases between .1–1.4 servings per day (or a 9.7% to 59.3% increase from baseline) reported in reviews of lifestyle interventions designed to increase adult fruit and vegetable intake.30-33 If maintained, our reported increase in nuts intake is similar in magnitude to that observed in the PREDIMED trial’s nut arm where increased nut intake was associated with a 28% reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. 34 General improvements in healthy eating pattern by increased fruit and vegetable intake also contribute to systolic blood pressure reductions, 35 which in turn are associated with risk reductions for major cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.",217dc517-e388-48f2-87a7-3132ea8c0cb3
26,discussion4," 36 For our physical activity outcomes, comparing our mean increase of 45 minutes/week (or 40% of baseline) to other rural-based physical activity interventions, 12 we see that among the 8 studies included in this review, only 2 reported significant differences between study arms, and relative to controls the increase in physical activity was 15% 37 and 42% 38 of baseline values. The 40% increase from baseline in Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) is an encouraging outcome. The clinical relevance of these dietary and physical activity lifestyle changes is supported by meta-analysis of data showing significant risk reduction of 18% in fatal cardiovascular events among patients engaged in multifactorial lifestyle interventions. 39  When comparing our blood pressure outcomes to studies summarized in the Community Prevention Task Force report, 13 we find that among studies with a non-team-based care model and similar study designs (e.g.",0de0050a-b316-4311-a18e-cb1cfd799088
27,discussion5,", pre-/post-test without a comparison group), our outcomes are comparable or better. Defining blood pressure goal as < 130 for systolic and <80 for diastolic pressure, we observed with a 4-month intervention, a 6.7 (systolic) and 9.0 (diastolic) percentage point increase in the proportion of participants with blood pressure at goal. Similar studies in the Community Prevention Task Force report 13 found increases of 1.6 and 4.5 % points among studies that were 6 months or longer in duration. Our 4-month improvements in blood pressure control were much better by comparison. Changes in mean systolic and diastolic pressure in Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) were comparable to those reported by studies with a control or comparison group in the Community Prevention Task Force report. 13 Our decrease of 2.5 mmHg in systolic pressure was similar to the median 2.2 mmHg decrease reported (5 studies).",d39781cd-4baf-4e92-a08f-7e0f7e45efee
28,discussion6," Two studies similar to Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) found an increase of 2.3 and a decrease of 3.9 mmHg. For diastolic pressure, our 2.1 mmHg decrease is better than the median decrease of 1.3 mmHg reported by 5 studies with a control or comparison group, and an increase of .5 mmHg change in 1 study of similar design to Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE).  With the Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) study primarily focused on assessing the impact of implementation strategies, after the feasibility study we targeted refinements in 3 areas for this study: pre-implementation planning for staff turnover, Community Health Workers (CHW) and supervisor training improvements, and integrating Community Health Workers (CHW)s into the healthcare delivery team.",ad78f291-1d19-4357-a8c4-7806dcfdec51
29,discussion7," Our pre-implementation refinements included hiring 2 part-time Community Health Workers (CHW)s (20 hours/week) for the health department site rather than 1 full-time Community Health Workers (CHW) (40 hours/week), to allow for better coordination of task coverage when a Community Health Workers (CHW) took leave time or turned over. We also trained one of our University study staff to deliver the Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) program in the event of an emergency. Improvements in staff training involved the following: (1) refining the training content and approaches, (2) adding training specifically for the Community Health Workers (CHW) supervisor, and (3) providing on-going training in the form of monitoring and feedback related to implementation and program delivery. These improvements were accompanied by full retention of our Community Health Workers (CHW) staff.",28beb282-0e7e-4819-a4c0-4324ed10c128
30,discussion8,"  Other refinements included incorporating regular site meetings between the supervisor and Community Health Workers (CHW) into implementation protocols and regularly monitoring the data Community Health Workers (CHW)s entered into the data management system. By improving implementation planning and staff training, we anticipated improvements in both program delivery fidelity and participant retention, and both were observed. In the feasibility study, 80% of planned contacts (counseling visits and booster calls) were completed; in this phase we completed 91% of planned contacts. Our participant retention showed even greater improvements, increasing from 72% to 87% (with lost to follow-up dropping dramatically from 28% to 13%). The last area of refinement was better integration of the Community Health Workers (CHW) into the health care delivery team.",5b4b4749-930b-48a8-afbb-127d692c1705
31,discussion9," At the Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) site, the full-time Community Health Workers (CHW) was directly engaged with the primary health care providers and behavioral health staff. With Community Health Workers (CHW) supervision by a Care Coordination supervisor, there were more opportunities for the Community Health Workers (CHW) and the health care delivery team to work together in patient referrals and follow-up.  The strengths of this study are represented by these improvements in both implementation and program delivery outcomes stemming from our ability to successfully refine the strategies used in the feasibility study. This improved study helps to fill a gap in cardiovascular disease (CVD)-risk reduction intervention research involving Community Health Workers (CHW)s among rural, Non-Hispanic Black, and medically underserved populations.",01f84399-8077-43a9-a7c8-ad8fb4f3e2d1
32,discussion10," Moreover, in this study with a rural sample of mostly Non-Hispanic Black adults, we had very high rates of program uptake and study participant retention. One limitation of the initial feasibility study that remains in this study is that of our study design. With a single arm, pre–post study design we are limited in attributing the observed program effectiveness to the intervention itself. As previously mentioned, our focus was on implementation because the Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) intervention was adapted for Community Health Workers (CHW)-delivery from an evidence-based intervention. Another limitation is the short study duration relative to behavior change outcomes. Without a follow-up maintenance phase, there is no evidence of how long improvements in behaviors or blood pressure were maintained. To this point, the Task Force identified as an evidence gap, evidence from programs evaluated over periods longer than 12 months.",2794a310-31ba-47e4-85c2-2c36f706c419
33,discussion11," 13 Lastly, even though adults 18–80 years of age were eligible, we observed that those willing to volunteer were predominantly female and midlife in age. While we did not see any differences in program effectiveness by sex, the recruitment of men and younger adults to lifestyle intervention studies is area for improvement in future studies.  In summary, this study demonstrated that refinements to our initial implementation of the Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) program produced improvements in both implementation and program effectiveness and provide evidence supporting Community Health Workers (CHW)-delivered lifestyle interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among rural, Non-Hispanic Black, and medically underserved adults.",b15cb797-ad82-474b-90ab-f974ddc060af
34,discussion12," The potential for public health impact in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction and mortality is enhanced with the observed dietary changes consistent with the Southern-style Mediterranean dietary pattern promoted in the Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) program. Recent data from 2 large ongoing prospective cohort studies 40 support the benefits of increasing fruit and vegetable intake on mortality risk reduction and similar health benefits are observed with intakes consistent with a Mediterranean dietary pattern. 41 Moreover, our study findings have statewide implications for the role of Community Health Workers (CHW)s and health promotion programs like Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) in North Carolina’s transformation of their Medicaid Program and integration of Community Health Workers (CHW)s into the public health workforce while addressing social determinants of health.",426d5c2d-2b43-4e2f-a797-55b09f5bc313
35,discussion13," In July 2021, NC will begin the transformation of Medicaid from fee-for-service to managed care 42 and with it they will include opportunities to test and evaluate the impact of addressing non-medical drivers or social determinants of health, by providing evidence-based non-medical interventions targeting housing, food, transportation, and interpersonal safety to Medicaid enrollees with high needs. 43 A separate component of these healthy opportunities includes building infrastructure to develop and support the integration of Community Health Workers (CHW)s in the healthcare workforce. 44 Our study findings provide timely and state-specific data to inform these efforts. Beyond the NC context, there are also implications for future research targeting strategies to scale-up these low-intensity behavioral lifestyle interventions in public health agencies.",3c8bc60e-2384-441f-b2b5-53cf7aab965a
36,discussion14," Our results combining lowering of blood pressure with improved dietary habits in a hard-to-reach rural, underserved population suggest that sustaining community-clinical linkages that support chronic disease management and promote health using scalable lifestyle interventions like Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) could have a significant public health impact among those at highest risk.So What?  What is already known on this topic?  Cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) risk reduction interventions delivered by Community Health Workers (Community Health Workers (CHW)s) are recommended by the Community Preventive Services Task Force, but very few studies have included rural, racial, and ethnically diverse populations. Evidence gaps remain for implementation and effectiveness studies of Community Health Workers (CHW)-delivered interventions in rural settings and among underserved Non-Hispanic Black populations.",a2ea54f6-57d5-49c0-9ecd-bafb64f98980
37,discussion15,"  What does this article add?  Using a hybrid implementation-effectiveness study design, we evaluated the implementation and effectiveness outcomes of a Community Health Workers (CHW)-delivered, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction intervention in a sample of mostly Black adults living in a rural setting with high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.  What are the implications for health promotion practice or research?  Our results in a hard-to-reach rural, underserved population suggest that sustaining community-clinical linkages that support chronic disease management and promote health using low-intensity, scalable lifestyle interventions delivered by Community Health Workers (CHW)s could have a significant public health impact among those at highest risk.
