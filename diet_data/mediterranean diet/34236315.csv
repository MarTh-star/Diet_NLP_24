Participants  The study was conducted by the Laboratory of Epidemiology and Statistics of the National Institute of Gastroenterology, “S. de Bellis” Research Hospital, Castellana Grotte (BA), Italy, from March 2018 to February 2020. Enrolled subjects were invited to follow a 12-month diet and combined exercise program (CEP). Patients were recruited over two years, for a total of 54 participants, assigned to non-contemporary groups.  2.2. Study Design  A convenience sample was recruited for this observational study. General practitioners were invited to send patients suffering from metabolic dysfunctions. The inclusion criteria were: age between 18 and 65 years plus Metabolic dysfunctions [15,16,17].",1dd247b2-72a0-43a7-a976-39521ad51474
1,methods1," Exclusion criteria comprised: significant orthopedic or neuromuscular limitations; overt cardiovascular disease and revascularization procedures; stroke; clinical peripheral artery disease; any severe medical condition that could prevent the subject from following a nutritional program, and inability to follow a low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) for any reason.  2.3. Data Collection  Participants signed informed consent and the study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the local Ethical Committee. Participants completed a structured questionnaire about sociodemographic aspects, medical history, and lifestyle. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Food Frequency Questionnaire (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) FFQ) was used to probe eating behavior [18]. Blood samples were collected after overnight fasting, and biochemical measurements were performed using standardized methods.",c9d14ac9-2874-485c-8373-a5920cb98f75
2,methods2," Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference) were taken by trained dietitians. Weight measurements were taken with SECA mechanical scales (model 700; Hamburg, Germany), whereas height was measured with a wall altimeter (model 206; 220 cm; SECA, Hamburg, Germany). Subjects wore only underwear during measurement. The presence of hepatic steatosis was assessed and categorized (0 absent, 1 mild, 2 moderate, and 3 severe) using an Esaote MyLab70 XVG device and a Convex 5-Mhz probe, following standard criteria [2]. All measurements, including Liver Ultrasound (LU), were performed at baseline and every three months.  2.4. Dietary Program  The Low-Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD)) was provided in brochure format, with graphic explanations organized according to a traffic light system [19] with a list of foods that could be eaten frequently (green foods), sometimes (yellow foods), and never (red foods).",ee220305-a713-4084-a362-6c147df29f4d
3,methods3," There were no calorie restrictions. The brochure also contained a daily dietary record, where participants indicated the code of each food consumed at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and during snacks. The diet’s composition is shown in Appendix SA [20].  2.5. Exercise Program  The combined training protocol started with a 12-session conditioning period in which subjects perform low-intensity aerobic exercises (50–55% maximum Heart Rate (HRmax), accompanied by easy-to-perform strengthening exercises. To determine the maximum age-predicted heart rate, we used Tanaka’s formulas [21]. After this first period of conditioning, the training protocol was adapted specifically to considering the participants’ metabolic dysfunctions conditions. The EP structure is shown in Table 1.  Each exercise step lasted for 12 sessions; all participants wore a heart rate monitor. The EP was subdivided into three categories based on level of difficulty.",e2f02f3c-29ee-444c-920b-5e615d202916
4,methods4," The basic level included three sets of exercises consisting of 10 repetitions; the intermediate level, three to four sets of 15 repetitions; and the advanced level, which consisted of four to five sets of 20 repetitions. The aerobic exercise included treadmill walking, cycling, cross-training, and rowing. The strengthening exercises included free-body parts with the help of small tools and isotonic machines.  2.6. Adherence to low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD)  The Mediterranean Adequacy Index (Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI)) [22], was used to assess subjects’ compliance. We chose random weeks of the year, namely the 2nd, 7th, 10th, 16th, 23rd, 24th, 34th, 35th, 36th and 43rd. The participants were unaware of the days and weeks in which they would be evaluated. Compliance was defined as positive if the subject’s Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) was equal to or above the median expected value for the whole population under study; a median value of 7.",6c01ded0-7dfe-4713-985a-c2ff73cfbba9

Adherence to the Exercise Program  To assess adherence to the combined exercise program (CEP), the working year was split into 4 quarters. Adherence was assessed on the basis of frequency (at least 2 weekly attendances at training for a monthly total of 8, i.e., 24 attendances in three months), intensity (heart rate monitoring, based on the established work program; see Table 1) and workload (based on the established level of difficulty; see Table 1).  2.8.",dceb2698-ccea-4ce4-a825-ce89065a11f2
6,methods6," Statistical Analysis  We classified metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) participants into three subtypes based on the presence of different metabolic dysfunctions: hepatic steatosis in overweight/obese subjects (metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)1), hepatic steatosis and at least 2 metabolic abnormalities (metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)2), hepatic steatosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)3). A data description was performed by means (±SD), median (inter-quantile range), and frequencies (%) as appropriate. We defined as adherent those participants who remained above the expected Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) median for seven months and attended 60% of all sessions of combined exercise program (CEP). An appropriate variable (low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD)/combined exercise program (CEP)) was built.",8518c547-5f95-4b5b-a768-10bb0059de20
7,methods7," Joint modeling of longitudinal (body mass index (BMI) and homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR, which were repeatedly monitored over time) and time-to-event (disappearance of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) diagnostic criteria) data was performed to estimate the effect of adherence to low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD)/combined exercise program (CEP) on these processes. The two analyses were performed separately to clearly identify the predictive ability of body mass index (BMI) and homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR. Linear mixed models were performed for longitudinal trajectories of body mass index (BMI) and homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR over time. These variables were log-transformed to achieve normality. A random intercepts and linear longitudinal trajectory were set in the two models.",1bf5f09f-af7d-4bf1-9273-65bc1be4cdd2
8,methods8," In addition, an unstructured covariance matrix was applied. A Flexible Parametric Survival Model Cox with two degrees of was chosen [23]. The endpoint for the time-to-event model was the disappearance of the diagnostic criteria for metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) (mostly the absence of Hepatic Steatosis), withdrawal from the study or end of follow-up. All analyses were sequentially adjusted for Adherence to the low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD)/combined exercise program (CEP), Waist to Hip Ratio (Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR)), Sex, PCR, ALT, GPT, GGT and body mass index (BMI) or homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR. To choose the best set of covariates, biological and statistical criteria (Akaike’s and Schwarz’s Bayesian Information Criteria) were used.",8d9bed41-d21e-4518-bea4-7e48a9b0bbdc
9,methods9," A non-linear combination of coefficients was also used to test the overall effect of following the two programs on the log of body mass index (BMI)/homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR and on the time-to-event. Post-estimation tools were applied to obtain predictions. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Stata 17.0 statistical software (StataCorp, 4905 Lakeway Drive, College Station, TX, USA) was used.  3. Results  Characteristics of the sample are shown in Table 2.  Fifty-four subjects, 41 with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), were included in the study. Of these, 74% had metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)1 and 28% had metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)3; many subjects met the requirements for the different metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) subtypes. Most of the MALFD participants were men, especially in metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)3.",fd3b30f3-dc3d-4fcc-a905-fbd36247834e
10,methods10," The mean age was 53 ± 10 years. At baseline, mean weight was 87 ± 16 kg, body mass index (BMI) 32 ± 5 kg/m2 and Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR) index, 0.94. These values were higher in the metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)3 subtype (mean age 56 ± 8, mean weight 95 ± 16, mean body mass index (BMI) 34 ± 5 and mean Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR) 0.98).  Supplementary Table S1 shows the changes in metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) diagnostic criteria over time. These tended to decrease progressively until day 270, and then increase without reaching baseline values. These improvements were greater among adherent participants. In the whole sample, glucose metabolism percentages decreased progressively until the end of the project. In the first 7 months, 74% of participants exhibited a greater adherence to both low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) and combined exercise program (CEP) (about 70%).",db8bc537-6d10-41fa-94d6-2fa7dde839ed
11,methods11," From the seventh month to the end of follow-up, adherence tended to decrease. The temporal evolution of body mass index (BMI) as well as some liver and metabolic biomarkers are shown in Supplementary Table S2. A trend to improvement is seen for all markers until the 270th day overlapping adherence to the low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD)/combined exercise program (CEP). In particular, glycemic control was optimal until the 270th day of the program.  3.1. body mass index (BMI) Longitudinal Trajectory and Time-to-Event  The results of joint modelling of longitudinal and time-to-event data are shown in Table 3.  Overall, there was a non-statistically significant direct effect of low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD)/combined exercise program (CEP) on ln (body mass index (BMI)) (0.04, 95%CI −0.05; 0.13), a direct statistically significant effect of low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD)/combined exercise program (CEP) on time-to-event (−1.78, 95%CI −3.40; −0.",c9fd09c0-1dd5-4030-94da-64aec5d78993
12,methods12,"16), and a strong statistically significant direct effect of log (body mass index (BMI)) on time-to-event (−9.66, 95%CI −13.62; −5.69). The same behavior was observed in metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) subtypes.  3.2. homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR Longitudinal Trajectory and Time-to-Event  The results of joint modelling of longitudinal and time-to-event data are shown in Table 4.  Overall, there was a non-statistically significant direct effect of low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD)/combined exercise program (CEP) on ln(homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR) (−0.27, 95%CI −0.61; 0.07), a direct statistically significant effect of low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD)/combined exercise program (CEP) on time-to-event (−2.30. 95%CI −4.25; −0.",7424dd03-baa6-456c-ba48-92ad6244eec8
13,methods13,"34), and a statistically significant direct effect of ln(homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR) on time-to-event) (−3.38, 95%CI −6.69; −0.06). The same behavior was observed in metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) subtypes. The predicted hazard rates (speed to an event) over time are graphically displayed in Figure 1 (body mass index (BMI)) and Figure 2 (homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR).  As expected, the speed of time-to-event increases until the ninth month and then decreases.  Overall, there was a clear trend to metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)’s diagnostic criteria disappearance in the whole sample with an acceleration until the ninth month for both body mass index (BMI) and homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR in the whole sample as well as among adherent participants.",e9d6170d-7cb4-4beb-bb7a-2b9a7dcb29d1
14,methods14,"  Both figures showed a stronger and faster disappearance of the diagnostic criteria in the subgroup with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)3 than in metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)1, especially among adherent subjects.  The effect is more intense when homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR is considered. In fact, the difference between metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)1 and metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)3 is reduced in relation to body mass index (BMI).  It is clear that participants who had followed both diet and exercise plans achieved stronger and faster benefits than the others.  4. Discussion  This study has shown that, following an low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) and a combined exercise program (CEP), according to standard FITT principles, can induce changes that lead to the disappearance of some metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) diagnostic criteria.",c724ce0c-c40f-45ae-8562-6a9b7b1f996a
15,methods15," This event occurred both in the metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) group and metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) subtypes, but at a different speed. Moreover, the joint modeling of longitudinal (body mass index (BMI) and homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR) and time-to-event data proved to be a useful tool to monitor the underlying metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) clinical process.  For the management of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of lifestyle changes in the form of diet and physical activity, although the literature about lifestyle metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) treatment is scarce [9].  Recently, a practical guide for lifestyle modification using diet and exercise in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has been published.",7b0e3193-445e-412c-861b-a86f17e56994
16,methods16," Reducing body weight induces a decrease in liver fat and improves glucose control and insulin sensitivity [24]. Moreover, exercise can significantly reduce hepatic steatosis even in the absence of considerable weight loss [9].  To achieve weight loss, several recommendations have been formulated. The Mediterranean diet, or a low-fat diet with a low intake of red and processed meat and commercially produced fructose, has been promoted [25]. Our low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) satisfies these requirements and has shown to be effective in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) patients [19].  Furthermore, aerobic exercise has shown a positive effect on hepatic steatosis if performed as suggested in the literature; resistance training can be complementary to aerobic exercise but is not a substitute [8].",604f5e41-3fe3-447b-b9df-c59af7157805
17,methods17," In this sense, our studies of subjects with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) have shown that low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) and exercise, administered individually or in combination, produced positive effects [19,26,27].  In this study, the effects of changes in lifestyle were evident and stronger in adherent subjects to the program until at least 270 days from the beginning of follow up. These results are in line with a recent expert review [28]. In fact, in our metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) sample, metabolic dysfunctions showed an evident improvement, and then were followed by a tendency to return to initial values. However, none of the subjects dropped back to the baseline levels.  The difficulties in implementing and maintaining lifestyle changes for a long time are known, even if individuals are aware of the importance of a healthier lifestyle [29,30].",5eca8da2-114b-4b92-b8d5-8175316d7004
18,methods18,"  As shown in other studies, our data confirm that weight loss was associated with the disappearance of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) diagnostic criteria [10,31]. This association was statistically significant in metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) subtypes, especially in metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)1. Many studies have confirmed a positive association between the body mass index (BMI) change and the change in liver fat content [31,32]; in fact, for every 1% decrease in body weight, there was a 1% decrease in liver fat content. The higher the initial body mass index (BMI), the greater the reduction [33].  It has been shown that a low-saturated fat, low-GI diet, such as low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD), decreases hepatic fat in both sexes and reduces fat synthesis [19].",604364ba-f3c6-4a68-b5a8-f992f1c576c4
19,methods19,"  It is known that even small decreases in liver fat can be clinically relevant in subjects with high liver fat [34], especially if the diet can be maintained for a longer period.  Furthermore, the efficacy of the proposed combined exercise program (CEP) in the management of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is confirmed by numerous studies showing that exercise, especially aerobic exercise, is able to reduce visceral adiposity [9], thereby decreasing the influx of free fatty acids into the liver [35], and the systemic inflammation associated with metabolism. Moreover, it not only reduces the amount of adipose tissue, but also changes the structure and function of the adipocyte [9].  In addition, some studies showed that a combined exercise program (CEP) has an important effect on parameters such as waist circumference, body fat percentage, muscle mass, blood pressure, and resting blood pressure [36].",0f6a0c8d-2c98-460e-ae8f-bb14f47756e4
20,methods20,"  With regard to metabolic dysfunction improvement, aerobic exercise encompasses a series of benefits [37,38]. Specifically, aerobic exercise has an effect in reducing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and serum cholesterol levels, and resting blood pressure [38], whereas resistance exercise was negatively associated with dyslipidemia, hypertension and insulin resistance [37]. Moreover, resistance exercise is well tolerated by subjects with a low cardiorespiratory capacity or who are overweight and cannot tolerate aerobic exercise.  Although less than in other groups, weight loss also occurred in the metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)3 subtype. As suggested [39], a loss of 5–10% of body weight in diabetic subjects could improve overall fitness, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and reduce HbA1c levels and the use of antihyperglycemic drugs.",8874d769-c756-40a6-8c84-4d719065a641
21,methods21,"  In addition, subjects with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)3 appeared to have a greater and faster reduction in metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) diagnostic criteria than the others, probably due to the numerous benefits of diet and exercise on glucose metabolism.  Studies show that in diabetic patients, adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower HbA1c levels and numerous other benefits, such as an improvement in fasting glucose homeostasis, insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)) in both normoglycemic subjects and diabetic participants. Subjects with a high Mediterranean diet adherence score had a 15% reduction in glucose and insulin at baseline and a 27% increase in the homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA) index [40,41].",2169974a-64df-4ce4-be79-44d7772681b4
22,methods22,"  On the other hand, exercise and thus muscle contraction allow for an increase in glucose uptake by muscle through the displacement of GLUT-4 glucose receptors in the cell membrane independent of the action of insulin [42]. Also, exercise increases the muscle glucose storage as glycogen [43], it redirects circulating free fatty acids from the liver to the muscle [44], and it increases their uptake and oxidation by the muscle [45]. In addition, in the post-exercise period, glucose oxidation decreases at the expense of fat oxidation in order to replenish the glycogen store [46].  The observed effect of homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR was associated with the disappearance of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) diagnostic criteria in all metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) subtypes.",d1146901-63bc-4dc7-869b-c24785a641bf
23,methods23," An insulin resistance reduction has been associated to a reduced progression of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and hepatic fibrosis [47]. As is well known, diabetes and hepatic steatosis share several molecular biology mechanisms, the most important one being insulin resistance [48]. homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR has been reported to decrease significantly with increasing exercise levels [49], and moderate-intense aerobic EP produced positive effects on glucose tolerance, independently of changes in abdominal fat. Even in adult subjects with abdominal obesity, the relationship between homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR and exercise is very strong, although this association may be influenced by waist circumference. It is interesting to note that insulin resistance appears long before diabetes [50] and seems to accelerate hepatic fibrosis.",ef964e61-9b8f-428a-8b75-6f24a65ce5a9
24,methods24," Therefore, homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR monitoring can play an essential role in preventing the late stages of hepatic steatosis [51].  The application of these new statistical methodologies to measurements that are routinely collected in clinical practice may identify useful tools for monitoring clinical processes that would otherwise require complex and costly laboratory research, saving time and avoiding the overburdening of the healthcare system. Moreover, the lifestyle treatment could reduce the recourse to pharmacological therapy, reducing costs further.  This study has strengths and limitations. The low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) and the combined exercise program (CEP) were administered under the supervision of specialized personnel. The combined exercise program (CEP) was built following specific FITT parameters and then adapted to each subjects’ metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)-associated conditions.",83cbe149-86b4-4995-8a8d-e26aceec6197
25,methods25," Both low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) and combined exercise program (CEP) adherence was measured and an overall measure was estimated. Because we enrolled a convenience sample, it is possible that we could have recruited the most health-conscious people, so selection bias may be present. However, all diagnostic and follow-up assessments were performed in the same way, avoiding misclassification bias.  Statistical and biologic criteria were applied to obtain valid estimates while adjusting for all measured variables. However, residual confounding may still be present. Finally, in an observational study setting it is not possible to generalize the conclusions. Thus, randomized clinical trials are needed to disentangle the association among mechanisms underlying subtypes of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), diet and combined exercise program (CEP).",f9e3bf78-b1fa-4f03-bbfe-478c03b705e0
26,methods26," Studies of combined exercise program (CEP) and metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) should follow FITT recommendations to enhance the comparability of results with the aim of defining disease-specific protocols.  5. Conclusions  low glycemic index Mediterranean diet (LGIMD) and a combined exercise program (CEP) for 12 months with a progressively increased EP intensity up to 70–75% of HRmax, achieving a weekly volume of at least 180 min, lead to a significant improvement of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Moreover, body mass index (BMI) and homeostasis insulin levels and a better insulin resistance index (HOMA)-IR, longitudinally measured, showed a good predictive ability for estimating the probability of time-to-event of interest (disappearance of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) diagnostic criteria) in this sample.",3554d110-f909-4a25-9916-7a9f28f3cfba
27,methods27," This type of methodology may help in the clinical-decision making process in order to reduce the resulting public health costs.  Therefore, together with specific drug therapy, a multidisciplinary team is needed to improve the management and treatment of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and to increase the motivation of patients to follow the correct lifestyle.
