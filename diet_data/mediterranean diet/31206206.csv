0,introduction0,"Cardiovascular disease (Cardiovascular disease (CVD)) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in high- and middle-income countries [1, 2] and imposes a major economic burden on both the healthcare system and society. Endothelial dysfunction, a primary mechanism involved in the development of arteriosclerotic disease, is widely recognized as a significant predictor of cardiovascular risk [3, 4]. Over the last 2 decades, endothelial function has been evaluated by noninvasive methods, such as one that determines the endothelium-dependent dilation capacity of the brachial artery, flow-mediated dilation (flow mediated dilation (FMD)) [5]. Although the strong correlation between flow mediated dilation (FMD) and cardiovascular risk factors is well-established [6, 7], different studies have suggested that flow mediated dilation (FMD) may be more useful in screening for recurrent cardiovascular events in high-risk patients [8–10] than in a healthier general population [11].",e692c5fe-6959-4365-884a-82f653ae5ccd
1,introduction1," Low flow mediated dilation (FMD) values have been related to a higher cardiovascular event rate and all-cause mortality than normal or high flow mediated dilation (FMD) values in the context of coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) [12, 13].  In this context, increased levels of endothelial microparticles (EMPs; vesicles formed from endothelial cells membrane after injury) have been associated with endothelial injury and dysfunction [14]. Conversely, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are related to the maintenance of endothelial integrity and function [15]. The functional properties of EPCs, including cell adherence, migration, invasion, and vessel formation, appear to be attenuated in patients with established Cardiovascular disease (CVD) [16]. The EMPs/EPCs ratio is therefore becoming a marker of imbalance between endothelial injury and repair and may be related to the incidence of new cardiovascular events [17, 18].",b00c3e2d-6fc4-4cb4-a746-ff3ae8a77fd8
2,introduction2,"  Maintaining the correct endothelial function requires a balance between the mechanisms that protect its integrity and those that repair/recover from its dysfunction, known as vascular endothelial homeostasis [17]. This term refers to the balance in the production of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), a decrease in the proapoptotic environment, and the ability to regenerate the endothelium through angiogenesis. These biological processes are regulated by an epigenetic component such as micro-RNAs (miRNAs) and exerted by specific proteins.  Strong evidence supports the idea that lifestyle factors, such as diet, influence endothelial function.",44999346-f7bd-4bdd-acaf-fa62132e10ec
3,introduction3," While saturated fatty acid (saturated fatty acid (SFA))-rich diets have been proven to impair endothelial function [19], the consumption of diets rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), such as the Mediterranean diet pattern, has been linked to improved endothelial function in metabolic syndrome [20, 21] as well as overweight/obesity or hypercholesterolemic patients [22–27]. A beneficial effect of substituting saturated fatty acid (SFA)s with MUFAs or n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on circulating EPC and microparticle numbers has recently been described in individuals with moderate cardiovascular risk [19]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated the long-term dietary effect on endothelial function and mechanisms related to vascular endothelial homeostasis in a large-scale population of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients.",20f052ae-7260-4611-8390-73d5c10fdbfd
4,introduction4," The importance of these studies lies in the fact that the cardiovascular event recurrence rate in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with endothelial dysfunction (low flow mediated dilation (FMD) levels) is higher compared with those with normal endothelial function [8]. It is therefore a high priority to find therapeutic approaches that could improve the endothelial dysfunction in this group of patients.  On the basis of the evidence discussed above, the primary objective of the CORonary Diet Intervention with Olive oil and cardiovascular PREVention (cardiovascular PREVention (CORDIOPREV)) study is to evaluate the efficacy of a Mediterranean diet, rich in MUFAs from olive oil, as compared with a low-fat diet to prevent clinical events and mortality in patients with previous coronary heart disease (CHD) in a long-term follow-up study.",42648183-2f92-4bce-abc1-48b1f1eebe06
5,introduction5," The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate the long-term effect of 2 healthy dietary models (Mediterranean diet and a low-fat diet) on restoring endothelial dysfunction in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). A secondary analysis was to explore the biological process related to vascular endothelial homeostasis to identify a dietary model that recovers endothelial functionality and decreases the risk of recurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).  Material and methods Study design The current work was conducted within the framework of the cardiovascular PREVention (CORDIOPREV) study (clinicaltrials.gov number NCT00924937).

The present study aims to evaluate a secondary endpoint of the cardiovascular PREVention (CORDIOPREV) study, the effect of the 2 dietary patterns on endothelial function (measured by flow mediated dilation (FMD)) [28].  Patients were recruited from November 2009 to February 2012, mostly at Reina Sofia University Hospital, Córdoba, Spain, but also from other hospitals in the neighboring provinces of Córdoba and Jaen.",da5e5152-96a8-46cc-9bc2-dcdbcc44488d
7,introduction7," To summarize, patients were eligible if they were aged 20–75, with established coronary heart disease (CHD) but without clinical events in the last 6 months, with the intention of following a long-term monitoring study, with no other serious illnesses and a life expectancy of at least 5 years. All patients gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. The study protocol was approved by the Human Investigation Review Committee at Reina Sofia University Hospital (consent orally obtained), according to institutional and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.  Randomization and dietary intervention Randomization was performed by the Andalusian School of Public Health, as previously described [28]. The study dietitians were the only members of the intervention team to know about the dietary group of each participant. Briefly, the randomization was based on the following variables: sex (male, female), age (<60 and ≥ 60 years old), and previous myocardial infarction (yes, no).",3653dd06-4298-44a6-984e-f25f45235a1b
8,introduction8," Each patient was randomly stratified, in addition to the conventional treatment for coronary heart disease (CHD), to one of two potentially healthy diets: 1) the Mediterranean diet, with a minimum 35% of calories from fat (22% MUFAs, 6% PUFAs, and <10% saturated fatty acid (SFA)s), 15% proteins, and a maximum of 50% carbohydrates; and (2) a low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet, as recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program (National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)) and the American Heart Association (American Heart Association (AHA)), with <30% total fat (12%–14% MUFAs, 6%–8% PUFAs and <10% saturated fatty acid (SFA)s), 15% protein, and a minimum 55% carbohydrates.

In the low-fat diet group, participants received personalized recommendations according to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) dietary guidelines in use at the beginning of the study. The main recommendations were focused on limiting all types of fat consumption (both animal and vegetable) and on increasing the intake of complex carbohydrates.",8b917d04-5430-4bf0-81c7-cf3a27c03bce
11,introduction11," Specifically, they were advised to minimize the amount of oil used for cooking and dressing (≤2 tablespoons/day); not to eat more than 1 serving of red meat per week; choosing low-fat dairy products; consumption of lean fish instead of oily fish or fish/seafood canned in oil (≤1 serving/week); avoidance of nuts and seeds (≤1 serving/ week); to limit the consumption of commercial bakery goods, sweets, and pastries (≤ 1 serving/week); and to cook without the use of oil.  S4 Table provides the intake of main food groups at baseline and after 1 year of intervention. The consumption of whole grains (unrefined) instead of refined grains was recommended in both dietary intervention groups. Patients increased the intake of whole grains and reduced those refined grains after both the Mediterranean diet and the low-fat diet.",a38a245f-7889-4311-a938-044cccb4084e
12,introduction12," Although the low-fat diet provided a greater intake of whole grains than the Mediterranean diet, the intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts (good sources of fiber) increased in both diet groups, being more marked after the Mediterranean diet. In our study, although both dietary models share common characteristics in some of the major components (i.e., high intake of vegetables, fruit, legumes, and whole grains), patients consuming the Mediterranean diet also had a high intake of oily fish, nuts, and extra virgin olive oil, together with a low intake of harmful foods such as red/processed meats and pastries/commercial bakery products [29].

A total of 805 patients completed the ultrasonography study (n = 418, Mediterranean diet and n = 387, low-fat diet). The baseline characteristics of this subgroup of patients did not differ from the total cardiovascular PREVention (CORDIOPREV) cohort (n = 1,002) (S5 Table). 197 patients were excluded, mainly because they did not complete the ultrasonography study (at baseline or after 1 year of each diet: n = 161, 16%) or because of problems related to the technique (n = 36, 3.4%) (Fig 1).  10.1371/journal.pmed.1003282.",f743c737-1d2c-4e4a-be51-4b8dd8328a7f

In order to classify the patients according to the severity of the endothelial dysfunction, we used the flow mediated dilation (FMD) cutoff value of the first tertile (low values of flow mediated dilation (FMD)) to discriminate between those with severe endothelial dysfunction from the remaining patients with nonsevere endothelial dysfunction (tertiles 2 and 3).",b8e149b5-1bc3-4911-988a-e1a7da41548d

Additionally, in patients with nonsevere endothelial dysfunction, we observed lower levels of 3 miRNAs and higher levels of 9 miRNAs after the follow-up period with a Mediterranean diet compared with the low-fat diet (Table 4 and Fig 7D).  We performed a bibliographic search and a mechanistic study into the role of miRNAs and their effect at proteomic level (S5 Fig). Patients who consumed the Mediterranean diet had lower miR181c-5p levels as compared with low-fat diet, inhibiting the proapoptotic action of this miRNA.",e9b6e0cd-6a3e-4c37-a386-c5cc82acc898
45,results27," It has been reported that miR181c-5p is also implicated in reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis, so the reduction of the levels of this miRNA would lead a decrease of GPx3, an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as we observed in our proteomic study [34]. We also found low levels of miRNA let-7e-5p after consumption of the Mediterranean diet compared with the low-fat diet. This miRNA has been reported to participate in the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) and the consequent activation of the inflammatory pathway [35]. In this context, our proteomic analysis revealed a decrease in C reactive protein (CRP) (target gene of NF-kB) after the consumption of Mediterranean diet.",2c941e57-87b6-4b1e-8774-49788b283e34
46,results28," Our results also suggest that the Mediterranean diet induced low levels of miR-939-5p, which regulate the expression of genes involved in proliferation and cellular migration (Stromal interaction molecule 1 [STIM1] and catenin) [36, 37], possibly increasing cell proliferation. Moreover, it has been reported that miR-188 inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) gene expression, which is a strong regulator of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which acts on cellular senescence and the development of atherosclerosis [38]. The increased levels of this miRNA, observed after the consumption of the Mediterranean diet, could explain the reduction of endothelial cell senescence.",84e89641-b46d-4539-b265-35b7b96883d4

48,discussion0,"Our results suggest that the consumption of 2 healthy dietary patterns exerted different effects on endothelial function and markers related to vascular endothelial homeostasis in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. In this sense, we observed a modulation of endothelial function after consumption of the Mediterranean diet, increasing flow mediated dilation (FMD) and EPC content and decreasing EMP levels and EMP/EPC ratio, regardless of the severity of endothelial dysfunction. Our data also suggest the Mediterranean diet decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cellular apoptosis, and endothelial cell senescence while increasing cellular proliferation and angiogenesis. Additionally, we observed a regulation of the levels of the miRNAs that are involved in the inhibition of genes and proteins related to biological processes directly associated with endothelial dysfunction and endothelial vascular homeostasis after consumption of this diet.",b3ccbf19-618c-4163-acad-ae48f400206e
49,discussion1," However, the low-fat diet seems to have no effect on endothelial function in any group of patients, but we observed an increased endothelial damage regardless of the severity of endothelial dysfunction. Nevertheless, our data suggest that this diet slightly increased EPC content in patients with nonsevere endothelial dysfunction, although it failed in the capacity to increase EPCs in patients with severe endothelial dysfunction.  The notion that the Mediterranean diet produces an improvement in endothelial function has been widely described in different populations such as healthy elderly patients [20], metabolic syndrome patients [40], hypercholesterolemic patients [22, 41], or patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [30].",4666b085-b9c2-4441-a11f-9ebd0fa49a5e
50,discussion2," The potential effect of the Mediterranean diet in improving endothelial dysfunction, as well as different cardiovascular risk factors (blood lipids, glucose, or inflammation), and reducing cardiovascular events (in primary and secondary prevention) [42, 43] could be attributed to its fatty acid profile, as well as to its high antioxidant content (mainly phenolic compounds such as hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, phenyl alcohols, and flavonoids). In fact, our results suggest that the Mediterranean diet produced higher high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) cholesterol levels and lower fasting glucose and high sensitive C reactive protein (CRP) (hsC reactive protein (CRP)) levels than the low-fat diet, in accordance with other dietary intervention studies [40, 44–46].",9321eeed-d1de-4f6c-b41c-00bea3e291db
51,discussion3," Moreover, in comparison to the low-fat diet, the Mediterranean diet provided a lower content of total carbohydrates, which suggests that this model of diet could also reduce the deleterious effect of carbohydrate-induced hyperglycemia on endothelial function [47]. This beneficial effect of the Mediterranean diet is also corroborated by the observed reduction of circulating MG levels, as we have described previously [48, 49]. MG—a major precursor of AGEs, which are generated endogenously by nonenzymatic glycation of proteins—can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cause oxidative stress by reacting within the vessel wall and modifying the structure and function of the endothelial vasculature [50].",8635e1a7-2f13-4346-b219-bad586a148d3
52,discussion4,"  We have previously shown that the short-term consumption (4 weeks) of a Mediterranean diet produced a higher number of EPCs and a lower EMP concentration, together with a greater ischemic reactive hyperemia, compared with both an saturated fatty acid (SFA)-rich diet and a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet in an elderly population [51]. This potential relationship has also been described recently by Weech and colleagues [19], who showed a beneficial effect on endothelial repair and maintenance, increasing the number of EPCs and reducing EMP levels, by the replacement of dietary saturated fatty acid (SFA)s with MUFAs or n-6 PUFAs for 16 weeks in 190 patients at high risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, no association was found between EPC numbers and flow mediated dilation (FMD), possibly because of the absence of phenolic compounds, since this study used refined olive oil as the primary source of MUFAs [19].",2347af14-0be2-436c-9bb6-e98b7af3f54f
53,discussion5," Taking these short-term study results into account, there remains a need to explore the effect of dietary models on endothelial vascular homeostasis for longer periods. We observed higher EPC content after the long-term consumption of the Mediterranean diet, even in those patients with severe endothelial dysfunction, suggesting that this dietary model provides additional benefits to endogenous repair mechanisms by counteracting EMP release and by replacing dysfunctional/damaged endothelium. Conversely, the low-fat diet seems to increase circulating EPC levels but only in those patients with nonsevere endothelial dysfunction (at lower risk of cardiovascular recurrence), exerting an imbalance of endothelial vascular homeostasis in patients with severe endothelial dysfunction.",8aef6d31-453a-4684-aa58-e88ba521aaf6
54,discussion6," These results suggest that the Mediterranean diet, but not a low-fat diet, could be recommended as the best dietary strategy to recover severe endothelial dysfunction and therefore reduce the increased risk of presenting a cardiovascular recurrence in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with severe endothelial dysfunction.  In order to determine whether the diet could modulate cell mechanisms involved in endothelial vascular homeostasis associated with endothelial function impairment, we performed in vitro experiments on different endothelial cell models. We observed an increase in endothelial repair mechanisms (cellular proliferation and angiogenesis) and a decrease in mechanisms associated with endothelial damage (in vitro reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cellular senescence and apoptosis) after the Mediterranean diet, regardless of the severity of endothelial dysfunction [52, 53].",afb6a1f1-481a-4913-a274-47ca919841f6
55,discussion7," In this way, the Mediterranean diet seem to induce changes in the levels of miRNAs that modulate the expression of specific target genes to regulate biological processes involved in endothelial dysfunction and vascular endothelial homeostasis, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis, attenuation of cell senescence, promoting cellular migration and proliferation, and inhibition of the proinflammatory pathway. All these biological processes were reflected by increased levels of EPCs, low endothelial cell senescence, and a reduction of oxidative stress/inflammation.  Our study has a number of major strengths. It is well known that coronary heart disease (CHD) patients who also have endothelial dysfunction are at high risk of recurrence of a cardiovascular event [12].",b6652c09-edc1-45ec-8bc0-7f4e0b5836ec
56,discussion8," Therefore, our results provide a dietary strategy as a clinical and therapeutic tool that could reduce the high cardiovascular recurrence of these patients by improving endothelial dysfunction and achieving a better balance of endothelial vascular endothelial homeostasis by consuming a Mediterranean diet, but not a low-fat diet. Moreover, the study presents a randomized design that involves 2 dietary models involving a large number of patients (n = 805).  Nevertheless, the study also has its limitations. The evaluation of endothelial function is a secondary endpoint of the cardiovascular PREVention (CORDIOPREV) study. As in any substudy, the results of this study should be treated with caution. Secondly, because of the exploratory nature of the analyses, the possibility of false-positive findings could arise through multiple tests.",10de2997-66a4-4fed-9007-09563148b29f
57,discussion9," Moreover, the results from a Mediterranean population may not be generalizable to other populations and require replication in other cohorts of coronary patients, such as those who have suffered a stroke. Genetic and environmental factors could also influence the prognostic value of flow mediated dilation (FMD) [54]. Finally, dietary compliance during such an extended period could be a factor, although in this case, adherence to the recommended dietary pattern was excellent, as shown by the rigorous dietary assessment measurements [28].  In summary, our data suggest that the consumption of a Mediterranean diet may improve endothelial dysfunction in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients by achieving a better balance of vascular endothelial homeostasis, even in those at high risk of cardiovascular events (with severe endothelial dysfunction).",136b0a4e-3fbb-424e-8d93-f5440d741512
