Discussion Several studies have reported that a Mediterranean dietary regimen has a favorable role in the prevention of sarcopenia [22,23]. Moreover, in our previous study, we demonstrated that Extra virgin olive oil (EVO) possesses anti-oxidative properties and can improve the adaptive response of the body in conditions of oxidative stress [24,25], thanks to its ability to scavenge free radicals, thus preventing cellular injury.",c2b2b7f0-84c4-40c5-b2bb-856ca948e3e6
21,methods22," Phenolic compounds in Extra virgin olive oil (EVO) have been also shown to exert beneficial effects on oxidative stress with subsequent positive effect on disease risk. Our results confirmed the original hypothesis, since the muscle fibers of rats fed with Extra virgin olive oil (EVO)-based high-fat diet (HExtra virgin olive oil (EVO)-DS) were hypertrophic, comparable to those of the regular diet (R-DS) group, confirming that Extra virgin olive oil (EVO) does not have the same detrimental effect on muscle fiber as other kinds of fat, in particular butter, as shown in high fat butter based diet (HFB) groups. In fact, we found an inverse correlation between the dietary fat content and the perimeter of muscle fibers (p < 0.01).",9db253b8-b4f9-4c90-ac98-0fe30d3d4bcb
22,methods23," In high fat butter based diet (HFB)-DR, the muscle fibers appeared hypotrophic, probably because VitD action was lacking and the high fat butter based diet (HFB) diet led to the increase of IL-1β expression and to a dramatic decrease of insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 expression. When the supplementation of VitD antagonized the fat effect, as in high fat butter based diet (HFB)-DS, the fibers were not different from the control. VitD depletion, per se, did not show any effects when associated with the three dietary profiles, and this was probably due to the relatively short term of the restriction in young rats. Conversely, Extra virgin olive oil (EVO) did not show detrimental effects on muscle fiber size in the HFExtra virgin olive oil (EVO)-DR group, although IL-1β was more expressed in comparison to control. Our results are in line with the recent literature. Obesity is a known state of chronic inflammation associated with a reduction in skeletal muscle regeneration [5].",db79ccd7-956c-4aff-b6e1-064280488f02
23,methods24," Indeed, obese mice displayed abnormal muscle fiber size, providing evidence for a cross-talk between human obese adipocytes and muscle cells, leading to muscle atrophy [26]. Such studies on obese mice [26] found the same results that we highlighted in our high-fat diet model, in which rats are not obese. Lipids accumulate ectopically in non-adipose tissues like skeletal muscles, impairing the repair process following injury. Considerable interest was raised in exploring the putative pleiotropic functions of VitD. VitD exerts its biological effects [27] via binding to VitD receptor (VitD receptor (VDR)) and stimulates muscle recovery [28]. Moreover, acute inflammation triggers the process of muscle regeneration [29], with a critical role of the immune cells. Several observational studies have been performed on the role of VitD in skeletal muscle proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis as well as in immune cells regulation [30].",c42b7f9e-cf2b-4ceb-afa9-4ed938f85760
24,methods25," VitD receptor (VDR) knock-out mice have provided evidence for a role of VitD receptor (VDR) in the development and differentiation of skeletal muscle, showing smaller myofibers in knock-out mice than in wild-type mice [31]. Animal models suggested that the administration of VitD leads to an increase in proliferation and a decrease in apoptosis in injured muscle [32], and, conversely, a high-fat diet with VitD deficiency would markedly impair bone and muscle metabolism [33]. A clinical trial highlighted that VitD supplementation in sedentary women increased VitD receptor (VDR) expression and muscle fiber size [34]. These results indicate a direct effect of VitD on myocites, leading to the enhancement of skeletal muscle recovery [35]. VitD has effects not only on muscle cells [28], but also on immune cell functions [36], so we decided to investigate the relationship between VitD and inflammation.",5342514e-9a13-4a9e-a42a-a78e159751a9
25,methods26," Several recent studies have identified inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1, IL-6, and Tumor Necrosis Factor (Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF))-α, as contributing to the development of sarcopenia [37], since they may induce muscle atrophy promoting protein degradation and reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) accumulation [38,39]. Adipocytes secrete inflammatory cytokines as well as adipokines, leptin, and adiponectin, which promote inflammation and fat mass accumulation, impairing muscle mass formation [38]. IL-1β is a major cytokine produced largely by adipose tissue macrophages. Its release is enhanced in obesity [40] and it is implicated in the development of insulin resistance [40]. The blood concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-13 were found decreased in VitD-deficient subjects following physical training, compared to controls.",b5f07f3e-1746-4132-94fe-e3475599b290
26,methods27," Conversely, in a rat model, VitD supplementation modulated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in muscle following intensive physical exercise [41]. Moreover, a recent research by our group demonstrated similar effects of the administration of Extra virgin olive oil (EVO) with diet on muscles undergoing exhaustive exercise in rats [25], supporting the view that Extra virgin olive oil (EVO) can improve the adaptive response of the body in conditions of oxidative stress [25]. In the present study, indeed, IL-1β was more expressed in high fat butter based diet (HFB) groups, but in regular diet and HFExtra virgin olive oil (EVO) groups it was clear that the VitD restriction led to a higher expression of IL-1β, confirming the hypothesis that VitD could be beneficial against inflammation.",0b31c6de-744f-4ece-b722-f1c2e3217907
27,methods28," Furthermore, in comparison to butter, Extra virgin olive oil (EVO) is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) such as oleic acid, that exert antinflammatory activity [41,42]. Conversely, the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) in HFExtra virgin olive oil (EVO) is lower than in regular diet, and this can further explain the lower expression of IL-1β in the latter.   Insulin resistance has been associated to cases of both excess fat and sarcopenia, given that skeletal muscle is one of the major target tissues of insulin action [43]. Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1) act on body composition, protein metabolism in the skeletal muscle, as well as bone growth and remodeling [44] and lipid and glucose homeostasis. At the molecular level, IL-6 and IL-1β downregulate insulin like growth factor (IGF) signaling, decreasing muscle protein synthesis [45].",bee6daae-1da1-4e6a-b36b-2e67035e90b9
28,methods29," Fatty liver has been related to the reduction of insulin sensitivity at the level of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue [46]. In fact, the main source of circulating insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 is exactly the liver, which is considered a target tissue for VitD [47]. Authors showed that VitD supplementation increased circulating insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 [48], and we confirmed this observation, but what was clearer is the reduction of insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 in both high-fat diets. Similarly, muscle size and strength, as well as insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels decreased in mice with diet-induced non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and, as in our study, the morphological aspects of sarcopenia were observed in early stages, prior to the development of liver fibrosis [49].",1342c6bb-19d9-4259-9f59-e6f13f53ecff
29,methods30," Another pathway we tried to explore in order to explain how VitD could influence muscle is the Wnt (Wingless-type MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus) integration site family)/β-catenin pathway. In fact, the targets for VitD include low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)5, the Wnt coreceptor, that plays a key role in osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and function [50]. A new field of research linking VitD with cell proliferation and Wnt pathway is oncology. In breast and colon cancer, VitD increased dose dependently the expression of the extracellular canonical Wnt inhibitor, Dickkopf (DKK)-1, that is associated with growth inhibition, showing a protective role of VitD against breast cancer development, progression, and metastasis [51]. From this consideration, we hypothesized that VitD could exert its action in muscle through the expression of Dickkopf (DKK)-1. The latter, indeed, is involved in many processes of bone metabolism, but exerts also action on muscle.",4bb9226f-a928-48ba-be6e-21befc927f5a
30,methods31," This is well known in cardiomyocytes, where Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in the regulation of cardiac remodeling and injury responses [52]. Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes fibrosis in response to injury in order to prevent cardiac dilation [52] and, interestingly, it has also been reported in fibrotic diseases of other organs (liver, lung, and kidney), since it is crucial for the differentiation of fibroblasts and for collagen production [52]. Increased Wnt signaling may inhibit myogenicity, impairing the muscle regenerative potential by promoting the transition of aged skeletal muscle to fibrogenic tissue, thereby accelerating aging [38]. This lineage conversion can be suppressed by Wnt inhibitors [53], like Dickkopf (DKK)-1 that is upregulated by VitD [54].",9f9bbe6b-dcb7-4c55-ac55-5468b0bcf440
31,methods32," In our study, Dickkopf (DKK)-1 expression correlated directly with muscle fiber perimeter and VitD receptor (VDR) expression and, most importantly, with dietary VitD supplementation, without differences attributable to different fats. Thus, by comparing the different dietary profiles, we can conclude that VitD supplementation causes muscle fiber hypertrophy both in regular and HFExtra virgin olive oil (EVO) diet, probably through a pathway involving insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 and Dickkopf (DKK)-1.   Our results need to be strengthened by further studies, since the small sample size was a major limitation.  5. Conclusions Our morphological results are consistent with the original hypothesis of the study and show the effect of nutrition on skeletal muscle as an emerging topic of interest. High-fat western diet could impair muscle metabolism and create a basis for subsequent muscle damage.",bc93c603-e9b7-4521-83d7-35fc03aa37cd
32,methods33," Vitamin D shows trophic action on muscle fibers, not only in rats fed with regular diet, but also in the case of a diet mimicking the Mediterranean diet. Our research supports the hypotheses that the relationship between muscle and adipose tissue starts earlier than obesity and that we can modify muscle metabolism with a dietary intervention. However, this is a preliminary research, and further study is needed to strengthen and confirm our data. ",1a349e25-d3e7-4bf6-9439-fd9fd685646c
