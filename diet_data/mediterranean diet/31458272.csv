Plant Sources Vitamin B12 Detection in Plants Cultivated Under Greenhouse Conditions Cultivated plant samples: Mankai biomass is grown in closed controlled highly monitored aquatic greenhouses using a proprietary precision agriculture cultivation system. We sampled the plant for B12 analysis at different seasons during the years 2014 to 2019. Plant biomass was sieve harvested, washed with tap water for 2 min, and dried in a food dehydrator (Excalibur, Sacramento, USA) at 65 °C for 16 h. Each dried plant sample was stored in a vacuum-sealed aluminum bag at 4 °C, until analysis was performed.  Vitamin B12 Detection in Axenic Culture Generating axenic culture: Plant sterilization was achieved by submerging and agitating plants in predetermined concentrations of sodium hypochlorite for 1–3 min. Treated fronds were transferred to a 12-well plate containing sterile Hoagland solution (MgSO4·7H2O 0.",c80bf3ef-4cf3-4f7d-89c6-955336333279

The Hoagland formulation does not contain cobalt compounds. Furthermore, ICP-MS analysis performed by an accredited laboratory was applied to this 10× concentrated Hoagland solution and revealed no cobalt traces (<0.01 ppm). The plate was covered with aluminum foil and kept at 25 °C for 24 h. After the foil was removed, the plants were allowed to recover for an additional 6 days under a 24-h light regime at 120 µE. Bleached mother fronds with green daughter fronds were transferred to a new sterile well to establish a sterile Mankai culture. Three sterile cultures, derived from three independent treatments, were continuously grown in vitamin B12-free Hoagland medium that was replaced once a week.",714697c4-8f99-4791-8ca2-34fa81806464
2,methods2," Culture sterility was verified by incubation of whole and crushed fronds on PCA (plate count agar, Neogen, Michigan, USA) at 30 °C for at least 5 days. Vitamin B12 analysis was performed on 5-month-old independent plant cultures that were intensively washed with running tap water for two minutes and dried in a food dehydrator as described above.  2.1.2. Vitamin B12 Analyses Bioassay Method Total vitamin B12 in the plant samples was measured by the AOAC 952.20 microbiological analytical method, utilizing the B12-requiring bacterium Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC7830, which is the established vitamin B12 determination method for foods [18]. The analysis was performed by Eurofins Laboratories, Inc. (Des Moines, IA, USA) and by Bactochem Ltd. (Nes Ziona, Israel).

Mediterranean (Mediterranean (MED)) group: In addition to the workout program, participants were instructed to adopt a calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet as described in our previous trials: DIRECT [20] and CENTRAL [21] trials, supplemented with 28 g/day of walnuts.  Green Mediterranean (green-Mediterranean (MED)) group: In addition to the Mediterranean intervention (including the provided walnuts), the green Mediterranean dieters were further guided to avoid red and processed meat, with the diet being richer in plants and polyphenols.",35142663-8f3d-4095-b1aa-f3930a427e3d
7,methods7," The participants were guided to further consume the two following provided items: 3–4 cups/day of 100 g frozen cubes of Mankai (whole plant), replacing dinner and a potential source of protein, iron, and vitamin B12. The Mediterranean (MED) and green-Mediterranean (MED) diets were equally calorie restricted (1500–1800 kcal/day for men and 1200–1400 kcal/day for women). All the above (walnuts, green tea, and Mankai) were provided free of charge.  2.2.3. Outcomes Blood samples were taken at 8:00 AM after a 12-h fast, at baseline and after 18 months of intervention. The samples were centrifuged and stored at −80 °C. Serum vitamin B12 was analyzed with a competitive Elektro Chemiluminescence-Immuno Assay “ECLIA” (Cobas 8000, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) using Intrinsic Factor as a binding protein. Serum folate was also measured by the ECLIA competitive approach and was used as a marker for green leaf consumption [22].",047117fa-5a44-448d-bca2-0b3954b2ade3

After donation, fecal samples were kept at 4 °C and 1 g of sample was supplemented with 500 μL of 40% (v/v) anaerobic glycerol solution. The fecal mixtures, consisting of 20 homogenized fecal samples obtained from each donor, were stored in anaerobic freezer bags at −80 °C. Prior to use, 1 mL of fecal mixture was added to a serum bottle filled with 70 mL of anoxic Base medium (see below). The bottle, containing the starter culture, was placed in a shaking incubator for 24 h at 100 rpm and 37 °C.

11,methods11," Media, Anoxic Bioreactor, Mankai Lysate, and Sampling Two anoxic media were used to examine the potential effect of Mankai on human-derived gut microbiota. Both media were based on the protocol described by McDonald et al. [23], with the following modification to provide the same chemical oxygen demand (chemical oxygen demand (COD)) amount (200 meq/L) to all treatments. The final media consisted of an anoxic micronutrient-containing solution and an anoxic macronutrient solution (Table S2). chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured to quantify the reducing equivalents in both solutions. To obtain a (a) base medium for the bioreactors that lacked Mankai and for the starter culture (see above), and (b) Mankai medium for the Mankai-supplemented bioreactors, micronutrient-containing solution, and macronutrient solution were combined, accordingly (Table S2).",6964c816-3985-4c16-9e41-4ea54fb329a3
12,methods12," Before bioreactor inoculation (adding 1 mL of the starter culture (see above)), Mankai lysate was prepared by blending 5 g of frozen Mankai biomass (Wolffia globosa ‘Mankai’) with 400 mL of deionized (DI) water for 5 min and subsequently flushing with nitrogen for 5 min. After inoculation and before the first fill and draw, the bioreactors were incubated for 48 h in the dark at 37 °C and mixed continuously at 100 rpm. Full details regarding the media, anoxic bioreactor, Mankai lysate, and the sampling are provided in Supplementary File S4.  2.3.3.

Content and Stability of Vitamin B12 Levels during Different Seasons Overall, Mankai contained 2.8 ± 0.5 µg B12/100 g dry weight (DW) and the concentration remained relatively stable during the seasons (Figure 1), regardless of the water temperature (17 °C–29 °C) or duration of light hours (10–14): autumn: 2.84 ± 0.5 µg/100 g DW, n = 5 (range: 2.34 µg/100 g to 3.62 µg/100 g DW); winter: 2.83 ± 0.6 µg/100 g DW, n = 5 (range: 1.96 µg/100 g to 3.44 µg/100 g DW); spring: 2.94 ± 0.",29e1d6a6-a5c8-4299-b139-79fdb290d14d
14,methods14,"6 µg/100 g DW, n = 4 (range: 2.19 µg /100 g to 3.52 µg/100 g DW); and summer: 2.6 ± 0.5 µg/100 g DW, n = 6 (range: 1.83 µg/100 g to 3.26 µg/100 g DW). (p = 0.76 between seasons).  3.1.2. Inherent Presence of Vitamin B12 in Mankai Axenic Cultures B12 concentrations in three independent axenic cultures, which were vegetatively propagated for at least 5 months post establishment, were 2.08, 2.34, and 1.6 µg/100 g DW.  3.1.3. Identification of Vitamin B12 Purified from Mankai To verify that the corrinoid detected by the bioassay was indeed a bioactive form of cobalamin, we used LC-MS/MS. The presence of the active form was validated in all 10 tested samples: four plant samples representing three different seasons (spring, summer, and autumn) and 6 samples grown under indoor conditions. Representative data of a Mankai sample collected during mid-March 2019 from an outdoor basin are shown in Figure 2. Standard CN-B12 was eluted as a peak with a retention time of 2.",2f95eb58-97a7-4933-8a84-3c6463845e4b
15,methods15,"11 min (Figure 2A) and the plant extract sample showed a corresponding peak with the same retention time (Figure 2B) for all Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) transitions. The intensity ratios between individual Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) signals were kept similar in both standard and plant samples (Figure S2).  3.1.4. Quantification of Total Vitamin B12 Purified from Mankai The extractions described above were performed in the presence of KCN, which converts the naturally occurring forms of cobalamin to the stable CN-B12 form. Since this conversion is not always complete [26], we analyzed all four vitamin B12 forms by LC-MS/MS, with the aim of determining the total vitamin B12 content of Mankai. Commercial OH-B12, CN-B12, Ado-B12, and Me-B12 standards were eluted as peaks with retention times of 1.87, 2.1, 2.25, and 2.31 min, respectively, and the plant extract samples showed corresponding peaks with the same retention times (Figure S3).",68515b7b-417c-40db-8a58-8036d1df7382
16,methods16," The intensity ratios between individual Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) signals were kept similar in both standard and plant samples (data not shown). These results indicate that all three natural forms were present in Mankai and that incomplete conversion to CN-B12 had occurred. The identification of CN-B12, OH-B12, Ado-B12, and Me-B12 was further validated by four, three, two, and four Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM)s, respectively. In order to calculate the total vitamin B12 in the plants, we measured the recovery rate of each form by analyzing the standards, with or without immunoaffinity column purification. Namely, the solutions containing the standard mix of four B12 forms in equal amounts were divided in two halves. One half was diluted with acetate buffer and passed through a EASI-EXTRACT vitamin B12 immunoaffinity column according to the manufacturer’s purification protocol. The obtained eluate was evaporated and re-dissolved to the same volume as the second half.",d0c9f477-4ebd-48a2-a69f-0b017bc9cdb9
17,methods17," Samples thus obtained were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The results showed recovery rates of 55%, 37%, 16%, and 100% for CN-B12, OH-B12, Ado-B12, and Me-B12, respectively. The analysis was performed on three plant samples that were obtained from greenhouse cultivation basins during spring, summer, and autumn. The amount of each form was then measured in plant extracts and the total B12 level was calculated according to the recovery rates. The data showed that the average total authentic vitamin B12 concentrations in Mankai is 3.23 µg ± 0.5/100 g DW and stable during different seasons: spring 2.86 µg, summer 3.84 µg, and autumn 2.99 µg/100 g DW. These concentrations are in line with the results received by the bioassay method.  3.1.5. Authentic CN-B12 and Pseudo CN-B12 in Mankai To further study Mankai as a vitamin B12 food source, we estimated the concentrations of pseudo B12 in the plant.",0bc792bf-3437-44f9-9ea2-9005a96014a2
18,methods18," To this end, we used LC-MS/MS to analyze samples of spirulina that are known to produce large amounts of pseudo B12 [27] and therefore can be used as a reference. This measurement was performed assuming similar ionization products for both CN-B12 and pseudo CN-B12, so the standard CN-B12 curve was used as a reference to quantify both compounds. Based on the different molecular masses of CN-B12 and pseudo CN-B12, the data revealed the presence of CN-B12 and pseudo CN-B12 in a ratio 1:3 in two different spirulina samples, whereas no pseudo CN-B12 was detected in the Mankai samples (Figure 3 and Figure S4).  3.2. DIRECT PLUS Trial 3.2.1. Baseline Characteristics The baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. The mean vitamin B12 concentration was 420.4 ± 187.8 pg/mL (range: 150–1500 pg/mL), with a mean of 414.3 ± 182.5 pg/mL for men and 465.5 ± 220.9 pg/mL for women (p = 0.21 between sexes).",4ec1163b-5401-4361-84fb-faadc5ebbe06

Both Mediterranean (MED) groups increased egg and milk consumption compared with the Healthy dietary guidelines (HDG) group [16]. Vitamin supplementation usage at the end of the intervention did not differ between the intervention groups (Supplementary File S6).  Differences in serum vitamin B12 concentrations between intervention groups are presented in Figure 4.

Those who decreased red meat intake throughout the intervention showed a significantly increased serum folate associated with more frequent intake of Mankai (p of trend < 0.05; Figure S5a). Across all intervention groups, among those who decreased red meat consumption, increased serum folate was associated with increased serum vitamin B12 (p < 0.05) (Figure 5).

Significant increases in serum folate and vitamin B12 were observed for participants who both consumed more fish and Mankai, and demonstrated an increase in serum folate levels, as compared with other groups (Figure S5b,c).  No significant difference between extreme groups less red meat/most increase in serum folate and more red meat/most reduction in serum folate was observed.  3.3. Anoxic Bioreactors Pilot Experiment Predicted Functional Pathways-Gut Bioreactor Based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences obtained from all bioreactors at the end of incubation (day 14), we predicted KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) present in the genomes of the bacteria identified, using Predicted functional profile analysis via PICRUSt [29].",c2c076ff-62c0-4a45-a6b5-117c21e33868
24,methods24," This analysis, allowing us to predict KEGGS and the linear discriminant analysis effect size (linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEFSE)), showed that Mankai-supplemented bioreactors displayed a significantly higher relative abundance of 16S rRNA gene sequences associated with a genome containing a KEGG ortholog involved in vitamin B12 uptake (btuB; KEGG identifier K16092) than control bioreactors that lacked Mankai. Statistical analyses revealed a linear discriminant analysis (linear discriminant analysis (LDA)) score of 2.19 (log10) and a relative btuB abundance of 0.034 ± 0.008 and 0.00 ± 0.001 in Mankai-supplemented reactors and reactors that lacked Mankai, respectively (p < 0.05 between reactors).  In total, 1180 of 5257 different 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences were identified in the three replicated Mankai-supplemented bioreactors that contributed to the increased predicted abundance of microbes containing btuB.",05999994-17df-4096-b241-e2f7ffb3d9d0
25,methods25," Six 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences displayed a greater than 0.5% relative 16S rRNA gene amplicon abundance, and three of these sequences (closely related to Aeromonas hydrophila, Pelomonas aquatica, and Geobacter anodireducens) were present in all three replicated Mankai-supplemented bioreactors (Figure S3). In marked contrast, only nine different 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences—associated with microbes potentially containing btuB—were identified in the control reactors that lacked Mankai, of which (a) five of these nine were present in all three replicates and (b) only one sequence (closely related to Escherichia coli) displayed a relative abundance greater than 0.5% (Table S3).  4. Discussion In the current study, we examined, using different methodologies, the presence of vitamin B12 in a cultivated strain of Wolffia globosa (Mankai).",c04e2524-406b-4e0d-93ed-8146672bb12b
26,methods26," We found that Mankai, cultured under closed-controlled greenhouse conditions, contains a substantial amount of the known bioactive forms of vitamin B12 and that its presence is stable throughout the year. In inoculated gut microbiome anoxic bioreactors, a significantly higher relative abundance of 16S rRNA gene sequences associated with a genome containing the KEGG ortholog involved in vitamin B12 uptake was observed, compared with control bioreactors that lacked Mankai. In our human studies, results suggest that long-term consumption of this plant, as part of a whole flexitarian diet, may increase rather than impair vitamin B12 levels, without additional red meat intake. To our knowledge, this is the first reported study on the B12 content and bioavailability in duckweed and specifically in Wolffia globosa.",138a7fad-a1bc-42b4-97aa-222809e377af
27,methods27,"  Although some evidence for the presence of vitamin B12 in Actinorhizal plants has been reported [28], it is generally recognized that vitamin B12 is absent from plant-derived food sources [1,2,5,30]. Plants neither require nor synthesize vitamin B12 because they contain no cobalamin-dependent enzymes and instead encode a B12-independent form of methionine synthase [31]. To carefully examine our hypothesis regarding the presence of vitamin B12 in Mankai, we analyzed, over a period of 5 years, samples that were obtained from intensively grown plant cultures. Repeated microbiological assay analyses revealed the presence of stable levels of vitamin B12 in Mankai. Furthermore, to exclude B12 presence due to absorption from an external source, we tested vitamin B12 in axenic Mankai cultures, generated by propagating a green daughter frond that emerged from a bleached mother frond, for several months under sterile conditions.",e06f3289-0cda-4bce-adf2-23c9a579c1b5
28,methods28," We speculated that in Mankai plants grown under these conditions, the level of any absorbed vitamin B12 from an external source, such as occasional bacteria or microalgal contamination, would be expected to decline and probably become undetectable in the axenic culture as the plants propagated for successive generations in the sterile culture and as the biomass increased by several orders. However, B12 analysis performed on cultures that were propagated for at least 5 months, under sterile conditions in a B12-free medium, revealed similar levels of the vitamin. Since the results described above were obtained by the microbiological assay method, the reliability of which was recently put in question because lactic bacterium, L. delbrueckii, was found to be able to utilize other corrinoids as well [1], we decided to further study the B12 nature in the Mankai plant tissue.  The LC-MS/MS method is a reliable method to analyze and identify vitamin B12 and its congeneric forms.",e445c722-a31e-45b9-8d50-8c62d5628f6f
29,methods29," We analyzed the four major forms of the vitamin: OH-B12, Ado-B12, Me-B12, and CN-B12 in all Mankai samples. The results revealed the presence of all four B12 forms in the Mankai samples. It is well known that in animal cells, Me-B12 serves as a cofactor for methionine synthase, while Ado-B12 is a cofactor of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. However, plants contain no cobalamin-dependent enzymes [31] and therefore, while one can assume that these metabolites do not play a biological role in Mankai plants, it remains possible that the coenzyme forms of B12 are produced in endophytic bacteria, which are the presumed source of the B12. As the analysis was performed using the KCN extraction method, we were unable to assess the original content of each of the three natural B12 forms in Mankai. However, we were able to determine the total level of B12 in Mankai, and importantly, these results were comparable to the microbiological assay method.",66a10938-bbd4-41e6-a099-e729636a771d
30,methods30," Moreover, we further investigated the presence of pseudo B12 due to reports on the identification of large quantities of this compound in non-animal food sources, such as algae [27]. Since pseudo CN-B12 is not commercially available, we used spirulina extracts as a reference source of pseudo CN-B12 and compared it with Mankai extracts. Under the LC-MS/MS conditions used in this study, no pseudo CN-B12 forms bearing identity with the pseudo CN-B12 seen in the spirulina extract were detected in any of the Mankai samples. Therefore, the bioassay analysis is a reliable method to measure vitamin B12 levels in Mankai.  Although the affinity of the gastric intrinsic factor binding protein for authentic B12 is 500 times greater than for pseudo B12 [32,33], according to Herbert and Drivas [34], non-cobalamin vitamin B12 analogues, produced by algae and other organisms, may interfere with vitamin B12 metabolism. A recent study by Bito et al.",cd42cfad-8c2e-4496-9e3d-da457d2b3b2a
31,methods31," demonstrated that pseudo B12 can inhibit transcobalamin II-mediated absorption in mammalian cultured COS-7 cells [35].  Functional microbial composition analysis based on genome prediction and sequence matching of microbes in reactors that were inoculated with human fecal samples indicated that Mankai-supplemented reactors displayed a significantly enhanced relative abundance of 16S rRNA gene sequences of microorganisms that have the gene required to produce the vitamin B12 transporter BtuB. BtuB, located in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is essential for the active uptake of cobalamin across the outer membrane [36]. We could infer that the increased abundance in gut microorganisms that produce the vitamin B12 transporter is due to the increased abundance of thisvitamin B12 in the Mankai reactors. Vitamin B12 is an essential cofactor in several microbial anaerobic processes (e.g.",6340b4ad-6d2a-4999-b940-e3c5277377db
32,methods32,", propionate fermentation, butyrate fermentation via 3-methylaspartate, methanogenesis), suggesting that this vitamin has the potential to stimulate fermentation and, thus, the production of short-chain fatty acids [37,38,39,40,41], which provide many benefits to the host [42].  The origin of the vitamin B12 in Mankai was not determined in this study, but we speculate that it is derived from an endophyte bacterial source. The fact that we did find B12 in the axenic cultures does not negate this hypothesis as axenic duckweed cultures, although often termed in the literature as “sterile” cultures, may still contain a plant tissue that carries microbes, in its internal core, as described by Gilbert et al. [12]. One may reasonably assume that a single or several such endophytic bacteria are responsible for the production of B12 found in Mankai.",da3deea6-5ac3-48e2-a77f-30f496cff6b3
33,methods33,"  Collectively, these results indicate that the presence of B12 in Mankai is not an occasional event nor a result of uptake from the surrounding medium but is stably and consistently produced within or in close association with the plant. Further studies should be conducted to identify the vitamin B12-producing bacteria and characterize their interaction with the plant. These studies may lead to novel strategies for B12 enrichment in Mankai and would contribute to its nutritional value as a potential vitamin B12 food source, particularly for individuals who prefer a vegetarian lifestyle or who eschew any animal products in their diet.  The recommended dietary allowance of vitamin B12 for adults is set at 2.4 μg/day [43]. The vitamin B12 content in Mankai, according to our repeated analyses, is about 0.5 μg/20 g DW (equivalent to 100 g of frozen Mankai, as given to our participants as a green dinner shake), thus making it a desirable plant substitute.",48c5d0b9-b90c-4095-af5c-79982e5cbd2d
34,methods34," Although advised to completely reduce red meat intake, we observed a significant increase in vitamin B12 levels among participants who were under a semi-vegetarian weight loss diet, compared with participants who, although advised to adopt a healthy lifestyle, did not significantly change their routine red meat intake. It has to be noted that a significant trend in vitamin B12 increase was observed between the intervention groups, even though the green-Mediterranean (MED) dieters were instructed to avoid red/processed meat and their diet was further fortified with Mankai shake and green tea. In addition, participants who reduced red meat had an increase in serum folate (a marker for green leafy vegetable consumption [22]), and in this study for Mankai consumption [17] had an increase in vitamin B12 comparable to participants who increased red meat and had a decrease in serum folate levels.",82420afb-d8d0-443b-81a8-61bd1b6578eb
35,methods35," Reducing red meat consumption, especially processed meat products, has been a focus of attention in recent years, due to increasing evidence of the association between meat consumption and health risks [44]. However, reducing red meat, as vegan or some vegetarian eating patterns suggest, might put one at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, which could result in megaloblastic anemia and neurological damage [45,46]. Vegetarians and vegans in particular are at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency and infants born to mothers who follow such diets run a risk of neurodevelopmental abnormalities and feeding difficulties [47]. Therefore, the identification of a natural alternative vitamin B12 source would be of major interest to nutrition professionals.  Natural sources of authentic vitamin B12 include red meat and fish but also dairy and eggs [31,46]. However, it is well known that growing cattle for food requires a lot of land, water, and energy, and generates considerable waste [48,49].",d0849981-80e4-4ed4-9cdb-9b10befb0916
36,methods36," In the search for a sustainable vitamin B12 source, it has been reported that some plant foods (e.g., mushrooms and edible Algae) are rich in corrinoids, but those foods either lack the bioactive form of vitamin B12, must be consumed in impractical amounts, or because of controversial data are a questionable source of bioavailable B12 [50,51,52]. Alternatively, insects have been proposed as a promising source of food for vitamin B12. Mealworms, grasshoppers, crickets, and cockroaches were studied regarding their content of bioactive vitamin B12 but exhibited marked variations in their vitamin B12 content [53]. Moreover, esthetic, religious, and psychological barriers may further limit their use as a source of vitamin B12 replacement.  The limitations of this study include the inability to assess the origin of the vitamin B12 in the plant, as well as the bioavailability and specific digestibility pathway of vitamin B12 directly among our human participants.",99d12e5d-73f8-4b8d-9864-bb1b0994fb4f
37,methods37," The bioassay method, based on the B12-requiring bacteria Lactobacillus Delbrueckii, cannot determine whether Mankai contains cobalamin or inactive corrinoids or both [1]. However, the fact that the LC-MS/MS method, which is a direct physico-chemical assay for B12, revealed comparable levels to the bioassay method indicates that, in the case of Mankai, the bioassay results reflect solely the concentrations of authentic B12 forms and not analogues. We were also not able to isolate Mankai as a sole source of vitamin B12 from other dietary components rich in vitamin B12 in the long-term human trial. In order to overcome this limitation, we presented additional analyses from the electronic questionnaires of other B12 sources.",30b26065-cc49-4781-9094-49ff0779cc2c
38,methods38," We did not measure homocysteine or methylmalonic acid, which might better reflect metabolic deficiencies of vitamin B12 or serum folate [54], thus we cannot evaluate the effect of the intervention in cases with low B12 and high levels of these serum/plasma markers indicative of biochemical B12 deficiency. Furthermore, our participants had baseline serum B12 levels within the normal range, so, although we could observe significant increases, we could not demonstrate efficacy for correction of B12 deficiency status and further studies should be carried out to examine this question. We also cannot point out the exact mechanism that explains the substantial B12 content in the Mankai plant, nor the way in which this may be controlled in the plant tissue. The data we showed for our bioreactors are from a small pilot study, and we consider them preliminary.",a37e95f2-5a7e-4c4f-b3ef-5ba86d9540ce
39,methods39," Thus, an open question remains concerning the possibility that the Mankai plant may modify the microbiota in the intestinal tract with possible effects on the bioavailability of B12 normally present in bile [5]. Strengths of the data that we report here include the comprehensive multi-assessment of several aspects of B12, including laboratory, gut-related, and a long-term human randomized controlled trial, with monitored lunch and daily supply of Mankai to the participants.  5. Conclusions The Mankai plant contains bioactive B12 compounds and could potentially serve as a plant-based food source of vitamin B12. Results from this study could provide additional insight regarding a much-needed alternative healthy and sustainable B12 source. ",27191df2-157b-402e-94b8-b26f18d175f5
