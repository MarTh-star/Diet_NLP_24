ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04036357) including 655 consecutive Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. The Plinio study is a prospective observational cohort study aimed to detect non-conventional factors associated with the progression of liver fibrosis in patients with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  We enrolled patients referred to the Day Service of Internal Medicine and Metabolic Disorders of the Policlinico Umberto I University Hospital in Rome with at least one out of the following cardio-metabolic diseases: metabolic syndrome (MetS), overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, or atrial fibrillation (AF).",0e0c1e7f-56c8-4ac9-82e8-0922a0e30362

Patients presenting inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria underwent liver ultrasound (US). Only patients with evidence of liver steatosis were included in the present analysis.  Anthropometric data (i.e., waist circumference and body mass index, BMI), and clinical and drug history were registered. The presence of cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors was defined according to international guidelines [31,32,33]. Routine clinical and biochemical evaluations were performed.  Liver US scanning was performed to assess the presence of steatosis.",a05e3381-84c8-429c-aac8-68efbbbdc23e
2,methods2," All US were performed by the same operator who was blinded to laboratory values using a GE Vivid S6 apparatus equipped with a convex 3.5 MHz probe; fatty liver was defined according to Hamaguchi score. Hamaguchi score was calculated as follow: echoes intensity arising from liver parenchyma with presence or absence of liver-kidney contrast (0–3 points), clarity of diaphragm visualization (0–2 points), and clarity of liver blood vessel structure (0–1 point). A score of 0 points excluded the presence of steatosis, a score ≥ 1, in presence of increased liver parenchyma echoes, was considered diagnostic for the presence of liver steatosis [34].

Patients’ Charachteristics According to Med-Diet Adherence  We included 655 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients from the PLINIO study. Mean age was 54.9 ± 11.7 years and 38.6% were female. The median Med-Diet Score was 5 (4–6) points. According to score cut offs 10.2%, 74.3%, and 15.4% of the participants had low, intermediate, and high adherence to the Med-Diet, respectively. Patients with low adherence, as compared to those with high adherence, were younger, had higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (70.",8974da60-3ebe-4ad7-866b-c2a639ff370a

At multivariate logistic regression analysis, high adherence to the Med-Diet (score > 6 pts) associated with TxB2 (III tertile vs. I tertile: OR = 0.55, p = 0.023 and II tertile vs. I tertile: OR = 0.56, p = 0.038) after correction for age > 65 years, sex, metabolic syndrome, and antiplatelet therapy. in addition, aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) > 0.7 associated with TxB2 (III tertile vs. I tertile: OR = 2.39, p = 0.039) (Table 3).  Performing additional multivariate analyses using each food score items instead of the Med-Diet adherence score, TxB2 (II vs. I tertile: OR = 0.45, p < 0.001, III vs. I tertile: OR = 0.57, p = 0.004) correlated with low meat consumption (meat < 1 serving/day) after correction for age > 65 years, sex, metabolic syndrome, antiplatelet therapy and aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) > 0.",1b9ec78f-f769-43b3-a2b3-38a8f30dc584
8,methods9,"7 (Figure 1).  3.3. Med-Diet Score and Pro-C3  In the whole population the mean Pro-C3 was 7.2 ± 2.6 ng/mL and decreased progressively from subjects with low Med-Diet adherence to those with intermediate and high adherence (7.8 ± 3.0 vs. 7.3 ± 2.7 vs. 6.3 ± 1.7 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.001). No differences in mean Pro-C3 were found according to specific antiplatelet drugs (Table S2).  At univariate analysis, a negative correlation was observed between the Med-Diet score and Pro-C3 (rS = −0.135; p < 0.001). After correction for age, sex, total-c/HDL-c, glycaemia, and BMI, Pro-C3 associated with the Med-Diet score (Beta = −0.12; p = 0.002) and aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) (Beta = 0.10, p = 0.008) (Table 4).  At multivariate logistic regression analysis, high adherence to the Med-Diet (score > 6 pts) was associated with Pro-C3 (III vs. I tertile: OR = 0.48, p = 0.010) after correction for sex, metabolic syndrome, and antiplatelet therapy.",e13cc228-2058-4387-9a4f-2d58a7fe77da

When in the multivariate analyses, the individual food items scores were included as independent variables instead of the Med-Diet score, no statistically significant associations with Pro-C3 tertiles were observed (data not showed).  At univariate analysis, TxB2 and Pro-C3 were positively correlated (r = 0.110; p = 0.005). The correlation was also confirmed after adjustment for age and sex (Beta = 0.106; p = 0.007).  4. Discussion  The beneficial effects of the Med-Diet were widely proved. Previous studies have demonstrated anti-inflammatory [38] and antioxidant effects in both the general population [39] and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients [24].",61ca2f61-0fa7-4056-8842-fa16bf1ea984
10,methods11," Instead, this is the first study proving an inverse correlation between Med-Diet adherence, circulating platelet activation marker, and liver collagen deposition in patients with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  Platelet activation is a key moment in atherothrombotic processes leading to CVD. CVD is the first cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [40,41]. While impaired lipid profile [42], diabetes [43], endothelial dysfunction [44], and oxidative stress [45,46] were investigated as possible risk factors in Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, few studies have addresses platelet activation as a cardiovascular risk marker.",e54cfa5c-011b-451b-a4c0-b181397ab318
11,methods12," Some authors have suggested mean platelet volume (mean platelet volume (MPV)), a reliable marker of platelet hyperactivity and CV risk [47], as a risk marker in Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, and have included mean platelet volume (MPV) in a risk score for CV events in these patients [43].  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting TxB2 levels in a large population of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients and investigating the relationship between TxB2 and adherence to the Med-Diet in this setting. Serum TxB2, produced by the non-enzymatic hydration of thromboxane A2, which is produced in turn by platelet cyclooxygenase 1 [48], reflects the body production of TxB2 and is a reliable marker of platelet activation ex vivo [49].",83a3a4d0-dc8a-4cf1-a37d-1037f36dc4b6
12,methods13," Whereas in other settings, such as atrial fibrillation [50] and pneumonia [51], the relationship between platelet activation, the Med-Diet, and cardiovascular events is well described, to date, there are no prospective data on the association between Med-Diet adherence, TxB2, and cardiovascular events in Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients.  Our data also demonstrate for the first time that the lower the adherence to the Med-Diet, the higher the values of serum Pro-C3, confirming that the Med-Diet might be associated with a less severe Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Serum Pro-C3, cleaved during collagen III deposition, is a circulating marker of fibrogenesis that progressively increase with fibrosis stage and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score (NAFLD activity score (NAS)) [19]. Of interest, we found a direct correlation between Pro-C3 and aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), a noninvasive score of liver fibrosis.",f0987afd-0abc-4446-8fcd-ae9309b38c6e
13,methods14," In accordance with our data, a previous study form Kontogianni MD et al. showed an inverse correlation between Med-Diet adherence and both liver fibrosis (diagnosed with histology or liver stiffness measurement) and NAFLD activity score (NAS)H diagnosis [52].  When we analyzed the single food items of the Med-Diet score, we found that none of them associated with higher values of Pro-C3, suggesting a role of the Med-Diet as a whole in influencing collagen liver deposition.  Instead, performing a further analysis including TxB2, we found that lower consumption of meat (less than 1 serving/week) associates with lower levels of serum TxB2, suggesting a less severe Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients who eat less meat. Differently, Pignatelli et al. [29] demonstrated that, in atrial fibrillation patients, high olive oil consumption inversely correlated with the level of TxA2 production.  Our data could partially be explained by previous findings. Ahmad M.I.",5a4ccd63-243e-4f3b-acbb-c65591149d68
14,methods15," and colleagues [53], linked diets rich in red meat and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk via the high oxidative stress induced by this dietary pattern. Interestingly, we previously demonstrated, although in different settings, the association between low adherence to the Mediterranean diet and both high circulating level of lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), markers of gut bacterial products translocation and systemic oxidative stress, respectively [24,54]. Oxidative stress is a well-known factor inducing platelet activation [55] and could represent the link between meat consumption and impaired platelet activation.  In addition, we found an independent association between TxB2 and Pro-C3 that might confirm a role of platelet activity in liver damage as also supported by the association between TxB2 and aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI).",da4d50e3-a1d0-476f-bed9-08de0957986c
15,methods16,"  Finally, this study confirms, as previously observed [23], that older patients adhere more to the Med-Diet than younger ones. This finding is in agreement with that observed in other Italian study populations [56]. The trend of Mediterranean youth to prefer Western dietary habits was widely discussed in the literature in the last years [57,58] and was summarized in a systematic review [59]. This has been related to the more frequent habits to have launch away from home because of work [57]. Interestingly, in the last 2 years, during COVID19 pandemic, young adults [18–30 years] paid more attention to eating Med-Diet foods [60].  Our findings have clinical implication, adding evidence on the beneficial role of the Med-Diet in preventing both Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression and cardiovascular disease in this setting.",6cea2d0d-ba98-4ab3-8a79-2456bbd84db8
16,methods17," Previous studies already proved that high adherence to the Med-Diet induces effective weight loss, liver fat, and total mass fat reduction, liver stiffness, and ALT improvement [61,62,63]. Of note, the Med-Diet score we used was validated in a study aimed to the quantitative estimation of adherence to a cardioprotective Mediterranean diet [37], giving even more strength to the association between Med-Diet adherence and TxB2 we found.  Our study has also some limitations. Its observational and cross-sectional design does not allow the establishment of a cause–effect relationship between Med-Diet adherence, impaired platelet activity, and liver collagen deposition. In addition, the Med-Diet short questionnaire we used was not designed to investigate single nutrient intake and we therefore could not investigate the association between serum TxB2 and Pro-C3 with specific nutrients.",946d6964-d409-4cd9-9acb-ec74537644b5
17,methods18," Finally, despite US scanning being the most suitable imaging test to diagnose liver steatosis, due its cost-effectiveness and high specificity, it has a low diagnostic sensitivity for mild steatosis.  5. Conclusions  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients high adhering to the Med-Diet show lower platelet activation and liver collagen III deposition, suggesting a protective role of the Med-Diet against Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression and cardiovascular risk. In addition, the positive correlation between serum TxB2 and Pro-C3 may suggest a link between Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) severity and the level of cardiovascular risk.
