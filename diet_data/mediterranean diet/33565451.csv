0,methods0," Study Design and Population  This cross-sectional study analyzed the data of 12,317 adults (4,886 males and 7,431 females) aged 20–64 years from the KNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)-VI 2013–2016. The participants were selected using a complex, stratified, multistage probability cluster survey to obtain a large representative sample of South Korean civilians (14). Health status data were collected by The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. Health status was assessed using interviews, surveys, and physical examinations. The survey components and data collection methods have been detailed previously (22). The Institutional Review Board of the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (approval no. 2013-07CON-03-4C) approved the KNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, revised in 2008.",05c3b32d-8cce-4db2-a63a-2d895394853b
1,methods1," The participants provided written informed consent to participate in this study.  Data Collection and Variable Definitions  The health interview included age, gender, residence, education, income, alcohol intake, tobacco use, and regular exercise. Height and weight were measured with the participant wearing light clothing and no shoes. Obesity status was classified according to the recommendations of the International Obesity Task Force and the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) Regional Office for Asians as follows: lean, body mass index (BMI) <18.5 kg/m2; normal, body mass index (BMI) ≥18.5– <25 kg/m2), and obese, body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2 (22). Area of residence was categorized into five regions: (1) Seoul, Incheon, Kyunggi area, and Gangwon-area; (2) Chunngchung area, Daejeon, and Sejong; (3) Kyungbook and Daegu; (4) Busan and Kyungnam area; and (5) Jeonbuk and Jeonnam areas, Kwangju, and Jeju areas (14, 17).",e67e3116-3994-4ccf-80ad-23ef75c40cbd
2,methods2," Education level was categorized into < high school, high school, and ≥college. Family income was divided into four quartiles.  Usual alcohol intake was estimated by multiplying the average frequency (days per month) with the average amount of alcohol consumed on a single occasion determined in mL and by the type of alcoholic drinks ingested on a single occasion. Alcohol intake was converted into pure alcohol (in grams) consumed per day. Drinking habits were classified as none, mild (1–15 g), moderate (16–30 g), or heavy (>30 g) based on previous studies on the influence of alcohol consumption on alcohol-related diseases (23). Smokers were defined as smoking more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, while past smokers were specified as smokers who had not smoked for the last 6 months (23).",93281d7e-d981-4636-a062-cb46b6425130
3,methods3,"  Regular exercise was defined as having ≥30 min of moderate exercise, including swimming slowly, playing doubles tennis or volleyball, and participating in occupational or recreational activities carrying light objects, at least 5 times per week or ≥20 min of vigorous exercise at least three times per week. The vigorous exercise included running, climbing, cycling fast, swimming fast, playing football, basketball, squash, singles tennis, jumping rope, and participating in occupational or recreational activities while carrying heavy objects (23). Marital status was categorized into married, divorced, widowed, and single.  Abdominal Obesity Criteria  Abdominal obesity was defined using the cutoff of waist circumferences according to the World Health Organization guidelines for Asians and the Korean Obesity Society (24). The cutoff values for abdominal obesity were ≥90 cm in men and ≥85 cm in women (24).",20713205-ed5d-4cdd-b425-e42903132eaa
4,methods4," According to this criterion, the participants were divided into the abdominal obesity and control groups.  Laboratory Tests  Serum was separated from blood samples collected after overnight fasting (at least 12 h). Serum glucose, high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)), triglyceride (TG), aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase concentrations were measured using an autoanalyzer (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL)) concentrations were estimated using the Friedwald equation as follows: low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) = total cholesterol – high density lipoprotein (HDL) – (TG/5), when TG was <400 mg/dL (15, 23). Serum TG concentrations were directly measured on a Hitachi 7,600 auto-analyzer in participants with ≥400 mg/dL. All biochemical assays were conducted at the Neodin Medical Institute, a laboratory certified by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare.",6209e7c6-f06b-4cbd-a8b3-33ac74bd587b
5,methods5,"  Food and Nutrient Intakes From 24-h Recall and Food Frequency Questionnaire  Participants were asked about their usual food intake and dietary habits before the interview. Daily nutrient intake was estimated using a 24-h recall questionnaire administered by trained dieticians at mobile examination centers. Daily energy and nutrient intake were calculated using the Can-Pro 2.0, a nutrient assessment program developed by the Korean Nutrition Society. The nutrient intake from the 24-h recall was used for daily nutrient intake.  Usual food intake was determined using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire (SQFFQ)) designed and validated by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (18, 22). This semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire (SQFFQ) questionnaire assessed the frequency and consumption amount of 113 food items during the previous year.",d219e620-d0e6-4bb2-84a9-3ade434f4381
6,methods6," Frequencies were checked using the following nine categories: never or seldom, once a month, 2–3 times a month, 1–2 times a week, 3–4 times a week, 5–6 times a week, once a day, twice a day, and three times or more every day (23). For foods consumed only once, the amount was categorized as half, one, or 1.5 of regular size.  Modified Korean Healthy Eating Index (MKhealthy eating index (HEI)) for Abdominal Obesity Risk  The KCDC designed and developed the Khealthy eating index (HEI) to assess dietary quality in Koreans comprehensively. It includes the adequacy of food intake; appropriateness of saturated fat, sugar, and sodium intake; and balance of energy, fat, and carbohydrate intakes (25). Khealthy eating index (HEI) scores were calculated using semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire (SQFFQ) data. The Khealthy eating index (HEI) is composed of adequacy (8 items), moderation (3 items), and balance (3 items) domains of energy intake.",815b3490-aa06-455c-843b-b7507b8c73d7
7,methods7," The scores of each item in adequacy part, moderation, and balance were described in a previous study (20). The Khealthy eating index (HEI) scores were assigned using data from the Dietary Guidelines for Korean Adults and dietary reference intake for Koreans in 2015 (26).  We modified the Khealthy eating index (HEI) to determine the effects of the primary components of Korean balanced diet (KBD) on abdominal obesity risk. MKhealthy eating index (HEI) scores were assessed based on the semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire (SQFFQ) data. The intakes of fermented vegetables, seaweed, fish, beans with fermented beans, and nuts were joined to MKhealthy eating index (HEI) for the adequacy item. The moderation item also included fast food and noodle intake based on energy percentage. Vitamin C, fiber, and calcium intakes were added to the MKhealthy eating index (HEI) for the balance item. The maximum scores for each item in the MKhealthy eating index (HEI) are provided in Table 1.",70e258cb-43cd-4f37-b90a-c2ddcc6f8cae
8,methods8," Each item was given a score from 0–5 or 0–10, with the total score ranging from 0 to 150. Higher scores in each item indicate healthier diets than lower scores. The standards of additional items were assigned based on the recommendations of the Food and Agriculture Organization and Korean dietary guidelines (25).

Statistical differences were determined using chi-squared tests. Adjusted means and 95% CI of the MKhealthy eating index (HEI) scores and mean intakes of major nutrients were analyzed using the Satterthwaite chi-square test according to gender. Finally, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the risk of abdominal obesity according to the MKhealthy eating index (HEI) tertile scores were calculated using logistic regression after adjusting for age and residence area for model 1, covariates in model 1 plus occupation, income, education, and marital status for model 2, and covariates in the model 2 plus alcohol intake, smoking status, and physical activity for model 3.

The incidence of abdominal obesity was higher in men than women (P < 0.01), while it increased with age (P < 0.01). It was higher in participants living in rural areas than in the city. The participants with higher education and income were a much lower incidence of abdominal obesity (P < 0.01; Table 2). Current smokers had lower abdominal obesity incidence than non-smokers and past-smokers, while mild drinkers had lower incidence than the others (P < 0.01; Table 2). Married individuals had a higher incidence of abdominal obesity than unmarried ones. The rate of abdominal obesity was markedly higher in the 2015 and 2016 surveys than in the 2013 and 2014 surveys (Table 2).",7d9cca23-a0f1-415c-be2d-2fa55d5eb9cc

24,discussion0," The present study showed that the total scores of the MKhealthy eating index (HEI) and scores of Korean balanced diet (KBD), but not those of Western style diet (WSD), were inversely associated with abdominal obesity only in women. Daily energy intake was tended to be higher in the abdominal obesity group than the control group in men (P = 0.089) and women (P = 0.055), although it was close to being estimated energy requirement (estimated energy intake requirement (EER)) of the participants. However, macronutrient intakes were not significantly different between the abdominal obesity and normal-weight control groups. Therefore, the adherence to Korean healthy eating patterns reflecting Korean balanced diet (KBD) has the potential to protect against abdominal obesity risk, especially in females. This study was the first study to show that a healthy eating pattern based on Korean balanced diet (KBD) can benefit abdominal obesity prevention in women.",fd0ed995-820a-458f-8265-62e6bb3866fb
25,discussion1,"  Waist circumference as an indicator of abdominal obesity is associated with metabolic diseases. Although an energy imbalance mainly causes obesity, it is challenging to sustain balance for long periods. Not all obese persons consume higher energy intake than non-obese persons, and unhealthy eating habits are associated with abdominal obesity. In contrast, healthy eating habits are associated with health benefits, including preventing obesity, metabolic diseases, and certain cancers (10). The Mediterranean diet is recommended for a healthy eating pattern in Western countries to prevent obesity (10). However, it is challenging to apply the Mediterranean diet to the dietary patterns of Asians. Previous studies using KNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data have demonstrated that healthy eating patterns, including Korean balanced diet (KBD), are inversely associated with the risk of metabolic syndrome and are positively associated with cardiovascular age (17, 27).",1110ee2d-8de8-4da9-a3c1-3a9d786cf910
26,discussion2,"  The prevalence of metabolic syndrome has increased from 2008 to 2017 in men but not in women (28). The prevalence of high waist circumference and serum triglyceride concentrations has also only increased in men. Further, although body mass index (BMI) changes are minimal (29), the proportion of participants with high blood pressure and fasting serum glucose concentrations increased from 2008 to 2017 in both genders (28, 29). These increases may be associated with lifestyle changes, including smoking, alcohol intake, and nutrient intake. Previous studies have demonstrated that alcohol intake and smoking are associated with metabolic syndrome risk (30). However, metabolic syndrome and its components have not been clarified to be related to nutrient intake and/or dietary patterns.  The Mediterranean diet and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)) are reported to prevent abdominal obesity (31).",3abed9ff-3289-4082-b569-de3a29215711
27,discussion3," Asians consume rice as a staple food and various foods as side dishes. Healthy diet patterns for Asians need to be specified, and thus, KEHI was modified to include items reflecting Korean balanced diet (KBD), which is associated with a lower metabolic syndrome risk (32). Korean balanced diet (KBD) is composed of mixed grains with fish, seaweeds, beans, vegetables, fermented foods, and fruits, and it can be applied in Asians. In the present study, the total scores of the MKhealthy eating index (HEI) were inversely related to abdominal obesity in both genders after adjusting for covariates. Moreover, the Korean balanced diet (KBD)-related MKhealthy eating index (HEI) scores were inversely associated with abdominal obesity in women after adjusting for covariates, whereas there was no significant association between Western style diet (WSD) and abdominal obesity. However, MKhealthy eating index (HEI) in Korean balanced diet (KBD) was not related to body mass index (BMI).",56ccdf7c-8cfc-4f57-9bef-3166cc935a52
28,discussion4," Therefore, although higher Korean balanced diet (KBD) intake indicated a lower risk of abdominal obesity, Korean balanced diet (KBD) was not related to body mass index (BMI) in the present study.  Given that dietary patterns do not represent a person's total food intake unless evaluated using cluster analysis, the MKhealthy eating index (HEI) for Korean balanced diet (KBD) included intakes of mixed grains, vegetables excluding kimchi and pickled vegetables, fermented vegetables kimchi and pickled vegetables, fish, beans including fermented beans, seaweeds and percentage of energy from polyunsaturated fatty acids. In the present study, MKhealthy eating index (HEI) for Korean balanced diet (KBD) was inversely associated with abdominal obesity risk in females with energy intake similar to estimated energy intake requirement (EER).",a907d74b-a6de-4b3b-a7f7-56b1ca847ef5
29,discussion5," Meanwhile, males had an energy intake of ~100 kcal/day above the estimated energy intake requirement (EER), and the MKhealthy eating index (HEI) for Korean balanced diet (KBD) was not significantly associated with abdominal obesity in males. Similarly, in cluster analysis of Korean balanced diet (KBD) participants with 11.6% higher energy intake based on estimated energy intake requirement (EER), adults with Korean balanced diet (KBD) did not have significantly lower waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) than those with Western style diet (WSD) and RMD (11). These results support that Korean balanced diet (KBD) is inversely associated with abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome when people consume energy within the estimated energy intake requirement (EER). The total energy intake and macronutrient intake did not influence abdominal obesity in the present study.",8f107a59-0ad4-4585-b784-370fc19e192b
30,discussion6,"  However, vitamin C intake was lower in the abdominal obesity group than in the control group in both genders, and these results were consistent with those in previous studies in different ethnicities and ages (33, 34). The difference in vitamin C is associated with a higher intake of fruit and fruit juice, including fruit juice, in both genders. Therefore, although ~10% of energy intake was higher than estimated energy intake requirement (EER) in the present study, abdominal obesity was mainly associated with fruit and vitamin C intake. Previous studies have consistently shown an inverse association between vitamin C intake, metabolic syndrome, and abdominal obesity (15, 35). Furthermore, serum vitamin C concentration is inversely associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome risk (36). Moreover, serum vitamin C concentrations are associated with obesity in both children and adults (36, 37).",67503b08-de95-45ef-be5e-921500147e60
31,discussion7," Lower vitamin C intake and serum vitamin C concentrations are associated with lower skeletal muscle mass in older males and females (38). In an animal study, vitamin C inhibited visceral obesity by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and increasing the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR))-α-dependent fatty acid β-oxidation genes in high-fat diets (39). Thus, vitamin C may be associated with increased fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, vitamin C may play a critical role in preventing abdominal obesity and the risk of metabolic syndrome in males and females.",2ff03192-abfd-48a9-a164-385d9f788d58
32,discussion8,"  The advantage of the present study is that, similar to the Mediterranean diet, high MKhealthy eating index (HEI) scores for Korean balanced diet (KBD) were shown to be inversely associated with abdominal obesity using a rolling sampling design that involves a complex, stratified, multistage probability cluster survey designed to represent the adult population. It supports that Korean balanced diet (KBD) should be recommended for preventing abdominal obesity in Asians. However, there are also some limitations to the present study. First, causal relations could not be determined as this was a cross-sectional study. Second, food intake scores in the MKhealthy eating index (HEI) were obtained from the semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire (SQFFQ) with 116 commonly consumed foods, and the intake of some foods may have been underestimated or overestimated.",05f56fbc-f387-4522-8617-20cb6eb96edb
33,discussion9," Third, nutrient intake estimated from a 24-h dietary recall might not reflect the usual intake because daily variation cannot be applied. Further studies are needed to determine the direct relationship between Korean balanced diet (KBD) and abdominal obesity in a randomized clinical trial or Mendelian randomization study.  Conclusion  In men, daily energy intake was the only factor to influence abdominal obesity determined by waist circumference, but any MKhealthy eating index (HEI) score was associated with abdominal obesity risk. However, in women, several MKhealthy eating index (HEI) scores in addition to daily energy intake influence abdominal obesity. Among the individual items of MKhealthy eating index (HEI), scores for fruit intake, including fruit juice, beans, and fermented beans, vitamin C and Na intake are inversely associated with abdominal obesity only in women.",a700d892-faeb-4221-a72c-e494f11de040
34,discussion10," Moreover, MKhealthy eating index (HEI) scores for Korean balanced diet (KBD) were inversely associated with abdominal obesity only in females. These findings support that the adherence to Korean healthy eating patterns reflecting Korean balanced diet (KBD), particularly adequate fruit and vitamin C intake, have the potential to protect against abdominal obesity risk in women.
