0,methods0," The present cross-sectional study conducted in Tabriz, Iran. This study recruited apparently healthy obese people. Accordingly, 288 eligible patients who met the following inclusion criteria enrolled to study: adults aged 20–50 years old, BMI > 30 kg/m2. In contrast, patients with history of chronic diseases such as kidney disorders, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, lactation and alcohol abuse were excluded and finally 147 men and 141 women completed the study. Patients who were eager to participate in the study were asked to respond the questions related to demographic characteristics as well as socio-economic status (socio economic status (SES)). The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (Ethics number: IR.TBZMED.REC.1397.266).  Anthropometric measurements performed by a highly skilled person including: height, weight and waist circumference (WC).",33d8d0d3-80f0-40a2-96bb-d673aa281bb6
1,methods1," Weight assessments was done in accordance to standards with a light clothes by an electronic balance (Seca, Germany) nearest to 100 g. Height measurements was conducted without shoes using a stadiometer with the accuracy of 0.1 cm. Waist circumference (WC) was measured at the point between the last rib and the iliac crest using a non-stretchable tape to the nearest 0.5 cm [20]. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were assessed in a relaxing position and body composition was measured by body composition analyzer BC-418-Tanita (United Kingdom).  Blood sample (10 cc) was obtained from all patients after overnight fasting. Then they were centrifuged at 4 °C, 3000 rpm for 10 min and stored at − 80 °C. Total cholesterol (TC), fasting serum glucose, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) measured by commercial kit (Pars Azmoon, commercial kit, Tehran, Iran). Also we calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) using Friedewald equation [21].",22b1b280-b4ff-4988-ac32-f87e49bb936a
2,methods2," Serum insulin level was measured by similar ELIZA kit. Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI)) values were computed too [22]. In addition, plasma α-MSH and AgRP were detected using commercially enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) kits (Bioassay Technology Laboratory, Shanghai Korean Biotech, Shanghai City, China) based on manufacture’s protocol. The minimum level of detection for α-MSH and AgRP levels were 5.07 ng/L and 1.03 pg/ml, respectively.  Habitual dietary intake of individuals over the preceding years was evaluated using a validated 132-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) [23, 24]. Participants were asked to report their usual consumption frequency and amounts of foods based on daily, weekly, monthly and yearly.",ffb7b42a-cafe-47e6-b03b-2b4f7d1ebdc3
3,methods3," Finally, the reported frequency for each food item was computed as a daily intake. Portion sizes of the daily intakes were converted to grams per day using household measurements and nutrient intake calculated using Iranian food composition table (food composition table (FCT)) [25]. In dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern, consumption of some components are encouraged to be increased and some suggested to be minimized. It is constructed of 8 components emphasizing on high intakes of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains and low-fat dairy products while diminished intakes of red and processed meats, sweetened beverages and sodium. According to intake ranking, each component classified into quintiles and zero points was awarded to emphasized components to high intake and a score of 5 for low recommended ones. Finally, the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet score can be measured from total score obtained [26].",af1b0ef3-5785-4e51-9978-dd33a90388b1
4,methods4," Also, we aimed to evaluate Mediterranean diet score (MDS) as an indicator of adherence to Mediterranean diet which, was constructed by Trichopoulou et al. in the present study [27]. It focuses on 9 components including: legumes, vegetables, cereals, fruits and nuts, meats, fish, dairy products, alcohol and the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acid (monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)) to saturated fatty acid (saturated fatty acid (SFA)). Mediterranean diet score (MDS) considers 0 or 1 score for each component with respect to sex-specific median as the cutoff. In that case, for person whose consumption of beneficial components (vegetables, legumes, fruits, cereal, nuts and fish) was below the median awarded 0 and equal or above the median assigned 1.",2d2373b1-bb17-4f47-ba2a-a6f6871a5215
5,methods5," In contrast, for components with deleterious properties such as: meat, poultry, and dairy products, which are rarely nonfat or low-fat in Greece, a value of 1 was assigned for consumption below the median and 0 for those consumption was at or above the median [27]. In accordance to sum of all components score, Mediterranean diet score (MDS) score will range from 0 (low adherence) to 9 (high adherence) finally [27].  DNA extraction procedures conducted to all blood samples. The Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART)PT rs2239670 SNP was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) technique. PCR was performed as follow: denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C, and extension for 20 s at 72 °C, for 35 cycles. The forward and backward primers were 5′-CCTGCTGCTGATGCTACCTCT-3′ and 5′-GCGCTTCGATCTGCAACACAC-3′, respectively.",91bfa8d3-2c75-4af7-941a-f0d780a161c8
6,methods6," Three genotypes were detected: homozygous AA (552 bp), heterozygous AG (212, 340 and 552 bp) and homozygous GG (340 and 212 bp) (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1: Fig. S1).Fig. 1 Genotyping of Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) rs2239670 variant by Apa-I PCR–RFLP analysis. M: 50 bp DNA ladder  Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, Version 22. We used Mean ± SD representing normally distributed continuous variables and the median (25th and 75th percentile) for not normally distributed continuous variables. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were used for reporting general characteristics of participants across Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART)PT genotypes. The interaction between dietary indices and Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) gene variants identified by ANCOVA multivariate model with adjustment to confounders. P-values < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. ",0a2bef76-2a42-43cb-bad8-f4135ebb481f
7,results0," This cross sectional study recruited 288 apparently healthy obese individuals including 51% men and 49% women. General characteristics and biochemical parameters of study participants across Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART)PT rs2239670 genotypes are presented in Table 1. In comparison of biochemical parameters, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) value showed a significant difference according to genotypes in female group (P = 0.01), which shows a high level of quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) in heterozygous genotype in comparison to other genotypes. This association remained significant even after adjustment for potential confounders. Due to gene-diet interaction analysis, serum fasting glucose levels may be affected by Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART)PT-dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) interaction (Pinteraction = 0.049) among men (Fig. 2).",51ce2956-ee09-421b-9d57-86d898ba69de
8,results1," Accordingly, high adherence to dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score in men contribute to decreasing serum fasting glucose level in third tertile of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score in comparison to those in second tertile. Additionally, men with AA genotypes have the highest level of serum fasting glucose level in the second tertile of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score adherence. Also, Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART)PT-Mediterranean diet score (MDS) interaction effects can be shown on insulin level (Pinteraction = 0.003), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (Pinteraction = 0.001) and HOMA-IR (Pinteraction = 0.003) among women (Fig. 3).",cc3027fa-aa10-4bdf-9ab0-b0430304a36e
9,results2," Despite of high adherence to Mediterranean diet score (MDS) in AA homozygous genotype an increasing level of insulin and HOMA-IR was shown among female group; likewise the highest insulin and HOMA-IR levels appeared in the last tertile of Mediterranean diet score (MDS) score. While AG genotype somehow could attenuate this effect and the lowest level of insulin and HOMA-IR was shown in high adherence to Mediterranean diet score (MDS). In contrast, females with homozygous genotype for A allele had the lowest mean of quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) in high adherence to Mediterranean diet score (MDS), and in relation to quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) value, females who were assigned to third tertile of Mediterranean diet score (MDS) showed the highest level of quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI).",ae5fcacf-20a6-43f0-92be-6bee9dde3302

11,discussion0," To the best of authors' knowledge, the current study discusses about the interactions between Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART)PT rs2239670 and dietary indices including dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score and Mediterranean diet score (MDS) in relation to metabolic risk factors for the first time. The genotype and allele distribution in this study, is similar to the studies conducted in Korea [28] and Malaysia [13]. Indeed, different demographic features and dietary patterns may explain this discrepancies. In accordance to our results, there was no significant differences between genotypes in relation to SBP and DBP and anthropometric parameters (WC, WHR and BMI) in Yeo study’s [13].",2ade591b-9090-4dbc-951b-fb351428becb
12,discussion1," Previous study conducted in Japanese population, showed an association between obesity and polymorphism of Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART)PT gene in the promoter region [29], while another variant in the 3’-UTR, C1442G (rs1800926) was not associated with obesity in Pima Indians [30]. Moreover, Guérardel A. designed a study to evaluate the effect of Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) gene polymorphisms and its association with obesity related traits in Caucasian population, which represented an association between SNP-3608T>C (rs7379701) and obesity [31]. Furthermore, no association was reported about lipid profile and Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) SNP like our study [31].",1ba17b2e-dd9b-42af-a9dc-ac07fd5a527a
13,discussion2,"  As one of the most outstanding findings of the present study, we can mention the significant interactions of Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART)PT rs2239670 with dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score on fasting serum glucose level among males even after adjusting for potential confounders. dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern tended to improve hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetic patients [32], which are in agreement with our results that subjects assigned to third tertile of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score represented lower level of glucose in comparison to second tertile. Also we documented an interesting significant interaction between Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART)PT rs2239670 and Mediterranean diet score (MDS) in term of insulin, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) and HOMA-IR levels in women.",126c7a3a-e7c8-4fe2-bc20-72ac23acd2e8
14,discussion3," The present study attempted to clarify the effects of dietary factors as a modulator, which can modify the association of Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART)PT gene polymorphism and cardio-metabolic risk factors, therefore, it can affects the genetic susceptibility to a variety of chronic diseases such as obesity. AA-carriers had the highest level of insulin and HOMA-IR, in spite of high adherence to Mediterranean diet score (MDS). In contrast, increased adherence to Mediterranean diet score (MDS) could well demonstrate its beneficial effects in decreasing insulin and HOMA-IR levels in AG carriers, which indicates the modifying effects of G allele attenuating genetic predisposition to metabolic risk factors. It is the result of individual variability in changing the ease and extent of alteration in metabolic risk factors. Whereas, Abiemo reported that high consistency with Mediterranean diet score (MDS) is associated with low insulin level in non-diabetic subjects [33].",0ffe539e-b5dc-4518-89d9-2c4862dfc68f
15,discussion4," In line with the present study, normo-glycemic and diabetic patients revealed lower levels of insulin and HOMA-IR in the upper tertile of Mediterranean diet score (MDS) compared to lower tertiles of diet score in Panagiotakos et al.’s study [34].  In general, the present study revealed that having AA genotype makes subjects more prone to have increased levels of insulin and HOMA-IR even in high accordance to Mediterranean diet score (MDS). Indeed, this genotype makes subjects more vulnerable to cardio-metabolic risk factors.  Limitations  Each study has its own limitations. First, cross sectional design doesn’t provide a platform to investigate cause and effect relationships. Second, it seems that underestimation in the report of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) may affect the results. Third, according to individual’s variability, it is better to be repeated in other population.  Supplementary Information  Additional file 1: Fig. S1.",449307e6-f476-471b-a5e1-20ef9aa9ab49
