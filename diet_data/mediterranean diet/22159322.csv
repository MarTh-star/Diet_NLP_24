0,introduction0,"For a long time, the focus of nutritional research was on nutrients. However, interactions and correlations among nutrients will influence their bioavailability and absorption. [1], [2] Therefore, investigating the relation of single nutrients with cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular diseases (CVD)) is not sufficient, and also individual foods and food patterns need to be studied in relation to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) incidence.  The traditional Mediterranean diet is a prototype of a healthy diet and is associated with a low risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). [3] Key features of a traditional Mediterranean diet are the use of olive oil as the principle component of fat; relatively high consumption of fruit, vegetables, fish, whole grains, legumes, and nuts; low consumption of meat and dairy; and moderate alcohol consumption with meals [4], [5].",86cf6983-6a47-4387-aed0-ecd5a4e7364b
1,introduction1,"  Controlled trials showed that a Mediterranean style diet was associated with favorable changes in body weight, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, which may all affect cardiovascular diseases (CVD) incidence [6]. In a secondary prevention trial in myocardial infarction patients, a Mediterranean style diet enriched with alpha-linolenic acid was associated with a 73% lower risk of cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarction compared with a prudent diet [7], [8]. Also, in a cohort study on the Mediterranean diet and survival among Greek cardiac patients, a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was strongly inversely associated with cardiac death [9].  A recent meta-analysis showed that each two unit increment in the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was associated with a 10% lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).",ddc45a94-becb-422e-a0a5-0905a28c1cee
2,introduction2," [10] The meta-analysis combined studies with different fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular diseases (CVD) enpoints. [10] The recently published prospective cohort study by Gardener et al. observed an association of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with fatal cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but not with incident myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. [11] These results suggest that a Mediterranean style diet may affect the risk of specific cardiovascular diseases (CVD) differently. Gardener et al. concluded that studies on Mediterranean style diets in relation to specific cardiovascular diseases (CVD) endpoints are needed. [11] Associations of Mediterranean style diets with angina pectoris, transient ischemic attack, peripheral arterial disease, or pulmonary embolism have not yet been investigated.",aa6a12ac-3f1d-4baa-8a92-7f81e5044a52
3,introduction3,"  The purpose of the present study was to investigate a Mediterranean style diet, as a prototype of a healthy diet, in association with incident fatal cardiovascular diseases (CVD), total cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and with specific cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The secondary aim was to explore which of the components of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) contributed most to these associations by assessing the effect of alternately excluding components of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS).

Baseline data of the 40,011 participants were collected between 1993 and 1997. The Monitoring Project on Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases (MORGEN) cohort consists of 22,654 men and women aged 20–65 years who were recruited through random population sampling in three Dutch towns (Amsterdam, Maastricht and Doetinchem). [12] The PROSPECT cohort included 17,357 women aged 50–70 years, who participated in a breast cancer screening program in the province of Utrecht.",773c031f-6329-49c0-bbbe-213d05ad92f7

6,methods2,"  Mediterranean Style Diet Dietary intake was assessed by a validated [13], [14] food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) which contained questions on the habitual frequency of consumption of 178 food items during the year preceding enrollment. Additional information was obtained on consumption frequency for different sub-items, and preparation methods. Colored photographs were used to estimate portion sizes of 28 food items. [13], [14] Reproducibility and validity were assessed in 121 men and women. [13], [14] Median twelve-month reproducibility of 16 food groups was 0.71 for men and 0.77 for women, ranging from resp. 0.45 and 0.63 for fish to 0.83 and 0.92 for alcoholic beverages. [13] The median validity of these 16 food groups, with 12 monthly 24-hour recalls as reference, was 0.61 for men and 0.53 for women, ranging from 0.32 for fish in men and 0.31 for vegetables in women to 0.74 (men) and 0.87 (women) for alcoholic beverages [13].",b815afa4-6cab-4b3c-afb4-25698eb365cb
7,methods3,"  We operationalized the concept of a healthy diet with the modified Mediterranean Diet Score (Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) defined by Trichopoulou et al. [5] For the composition of this score, values of 0 or 1 were assigned to each nutritional component using the sex-specific medians as cut-off values. For vegetables, fruits, legumes and nuts combined, grains, fish and seafood combined, and the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, intakes equal to or above the median were assigned a value of 1, and for intakes below that median a value of 0. For meat and for dairy products the scoring was inverted. We dichotomized alcohol consumption into non-users and users, because of the relatively low levels of alcohol consumption in this population. We did not define an upper limit for alcohol consumption, due to the low levels of alcohol consumption in the present population, and called the alcohol consumption of our population moderate.",414db4fe-00b1-48fc-9269-d3a4fa664953

The modified Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) could take a value from 0 (minimal adherence) to 9 (maximal adherence) [5] and associations with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were assessed in categories 0–2, 3–4, 5–6 and 7–9 and by two unit increment.  Ascertainment of Fatal and Nonfatal cardiovascular diseases (CVD) Events Participants were followed to the first nonfatal cardiovascular event, death, emigration, or were censored at January 1st 2008. Morbidity data were provided by the National Medical Registry (National Medical Registry (NMR)) using the Dutch Hospital Discharge data. Eighty-eight percent of the hospital admissions could uniquely be linked to an individual on the basis of sex, date of birth, and postal code.",7303f887-9637-45a6-9b9a-abf594ec6bda
9,methods5," [15] In a validation study conducted in a subsample of this population, the Hospital Discharge data was compared with that of a detailed clinical registry. [16] A sensitivity of 84% was observed for acute myocardial infarction hospital admissions. [16] We obtained vital status through linkage with municipal population registries. Subsequently, primary (underlying) and secondary causes of death were obtained through linkage with data from ‘Statistics Netherlands’. [12] In a study in which causes of death were coded again two years after initial coding, agreement ranged from 77–89% for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [17].  Incidence was defined as both fatal and nonfatal events unless otherwise specified. For fatal and nonfatal incidence combined, only first events were taken into account. For instance, when a person experienced a myocardial infarction followed by a pulmonary embolism, this person was censored after the myocardial infarction.",06cdc808-77ee-48a3-b915-611b94e0f085
10,methods6," For fatal cardiovascular diseases (CVD), no exclusions were made due to previous nonfatal events during follow-up. Total cardiovascular diseases (CVD) was coded as ICD9 [18] codes 390–459 and 798.

The remaining cardiovascular diseases (CVD) codes were coded as other cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Composite cardiovascular diseases (CVD) consisted of fatal cardiovascular diseases (CVD), plus nonfatal first myocardial infarction and stroke. Causes of death after 1996 were coded according to the corresponding ICD10 [19] codes.

Physical activity was assessed using the validated [20] European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) questionnaire and dichotomized according to the Cambridge Physical Activity Index (Cambridge Physical Activity Index (CPAI)) into (moderately) active and (moderately) inactive. [21] In the first year of the Monitoring Project on Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases (MORGEN) study (1993, 14.2% of the study population), physical activity was not assessed with the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) questionnaire.

Participants’ characteristics were calculated by sex and cohort as means (standard deviation) or medians (inter-quartile range) for continuous variables, and as percentages for categorical variables. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The proportional hazard assumption was fulfilled according to the graphical approach and according to Schoenfeld residuals. Two consecutive models were used to assess the associations between the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and the cardiovascular diseases (CVD) endpoints. The first model was adjusted for age, sex and cohort. The second model was additionally adjusted for smoking, physical activity, total energy intake, and educational level.",f13bbb51-4dcf-4233-bdbc-55ad53e9adee
13,methods9," We did not include BMI, blood pressure or serum cholesterol in our analyses, since we consider these intermediates in the association between a Mediterranean style diet and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). By adding interaction terms to the models, we assessed interaction on a multiplicative scale for age, sex, and cohort in the association between the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and the different cardiovascular endpoints. We also explored which of the components of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) contributed most to the associations for those cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that were related to the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) at p<0.10. For this, we alternately excluded one component of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) while adjusting for the excluded component. This reduced the ten point score (0–9) to a nine point score (0–8).",b0786ca6-af01-459c-b2bf-c8315c5120fe

21,discussion1," Comparison of our results with those of other investigations is hampered by differences in definition of Mediterranean style diet and of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) endpoints. In previous studies, the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) varied in definition of the components. Also, adherence to a Mediterranean style diet was categorized in various ways, ranging from two, to five categories of adherence. [10] The definition of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) also varied among studies, with various combinations of ICD codes and inclusion of fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular diseases (CVD) events. Taken together, results of previous studies showed that high compared to low adherence to a Mediterranean style diet was associated with a 20 [24] to 40% [25], [26] lower incidence of fatal cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and a 20 [25] to 25% [11] lower incidence of composite cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

22,discussion2,"  The association of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with fatal cardiovascular diseases (CVD) was stronger than with total cardiovascular diseases (CVD). A stronger association with fatal cardiovascular diseases (CVD) may be due to the probabilistic linkage of the non-fatal Hospital Discharge data causing more misclassification than for fatal events. This may have resulted in weaker associations for nonfatal cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Furthermore, our results showed that adding ‘softer’ endpoints such as transient ischemic attack, angina pectoris and peripheral arterial disease to the composite of ‘hard’ endpoints reduced the strength of the associations considerably. Therefore, in discussing the strength of associations with different cardiovascular diseases (CVD) endpoints, the definition of the latter is of utmost importance.",0fdc1469-c682-4658-90b5-64dc69895dc8
23,discussion3,"  For the highest compared to the lowest Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) category we observed a 30% lower incidence of myocardial infarction and for each two unit increment a 14% lower incidence. This was in line with a recent cohort study in 2568 men and women in the United States by Gardener et al. who observed a 39% lower incidence of myocardial infarction for the highest compared to the lowest Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) category, and for each 1 unit increment a 6% lower incidence, though these associations were non-significant due to the small sample size. [11] Our results are also consistent with those observed in other cohort studies, in which high compared to low adherence to a Mediterranean style diet was associated with a 30–40% lower incidence of coronary heart disease [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], although coronary hart disease incidence was defined differently in the various studies.",7f925a11-92ad-48ef-a805-45dec08c6d68

They observed a 13% lower incidence of stroke for those in the highest compared to the lowest quintile of adherence to a Mediterranean style diet. [25] The results of the cohort studies published so far, including ours (results not shown), showed similar results for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke [11], [25].  We observed that the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was inversely associated with the incidence of pulmonary embolism. This association was stronger for men than for women. Diet is hypothesized to affect venous thromboembolism, and thereby pulmonary embolism, by altering levels of haemostatic and fibrinolytic factors.",188411eb-098c-4961-a708-d13ab9e33c6c
25,discussion5," [30] To our knowledge other studies did not investigate diet in relation to pulmonary embolism before. However, we could compare our results with those of three large cohort studies investigating the relation of diet with venous thromboembolism. The results of these studies were inconsistent. [31], [32], [33] Therefore, our results for pulmonary embolism need confirmation by other prospective cohort studies.  In the present study, the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was not statistically significantly related to incident angina pectoris, transient ischemic attack and peripheral arterial disease. To our knowledge these associations have not been investigated earlier. These three diseases are ‘softer’ endpoints than e.g. myocardial infarction and stroke. This may have resulted in more misclassification [16] which may have diluted the associations of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with these endpoints.",7b94b5a2-baa9-4dea-9a8d-dbd80b91e575

No previous study on the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in relation to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) assessed the effect of alternately excluding components of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS).

We studied the adherence to a Mediterranean style diet in a Dutch population. The Dutch diet is characterized by a low consumption of plant foods and fish and by a high consumption of animal foods compared to the traditional Mediterranean diet. [34] However, similar associations of a Mediterranean style diet with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were observed in Mediterranean, Northern European and in American populations. [10] This implies that, at different levels of adherence, a Mediterranean style diet is beneficial in relation to cardiovascular health.",9a8ab45b-637a-4189-a099-3fc3d959ba3d
28,discussion8," Furthermore, our associations were robust since in sensitivity analyses, including only whole grain cereals in the component ‘cereals’, or only moderate to high fat meat products and dairy products in the components ‘meat products’ and ‘dairy products’, hardly changed the results (results not shown). Also additionally adjusting the components of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) for energy intake (density method) or exclusion of cases in the first two years of follow-up hardly changed our results (results not shown).  Some limitations of our study need to be addressed. Dietary intake was self-reported using a validated food-frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)). This questionnaire had a good reproducibility, although the validity of vegetable (Spearman correlation coefficients: 0.38 for men and 0.31 for women) and fish (0.32 for men and 0.37 for women) consumption is of concern.",0de5270a-45f3-411f-b1f6-0f038af4f3f5
29,discussion9," [13], [14] In addition, diet was assessed only once and may have changed during follow-up, resulting in non-differential misclassification that may have attenuated the observed associations. Furthermore, our study is a prospective cohort study in which adherence to Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was not randomized. Therefore, residual confounding cannot be ruled out. With regard to the cardiocascular follow-up, ‘hard’ endpoints, like myocardial infarction or stroke, are easier to diagnose than ‘softer’ endpoints like angina pectoris, transient ischemic attack or peripheral arterial disease. Also, ‘hard’ endpoints are more likely to be treated in the hospital than ‘softer’ ones, and thus monitored in the Hospital Discharge Registries [16]. In a validation study comparing the Hospital Discharge data to that of a cardiology information system, sensitivity was considerably larger for acute myocardial infarction (84%) than for unstable angina pectoris (53%) [16].",1730763d-a329-4ba1-9f18-f356a8351e4f
30,discussion10," Therefore, misclassification is likely smaller for the ‘hard’ events, which may have resulted in stronger associations.  The present study also has advantages. European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-NL is a large prospective cohort study, especially designed to study associations between diet and chronic diseases, and included both men and women from the general population, with a broad age range and a long follow-up period. Because of the detailed cardiovascular follow-up data and the large sample size, we were able to investigate associations of a Mediterranean style diet with specific cardiovascular diseases (CVD).  In conclusion, the present study showed that better adherence to a Mediterranean style diet was more strongly associated with fatal cardiovascular diseases (CVD) than with total cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Disease specific associations were strongest for incident myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism.",e41a8173-c742-462c-adcd-5b9a8678413d
