0,methods0,"2.1. Study Design and Participants This cross-sectional study evaluated the relationship between diet quality measured using three metrics (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015, aMed and the Dietary Screening Tool (Dietary Screening Tool (DST))) and relative leukocyte telomere length (rLTL) in a non-smoking middle-aged population in West Virginia. Participants were 45- to 64-year-old adults recruited from two counties by word-of-mouth and community advertising. Exclusion criteria included current smokers; diagnosis of cancer, kidney, heart or liver disease; surgery 6 months prior; anti-inflammatory or anti-coagulant medications; major diet/appetite change 3 months prior or abuse of alcohol or other substances. The study protocol (#1507753607) was approved by West Virginia University’s Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided informed consent. Participants were given a $100 gift card for participation.  2.2.",053f1f5a-389f-4dc0-b4f2-ea5c92dc6f52
1,methods1," Diet Quality and Nutrition Risk Assessment Dietary intake was assessed using three 24-h recalls collected and analyzed using Nutrition Data Systems for Research (Nutrition Data Systems for Research (NDSR)) software version 15 (2015) developed by the Nutrition Coordinating Center (Nutrition Coordinating Center (NCC)), University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA. Interviews were conducted over the telephone by Nutrition Coordinating Center (NCC)- trained research personnel using the software’s integrated multiple-pass method on two weekdays and one weekend day. Diet quality was assessed using two diet quality index scores, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 and the aMed index score, in addition to a nutrition risk screener, the Dietary Screening Tool (DST).",92ceadcb-fa12-45e7-95c7-b4ec2f6d5d54
2,methods2,"  To obtain Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 index scores, Nutrition Data Systems for Research (NDSR) food and nutrient output files were first transformed into Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 component variables using Nutrition Data Systems for Research (NDSR)’s unpublished guide [24]. Then, the simple Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scoring algorithm method for multiple days of intake data was applied [25]. A score was calculated for 13 diet variables: nine adequacy components (total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, greens and beans, whole grains, dairy, total protein foods, seafood and plant protein, and fatty acids) and four moderate components (refined grains, sodium, added sugars and saturated fats) using a density approach [26]. The 13 component scores were summed for a total Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score ranging from 0–100, with higher scores indicating better adherence to the 2015 DGAs.",02b7c167-f177-4e43-beee-a80f309e8489
3,methods3,"  The aMed diet score, created based on intake patterns associated with the risk of chronic disease, was used to assess adherence to a Mediterranean style diet [27]. The Nutrition Data Systems for Research (NDSR) output was used to determine intake values for each of the nine variables making up the index: eight desirable components (whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, fish, the ratio of MUFAs to PUFAs, and alcohol), and one undesirable component (processed and red meat products). The component values were energy adjusted using a density approach and the intakes were compared to the sex-specific median from our sample population. Scores above the median for desirable components, and below the median for the undesirable component, were assigned 1 point; otherwise 0 points were assigned [28]. The nine component scores were summed for a total aMed score ranging from 0–9 with higher scores indicating better adherence to the Mediterranean diet [27,28].",7a401eb7-dc98-4312-a474-8546d25a0100
4,methods4,"  Unlike the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 and aMed index scores which are based on intakes from multiple 24-h recalls, the Dietary Screening Tool (DST) is a survey instrument made up of 24 questions about food intake and behaviors and one question about dietary supplement use [29]. The screening instrument was previously validated in this sample to assess overall diet quality and to detect nutritional risk particularly as it relates to fruit and vegetable intake [30]. For this study, the questions were asked on the online survey and the scoring algorithm was applied based on participant responses. The scores were summed for a total Dietary Screening Tool (DST) score ranging from 0–105 points with higher scores indicating better overall diet quality. Participant scores were categorized as being “at nutrition risk” (Dietary Screening Tool (DST) scores < 60) or “not at risk/at potential risk” (Dietary Screening Tool (DST) scores ≥ 60) [30].  2.3.",827b053a-980d-4eef-80c9-32d184fecc24
5,methods5," Relative Leukocyte Telomere Length A fasting venous blood draw was performed by a trained phlebotomist at the in-person session. Blood was collected in vacutainers containing ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid (ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid (EDTA)). Whole blood was apportioned into 1 mL micro-centrifuge tubes and placed on dry ice for transport to West Virginia University where it was frozen at −80 °C until shipped for analysis. Genomic DNA from the whole blood was isolated from the de-identified and coded samples using a Zymo Research Quick-gDNA MiniPrep kit following the manufacture’s guidelines. rLTL was measured from the DNA by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) based on a published protocol with minor modifications [31]. Briefly, the rLTL was calculated as the ratio of the telomere repeat copy number to a single-copy control gene (T/S ratio).",58184677-1e14-4bd8-bd5d-dcd165d60e79
6,methods6," For each sample, the concentration of purified DNA was measured on a NanoDrop and diluted to 2 µg/mL in 96-well microtiter plate in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid (EDTA), and pH 7.5. Then, 4.0 ng of DNA was used in a qPCR reaction with a SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The concentration of the oligonucleotides used to amplify the telomere repeat was 270 nM for TelF (5′ GGT TTT TGA GGG TGA GGG TGA GGG TGA GGG TGA GGG T 3′) and 900 nM for TelR (5′ TCC CGA CTA TCC CTA TCC CTA TCC CTA TCC CTA TCC CTA 3′). The single copy gene, Eif2a was amplified using an oligonucleotide concentration at 200 nM each (E2aF 5′ ACC TAC TCC TGC CCC ACA GA 3′ and E2aR 5′ GTC CCC AGA AAT TGA CTG AGA GA 3′). In total, each set (Telomere and Eif2a) was run 4 separate times on 4 separate days. The average cycle time (Ct) for each was used to calculate the telomere to T/S ratio (T/S ratio = 2-Ct(Telomere)-Ct(Eif2a) or 2−ΔCt).",61c0bc66-fd66-4295-97a9-cd823bc29101
7,methods7," The relative T/S ratio was determined by dividing the T/S ratio of each participant by the average T/S ratio of all participants, and is expressed here as rLTL. Any samples that appeared as a potential outlier (>2 standard deviations from the mean) was repeated on a freshly prepared sample. The intra- assay percent coefficient of variation (% CV) were calculated for the quadruplicates. The average intra-assay % CV for the telomere ranged from 0.5–3.2% for all 96 participants and from 0.2–2.7% for the single copy gene for 95 participants. The one outlier had a% CV of 7.2% which was likely caused by a pipetting error in one of the 4 replicates creating a larger than average standard deviation. The inter-assay % CV was 1.8% for the telomere and 1.15% for the single copy gene. The correlation coefficient for telomere samples was between 0.84 and 0.93 in cross comparisons between the 4 replicates.  2.4.",66a34c5c-6dc9-48cc-8be8-0228ddbecb6d
8,methods8," Potential Confounding Variables Potential confounding sociodemographic, lifestyle and health-related variables were identified by the literature as being related to rLTL. The self-reported data were obtained via an online survey administered using the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) survey software [32] hosted at the West Virginia Clinical and Translation Science Institute. Anthropometric measures, blood pressure and blood for analyses were obtained at an in-person health assessment visit.  2.4.1. Sociodemographic and Lifestyle Factors Sociodemographic (age, sex, income level, and education) and lifestyle factors (alcohol use, smoking history, physical activity, and sleep) were assessed using self-reported survey responses. For analysis, alcohol intake was categorized as “non-drinker”, “1–2 drinks per week” and “≥3 drinks per week”. Smoking history was classified as “having ever smoked” or “never having had smoked”; all participants were nonsmokers at the time of the study.",90108b99-adec-4192-bf9a-f51f62ec6c82
9,methods9," Physical activity was estimated using the validated International Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) Short Form [33] and scoring protocol [34]. A total physical activity score (metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-minutes/week) was calculated. Activity was categorized as active, minimally active or inactive using the provided algorithm [34]. Sleep quality was evaluated using the validated 19-question Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) [35]. Component scores were summed to obtain a global sleep quality score ranging from 0–21 points with higher scores indicating overall poorer sleep quality [35]. Global scores ≤ 5 were classified as “good” and > 5 as “poor” sleep [35]. For both the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scoring, participant responses were excluded if any question was left blank or the answer was out-of-range [34,35].  2.4.2.",2c7758b9-8136-4ddb-aae4-c9e54836f911
10,methods10," Health-Related Factors Health-related factors included measures of adiposity, diagnoses of select health conditions, cardiovascular health (cardiovascular health (CVH)) as determined by Life’s Simple 7 (LS7) and select inflammatory markers. Adiposity was assessed using body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), waist circumference (WC) and fat mass index (fat mass index (FMI)). Anthropometric measures including height, weight, WC and body composition were taken at the in-person visit using standardized protocols with participants fasted, lightly clothed and without shoes. All measurements were recorded in duplicate and averages were used for analysis. Height (cm) was measured using the Seca 274 digital mobile stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Weight (kg) and fat mass index (FMI) (kg/m2) were obtained using the Seca medical Bioelectrical Composition Analyzer (mBCA) 514 and Seca analytics 115 PC software (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) [36].",2ea9d491-fd6e-4775-9e4f-40ef39ddda2a
11,methods11," WC was measured using a Gulick II tape measure at the iliac crest. Values >102 cm for men and >88 cm for women were categorized as “at risk” [37]. body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2) and classified using World Health Organization classifications [37].  Participants were classified as having a diagnosis of pre-diabetes or diabetes, hypertension or dyslipidemia if they self-reported having been diagnosed with the health condition, they reported taking a medication used to treat the condition on the in-person questionnaire, or their measured lab values met standard diagnostic criteria. Each person’s cardiovascular health (CVH) was assessed using the American Heart Association’s LS7 metric and scoring algorithm [38]. The LS7 metric assesses cardiovascular health (CVH) based on 7 components: blood pressure, total cholesterol, blood glucose, physical activity, diet, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status.",e37b5bd9-6ac5-4c74-a6dc-5c61d92b4859
12,methods12," Physical activity, diet information (except sodium intake), and smoking status were self-reported by participants. Sodium intake values were obtained from the 24-h recall data. Anthropometric measures for body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and blood for analysis of total cholesterol and fasting blood glucose were collected by research personnel and a trained phlebotomist at an in-person health assessment visit. Total cholesterol and fasting blood glucose were measured by West Virginia University Medicine Hospital Labs. Blood pressure was measured by research personnel using the Omron HEM-907XL Intellisense® Automatic Oscillatory Digital Blood Pressure automatic inflation sphygmomanometer (Omron Health Care, Lake Forest, IL, USA) using standard protocol. Each of the 7 factors was assigned a score of 0 (poor), 1 (intermediate) and 2 (ideal) based on AHA criteria [38].",9b1eb7ff-431f-439d-a0a3-6eb5739388b9
13,methods13," Individual scores were summed for a total score ranging from 0–14, with higher scores corresponding to less risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Total scores were categorized into a health risk group: poor (0–4), average (5–9), and optimum (10–14).  Three inflammatory markers associated with cardiovascular health were assessed: C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)), fibrinogen and TNF-α. Fibrinogen and C-reactive protein were measured by West Virginia University Medicine Hospital Labs. TNF-α levels were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)) using 100 µL of sera and the Human TNF-α Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit from Invitrogen (Product KHC3011) following the manufacture’s guidelines. The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)s were performed on 3 separated days and average values were calculated.  2.5.",41abf2e0-bd0f-4420-9c32-16f1cb4dd6f8
14,methods14," Statistical Analyses The initial screening of explanatory variables including the diet factors and covariates was completed on all subjects (n = 96), but focused on a subset of the data (50%) with the most extreme values of telomere length, namely, the first (Q1) and fourth (Q4) quartile (n = 24 in each). Primary bivariate analyses included t-test, Chi-square test and Fisher’s Exact tests. t-tests were used to confirm differences in the rLTL between Q1 and Q4. The relationship of individual categorical variables (sociodemographic, lifestyle, health and diet factors) with Q1 and Q4 rLTL quartiles were examined using Chi-square test or Fisher’s Exact test when necessary due to the sample size restrictions. A logistic regression (LR) was used to measure the strength of the relationship of individual continuous variables to Q1 and Q4 of rLTL.",ed6accff-3d74-4a72-bd54-2fa502c24fd1
15,methods15," The logit estimates of slope (β), standard error of the β (SE), as well as odds ratios with confidence limits and p-values corresponding to the slope estimates were reported for LR.  Continuous rLTL was used in a secondary set of analyses. All observations were included (n = 96) unless there were missing data or influential observations. Influence diagnostic tests were computed for the bivariate fit of continuous data using simple linear regression. Data point(s) which exceeded the criteria of student residual >2 (no more than 5 observations) were excluded in one round of screening. The relationship of each individual diet quality index scores as continuous variables and rLTL was first assessed by simple linear regression analysis (Model 1).",ab19f68c-2805-4e08-ad75-a242485f954e
16,methods16," Further, variables found significantly related to rLTL in the primary bivariate analyses (smoking, LS7, and income) together with the individual diet quality variables (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015, aMed and Dietary Screening Tool (DST)) were entered into multivariate models with an estimation method using residual maximum likelihood (residual maximum likelihood (REML)), utilizing PROC MIXED of SAS®. Physical activity, although significant in the bivariate analysis, was not used in the secondary models due to a large reduction in sample size as many participants did not respond to all of the questions (n = 31, 32%). The multivariate models enabled us to assess if the specific dietary patterns would be related to rLTL when adjusted for other significant characteristics, such as LS7 and smoking (Model 2), with further examination of the diet and smoking interaction (Model 3) and additional adjustments for income (Model 4).",d48e0fa4-5d57-437c-9c27-5882462e9f9b
17,methods17," The outcome of such an analysis included the F-value, determined from the ratio of explained and unexplained variability for the main effect and interaction, and the corresponding p-value in addition to specific parameter estimates, such as the slope (β), its standard error (SE), the t-value, a test-statistics for testing β = 0, and a corresponding p-value for each continuous variable and for c-1 categories for categorical variables. For smoking, the β for the effect of the “never smoked” group was estimated; for income, the <$50,000 and between $50,000 and $75,000 groups were estimated; for Dietary Screening Tool (DST), the categorical “at nutrition risk” group effect on rLTL was estimated, while the remaining last category in each variable could not be assessed due to the loss of degrees of freedom. The quality of each model was estimated by Akaike Information Criterion with a sample size correction (a sample size correction (AICC)) [39,40].",27cca6cb-8bf9-4842-aa43-e487d2c13343
18,methods18," The a sample size correction (AICC) approximates the quality of each model and is determined from a restricted maximum log-likelihood, the number of observations, and the number of parameters in the model; the smallest a sample size correction (AICC) represents an optimal model.

The significance criterion alpha for all tests was 0.05.  3. Results 3.1. Sociodemographic, Lifestyle and Health-related Characteristics Ninety-six participants took part in the study (57.3% women). Overall, participants were predominately white (97%), were college educated (57.3%) and had an annual household income of $50,000 or more (67%). On average, participants were 54.3 years old and had a body mass index (BMI) of 30.9 kg/m2 (SD = 7.2).",cade6050-289d-4c6c-b397-9ad348996e0a
19,methods19," Half of the participants (51%) were obese, and a large majority had dyslipidemia (91.7%) and an elevated waist circumference (72.9%). All participants had at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).  The rLTL values ranged from 0.46 to 1.49 (mean ± SD was 1.02 ± 0.18). Participant characteristics for the shortest and longest quartiles of rLTL are provided in Table 1. Of the sociodemographic variables, rLTL was only associated with income. Participants with a yearly income at or above $75,000 had significantly longer telomeres than participants with an annual income below $50,000. Of those in the highest rLTL quartile, 65.2% had incomes ≥$75,000 compared to 29.2% in the lowest quartile (p = 0.02).  Of the lifestyle factors, physical activity and smoking history, but not alcohol consumption and sleep, were related to rLTL. A significant relationship was found between rLTL and physical activity (p = 0.02) and smoking history (p = 0.01).",95a6ef0e-2257-4c2f-add0-2515ee463f5b
20,methods20," None of the participants were current smokers as this was an exclusion factor for study participation. However, half of participants had smoked in the past with a majority of previous smokers (72.9%) having quit more than 5 years prior to the study. Of those in the highest rLTL quartile, 83.3% had never smoked compared to 41.2% in the lowest quartile (p = 0.01).  Of the health-related factors, only cardiovascular health as measured by the LS7 on both a continuous and categorical scale was related to rLTL quartiles. About half (52.2%) were rated on the LS7 as having “average” cardiovascular health, 47.8% rated as “optimal” and none were identified as having “poor” cardiovascular health. Those in the highest rLTL quartile had higher total scores on the LS7 survey than those in the lowest quartile (9.22 ± 1.81 vs. 7.76 ± 1.73, p = 0.01). Of the participants in the highest quartile of rLTL, 52% had optimal cardiovascular health compared to only 19.",034e1a90-b348-4735-b4d0-48d6df2ac96a
21,methods21,"1% of participants in the lowest quartile (p = 0.02).  Overall, based on the quartiles analyses, the smoking history, cardiovascular health (LS7 scores), income, and physical activity differed significantly between the lowest and highest rLTL quartiles and thus were considered as potential confounding variables (Figure 1). However, physical activity was not included in further models as data was missing for nearly 1/3 of the sample (n = 31).  3.2. Diet Quality and Nutrition Risk Association of nutrition risk categories with rLTL quartiles (shortest and longest) were examined by Chi-square test. Relationship of continuous diet quality scores with rLTL quartiles (shortest and longest) were assessed by logistic regression and results of both analyses are listed in Table 2. A majority of participants (64.6%) were classified as “at nutrition risk” using the Dietary Screening Tool (DST) as a categorical measure. An association of nutrition risk and rLTL category was detected (p = 0.",55d54cb9-3aea-4475-b9e2-3f8bfbac8090
22,methods22,"02); a large proportion of participants with shorter rLTL were at nutrition risk (79.2%) while only 45.8% of those with the longest rLTL were at nutrition risk. Using LR, no effect of diet quality scores (aMed, Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015, and Dietary Screening Tool (DST) measured on the continuous scale) on the shortest and longest quartiles of rLTL were observed as demonstrated by odds ratios values close to one. That is, the odds of having higher rLTL (Q4) did not increase with a higher diet quality scores with respect to Q1.  Table 3 lists the associations between diet quality scores (aMed, Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015, and Dietary Screening Tool (DST)) and telomere length (continuous) examined individually (Model 1) or after adjustment for LS7 and smoking (Model 2), diet quality, and smoking interaction (Model 3) and with the addition of the income category (Model 4).",90c20091-71aa-40c6-9dc7-5f1f57a82bad
23,methods23," Categorical Dietary Screening Tool (DST) (<60 “at nutrition risk” and ≥60 “potential risk/ not at risk”) was found significantly associated with rLTL in the unadjusted model (Model 1). The least square mean (least square mean (LSM)) telomere length ± standard error (SE) was 0.98 ± 0.02 for the “at nutrition risk” group and 1.07 ± 0.03 for the “potential/no risk group”. In addition, the effect of the Dietary Screening Tool (DST) category on rLTL was observed in the model with an adjustment for smoking, LS7, and income (Model 4, p = 0.02). None of the continuous diet quality scores were related to rLTL when used in a simple model (Model 1) without any covariates. However, a trend approaching statistical significance (p = 0.07) was demonstrated in the overall F-value of aMed in Model 3, when the effect of aMed on rLTL was adjusted to smoking plus the interaction of aMed and smoking (not shown). Smoking history was significantly related to rLTL in many models tested (Table 3).",b6c14bad-6c88-4c10-9cf1-3c3a7bb42a45
24,methods24," Individuals who never smoked had a longer telomere, 1.08 (least square mean (LSM)) ± 0.02 (SE), compared to those who ever smoked, 0.98 (least square mean (LSM)) ± 0.02 (SE).  Graphical representation of significant relationship of rLTL with smoking history and nutrition risk category is in Figure 2. Participants who had never smoked had longer rLTL than those who smoked in their past across both categories of nutrition risk (main effect of Smoking, F-Value = 11.82, p = 0.0009). Likewise, participants who were at nutrition risk, regardless of smoking in the past, had lower rLTL (main effect of Dietary Screening Tool (DST), F-value = 8.95, p = 0.004). However, no significant interaction was detected. Figure 2 shows rLTL by smoking history and nutrition risk category.

25,methods25," Likewise, participants who were at nutrition risk, regardless of smoking in the past, had lower rLTL. However, no significant interaction was detected.  4. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the relationships between evidence-based dietary patterns and nutrition risk classifications with rLTL in a subpopulation at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this cross-sectional study of 96 middle-aged adults with at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), participants identified as being “at nutrition risk” (Dietary Screening Tool (DST) scores < 60) had shorter rLTL than those “not at risk/potential risk” (Dietary Screening Tool (DST) scores > 60). However, we did not detect associations between rLTL and any of the diet quality scores (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015, aMed, or Dietary Screening Tool (DST)) measured on a continuous scale.",539a7140-a073-4144-9e7c-7820831c7d89
26,methods26,"  The discrepancy between the results for Dietary Screening Tool (DST) categorical versus continuous data may be in the robust nature of categorical estimates (Chi-Square test) as opposed to the more refined nature of linear regression analysis. That is, the rate of change in rLTR due to one-point increase in Dietary Screening Tool (DST) 100-point scale may be negligible, while the logical grouping may elude to the threshold of nutritional quality and risk status. Nutrition risk was determined based on scores from the Dietary Screening Tool (DST). In the Dietary Screening Tool (DST) validation study, those classified “at nutrition risk” had lower intakes of several antioxidant nutrients, and lower serum levels of carotenoids than those “not at risk” [30].",af81c41f-b097-4a16-8a59-3ccd3125391f
27,methods27," Thus, a plausible mechanism for the relationship between Dietary Screening Tool (DST) risk categories and rLTL is that lower intakes of antioxidant nutrients result in higher oxidative stress levels [41], a major cause of DNA damage, which exacerbates telomere shortening [42]. Additionally, higher serum carotenoids have been associated with longer LTL [43,44].  We did not detect a relationship between either of the diet index scores and rLTL, however, we noticed a value approaching significance for the energy-adjusted aMed (p = 0.07) in a model with adjustment to smoking and aMed and smoking interaction. Several other studies have been conducted on a Mediterranean style diet and TL, but they use various diet indices and statistical models; thus, results are inconsistent. A study on older adults did not detect an association between diet and LTL [45], another found a significant correlation in whites only [46], and a few [13,20,47] found significant positive associations.",1ef78f13-a0c0-4fbe-ad73-99115d6b81f7
28,methods28," Unlike the other indices, the aMed diet index score is measured in relation to the median intake of the sample. The only other study to use this specific index found a significant relationship between diet and rLTL in middle-aged and older women [20]; however, they had a very large sample size and healthy subjects. A subsample of the PREDIMED trial of middle-aged and older adults at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), found that baseline adherence to a Mediterranean diet assessed using a 14-item tool was related to TL in women, but not men [48]. In our study, the mean aMed score was low in both the shortest and longest quartiles (3.63 ± 1.71 and 4.04 ± 2.16, respectively) representing an overall low to moderate adherence to Mediterranean-style diet. While no other studies were found that used the updated Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015, Leung et al.",2f87ab49-04f6-4457-8151-583dc4f1e18f
29,methods29," used the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 in a large population-based sample and found a significant difference in TL between the highest and lowest quintiles of diet quality in healthy women, but not men [20].  Our findings that rLTL correlated with smoking status, physical activity and income were consistent with the literature [49,50,51]. Interestingly, our population was made up of non-smokers, but having had smoked in the past was related to rLTL in most models. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that those who never smoked had longer telomeres than those who had ever smoked [52]. We did not detect a significant difference in rLTL based on sex, age, body mass index (BMI), or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Several studies indicate that women have longer TL than men; however, a systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that the difference was significant in studies that measured TL using Southern blot method, but not PCR as we did here [53].",67826648-24f2-4084-a563-83ed36321e44
30,methods30," We may not have detected a difference in age as other studies have because our population included only middle-aged adults. Most studies designed to assess the effects of chronological age on rLTL also include younger and older adults in the sample.  We did, however, detect a relationship between rLTL and LS7 scores which are made up of seven different cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. This supports the notion that the combined effect of multiple risk factors has a greater impact on rLTL than individual risk factors. This finding was confirmed by Gebreab et al. in a large population based study on the association between cardiovascular health (CVH) and LTL using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data [7]. Their findings showed that those with “ideal” cardiovascular health (CVH) as measured by LS7 had longer LTL than those with “intermediate” and “poor” cardiovascular health (CVH) [7].",0c74b5eb-dae4-4259-a94a-3b314804bb73
31,methods31," Thus, achieving the AHA’s ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) may slow LTL shortening rate, particularly in non-Hispanic whites. The components of LS7 are potentially modifiable, thus intervention studies are needed to determine if lifestyle improvements resulting in higher LS7 scores (i.e., better cardiovascular health) result in reduced telomere attrition over time, particularly in subpopulations at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).  The strengths of the present study include the collection of multiple 24-h dietary recalls by trained research personnel; a detailed lifestyle assessment using validated survey instruments; and objective measures of blood pressure, anthropometrics and laboratory values. There are some limitations to note. First, we had a small sample size composed predominantly of non-Hispanic whites. Therefore, our findings may not be generalized to other populations or ethnicities.",991f6bec-2546-42c8-8c83-4783ffeac039
32,methods32," Secondly, the diet, lifestyle and health assessments were all based on self-reported data which is prone to recall and other biases, despite being validated measurement tools that are routinely used to assess lifestyle factors [54]. Thirdly, the LTL was analyzed using DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)) [31] and this may not necessarily reflect TL in other cells and tissue throughout the body. However, the measures generally correlate across tissues within the same individual [13]. Lastly, the cross-sectional design implies association rather than causal relationships limiting the clinical interpretations of the findings. Longitudinal and interventional studies that measure rLTL over time are needed to better understand the relationship of diet to rLTL.  5.",bac58e55-2c69-41c2-93d9-1288ae30e50e
33,methods33," Conclusions We found evidence that individuals with a higher quality diet as assessed by the Dietary Screening Tool (DST) had longer telomeres than those with lower quality diets. Participants identified as being “at nutrition risk” by the Dietary Screening Tool (DST) had shorter rLTL than those “not at risk/potential risk”. However, adherence to the DGAs or a Mediterranean diet was not associated with rLTL in unadjusted models or models adjusted for confounding variables. Intervention studies are needed to determine if improving diet quality of those at nutrition risk result in telomere attrition or lengthening over time. ",162bde5f-b949-4313-80f7-19c0535e9cb6
