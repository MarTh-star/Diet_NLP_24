0,methods0,"2.1. Cell Culture and Treatments The mouse neuro-2a (N2a) neuroblastoma cell line (Ref: CCL-131, American Type Culture Collection (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)), Manassas, VA, USA) was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Lonza, Amboise, France) containing 10% (v/v) of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum (FBS)) (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) (30 min, 56 °C) and 1% (v/v) of penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 mg/mL) (Pan Biotech). The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air) and passaged twice a week. The cells were seeded for the different experimental conditions, at a density of 1.",88dc0c0b-daf7-4e85-8a06-cbb685523142
1,methods1,"2 × 105 cells per well containing 1 mL of culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 6-well plates (FALCON, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) or in Petri dishes at 30,000 cells/cm2 (100 mm diameter) in order to assess the ability of trans-resveratrol (resveratrol (RSV)), quercetin (QCT) and apigenin (apigenin (API)) to counteract the cytotoxicity induced by 7-ketocholesterol (7KC). 7KC (ref: C2394; purity >90%), resveratrol (RSV) (trans-resveratrol, ref: 501-36-0; purity 99%) and QCT (ref: #Q0125; purity >98%) were from (Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin-Fallavier, France); apigenin (API) was from (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France; ref: #52262; purity >97%). The stock solution of 7KC was prepared at 800 µg/mL (2 mM) as previously described [68].",0422141b-aa60-47d5-bdc2-229a7b8f8566
2,methods2," The stock solutions of polyphenols were prepared as follows: resveratrol (RSV) at 50 mM in absolute ethanol (EtOH; Carlo Erba Reagents, Val de Reuil, France), whereas dimethyl sulfoxide (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); Sigma-Aldrich) was used as vehicle to dissolve QCT and apigenin (API) prepared at 50 mM. Alpha-tocopherol (Sigma-Aldrich, ref: T3251; purity >96%) was used as a positive control for cytoprotection since its cytoprotective effects have been shown on several cell lines [30,33]. By using α-tocopherol as the reference cytoprotective molecule, it not only makes it possible to evaluate the cytoprotection of polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), QCT, apigenin (API)) in relation to α-tocopherol, but also to estimate their cytoprotective activities in relation to molecules considered cytoprotective and previously compared with α-tocopherol.",cacb4682-9842-4cd7-a0fe-76ecf9e6aeac
3,methods3," After 24 h of cell culture, the culture medium was removed; polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API)) used at various concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 25 µM, or α-tocopherol (400 μM), were introduced in the culture medium without or with 7KC (50 µM), and the cells were incubated for 48 h. The choice of the concentration of 7KC was based on the viability tests performed in this study which show that 50 µM is the 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) in N2a cells. Alpha-tocopherol was used at the highest non-cytotoxic concentration (400 µM) able to prevent 7KC-induced apoptosis [69]. In addition, to clarify the ability of resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) to prevent 7KC-induced cell death, N2a cells were also pre- and post-treated with polyphenols (1.5 to 25 µM) added 2 h before or 2 h after 7KC, respectively.",9f2e78d4-c260-42d5-9518-1954021fd3b9
4,methods4,"  The cytoprotective activities of resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) against 7KC-induced cell death were also evaluated in co-treatment on human neuroblastoma cell lines SK-N-BE (American Type Culture Collection (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)); American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) CRL-2271) and SH-SY5Y (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) CRL-2266) that were maintained in DMEM medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Pan Biotech) (heat-inactivated for 30 min, 56°C) and 1% (v/v) of penicillin (100 U/mL) / streptomycin (100 mg/mL) (Pan Biotech). The SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y cells were seeded at a density of 200,000 cells and 250,000, respectively, per well containing 2 mL of culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 6-well plates in the presence or absence of polyphenols (1.5 to 25 µM), with or without 7KC (50 µM).",251d3477-4382-4329-b5eb-9d47d41dbbc2

Rapamycin (500 nM) was used as an inducer of autophagy: it was simultaneously added to the culture medium with or without 7KC (50 µM). 3-MA, widely used as an autophagy inhibitor, was also simultaneously added to the culture medium with or without 7KC (50 µM).  2.2. Measurement of Cell Viability with the Fluorescein Diacetate (Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA)) Assay The viability of N2a, SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y cells was measured with fluorescein diacetate (Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA)) (Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described [16,17,70].",21e0d150-6c91-4c2f-a8c1-89adc392c926
6,methods6," The Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) assay evaluates the ability of living cells to convert the non-fluorescent Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) into the green fluorescent metabolite fluorescein after cleavage by cellular esterases. The measured signal serves as indicator for viable cells since Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) is a cell-permeant esterase substrate probe. It is considered that Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) positive cells correspond to viable cells, whereas Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) negative cells can be either cells with altered plasma membranes, lower esterase activities or dead cells. At the end of the treatment, cells were incubated in the dark with 15 µg/mL Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) for 5 min at 37 °C, rinsed twice with phosphate buffer saline (phosphate buffer saline (PBS)), and then lysed with 10 mM Tris-HCl solution containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) for 10 min.",d7b86de3-3269-48df-86f6-60c784e7d0ff

All assays were performed in four independent experiments and realized in triplicate. The data were expressed as percentage of the control.  2.3. Evaluation of Adherent Cells by Sulforhodamine 101 Staining As previously reported [70], sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) assay was used to assess the cytotoxic effect of 7KC and polyphenols on N2a cells at different concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 100 µM. SR101 is an anionic dye that electrostatically binds to cellular proteins [16]. SR101 permits the quantification of adherent cells, considered as viable cells, since cell death is associated with a loss of cell adhesion. The experiments were realized four times in triplicate. The data were expressed as percentage of the control.  2.4.",a6be19af-db44-46ae-9163-c610631e1501
8,methods8," Measurement of Polyphenols Uptake by Spectrofluorescence To examine the uptake of resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API), fluorescence measurements were performed on N2a cells incubated with the polyphenols at various concentrations (3.125, 6.25, 12.5 and 25 µM) and times (3, 24 and 48 h), based on the fluorescence properties of polyphenols [71,72,73]. First, the λExmax of resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) were determined by spectrofluorescence with a TECAN fluorescence microplate reader (Sunrise spectrophotometer, TECAN). After fixing the fluorescence emission wavelength at 530 nm, the fluorescence intensity was measured in a 96-well black polystyrene microplate containing the different solutions of polyphenols (10 µM in phosphate buffer saline (phosphate buffer saline (PBS))).",dedac84c-c8fd-421f-9b36-4bd91c82a546
9,methods9," Then, to evaluate the uptake of polyphenols on N2a cells, 1 × 104 cells were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C into 96-well plates in triplicate and the polyphenols were added to the culture medium for an additional period of time (3, 24 and 48 h) at a final concentration of 3.125, 6.25, 12.5 and 25 µM. At the end of treatment, the culture medium was removed, cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and lysed with a 10 mM Tris-HCl solution containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) for 10 min. For each polyphenol, the fluorescence intensity was measured at 530 nm using the corresponding λExmax: resveratrol (RSV): 370 nm; QCT: 450 nm; apigenin (API): 430 nm. Data are expressed as fold increase in the fluorescence intensity per well against the control.  2.5. Flow Cytometric Evaluation of Plasma Membrane Permeability and Cell Death by Staining with Propidium Iodide Cell mortality was measured with propidium iodide (PI).",4ac1cde7-ca13-4a8b-8e01-4a39d4c69093
10,methods10," PI, a hydrophilic probe, is an intercalator of nucleic acids. When excited by a blue light (488 nm), PI produces a red/orange fluorescence. PI enters in the cells with damaged, permeabilized plasma membranes which are considered as dead cells [68]. Flow cytometric evaluation of cellular permeability and cell death with PI was carried out as previously described [70]. Ten thousand cells were acquired for each sample, and the data were analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA) software. All assays were performed with at least in three independent experiments.  2.6. Flow Cytometric Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species(reactive oxygen species (ROS)) with Dihydroethidine Dihydroethidine (Dihydroethidine (DHE)) is a fluorescent probe that measures reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (including superoxide anions (O2•−)) by flow cytometry [69,74].",4b471026-346a-48ca-bf5f-15ff91236e48
11,methods11," Indeed, the non-fluorescent probe (Dihydroethidine (DHE)) is rapidly oxidized by reactive oxygen species (ROS), once it enters the cell, and forms ethidium (HE) which binds to DNA and exhibits an orange/red fluorescence in response to a blue excitation (λEx Max = 488 nm; λEm Max = 575 nm). Dihydroethidine (DHE) (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France) was prepared at 10 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and used at a final concentration of 2 µM. After 48 h of treatment with or without 7KC (50 μM) in the presence or absence of resveratrol (RSV), QCT or apigenin (API) at 3.125 or 6.25 µM, the living and dead cells were collected in a tube and then centrifuged for 5 min at 300× g.

Data were analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star Inc.) software. All assays were performed with at least three independent experiments.  2.7. Flow Cytometric Quantification of Cells with Depolarized Mitochondria with DiOC6(3) The cationic lipophilic dye 3, 3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide DiOC6(3) is a probe that accumulates in the mitochondria proportionally to the value of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) [68]. The higher the ΔΨm, the more the probe accumulates. Thus, mitochondria with a normal ΔΨm will be more fluorescent than depolarized mitochondria, with a low ΔΨm, indicated by a decrease in green fluorescence collected through a 520 ± 10 nm band pass filter on a BD Accuri™ C6 flow cytometer.",f0fe6a1f-0463-4e52-9845-9088cdbda018
13,methods13," At the end of treatments, N2a cells were stained for 15 min at 37 °C with DiOC6(3) (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific) used at 40 nM. For each sample, 10,000 cells were acquired, and data were analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star Inc.) software. All assays were performed with at least three independent experiments.  2.8. Flow Cytometric Measurement of Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) Production with MitoSOX-Red The MitoSOX-Red mitochondrial superoxide indicator is a selective dye used for the detection of superoxide anion (O2•−) in the mitochondria [75]. In the mitochondria, this probe is oxidized by O2•−, and exhibits orange/red fluorescence (λEx = 510 nm; λEm = 580 nm). The oxidation product becomes highly fluorescent upon binding to nucleic acids. Mitochondrial production of O2•− was quantified by flow cytometry after staining with MitoSOX-Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific) initially prepared at 5 mM in phosphate buffer saline (PBS).",2e885f42-6992-42f6-8aff-8dc217a1c356

Quantification of Catalase Activity Catalase, a specific peroxisomal enzyme, degrades hydrogen peroxide into water and molecular oxygen (2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2). Catalase (Catalase (CAT)) activity was determined by measuring the consumption of H2O2 at 240 nm on N2a cells cultured for 48 h with or without 7KC (50 µM) in the absence or in the presence resveratrol (RSV), QCT or apigenin (API) (3.125 µM) [45].

18,methods18," Quantification of Superoxide Dismutase (Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)) Activity The activity of cellular superoxide dismutase (Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)) was measured according to the method of Beauchamp and Fridovich [78]. This method is based on the ability of the superoxide anion (O2•−) to reduce the Nitro blue Tetrazolium (Nitro blue Tetrazolium (NBT)). Under aerobic conditions, the riboflavin, L-methionine and Nitro blue Tetrazolium (NBT) mixture gives a bluish coloration. However, in the presence of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), the oxidation of Nitro blue Tetrazolium (NBT) is inhibited, hence attenuating the blue coloration. The cell lysates were placed in a phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.8), Ethylenediaminetetraacetic (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA)) (0.1 mM), L-methionine (13 mM), riboflavin (2 μM) and Nitro blue Tetrazolium (NBT) (75 mM).

31,methods31," Effects of Resveratrol, Quercetin, Apigenin and 7-Ketocholesterol on Cell Viability and Cell Growth Evaluated with the Fluoresceine Diacetate and Dulforhodamine 101 Assays Whereas the polyphenols are known for their anti-oxidant properties, it is well known that some of them can have cytotoxic activities which depends on the concentration used [76]. Consequently, before simultaneously treating N2a cells in combination with 7KC and resveratrol (RSV), QCT or apigenin (API) for 48 h, we determined the cytotoxicity of these polyphenols. To this end, two assays were choosen: the fluorescein diacetate (Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA)) assay, which is a widely used assay of cytotoxicity based on the measurement of esterase activity [16,17,70], and the sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) assay which permits the quantification of adherent cells to evaluate cell growth [16].",d33e7c35-8033-422c-af51-cf0dcc1e8b86
32,methods32," These two tests were performed because they give complementary information and can be carried out in microplates, allowing easy determination of the 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) values. Compared to untreated cells, and in agreement with previous data [16,70], significant cytotoxic effects were observed with resveratrol (RSV) (Figure 1A,E) and QCT (Figure 1B,F) from 12.5 to 100 µM, whereas slight cytotoxic effects were observed with apigenin (API) at 50 and 100 µM (Figure 1C,G). With 7KC (1.5625 to 100 µM), the IC50 was around 50 µM, both with the Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) and the SR101 assay (Figure 1D–H).  Thus, for further experiments, 7KC was used at 50 µM. So, among the concentrations of polyphenols chosen to assess cytoprotection, concentrations below 12.5 µM were used to avoid cytotoxicity (Figure 1).",55019a64-3d31-46ca-95e3-eb8040dcb405
33,methods33," Of note, measurement of resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) uptake in N2a cells taking into account the fluorescence characteristics of these molecules showed concentration-dependent uptake (in the concentration range 3.125 to 25 µM) at culture times 3, 24 and 48 h (Figure S1).  3.2. Effects of Resveratrol, Quercetin, Apigenin and α-Tocopherol on 7-Ketocholesterol-Induced Plasma Membrane Damage Evaluated by Staining with Propidium Iodide The effects of resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) on 7KC-induced plasma membrane damage was evaluated with propridium iodide (PI). A wide range of polyphenol concentrations was used (1.5 to 25 µM) in order to precisely identify the concentrations capable of preventing plasma membrane damages (increased permeability to PI). PI was chosen to evaluate plasma membrane permeability, due to its ability to enter into cells with damaged and permeable plasma membranes, considered as dead cells [80].",4445e07d-842e-46e2-93a0-48c46ac7aef1
34,methods34,"  With apigenin (API), a slight but significant increase in PI positive cells was observed only at 25 µM (Figure 2C). However, in the presence of 7KC (50 µM, 48 h), the percentage of PI positive cells was strongly increased (Figure 2A–C). When 7KC was simultaneously incubated with resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API), the increase in PI positive cells was significantly attenuated at concentrations from 1.5 to 25 µM: the percentages of PI positive cells were reduced compared to 7KC-treated cells (Figure 2A–C). The most pronounced effects were observed at 3.125 and 6.25 µM, with resveratrol (RSV) and QCT (Figure 2A,B). With apigenin (API), similar cytoprotective effects were observed from 1.5 to 25 µM (Figure 2C). With α-tocopherol (400 µM), used as a reference to prevent 7KC-induced side effects, cytoprotective effects were found with the PI assay (Figure 2).",28fa2606-638c-4bbd-95b5-493a007a43cb
35,methods35,"  Consistent with the results obtained on other adherent cells treated with 7KC, the increased permeability of the plasma membrane to PI was associated with a loss of cell adhesion [81,82]. Thus, an increase in round cells suspended in the culture medium, considered as dead cells, was observed (Figure S2). Cytoprotection associated with resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API), as well as by α-tocopherol, was accompanied by a restoration of cell adhesion. No marked morphological differences were detected between untreated cells (control), cells treated with vehicles (ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and cells treated with resveratrol (RSV), QCT, apigenin (API) and α-tocopherol. However, in the presence of the polyphenols and at the low concentrations used, some cells with dendrites that may result from the differentiating activity of the polyphenols [15,16] were sometimes observed.",42b80ca7-6f05-413f-84a4-c9973e4badab
36,methods36,"  To ensure that the cytoprotection against 7KC observed with polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), QCT, apigenin (API)) was not species and neuronal cell type dependent, human SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y nerve cells were used. In SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y cells, under co-treatment conditions and using the Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) test, cytoprotection was also observed with resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) (Figures S3 and S4). The most effective cytoprotective concentrations were usually 3.125, 6.25 and/or 12.5 µM (Figures S3 and S4).  In addition, when cells were pre-treated with polyphenols, prior to the addition of 7KC, equivalent and sometimes higher cytoprotection were observed than in co-treatment (Figure S5). On the other hand, in post-treatment, the cytoprotection observed was always lower than in co-treatment and pre-treatment (Figure S5).

Catalase is a peroxisomal enzyme which is increased in oxidative stress conditions and which allows the dismutation of hydrogen peroxide in water and dioxygen (2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2).,e7002cef-d37b-4c2b-8aef-6c6d29c871a6
39,methods39," We also measured the mRNA and protein level of the transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2) which activates the expression of numerous genes encoding for enzymes involved in the prevention of oxidative stress such as quinine oxidoreductase (NQO1), hemeoxigenase 1 (HMOX1) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) [83]. Under our experimental conditions, 7KC induced a marked reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction (increased percentage of Dihydroethidine (DHE) positive cells), which was strongly counteracted by resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API); apigenin (API) was the most efficient compared to resveratrol (RSV) and QCT, but also relative to α-tocopherol (400 µM) used as positive cytoprotective molecule (Figure 3A).",a09c8917-3a83-4bf2-8ef1-08de6871e900
40,methods40," 7KC also simultaneously induced an important increase in catalase activity; this increase was reduced by resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API); apigenin (API) was the most efficient compared with resveratrol (RSV) and QCT, but also to α-tocopherol used as positive cytoprotective molecule (Figure 3A). resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) as well as α-tocopherol, used alone, have no or slight effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and catalase activity (Figure 3A).  Measurement of enzyme activities also showed a decrease in GPx and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activities in the presence of 7KC; the decrease in these activities was strongly and significantly attenuated in the presence of resveratrol (RSV), QCT, apigenin (API) and α-tocopherol, without returning to levels similar to those of control and vehicle-treated cells (Figure 3B,C).",321608d3-ff06-4163-b98f-2122757ada51
41,methods41," In the presence of 7KC, compared to control cells, the relative expression of Gpx1 and Nrf2 mRNAs were strongly reduced (Figure 4A,B), whereas the relative expression of Sod1 and Sod2 was increased (Figure 4C,D). No significant differences were observed between control and vehicle-treated cells (EtOH (0.2%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (0.2%) (Figure 4A–D). When associated with 7KC, the polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API)), as well as α-tocopherol, tended to normalize the expression of GPx1, Nrf2, Sod1 and Sod2 (Figure 4A–D). These data demonstrate the benefit of resveratrol (RSV), QCT, apigenin (API) and α-tocopherol on GPx1, Nrf2, Sod1 and Sod2 gene expression. Compared to control cells, resveratrol (RSV) used alone has no effect on the mRNA levels of GPx1, Nrf2, Sod1 and Sod2 (Figure 4A–D), whereas QCT and apigenin (API) increased the Nrf2 mRNA level (Figure 4B). With α-tocopherol, the Nrf2 mRNA level was also enhanced (Figure 4B).",7058e1dc-1c82-421b-a074-714ce1947d92
42,methods42," On the other hand, the measurement of the amount of GPx1, Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)1, Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)2 and catalase proteins by Western blot revealed decreases in the expression of GPx1 and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)1 and increases in Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)2 and catalase in the presence of 7KC (Figure 5). When resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) as well as α-tocopherol were associated with 7KC, these changes were strongly and significantly attenuated, and the values observed were close to those observed in control and vehicle-treated cells (Figure 5). Altogether, these data show that 7KC induces oxidative stress on N2a cells, and that this effect is prevented by resveratrol (RSV), QCT, apigenin (API) and α-tocopherol.  3.4.",069eb276-1069-4a6f-bb40-5003f0f1c567
43,methods43," Effects of Resveratrol, Quercetin and Apigenin on 7-Ketocholesterol-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction DiOC6(3) and MitoSOX are widely used to study the drop of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction at the mitochondrial level, respectively. Under treatment with 7KC (50 µM, 48 h), an important increase in N2a cells with depolarized mitochondria (percentages of DiOC6(3) negative cells) was observed, as well as an increase in cells characterized by an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the mitochondrial level (percentage of MitoSOX positive cells) (Figure 6A,B).  Notably, the loss of ΔΨm was prevented by co-treatment with resveratrol (RSV), QCT or apigenin (API) used at 3.125 and 6.25 µM (apigenin (API) being the most efficient) and by α-tocopherol (400 µM) (Figure 6A).",81cc610a-c39c-4ff5-aef4-eb8cedb75307
44,methods44," The overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the mitochondrial level was also strongly and equally reduced by resveratrol (RSV), QCT, apigenin (API) and α-tocopherol (Figure 6B). By RT-qPCR, under treatment with 7KC, we also observed an important reduction in the mRNA levels of Ampkα1, Sirt1 and Pgc-1α encoding for proteins which favor mitochondrial biogenesis [84] (Figure 7A–C).  When N2a cells were cultured with 7KC associated with resveratrol (RSV), QCT or apigenin (API), or with α-tocopherol, the decrease in the mRNA levels was counteracted, and the mRNAs levels of Ampkα1, Sirt1 and Pgc-1α were similar to those in in untreated N2a cells (Figure 7A–C). Western blot measurement of the amount of protein AMPKα, SIRT1 and PGC-1α revealed decreases in the level of SIRT1 and PGC-1α in the presence of 7KC whereas AMPKα level was unchanged (Figure 5).",4ecfe3bf-4965-4c89-a426-06e2bd15b0cd
45,methods45," When resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) or α-tocopherol were associated with 7KC, these changes were strongly and significantly attenuated, and the values observed were close to those measured on control and vehicle-treated cells (Figure 5). Thus, the effects of 7KC at the mitochondrial level (loss of ΔΨm; mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction; reduction in the mRNA and/or protein levels of Ampkα, SIRT1 and PGC-1α) are prevented by resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API), as well as by α-tocopherol.  3.5. Effects of Resveratrol, Quercetin, Apigenin and α-Tocopherol on 7-Ketocholesterol-Induced Peroxisomal Dysfunction The incidence of 7KC on the peroxisomal mass was evaluated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the peroxisomal ABCD3 transporter, which is a major protein of the peroxisomal membrane, as previously described [43,68].",09c13779-eb52-48dd-a321-5a894768b161
46,methods46," The impact on the peroxisomal mass and biogenesis was also evaluated by RT-qPCR via the quantification of Abcd3, Pex13 and Pex14 mRNAs. The peroxines 13 and 14 (PEX13, PEX14) constitute a docking complex localized at the peroxisomal membrane level and are required for peroxisome biogenesis [85]. The negative impact on the peroxisomal β-oxidation, which could favor neurodegeneration [86], was also evaluated by RT-qPCR via the quantification of the mRNAs encoding the ABCD1 transporter, and of the enzymes acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), multifunctional protein-2 (MFP2) and thiolase A which are required for the β-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids (very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)) [87] (Figure S6). In agreement with previous data obtained on 158N and BV-2 cells [45,76], an increase in the percentage of cells with lower ABCD3 expression, suggesting a decrease in peroxisomal mass per cell, was observed (Figure 8).",02b7fc76-e2f5-4d86-8b80-603d0f9244ae
47,methods47," This increase was attenuated by resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) (Figure 8).  In addition, as shown by RT-qPCR, the important decreases in Abcd3, Pex13 and Pex14 mRNA levels, observed under treatment with 7KC (50 µM, 48 h) were prevented by co-treatment with resveratrol (RSV), QCT or apigenin (API) (3.125 µM), as well as α-tocopherol (400 µM) (Figure 9). In addition, 7KC also induced a decreased gene expression (Abcd1, Acox1, Mfp2 and thiolase A), which was significantly attenuated by co-treatment with resveratrol (RSV), QCT, apigenin (API) (3.125 µM) or α-tocopherol (400 µM) (Figure 10). By Western blot, decreases in the peroxisomal proteins ABCD1 and MFP2, associated with peroxisomal β-oxidation (Figure S6), were also found in the presence of 7KC (Figure 5). When resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) were associated with 7KC, these decreases were attenuated (Figure 5).",5756055e-3bac-41ce-bf39-eed69758ced8
48,methods48," Compared to 7KC, α-tocopherol associated with 7KC increased the expression of ABCD1 and MFP2 (Figure 5). These data show that 7KC-induced peroxisomal changes impacts peroxisomal mass, biogenesis and activity, and that these changes are attenuated by resveratrol (RSV), QCT, apigenin (API) or α-tocopherol.  3.6. Characteristics of 7-Ketocholesterol-Induced Cell Death in N2a Cells: Evidence of Apoptotic and Autophagic Criteria, and Determination of the Effects of Resveratrol, Quercetin, Apigenin or α-Tocopherol It is now well established in many cells that 7KC is a potent inducer of apoptosis and autophagy [29,30]. We described in human promonocytic U937 cells, murine microglial BV-2 cells and murine oligodendrocyte 158N cells, that 7KC induces a mode of cell death associated with oxidative stress and some characteristics of apoptosis and autophagy, named oxiapoptophagy [29,30].",8b1debdf-3280-4e6b-8b98-f4ab5da5eb22
49,methods49," In murine neuroblastoma N2a cells, it was therefore important to characterize the mode of cell death induced under treatment with 7KC in the presence or absence of resveratrol (RSV), QCT, apigenin (API) (3.125 µM), or of α-tocopherol (400 µM), used as reference for cytoprotection. In the present study, under treatment with 7KC (50 µM, 48 h), several cells with fragmented and/or condensed nuclei, characteristic of apoptotic cells were identified by fluorescence microscopy after nuclei staining with Hoechst 33342 (Figure 11A). This induction of apoptosis was biochemically characterized by a cleavage of caspase-3 (presence of the 17 kDa cleaved sub-unit), leading to the activation of caspase-3 supported by the fragmentation of Poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) (presence of the 89 kDa cleaved fragment) (Figure 11B).",2b9b41ca-7b24-4793-8a13-8ac077a7a180
50,methods50," Under treatment with 7KC, autophagy was characterized by the presence of several monodansyl cadaverine (monodansylcadaverine (MDC)) positive vacuoles, considered as autophagic vacuoles detected by fluorescence microscopy [88] and by the conversion of LC3-I (18 kDa) to LC3-II (16 kDa) (increased ratio (LC3-II/LC3-I)) revealed by Western blotting (Figure 11B and Figure S7). By using rapamycin (an autophagy activator), cell death assessed by the Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) test was decreased (the number of positive Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) cells increased in the assay (7KC + rapamycin) compared to 7KC); on the other hand, in the presence of 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor), cell death was increased (the number of positive Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) cells was decreased in the assay (7KC + 3-MA) compared to 7KC) suggesting that on N2a cells survival autophagy was activated by 7KC (Figure S8),",30abf143-6e0a-456b-8037-ae742560024d
51,methods51," When N2a cells were simultaneously treated with 7KC associated with resveratrol (RSV), QCT, apigenin (API) or α-tocopherol, apoptosis was inhibited and autophagy was normalized: the presence of cells with fragmented and/or condensed nuclei was strongly reduced as well as the presence of cells with several monodansylcadaverine (MDC) positive vacuoles (Figure 11A and Figure S7). In addition, by Western blotting, when 7KC was added with resveratrol (RSV), QCT or apigenin (API), the levels of cleaved caspase-3, fragmented Poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) and LC3-II form were strongly reduced compared to 7KC alone (Figure 11B). In control and vehicle-treated cells (EtOH 0.2%; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 0.2%) and in resveratrol (RSV)-, QCT-, apigenin (API)- and α-tocopherol-treated cells no signs of apoptosis and autophagy were observed (Figure 11).",0cc28634-5792-4a53-9daa-4b645f88f9bf
52,methods52," Thus, in N2a cells, 7KC induces a mode of cell death simultaneously associated with apoptotic and autophagic criteria which is prevented by resveratrol (RSV), QCT, apigenin (API) or α-tocopherol.  4. Discussion In the present study, the cytotoxicity of 7KC was characterized in neuronal N2a cells and the ability of polyphenols, abundant in the Mediterranean diet (resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API)), to counteract the harmful effects of this oxysterol was determined. Preventing the cytotoxicity of 7KC with polyphenols could be a means of treating certain neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress resulting from increased levels of 7KC, such as AD [32] as well as other age-related diseases [28,31]. The results obtained with the three polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API)) show that these molecules are oppose 7KC-induced oxiaoptophagy.",a340eeec-ae52-4341-8f0c-097b2d7762ee
53,methods53," Thus, resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) greatly reduce oxidative stress, organelle dysfunction (mitochondria, peroxisome), as well as the activation of apoptosis and autophagy.  As it was reported on murine 158N oligodendrocytes [40] and murine BV-2 microglial cells [45] that 7KC induced a mode of cell death by oxiapoptophagy [41,89], we characterized 7KC-induced cell death in murine neuronal N2a cells. In agreement with data obtained on nerve cells, 158N and BV-2 cells, but also on human promonocytic U937 cells [41] and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells [46], our data demonstrate that 7KC induces an oxiapoptophagic mode of cell death in N2a cells. On these cells, cell death induced by 7KC was studied after 48 h of treatment in a range of concentrations from 1.5625 to 100 µM. While no toxicity was observed with 7KC (1.5625, 3.125, 6.25, 12.",6e60f5fc-2f94-467d-aa1f-7f467d363932
54,methods54,"5 and 25 µM), significant cytotoxic effects were identified at 50 and 100 µM with two complementary tests: the Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) assay (evaluating esterase activity) and the SR101 assay (evaluating adherent cells) [16]. Under these conditions, the IC50 value of 7KC was 50 µM. So, the cell characteristics of 7KC-induced cell death were determined at this concentration.  In agreement with previous data obtained on other cell types, 7KC induced an important increase in plasma membrane permeability which could be the consequence of plasma membrane alteration due to oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction measured with Dihydroethidine (DHE)) [40,45].",553b3c9f-877b-49b6-9c61-3d6ef7f42df8
55,methods55," This important oxidative stress was associated with modifications of anti-oxidant enzymes (catalase, GPx1, Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)1 and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)2): catalase activity was enhanced whereas Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and GPx activities were decreased; GPx1 mRNAs level was decreased, whereas Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)1 and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)2 mRNAs levels were enhanced; the protein levels of GPx1 and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)1 were reduced, whereas those of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)2 and catalase were enhanced. In addition, at the mRNA level, we also observed a down-regulation of the nuclear transcription factor Nrf2 which up-regulates numerous proteins contributing to prevention of damage due to oxidative stress [53,54].",94a84d0c-8e7e-442f-bb7a-9b8e933e2c25
56,methods56,"  Altogether, as 7KC is known to induce many organelle dysfunction consistent with its sub-cellular distribution [90]; this lead us to characterize the impact of 7KC at the mitochondrial and peroxisomal levels since such alterations have been described on several 7KC-treated glial and microglial cells. It is noteworthy that 7KC-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was associated with a mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction identified with MitoSOX. In addition, under treatment with 7KC, a decrease in AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKα), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) mRNAs encoding for proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis was also observed. However, at the protein level, SIRT1 and PGC1-α were decreased whereas AMPKα was unchanged. Such differences suggest different kinetics of synthesis and/or degradation between these proteins.",55076138-a0bf-4112-8d1b-029aa6c677d4
57,methods57," As the mitochondria and peroxisome are tighly connected organelles [91,92], the impact of 7KC on the peroxisomal mass, biogenesis and activity was also studied. Thus, lower levels of the ABCD3 transporter, considered a peroxisomal mass marker taking into account the abundance and the size of peroxisomes [93], was observed by flow cytometry in 7KC-treated cells, as well as a decreased expresssion of genes associated with peroxisomal biogenesis (Pex13, Pex14) and peroxisomal β-oxidation (Abcd1, Acox1, Mfp2, Thiolase A) [85,87,94]. In addition, the protein levels of the peroxisomal transporter ABCD1 and of the peroxisomal enzyme MFP2 were reduced. These peroxisomal dysfunctions observed in N2a cells evocate those described in 158N murine oligodendrocytes and BV-2 microglial cells [40,45], suggesting that the deleterious effects of 7KC observed on these organelles do not depend on the type of nerve cells concerned (glial cells, microglial cells or neurons).",d8c63996-2269-48ff-8a91-8f4408e1916b
58,methods58,"  7KC-induced cell death also presented characteristic of apoptosis (cells with fragmented and/or condensed nuclei; cleaved caspase-3 and Poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) fragmentation) associated with autophagic criteria (cells with monodansyl cadaverine positive vacuoles; activation of LC3-I to LC3-II). In 7KC-treated N2a cells, the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and/or the accumulation of LC3-labeled autophagosomes revealed by staining with monodansylcadaverine might be due to the blockade of this pathway at a later stage, as happens for some autophagy blockers such as chloroquine [95,96,97]. Furthermore, an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation has also been reported to ultimately prevent the fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes and could therefore contribute to increase LC3-II level [95].",828e56b3-191e-4a84-b908-6297b49a48c6
59,methods59," Altogether, our present results demonstrate that 7KC also induces a type of death by oxiapoptophagy on N2a cells and confirm in nerve cells that the type of autophagy activated by 7KC is survival autophagy, such as that described on 7KC-treated cells of the vascular wall (macrophages, smooth muscle cells) [43,98,99], as well as on 7β-hydroxycholesterol-treated rat C6 glioma cells [88]. Our data bring new evidence that 7KC-induced oxiapoptophagy is independent of the cell type and of the species considered, since it can be observed on monocytic cells [43], human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells [46], murine glial and microglial cells [40,45] and also murine neuronal N2a cells. The fact that oxiapoptophagy is a highly conserved cell death from one type of cell to another has important consequences for preventing the age-related diseases associated with 7KC.",a4146d0e-f03b-4fb9-b4fb-b1868638e996
60,methods60," Indeed, for the latter, molecules capable of opposing oxiapoptophagy could have a systemic effect and therefore a significant general impact on aging. In addition, as 7KC induces death by oxiapoptophagy in the three main cell types of the central nervous system (neuronal, microglial and glial cells) [29,30], identifying molecules which inhibit oxiapoptophagy should theorically allow neurodegeneration to be counteracted.  In our laboratory, in order to inhibit or reduce oxiapoptophagy induced by 7KC, the signaling pathways of which have been described and summarized by Vejux et al. [29] and Brahmi et al. [30], we have chosen a strategy based on the use of synthetic molecules, natural molecules or mixtures of molecules (oils, phenolic extracts) [30,100,101]. At the moment, few molecules are able to attenuate the cytotoxic effects of 7KC in vitro when treating cells either before the addition of 7KC, or simultaneously.",317635d2-dbde-43f9-834d-9f913a56f8a3
61,methods61," Among the synthetic molecules are two activators of the Nrf2 pathway, dimethyl fumarate and its major metabolite, monomethyl fumarate, which have shown cytoprotective effects in 158N cells not only on 7KC but also on 7β-hydroxycholesterol, which can also be formed by auto- oxidation of cholesterol as well as enzymatically from 7KC via the enzyme 11β-HSD1 [55,56]. Some lipids, such as α-tocopherol (the main component of Vitamin E constituted of four tocopherols and four tocotrienols), oleic acid (C18:1 n-9: the main fatty acid of olive oil) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6 n-3: abundant in oily and blue fishes as salmon, trout, sardines, herrings, mackerel and tuna) also have important cytoprotective activities against 7KC in different cell types, including nerve cells; they strongly reduce oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction (loss of ΔΨm), peroxisomal changes, apoptosis and autophagy [29,30,93,102].",41bcbb06-0bcd-4a42-8f90-cea823cce08e
62,methods62," It has been clearly established that α-tocopherol prevents the accumulation of 7KC in the lipid rafts, inhibiting thus the cascade of events leading to cell death [68,103,104]. It was also reported that argan, olive and milk thistle seed oils are capable of counteracting 7KC-induced oxiapoptophagy [105,106]. However, there is no study on the effects of polyphenols on oxiapoptophagy. It has been reported on ARPE-19 retinal epithelial cells that resveratrol (RSV) attenuates 7KC-induced cell death [21]. resveratrol (RSV) also counteracts inflammation in human M1 and M2 macrophages upon challenge with 7KC [107], and in C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells, white mustard and coriander extracts rich in polyphenols have shown antioxidant activities [108]. In addition, in intestinal cells, an oxysterol mixture composed of 42.96% 7KC, 32.3%, 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol, 5.76% 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol, 4.26% 7α-hydroxycholesterol, and 14.",f3d80753-9c05-47be-bfe4-5fe147d848bb
63,methods63,"71% 7β-hydroxycholesterol, to a final concentration of 60 μM induces inflammation and oxidative stress which are prevented by olive oil phenolic extracts which directly modulate p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2 phosphorylation and activation of NF-kB; the phenolic extract also inhibited inducible Nitrous Oxide Synthase (iNOS) induction, keeping NO concentration at the control level [58,59]. The present study demonstrates for the first time cytoprotective activities of some polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API)) present in the Mediterranean diet on 7KC-induced oxiapoptophagy, and confirms the potential of polyphenols in prevention of 7KC-induced cytotoxicity. The cytoprotective effects of resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) were studied at 3.125 and 6.25 µM because at higher concentrations (from 12.5 µM) resveratrol (RSV) and QCT, in agreement with previous results, activate the death of N2a cells [16].",fee36b86-1de4-4c9a-bb0a-bf7adee66b92
64,methods64," These cytotoxic effects are probably related to the anti-tumor activities of these two polyphenols observed for concentrations close to 50 µM [109,110]. In contrast, apigenin (API) up to 100 µM does not induce cell death. Despite these differences in toxicity, at concentrations of 3.125 and 6.25 µM, resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) have similar cytoprotective effects against 7KC. Thus, resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) similarly attenuate oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction at whole cell level and at mitochondrial level, down regulation (GPx1, Nrf2) and up-regulation (Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)1, Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)2) of gene expression) and apoptosis (fragmentation and/or condensation of the nuclei; caspase-3 cleavage and Poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) fragmentation) and prevent autophagy (induction of monodansyl cadaverine positive vacuole formation; activation of LC3-I to LC3-II).",c67e3f81-6ea7-400d-a925-db026381ed96
65,methods65," Since 7KC-induced survival autophagy associated with mitophagy, pexophagy and reticulophagy, autophagy could be considered a consequence of oxidative stress, inhibiting oxidative stress by resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) would prevent the activation of autophagy and normalize its activity. The three polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API)) are thus added to the short list of natural molecules (α-tocopherol, oleic acid (C18:1 n-9), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n-3) and synthetic molecules (dimethyl fumarate, monomethyl fumarate) which efficiently prevent 7KC-induced oxiapoptophagy [29,30]. In addition, on N2a cells, resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) prevent 7KC-induced organelle dysfunction. In N2a cells, our data support that 7KC-induced apoptosis activates the mitochondrial pathway due to a marked loss of ΔΨm which is also prevented by resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API).",a78e20b4-f108-4d3b-9646-45e5cdefbd4e
66,methods66," As QCT, resveratrol (RSV) and apigenin (API) also prevent the decreased gene expression and the decreased protein level of SIRT1 and PGC-1α implicated in the control of mitochondrial biogenesis, our data also suggest that 7KC-induced oxiapoptophagy reduces mitochondrial biogenesis and that the three polyphenols used counteract this effect. The ability of resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) to prevent 7KC-induced peroxisomal changes was also studied on N2a cells for the following reasons: i) it is now well established that mitochondrial dysfunction can impact peroxisomal activity, and thi occurs reciprocally [91,92], and ii) we previously reported in murine microglial BV-2 cells and in murine oligodendrocytes 158N cells that 7KC induced morphological, topographical and functional peroxisomal changes [41,44,45,76].",13bca78c-ca56-422b-a21b-53bf30390421
67,methods67," Our data clearly established that resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) counteract the decrease in ABCD3 (considered as a marker of peroxisomal mass) at the protein and mRNA levels, the decrease protein level of ABCD1 and MFP2 involved in the peroxisomal β-oxidation as well as the decreased expresssion of genes associated with peroxisomal biogenesis (Pex13, Pex14) and peroxisomal β-oxidation (Abcd1, Acox1, Mfp2, Thiolase A). In N2a cells, in agreement with data obtained on 158N murine oligodendrocytes and murine microglial BV-2 cells [44,76], our results underline that 7KC induces both mitochondrial and peroxisome dysfunction, which justifies paying more attention to these organelles, which could constitute new therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases.",ff0198de-8768-4bb1-8ff9-c372fd3195d9
68,methods68," As cytoprotective effects were observed with α-tocopherol, which also prevent 7KC-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagy on BV-2 and 158N cells [29,30], it is suggested that 7KC-induced oxiapoptophagy probably activates similar signaling pathways in 158N, BV-2 and N2a cells.  Hence, the three polyphenols studied (resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API)) at concentrations in the range of 3 to 6 µM have significant cytoprotective activities towards 7KC. Nevertheless, when these polyphenols are provided by food or in the form of food supplements, they may be subject to more or less pronounced degradation by the gut microbiota [111]. Moreover, these polyphenols have to pass numerous barriers such as intestinal and hemato-encephalic barriers if we are to consider their tissue effects and in particular at the cerebral level.",e0bbbb81-8e3f-48af-b9c3-16c4856af42e
69,methods69," In addition, these molecules have a short plasma half life and are rapidly metabolized leading to the formation of glucurono, sulfo or tauro-conjugates [111]. While some of these secondary metabolites are inactive, others may have beneficial activities [112]; consequently, for each polyphenol, identifying stable and bioactive metabolites is of therapeutic interest. In vitro, alternative methods to animal experimentation (Lab on Chips), including several cell types in a dynamic context (microfluidic), would make it possible to specify whether polyphenols but especially their metabolites can efficiently pass a succession of different barriers and are active on defined target cells [29]. Studying the metabolism of polyphenols by nerve cells is also possible in vitro from primary cultures of glial, microglial and neuronal cells as well as using recognized nerve cell lines as models: 158N, BV-2, SK-N-BE, SH-SY5Y and N2a cells.",909ea33f-af75-4a99-95f3-dcc05673cf3c
70,methods70," These cell lines could also be used in co-cultures to evaluate, in the context of oxiapoptophagy, the impact of one cell type on another. At the moment, in order to preserve in vivo the in vitro activities of polyphenols, micro- and nano-encapsulation strategies that have already been proven (including at the level of the central nervous system) are possible [113,114,115,116,117]. In addition, as 7KC induces major organelle dysfunction (mitochondria, peroxisome), targeting of these organelles by functionalized nanoparticles could also be considered (Targeted Organelle Nano therapy: TORN therapy) to oppose the toxicity of 7KC [30,101]. Currently, there are several lines of evidence that new nanoformulations of polyphenols (resveratrol (RSV), QCT) strongly improve the bioavailability of these polyphenols in vivo [118,119] and this makes it possible to envisage therapeutic applications with these molecules.",7727fd87-0cbf-4e92-a37b-e53da50d5d43
71,methods71," Using iron nanoparticles, this would have the advantage of implementing targeted therapies. One can also imagine synthesizing lipophilic cationic derivatives of resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) in order to target the mitochondria and to inhibit the dysfunctions (reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, drop of ΔΨm) induced by 7KC. It is also possible that aza- or azo-stilbenes deriving from resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) may have greater therapeutic potential than the original natural molecules [120].  In conclusion, on murine N2a cells as well as on human SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y cells, resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) used at low concentrations (3.125 and 6.25 µM) prevent 7KC (50 µM)-induced cell death. The cytoprotection with these polyphenols is more efficient in pre- and co-treatment than in post-treatment.",c4c778e9-cb72-4177-aa12-3e4428e40e37
72,methods72," In addition, on N2a cells, 7KC induces a mode of cell death by oxiapoptophagy which is attenuated by resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) reinforcing the interest in these polyphenols for the prevention of neurodegeneration. The oxidative stress as well as the mitochondrial and peroxisomal dysfunction associated with 7KC-induced oxiapoptophagy are strongly reduced. Since 7KC is associated with cardiovascular diseases, eye diseases (cataract, AMD) and bowel diseases [28,30,31,59], our data support that these polyphenols widely represented in the Mediterranean diet, which can be incorporated in food supplements, could be of interest to prevent and/or treat these age-related and chronic inflammatory diseases. However, from a pharmacological point of view, due to the limited bioavailability of polyphenols in vivo, chemical and galenic strategies should be considered and must be developed to preserve their efficacy.",88c9d376-0cf7-440b-bb7f-e7360883abe4
73,methods73," In addition, whereas resveratrol (RSV), QCT and apigenin (API) (used at 3.125 and 6.25 µM) are equivalent in terms of cytoprotection against 7KC, they have variable toxicities from concentrations of 12.5 µM and above. Indeed, while apigenin (API) is only slightly toxic at 50 and 100 µM, a marked induction of cell death was observed with resveratrol (RSV) and QCT from 12.5 µM. This gives apigenin (API) an advantage in considering therapeutic applications. apigenin (API) also has a neurotrophic activity: antioxidant activities and induction of neuronal differentiation [16]. Given these characteristics, compared to resveratrol (RSV) and QCT, which have cytoprotective activities in a reduced concentration range, apigenin (API) therefore presents a potentially more attractive profile for treatment of age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration.
