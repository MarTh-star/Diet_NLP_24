0,introduction0,"With a continuously aging population, the impact of chronic diseases and dependencies, for which no specific cures are available, increases dramatically. This transitional social phenomenon, that affects individuals and societies, poses a real threat for current health care systems worldwide. Unfortunately, in a number of countries, healthy life expectancy appears not to follow the same increasing trend as life expectancy. For instance, within the EU, whereas it has been described that human life expectancy by the age of 50 has risen by 1.2 years between 2005 and 2010, healthy life expectancy for the same period of time has only increased slightly . This condition is favored by phenomena such as social and economic crises, that lead to increased inequalities between these countries in healthy lifespan.",f2ce61af-290d-4ee2-acbd-172795dd98aa
1,introduction1," Within this frame, EU action plans would inevitably recruit and encompass scientific research strategies that would be focused in the improvement of the quality of life in old age. In support, a wide gamut of epidemiological data has elucidated the beneficial role of specific dietary interventions in combatting and delaying the aging process and accompanying pathologies, such as age-related diseases, frailty, disability, morbidity and mortality, both in animal models and humans. Those pathologies have been largely associated with a physiological phenomenon, characterized by the establishment of a chronic and low grade inflammatory status in the elderly, so called “inflammaging” (Franceschi et al., 2000, 2007; Cevenini et al., 2013).",65c2f673-9e78-43bc-b07e-a5e8af687c78
2,introduction2," Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) has been extensively investigated by several observational, longitudinal and randomized-controlled studies for its pivotal role in the prevention of a wide range of chronic age-related pathological conditions and the reduction of all causes of mortality . In particular, the traditional MedDiet, a cultural heritage of humanity, characterized by consumption of non-starchy vegetables, fruits, cereals, legumes, cold pressed olive oil, low intake of meat, fish, and dairy products and a moderate consumption of alcohol, provides a balanced combination of nutrients that have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and prebiotic activity, and also elicits an integrated network of cellular mechanisms of stress/oxidative damage response .",7d808a58-9712-4c86-95df-6d21ca637fa7
3,introduction3," Numerous epidemiological studies in populations showing adherence to MedDiet have indicated it’s protective effect against stroke, cardiovascular disease, obesity, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, hypertension, diabetes, and allergic reactions . Although the exact underpinning mechanism by which the traditional MedDiet lowers the risk of certain cancers, metabolic and cardiovascular disorders has not been fully depicted, however, many potential mechanisms have been proposed as the major mediators of its beneficial effects. Those encompass its lipid lowering effect, combatting oxidative stress, along with inflammation and platelet aggregation, metabolic regulation of different molecular pathways associated with tumorigenesis, tumor progression, nutrient- sensing and gut-microbiota . Certain phytochemicals typically found in MedDiet, such as lignans, ferulic acid, spermidine, apigenin, phytic acid, etc.",65128e02-880a-4611-bd49-9ebc034d3ec8
4,introduction4,", encountered essentially in whole grains and olive oil, have been proved to possess anti- inflammatory and anti-oxidant potential via reducing inflammation and cell necrosis during aging, increasing autophagy and regulating ER stress modulators such as histone acetyltransferases, the inhibition of which leads to higher resistance to oxidative stress . To this end the European project (NU-AGE) was established to test the possibility to reduce inflammaging through a newly designed, personally tailored Mediterranean dietary pattern (MedDiet), designed to meet the nutritional needs of people over 65 years of age (NU-AGE diet) . The NU-AGE project was also aimed to unravel the cellular and molecular pathways that are affected by the MedDiet by a comprehensive monitoring of a variety of domains using an integrated classical, -omic and systems biology approach .",37eb74b6-59c9-4533-965b-ce2951359522
5,introduction5,"  One aspect that has emerged as an important factor associated with effective counteracting of inflammaging is the maintenance of proteostasis. The proteasome, being the main proteolytic cellular system, plays a crucial role in maintaining proteostasis . Specifically, the UPS is involved in the regulated degradation of non-functional or excessive proteins and participates in numerous and diverse cellular functions. The 20S proteasome is a barrel-like structure composed of 28 protein subunits that form a complex of 700 kDa. The two outer rings comprise seven different α subunits, while the interior rings consist of seven β subunits, creating a α1-7/β1-7/β1-7/α1-7 layout. The external α rings control the entry of proteasome’s substrates into the β rings, where the proteolytic activity is held. The α-subunits additionally bind different regulatory factors related with the activity and specificity of the catalytic core.",e150e7b7-84df-4474-b4d6-6f34ddcaccd6
6,introduction6," β1, β2, and β5 out of the 7 β subunits show proteolytic activity, bearing different substrate specificity. Specifically, β1 has a caspase-like activity (CL or PGPH), β2 a trypsin-like (TL) and β5 a CT-L. The protein hydrolysis occurs after acidic peptide bonds, basic amino acids and hydrophobic amino acids, respectively. Professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs, such as dendritic cells), a specific cell population capable of triggering T- cell activation, express an alternative form of proteasome in which the catalytic β1, β2, and β5 subunits are replaced with β1i (LMP2), β2i (LMP10), and β5i (LMP7), respectively (Chondrogianni et al., 2015a).",9eb6e62c-bfcf-4268-b63b-bfe54dfa6c04
7,introduction7," Immunoproteasomes are considered to be related with enhanced antigen presentation and processing, as they are constitutively expressed in APCs, but also because two of the aforementioned immunosubunits are encoded by genes located on the same chromosome with genes encoding major histocompatibility complex (major histocompatibility complex (MHC)) class II and TAP (Zanker and Chen, 2014). Importantly, it has been demonstrated that the accumulation of damaged proteins during aging is linked to an age-related decline in proteasome content and activities, which in turn, is due to the down-regulation of the catalytic subunits of the 20S complex . Stable over-expression of proteasome’s catalytic subunits restores proteasome activities and function, while the “proteasome activated” human cell lines exhibited a significant delay of senescence .",ad28e36b-77cd-402c-96be-b11538a6d2a4
8,introduction8," Recent findings also propose that proteasome activation is an evolutionary conserved mechanism, as it can delay aging in vivo and it also confers deceleration of aggregation-related pathologies, such as Alzheimer’s or Huntington’s diseases (Chondrogianni et al., 2015b; Papaevgeniou et al., 2016). Therefore, given these findings we examined in this study whether proteasome levels and activity as well as levels of oxidized/carbonylated proteins and immunoproteasome levels were affected by implementation of the aforementioned dietary intervention.

9,methods0,"Study Design and Samples Selection The NU-AGE study is a 1-year, randomized, parallel trial carried out in five European study centers (Bologna, Italy; Norwich, United Kingdom; Wageningen, Netherlands; Warsaw, Poland; and Clermont-Ferrand, France). Recruitment started in April 2012 and finished in January 2014 including 1,296 apparently healthy European men and women aged 65–79 years. The rationale and design of this intervention study are described in detail elsewhere . In short, participants completed questionnaires about their health and lifestyle and a 7-day food record to obtain information about their dietary intake. Tests were conducted to measure a wide range of health outcomes. All questionnaires and measurements were repeated after 1 year. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to the intervention arm (NU-AGE diet), while the remaining fifty percent were controls (they continued to follow their habitual dietary habits).",3157e046-98de-4060-946c-61299e5f48d4

11,methods2," This sub-group included half pre-frail and half non-frail subjects matched per gender and age, belonging to the intervention arm. Frailty was based on the five criteria proposed by Fried et al. (2001) including weight loss, weakness (i.e., poor handgrip strength), self-reported exhaustion, slowness (i.e., slow gait speed), and low physical activity. Weight loss was defined as self-reported unintentional loss (i.e., not due to diet or physical exercise) of ≥4.5 kg in the last 12 months. Handgrip strength was measured three times in the dominant hand using the Scandidact Smedley’s Hand Dynamometer®. Weakness was defined as the average handgrip strength equal or below the sex- and BMI-specific cutoffs provided by Fried et al. (2001). Two questions from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale were administered as measures of exhaustion: “I felt that everything I did was an effort” and “I could not get going.",4747a281-0e7e-4178-a6b7-4167373497ff
12,methods3,"” Self-reported exhaustion was present if at least one condition was present for ≥3 days in the past week. Gait speed was measured by asking participants to walk at their usual speed over 4.5 m. Slow gait was defined as walking equal to or above the sex- and height-specific validated cut-offs . Physical activity was measured with the energy expenditure weekly rate (kcal/week) derived from the modified Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire, in which participants were asked on frequency and duration of time spent in 18 activities over the prior 2 weeks (Taylor, 1978; Siscovick et al., 1997). Low physical activity was defined as <383 kcal for men or <270 kcal for women, according to sex-specific cutoffs . The absence of any of the above criteria defines non-frailty status, while pre-frailty was defined as the presence of 1 or 2 of the above criteria.",0958e644-54d4-424e-b83f-8c5d5f8be7d1

27,discussion2,"The gradually declining efficiency of proteostasis during aging has been proposed as a major underpinning mechanism in common age-related human disorders (Morimoto and Cuervo, 2014; Chondrogianni et al., 2015b). Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies support a strong correlation between the maintenance of proteostasis and healthy aging. For instance, our previous work has indicated that centenarians have an unremitting expression of functional proteasome which may contribute to their successful aging . Accordingly, we have previously demonstrated that “proteasome activated” cell lines exhibit a significant delay of senescence , while a wide range of natural compounds, many of whom are commonly encountered in the Mediterranean diet, have been identified as enhancers of proteasome activity and retarders of aging (Chondrogianni et al., 2010; Kapeta et al., 2010; Papaevgeniou et al., 2016).",1fa95a57-321c-4e61-a38a-c4591b02114f

Fairly common conditions such as overnutrition can induce increased accumulation of neutral lipids and a series of cytotoxic effects associated with impaired redox homeostasis and apoptotic mechanisms. Short term low-fat dietary intervention along with moderate physical activity have been proved to ameliorate oxidative/antioxidative status, from the perspective of biochemical biomarkers examination pre/post intervention.",d2502fa0-37d9-47c9-91f6-5df90ed3e85f

All those data further support the protective role of certain antioxidants, nutrients, and natural compounds . In contrast, insufficient antioxidant protection can lead to oxidative stress induced damage, with an occurring enhanced formation of oxidative stress biomarkers , such as levels of carbonylated proteins. As shown recently, low intake of dietary antioxidants may result in modifications in lipoprotein oxidation and thus increase the risk of developing atherosclerotic plaques .",be445904-a8b3-4b9d-927a-651fff58436c
30,discussion5," Findings presented in this study highlight a significant negative correlation between levels of oxidized/carbonylated proteins and proper proteasomal function both before and after intervention.  Some of the major outcomes of this study refer to increased proteasome content levels, reported in distinct subgroups, such as the one consisting of subjects that retained their non-frail status throughout the intervention period and women. Regarding specifically the proteasome activity, women seem to receive greater benefit, as elevated levels were described in female subjects as well as in the subgroup of consistently non-frail subjects. This increase interestingly demonstrates similar trends with the overall compliance to MedDiet and the achievement of dietary goals.  In order to elucidate subjects’ inflammatory status, an additional biomarker, namely the immunoproteasome, was determined before and after the dietary intervention.",f6ec4d07-df8c-430c-98d5-c955c1cccf97

Specifically, elevated immunoproteasome levels have been reported in a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as ulcerative colitis , Crohn’s disease , inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel disease (IBD))  and hepatitis . These findings clearly support the involvement of the immunoproteasome in these inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and specifically, upregulation of the β1i and β5i subunits has been observed in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis .",8be0e708-0cfd-447e-b6af-a84d7b1a81f2
32,discussion7," However, the specific functions carried out by the immunoproteasome are not fully understood in aging and neurodegenerative diseases and the possible therapeutic implications require further exploration. In this study, negative correlation with oxidized/carbonylated proteins’ levels was demonstrated more prominently before the dietary intervention, along with relatively low levels of proteasome content, proposing that the immunoproteasome may compensate for impaired function of constitutive proteasomes . The produced data also imply that the immunoproteasome is largely involved in the aging process, remarking that β1i expression is related to an increased frailty status with subjects described as pre frail before intervention demonstrating higher β1i expression in comparison with non-frail subjects.",08f01de6-72a9-45b2-b47f-36d830701a12
33,discussion8," This trend was not observed after the intervention, where levels seem to be stabilized, suggesting a potentially beneficial effect of the “NU-AGE diet” on cellular immunophenotype. In support, in non- frail subjects after the intervention, a negative correlation was assessed between β1i expression levels and subjects’ compliance to MedDiet. Interestingly, lower levels of β1i before the intervention were also detected in subjects with lower BMI.  It is also worth mentioning that the examined biomarkers were additionally analyzed in association with qualitative variables related with subjects’ nutritional habits, their pharmacological profile along with levels of fatigue and sleep habits (one way AGE Database using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA); data non-shown). Some preliminary correlations were observed. For instance, proteasome levels were found significantly lower in obese subjects, while immunoproteasome levels correlate negatively.",7a795575-18b8-4bbc-a4b6-75c568b52345
34,discussion9," These data further support the notion that features such as high BMI associate with the aging process (Díaz-Ruiz et al., 2015). Overall, the observed trends provided some first insights about the beneficial effect of the used intervention.  Conclusion This study provides evidence that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may enhance proteasome and immunoproteasome activity and content in the elderly. Changes that occurred only in either of the subgroups suggest the existence of features, like genetic and epigenetic factors, that can influence the potency of dietary interventions and produce, thus, efficacy variations. Hence, the various proteasome complexes and their substrates, represent effective targets of intervention.
