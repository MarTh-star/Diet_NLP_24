0,methods0," This was a case-control study taken place in Southeast of Spain (Murcia Region) from September 2014 to May 2016. All participants were between 18 and 40 years old (n = 300). Exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactating, oncological treatment, hormonal medication during the three months prior to the study, genitourinary prolapse or endocrine disorders (n = 5). Methods were explained in previous works [35,36,37,38]. Figure 1 shows the number of participants and the exclusion criteria. Concisely, we finally enrolled, voluntarily, 126 cases of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and 159 women from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, outpatient clinics at the Virgen de la Arrixaca University Clinical Hospital. We excluded, because of the objective of this paper, five subjects who did not complete the questionnaire about food intake and four with an implausible total kcal per day.",f5926b69-27d8-4506-9b53-9ecccc081243

In a second phase, we carried out sensitivity tests excluding women:taking medication that interferes carbohydrate metabolism, not excluded previously (cases = 100; controls = 134)  taking multivitamins 10–12 months (cases = 98; controls = 131)  taking multivitamins 4–6 months or 10–12 months (cases = 90; controls = 123)  Diagnostic of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were established following the Rotterdam criteria resulting from the consensus of European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine [39]. Thus, Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was diagnosed with two or more of the following criteria:oligovulation/amenorrhea or anovulation (menstrual cycles > 35 days or amenorrhea > 3 months).  biochemical hyperandrogenism (total testosterone level ≥ 2.6 nmol or clinical (Ferriman-Galwey score ≥ 12) [40].",ac3c2204-9667-4e2e-a14a-df33e6c2a412

3,methods3,"  Controls were women without Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (or other major gynecological conditions) attending the gynecological outpatient clinic for routine gynecological examinations. The same methods were performed in both cases and controls: anamnesis and questionnaires, physical examination, transvaginal ultrasound and blood draw, between days 2–5 of the menstrual cycle. Written informed consent was obtained from all women. This study was approved by the Ethics Research Committee of the University of Murcia and the Clinical University Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca (no. 770/2013, approved 3 October 2013).  2.1. Dietary Assessment and Dietary Indices  We used a validated 117-food item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) to assess the regular food intake which was previously validated for the Spanish population [43,44].",c94078e1-328f-4b3e-a0c0-213c65813952
4,methods4," This questionnaire is based on a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used by Willett and collaborators in the Nurse Health Study Cohort [45]. Subjects had to choose one of the nine options about how often, on average, they had consumed each food ítem (from never or less than once a month, to six or more times a day). Nutrient values for each food were obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture and supplemented with Spanish sources [46,47].  The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) dietary information was used to calculate the following five a priori-defined dietary indices:alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)  alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010  rMED  aMED  Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH).  All these represent healthy dietary patterns but use different range of scores, variations in food components and calculations. They are described in detail in a previous publication [48].",1568c154-60de-4d19-bc1c-b0b4184dbd15
5,methods5," alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI), alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010 and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) were created in the United States to define a prudent dietary pattern high in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes and lower in saturated fats and alcohol [49,50,51]. The alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI) was developed by Teresa Fung and coworkers to quantify adherence to the US federal dietary guidance of 1992, with a higher score reflecting better quality and adherence. The scores range from 0 to 87.5. The score evaluates nine components such as trans fats, protein sources, polyunsaturated/monounsaturated ratio and cereal fiber. Table 1 describes the dietary indices in detail. alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010 is the alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)’s version for evaluating chronic diseases.",2ffdc8d3-8431-4041-8706-0404bb773131
6,methods6," alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI) and alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010 establish specific reference values of servings per day or grams per day for each food component and sum 10 if the subject reaches this amount. alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010 was designed in 2012 by Chiuve and colleagues based on updated literature to study the relation between food intake and chronic diseases. The alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010 scores 11 components for a total of 110 points, including whole grains intake (specific for women), legumes and nuts, red/processed meat ratio, sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juices, sodium and polyunsaturated fats [52]. The overall scoring range is 0 to 80 for alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI) and 0 to 110 for alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010.",ec89553f-0a09-4d4a-9028-89e37e9b41ca
7,methods7," However, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), rMED and aMED establish the scoring criteria using quintiles, terciles and the median intake of the study sample, respectively. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) was developed for controlling blood pressure [53] but, nowadays, is useful for obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is rich in fruit, vegetables and low-fat dairy products. rMED and aMED indices define the Mediterranean Diet and are versions of the original Mediterranean Diet score [54,55]. aMED considers red and processed meat and establishes the ratio of mono/polyunsaturated fats [49], while rMED evaluates dairy products, only uses olive oil as the primary fat source, evaluates in one item all types of meat and is more specific for the Spanish population [56]. The total score is 9 and 18, respectively.",400048aa-5c76-4df2-9bdd-0e88cca749e2
8,methods8," In all of these indices, higher intakes of healthy food items such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes add higher scores, whereas higher intake of trans fats, meat, saturated fats, sodium and alcohol are associated with lower scores.  Energy-adjusted intakes were computed using the residual method [57]. After dietary assessment, we excluded five subjects who did not complete the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and four did not have a plausible energy intake (≤500 or ≥4500 kcal) as shown in Figure 1. The study sample for statistical analyses was 276 women, being 121 cases and 155 controls.  2.2. Statistical Analyses  Data were checked for normal distributions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous data with skewed distribution were described with median and interquartile ranges (IQR: 25th–75th) and comparisons were performed by the Kruskal-Wallis tests.",d9fc665e-5f16-457c-9037-0d3079c6803a
9,methods9," We used the Chi-squared test for categorical variables and they were represented by frequency and percentage. The five dietary indices were recategorized in quartiles, the lowest quartile being the reference group.  We considered several variables as potential confounders and covariates (e.g., energy intake, nutrients intakes, physical activity, anthropometrics variables, age, gynaecological history). When inclusion of a potential covariate resulted in a change of the p-value corresponding to the dietary index variable less than 0.10, this covariate was kept in the final models. Hence, the covariates contained in the final models were total energy intake (kcal/day), body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) (Kg/m2), moderate-vigorous exercise (h/week), adjusted caffeine intake (mg/day) and adjusted carbohydrates intake (g/day).",110ed2f6-fa4d-43b0-b6c1-90ca2e8038db
10,methods10," We used logistic regression to analyse the association between dietary indices (quartiles) and presence of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as well as Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes.  Additionally, we carried out a sensitivity analysis for evaluating if there was influence of medication interfering in the carbohydrate metabolism in our results. Concretely, we excluded from the analyses fifteen women taking corticosteroids (prednisone, betamethasone and gentamicin, deflazacort, budesonide, methylprednisolone), fourteen women taking hormonal contraceptives (emergency contraception, ethinyl drospirenone-estradiol, medroxyprogesterone acetate) and eight women taking thyroid hormones (n = 32). The final sample size was 232 subjects, 104 Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) cases and 131 controls. In another sensitivity analysis we excluded women taking multivitamins and other s such us minerals, brewer’s yeast and probiotics.",bc7098c5-b78f-4f86-95cd-04e77dd5342e
11,methods11," The prevalence was 9% (n = 21; total = 234) if we considered the use of vitamins during 4–6 months or 10–12 months in the previous year to the subject’s recruitment, and 2.1% (n = 5; total = 234) if we only considered use of vitamins during 10–12 months.  p-values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed in IBM SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).  3. Results  The average age was 29.1 (SD: 5.7) years. Table 2 shows demographic characteristics, metabolic parameters, hormonals determinations and nutrient intake across quartiles of adherence to healthful dietary scores for the study sample. alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI), alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010, aMED indices presented a similar pattern. Women with higher adherence to any of these dietary scores had a higher age, physical activity and caffeine, carbohydrates and ω-3 fatty acids intake, but lower body mass index (BMI).",7c579209-657a-4dac-9cf4-20ee5e605bc1
12,methods12," There was an increase of total energy intake across quartiles for alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI), aMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores, a decrease for rMED and no differences for alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010. In addition, greater adherence to any of these scores was associated with less intake of saturated fatty acids, except for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. Differences between median value scores across quartiles of rMED scores were different compared to the other dietary indices. Lastly, women with greatest adherences to rMED presented lower total energy and ω-3 fatty acids intake and were less physically active (Table 2). Differences in demographic characteristics, metabolic parameters and hormonal determinations among Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) cases and controls have been published in a previous work [35].",296e5c56-3baf-4432-8820-218185683432
13,methods13,"  In the multivariable analysis, we did not find any associations between the diet scores and total Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), neither in ovulatory nor anovulatory Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Table 3). In the analyses by Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes, women with higher adherences to the alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010 pattern were less likely to present Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), specifically “H + O” phenotype (p-value for trend = 0.02) (Table 4). This association was mainly driven by vegetables food items of the alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010 index, being marginally significant (p-value for trend = 0.081). In contrast, we observed an inverse lineal trend between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index and “O + polycystic ovaries morphology (POM)” phenotype (p-value for trend = 0.05).  Results from the four sensitivity analyses showed similar findings to those already presented, not changing the observed results.  4.",efb89e43-ab3c-4b3a-9e78-b4a0985bc36e
14,methods14," Discussion  We found no clear associations between dietary indices and the presence of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or its phenotypes. Only suggestive associations between some a priori-defined dietary indices (alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010 and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) and some Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes (H + O and O + polycystic ovaries morphology (POM), respectively) were observed.  In detail, women with higher adherences to the alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010 score were less likely to present H + O Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotype. At this point in time, there are only two studies evaluating the association between alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI) and Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).",fcab141a-daba-4629-b8d0-f0a9d8f39f01
15,methods15," In the first study, no differences were detected in diet quality (using the Alternate Healthy Index-2015) or dietary intake between Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women and controls in a sample of women from New York (USA) [58]. However, in the second study, the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index was negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference among Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients [59].  We found that the Mediterranean diet was a protective factor only for the H + O phenotype. However, we must be cautious with this result since we did not consider subgrouping by Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes for the calculation of the study sample size. Thus, it is important to bear in mind this potential underpower. Nonetheless, we thought it was worthwhile exploring association among the diverse phenotypes of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) because diet may be more beneficial for women with a particular phenotype than for others.",d38fd614-1ace-42a8-a210-0515e7f0897b
16,methods16,"  One possibility which may explain this association is that women with the H + O phenotype presented higher prevalence of overweight and obesity (52.9%) compared to controls (33.1%) and other Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes (33.9%), but we need further studies with higher sample size. Indeed, nutritional randomized controlled trials in Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women have shown more effectiveness in reducing symptoms in women with overweight or obesity. Other reason could be that these randomized controlled trials, through diet, accomplished a reduction in hyperinsulinemia and, as a consequence, diminished hyperandrogenism. In previous studies, Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with hyperandrogenism increased around two folds (OR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.9–2.6) the incidence of metabolic syndrome and three times (OR = 3.1; 95%CI: 2.3–4.2) the incidence of insulin resistance compared to Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women without hyperandrogenism [60].",b9f92354-63eb-4a4a-8787-6764ae53286b
17,methods17,"  Regarding the findings of the alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010, this is the only one of the five indices which establishes the maximum score for whole grains at 75 g/day. This quantity much reduces glycemic load compared to the other indices. The other different item is sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice. alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010 scored 0 points if people drank one or more servings per day and the maximum score when subjects did not drink any sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score has an item for sweetened beverages as well, but it is based on quintiles intake. A subject drinking sweetened beverages would be more penalized in the alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010 than in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index. We also explored if a higher consumption of any single food group of alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010 index could explain the inverse association.",099dfe24-2b57-4105-8e4a-36be1b4bddcb
18,methods18," Only vegetables intake was close to statistical significance. Thus, the effect of the alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI)-2010 dietary pattern in the Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotype with hyperandrogenism and oligovulation may have a synergic effect of food groups and not be an isolated action of just one group. Moreover, compared to individual food items, dietary patterns measured a priori via dietary indices can incorporate complex interactions among foods/nutrients and can better reduce the risk of some diseases [61].  In our case, we did not find a clear explanation for the inverse relationship between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index and the O + polycystic ovaries morphology (POM) phenotype, but the relatively low number of subjects in this phenotype may play a role in it. Therefore, we cannot rule out a chance finding may occur.",b2787a9e-24da-4b6e-bdf5-7fdefedc0ed7
19,methods19,"  Unexpectedly, the highest quartile of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index was positively associated with the O + polycystic ovaries morphology (POM) phenotype, increasing the risk of having this phenotype with a higher Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) adherence. Contrarily, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may improve body mass index (BMI) and other metabolic parameters which could reduce Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) symptomatology. Three studies have shown that adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet between eight and 12 weeks among Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women could have beneficial effects on body mass index (BMI), androstenedione, anti-Müllerian hormone (anti Müllerian hormone (AMH)), insulin and lipid metabolism [31,32].",502bd274-8bf8-495f-bc5a-f0f3aec9709f
20,methods20," An interventional study with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet for eight weeks led to a significant reduction in serum insulin, triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and a significant increase in total antioxidant capacity, glutathione levels [34] and c-reactive protein [33]. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is characterized by consumption of seafood, poultry, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, which have been related to better fertility in women and better semen quality in men [62].  Another point to consider is the importance of fibre on Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) because of its capacity in acting on gut microbiota as a prebiotic. An increment of gut permeability, the reduction of biodiversity and a growing endotoxemia by lipopolysaccharide of gram negative bacteria promote higher absorption of energy, activate the immune system and inflammation, and increase hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance [63].",3f8316c9-48c9-4c3a-8119-fbfe0ca67832
21,methods21," The gut microbiota has been implicated to play a critical role in metabolic diseases such as Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and may modulate the secretion of mediators of the brain–gut axis [64]. However, the research is still in its early stage [65,66,67,68]. Fibre and microbiome may be a confounding factor in the present study. However, fibre did not accomplish statistical criteria for inclusion in our analyses, whereas carbohydrates did. Fibre and carbohydrates intakes presented a high colinearity, for including both.  On the other hand, our study subjects were incident and prevalent Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) cases. Therefore, some women could have recently changed their dietary patterns due to their symptoms. In fact, healthy dietary pattern adherence and physical exercise are the first line of treatment recommended for Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients [69,70,71,72,73].",c0a062ef-c69c-434e-a95f-65931cda5754
22,methods22," However, the monitoring of these changes in diet and physical activity is not integrated in the usual clinical practice [69,74]. Moreover, there are few studies that have explored diet changes after Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis, and their results are inconclusive [58,75,76,77,78].  Lastly, we have not found studies evaluating associations of diet among Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes. In fact, clinical manifestations of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are notably different among Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes, such as those presenting androgenism or not, although all of them take part of the same syndrome [79].  To our knowledge, our study is the first one analyzing dietary indices among different Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes according to the Rotterdam criteria, instead of other classifications such as anovulatory and ovulatory Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).",ce5f1c25-9656-4f84-97cd-6dca990de6c2
23,methods23," Our modest findings may reveal that it would be necessary to make dietary recommendations based on Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes according to physiological differences. Likewise, it has been reported that a phenotypic approach would be highly convenient for clinical practice and epidemiologic research [73,80].  Furthermore, the relation between diet and fertility in women has been studied in the last three decades [81]. Based on the Nurse Health Study cohort, a Fertility Diet was described, showing that its adherence was able to reduce the attributable risk of ovulatory disorder infertility in 66%of cases (95% CI: 29–86%) [82]. Relationships between alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) indices and Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have been evaluated, but mostly in randomized controlled trials seeking to improve Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) symptoms, mainly using low carbohydrate high proteins diets [83,84].",30b71768-d040-494d-9220-40423f4a561b
24,methods24," In women with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it would be worthwhile to carry out interventional studies with a mix approximation: firstly, to follow a high protein low carbohydrate diet, and secondly, a Mediterranean Diet. A high protein, low carbohydrate, diet may allow a quick reduction of body weight, hyperinsulinemia and inflammation. The Mediterranean Diet may be the second step for maintenance of the previous results with less secondary effects, and an increment of adherence to a long-term healthier diet. For example, the PREDIMED study was one of the most important nutritional interventions carried out in Spain. PREDIMED showed a 30% CVD risk reduction with the Mediterranean diet, which is of similar magnitude to that reported in statin trials [85].  The current study has some limitations.",8a25176a-40ed-43f3-816c-2db14aef52e6
25,methods25," First, we used a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) as dietary assessment method that has limitations but was comparable to other tools for assessment of food intake in nutritional epidemiology studies. In addition, all self-reported dietary intakes are subject to misreporting, with different types of foods likely to be either over or under-reported [86]. However, we used a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with a mean correlation coefficient for nutrient intakes equal to 0.40 for reproducibility and 0.47 for validity. Second, we applied dietary indices which were not specifically created for the Spanish population, except the rMED index that was implemented for the Spanish cohort of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)). This may limit external validity of this specific tool. However, all these dietary indices have already been used in multiple nutritional investigations worldwide.",3c583418-7c6c-4dec-b961-9566c958b45b
26,methods26," Third, case-control studies present a higher risk of selection and information bias than other study designs. Nevertheless, we selected both cases and controls from the same population of women who visited the same medical services in the same time period: a public hospital and outpatient clinics. Concerning information bias, if misclassification of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) status may have occurred, it would have contributed to underestimating the true magnitude of the relationship. Finally, we employed the Rotterdam criteria, which are widely used in gynecological studies and clinical practice.  In conclusion, we did not find any clear association between dietary indices (alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI), alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI) 2010, AMED, RMED and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)) and Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its phenotypes.",59c2b98f-76bd-4f9b-b6c9-370ad4d9bf7f
27,methods27," We only observed an inverse association between alternate Healthy Eating index (AHEI) -2010 score and less probabilities of the H + O phenotype, but this finding must be taken cautiously. To our knowledge, our study is the first evaluating the association between dietary indices and four different phenotypes of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), according to the Rotterdam criteria, and using Mediterranean Diet indices (aMED and rMED) to assess dietary patterns in women with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Further adequately powered studies are required to clarify if there are associations between dietary indices and Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes. In addition, prospective studies to monitor and evaluate the effect of changes in diet in Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women during regular clinical practice are necessary, which is one of the first treatment options for many women with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) according to the international practice guidelines.
