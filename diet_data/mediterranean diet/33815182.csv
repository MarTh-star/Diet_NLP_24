At baseline and at one year, we evaluated the creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eglomerular filtration rate (GFR)) and food-frequency questionnaires-derived dietary scores. Associations between four categories (decrease/maintenance and tertiles of increase) of each dietary pattern and changes in eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) (ml/min/1.73m2) or ≥ 10% eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline were assessed by fitting multivariable linear or logistic regression models, as appropriate.

However, changes in the adherence to the Trichopoulou-MedDiet and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Score were not associated with changes in eglomerular filtration rate (GFR), neither with a ≥ 10% eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline.

Our results regarding the pre-specified 17-item Med Diet score are in line with two prior randomized clinical trials, the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) in Spain [35] and the DIRECT [36] in Israel, in which MedDiet improved levels of eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) in participants with overweight/obesity, whereas the data-driven by the Trichopoulou score not.",6040d80e-37f2-4b3b-95b3-2e2e0c50d3be
17,discussion2," In the Lifelines cohort study conducted on apparently healthy middle-aged adults of Netherlands, an inverse association between the MedDiet adherence according to Trichopoulou and eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline was reported in men, but not in women [31]. Besides, in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men cohort (Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men cohort (ULSAM)), conducted in middle-age men, it was observed that a greater adherence to the MedDiet according Trichopoulou was significantly associated with lower odds of having Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) when it was estimated by cystatine C, but not by creatinine estimation [33]. In our study, the analysis was performed in the whole study population because we did not observe any interaction with sex.",3821ad1c-f48d-4d58-9b9b-efa4667ce1b2
18,discussion3," However, considering that previous evidence has reported significant associations in men but not in women, future studies stratifying by sex are needed to shed new light on whether the MedDiet could have a different role in kidney function in men than women. In the Northern Manhattan Study (Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS)), a prospective multiethnic cohort conducted in 3298 middle-age participants with no previous history of stroke, no significant association were observed across their four categories of Trichopoulou-MedDiet adherence and eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline, neither change in eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) [15]. The apparent disagreement between 17-MedDiet and Trichopoulou-MedDiet Scores in our study reveals the disparities between both tools concerning the items included. The inclusion of more food groups into the 17-MedDiet Score screener tool maybe would imply a more representative assessment of diet to observe changes in eglomerular filtration rate (GFR).",b25b53d5-bfe4-4a0e-95cd-1ce5e43a9d8d
19,discussion4," Additionally, scoring criteria are quite different; while the 17-item erMedDiet uses absolute values derived from a predefined questionnaire, the Trichopoulou-MedDiet score is assigned according to gender-specific medians of food group consumption of the study population [26]. The later may hinder comparability with other publications where particular cultural and dietary habits are present. Likewise, these issues may explain the controversial results observed between both MedDiet scoring methods in our sample. Of note, this is the first study so far analyzing the association between the adherence to the MedDiet, using the 17-MedDiet score screener tool, and renal function. Further studies, considering both scores (Trichopoulou-MedDiet and 17-item erMedDiet) are needed to clarify and strengthen our results.",b1319e15-4fdc-4c24-90d4-345722785de9
20,discussion5,"  Although the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been formerly associated with better kidney function outcomes such as rapid eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline [13] or Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) incidence [37], a recent meta-analysis did not confirm such associations [11], which is partly agreed with our findings. In fact, in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study [16], the authors not only reported a lack of association between this dietary pattern and eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline or incident Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) but also even greater risk of rapid kidney function decline among the group of middle-age individuals with hypertension after 5 years of follow-up.",3dbef27f-9163-4d3b-81d5-5513242b69be
21,discussion6," Whether a plant-based diet like the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH), which is apparently similar to the MedDiet, is not associated with a better kidney function, despite being protective against hypertension [38], which in turn is a well-known risk factor for kidney disease, needs to be further investigated.  The underlying biological mechanisms whereby changes toward a greater adherence to a plant-based diet as the MedDiet, but not the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, could preserve or improve kidney function are not entirely clear. When we analyzed individual components of the 17-item erMedDiet Score, vegetables, legumes, wine and the traditional Mediterranean tomato and olive oil sauce (sofrito) were associated with better renal function.",d85158d7-17ea-4553-9fa0-8323171714ee
22,discussion7," These foods represent the main differences between the two dietary aforementioned patterns and are rich in some beneficial nutrients such as fiber, antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds that may play a protective role by reducing the levels of inflammatory biomarkers, improving endothelial function, plasma lipid profiles and insulin resistance, lowering high blood pressure, and preserving a low glycemic index and load [6, 39–45].  Both Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH), which has been usually associated with better markers of kidney function, are rich in plant-protein. Despite some evidence has raised concerns about the detrimental effects of high-protein intake on kidney damage [46], it seems that besides the quantity, the source of protein intake might be considered when analyzing these associations. Likewise, its long-term effects in vulnerable elderly individuals are still unknown.",f163a529-25be-4921-9fa5-5217f14da16b
23,discussion8," Our results regarding the Protein Diet Score are not in line with those of a previous cross-sectional study based on three cohort [18], NQplus, Lifelines, and the Young Finns Study, where a positive association between the protein score and eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) was repy, by assuming that participants with renal dysfunction have already changed their protein intake [18]. Besides, our results from each component of the Protein Diet Score suggest that increased protein total intake could be the major drive for the deleterious renal association observed. Further research with long duration is warranted using this score to clarify its potential implication in kidney function and damage.  Limitations of the current study must be considered when interpreting the results. Firstly, eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement was estimated using SCr, as in most of epidemiologic studies, but other more optimal biomarkers exist.",ef5e4757-e35d-40a2-893a-04251b104523
24,discussion9," However, the procedures of those biomarkers are expensive, time consuming and difficult to be used in large population studies. Secondly, although the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) is an appropriate tool to assess usual dietary intake when it is carefully administered by trained staff, recall bias could not be ruled out. Thirdly, this study was conducted in elderly Mediterranean individuals with overweight/obesity and MetS; consequently, our findings cannot be extrapolated to other study populations. Fourthly, Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED)-Plus study is a randomized controlled trial; therefore, the lifestyle advice in turn could affect our findings. Nevertheless, we adjusted our analyses by the intervention group. Finally, SCr has a well-known biological variability and as we only measured it at baseline and 1 year (at short term), some degree of misclassification could be present.",ade9b9e8-552e-4dff-b8b9-cc95aba88595
25,discussion10," The present study also has notable strengths, which deserve to be mentioned, such as its prospective design, the relatively large sample size and the inclusion of different dietary patterns in main analyses. Moreover, we adjusted our models for a substantial number of covariates which could affect renal function, to try to control for potential bias. Even so, as in any observational study, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual or unmeasured confounding.  Conclusion  In summary, changes towards a greater adherence in the 17-item erMedDiet score after 1 year of follow-up were associated with better eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) and lower odds of ≥ 10% eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in an elderly population with MetS. Not significant results were observed with regards to the Trichopoulou-MedDiet and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Score.",8bf0c8be-1e5c-4916-bb0a-ddff4a8f4a0c
26,discussion11," These discrepancies could be partially explained by their differences in the calculation of the score, which in contrast to the 17-item erMedDiet depends on cut-off points based on the study population distribution of each item. Future studies in the renal function field should consider including the 17-item erMedDiet score in their analyses to clarify and strengthen our findings. Besides, the Protein Diet Score was associated with changes towards a worse eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) and higher odds of ≥ 10% eglomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline. Our results provide further insights to the evidence concerning a priori dietary patterns associated with kidney function in populations at high cardiovascular risk and reinforce the role of a plant-protein-based healthy diet in preserving renal function, particularly among this vulnerable population group.",f7d9fc67-03c8-45fb-8cd6-f62ab11921f1
27,discussion12," Therefore, improving dietary habits following a MedDiet could lead to a better kidney function, and even it could be considered an appropriate and safe preventive strategy against the onset or progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). However, these findings should be confirmed by future long-term studies and randomized controlled trials before including this kind of diet in the prevention and management guidelines of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
