0,methods0," Study design  The present cross-sectional survey was conducted online using a convenience sample. The purpose of the convenience sample was to permit immediate access to as many respondents as possible during the acute lockdown period of the pandemic. The survey simultaneously assessed the degree to which the current participant diet is similar to the MedDiet; the degree to which the MedDiet score was associated with anxiety; the degree to which the current diet was similar to the diet before the pandemic; and demographic characteristics.  Ethics  The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Board (Helsinki Committee) of Ariel University, Israel. Each participant provided informed consent prior to responding to the survey. Individuals who did not provide informed consent (indicated by clicking on the appropriate button) could not proceed with the survey.  Study location  The study was conducted online using a Google Survey platform.",d3481e1a-13fa-4471-a818-7a406ff00e2b
1,methods1," The survey was uploaded to several social media sites, including but not limited to the Ariel University Department of Nutrition FaceBook page; and the r/Coronavirus community on reddit, which created a page for pandemic-associated research; and individual social media pages. Participants were encouraged to re-post the survey link on their own social media in order to expand exposure.  Study population  The study population included all adult individuals who elected to complete the survey online and who provided informed consent by clicking on the appropriate button.  Inclusion criteria  All adult individuals (aged 18 or older) who saw and elected to respond to the survey were included in any of the study languages: Arabic, English, French, Hebrew, Italian, Spanish or Russian.  Exclusion criteria  Subjects who indicated that their age is younger than 18 years, and those who did not provide informed consent were excluded.",faabb3dc-4536-4b25-85b6-c4a80983728a
2,methods2,"  Study procedures  The survey was posted to public and personal social media pages. Individuals could respond after providing informed consent. Responses were automatically recorded in Google Survey.  Data acquisition and survey characteristics  The following data were elicited in the survey: (1) demographic information: age; sex; country of residence; education; work setting; current occupational status; current quarantine/isolation; and health status; (2) nutrition questionnaire; and (3) anxiety questionnaire. Data were anonymous, though respondents had the option of providing an e-mail address to which information about his/her MedDiet score was mailed. The survey was translated from its original Hebrew to the following languages: Arabic, English, French, Italian, Russian, and Spanish. Each translation was performed by a native speaker of the target language who was also fluent in Hebrew.",14de05e4-1805-4253-b9a8-ac2827170936
3,methods3," Once translated, the translation was back-translated to Hebrew by an individual bilingual in both the target language and Hebrew, thus validating the translation.  MedDiet score  Scores for evaluating the degree to which an individual diet is similar to the MedDiet have been developed [9, 17, 18]. Several shorter screeners have been validated as tools for rapid assessment of MedDiet adherence for risk assessment [9, 17, 19]. The Israeli Mediterranean diet screener (I-MEDAS) used in the current study was not intended to capture the dietary nuances of study participants, who were from six different continents; rather, the score was intended to approximate diet quality regardless of cultural framework. It was adapted from the original, 14-item questionnaire and modified to make it applicable also to the Israeli population [15].",005d3145-8c59-462e-b28a-382d85786585
4,methods4," The I-MEDAS is scored such that a given question receives a value of 1 if the criterion was met, and 0 if it was not, so the total I-MEDAS score can range from 0 to 17 points [15].  Anxiety score  The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was used to measure anxiety. The GAD-7 is a self-reported anxiety questionnaire validated for use in the general population, [20] and asks respondents to refer to the 2 weeks prior to the survey when responding to a set of statements. Each item on the scale can receive a score as follows: 0 (not at all), 1 (several days), 2 (more than half of the days) 3 (nearly every day); thus, the total score can receive value from 0 to 21, where a higher score indicates greater anxiety [21]. Cut-off scores for mild, moderate and severe anxiety symptoms are 5, 10 and 15, respectively [22]. The GAD-7 was already validated for use in the languages in which the present survey was conducted, so further translation was not necessary.",7ed8ca19-e8dc-4006-a263-ea9da4e92a4c

6,analysis0," Data were downloaded from Google Survey to Excel (Microsoft USA) and analyzed on SPSS v25 Statistical Analysis Software (IBM Inc.). Distributions of continuous variables were assessed for normality using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. All continuous data had distributions significantly deviating from normal, so are described as median (interquartile range). Nominal variables were presented as n (%). Associations between continuous variables were described by calculating the Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Continuous variables were compared by nominal variables using the Mann–Whitney U test or the Kruskal–Wallis test as appropriate. Associations between nominal variables were assessed using the chi-square test. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to compare those measures for which a value before vs. after the coronavirus pandemic were available.",411f542e-bfe9-4e33-a8f6-a7c07dc24347
7,analysis1," A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to identify the cut-point for moderate anxiety or greater (GAD-7 score ≥ 10) [21, 22] into which variables by which GAD-7 differed in univariate analysis were entered. The final model was arrived at using a backward stepwise approach with the likelihood ratio test, with an entry probability of 0.05 and a removal probability of 0.1. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each covariate, and a classification table was created. All analyses were two-sided and considered significant at p < 0.0001.  Sample size and study power  With 2144 anticipated responses, the study was powered to provide a 95% confidence level and a confidence limit of 2% for a GAD score of 10 or greater. The calculated sample size also provided 99% power to detect a true association between the GAD score and MedDiet score of r = 0.15 or greater, with alpha = 0.0001.

25,discussion0," The present study indicates that diet quality was inversely associated with moderate to severe anxiety during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, in our model, every one-point increase in the MedDiet score was associated with an almost 7% decrease in the odds of moderate to severe anxiety. More than 50% of study participants had a GAD-7 score consistent with at least mild anxiety. This rate is considerably higher than the prevalence of anxiety in the general population, which is estimated to be 1.9–5.1% [23]. However, it must be pointed out that our study population is a convenience sample, and thus it is conceivable that particularly anxious individuals chose to participate in the survey.  Increased MedDiet score was associated with reduced odds of moderate to severe anxiety, while a decline in diet quality during the outbreak compared to the pre-pandemic diet increased risk for this outcome, even after controlling for key explanatory variables.",0b1e16f7-e326-4f42-b5a6-633f45a4776a
26,discussion1," In univariate analysis, weight gain was associated with an increased median GAD-7 score. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain how diet may modulate anxiety. A high fat diet has been associated with increased corticosterone levels and increased levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines and disruption of intracellular cascades involved in synaptic plasticity [24]. A high refined carbohydrate diet has been shown to cause microglial cells to release pro-inflammatory cytokines, increasing nitric oxide production, which appears to promote anxiety in humans [25].  It has been shown that metabolic status (including obesity), age and sex influence the clinical severity of COVID-19 [26, 27]. This suggests that short, abrupt increases in energy intake coupled with reduced physical activity could produce adverse health consequences in a limited time frame.",6d01cb72-468b-4c1d-af9a-d46bd76c4c27
27,discussion2," Indeed, these acute changes have been associated with increased total body fat and particularly abdominal fat, possibly driven by insulin resistance and increased circulating inflammatory cytokines [28]. Thus, adequate control of metabolic disorders could be important to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19.  Uneven COVID-19 mortality rates across Europe may be partially explained by differences in nutrition. Specifically, diets high in antioxidants or anti-angiotensin convertin enzyme (angiotensin convertin enzyme (ACE)) activity such as uncooked or fermented cabbage, are more frequently consumed European countries with relatively low COVID-19 death rates [29].  Poor diet quality (which may foreshadow obesity) age and sex were associated with anxiety in the present study. Age reduced risk for moderate to severe anxiety in study participants.",23e2c690-d66d-408d-97ad-39d7ff4da4ad
28,discussion3," An inverse association between age and anxiety symptoms has been reported previously; specifically, the longitudinal trajectory of anxiety is downward from middle age through the 7th decade of life, with a modest rebound thereafter that tapers off [30]. Female sex was associated with increased anxiety, a finding consistent with prior reports. The increase in generalized anxiety in girls begins in mid-adolescence, and the lifetime prevalence of this condition in women is almost twice that of men [31].  A higher MedDiet score was also associated with less self-reported weight gain and an improved diet pattern during the pandemic. These findings may have implications for public health interventions. For example, online programs promoting adoption and/or maintenance of healthy lifestyle habits, particularly diet, coupled with stress reduction techniques, might benefit populations during any future pandemic.",325fe4ad-79b3-4f72-943e-a4f87e54aae7
29,discussion4,"  It is also interesting that the language in which the survey was completed influenced GAD-7 scores. Completing the survey in English was associated with increased risk for moderate-severe anxiety relative to Arabic, Hebrew, French, and Russian. Cultural differences in anxiety have been reported [32]. In the setting of the pandemic, differences could be due to cross-cultural differences, or they could be due to differences in the severity of the pandemic and/or public health messaging in locations where surveys were answered in English.  Findings herein must be considered in the framework of study limitations. The data are cross-sectional. Associations between diet quality and anxiety are correlational only. Further, many of the correlations were relatively weak though significant, likely due to large sample size.",74f064b6-593c-400b-9952-f39a0a5745f5
30,discussion5," Because the exposure (diet quality) and outcome (anxiety score) were measured simultaneously, the temporal order cannot be ascertained and, as such, causality cannot be inferred.  The present study nevertheless reports on a very large, multinational group of respondents during the rapid contagion period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study power was adequate to permit identification of population behaviors during a global pandemic and observes an inverse association between diet quality and anxiety level. Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine whether anxiety triggers unhealthy eating patterns, or unhealthy eating patterns reinforce anxiety. Perhaps the association is bi-directional.  This large, internationally distributed online survey conducted in a variety of widely-spoken languages detects associations between anxiety levels and dietary patterns, albeit in a self-selected sample.",1ac22eb8-32ef-4b11-971f-678a055f7923
