Patients underwent a complete clinical and biochemical diagnostic work-up including routine clinical and biochemical evaluations. Anthropometric data (i.e., waist circumference and body mass index, BMI) and information on concomitant treatment and co-morbidities were registered. High waist circumference was defined as >84 cm in females and >102 in males. Cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors were defined according to international guidelines.",0ba81fba-e137-4184-a4fb-02a3492dac11
2,methods2," Liver ultrasonography (US) scanning was performed to assess the presence of steatosis. Aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI)), a non-invasive marker of advanced fibrosis, was calculated and values of aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) > 0.7 were considered positive for predicting significant hepatic fibrosis [23,24].  Informed written consent was obtained, and the study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by the local ethical board of Sapienza-University of Rome (Ref. 2277 prot. 873/11).

Patients with the US signs of cirrhosis or portal hypertension (nodular liver, ascites, portal flow mean velocity < 14 cm/s, inversion of flow in the portal vein, portosystemic collaterals, portal vein diameter > 13 mm, and decreased or no respiratory variation in splenic and superior mesenteric vein diameter, portal/splenic/superior mesenteric vein thrombosis) were excluded [26,27].  2.2. Med-Diet Questionnaire Adherence to the Med-diet was investigated by a short, nine-item validated and previously described [28] dietary questionnaire, which was administered to each patient at study entry by a trained physician with a direct face-to-face interview, blinded to patients’ characteristics. The questionnaire includes the most important cardio-protective foods and has been shown to correlate inversely with cardiovascular risk both in general population and in patients at high cardiovascular risk [29,30].",ff708fed-b040-4a93-a93a-cc7551639cf5

The Med-Diet score resulting from the questionnaire ranges from 0 to 9 points. Patients with 7–9 points at questionnaire were defined as high adherent to Med-diet.  2.3. Serum sNox2-dp To quantify Nox2 activity, we measured serum levels of soluble sNox2-dp, a marker of Nox2 activation, by ELISA method as previously described [32].",6ab993e1-5272-477c-b4a7-4a9a3825a37d

Values were expressed as pg/mL; intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 5.2% and 6%, respectively. Due to the absence of a cut-off of sNox2-dp to identify impaired oxidative stress, we arbitrarily categorized sNox2-dp into tertiles as previously described [33].  2.4. Serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels were measured using a commercial ELISA kit (Cusabio). Standards of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), purified from Escherichia coli, and blood samples were plated for 2 h at room temperature onto a microplate pre-coated with the antibody specific for lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

We analyzed median differences of sNox2-dp and of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) between patients with and without liver steatosis.  Afterwards, we analyzed factors associated with impaired oxidative stress in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset and progression from simple steatosis (NAFL)D.

Mediterranean Diet When we analyzed the association between sNox2-dp and the individual Med-diet questionnaire items, at multivariable logistic regression analysis the daily consumption of wine (OR: 0.29, p = 0.046) and the intake of at least two fish servings per week (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.117–0.894, p = 0.030) inversely correlated with the top sNox2-dp tertile (Figure 2).  4. Discussion We found increased systemic oxidative stress in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset and progression from simple steatosis (NAFL)D patients as compared to patients without non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset and progression from simple steatosis (NAFL)D.",1fd2414a-8c89-4a72-ba2f-6f7dfb72d110
11,methods11," This result confirms our previous ones showing increased levels of urinary 8-iso-PGF2α and of serum sNox2-dp, together with lower serum vitamin E levels [34], in a large cohort of consecutive non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset and progression from simple steatosis (NAFL)D patients [5]. These findings are also in keeping with recent experimental data suggesting a key role for Nox proteins in the progression of hepatic fibrosis [35] and for Nox2 in the modulation of inflammation in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset and progression from simple steatosis (NAFL)D [36]. In addition, we found increased level of serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset and progression from simple steatosis (NAFL)D. To note, median serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in these patients were higher than those previously measured by ourselves in other clinical settings, such as pre-diabetes [37], atrial fibrillation [38] and cirrhosis [39].",a16401e2-f0f9-460c-a3da-625ca5c01084
12,methods12,"  In patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset and progression from simple steatosis (NAFL)D, high level of oxidative stress was independently associated with higher values of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a low adherence to Med-diet. However, from our data we cannot assess whether the increased intestinal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset and progression from simple steatosis (NAFL)D is due to a leak of the gut barrier, as we proved in other studies [16,37], or to other translocation mechanisms, as via lipid absorption [17].  Overall, these findings support the hypothesis of a possible role of diet and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as stimulus for oxidative stress activation in human non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset and progression from simple steatosis (NAFL)D.",f96fada0-df5f-4ced-a5f3-02298ee023db
13,methods13," The association between oxidative stress and Mediterranean diet was previously described in other settings, such as atrial fibrillation [29], and in Korean and Greek general population [40,41]. There are also some interventional data demonstrating the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reduction with a Med-diet enriched with different nutrients [42,43]. However, another possible mechanism accountable for the correlation between low adherence to Med-Diet and oxidative stress could be the previously reported strong association between poor adherence to this dietary model and insulin resistance in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset and progression from simple steatosis (NAFL)D patients [44]. However, in this study, we did not find any association between metabolic syndrome and oxidative stress [45].  In addition, our study demonstrated a strong association of oxidative stress with aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), a non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis.",098dd039-142c-4e6f-b76c-f1246f109373
14,methods14," This result agrees with our previous study demonstrating the association between systemic oxidative stress and some severity indices of fibrosis in liver biopsies of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset and progression from simple steatosis (NAFL)D patients [4].  When we analyzed individual food intakes, we found that fish and moderate wine consumption appeared to play a protective role against oxidative stress. The data on wine consumption is consistent with previous works showing a beneficial effect of wine-derived polyphenol, specially resveratrol, on the redox balance [46]. Most data on the association between fish consumption and oxidative stress are derived from studies testing the effect of fish oil as dietary supplementation. While there are wide evidences that the use of fish oil redistributes lipoprotein subclasses without increasing oxidative stress [47], the ability of fish oil to ameliorate redox status is still debated.",2f40750c-8192-4cdd-ba10-1215c4b3e0d2
15,methods15," Conversely, two randomized clinical trials demonstrated that fish oil was not effective in reducing oxidative stress in patients with atrial fibrillation [48] nor in healthy subjects [49]. Notably, in a non-controlled dietary trial, during weight loss, fish intake correlated with oxidative stress reduction better than fish oil supplementation [50]. Finally, despite the fact that the questionnaire we used was not designed to investigate single food intakes, our data show that the whole Mediterranean pattern has a higher effect on sNox2-dp levels compared to the separate effects of wine and fish intakes.  The study may have implications. Serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) may represent a novel pathway triggering oxidative stress in NASH. This could suggest dietary and/or therapeutic approaches aimed at reducing gut pathogenic bacterial translocation.",329711d3-b881-4862-9d50-19a11a294297
16,methods16," However, we believe that the study should be extended to the evaluation of the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on oxidative status as a whole and, above all, on antioxidant status.  The study has also some limitations. First, we detected fatty liver by ultrasound, which is a qualitative method inadequate to quantify less than 30% liver fat content. The gold standard for the diagnosis of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset and progression from simple steatosis (NAFL)D is liver biopsy, but this is an invasive procedure with potentially serious complications and is therefore not acceptable without clinical indication. Second, the study has been carried out in patients recruited in a Hospital-based setting and the protocol design did not contemplate healthy controls.  Finally, the observational design of the study does not make it possible to establish a cause–effect relationship.  5.",195acd43-1e04-4f81-8738-8a8beb35da03
17,methods17," Conclusions Overall, our results suggest that Med-Diet may be a beneficial nutritional approach in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) onset and progression from simple steatosis (NAFL)D patients to improve redox status, but interventional studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis.
