0,background0," Cardiovascular disease (Cardiovascular disease (CVD)) is a main cause of mortality and disability worldwide. One of the key factors in the soaring prevalence of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) globally has been nutrition transitions and changes in dietary patterns.  Objective  This study investigated the association between two diet scores, namely, a high-fat dietary (high fat dietary (HFD)) pattern score and a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) score, and Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (obesity, hypertension, total cholesterol, and blood glucose) and serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) levels.

1,methods0," Three hundred twenty-one participants were included in this study. Fasting blood tests were collected from all participants for biochemical measurements. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were also taken. A validated, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to collect data on participants’ dietary intake. Dietary scores for the high fat dietary (HFD) pattern were calculated based on recommended food groups. MedDiet scores were calculated based on a previously validated method that contains 14 questions related to MedDiet. Both diet scores were classified into tertiles. Linear regression analyses were performed to assess the statistical significance of the tertile groups.  Result  A significant association was found between high fat dietary (HFD) score and obesity when comparing the lowest tertile (27.3±4.6 kg/m2) of high fat dietary (HFD) scores with the medium tertile (29.2±5.7 kg/m2; P = 0.02).",4a6a747b-9c3b-42e6-9b76-7f8cc066929b
2,methods1," A higher high fat dietary (HFD) score was significantly associated with lower 25(OH)D levels (P = 0.02). In addition, a significant association was observed between MedDiet scores and 25(OH)D levels, with an increase in MedDiet score resulting in an increase in 25(OH)D levels (P = 0.01). Furthermore, a significant negative association between MedDiet scores and low-density lipoprotein levels was reported only in participants with Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (P = 0.03).  Conclusion  The results of this study revealed that high fat dietary (HFD) and MedDiet scores might have a role in the development of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and vitamin D deficiency among the Saudi Arabian population. Further studies are required using diet scores to assess the quality of dietary patterns and their association with an increased risk of diseases in Saudi Arabians.",557f3760-dd6a-4c07-a3aa-90b5870cc508

A significant inverse association between high-fat dietary (high fat dietary (HFD)) pattern scores and serum 25(OH)D levels was reported, whereas greater adherence to MedDiet was associated with higher serum 25(OH)D levels.  A significant positive association was found between high fat dietary (HFD) score and obesity.  A significant negative association was found between MedDiet score and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels in Cardiovascular disease (CVD) participants.  The major cause of morbidity and mortality globally is cardiovascular disease (Cardiovascular disease (CVD)), accounting for approximately 31% of all deaths (1).",be8b0f97-9a5d-4e89-935a-bebdbfe7f1d9
4,methods3," In Saudi Arabia, numerous studies have shown a high prevalence of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and associated risk factors (2–4). Unhealthy dietary patterns are the main risk factor for Cardiovascular disease (CVD), with almost 10,000,000 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths globally caused by dietary risk factors in 2017. The main dietary risk factors attributed to this number of deaths were a high sodium intake, low fruit intake, and low whole-grain intake (5). Evidence shows that reducing Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk depends on macronutrient replacement, that is, replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat. Randomized controlled trials have confirmed that replacing saturated fatty acids with unsaturated fatty acids reduces Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk compared with refined carbohydrates (6–8). In addition, higher adherence to a healthy dietary pattern significantly reduced Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by 0.",8f387dc5-3e27-4b82-a75e-661feebb6194
5,methods4,"78 in the general population, according to the findings of a meta-analysis based on longitudinal cohort studies (9).  Dietary pattern is the term used to describe a person’s food intake patterns over a period of time (10). Most nutrition research has examined a single nutrient or type of food in relation to a specific disease; however, the focus is currently on food-based approaches, such as dietary patterns. The study of dietary patterns is more effective because they mirror the real world, in which individuals consume entire meals and not isolated nutrients. Furthermore, eating behaviors cover a combination of various foods and a variety of nutrients that are more likely to interact with each other, and their shared effect may offer a comprehensive approach to preventing and treating numerous diseases (11, 12). One dietary pattern that has a favorable effect on the reduction of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet).",c073fb36-e422-42c6-a838-6a8939ef668c
6,methods5," The MedDiet is characterized by a high intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, seafood, and olive oil as sources of monounsaturated fatty acids, as well as low consumption of red meat and processed meat. Thus, the MedDiet is widely considered a healthy dietary pattern (13, 14). In a 10-year follow-up study, high adherence to the MedDiet, measured on a 10-point scale, caused a 0.85 and 0.88 reduction in Cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality, respectively (15). In the PREDIMED randomized primary prevention trial, adherence to the MedDiet plus extra-virgin olive oil and to the MedDiet plus nuts resulted in a reduction in atherosclerotic risk factors by 0.34 and 0.50, respectively, 4.8 years after follow-up (16).  A diet score is a tool used to assess the quality of a person’s dietary pattern according to recommendations or compliance with a defined dietary pattern. The score measures adherence to a combination of food groups and nutrient intake.",c8c58c72-8faa-4c47-979f-96b1cdc508e3
7,methods6," It has also been used to assess adherence to dietary recommendations or healthy dietary patterns such as MedDiet (17, 18). Several studies have used the diet scoring approach to examine adherence to specific dietary patterns, as well as whether they are associated with an increased risk of diseases such as Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (9, 19, 20).  Vitamin D deficiency is a serious problem in Saudi Arabia. National studies have reported serum 25(OH)D deficiency <50 mmol/L (<20 ng/mL) among various age groups in Saudi Arabia (21–23). In Saudi males, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency reached 40%, whereas it reached 60% in Saudi females (24). Numerous scientific studies have steadily revealed an association between serum 25(OH)D deficiency and an increased risk of chronic diseases such as Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (25, 26). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between dietary pattern scores and serum 25(OH)D levels in Saudi Arabia.",3701a0ff-6851-4a46-85b5-f15471e8940b
8,methods7," Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the association of two diet scores, high-fat dietary (high fat dietary (HFD)) pattern scores and MedDiet scores, and Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) levels in a sample of Saudi Arabian adults, which may benefit planning programs that aim to prevent and reduce the risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and vitamin D deficiency in Saudi Arabia.   Study population  The study design and population have been described in detail elsewhere (27). In brief, the study was conducted from May to October 2015 in the cities of Jeddah and Makkah, Saudi Arabia. The study sample included 325 participants (130 cases and 195 controls); however, only 321 participants completed the food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)).",e4598741-b7c6-4514-ad8c-b014eda1622f
9,methods8," Thus, 321 participants took part in this study: 129 participants with Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (cases) and 192 participants without Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (controls). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) participants were recruited from the cardiology department in King Abdullah Medical City. The control group participants were recruited from family medicine clinics and nose and throat clinics, as well as ophthalmology clinics at Tunsi Private Hospital and King Abdulaziz University Hospital. All participants included in this study were male and female adults, either Saudis or residents in Saudi Arabia for at least 5 years. Participants with health conditions that affect vitamin D metabolism (e.g., kidney and liver diseases, hyperparathyroidism, and osteoporosis) were excluded. Eligible participants signed written informed consent forms before participating in the study.

Data collection  Face-to-face interviewers were conducted with all participants to collect data regarding sociodemographic factors, including age, sex, marital status, level of education, and employment. In addition, data regarding family history of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the use of vitamin D dietary supplements were collected. Height, weight, and blood pressure measurements were made using the hospital’s standard equipment after conducting the interviews. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight (kilograms) divided by height (meters) squared. Obesity and overweight were defined according to the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) definition.",631e2ea3-34a8-42a9-b5f7-9e32b7390d4e
11,methods10," When the participants’ Body mass index (BMI) was ≥30 kg/m², they were considered obese, and when the participants’ Body mass index (BMI) was 25–29.9 kg/m², they were considered overweight (28). Hypertension was defined according to the WHO’s criteria as BP ≥140 mmHg for systolic blood pressure or ≥90 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure or both, as well as subjects on antihypertensive drugs (28). To measure total cholesterol, blood glucose, and serum levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin (25(OH)D), 10-mL blood samples were collected from all study participants through venipuncture. The serum samples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 15 min. Thereafter, the blood samples were separated and kept frozen at −80°C for additional analyses. Participants with Cardiovascular disease (CVD) had further blood tests, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL)), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL)), and triglycerides.",50ee3303-5673-46c8-a71f-1c2897b32097
12,methods11," Serum 25(OH)D levels were assessed using a chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay on the Architect system (Abbott). Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25(OH)D concentrations of less than 10 ng/mL (<24.9 nmol/L), whereas vitamin D insufficiency was defined as serum 25(OH)D concentrations of 10–19.9 ng/mL (24.9–49.6 nmol/L). Adequate vitamin D serum levels were defined as serum concentrations of 20 ng/mL and above (≥49.6 nmol/L) (28). High total cholesterol was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III as total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) cholesterol ≥160 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) cholesterol ˂40 mg/dL, and triglycerides ≥200 mg/dL or if the patients were on medications (28). Diabetes was defined according to the WHO’s criteria as fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL or as subjects being on medications for diabetes (28).",b1753e4d-b819-4e59-9547-d6bbe09eaf65
13,methods12," A validated, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to collect data on intake of foods associated with an increased or decreased risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (29). The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) collects information related to the frequency of the intake of food groups, including cheese, red meat, variety meats (e.g., liver or kidneys), fresh or canned fish, delicatessen meat (including sausage), salted pies, pizzas, rolls or commercial sandwiches, French fries, cakes and pastries, nuts, butter, olive oil, fruits, and vegetables (29).  high fat dietary (HFD) pattern questionnaire score  Dietary scores for high fat dietary (HFD) were calculated based on participants’ consumption of the recommended food groups. The frequency of consumption was scored on an ascending point scale, beginning with unhealthy items such as cheese, red meat, delicatessen meat (including sausage), pie and pizza, French fries, cakes, and butter at the bottom.",1887d4b3-78db-405a-9579-5a86941bb54b

Chi-square tests were used to examine differences between categorical variables. A normal distribution was tested for all continuous variables, and log-transformation data were used for the glucose value because it skewed normality. Participants’ responses to the high fat dietary (HFD) pattern and MedDiet questionnaires were classified into tertiles depending on their diet scores. Participants’ high fat dietary (HFD) scores ranged from 6 to 33 points; thus, groups were divided into low-risk (6–13, n = 81), medium-risk (14–18, n = 124), and high-risk (19–33, n = 116) groups based on the SPSS analysis of tertiles. MedDiet scores were divided into low adherence (0–3, n = 80), medium adherence (4–5, n = 149), and high adherence (6–9, n = 92), similar to a previous study (30).",74e966da-7ee7-498a-943d-ef9d00f9eced
16,analysis1," Linear regression analyses were performed to assess the statistical significance of the tertile groups.

Individuals in the medium-risk tertile had a 1.7 times higher risk of obesity than those in the low-risk tertile (Table 2). However, no significant differences existed between the low and high tertiles of high fat dietary (HFD) scores and obesity.

No significant associations between MedDiet score and obesity, total cholesterol, glucose levels, or blood pressure were observed. A protective effect was seen between MedDiet score and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels in participants with Cardiovascular disease (CVD) only (P = 0.03), suggesting that high or medium adherence to the MedDiet (2.5 ± 1.0 and 2.3 ± 0.8 mmol/L, respectively) was associated with a decreased level of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) compared to low adherence (3.2 ± 1.3 mmol/L) in participants with Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Fig. 3).",1cbfc400-c911-4e33-8b96-a56db5cf4421

23,discussion0," This study attempted to investigate whether high fat dietary (HFD) scores and MedDiet scores were associated with Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including serum glucose, obesity, total cholesterol, blood pressure, and serum 25(OH)D levels, among population of Saudi Arabia. Findings from this case-control study showed a significant positive association between high fat dietary (HFD) score and obesity when comparing the low-risk tertile of high fat dietary (HFD) scores with the medium-risk tertile but not for the high-risk tertile. In addition, the results indicated an inverse association between high fat dietary (HFD) score and serum 25(OH)D levels, whereas greater adherence to MedDiet was associated with higher serum 25(OH)D levels. In Cardiovascular disease (CVD) participants, adherence to MedDiet resulted in decreased low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels, which may suggest a protective effect of MedDiet among participants with Cardiovascular disease (CVD).",00e33868-da15-4b9f-bfc7-c6eae7b741a2
24,discussion1,"  A previous cross-sectional study conducted on children and adolescents (2–19 years) from the United States observed an association between dietary pattern scores and 25(OH)D levels (31). The study used two types of diet scoring. The first was a high-fat-low-vegetable dietary pattern based on the consumption of condiments, mixed dishes, snacks and sweets, refined grains, pizza, meats, processed meats, poultry, fish and other seafood, high-fat dairy, coffee or tea, and starchy vegetables. The second was a prudent dietary pattern based on the consumption of vegetable groups, fruits, mixed dishes, other fats, fish and other seafood, and meats. The study reported an association between both diet scores and the 25(OH)D concentration in the unadjusted model but not in the adjusted model. The results suggest that children and adolescents with high adherence to the high-fat-low-vegetable dietary pattern had lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations than those with low adherence (31).",dbfbf07a-4317-4830-81b3-aad99efc4c66
25,discussion2," However, this study examined different age groups and participants with different health statuses, as well as slightly different components of the dietary patterns included in the scores compared to this study.  Sunlight exposure is a well-known major source of serum 25(OH)D (32). However, studies have demonstrated that the consumption of certain vitamin D-rich foods, including oily fish and egg yolks, had a significant positive effect on serum 25(OH)D levels. In addition, exposure to sunlight can be influenced by many factors, including skin color, age, and the use of sunscreen (33). In addition, national studies conducted in Saudi Arabia have indicated that people have negative attitudes toward sun exposure. Individuals face several barriers to sun exposure, such as hot weather and wearing clothes covering most of the body (34).",8ed0aae0-f3b1-45b4-adde-e290eda078d1
26,discussion3," In fact, in this study, information regarding sun exposure time and the use of sunscreen was entered in the regression model as confounding factors to identify the association between dietary pattern scores and serum 25(OH)D levels. Hence, dietary patterns can be an essential contributor to serum 25(OH)D. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between dietary pattern scores and serum 25(OH)D levels among a Saudi Arabian population.  Regarding the association between high fat dietary (HFD) scores and obesity, two cross-sectional studies of Mexican adolescents and European adults confirmed that being in the highest tertile of a high-protein–high-fat pattern and a Western pattern was associated with a higher Body mass index (BMI) compared to the highest tertile of people following a prudent dietary pattern (35, 36). However, in this study, significance was only found between participants in the medium and low high fat dietary (HFD) tertiles.",caa70242-fee7-48a6-a535-8d2fe5ae5342
27,discussion4," The reason might be the small sample size and the sample’s health status, but it could also be that individuals at higher risk may be physically active or their consumption from energy was low.  Regarding the association between MedDiet and serum 25(OH)D levels, a cross-sectional study of 92 healthy obese children and children with metabolic syndrome from Croatia showed that adherence to MedDiet was not associated with 25(OH)D concentrations (37). Furthermore, evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in Mediterranean countries where the population highly adheres to MedDiet. Approximately 35–40% of the population in Croatia, Italy, and Spain had serum 25(OH)D concentrations mmol/L (<20 ng/mL) (38). In comparison, this study’s findings indicated that high or medium adherence to a MedDiet was associated with a high level of serum 25(OH)D compared to low adherence.",d5392b71-68a2-423b-98a8-0785378cbc59
28,discussion5," The difference in results might be due to the different cut-off values being used to define vitamin D deficiency worldwide.  Similar to our findings, a cross-sectional study conducted among 1,213 Flemish adults of both sexes reported that MedDiet score was negatively associated with low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels among male participants (30). Moreover, findings from a meta-analysis that included six intervention studies on MedDiet (with a total sample size of 3,227 participants) showed that dietary intervention with MedDiet resulted in a significant reduction in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels by −0.07 mmol/L (39). Nevertheless, another meta-analysis including six interventions does not observe a reduction in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) with the MedDiet; however, the MedDiet affected other Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors including Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, total cholesterol, and blood glucose (40).",ea788c16-d38d-4e2a-9869-bfe7876c0de6
29,discussion6," The abundance of unsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, and antioxidant content in the MedDiet may be a possible explanation for its protective effect against Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. These nutrients play different crucial roles, including reducing oxidative stress, promoting anti-inflammation, and improving parameters of endothelial function (41–43).  This study has some limitations. The study design is cross-sectional and cannot prove causality compared to a prospective design. Additionally, our sample size was relatively small. Self-reporting bias by participants is increased when using the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The study participants included controls and cases combined to form one group; however, the results were adjusted to include Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in all the analyses.",2a95aa18-4f8d-4011-88b7-26cc668554c0
30,discussion7," Lipid profiles, such as triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), were only available for the Cardiovascular disease (CVD) participants, which influenced the observed results. In the MedDiet score, some components of diet were missing in our food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), such as legume and tomato consumption (separate from the vegetable question). On the contrary, the main strength of this study is that two diet scores were used, and both showed associations with serum 25(OH)D levels in the Saudi Arabian population, making this the first study to examine this issue in Saudi Arabia.  Conclusions  In conclusion, the high fat dietary (HFD) score was significantly associated with obesity when comparing the lowest tertile with the medium tertile but not with the highest tertile.",39892014-ee07-4a1e-96e6-5e121ee29fcb
31,discussion8," In addition, a high high fat dietary (HFD) score was significantly associated with decreased serum 25(OH)D levels, while a high MedDiet score was significantly associated with increased serum 25(OH)D levels. In Cardiovascular disease (CVD) participants, greater adherence to the MedDiet was associated with decreased low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels as an indicator of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. These results suggest that compliance with a healthy dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, olive oil, and poultry and with reduced saturated fatty acids, red meat, and processed meat has beneficial effects on general health.
