0,methods0," Data were obtained from the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)) from 2007–2012 [22]. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is conducted in 2-year cycles, with data collection occurring during in-home interviews and in mobile examination centers. These analyses utilized sociodemographic, anthropometric, lifestyle behavior, biochemical, health status, and dietary intake (i.e., 24-h diet recall) data from three survey waves.  2.1. Subjects  Our original sample included 30,442 individuals from the 2007–2012 survey waves. Individuals were first excluded from this analysis if they were less than 20 or greater than 79 years old (n = 13,956).",081f7f6c-7414-445e-8754-c7f6c8dccc74
1,methods1," We then excluded individuals that were pregnant (n = 180), missing data on day 1 dietary intake (n = 1,446), missing depression survey items (n = 1070), or had an implausible energy intake data (n = 993) (<500 kcals or >3500 kcals for women and <800 kcals or >4200 kcals for men) [23]. Individuals were also excluded if they were missing data for our primary covariates of interest (described below) (n = 1028). Our analytic sample included 11,769 adults.  2.2. Independent Variable: Mediterranean Diet Adherence Score  Dietary intake was assessed via interviewer administered 24-h diet recall. One diet recall was obtained during the in-person assessment in the mobile examination center (day 1) and the second over the phone (day 2) within 10 days of the in-person assessment. For our primary analyses, we used the 24-h diet recall obtained during the in-person interview (day 1 recall), because in each 2-year cycle, approximately 20–30% of subjects fail to complete the day two diet recall [24].",3d9c26cd-b363-47d8-8c5d-7caccf01d36c
2,methods2,"  Adherence to a Med Diet was determined in two steps. First, the 24-h diet recall data was linked to the United States Department of Agriculture (United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)) Food Patterns Equivalents Databases to convert the foods and beverages to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) food patterns equivalents [25]. Second, a Med Diet score was calculated using the alternate Mediterranean Diet score (aMED) [26], modified for use with 24-h diet recall data by Gaskins and colleagues [27]. aMED includes nine components: vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, whole grains, red and processed meats, fish, alcohol, and the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fats. For purposes of these analyses, gender-specific median cut-points and aMED total and component scores were calculated [28].",0f997008-b456-4b0e-b131-fcc79b4a2adb
3,methods3," One point was awarded if the individual consumed above the sex-specific group median for vegetable, fruit, legumes, whole grain, nut, and fish intake and a monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio, and one point was awarded if an individual consumed at or below the sex-specific median intake for red and processed meats. For alcohol, 1 point was awarded for consumption of 5–25 g of ethanol per day for women, and 10–50 g of ethanol for men, indicating moderate intake, and 0 points were awarded for consumption outside of these ranges. The aMED score ranged from 0–9 points, with higher scores indicating greater adherence to a Med Diet. We then estimated quartiles (Q) of the aMED score, which served as our primary independent variable.  2.3.",c60f6141-242a-47cf-8c56-a85de6284827
4,methods4," Dependent Variable: Depression  Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [29], which is a nine-item screening instrument that probes for frequency of depressive symptoms experienced during the previous 2 weeks and is a reliable and valid measure of depression in adults [29,30]. For each of the nine questions, subjects responded using a four-point Likert scale, with response options ranging from not at all (0), several days (1), more than half the days (2), and nearly every day (3) (score range 0–27 points). Using the PHQ-9 scores, depression severity was dichotomized as no or mild (0–9) versus moderate or severe (10–27) using established cut-points [29].  2.4.",011f69b6-b8e8-42d8-842b-0b6c9da386f1
5,methods5," Covariates and Effect Modifiers  We used a directed acyclic graph to identify factors that might affect both diet quality and depression symptoms, including sociodemographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, relationship status, and family income to poverty ratio), total caloric intake and time of year of dietary recall (November–April or May–October). Additionally, we hypothesized the effect of aMED on depression might vary by gender, age, and/or body mass index (body mass index (BMI)).  2.5. Statistical Analysis  Descriptive statistics for continuous variables were estimated as the mean ± standard error. We calculated frequency and proportion for categorical variables. We also described nutrient intakes based on the one 24-h diet recall; we estimated the contribution of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins as the percent of total calories and other nutrients are presented per 1000 kcal consumed.",06907726-5ca0-4459-b007-78efb3167067
6,methods6," We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the odds of depression across the aMED quartiles when controlling the aforementioned covariates.  Additionally, we tested whether high (versus low) aMED scores, varied by gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) with the inclusion of an interaction term (e.g., high aMED X gender). Higher Med Diet adherence was defined as greater than the median total aMED score (i.e., 3). The interaction terms for age and body mass index (BMI) were statistically significant. Therefore, we also present results stratified by age categories (<30 years old, 30–55 years old, >55 years old) and body mass index (BMI) (normal weight, overweight defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 and body mass index (BMI) <30 kg/m2, and obesity defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2).  2.6.",57c23abc-faaf-4c73-96da-9cc8928638f0
7,methods7," Sensitivity Analyses  In sensitivity analyses, we additionally controlled for (1) health conditions (body mass index (BMI) and self-reported hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, liver diseases, cancers); (2) lifestyle behaviors (currently smoking, recent alcohol consumption, minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity over the past 30 days); (3) day of diet collection (e.g., Monday); and (4) systemic inflammation measured via C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)). Additionally, we utilize day two of the 24-h diet recall data. Utilizing two days of diet data, we estimate the effect of a Med Diet on depressive symptoms when (1) using the mean value for aMED components between day 1 and day 2; (2) estimating intake using the population ratio method (https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/hei/population-ratio-method.html (accessed on 3 November 2021)); and (3) estimating intake when using the bivariate method (https://epi.grants.cancer.",7ed59f47-7e80-4276-837b-69b97c3cac38
8,methods8,"gov/hei/bivariate-method.html (accessed on 3 November 2021)). The population ratio method estimates the ratios of the dietary constituents to 1000 kcal of energy, with the exception of fatty acids, which use the ratio of the sum of monounsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids and then each ratio is scored based on the median value as described above. The bivariate method uses adaptive Gaussian quadrature to predict usual intake for each individual and then employs the aforementioned scoring standards for each component (i.e., using the gender-specific group medians).  All statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA) and used survey design procedures to account for National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) sampling, stratification and clustering methods.",a86a4870-1506-4a49-9cb9-131d845765c9
9,methods9," Six-year sampling weights (2007–2008, 2009–2010, and 2011–2012) were calculated by multiplying the sample weight provided by National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for each 2-year cycle by one-third. Alpha was set to 0.05. The current analysis was deemed exempt from human subjects research regulatory requirements by the University of Illinois Chicago’s Institutional Review Board.  3. Results  3.1. Descriptive  Survey weighted descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. Aligned with the U.S. population in the years surveyed by design, about half of the sample was female (51.6%) and individuals were aged 46.2 years (standard error [SE] = 0.4), on average. Approximately 15% of the sample were lower-income, 56.3% were married and one-third had a college-level of education (30.0%). A majority of the sample (70.4%) was non-Hispanic White; 12.8% of the weighted sample were Hispanic, 10.7% were non-Hispanic Black, and 6.1% were individuals of another race/ethnicity.",374c6236-30df-4eb1-9fdd-cb41bfe8bf17
10,methods10,"  The average PHQ-9 score was 3.0 points (SE = 0.1) and 7.9% of the sample had moderate to severe depressive symptoms. One-third of adults surveyed had hypertension, nearly 40% had hypercholesterolemia and the average body mass index (BMI) was 28.9 kg/m2 (SE = 0.1). Smaller proportions of the sample had cardiovascular conditions (7.2%), type 2 diabetes (8.8%), liver conditions (3.1%) and cancer (8.8%).  Individuals with the highest aMED score (Q4) compared to the lowest (Q1) were somewhat older, less likely to be below the poverty threshold (6.9% of Q4 versus 20.0% of Q1) and had higher levels of educational attainment (54.7% of Q4 were college educated, compared to 18.2% of Q1). Persons in aMED Q4 also reported fewer depressive symptoms on the PHQ-9 (2.3 vs. 3.7 points) compared to those in Q1; PHQ-9 decreased with increasing aMED score. Those in aMED Q4 were also less likely to report moderate to severe depressive symptoms (4.0% vs. 11.2%), had lower body mass index (BMI)s (27.1 vs.",541ff709-8ea5-4974-b32b-001cc9206c9a
11,methods11," 29.7 kg/m2) and had lower C reactive protein (CRP) (0.2 vs. 0.3 mg/dL).  Food-based nutrient intakes are presented in Table 2. Persons in the highest aMED quartile (Q4) compared to the lowest (Q1), had higher intake of total calories (2198.2 versus 2029.6 kcal), but a lower percentage of calories from total fat (32.9% versus 34.0%) and saturated fat (8.8% versus 12.3%). Persons with the highest adherence had higher consumption of dietary fiber (11.9 versus. 5.6 gm per 1000 kcal), PUFAs (9.9 versus 8.4 gm per 1000 kcal) and most micronutrients, including folate, iron, and calcium.  3.2. Regression-Based Estimates  The adjusted association between aMED and depressive symptoms is detailed in Table 3. Compared to individuals in Q1, individuals with higher aMED scores had a 40% (Q3 odds ratio [OR] = 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.50, 0.74) to 45% (Q4 OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.84) lower odds of moderate to severe depressive symptoms.",7efc29e5-03a1-48ba-96a2-fc8712be6214
12,methods12,"  We observed some heterogeneity in the association by age and body mass index (BMI) (Table 4). We did not observe a significant association between aMED and depressive symptoms among individuals aged <30 years (OR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.60, 1.75). However, among individuals aged 30–55 years, higher versus lower aMED score was associated with 38% lower odds of moderate to severe depressive symptoms (OR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.80). Among individuals aged >55 years, higher aMED score was associated with 54% lower odds of moderate to severe depressive symptoms (OR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.64). Among normal weight individuals, higher (versus lower) aMED score was associated with 43% lower odds of moderate to severe depressive symptoms (OR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.86). Higher aMED score was associated with 34% (OR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.43, 1.00) and 29% (OR= 0.71; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.90) lower odds of moderate to severe depressive symptoms among individuals with overweight and obesity, respectively.  3.3.",7ffacf60-0e99-4001-9c53-e086be160431
13,methods13," Sensitivity Analyses  Our primary results among Q3 and Q4 were similar in magnitude and statistical significance when also controlling for health conditions (OR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.73), day of data collection (OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.84) and systematic inflammation (OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.90) (Table 3). However, results were attenuated and no longer significant among Q4 when controlling for lifestyle behaviors (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.45, 1.07).  Our primary results were also similar in magnitude and statistical significance when we included the second day of 24-h dietary intake and (1) used the average value between day 1 and day 2 (OR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.69) and (2) when estimating intake using the population ratio method (OR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.63) (Table 5). Results were not statistically significant when using the bivariate method to predict usual intake (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.27).  4.",9db71c8a-7a1c-404d-ac79-7341de3d69d4
14,methods14," Discussion  We evaluated the association between adherence to a Med Diet and depressive symptoms among a large representative sample of U.S. adults. In this sample, 8% of individuals endorsed moderate to severe depressive symptoms based on the PHQ-9. We found that greater adherence to a Med Diet was associated with 40–45% lower odds of moderate to severe depressive symptoms, which provides modest support for the diet’s role in mental health [18,31,32,33]. However, we observed an attenuation of the results among the most adherent (Q4) when adjusting for lifestyle behaviors (i.e., smoking status, recent alcohol use, and physical activity) as well as when using the bivariate method to predict usual dietary intake, which is a more conservative approach to estimating dietary intake.",e05107ab-229b-4abf-a3f6-eaf7bb9b2dbd
15,methods15," This suggests that the protective effect of a Med Diet on depressive symptoms may be driven by other healthful lifestyle behaviors associated with a healthful diet, such as decreased smoking rates and increased physical activity, as seen in other studies [34].  It is difficult to directly compare our study to others, as no other investigators have used aMED to examine associations with depressive symptoms. aMED uses a scoring approach driven by the median intake values of the analytical sample whereas a Med Diet scoring index like that developed by Panagiotakos et al. is based on pre-defined consumption patterns allowing for more direct comparison across studies [35]. Nevertheless, our results are generally consistent with prior studies. In the SUN cohort study, which used the original Med Diet score [36], the median score in the most adherent quantile was 6 points, the same score as our most adherent group (Q4).",e87471be-4112-4340-b022-1d4b9889b9fd
16,methods16," Among this cohort of 15,093 Spanish middle-aged educated adults free of depression at baseline, those with moderate to high adherence to a Med Diet had 25–30% lower risk of developing depression at 10-year follow-up [17]. In a cross-sectional analysis of U.S. men and women (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007–2010), high adherence to a “healthy” dietary pattern, similar to a Med Diet consisting of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, fish, nuts, and seeds, was associated with 23% reduced odds of depression in men, and 40% reduced odds in women, compared to their less “healthy” counterparts [37]. Similarly, a cross-sectional analysis of 8369 women participating in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Heath found that those adhering to a Med Diet, had 18% lower odds of depression, compared to those who did not follow a Med Diet [38].",f9683575-edac-44d9-949d-219412d48181
17,methods17," In the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED)) study, researchers found no effect of a Med Diet supplemented with tree nuts or olive oil on depression risk (compared to a low-fat control diet) at three-year follow-up [18]. However, the authors did find that in those with type 2 diabetes assigned to a Med Diet, there was a 41% lower risk of depression compared to low-fat controls. This suggests that those who might benefit most from a Med Diet are those with underlying metabolic dysfunction (i.e., insulin resistance) and a heightened inflammatory state, which are both hallmarks of type 2 diabetes, and known risk factors for depression [39,40,41].  In our study, we saw a stronger relationship between aMED and depressive symptoms with increasing age but not among individuals with obesity. Advanced age and obesity are positively related to insulin resistance and a heightened inflammatory state [42,43].",71e5134b-f8b4-41a5-8cf5-7abaa335bf4b
18,methods18," In line with the findings from Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED), our results for age show that with increasing age, the odds of having depressive symptoms when adhering to a Med Diet decreases. However, we did not see the same effect with increasing body mass index (BMI) category. This was a somewhat surprising result; however, among the individuals with obesity, overall Med Diet adherence was lower when compared to individuals with normal weight and overweight and this may have attenuated the strength of the relationship between Med Diet adherence and depressive symptoms. The finding that Med Diet adherence is lower among adults with obesity is in concordance with a recent paper examining Med Diet adherence among adults residing in the Middle East [44].  Within the existing observational studies and RCTs, biological mechanisms that mediate the association between Med Diet adherence and reduced depressive symptoms and depression risk have not been fully examined.",5283c033-e181-41e4-877f-022620a3d7fe
19,methods19," However, there are several plausible mechanisms including reduced inflammation and oxidative stress. Like the other non-interventional studies, we observed lower circulating C reactive protein (CRP), a pro-inflammatory biomarker, among those with greater Med Diet adherence [26,45,46,47,48]. The inflammation lowering effect of a Med Diet may positively influence mood by reducing oxidative damage products [49], increasing total antioxidant capacity and antioxidant levels [49], normalizing neurotransmitter production, HPA axis function and glucocorticoid receptor signaling [14,50,51,52,53,54] all of which are altered with depression [55,56,57]. Moreover, in our analysis, those closely adhering to a Med Diet had higher intakes of dietary fiber, PUFAs and vitamins and minerals from whole foods and beverages.",946a7ceb-257d-4e84-81e6-fd476e687d43
20,methods20," Fiber, a key component of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, may suppress inflammation through its effect on glucose metabolism [20] and its stimulation of the gut microbiota to promote their production of anti-inflammatory metabolites, including the short chain fatty acid butyrate [58]. Omega-3 PUFAs may lower inflammation and benefit mood by fostering the production of anti-inflammatory prostaglandin E3 versus pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2, lowering postprandial triglycerides, increasing chylomicron triglyceride clearance, and reducing oxidation of lipids [59,60,61]. Vitamins C and E, prominent in a Med Diet, also have antioxidant properties that lower oxidative stress and inflammation [62]. Therefore, the Med Diet’s anti-inflammatory and mood-related benefits may be attributed to the synergy of nutrients that comprise the dietary pattern.  This study has several limitations.",e2f08202-c4c2-4403-96e5-1f0c8e6eb02d
21,methods21," First, due to the cross-sectional design, we were unable to espouse a causal relationship between Med Diet adherence and depressive symptoms, and there is the possibility for residual confounding by factors unobserved in our data. However, we used a large, nationally representative sample, making our results more generalizable compared to smaller studies conducted in singular geographic locations. Second, diet data were calculated from 24-h diet recalls, and it is known that self-report dietary data are associated with underreporting and misreporting given that they rely on memory and estimation of food quantities by the participant [63]. Third, although National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is designed so that a single 24-h recall can be used to estimate the mean consumption of a population, using only a single 24-h recall in our primary analysis may not best capture usual intake.",b4877d07-99d4-4cd8-b4e4-b0eb7e1aced6
22,methods22," Fourth, prescription drugs, current use of psychotherapy and dietary supplement use was not included in these analyses and are exposures that could have differential effects on reporting of depressive symptoms and eating behavior. Finally, although the aMED score used to measure Med Diet adherence is widely used in the nutritional epidemiologic literature, it is a score based on the median intake values of the population being studied; this makes comparison to other populations difficult and may not be the most accurate reflection of adherence to a Med Diet.  5. Conclusions  Greater adherence to a Med Diet was associated with lower moderate to severe depressive symptoms in a representative sample of U.S. adults. Thus, we provide modest evidence suggesting that a Med Diet may support the prevention and treatment of depression in adults.",a51a179b-eb0d-4836-92fe-b9e7020251b7
23,methods23," Future directions should include controlled dietary intervention studies in diverse adult populations designed to examine the effect of a Med Diet on depressive symptoms and depression. These studies should also incorporate the assessment of potential biological mediators including inflammation, HPA axis function, oxidative stress, and the gut microbiome to elucidate mechanisms through which a Med Diet affects mood.
