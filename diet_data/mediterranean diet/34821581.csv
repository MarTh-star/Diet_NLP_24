0,background0," High caloric diet and lack of physical activity are considered main causes of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and a change in the diet is still the only effective treatment of this disease. However, molecular mechanism of the effectiveness of diet change in treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is poorly understood. We aimed to assess the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression regulation in treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Eighteen participants with medium- to high-grade steatosis were recruited and trained to follow the Mediterranean diet modified to include fibre supplements. At three timepoints (baseline, after 30 and 60 days), we evaluated adherence to the diet and measured a number of physiological parameters such as anthropometry, blood and stool biochemistry, liver steatosis and stiffness. We also collected whole blood samples for genome-wide methylation profiling and histone acetylation assessment. ",1cfe25d8-5a0a-4947-9bef-cf0a52608917

After inclusion, participants undergone three rounds of clinical assessments at day 0 (baseline/first timepoint), after 30 days (second timepoint) and 60 days (third timepoint). At each timepoint, specific clinical parameters were recorded and clinical material was collected as illustrated in Fig. 6. Overall, the group of 18 eligible participants that included Caucasian men (n = 8) and women (n = 10) with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were recruited following the criteria: FibroScan® (CAP ≥ 234 dB/m), age > 18 years old and no diagnosis of inflammatory gut disease.",b6ec1ab3-4499-443a-b219-32ba7b943f41

4,methods3," 6 Study design and outline of analyses performed at each timepoint  Guidelines and control of diet adherence  Each participant was then individually instructed by licensed nutritionist about principles of the Mediterranean diet and received pamphlet with detailed dietary recommendations to follow (Additional file 1: Methods 6 and Fig. S5). Additionally, participants were requested to eat two specifically formulated high-fibre rolls (buns) on each day during the study (Additional file 1: Methods 7). Twenty-four-hour food diaries were used to control participants adherence to diet (detailed description in Additional file 1: Methods 8). The changes in diet between timepoints were evaluated using Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (MDQI) scale [43]. Moreover, the participants were instructed not to exceed moderate activity (cardio training 5x/week every day, resistance training > 2x/week; no more than 150–300 min/week).",6171e299-ba7b-4bba-aa35-fcfd72e017cc

The measurements included: height (m), body weight (kg) and body composition including: fat mass (%), muscle mass (kg) and total body water (%), which was assessed with the multifrequency bioimpedance meter, Tanita BC-601 (Japan).  Liver stiffness and steatosis measurements  Liver stiffness (VCTE) and steatosis (CAP) were measured with FibroScan® at baseline and at third timepoint by the same trained in technology MD (detailed description in Additional file 1: Methods 9).  Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analysis  Gas chromatography analyses of SCFAs in stool were performed according to procedure described in Additional file 1: Methods 10 and analyses of SCFAs in plasma were performed using Waters Acquity Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography and Waters TQ-S triple quadrupole mass spectrometer as described in Additional file 1: Methods 11.",b46913b5-56bf-4bb0-ae10-8b7f76320c8f

DNA extraction for methylation analysis  The DNA from the blood samples at the first timepoint was extracted using Invisorb® Spin Blood Mini Kit (Stratec Biomedical AG, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions and salting out method from the second and third timepoints.  Genome-wide methylation analysis  The genome-wide methylation changes screening in DNA extracted from whole blood was performed using Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC, Illumina Inc.).

This data processing resulted in 666,589 informative CpGs available for all the participants at each timepoint of the study.",0906b2f0-cf1a-4730-8327-d0fab8fa8e17
7,methods6," Considering the data structure, we developed a specific data processing approach to identify the loci, at which methylation was most affected by the intervention (detailed description in Additional file 1: Methods 1). Briefly, the ∆β representing difference in methylation before and after the intervention was generated by subtracting β value for each CpG site at the first timepoint from averaged β value from the second and third timepoints, for each patient separately. Then, to take into account heterogeneity of the methylation profiles observed at the first timepoint we only included in further analyses CpGs that displayed 10% difference in methylation for more than 3/4 (77%) of the participants. Overall, this procedure resulted in 11,627 CpGs displaying differential methylation before and after intervention.",36e0807a-c20c-4306-a0ce-d535a88c7053

Gene ontology term enrichment and fold change analyses  We performed gene set enrichment analysis using “GENE2FUNC” function in FUMA [46] to establish which biological pathways may be affected by the identified methylation changes. We also used HOMER v4.11 for motif discovery analysis [47] and ChIP-Atlas to predict multiple histone modifications at the loci where we identified methylation changes. To investigate whether identified methylation changes occupy specific genomic regions, we analysed the distribution of those loci relative to the CpG islands, gene regions feature category (according to the Infinium MethylationEPIC v1.0 B4 Manifest File, UCSC coordinates) and regulatory regions as defined in Ensembl [48].

If the data did not meet the conditions for parametric test, then the Friedman test was used. For the parameters with significant associations, the post hoc paired t test or Wilcoxon test was performed. For the comparison of the parameters between two timepoints, we used paired t test or Wilcoxon test. Independent t test or Mann–Whitney tests were used for comparison of parameters from each of the timepoints to healthy controls and Pearson test to calculate the correlation between median methylation levels and clinical parameters.

After 30 days (second timepoint), the index reached a median value of 7 indicating a significant improvement in the diet and at 60 days (third timepoint) the median index reached 8, which reflects close to ideal compliance with the Mediterranean diet (p value < 0.05) (Table 1 part A). Apart from the improvement in the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (MDQI), analysis of the components of the patients' diet showed that participants reduced the total daily fat as well as the total intake of carbohydrates and cholesterol (p value < 0.05) (Table 1 part B), increased the consumption of fibre (p value < 0.",49916644-38c0-4b09-a9ed-bc09156bb9a1

However, the decrease was rather minor and the change in other parameters did not reach statistical significance (Table 1 part C). Furthermore, we observed an improvement in the key biochemical parameters (Table 1 part D) including GGTP, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (p value < 0.05). We also analysed the concentration of SCFAs in stool and blood of study participants.

14,results8," Although concentration of all analysed SCFAs in stool increased, the increase reached statistical significance for only acetic acid and butyric acid (p value < 0.05) (Table 1 part E). The SCFAs levels in plasma generally decreased during the study, and the changes in levels of three of them, including 2-methylbutyric, valeric and isocaproic acids, were statistically significant (p value < 0.05) (Table 1 part F). But there was no statistically significant correlation between levels of SCFAs (measured in blood or stool) and hepatic steatosis status. The most interesting observation in this part of the study was the statistically significant decrease in liver steatosis (Table 1 part G) from a baseline of 310 dB/m, characteristic for medium- to high-grade steatosis to 279.5 dB/m at the third timepoint (p value < 0.05).

15,results9,"  Change in the dietary habits appears to reduce acetylation levels of lymphocytes and monocytes  With the indication that the intervention in our study not only improved the anthropometric, biochemical and liver steatosis status, we investigated the relative change in the histone acetylation of the lymphocytes and monocytes. This change would suggest a potential effect of intervention on epigenome. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stained with antibodies specific to acetylated histone H3, and we used the flow cytometry to measure the fluorescence intensity of stained lymphocytes and monocytes. The change in the fluorescence levels for lymphocytes was statistically significant between the first and both the second and the third timepoints (p value < 0.05) (Fig. 1A). For monocytes, we observed a statistically significant decrease between the first and the third timepoints (p value < 0.05) (Fig. 1B).",f3930306-3238-4a85-b676-89d9d7732455

Additionally, we used methylation profiles of blood from healthy controls as a reference in that comparison. Already initial principal component analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) based on combined methylation changes at 666,589 informative CpGs obtained for each of the participants in the study showed that methylation profiles from the second and third study timepoints were very similar and grouped together (green and orange colours for second and third timepoints in Fig. 2A, respectively).",5b649b6c-c657-485d-b2f7-b7db83bb847a

Also in this analysis, the most pronounced change in the median global methylation was between the first and second/third timepoints (Fig. 2B), whereas the median global methylation levels at the second and the third timepoints were intermediate between the first timepoint and the healthy blood.Fig. 2 Analyses of global methylation changes between study timepoints.",d41afad3-358f-4c05-add9-a83423519c85

Diet change affects methylation levels only at a specific subset of CpG sites  Then, to identify CpG sites most affected by the diet change, we compared the methylation levels at each of the informative CpGs, between the first and the average methylation level at the second and third study timepoints. The detailed description of the analysis is in Additional file 1: Methods 1, and for the result of validation of this method see Additional file 1: Fig. S2.

Interestingly, observed methylation changes were larger than median global methylation changes, indicating that these CpG sites were indeed most affected by the diet change. Also, the variance of the methylation levels at these CpG sites was statistically significantly higher at the first timepoint (var = 0.0058) than at all other timepoints and healthy blood (second timepoint var = 0.0002, third timepoint var = 0.00036 and healthy blood var = 0.00005; p value < 0.05).",fe0781f2-1fc3-4bee-90e2-33cb7da029e0

The first component in this principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 3B) explained more than 83% of the variance confirming that the global methylation changes that we observed in previous analysis were mainly driven by the methylation changes at this subset of CpG sites.

The identified CpG sites also did not localize to specific chromosomes and were not significantly enriched in histone binding sites (Additional file 1: Table S3) and in specific transcription factor bounding sites (Additional file 1: Table S4).  Functional annotation of the diet-related methylation changes  The previous analysis indicated that the majority of the identified 11,627 CpG sites displaying methylation changes in our study despite that they mapped to 9956 genes (listed in Additional file 2) were not located in the regions traditionally associated with gene expression regulation (e.g. promoters).",9f1770d2-c7e3-49e4-9a1b-228bc159ffb2
26,results20," Recently, however, the regulatory function of the methylation changes outside of traditional regulatory regions is reported in increasing number of publications [28–30]. Therefore, we mapped the identified CpGs to the gene regions and used FUMA pipeline for functional mapping and annotation of obtained gene set [31]. This analysis showed that liver was one of four tissue types where identified genes were shown to undergo downregulation. Other tissue types identified in this analysis were “Kidney_Cortex”, “Artery_Tibial” and “Nerve_Tibial”. Interestingly, we were able to find publications linking all of those tissues types to non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Additional file 1: Table S5A).",960fcef7-7e6e-4397-8832-26243f35fdc0

28,results22,"  Methylation changes observed in blood separate liver biopsies from non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients according to the fibrosis grade  As already mentioned, the major limitation of studies like ours is the inability to obtain liver tissue from the participants, which would allow identification of the methylation changes directly implicated in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is, however, evidence that at least to some extent the methylation changes observed in blood cells can be considered a proxy of changes observed in effector tissue [20–22, 24]. In recently published paper, the association of the methylation changes in liver with the fibrosis progression was investigated [32]. We used data from this study that included methylation profiles of the 341 liver biopsies to validate to what extent observed in blood cells methylation changes reflect the methylation aberrations in liver cells of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients.",23f927a7-e112-462d-bc14-8785b923dee6

This analysis showed that the methylation levels at those CpGs were very similar between healthy blood (Fig. 5A—red colour) and liver (Fig. 5A—brown colour) but significantly different from blood of our participants before diet change (Fig. 5A—blue colour). At the same time, the methylation levels at the second and the third timepoint of our study (Fig. 5A—green and orange colours) were very similar (clustered together) to healthy blood.

32,results26," At the same time, those CpG sites display specific methylation changes in biopsies with grade 3 fibrosis (pink colour) (Fig. 5—Box 2, Fig. 5B, C).

We also compared the methylation levels at these CpG sites in blood between timepoints of our study (Fig. 5A—Box 3, Fig. 5D, E). This analysis again showed that methylation of this subset of CpG sites was also altered by the diet change in blood cells and can be a potential biomarker of the fibrosis progression. However, as our study did not include analysis of the methylation of blood from patients with grade 0 and 3 + fibrosis, this needs further investigation. ",f6434cf6-343d-4c06-9213-da765946ea65

Moreover, recently patients with NASH have been shown to exhibit epigenetic age acceleration measured by methylation changes in blood [35].  We studied genome-wide methylation changes in blood from individuals with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) who changed the dietary habits and followed Mediterranean diet for 60 days that resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the liver function measured by liver steatosis.

34,discussion1," This indicates a pronounced effect of the dietary intervention on the blood cells’ methylome of individuals with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The most interesting, however, was finding that the identified methylation changes did not include gene regulatory regions such as transcription start sites (transcription start sites (TSS)) but span gene body, exon boundary and 3’UTR. The presence of methylation in gene body has been shown to increase the fidelity and efficiency of gene transcription by confining the transcription to the canonical promoters [36, 37]. Moreover, it has been shown in cancer that intragenic methylation can alter expression of at least some genes [38].",60e2f200-912e-49ea-9e0c-3b6ebcd78c60
35,discussion2," Our results therefore suggest that the change in the diet in our study may have improved gene transcription; more importantly, gene set enrichment analysis confirmed the involvement of the genes annotated to the identified methylation changes in the physiology of the non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and we were able to find literature references associating more than 70% of the ontology terms from these analyses with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  One drawback of studies similar to ours is the inability to obtain liver tissue from the participants due to the risks related to the liver biopsy procedure. We have, however, been able to analyse the methylation at the identified subset of CpG sites in liver biopsies from previous study. This analysis showed that to a large extent the methylation changes in blood reflect methylation changes in the liver of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients.",ac2742f1-0c06-4da0-8a14-047868a5e235
36,discussion3," Moreover, we have shown that we are able to, with remarkable accuracy, classify the grade of liver fibrosis in biopsies on the bases of the methylation changes at the CpG sites that we identify to undergo diet-related methylation changes in blood. That shows that at least to some extent we can consider methylation changes in blood, a proxy of the changes that occur in liver.  The results of the methylation profiling in our study are in line with the results of absolute measurements of histone acetylation in lymphocytes and monocytes of our study participants, where we observed a decrease in the relative acetylation. As already mentioned, DNA methylation and acetylation interplay in gene transcription regulation and deacetylation of histone H3 on lysines 9 and 14 has long been associated with actively transcribed loci [25, 26] and inversely correlated with the DNA methylation [27].",6847330b-f4af-4530-b723-b6cc2dd71b9e
37,discussion4,"  The specific molecular mechanisms by which diet influences methylation and acetylation of the tissues are not known, and the results of our study only identify a pronounced effect of diet on those processes in blood cells. Undoubtedly, the level of supplementation of the donors necessary in both histone acetylation and DNA methylation in the diet will have an impact on the metabolism of those two processes. The animal studies have repeatedly shown that supplementation or reduction in dietary methyl donors modifies DNA methylation levels in liver cells as well as results in liver fat changes [39, 40]. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to elucidate molecular mechanisms of interaction between diet and epigenome of specific tissues.  One intriguing finding in our study is the observed increase in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in stools of participants after diet change.",bef97c0a-4f79-4784-b161-06fff29ba974
38,discussion5," The primary source of the SCFAs is gut microbiome [41] that suggests that the diet in our study affected and improved the gut microbiome of the participants. Moreover, SCFAs have been shown to affect the activity of histone acetylase and histone deacetylase enzymes that would provide an elegant mechanism for the interaction, but this hypothesis needs further investigation.  One limitation of our study is lack of healthy controls following Mediterranean diet, and we only compare methylomes of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients before and after intervention to the controls for which we were not able to access the dietary information. In the following study, adequate controls group should be used; nevertheless, the compression that we were able to make clearly indicates the effects of the intervention.",394e3eda-f006-45d7-acf9-dc950b4207fa
39,discussion6,"  Conclusions  In conclusion, our results clearly indicate a pronounced effect of the diet on the epigenetic mechanism of gene expression regulation and link those changes to the aetiology of the non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). ",8408a399-9637-45c0-a543-9bc46a252131
