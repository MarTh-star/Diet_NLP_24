0,introduction0," Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may present as a spectrum of disease from asymptomatic steatosis with or without elevated aminotransferases to cirrhosis with complications of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma [1].  The interaction between genetic background and environmental factors plays an important component in the pathogenesis of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [2]. With regard to the genetic factors involved, a single-nucleotide polymorphism occurring in the sequence of the human patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 gene (PNPLA3), known as I148M variant, is one of the most investigated variants as it is associated with increased of developing hepatic steatosis and progressing to advanced fibrosis [3].  Specifically, the rs738409 C > G variant of PNPLA3 gene and its encoded protein adiponutrin have been associated with a variety of roles, ranging from an acquired lipogenic function to a loss of lipolytic activities [4].",0b57b809-5b98-46e2-a008-168d854e90e4
1,introduction1," Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with obesity, and due to the increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome among young age groups, Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is to affect a substantial proportion of our population [5].  The high prevalence of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its low risk of progression to steatohepatitis make a large-scale screening strategy for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) unfitting for the general population [6]. Thus, focusing our screening on individuals at higher risk of progressing to more advanced liver disease is more cost-effective. Patients with prediabetes fall in this category as they are not only at high risk of developing Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [7], but also show a higher rate of progression to significant hepatic fibrosis relative to other patients with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [8].",72f0e687-484b-453b-abbb-145e21733d62
2,introduction2," Furthermore, as the prevalence of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in prediabetic patients remains uncertain and effective screening strategies in this patient population are lacking, we observe a higher frequency of non-referrals, especially when transaminases are deceivingly within a normal range.  The way of managing patients with suspected liver disease has been recently modified by the advent of transient elastography (TE) [9]. This methodology accurately quantifies liver fat by measuring the so-called controlled attenuation parameter (controlled attenuation parameter (CAP)), which identifies steatosis independently from the presence of fibrosis [10]. Thus, the use of TE with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurement in prediabetes may allow us to risk stratify these patients, to assess their progression of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and to evaluate the possible reversibility of their liver disease in the context of specific intervention strategies.",d7c01a2c-6ece-4912-9cd9-7a26b0190909
3,introduction3,"  Lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes and increase in physical activity have been previously documented as interventions for control of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [11, 12]. Exercise contributes to NASH regression by reducing insulin resistance, decreasing the synthesis of free fatty acids (FFAs) and their storage into triglycerides [12]. Insulin sensitizers like metformin have shown improvement of liver enzymatic factors but without any effect of liver histology [13]. Similarly, therapy with herbal drugs like silymarin, a complex of flowers and leaves of Silybum marianum (milk thistle), has shown improvement of transaminases in the context of liver disease [14, 15]. Nevertheless, the combined effect of nutraceuticals and diet on liver fibrosis and its possible regression in prediabetic patients remains understudied.",70fedee3-dc43-4d87-9940-f3a3888cf1f1
4,introduction4,"  With these considerations in mind, we herein propose to investigate which specific genetic factors and patients’ demographics can be effectively utilized as critical variables in the risk stratification analysis of prediabetic patients with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Finally, by using TE with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurement, we specifically evaluate whether prediabetic patients who undergo lifestyle changes and use of silymarin have a significant regression of fibrosis relative to their initial baseline.

A written informed consent was obtained from all eligible patients (n = 212, of whom n = 157 were males) before participation. All were subjected to full history and clinical examination to assess history of hypertension, history of drug use, any chronic illness, and family history of diabetes.  All patients met, at least once, with a dietician for nutritional guidance, and were encouraged to start and maintain a low-calorie diet before study enrollment. The moderate-fat, restricted-calorie, Mediterranean diet was rich in vegetables and low in red meat, with poultry and fish replacing beef and lamb.",7d4687a1-70ec-42d6-902d-d8846cdfe6f3
10,methods4," We restricted energy intake to 1500 kcal per day for women and 1800 kcal per day for men.  At enrollment, 210 mg BID of silymarin (a flavonolignan complex isolated from Silybum marianum and Morus alba [Meda Pharma]) were added to the regimen of 108 patients (group 2) and supplementation was continued for the entirety of the study (6 months). At each visit, we enquired from the participants about any adverse events and medication compliance.  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) evaluation  Abdominal ultrasonography was performed after a fasting period of 12 h, by a radiologist who was blinded about the patients’ information. All patients underwent ultrasound examination of the liver; a sagittal sonographic plane of the section demonstrating the hepatic parenchyma and right kidney echogenicity was used for determination of liver parenchyma echogenicity [16]. With the same kidney cortex and liver parenchyma echogenicity it is evaluated as normal, no fatty liver (Grade 0).",5ddc1750-1586-4e79-829f-447c0e51879e
11,methods5," The liver steatosis was classified into 3 grades, as follows: Mild (Grade 1) - minimal diffuse increase in hepatic echogenicity, normal visualization of the diaphragm and intrahepatic vessels; Moderate (Grade 2) - medium diffuse increase in hepatic echogenicity, impaired visualization of intrahepatic vessels and diaphragm; Severe (Grade 3) - severe diffuse increase in hepatic echogenicity. Posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe is difficult to display. Failure to visualize the walls of the intrahepatic vessels and a marked decrease in the reflectivity of the hemidiaphragm.  LS was evaluated by TE (FibroScan®, Echosens, Paris, France). Measurements of LS and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) were performed on the same day as abdominal ultrasonography after fasting for at least 12 h. The LS measurements from TE were performed on the right lobe of the liver through the intercostal space of patients in the position of dorsal decubitus with the right arm in maximum abduction.",2ae8e5a2-5104-4823-ab0e-b8922ab530dd
12,methods6,"  TE was performed by a blind expert technician on patient clinical data. The median value of the successful measurements was selected as representative of the LS and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) values ​​of the subjects. The controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measured the ultrasonic attenuation at 3.5 MHz using the signals acquired by TE [17]. As an indicator of variability, the interquartile range (IQR) ratios of the LS and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) values ​​with respect to the median values ​​(interquartile range (IQR)/M and interquartile range (IQR)/Mcontrolled attenuation parameter (CAP), respectively) were calculated. In this study, only procedures with at least ten valid measurements, a success rate of at least 60% and an interquartile range (IQR)/M value of LS less than 0.3 were considered reliable and used for the statistical analysis.",3cd39674-160e-4562-b61f-e60f80441b4a
13,methods7,"  To correct variability in the general population, LS values ​​in prediabetic patients were compared to those observed in 126 healthy blood donors, (n = 94 males, 75%; p = 0.861). To define the presence of significant fibrosis, we used the cut-off value of 7.9 kPa, as proposed by others [18]. Furthermore, in prediabetics we measured the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), to classify hepatic steatosis by measuring the degree of US attenuation by liver fat [19]. controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) values ​​range from 100 to 400 dB/m: the cut-off values ​​we have chosen to indicate steatosis as absent, mild, moderate and severe were < 236 dB/m, ≥236 dB/m, ≥270 dB/m and ≥ 302 dB/m, respectively [20]. Finally, the Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and FIB-4 fibrosis score were calculated for each patient, as previously reported [21, 22].",1a233d12-b88c-45ea-9d35-0de64e7ab6f5

31,discussion0," Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a slowly progressive disease, where the rate of progression is influenced by the stage at initial diagnosis, as observed in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [23]. The prevalence of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is higher among diabetics than in the general population [24]. Furthermore, patients with prediabetes are more likely to have more severe histological forms of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [25]. In patients with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, liver lipogenesis is elevated while fatty acid oxidation remains decreased; at the same time, peripheral insulin resistance increases fatty acid release from adipose tissue and promotes their hepatic uptake. This milieu favors the progressive development of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with prediabetes, and increases the likelihood of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to progress to NASH and cirrhosis [26, 27].",65403774-4e43-4e87-a420-08cf09e635b4
32,discussion1," These results support the idea that in prediabetic patients, early diagnosis and treatment of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is paramount.  Our study shows that in an unselected cohort of patients with prediabetes, not previously known to have Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the prevalence of liver disease is unexpectedly high. The clinical characteristics of the recruited patients explain most of the variability observed, with a significant contribution offered by the genetic profile. As shown in Table 4, the age and the duration of the prediabetic condition do not contribute significantly to the prevalence of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Yet, as previously shown, we also observe that excess body weight facilitates progression of liver fibrosis (Tables 4, 5) [28].",2e66915c-4479-4108-8bd3-e7c1a1b6c9f4
33,discussion2,"  The reason obesity affects the pathophysiology of liver damage is likely related to the fact that leptin induces pro-inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines, thus altering the liver wound-healing response [29–31].  In recent years, in addition to environmental factors and comorbidities, genetic predictors of progression of liver disease have also been identified [32]. The strongest genetic predictor of progression of chronic liver disease is SNS rs738409 in the PNLPA3 gene, which encodes a membrane-bound triacylglycerol lipase mediating the hydrolysis of the triacylglycerol. This “missense” mutation causes a reduction in the enzymatic activity of PNPLA3, leading to the development of macrovascular steatosis [33, 34]. In our study, we evaluate how the PNPLA3 mutation plays a part in the progression of liver disease in prediabetes.",a08a0363-3be5-4be0-a1db-94a3da688621
34,discussion3," Increased risk of hepatic fibrosis in patients with DMT2 who are carriers for the mutated variant of rs738409 was previously reported [35, 36]; yet, the estimate of liver fibrosis was based on Fibrotest rather than on liver stiffness. Herein, we show the existence of significantly increased liver stiffness in mutated heterozygous and homozygotes compared to wild-type PNPLA3 in prediabetic patients (Table 3). We can thus infer that in prediabetic patients, PNLPA3 contributes to the progression of liver disease; nevertheless, in prediabetics, unlike in the general population, the net effect may be driven by excess BMI. In fact, our results indicate that of the 22 patients who are homozygous rs738409 G/G, 13 of them had LS > 7.9 kPa and of those 13 patients all of them had BMI > 28. Instead, in the 9 patients homozygous for rs738409 G/G who had LS < 7.9 kPa only 2 of them (22%) had a BMI > 28.",c0a97055-2975-4b94-b344-3e20ba7db315
35,discussion4," This observation suggests that elevated BMI index may synergistically modulate fibrosis progression in specific variants of PNLPA3. Similarly, increase in BMI augments the effect of M variant on the prevalence of cirrhosis [37]. Therefore, a future study should be conducted on patients with BMI greater >30 to further analyze the significance of this interaction between PNPLA3 gene and BMI in the contest of prediabetes and progression of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to significant fibrosis.  Though genetic variants may be considered in the construction of prediction models aimed to detect the progression of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to fibrosis in patients with prediabetes, the use of Fibroscan in this patient population remains paramount.",632d3f1b-e4ac-4ae0-8607-a49f31a06c70
36,discussion5," The prevalence of moderate to advanced steatosis scored using controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), independently of BMI, does not significantly differ between the control group and patients with prediabetes (see Table 1, 52% vs 58%, p = 0.3); nevertheless, when using LS as a measure of liver fibrosis, there appears to be a significant difference in advanced steatosis when comparing these two groups (Table 1, 3% vs 29%, p < 0.001), thus indicating that prediabetic state plays a critical factor in the progression of steatosis to fibrosis. The role of TE should be particularly underscored in that group of prediabetic patients with mild fibrosis (LS 5.9–7.9 kPa) as transaminase levels are not elevated in this patient group (see Table 4); this indicates that transaminases levels are not a good indicator of mild fibrosis and can lead to a sense of false reassurance in this group of patients.",d6daad73-4972-44ce-8766-f0982a18e266
37,discussion6," Nonetheless, we show that transaminases, together with BMI, remain the principle indicators associated with significant fibrosis (Tables 4 and 5).  As aforementioned, lifestyle modifications are recommended for control of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [11, 12]. It has been demonstrated that an intensive weight loss program led to resolution of NASH and improvement of fibrosis [38]. Moreover, follow-up studies on morbidly obese patients that underwent bariatric surgery have also showed that the extent of weight loss correlates with the degree of NASH and fibrosis [39]. We herein show that prediabetic patients who follow a Mediterranean diet and achieve weight loss greater than 5% experienced a significant regression of fibrosis after 6 months (mean LS is 6.70 vs. 5.90; p < 0.001, Table 6). In recent years, the use of natural products has been considered for the treatment of hyperglycemia.",d37f4934-e203-4c9a-bca9-8d057699799a
38,discussion7," Furthermore, the protective effects of silymarin as a powerful ROS scavenger, and its hepato-protective effects via attenuation of pro-inflammatory gene expression in the liver have been discussed previously [40]. There is also recent experimental evidence that in diabetic rats treated with silymarin and in which weight reduction was achieved, markers of hepatic injury were significantly reduced and favorable histopathological changes were showed [41]. Randomized control trials have shown that regimens with either silymarin alone or its most active biological compound silybin lead to liver aminotransferase reduction in patients with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) after only 3 months [42–44]. One of these studies also investigated the role of silymarin therapy in the context of PNPLA3 polymorphism and showed that PNPLA3 G-allele carriers did not receive any benefits from treatment with silymarin.",253649ac-884e-450b-9f80-20e3f4f9612c
39,discussion8," Furthermore, silymarin together with lifestyle modification has an increased safety profile relative to other anti-oxidant inhibitors or anti-fibrotic agents while conserving liver-enzyme ameliorating effects in patients with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [45, 46]. A systematic review of clinical trials conducted between 2003 and 2008 did not report any significant side effects attributable to silymarin therapy compared to the placebo-treated population and also did not show any significant interactions with other drugs [47]. Given its safety profile, silymarin continues to be widely used in the treatment of acute or chronic hepatitis. Yet, no study has shown regression of liver fibrosis with silymarin therapy upon assessment with Fibroscan. We thus investigated whether in patients with hepatic steato-fibrosis and prediabetes the reduction of body weight > 5% and the intake of silymarin reduces progression of comorbid liver disease.",a37b4564-0b81-41ce-8033-4e034db5c0a3
40,discussion9," We show that Mediterranean diet either alone or in conjunction with silymarin regimen leads to a significant reduction of liver fibrosis, normalization of aminotransferase (ALT) and significant reduction in HbA1c and FBS. Nevertheless, after controlling for pre-intervention (baseline) biochemical parameters, there is no difference in fibrosis regression between the treatment with only Mediterranean diet versus silymarin plus Mediterranean diet (p = 0.696). Finally, it should be underscored that both Mediterranean diet with weight reduction greater than 5% alone and in conjunction with silymarin treatment lead to significant reduction of HbA1c (p < 0.001, Table 6). Interestingly, diet with weight reduction greater than 5% together with silymarin regimen leads to a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c when compared to diet alone (95% CI: 37.8–38.6 vs 39.5–40.3, p < 0.001, Table 6). Interestingly, Li et al.",d5de39bc-e69c-49fa-bec8-34f5763ba1ee
41,discussion10," showed the role of silybin in the prevention of palmitate-induced insulin resistance and inhibition of the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway in skeletal muscle cells [48]. These observations imply that silymarin may play an important role in glycemic control and it may be of interest to investigate its anti-glycemic properties in isolation in future studies. Among the various limitations of this study, we must note the fact that Fibroscan is not the best method to characterize Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, compared to the magnetic resonance evaluation, the evaluation with TE is much more practicable and at lower cost in clinical practice.  In conclusion, it is critical to acknowledge that patients with prediabetic status have a high prevalence of liver disease characterized by significant fibrosis, which goes largely unnoticed in the absence of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.",00685c8f-9d1a-4255-9c0f-fa19793f224b
42,discussion11," We herein show how increased BMI and genetic factors represent critical variables in the risk stratification analysis of prediabetic patients with Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Lastly, we propose that Mediterranean diet together with intake of the nutraceutical silymarin contributes to the regression of liver damage and diabetes markers.
