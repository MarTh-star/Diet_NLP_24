Objective  To explore a) the level of adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) and consumption of fermented foods by first episode of psychosis (first episode of psychosis (FEP)s) patients taking APs, in comparison to matched -for age and body mass index (BMI)- healthy controls (HCs), and b) the effect of this dietary pattern on the biochemical and metabolic profile of first episode of psychosis (FEP)s.  Method  The study population consisted of 33 first episode of psychosis (FEP)s treated with APs for less than 5 years, with no history of other chronic diseases, and an equal number of HCs. The first episode of psychosis (FEP)s were classified into two subgroups, according to their AP medication, depending on the documented risk of weight gain.",6906c0fc-178f-4be5-894a-6fb1c217fff1
1,background1," A validated questionnaire for the adherence to Mediterranean diet and a food frequency questionnaire for selected fermented foods were completed by first episode of psychosis (FEP)s and HC. Anthropometric data and blood measurements were recorded for all participants.  Results and conclusions  The first episode of psychosis (FEP)s showed a relevant lower overall adherence to the MedDiet, but no differences in consumption of fermented foods. Type of antipsychotic therapy uncovered differences in platelet count, vitamin B12, HDL and glucose (p < 0.05) between the subgroups of first episode of psychosis (FEP)s and HCs, although no values were abnormal. The MedDiet score was found to act as a prognostic factor for abnormal glucose levels in first episode of psychosis (FEP)s treated with APs associated with weight gain (p = 0.04). These results need to be confirmed by observations after long term adherence to MedDiet.",dac9b3d2-d1fc-4252-985e-5c036632780b

Well documented evidence shows second-generation antipsychotics (APs) to be comparable in efficacy to, if not more effective than, first-generation APs, but with better tolerability and less adverse effects [2].",cd2c9f3c-0bbd-4c72-adef-84e5680aef58
3,background3," More than half of the patients in one study showed symptomatic remission and one quarter (26.4 %) functional remission, while one-fifth (19.2 %) recovered completely after receiving second generation AP treatment [3].  The side effects of APs, however, and in particular, weight gain, obesity, and metabolic disturbances, can constitute significant contributors to the health burden of people with psychosis. Subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat may increase significantly after the initiation of AP treatment [4], and increases in the levels of circulating lipids and non-fasting glucose have been observed in all patients, but especially in women [5]. Consequently, the risk of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is increased by two to three times in patients with schizophrenia taking APs, with a reduction in life expectancy by one fifth, compared with the general population [6].",d2e51984-393c-4904-a1d0-c08e2884027b
4,background4,"  All APs have been found to be correlated with the induction of metabolic complications and weight gain [7] but aripiprazole, amisulpride, quetiapine, paliperidone and ziprasidone appear to induce less intense effects than olanzapine, asenapine, clozapine and risperidone [8,9].  The etiology of the metabolic disturbances in schizophrenia is multifactorial and may be associated not only with AP treatment, but also with high levels of stress, a poor diet, and reduced physical activity [10].  First-episode psychosis (first episode of psychosis (FEP)s) patients should be distinguished from patients with chronic psychiatric disease [11] as the former appear to be more vulnerable to weight gain and drug related metabolic disturbances [8]. In addition, after the initiation of AP treatment, the dietary habits of first episode of psychosis (FEP)s are characterized by a high intake of saturated fat and refined carbohydrates, and low consumption of fiber and fruit [12].",a500a6a8-c0eb-4ed5-8e13-acb31a09954b
5,background5," Low adherence to healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been observed in a high proportion of first episode of psychosis (FEP)s (60 %) [13].  A healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, such as MedDiet [14], is recommended for patients with mental disorders, and regular exercise, and smoking cessation are also documented to reduce their metabolic and cardiovascular risk [15]. In addition, the prophylactic effect of gut microbiome enrichment with probiotics via fermented foods has been demonstrated [16].  Nutritional psychiatry has generated reliable evidence that through the gut-brain axis interactions, a diet rich in antioxidants and low processed natural foods, such as fermented foods, is a modifiable factor for the promotion of the health of mind and body [17], but clinicians often refer to dietary intervention for patients with psychosis as resembling a hurdle race [16].",a9a158d0-221b-4284-b017-ca2ed3c2c082
6,background6,"  MedDiet has consistently been associated with reduction in the levels of various coagulation and inflammation markers related to cardiovascular disease (CVD), including C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) and platelets [18], and a healthy anti-inflammatory diet might therefore be protective against the metabolic complications of psychosis and AP treatment. This observational study aimed to explore: a) the level of adherence to the MedDiet and consumption of selected fermented foods by first episode of psychosis (FEP)s with psychosis, in comparison to matched healthy control subjects (HCs), and b) the associations of MedDiet, fermented foods and APs on the anthropometric and biochemical/metabolic profile of first episode of psychosis (FEP)s, in comparison to HCs.  2 Methodology  2.",3145eb58-c539-499f-acf2-ec7f2d02a4ac

20,background27,"  4 Discussion  This study aimed to identify the possible association of disturbances in the metabolic profile and inflammatory indices of first episode of psychosis (FEP)s according to their AP treatment, and to explore the potential protective role of MedDiet and the consumption of selected fermented foods. Differences were observed in the mean levels of several inflammatory and metabolic indices between the two first episode of psychosis (FEP) subgroups groups taking different APs, and the HCs, although the values were not abnormal. Despite the other sub-clinical differences, only abnormal glucose levels in patients treated with anti-psychotics related to increased weight gain, appeared to be affected with the adherence to MedDiet.  A decade ago, Thornicroft labeled the unilateral therapeutic model for mental disorders factors, which he believed were not sufficiently considered, and which reduce the life expectancy of patients treated for psychosis by approximately two decades [22].",27ae5bf4-2544-4bb7-9d29-029e7e99fde3
21,background28," Gut microbiome, dietary modification, and association with immune, metabolic and psychopathological functioning in psychosis is recognized, but not well characterized [23]. Among others, the MedDiet pattern, mostly due to the high fiber content, is proposed for halting the metabolic and immune related complications of schizophrenia and APs use [23,24]. The first episode of psychosis (FEP)s in this study, although living in the Mediterranean basin, reported only moderate adherence to the MedDiet compared with their matched HCs. Notwithstanding, lower scores on the MedDiet scale were due mainly to the lower consumption of whole wheat products and pulses, both well documented for promoting beneficial gut microbiota composition and protecting from inflammation [25]. The olive oil effect could not be further evaluated in the under-study population, as it was similar in comparison with the HC group. Recently though its overall antioxidant effect was disputed, as Kouka et al.",4b104e6a-6870-4672-acd5-a901f7165c90
22,background29," proposed that it can induce oxidative stress in some tissues, namely spleen, pancreas, liver and heart [26]. Presumably, the continuous inflammation in the gut-brain axis in first episode of psychosis (FEP)s is linked with the Western-type diet, with less pulses and fish, more meat and meat products, highly refined starchy products without their intact fibers, convenience foods and sweetened beverages - all high in calories, sugars, fats- including olive oil, trans fats, and saturated fats- salt and other food additives [27].  The unhealthy dietary habits of first episode of psychosis (FEP)s can be partly justified by their treatment with APs, which, on interaction with serotonergic, histaminergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems, provoke changes in appetite and food intake [28,29]. Saugo et al. suggested early dietary and lifestyle interventions in first episode of psychosis (FEP)s, as Aps side effects reveal withing the first months of the initiation of AP treatment [13].",36cd2791-c39a-4eaa-a020-08bf6986beb8
23,background30,"  In a “frugal” model of the psychosis etiology, the condition has been described as partly the result of a homeostatic signaling imbalance, caused by metabolic abnormalitites, increased inflammation and immune dysregulation [30]. Apart from the nature of the disease itself, the APs administered for its treatment induce various severe metabolic disturbances that, in combination with the disease, create a deleterious environment [31].  It is recognized that minor increases in inflammation constitute a precursor for several chronic metabolic-related conditions, including obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 DM, even in otherwise healthy individuals [24].  The first episode of psychosis (FEP) group in this study, in comparison with the HC group, presented subclinical differences in a cluster of inflammatory and metabolic markers, sometimes associated with the AP medication.",01dac365-8c0f-4050-90b0-28a37e79dda7
24,background31," Specifically, in the first episode of psychosis (FEP) AP1 group, the platelet count was higher; in addition to their role in hemostasis and thrombosis, platelets are related to the production of several inflammatory markers [32]. The higher glucose levels in the first episode of psychosis (FEP) AP2 subgroup may be indicative of a sub-clinical oxidative stress response of the pancreatic cells, also related to the reduced adherence to the MedDiet. In a study of Hsu et al., clozapine categorized here in the AP2, was associated with glucose dysregulation in a mouse model [33]. In first episode of psychosis (FEP) treated with AP2, MedDiet appeared to be beneficial in regulating glucose levels [34].  The significantly lower mean levels of vitamin B12 in all first episode of psychosis (FEP)s compared with the HC group is a further signal of their sub-clinical disturbed metabolism.",52d59725-e4f9-489e-97a6-d20217302e3f
25,background32," Low levels of B12 have been linked with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and specifically with the raised levels of homocysteine and cortisol in untreated subjects [35]. Notably, in the current study, the first episode of psychosis (FEP)s consumed more red meat products than the HCs, although not to a statistically significant degree, constituting their main source of B12 [36], and therefore enhancing disturbances in the metabolic processes.  In addition, both subgroups of first episode of psychosis (FEP)s had lower HDL levels than the HCs. Suboptimal levels of HDL, apart from increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications [37], have been considered to play a role on brain myelination, with an increase of negative symptoms [38].  One significant limitation of this study was that, as it was cross-sectional in nature, it included only one-point measurements, which restricted our ability to determine a cause-and-effect relationship.",b74f209c-82ba-447e-a115-4c720a02ad32
26,background33," For this reason, we cannot proceed to definite conclusions on whether the pro-inflammatory and metabolic differences were related to the disease and/or the AP therapy. Because of the small sample size, we could not formulate definite conclusions on the different effects of the two categories of AP, although some were apparent. In addition, as the first episode of psychosis (FEP)s had been taking an AP medication for an average of 3.3 years, no information could be extracted regarding the initial drug-naive phase.  5 Conclusions  Overall, the results of this study are suggestive that in well-controlled first episode of psychosis (FEP)s taking AP2, which are documented to be associated with higher weight gain, an increase in MedDiet adherence can benefit glucose modulation. The first episode of psychosis (FEP)s in this study taking APs presented low-grade systemic inflammation, presumably interdependent with metabolic-related conditions.",0030dd74-ce84-4c5f-af9e-c56ff2878505
27,background34," This metabolo-immunologic profile can be compared with a “sleeping volcano preparing for eruption”. Our results are promising regarding the potential of MedDiet for balancing the metabolism disturbed by APs, and restoring anti-inflammatory and antioxidant depositories. Long-term personalized dietary intervention in the spectrum of MedDiet for first episode of psychosis (FEP)s treated with APs could provide more powerful conclusions.
