0,introduction0,"High blood pressure is a leading disease risk factor globally, and cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) is a main cause of death1. Therefore, the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains of utmost importance, and changes in dietary factors have an important rôle. While dietary recommendations for primary disease prevention have focused mainly on dietary patterns and macronutrients2, increasing attention has been given to a group of non-nutritive dietary compounds, bioactives, that are thought to exert a physiological effect and to modulate disease risk3. Flavan-3-ols are a major class of dietary bioactives4–6, belonging to the group of polyphenolics, commonly found in tea, pome fruits, berries, cocoa-derived products and nuts. Accumulating evidence from dietary intervention studies shows that the intake of flavan-3-ols improves vascular function in healthy adults6,7.",2c6d7604-32da-422c-b8b0-fe0f9b0d06c3
1,introduction1," Indeed, multiple clinical dietary intervention studies have demonstrated flavanol-intake related cardiovascular health benefits by assessing physiological endpoints including blood pressure, flow-mediated arterial dilation, augmentation index, pulse wave velocity and arterial stiffness, as well as atherogenesis8–10. However, the data currently available are neither describing effects at sufficient scale nor were derived from long-term investigations and are thus insufficient provide the basis for population-based dietary guidance6.",84fdf165-1114-4c2a-82e4-04e64e88467f
2,introduction2," While ongoing large-scale clinical dietary intervention studies, such as COSMOS (NCT0242274511), with specific focus on cardiovascular disease risk and outcomes measures that include stroke, myocardial infarction and blood pressure, are intended to close this gap, large-scale observational studies can provide crucial information about associations between habitual flavan-3-ol intake and vascular health, especially as these studies usually include a wide range of different foods and beverages and are based on a more heterogeneous population representative of the general public.  Importantly, large-scale observational studies rely on the accurate assessment of intake. To date, all such studies aiming to estimate flavan-3-ol intake were based on self-reported dietary data, food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) or food diaries, in combination with food composition data.",9653adf6-4d08-44a4-8e24-55db20ee6a8b
3,introduction3," While this approach, in the absence of practicable alternatives, has been tacitly accepted as de facto standard12–16, it introduces significant limitations that substantially affect outcome and interpretation. Self-reported dietary data are subject to a number of limitations and have been demonstrated to be subject to systematic bias17. Detailed analyses, for example of protein and energy18, but also sugar intake19, have shown systematic under-reporting. While these methods can provide reliable data on dietary patterns and intake of individual foods, these limitations affect the ability to estimate intake of individual compounds. This is further exacerbated by the reliance on food composition data, which can only provide data on average food content and not the composition of the foods actually consumed.",7e8ddbe1-c4ed-45d0-b83a-66ba0ed97f6a
4,introduction4," For flavan-3-ols but also other compounds found in foods, this approach introduces significant error due to the large variability of food composition20, the effects of processing21 and differences in bioavailability. Thus, the reliance on food composition data to estimate flavan-3-ol intake introduces a considerable measurement error: for example, the amount found in tea, one of the main dietary sources in the UK diet22, ranges from 10 to 330 mg/100 g20. This problem is made worse by the common reliance on FFQs, which do not provide sufficient detail on food intake to allow an accurate estimate of actual intake23.  In contrast, nutritional biomarkers, which are assessed by measuring the systemic presence of dietary compounds or their metabolites, have the potential to mitigate the above limitations and thus enable objective and accurate estimates of actual intake24–26.",9018dc20-baeb-41da-ba27-42462f49a60f
5,introduction5," As biomarkers for estimating flavan-3-ol intake were not available previously, we developed and evaluated at scale nutritional biomarkers to estimate the intake of flavan-3-ols in general, based on the flavan-3-ol-derived microbial metabolite 5-3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactone (gVLM)27, and one specific for (–)-epicatechin intake, based on structurally related (–)-epicatechin metabolites (SREM)28. The biomarkers derived from those metabolites, referred to as gVLMB and SREMB, are surrogate biomarkers29 when assessed in spot urine and therefore allow people to be ranked according to their flavan-3-ol intake.  These novel biomarkers allow rigorous, and more objective and accurate investigations into associations between actual flavan-3-ol intake and health in observational cohorts at scales relevant to human populations.",221aa92a-5610-4106-aed0-07913e7bea0c

Cross-sectional associations between flavan-3-ol biomarker and blood pressure The evidence available from a wide range of clinical intervention studies show that flavan-3-ols can have a vasculoprotective effect6, but this has never been shown on a large scale in a general population. We have therefore investigated the cross-sectional association between flavan-3-ol intake and blood pressure at baseline (Fig.  2).

25,results5," We have further investigated whether the biomarker merely acts as a surrogate marker of specific dietary patterns that are associated with blood pressure. Tea is a main dietary source of flavan-3-ol in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk15, and thus gVLMB and SREMB could both act as a marker of high tea or low coffee intake, as there was a strong inverse association between tea and coffee intake (Pearson’s ρ = 0.4); similarly, fruits and vegetables can be an important contributor of flavan-3-ols. However, adjusting our data analysis additionally for tea and coffee intake, as well plasma vitamin C, as a surrogate marker of fruit and vegetable intake30, associations did not change materially (Table 2).

In addition, the difference in systolic blood pressure between the top and bottom decile of the SREMB- and gVLMB-estimated flavan-3-ol intake in older men (>60 years) was greater than that in younger men. Finally, significant differences were also observed in women with low and high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using SREMB as biomarker of flavan-3-ol intake.Figure 3 Subgroup- and sensitivity analysis, comparing estimated differences in systolic blood pressure between sex-specific bottom (p10) and top (p90) decile of biomarker-estimated flavan-3-ol intake.

35,discussion0,"In participants of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk, a large cohort representative of the older general public in England31, high flavan-3-ol intake was associated with a significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure and was inversely associated with blood lipids. We did not observe consistent, statistically significant associations between biomarkers of flavan-3-ol intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence or mortality.  This study was enabled by recently developed nutritional biomarkers, gVLMB and SREMB, that allow for estimating specifically the intake of flavan-3-ols. We have shown previously that gVLMB and SREMB reflect actual intake of flavan-3-ols and (–)-epicatechin respectively, yet importantly here we found only a weak correlation between biomarker and self-reported food intake27,28.",c0b5e79b-2064-4458-9cc8-139cadc49297
36,discussion1," This finding strongly supports our previous findings of the impact of the high variability in food composition on self-reported dietary assessment methods23. The high variability in food composition of many of the main sources of dietary flavan-3-ol make an accurate estimate without an analysis of the actual food consumed virtually impossible. For example, food composition data20 for black tea give a range of flavan-3-ol content of 3–64 mg/100 mL, and thus five cups of tea can contain between 23 and 480 mg of flavan-3-ols. Thus, a person consuming a single cup of tea with high flavan-3-ol content consumes considerably more flavan-3-ols than a person consuming five cups of tea with low flavan-3-ol content. A wide variability in food composition has been reported for other foods, too. Indeed, even for foods grown on the self-same plant, up to 2.5-fold differences for some nutrients have been observed32.",4f64e8ce-f5cd-4aba-bb34-0f42030e3921
37,discussion2," In contrast, the objective nutritional biomarkers used in this study take into account the diversity in the foods consumed and differences in bioavailability as they rely on the systemic presence of the respective compounds. The inclusion of the main dietary sources of flavan-3-ols and (–)-epicatechin in our statistical models (i.e. tea as well as fruit and vegetables22) did not affect outcomes (Table 2, models 3 and 5), which strongly supports the notion that the data provided by the nutritional biomarkers is related to the actual intake of bioactive compound and does not just reflect dietary patterns.  The two different biomarkers of flavan-3-ol intake used here (gVLMB and SREMB), enabled estimating the dietary intake of flavan-3-ols27 and the flavan-3-ol (–)-epicatechin28, respectively. The differences between the effect sizes estimated with either biomarker were negligible (Tables 2 and 3), and this can to some extent be explained by the correlation between the two biomarkers.",1a0d0d60-49d3-4eb9-9236-9a96ac9e5b00
38,discussion3," However, the two biomarkers used in this study originate from two distinct metabolic pathways, gVLMB from the catabolism of flavan-3-ols in the gut microbiome, SREMB from phase II biotransformation reactions of (–)-epicatechin. Thus, these results pose the question as to whether the observed association between flavan-3-ol intake and blood pressure could be explained by the specific intake of (–)-epicatechin, as it is the only compound measured with both biomarkers. In this context, previous intervention studies have established a vascular effect for (–)-epicatechin33, and showed that only (–)-epicatechin, but no other type of flavan-3-ols exert such activity34. While larger controlled dietary intervention studies are necessary to establish the actual bioactive compound and mode of action, our results clearly show an inverse association between flavan-3-ols, including (–)-epicatechin, and blood pressure, and thereby contribute to the data available to investigate a causal effect.",7541073e-6358-48f9-80ad-c521eaa1cca3
39,discussion4," While the specific molecular mechanisms that underlie the cardiovascular effects of flavanols are still under investigation, currently published work in this context indicates that flavanols mediate a range of effects on the cellular-/molecular level that impact on endothelial function, nitric oxide-dependent arterial dilation, thrombogenic responses, and processes related to vascular inflammation, angiogenesis, and endothelial repair8–10,35–37.  In comparison with the observed associations with blood pressure, the associations with blood lipids were rather modest. However, they were of a similar magnitude and direction than those observed in the Minnesota Green Tea Trial (MGTT38), even though flavan-3-ol intakes in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk were considerably lower.  Impact on health In this study, we could demonstrate significant inverse associations between biomarkers of flavan-3-ol and (–)-epicatechin intake and blood pressure at baseline.",f0f43760-f444-40db-b738-e8528dba5f64
40,discussion5," However, there were no consistent, statistically significant associations with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk or mortality (cardiovascular disease (CVD) related and all-cause) (Table 4). This can be explained by the magnitude of difference in systolic blood pressure observed, which would not be expected to have significant impact on individual cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (approximately 0.2 percentage points reduction in 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk based on QRISK 339).  The difference in systolic blood pressure observed here between low and high biomarker concentration in the cross-sectional analysis (approximately 2 mmHg) is similar to the reduction in blood pressure observed in dietary intervention studies7. This difference is comparable to those observed with a Mediterranean diet in the PREDIMED trial (1.5 mmHg40) or a moderate reduction in salt intake in the DASH-Sodium trial (2.",dbe1fea6-6d35-4ac4-875a-f949aa8b468d
41,discussion6,"1 mmHg, high to intermediate sodium intake41), and could have considerable impact on health at a population scale. However, large-scale dietary intervention studies such as COSMOS (NCT0242274511) are required to confirm whether the observed differences in blood pressure can be explained by differences in flavan-3-ol intake.  A subgroup analyses showed that the association between intake and blood pressure was strongest among participants at higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, in particular older participants and those with existing hypertension, confirming results from previous small-scale dietary intervention studies7. The association between intake and blood pressure therefore follows a progressive model42, where the strongest effect size is found in those with higher blood pressure (Fig. 4). Such a model has also been observed in other dietary interventions such as the effect of potassium43 or sodium44 intake on blood pressure or the DASH diet45.",011223c4-644b-4894-adef-0b454dcf61bb
42,discussion7," In such a model, even a small reduction in blood pressure can have a considerable impact on morbidity and mortality on a population scale as it reduces the prevalence of hypertension and pre-hypertension, and thus the number of people at higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Indeed, a reduction of 3 mmHg systolic blood pressure can be translated into a reduction in all-cause mortality by 3%42,46. Flavanol intake could therefore have a role in the maintenance of cardiovascular health on a population scale.Figure 4 Distribution of systolic blood pressure of participants of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) Norfolk in the bottom (p10) and top (p90) decile of flavan-3-ol intake (estimated by gVLMB).

Nutritional interpretation The differences in blood pressure observed in this study were seen in a population with relatively high habitual intakes of flavan-3-ol and not any supplementation as has been used in intervention studies.",a6048435-ea70-4c7c-8a3b-43932ba7f439
44,discussion9," In this context, it is noteworthy that, while representative of the UK population, the diet of participants of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk regarding flavan-3-ol intake may not be representative of countries without a strong tea culture, including countries in continental Europe and the US15. Compared to European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk, it is therefore possible that a larger fraction of the population in countries without a tea culture could benefit from increasing the intake of flavan-3-ol in their diets. In addition, the question is still open as to whether or not the intake of flavan-3-ols beyond the ranges in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk population would be associated with a further reduction in blood pressure. In any case, the large variability of flavan-3-ol content in foods precludes the identification of a diet that would result in a given increase of flavan-3-ol intake.",0e5e8cf1-fe7e-489f-a89f-b0dd1b04a91f
45,discussion10," While incorporating foods and beverages, such as tea, apples and berries, would probably increase intake of flavan-3-ols in the diet, it will depend not only on the type of food, but also on the actual product variety (species) consumed, the manufacturing conditions in which that product was generated and preserved and mode of preparation. This makes more specific recommendations impossible.  The biomarkers used in this study were surrogate biomarkers29. They are used to rank participants according to intake, but it is not possible to use them to calculate the actual amount of flavan-3-ol consumed. In order to estimate the amount consumed by participants in the top decile of intake, we have therefore used data from 7-day food diaries and calculated flavan-3-ol intakes using not only mean food content, as is common practice, but the entire range of reported food content (Fig. 5).",6b682221-0a49-4351-87fe-fb1ba77f5f09
46,discussion11," Participants in the top decile of flavan-3-ol intake consumed at least 146 mg/day when using minimum, and 618 mg/day when using maximum food content (260 mg/day when using mean food content data) of flavan-3-ols, and at least 4 mg/day (minimum food content) or 138 mg/day (maximum food content) of (–)-epicatechin (36 mg/day when using mean food content data). While these figures provide an initial estimation, further efforts are needed to obtain a more precise number if these data are expected to be used for the development of dietary recommendations of flavan-3-ols as bioactive.  Strengths and limitations The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort is ideally placed to investigate potential associations between flavan-3-ol intake and cardiovascular disease risk factors, not only because of its size, but also because it is set in a population with habitually high flavan-3-ol intake22.",a8da735e-df8e-4d5f-bd03-97d29e1847d0
47,discussion12," The main strength of the study is the use of robustly evaluated nutritional biomarkers to estimate flavan-3-ol27 and (–)-epicatechin28 intake and the use of 7-day-food diaries for dietary data. A limitation of the study is the reliance on a single spot-urine sample, as multiple samples would have provided a more representative estimation of habitual intake. The plasma half-life of gVLM, approximately 6 h, is sufficient to achieve steady-state like conditions with regular consumption27. As the main source of flavan-3-ol intake in a UK cohort is tea22, which is consumed regularly in a UK population, it can provide information on longer term intake. The half-life of SREM is considerably shorter, 2 h, and the biomarker therefore reflects mainly short-term intake. Further limitations are the largely cross-sectional nature and the inability to derive actual intake from surrogate biomarkers, only allowing the ranking of participants according to intake29.",9fc00998-a2a6-4637-a666-bebc68aa8280
48,discussion13,"  Conclusions This study demonstrates the importance of nutritional biomarkers to estimate intake of plant bioactives to investigate associations between intake and disease risk, as only biomarkers can provide reliable information on actual bioactive intake. It also raises the important question of the impact of the variability in food composition on nutritional research and dietary assessment. The results of our study show a significant and biomedically relevant inverse association between biomarkers of flavan-3-ol intake and blood pressure in a free-living general population with a wide range of flavan-3-ol intake from their habitual diet. The observed difference is approximately comparable to that of adherence with the Mediterranean Diet or moderate salt reduction, and likely to have a considerable impact on a population scale.",b5342942-4e9d-464d-8d1b-7c92913184df
