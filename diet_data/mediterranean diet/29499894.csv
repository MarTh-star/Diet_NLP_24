0,methods0,"2.1. Design and Procedure The InProS (Infancia y Procesamiento Sensorial (Childhood and Sensory Processing)) project is a population-based cross-sectional study of children aged 3–7 years recruited from a random selection of 21 schools located in the Alicante province, Spain. Recruitment took place between February and May 2016. After getting the permission from the principal of each school, approximately 1700 eligible children were invited to participate in this study through an invitation letter addressed to their parents that contained a participant information sheet outlining the project details, a booklet with several questionnaires, and the instructions on how to complete them. All children were asked to return the informed written parental consent and the questionnaires filled out. A total sample of 620 children returned the documentation required, rendering a response rate of approximately 37%.",361aa5c3-7ecb-486d-8fc2-0b10f72357d9
1,methods1," After excluding participants with missing data for outcome and exposure variables, a sample consisted of 583 (94%) was finally included in the present analysis. All participants provided informed consent and had no incentive to take part in this study. Ethical approval for this research was obtained from Miguel Hernández University and the research was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.   2.2. Study Variables Child sensory processing was measured by the short sensory profile (short sensory profile (SSP)), a screening tool used to identify children with sensory processing difficulties. The short sensory profile (SSP) is a parent report measure that consists of a 38-item questionnaire divided into seven different sections or subscales: tactile sensitivity, taste/smell sensitivity, movement sensitivity, under-responsive/seeks sensation, auditory filtering, low energy/weak, and visual/auditory sensitivity. All items are scored on a one-point to five-point scale (i.e.",2ef8eace-37ab-4ce8-a5de-26430dbed3ef
2,methods2,", ranging from 1–always to 5–never). The short sensory profile (SSP) was based on the sensory profile, the questionnaire created by Dunn (1999) [29], which was cross-culturally adapted and validated in Spanish children [30,31]. We obtained the short sensory profile (SSP) total score and the score on each subscale by summing up the respective values to classify children’s level of sensory abnormality (typical, probable difference, or definite difference) according to the cut-points proposed by Dunn [29]. Children with an atypical sensory performance were defined as follows: short sensory profile (SSP) total score <155; tactile sensitivity <30; taste/smell sensitivity <15; movement sensitivity <13; under-responsive/seeks sensation <27; auditory filtering <23; low energy/weak <26; and visual/auditory sensitivity <19 subscales. In our sample, the short sensory profile (SSP) has a good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α= 0.72–0.76 across scales).",84b210e0-c0e2-4ac6-84fe-820671db6b31
3,methods3,"  The adherence to the MD was assessed using the Mediterranean diet quality index for children and adolescents (KIDMED) [32]. The KIDMED index is a 16-item questionnaire developed to evaluate dietary habits in children and youths aged 2–24 years. It ranges from 0 to 12 points; the scoring was computed as follows: the items denoting a negative connotation as regards the MD were assigned a value of −1, and a value of +1 was applied to those illustrating a positive aspect. To evaluate the adherence to the MD, the sum of the values of the KIDMED index were divided into tertiles: first tertile (0–7 points), low adherence; second tertile (8 points), medium adherence; third tertile (9–12 points), high adherence.   In this study, other information about children and parental characteristics was also collected.",2988c61b-e652-4e6f-b56f-917dcc0d7865
4,methods4," To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence on determinants affecting sensory processing in typically developing children, although previous research has suggested that sensory processing impairment is common across children with neurodevelopmental disorders [33,34]. For the present analysis, based on prior knowledge about socio-demographic and lifestyle factors related to child neurodevelopmental outcomes from mother–child longitudinal studies, the following variables were considered as a priori potential confounding factors because of their possible associations with exposure and outcome: maternal and paternal characteristics such as age (in years), country of birth (Spain, other country), level of education (primary or less; secondary; university studies) and employment (yes; no), and child characteristics such as age (in years); sex (female; male); body mass index (calculated as parent-reported weight in kilograms divided by parent-reported height in meters squared),",fa35e767-3fa6-44e6-b553-57a939bd434a
5,methods5," sleep duration (in hours per day), sleep quality (good; poor) as measured by the Spanish version of the pediatric sleep questionnaire [35], TV watching (hours per day), and parent-reported physical activity (not active; moderately active; active/very active).  2.3. Statistical Analysis Descriptive analysis of sociodemographic and lifestyle of parents and their children participants in the study was performed using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, and median and interquartile range for continuous variables. To compare these characteristics between those children classified as a typical sensory profile (i.e., ≥155 points) and those with an atypical sensory profile (i.e., <155 points), we used Chi-square or Fisher’s exact for categorical variables, and U de Mann Whitney test for continuous variables.   The association between the adherence to the MD, using total score and score categories (i.e., low, medium and high), and sensory profile (i.e.",a343ef81-417b-4cc4-b5e6-7992198d00d0
6,methods6,", typical vs atypical performance), using the short sensory profile (SSP) total score and the score of each subscale, was analyzed by multiple Poisson regression models with robust variance based on the Huber sandwich estimate to obtain prevalence ratios (PR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) [36,37]. Furthermore, we replicated the same analysis for each component of the KIDMED index. A robust Poisson regression model was used instead of the log-binomial regression model due to it not converging [38].   Models were adjusted for potential confounders based on those factors previously identified in literature. Moreover, those variables with p-values <0.20 in the bivariate analysis and those whose magnitude of the effect for the exposure of interest changed by >10% following a backward elimination procedure were also included.",2b1b22d4-4b96-4065-b812-4f5764977df4
7,methods7," We did not adjust for paternal variables and child body mass index due to the large number of missing values, although we conducted a further sensitivity analysis to explore the possible influence of these variables as potential confounders. Finally, all models were adjusted for the following child’s characteristics: sex, age, sleep quality, and television watching; and for maternal age, educational level, and country of birth.  To assess the possible effect of dose-response in the categories of the adherence to the MD, linear tests were applied for the KIDMED score as continuous variable (low, medium, and high, coded 1–3).  Several sensitivity analyses were also conducted to evaluate the robustness of the main findings. First, to examine the likely influence of sex and age, we performed stratified analyses by the child’s sex and age group.",9afca007-ea0a-45b2-86e9-c524bbab39bb
8,methods8," Moreover, taking into account the potential role of several conditions in sensory performance, we observed the effect of the complete model after excluding those children born preterm (<37 weeks of gestation; n = 66), with low birthweight (<2500 g; n = 56), and children with some diseases (n = 45). The father’s education level and country of origin and the child’s body mass index were also added to the complete model to weigh their possible effect on the findings obtained. Regarding the atypical sensory processing, stratified models by those children classified under probable difference and by those under definite difference for the analyzed short sensory profile (SSP) subscales were carried out. According to the sensory profile categories defined by Dunn [29], children with probable difference in sensory processing were classified as follows: tactile sensitivity 29–27; taste/smell sensitivity 14–12; and low energy/weak 25–24.",64b2ddcc-2083-4bf4-ad35-ecd180bfcda2
9,methods9," Children with a definite difference in sensory processing were considered as follows: tactile sensitivity ≤26; taste/smell sensitivity ≤11; and low energy/weak ≤23. Statistical analyses were conducted with software R, version 3.5.1 (R Core Team. R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; http://www.r-project.org). The applied statistical tests were bilateral and significance was established at 0.05.   3. Results 3.1. Demographic and Lifestyle of Maternal, Parternal, and Child’s Characteristics In our study, the prevalence of atypical sensory performance in children aged 3–7 was 29.8% (short sensory profile (SSP) total score <155); 11.5% (tactile sensitivity <30); 15.3% (taste/smell sensitivity <15); 22.8% (movement sensitivity <13); 49.1% (under-responsive/seeks sensation <27); 44.4% (auditory filtering <23); 12.3% (low energy/weak <26); and 26.1% (visual/auditory sensitivity <19).",f3164039-a625-44b5-a6f9-cbcff6426a59
10,methods10," The characteristics of the participants included in the study were described in Table 1. With respect to parental features, the median age was around 40 years (38 for the mothers, and 40 for the fathers). More than 80% of parents were Spanish and slightly higher than a third (40.8% of the mothers and 33.1% of the fathers) had university studies. Almost 90% of the fathers reported to be employed while around 30% of the mothers were unemployed. However, mother’s age and employment, and the country of origin and education level of both parents showed statistically significant differences according to the sensory profile of their children. Compared to children with typical sensory performance, children classified as having atypical sensory processing were more likely to have a younger mother and be unemployed, have parents from a foreign country and with non-university studies. Regarding children’s traits, the median age was 5 years and the distribution of boys (50.6%) and girls (49.",9df97299-a90d-4049-bdf0-483ab542e1b4
11,methods11,"4%) was almost equal in proportion. Overall, children slept a median of 10 h/day, 10.3% had poor sleep quality, spent a median of 2 h/day watching TV, and 61.4% were physically active/very active. However, sex, sleep quality, TV watching, and physical activity indicated statistically significant differences between sensory processing groups. Children with atypical sensory performance were more likely to be male, have a poor sleep quality, spend more time watching TV, and be physically active or very active, in comparison to those children presenting typical sensory performance.  3.2. Association Between Adherence to Mediterranean Diet and Prevalence of Atypical Sensory Processing The median adherence to the MD was 8 points, 276 (47.3%), 117 (20.1%), and 190 (32.6%) of children were classified as having low, medium, and high adherence, respectively.",3e8c815a-8510-47bd-9564-e697d60ac65a
12,methods12," Table 2 presents prevalence rates of atypical sensory processing for short sensory profile (SSP) total and subscale scores, as well as the results of the association between the adherence to the MD and the prevalence of atypical sensory processing after adjusting for potential confounders. In general, children who had low adherence to the MD presented the higher rates of atypical sensory processing for short sensory profile (SSP) total and subscale scores, although children who had medium or high adherence to the MD displayed very similar prevalence rates. Compared with children who had low adherence to the MD, we observed that children who had a medium or high adherence to the MD presented a statistically significant lower prevalence ratio (PR) of atypical tactile sensitivity (PR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.25; 0.99; PR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.34; 0.99, respectively), although the association did not show a linear trend effect (p-trend = 0.122).",cd43b099-8428-449f-951a-d2f479d46d09
13,methods13," A statistically significant lower PR of atypical taste/smell sensitivity was also observed in children who had medium (PR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.33; 0.99) or high (PR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.19; 0.60) adherence to the MD, in comparison with those who had low adherence. This association was verified as a strong dose–response relationship (p-trend = 0.372 × 10−3). Among the remaining short sensory profile (SSP) subscales, only children who had medium adherence to the MD were less likely to present low energy/weak difficulties (PR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.16; 0.83), compared with those having low adherence. Moreover, when we explored the association per two-point increase in KIDMED score, the protective effect against the prevalence of atypical sensory processing remained statistically significant for taste/smell sensitivity (PR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.59; 0.85) and low energy and weak (PR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.64; 0.99) subscales.",9a1c42c6-eb5c-43e4-b99d-ff2750c9e046
14,methods14," Although the association was not statistically significant, a clear positive tendency was also observed between an increment in the adherence to the MD and the short sensory profile (SSP) total score (PR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80; 1.02) and tactile sensitivity (PR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.64; 1.02). Nevertheless, a positive effect of a higher adherence to the MD on the rest of the short sensory profile (SSP) subscales was generally evident, although the statistical significance was not reached.  3.3. Association between Components of KIDMED Index and Atypical Sensory Processing Table 3 shows the findings of the association between each component of adherence to the MD as measured by the KIDMED index and the prevalence of atypical sensory processing in the short sensory profile (SSP) tactile sensitivity, taste/smell sensitivity, and low energy and weak subscales. The estimates showed that children with atypical tactile sensitivity were less likely to have vegetables regularly once a day (PR = 1.",69eb6e46-42dc-4ad5-8343-7cd032d1ac94
15,methods16,"93), compared with those children having typical sensory processing. Moreover, children classified as having atypical sensory processing in the low energy/weak subscale were less likely to have fresh or cooked vegetables regularly once a day (PR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.09; 2.46) and use olive oil at home (PR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.06; 3.63), compared with those children who presented a typical sensory performance.   3.4. Sensitivity Analyses Several sensitivity analyses were carried out in order to appraise the robustness of our findings (Table 4). The estimates for tactile sensitivity did not notably change, excepting when we explored the effect only in girls (PR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.32; 0.80) and, to a lesser extent, when children with poor sleep quality (PR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.58; 0.94) were excluded from the analysis.",f9e64468-b240-47ed-ba1a-fe3eff0651d0
16,methods17," The association observed between a two-point increase in adherence to the MD and lower PR of atypical taste/smell sensitivity remained significant and similar in all sensitivity analyses, except when only children aged 5 (PR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.62; 1.14) and those aged 6–7 (PR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.55; 1.11) were included, and when those who had poor sleep quality (PR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.66; 1.46) were excluded, as well as when we only accounted for those children who were classified as having definite atypical sensory processing (PR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.70; 1.09). By contrast, we observed that the magnitude of the positive effect was higher and statistically significant when including only children aged 3–4 (PR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.40; 0.73) and those identified as having probable atypical sensory processing (PR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.37; 0.61). The analyses for low energy/weak subscale did not indicate any substantial change overall, although the estimates did not reach statistical significance.",4270af5e-7765-4759-804f-2a60f1f3b26a
17,methods18," However, we observed a notable attenuation of the main effect, but not significant, when including only children aged 3–4 (PR =1.02, 95% CI: 0.69; 1.50), as well as those children who were classified as having definite atypical sensory processing (PR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.74; 1.46). On the contrary, the association observed was positively reinforced when including only children aged 6–7 (PR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46; 0.86) and those identified as having probable atypical sensory processing (PR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.47; 0.83).   4. Discussion In this study, including Spanish children aged 3–7 years, we observed that around a third of children were identified as having atypical sensory performance according to the short sensory profile (SSP) total score.",83a750ab-3c87-413c-8323-a3a4a2f1d7ba
18,methods19," Although the prevalence of atypical sensory performance differed between the short sensory profile (SSP) subscales, it should be noted that at least one in nine children presented some difficulty in sensory processing, affecting almost half of children with respect to certain sensory domains. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, our findings showed that a higher adherence to the MD was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of atypical performance in short sensory profile (SSP) tactile and taste/smell sensitivity and low energy/weak subscales. A lower intake of vegetables and no use of olive oil at home were associated with sensory difficulties as measured by these three short sensory profile (SSP) subscales. A lower consumption of cereals or grains for breakfast was also related to atypical tactile sensitivity. A lower intake of fruit or fruit juice, fish, pulses, but regular eating of nuts was associated with having atypical taste/smell sensitivity.",fbd0f5ad-3578-45e3-92af-d16e225f2156
19,methods20," To our knowledge, this is the first general population-based study that shows that a greater adherence to the MD may be linked to a lower prevalence of sensory processing difficulties in school-aged children.   Our preliminary hypothesis was that children with atypical sensory processing would present a lower adherence to the MD, compared to children with typical sensory profile. Indeed, we found that the larger rates of prevalence of atypical sensory performance in the short sensory profile (SSP) total score and nearly all the short sensory profile (SSP) subscales were observed in children classified as having low adherence to the MD. Since the quality of children’s diet in developed countries constitutes a serious health concern [39], it is important to identify factors that may have an influence on eating behaviors in early life.",f2a8bfed-e172-44be-bd72-1c950b3a26e5
20,methods21," Previous research has reported that feeding difficulties are very common problems in childhood and are associated with negative effects on dietary intake and dietary variety [14]. Thus, in order to have a better understanding of these early feeding difficulties, and tailor strategies accordingly, alternative approaches based on sensory evaluation have gained broad acceptance among researchers. The interest in sensory processing problems stems for the fact that the process of eating involves integration of sensory domains, differing between individuals with respect to sensitivity to the different properties of food, such as its taste or texture [40,41]. Currently, there is incipient evidence suggesting a connection between sensory processing difficulties and poor eating behaviors [42].",2afb1f91-9abd-41a5-a403-23bcc81e1878
21,methods22,"   Consistent with our findings, few studies showed that eating less fruits and vegetables was associated with sensitivity in tactile and taste/smell domains [22,40,43], but not in the domain of low energy/weak. Although evidence is still insufficient, this later finding may be of particular interest to open new lines of research. The likely explanations accepted so far about the relationship between sensory processing and problematic eating behaviors have been given in terms of acceptance or rejection of foods. In this sense, sensory processing has been postulated as an important contributor to food acceptance [42] due to sensory properties of foods such as tactile, visual, taste, and olfactory characteristics. As far as we know, two previous studies conducted in Spanish children have reported that food neophobia, i.e.",8311186a-1a03-4f70-8e8b-32ce093b08e4
22,methods23,", reluctance to eat, or avoidance of new foods, was associated with a lower adherence to the MD [44,45], indicating that these children had a poorer dietary quality and less balanced diets. Thus, in connection with the main hypothesis, it may be assumed that a lower adherence to the MD could be related to a poorer health status. As such, the results observed in the domain of low energy/weak draw the attention to the potential impact of the dietary quality on sensory processing. However, the cross-sectional design of this study does not allow us to establish a cause–effect relationship, although it should be noted that our sample population is representative of the general population and the results obtained may be helpful to generate hypothesis that can be further tested via prospective study designs.   To date, there has been no research that has explored the association between sensory processing and dietary quality.",f07e2e13-b82d-4885-acdf-cd953c53b2b7
23,methods24," In the present study, we aimed at determining the dietary quality as measured by the adherence to the MD in children in order to assess its effect on the prevalence of atypical sensory performance. Extensive literature has documented that the MD is a dietary pattern that plays a substantial role in the prevention against a wide range of health outcomes, largely due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity derived from a great intake of plant foods, fish, and higher use of olive oil [1]. In this regard, our results also supported that the potential protective effect of the MD on sensory processing problems could mainly be attributed to specific foods such as fruits, vegetables, fish, cereals, pulses, and use of olive oil.",8c32774e-ad8c-48e9-96fd-5fa2c4c3db65
24,methods25," Nevertheless, strong evidence has reported that the more beneficial effects of the MD lie in the synergistic combination of dietary components of this pattern considered as a whole, resulting in a balanced ratio of n-6 and n-3 essential fatty acids, high oleic acid content, and great amounts of dietary fiber, antioxidants, and polyphenols [46]. Importantly, this may be of particular interest to define strategies to improve the dietary quality in children, suggesting that nutritional interventions based on a MD pattern may be a more suitable option than interventions focused on the increment of only certain foods. In this study, we observed a positive effect of the global diet as measured by adherence to the MD on child sensory outcomes. An increase in the adherence to the MD was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of sensory difficulties in taste/smell sensitivity and low energy/weak domain.",3f13218c-aed9-474d-9895-78f14b30a775
25,methods26," In general, a protection against the prevalence of atypical sensory processing as measured by the short sensory profile (SSP) total score and some short sensory profile (SSP) subscale scores was also shown, although the statistical association was not significant because of, to a large extent, the lack of statistical power.  This study has several shortcomings that should be considered for the interpretation of the findings. Since all data were self-reported, there could be some misclassification, although any inaccuracy in reporting should be non-differential. In addition, the questionnaires used to collect information from the study participants were valid and reliable instruments employed in previous research. The cross-sectional analysis of our data prevents us from establishing a causal link between adherence to the MD and sensory processing; however, they do constitute a suitable rationale for replicating in other samples using a prospective study design.",67ccf696-9743-4904-b027-2f27d44981dc
26,methods27," Moreover, it should be noted that our sample was collected from the general population and randomly selected in order to preserve the representativeness of data. Nevertheless, the results obtained require corroborating in larger samples.  We are aware that our data are far from being able to provide a possible explanation by which higher adherence to the MD may protect against the prevalence of sensory processing difficulties in school-aged children. We adjusted for a wide range of potential confounding factors, although the effect of unknown factors, residual confounding, or bias due to information not collected cannot be disregarded. Finally, we evaluated the robustness of the findings accounting for specific conditions that could interfere or be related to child sensory processing performing several sensitivity analyses.  5. Conclusions This study shows the potential positive effect of a higher adherence to the MD on sensory performance (i.e.",150b1e68-2eb2-4c3a-966f-211893e3adec

These findings add to other evidence supporting the possible beneficial effect of the MD on child health outcomes. The positive association between a higher adherence to the MD and sensory performance was observed in short sensory profile (SSP) tactile and taste/smell sensitivity and low energy/weak subscales. This was more evident in taste/smell sensitivity and low energy/weak subscales when exploring the effect as a linear relationship and was notably stronger in taste/smell sensitivity, unlike the rest of short sensory profile (SSP) subscales. Compared to children with typical sensory performance, children with difficulties in tactile and taste/smell sensitivity and low energy/weak domain presented lower intakes of Mediterranean foods such as vegetables, fruits, fish, pulses, cereals, and olive oil.",8f6e88a2-9857-4342-88d5-90a29ded2501
28,methods29," Nevertheless, our results should be confirmed in further prospective studies; in the meantime, efforts to improve dietary quality in early childhood should incorporate, in line with the whole diet approach for the MD, intervention strategies aimed at promoting the MD food pattern.
