0,introduction0,"Population ageing has fostered the general concern for obtaining a better health-related quality of life (health related quality of life (HRQL)). health related quality of life (HRQL) is a multidimensional concept that refers to the physical, psychological and social domains of health [1]. Each of these domains has different components to be measured and they can represent both an objective (functioning and health status) and subjective (perceptions) dimension of health. The measuring of health related quality of life (HRQL) has been frequently applied to patients but it is also interesting to assess it among healthy subjects. Several factors are well-known determinants of health related quality of life (HRQL) [2]–[4], some of them are related to lifestyle, and therefore they are modifiable. Among them, dietary habits are especially interesting. Beyond isolated food items, the assessment of overall dietary patterns is likely to provide a better explanation of diet-health associations.",67397181-e737-4862-8517-edc059c0642c
1,introduction1,"  The application of dietary patterns has become of considerable interest in nutritional epidemiology [5], [6]. The idea that persons do not consume isolated foods or nutrients but include them in a varied overall dietary pattern and that food and nutrients can have synergistic or antagonistic effects when they are consumed together has had a growing acceptance in nutritional epidemiology during the last decade. The effect of an isolated nutrient could be too small as to be able to be detected, whereas the cumulative effect of multiple nutrients included in an overall dietary pattern can be sufficiently large as to exhibit sizable health effects. On the other hand, the close correlation between some nutrients could complicate to study them as separate entities. In addition, if the intake of several nutrients is associated with some dietary patterns, the analysis of an isolated nutrient could be biased by the effect of the overall dietary pattern.",9500f9b7-f5c9-45aa-85f2-1ef4c0f4f377
2,introduction2,"  The scientific literature has consistently shown the effects of certain diets on health. The deleterious effects of a “Western-type” [7]–[9] and the benefits of a traditional Mediterranean diet have been consistently described in many epidemiological studies [10]–[12]. However, few studies have analyzed the influence of diet on the quality of life of healthy populations [13], [14]. In a recent report from our cohort we have shown that the adherence to a Mediterranean Diet assessed by an a priori approach (Hypothesis-oriented food pattern) was associated with better scores in self-perceived quality of life [15]. Our results were in accordance with another study also conducted in Spain which showed the same beneficial effects of the adherence to this dietary pattern on quality of life [16].  However, an alternative approach to ascertain dietary patterns is the use of principal component analysis to obtain empirically-derived patterns (a posteriori approach).",686acd03-00c9-4b48-a163-968325e1183c
3,introduction3," This alternative has been shown to be a powerful method for summarizing nutrient and food intake to depict the whole diet and it also has the advantage of reflecting existing food habits in the study population. Moreover, the results can be easily translated into public health recommendations [5], [17].  Thus, the purpose of the present study was to assess the association between baseline adherence to empirically-derived dietary patterns and self perceived physical and mental health related quality of life (HRQL) collected after 4-year follow up in the SUN cohort.

4,methods0,"Study population The “Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra’’ (SUN) Project is an ongoing, multipurpose, dynamic cohort of university graduates conducted in Spain and started in December 1999. The study methods and the cohort profile have been published in detail elsewhere [18], [19].  For this analysis, we included participants who had already been followed-up for at least 4 years (n  = 15,799). Among them, 12,623 were successfully followed-up for at least 4 years. We excluded those participants who were outside of predefined limits for total energy intake (<800 kcal/d in men and <500 kcal/d in women or >4000 kcal/d in men and >3500 kcal/d in women) (n = 1,194) [20], and participants without or with incorrect data regarding quality of life (n = 301).

5,methods1," The study was approved by the Human Research Ethical Committee at the University of Navarra. Voluntary completion of the first questionnaire was considered to imply informed consent and our Committee specifically approved this consent process.  Exposure assessment Dietary intake was assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (136 food items) completed at baseline [21]. Validity and reproducibility of this questionnaire has recently been re-evaluated [22], [23]. For example, it showed reasonably good validity for assessing the different food groups (intraclass correlation coefficients versus four 3-day food records ranged from 0.40 to 0.84).  A trained dietician updated the nutrient data bank using the latest available information from the food composition table for Spain [24], [25]. The 136 food items included in the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire were classified in 20 predefined food groups (Table 1).",5d1ed051-69f8-441d-8925-e5a667ef117a
6,methods2," The grouping scheme was based on the similarity of nutrients profile or culinary usage among the foods and was somewhat similar to that used in other studies [26]. A principal component analysis was applied to these groups in order to identify a reduced number of factors that could explain the maximum proportion of the variance from the original groups [27]. The factors were rotated by Varimax orthogonal transformation to achieve a simpler structure with greater interpretability. In determining the numbers of factor to retain, we considered the Scree test [28], and the interpretability of the factors.  10.1371/journal.pone.0061490.t001Table 1 Food groupings used in the dietary pattern.",01dd2d0f-60da-4e4c-803e-880604f38286

10,methods6,"  Outcome assessment Quality of life was assessed after the 4-year follow-up with the validated Spanish version of the SF-36 Health Survey. The SF-36 is a general health scale widely used and thoroughly validated [29]. This instrument has been translated into a number of languages, including Spanish. The Spanish weights obtained were very similar to those of the original American version (correlation coefficients >0.9) [30]. The questionnaire contains 36 items which measure eight multi-item domains of health status: 1) physical functioning, 2) role limitations due to physical health problems (role-physical), 3) bodily pain, 4) general health perceptions, 5) vitality, 6) social functioning, 7) role limitations due to emotional problems (role emotional) and 8) mental health. Domains 1 to 4 of the questionnaire deal with physical aspects, while domains 5 to 8 measure psychological features.",b9efc166-5cd7-49b2-9a42-8fc32013f659
11,methods7," For each parameter, scores were coded, summed and transformed to a scale from 0 (the worst possible condition) to 100 (the best possible condition). In the case of the bodily pain domain a score of 100 means a complete tolerance or absence of pain.  The raw domain scores were standardized and aggregated into two summary measures: Mental Summary Component, summarizing the 4 mental domains, and Physical Summary Component, summarizing the 4 physical domains [30].  Covariate assessment The baseline assessment also gathered information on socio-demographic variables, anthropometric variables, lifestyle and health-related habits, and medical history [19]. Self-reported anthropometric variables were previously validated in a subsample of the cohort [31].  At baseline, participants also completed a validated physical activity questionnaire that collects information about 17 activities [32].",01e64a21-db92-4c7d-be45-94ccfdd65abf
12,methods8," Leisure-time activities were computed by assigning an activity metabolic equivalent (metabolic equivalent (MET)) score to each activity, multiplied by the time spent in each activity and summing up all activities [33].  Statistics Generalized Linear Models were used to assess the relationship between quintiles of adherence to both dietary patterns and the different domains of the SF- 36. We estimated multivariable-adjusted means and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each quintile. To ascertain if these means were significantly different by pairs, a post hoc correction for multiple testing was used (Benjamini-Hochberg procedure).  We also estimated the regression coefficients (95% CI) of the mental and physical summary components for the four upper quintiles using the lowest quintile as the reference category.",e6bbb6c9-ec5f-4b6d-90c8-54454624131a
13,methods9," Potential confounders included as covariates in the models were: age (years, continuous), sex, smoking (never, past and current smokers), physical activity during leisure time (metabolic equivalent (MET)S-h/week, quintiles), total energy intake (Kcal/day, continuous), BMI (kg/m2, continuous), and prevalence of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)), diabetes, dyslipidaemia and hypertension at baseline. Additionally, tests of linear trend across successive quintiles of adherence were conducted assigning the median value to each quintile category and treating the variable as continuous.  Differences in the eight parameters of the SF-36 according to the level of adherence to the dietary patterns can be assessed along two concepts: clinical and statistical differences. Clinically significant differences are defined as a 5-point difference in the 0–100 scale [34], whereas statistically significant differences were defined as 2-tailed p<0.05.",14db9d6d-1488-4de4-b69a-53c34281bcc1
14,methods10,"  Finally, several sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess possible sources of bias in the estimation of the association between adherence to the WPS or the MPS and the SF-36 health domains. We repeated the analyses after: 1) adopting different allowed limits for total energy intake, 2) excluding participants with cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and cancer at baseline, 3) additionally adjusting for socio-economic variables: years of education, marital status and employment status, 4) adjusting for alcohol intake, 5) repeating the factor analysis including 25 predefined food groups or 30 predefined food groups.

15,results0,"Factor analysis revealed two major dietary patterns accounting for 14.1% of the total variance. The first dietary pattern could typify a Western dietary pattern (Western dietary pattern (WDP)). This pattern was characterized by high consumption of fast food, red and processed meats, high-fat dairy products, processed foods, refined cereals, eggs, commercial bakery goods, and sauces. The second dietary pattern was labelled as “Mediterranean dietary pattern” (MDP) and was characterized by high consumption of vegetables, fish and other seafood, fruits, poultry, olive oil, potatoes, low-fat dairy products, and legumes.  Younger subjects, men, current smokers and those with higher total energy intake were more likely to belong to the highest quintile of adherence to the Western dietary pattern (WDP) (Table 3). In contrast, subjects in the highest quintile of adherence to MDP were more likely to be women, and more physically active.  10.1371/journal.pone.0061490.",0cb1e2d8-7a61-4e4e-9fa7-0c76cfac2ac7

Adherence to the Western dietary pattern (WDP) was associated with poorer scores in the 2 standardized summary measures of quality of life (the mental and the physical summary measures) and in all the 8 domains of the SF-36. On the contrary, adherence to the MDP was associated with higher quality of life scores in the mental summary component and in 4 of the 8 individual domains of the SF-36 (vitality, mental health, physical functioning and general health).  Dietary patterns derived with an a posteriori approach have been investigated in relation to many health outcomes [35], [36], but to our knowledge this is the first time that they have been related to quality of life.",59c4c4aa-f72e-43e4-b3a3-77e76816d8f6
23,discussion1," Although health related quality of life (HRQL) is a perceived health measure rather than a biological measure, self-related health status has been shown to be a powerful predictor of mortality in the long term [37].  Our results suggest that a dietary pattern characterized by frequent consumption of fast-food, red and processed meats, high-fat dairy, processed foods, eggs and commercial bakery seems to be deleterious for quality of life, whereas a dietary pattern rich in vegetables, fish, fruits, poultry and olive oil is directly associated with a better quality of life. Moreover, an adjusted difference of −3.5 points in the mean values of vitality was obtained when participants with the highest adherence to the Western dietary pattern (WDP) were compared to those with the lowest adherence. Similar absolute difference was observed as we compared participants in the extreme quintiles of adherence to the MDP.",4a0e3047-68c8-462c-9cf8-5527fb6794b2
24,discussion2,"  There is a debate on how to define clinically meaningful differences on the SF-36 scores. Changes in 3-, 5-, and 10- points have been suggested as being clinically meaningful for clinical populations [38]. Although few studies have examined this issue directly, several investigators have raised the question of whether individuals with more severe impairments in health related quality of life (HRQL) at baseline might require a greater absolute change in their quality of life in order to consider this improvement clinically meaningful than those with less severe impairments at baseline [34].  Our cohort included healthy and relatively young adults with good average quality of life. In this context it is difficult to find large differences because most participants perceive themselves in good health. But even in this setting we did find significant associations between dietary patterns and quality of life. It seems logical to think that in another context with worse quality of life (e.g.",e5570d79-60ab-434d-b3fa-fd6983cab7c8
25,discussion3," patients with a chronic disease) differences in quality of life related to dietary patterns could be expected to be even higher.  Scientific literature has consistently shown the deleterious effect of the Western dietary pattern (WDP), a food pattern described in several large American cohort studies. Epidemiological studies have reported a detrimental effect on weight gain, obesity and insulin resistance [39], [40]. Moreover, this pattern has also been associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), endothelial dysfunction and higher level of pro-inflammatory cytokines [26], [41], [42]. The high content of saturated, trans-unsaturated fatty acids, and refined sugars usually present in the foods that characterize the Western diet are candidates to be the responsible agents for the reported associations [43].",26a9c574-8a9b-44f0-8fc3-c0f4b460c1f6
26,discussion4," The adverse effects of saturated, trans-unsaturated fats on cardiovascular disease (CVD) are thought to be mediated by increases in plasma concentrations of LDL-cholesterol, reductions in HDL-cholesterol, pro-inflammatory changes, endothelial dysfunction, and possibly by insulin resistance and displacement of essential fatty acids from membranes [44], [45]. On the other hand, few epidemiological studies have addressed the long-term health impact of dietary patterns characterized also with high-sugar foods like the Western dietary pattern (WDP), but diets with low glycemic load have been associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease, [46] lower level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a better lipid profile [47].  With regard to mental quality of life, several studies have associated the adherence to a Western-style dietary pattern high in fats and refined sugars to a higher risk of depression and anxiety or to the presence of mental symptoms [48], [49].",1e5f9a08-6200-40db-882a-7982143a8446
27,discussion5," A possible explanation for this finding is that the Western dietary pattern could decrease the levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) within a short period of time as some animal studies have shown [50]. In fact, the Western dietary pattern is able to increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that inhibit the production of this neurothophin. brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a crucial mediator of neuronal vitality and function [51]. Therefore, it is likely that a dietary pattern rich in commercial bakery, sugary beverages and fast-food could increase the vulnerability to some mental or neurological disorders or act negatively on mental quality of life. All of these physiological processes may also be influencing physical and mental quality of life in healthy populations.",7be30f88-96a3-49fe-a677-f7aba89b2f3f
28,discussion6,"  Contrarily to the Western dietary pattern (WDP), the adherence to a traditional MDP has been inversely associated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity or the metabolic syndrome [52], [53]. The Mediterranean Diet is rich in nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, fibre, omega-3 fatty acids (from fish) and monounsaturated fatty acids (from olive oil) whose beneficial effects on health have been widely demonstrated [54]. Several biological and physiological mechanisms could explain the beneficial effect of the MDP on physical health. A greater adherence to a MDP has been inversely associated with a reduction in low-grade inflammatory status, better endothelial function and lower insulin resistance [41], [55], [56]. All these factors are thought to lead not only to a lower risk of chronic diseases, but also to a better metabolic control of already established diseases.",6f63a154-b991-4473-a9c1-7538cc87e972
29,discussion7," Furthermore, this dietary pattern has also been related with a better mental health status. Several studies have reported a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases, depression or mental disorders among subjects with a better adherence to the traditional MDP [10], [57]. Some biological mechanisms to explain this association are based on the role that long chain omega-3 fatty acids are thought to play in the central nervous system, including the dynamic structure and fluidity of neural membrane and beneficial influences on serotonin transport [58]. On the other hand B vitamins and folate are involved in 1-carbon metabolism that acts in several methylation reactions, such as those related to the synthesis of serotonin and other monoamine neurotransmitters [59].  Several limitations in our study need to be addressed.",0f1e3d34-6a02-453d-af1f-511ac610cdbe
30,discussion8," Although the validity and reliability of the food-frequency questionnaire have been extensively evaluated, as well as the validity of the SF-36 questionnaire, some degree of misclassification may exist in the dietary and in the outcome assessment and over- or under-estimation of true intake and health status could have biased our estimates. However, being the miss-classification most probably non-differential, the bias would be probably towards the null. Therefore, we do not believe that misclassification might be an alternative explanation of the significant associations we identified. On the other hand, diet was ascertained at baseline and quality of life after 4-years of follow-up. Therefore we acknowledge that baseline scores of quality of life were unknown. It could be possible to speculate that a high quality of life at baseline might lead to a better general situation with healthier life-style including the adoption of healthier food habits.",5e65a4b7-5b10-48d5-b14e-8d0648b0055d
31,discussion9," Thus, the effect exerted for both dietary patterns on health related quality of life (HRQL) could be in part due to better/worse baseline physical and mental health status. In any case, we have adjusted for a wide array of baseline characteristics that could be considered markers of quality of life such as smoking, physical activity, energy intake, body size or medical history of chronic diseases [60]–[62]. Thus, we have probably reduced the baseline heterogeneity among participants.  Dietary patterns were constructed only at baseline, so changes in dietary patterns during the follow-up period were not considered. Further studies are needed to complete this assessment using repeated measurements of diet.  Also, it is generally accepted that socio-economic status influences dietary habits as well as human health. However, the participants in our cohort were restricted to university graduates (responsible, highly motivated, and many of them former students of a private university).",56626a26-e5dc-4835-a290-ce6f568ed980
32,discussion10," So, we consider that the sample is fairly homogeneous regarding socio-economic status (medium-high). Moreover, restriction is an excellent technique for preventing or at least reducing confounding by known factors, and it is recommended by methodologists because restriction is usually more effective than multivariable adjustment to control for potential confounding [63]. Finally, our results did not change after the adjustment for several socioeconomic factors such as years of education, employment status or marital status in our sensitivity analyses.  Another fact to take into account is that quality of life is a complex concept with various dimensions. Nevertheless, the use of the SF-36 questionnaire for evaluating the physical and mental dimensions of quality of life is generally accepted, and its validity and reliability have been demonstrated in many population-based studies [64], including the validated version translated into Spanish [65].",81c88c62-2f62-432f-ad82-019c8a3beee3
33,discussion11,"  Some strengths of our study also deserve to be mentioned. They include its large sample size, its long-term follow-up, the multiple adjustments of our estimates for a variety of major potential confounders and the existence of published validation studies of our assessments.  Conclusions Self-perceived mental and physical quality of life was inversely associated with the adherence to a Western dietary pattern (WDP), and directly associated with the adherence to a MDP.
