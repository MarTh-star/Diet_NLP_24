Sampling Procedure at Baseline Examination  The ATTICA study is a prospective population-based study conducted in the greater metropolitan area of Athens in Greece, including 78% urban and 22% rural population. The baseline examination of the study was carried out during 2001–2002 [20]. The sampling procedure anticipated enrolling only one participant per household; it was random, multistage and based on the age and gender distribution of the Attica region (census of 2001). Of the 4056 invited individuals at baseline examination, 3042 agreed to participate (75% participation rate); 1514 of the participants were men (18–87 years) and 1528 were female (18–89 years). All participants were interviewed and examined by trained personnel (cardiologists, general practitioners, dietitians and nurses) who used a standard questionnaire [20].",2b0b69bd-4602-4ba3-b1d7-de367a3f4afc

The examination was performed in the individuals’ homes or workplaces.  2.2. Baseline Measurements  Demographics and Lifestyle  The baseline evaluation included information about demographic characteristics (age, gender), personal and family history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, family history of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), dietary and other lifestyle habits (i.e., smoking status and physical activity). In the present analysis, current smoking was defined as any use of tobacco or smoke during the last year.",a227d1f6-ff21-48f4-b42f-090e1b0bcfbb
2,methods2," For the ascertainment of physical activity status, the international physical activity questionnaire was used (international physical activity questionnaire was used (IPAQ)) [21], as an index of weekly energy expenditure using frequency (times per week), duration (in minutes per time) and intensity of sports or other habits related to physical activity (in expended calories per time). Participants who did not report any physical activities were defined as physically inactive. Waist circumference was measured in the middle between the lowest rib and the iliac crest using an inelastic measuring tape to the nearest 0.5 cm, while waist to hip ratio was also calculated. Body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight (in kilograms) divided by standing height (in meters squared). Obesity was defined as Body mass index (BMI) greater than 29.9 kg/m2.  2.3.",bc3e1339-a25a-4da4-a923-ffb5c560d13e
3,methods3," Dietary Assessment  Dietary intake was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) [22], the EPIC-Greek questionnaire that was kindly provided by the Unit of Nutrition of Athens Medical School. This food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) collected information for the whole year before the enrolment, including several seasonal foods as well [22]. Participants were asked if they had recently changed their diet, and whether they had received any interventions regarding their diet. Ethanol intake in a typical day was calculated using the same food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated using an 11-item, composite index, the MedDietScore (range 0–55) [23].

For the consumption of foods presumed not to be part of the Mediterranean pattern (i.e., consumption of meat and meat products, poultry and full-fat dairy products), scores are assigned on a reverse scale. For alcohol, score 5 is assigned for consumption of less than 3 wine glasses per day, score 0 for consumption of more than 7 wineglasses per day and scores from 4 to 1 for consumption of 3, 4–5, 6 and 7 or 0 wineglasses per day, respectively. The theoretical range of the MedDietScore was 0–55 and higher values of this diet score indicate greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet.",bb54c790-de90-4745-8217-1c7f1e937e23

Clinical Assessment  Arterial blood pressure (3 recordings) was measured at the end of the baseline physical examination in a sitting position after resting for at least 30 min. Participants whose average blood pressure levels were greater or equal to 140/90 mmHg or who were using antihypertensive medication were classified as having hypertension. Blood samples were collected from the antecubital vein between 8 and 10 a.m., in a sitting position after 12 h of fasting and alcohol abstinence. Total serum cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were measured using chromatographic enzymic method in a Technicon automatic analyser RA-1000 (Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany). Hypercholesterolemia was defined as total cholesterol levels greater than 200 mg/dL or the use of lipid-lowering agents.",bc51a4ec-6e84-4734-b76b-d1f92f9a022e

Diabetes mellitus (type 2) was defined according to the American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria (i.e., blood glucose levels greater than 125 mg/dL classified participants as having diabetes). High-sensitivity C reactive protein (CRP) was assayed by particle-enhanced immunonephelometry (N Latex, Dade-Behring Marburg GmbH, Marburg, Germany) with a range from 0.175 to 1100 mg/dL. g-GT but also blood lipids were measured by using chromatographic enzymic method in an automatic analyser (RA-1000, Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany).  2.5.",51f3dc3d-f4cb-4511-b0a7-277e56976c26
7,methods7," Definition of the Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD))  Fatty Liver Index  Fatty liver index (fatty liver index (FLI)), a non-invasive and useful surrogate marker for Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in the general population (10), was employed in this study to identify the likely presence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) at baseline. The fatty liver index (FLI) produces a score between 0 and 100 and a cut off <30 (negative likelihood ratio = 0.2) was used to rule out the presence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) or ≥60 (positive likelihood ratio = 4.3) was used to deem the likely presence of hepatic steatosis [26]. The fatty liver index (FLI) was calculated using the following algorithm:fatty liver index (FLI) = (e 0.953 × loge (triglycerides) + 0.139 × Body mass index (BMI) + 0.718 × loge (GGT) + 0.053 × waist circumference − 15.745)/(1 + e 0.953 × loge (triglycerides) + 0.139 × Body mass index (BMI) + 0.",58ab6c77-34f6-47df-9aaa-5209716eb89c

Follow-Up Examination (2011–2012)  During 2011-2012, the ATTICA study’s investigators performed the 10-year follow-up (mean follow-up time 8.41 years) [27]. All n = 3042 initially enrolled participants were contacted through telephone calls. Of those, there were n = 2583 who participated in the follow-up (85% participation rate) and investigators performed detailed evaluation of their medical records. Regarding Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) evaluation at follow-up, clinically accurate data were obtained from n = 2020 participants. Of the individuals that were lost to follow-up (i.e., n = 459), n = 224 were not found because of missing or wrong addresses and telephone numbers that they provided at baseline examination and n = 235 because they denied being re-examined. Mean age at baseline (±SD) was 45 ± 14 year for females and 46 ± 14 years for males (no difference with the overall baseline sample).",deb93fc8-a2aa-4a96-9909-7f3f8eb6520e

Analytical Sample  Participants that were either lost to follow-up or whose 10-year clinical data could not be validated were excluded from the analysis. With respect to participants with other known pre-existing causes of liver disease including viral hepatitis, they were excluded from the ATTICA study, alongside excluding participants with other chronic conditions.",de0e2783-8395-4a18-b2a9-357e54ec1325
10,methods10," Participants with any missing data for any of the values required to calculate fatty liver index (FLI) (Body mass index (BMI), triglycerides, GGT, waist circumference) were excluded from the working sample. Based on Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) definition, excessive alcohol consumption was an exclusion criterion to ensure liver disease was non-alcoholic; thus, females consuming >20 g of ethanol/day and males consuming >30 g of ethanol/day were excluded from the analysis. Furthermore, participants with evidence of chronic inflammation including C reactive protein (CRP) levels above 10 mg/L were not included in the analytical sample (Figure 1). The analytical sample was compared to the overall sample of the ATTICA study and there were no important differences to suggest an introduction of reporting bias.  2.8.",b0e51fd2-dd3d-45ac-80f4-bd185a084bd0

Comparisons between mean values of normally distributed variables for those who developed any Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) event and the rest of the participants were performed using Student’s t-test, after controlling for equality of variances using the Levene’s test. Comparisons of continuous variables that did not follow the normal distribution were performed using the non-parametric U-test proposed by Mann and Whitney. For the cross-sectional analysis, the odds ratios (OR) for the association between adherence to Mediterranean diet and presence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) were derived from binary logistic regression models.",6418e3aa-b9d0-4591-b2a3-fe16c8717d17
13,methods13," For the longitudinal analysis, the relative risk and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of developing a Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) event during the 10-year period, according to the participants’ baseline characteristics, were estimated using binary logistic regression models. Confounding factors (i.e., gender, age, C reactive protein (CRP), smoking status, sedentary lifestyle and education level) were included in multivariable models based on their associations in previous literature [28,29] and after examining associations between potential confounders, diet and outcome. Interaction terms between age groups and gender with MedDietScore were tested in the models, due to previous literature suggesting higher adherence to Mediterranean diet among females and older individuals [30].",505abc40-7599-4d56-9777-22b86b86b645

The mean age of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)-free individuals was significantly lower than subjects with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) (47 ± 14.5 years vs. 53 ± 14.5 years, p < 0.001). The baseline characteristics of the participants with respect to the fatty liver index (FLI) groups are presented in Table 1.

Considering the cross-sectional association between adherence to Mediterranean diet and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), further analysis was performed to explore the long-term effect of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Mediterranean diet on 10-year Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk, when taken into account simultaneously. As presented in Table 3, Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and adherence to Mediterranean diet were separately and simultaneously associated with 10-year Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk.

Increased MedDietScore was a protective factor against 10-year Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk in univariable analysis (OR = 0.882, 95% CI: 0.843, 0.923), when adjusted for Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) at baseline (OR = 0.989, 95% CI: 0.847, 0.935) and in the fully adjusted model for age, gender, sedentary lifestyle, C reactive protein (CRP) levels, smoking status and education level (OR = 0.873 = 95% CI: 0.795, 0.959). A significant interaction term was found between age tertiles and MedDietScore (p = 0.001), which was also taken into account in the final model.  As shown in Figure 2, adherence to the Mediterranean diet as measured via MedDietScore was inversely associated with fatty liver index (FLI).",f90c4069-3830-4cf6-a3ea-a0a1e221f6bf
19,methods19," MedDietScore had a significant role on Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk that was independent and direct, whilst fatty liver index (FLI) was not directly associated with 10-year Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk in the same conceptual model but was associated with lower C reactive protein (CRP) levels. C reactive protein (CRP) levels were not directly associated with 10-year Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk and were not affected by MedDietScore.  4. Discussion  The present analysis suggests that higher adherence to Mediterranean diet (assessed via MedDietScore) is associated with lower likelihood for Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) presence at baseline (assessed using fatty liver index (FLI)). Additionally, the presence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) at baseline showed predictive functionality for cardiovascular events (Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)) in a 10-year follow up of a Greek cohort.",a93f2cd3-7524-490a-9bb3-266b775a1cd8
20,methods20," However, when both adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern and presence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) at baseline were taken into account, Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) lost its predictive utility for 10-year Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk, whilst Mediterranean diet remained significantly protective. This could suggest that adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern is associated with reduced odds of co-existing with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and may ameliorate the negative effects of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) on 10-year Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk. It was hypothesised that the potential mechanism driving any mediating effects of the Mediterranean diet on Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and subsequently Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk was inflammation.",41cc930a-192f-4db7-81f4-bc9dd7960f61
21,methods21," This study showed through a structural equation model that, although there was an association between Mediterranean diet and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), as well as Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and inflammation (using C reactive protein (CRP)), Mediterranean diet appeared to negate the effect of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) on 10-year Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk.  The positive role of Mediterranean dietary pattern on Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk has been well defined [31], and more recently its potential to prevent and manage the growing epidemic of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has been identified [32], with the European Liver Association including the Mediterranean diet as the recommended diet for management of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [18].",c60791cb-56f4-4145-b8ef-9913180559df
22,methods22," The Mediterranean dietary pattern and its association with longevity is also well established [33] and evidence from prospective cohorts highlighting the inverse relationship between a Mediterranean dietary pattern and risk of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) continues to grow [34]. It is thought that insulin resistance is one of the driving factors exacerbating type 2 diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) and there is evidence to suggest that Mediterranean diet may moderate this effect [12]. An understanding of the role of the Mediterranean diet and health has been facilitated by the development of a number of dietary indices and scoring systems [35], some of which have been effectively applied to dietary intakes in countries outside of the Mediterranean basin [36]. The proposed pathway describing how a Mediterranean dietary pattern might reduce the risk of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) has postulated a positive effect on reducing inflammation [31,37].",896bd037-94ad-46c7-8fa0-03c2464c6a27
23,methods23," This could also explain its potential effects seen in reducing the risk of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), as well as being of potential therapeutic benefit in managing Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). In clinical case reviews, individuals diagnosed with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) have been shown to have a lower adherence to a Mediterranean diet [38], and this has been supported by data suggesting the potential of a Mediterranean dietary pattern to moderate Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [19,39].  Despite the apparent connections between a Mediterranean dietary pattern, Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), this pathway has yet to be investigated in a longitudinal prospective cohort.",54c8dfd5-a78f-4261-9358-54b8feb30f6b
24,methods24," Consistent with previous research, data from this analysis of the ATTICA cohort demonstrated an association between Mediterranean diet score and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) outcome [27], and a potential role of inflammation explaining the pathology and potential moderation by dietary factors. However, the analysis herein shows that Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), a known independent risk factor for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) [40], was less predictive for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) when adherence to the Mediterranean diet was accounted for. This suggests that a Mediterranean dietary pattern has the potential to moderate the impact of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) on Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk.",60d21012-1dbb-4c39-a14c-14b5d6a58468
25,methods25," It is worthy to note that although adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern is inversely associated with the presence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in this cohort, there was a positive association between inflammatory marker (C reactive protein (CRP)) and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). This appeared to offer a consistent pathway linking the pathogenesis of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) to increased risk of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk factors and outcomes. However, this was not confirmed by the structural equation model. Although, only C reactive protein (CRP) was used as a surrogate for inflammation; thus, inclusion of alternative or several inflammatory markers may be a more robust way to further investigate this hypothesis.",10bc0539-c365-49bf-a887-18f119c71b74
26,methods26," An alternative mechanism to explain these results may be that insulin resistance exacerbates de novo lipogenesis, which manifests via inflammation and underpins the pathological process driving Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [41]. This is supported by the literature indicating that Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and IR are correlated and exacerbate the development of pre-diabetes and diabetes [42,43].  As well as predicting Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk, the effect of fatty liver index (FLI) on Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) appears to be moderated by increasing MedDietScore. This is supported by underlying biological and mechanistic data, which suggest a diet rich in vegetable and fruit matter, including extra virgin olive oil rich in bioactive compounds including polyphenols, is cardioprotective.",41af3eec-175f-478a-9116-931d37bb63fd
27,methods27," Both in vitro and in vivo laboratory studies have demonstrated potential mechanisms by which these compounds can moderate the inflammatory effects of fatty liver [44,45]. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials highlighted the importance of polyphenol-rich food products and cardiovascular outcomes [45]. Adherence to Mediterranean diet has also been associated with other cardiovascular risk factors such as lower central obesity, MetS and low-grade inflammation, consistent with the results demonstrated in this analysis [46]. Mediterranean diet has been associated with a more favourable biochemical profile in metabolic diseases and has also been suggested as protective against type 2 diabetes which has an established link with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [47,48].",55efb291-afa9-4e17-b36f-07fb5d4de393
28,methods28," Although this analysis using structural equation modelling could not demonstrate this pathway via C reactive protein (CRP), it could be that C reactive protein (CRP) lacks sensitivity as a marker of inflammation associated with insulin resistance and fatty liver. Furthermore, C reactive protein (CRP) is susceptible to change with acute illness. However, it should be noted that the Mediterranean diet, especially in Mediterranean populations, may be a surrogate marker for an overall Mediterranean lifestyle including physical activity, social connectedness and less mental health stressors [49]. Thus, the present findings need to be examined in non-Mediterranean populations for further understanding of these associations.  Strengths and Limitations  The presented study has numerous strengths and several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results.",804170a1-4ea5-4ae4-84fd-16cff8dd1163

All exposures were measured at baseline and thus could have changed within the study follow-up, and these changes could not be accounted for in the analysis. However, this is common methodology in observational epidemiological studies and the findings are comparable with the majority of them, although well-established in epidemiological studies [50].",8b952b83-3caa-4116-be60-1e2aad71a7e2

Nevertheless, fatty liver index (FLI) uses routinely assessed clinical measurements of Body mass index (BMI), triglycerides, GGT and waist circumference and therefore has application and translation to clinical practice. The utility of fatty liver index (FLI) needs to be further explored with respect to lifestyle interventions and how they moderate risk of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). When assessing metabolic risk using waist circumference, most definitions and ranges differentiate between genders and ethnicity; however, the ATTICA study is representative of the Greek population which is not ethnically diverse.",d5d228c7-92bb-4052-ac61-66c159c0e001

The rates of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) within this study which reflect markedly higher rates in males are not consistent with global data for Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD); however, based on anthropometric data within Greece, higher rates of waist circumference are expected in males [51] and this is a parameter within the fatty liver index (FLI). Despite the above findings, the diabetes prevalence was overall low in the study, but was consistent with the country’s official diabetes statistics [52]. Therefore, these results may be generalizable to Greece but not to other populations.  5.",0bd1ff34-8ede-49ec-aeac-b03330617745
32,methods32," Conclusions  Fatty liver index as a proxy measure of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a strong predictor of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk, but this prognostic relationship seems to be moderated by the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet within a structural equation model. Further research is needed to examine the underlying mechanisms, with an emphasis on inflammation using additional inflammatory markers. This will assist in further understanding the role of the Mediterranean diet in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) prevention and management. ",418ad15f-163c-48d1-9820-08ba6e74b4da
