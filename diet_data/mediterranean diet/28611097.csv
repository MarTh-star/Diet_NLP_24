The gels were stained with Ruthenium II tris (bathophenanthroline disulfonate) tetrasodium salt (SunaTech Inc., Suzhou, China) (RuBP). ImageQuant LAS4010 (GE Health Care) was used for the acquisition of images. The analysis of images was performed using Same Spot (v4.1, TotalLab, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK) software.

Spot Digestion and Protein Identification The gel pieces were washed twice with the wash buffer (25 mM NH4HCO3 in 50% acetonitrile (ACN)). Afterwards, proteins were reduced with 10 mM ditiothreitol (ditiothreitol (DTT)) (45 min, 56 °C), and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide (iodoacetamide (IAA)) (30 min, RT, in the dark). After two washes with the wash buffer, spots were completely dried in a centrivap vacuum centrifuge. The dried pieces of gel were rehydrated for 30 min at 4 °C in 30 μL of trypsin porcine (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) solution (3 ng/μL in 100 mM NH4HCO3) and then incubated at 37 °C overnight.",1d94e6a3-15b2-4da1-b75c-04687c8d021c

Samples were analyzed by LC-MS as described [70] using a shorter chromatographic gradient and in autoMS mode. Each digested spot sample was analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Proxeon EASY-nLCII (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy) chromatographic system coupled to a Maxis HD UHR-TOF (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometer. Peptides were loaded on the EASY-Column TM C18 trapping column (2 cm L., 100 µm I.D, 5 µm ps, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and subsequently separated on an Acclaim PepMap100 C18 (75 µm I.D., 25 cm L, 5 µm ps, Thermo Fisher Scientific) nanoscale chromatographic column. The flow rate was set to 300 nL/min and the gradient was from 2% to 20% of B in 12 min followed by 20 to 45% in 9 min and from 45% to 90% in 2 min (total run time 35 min). Mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in H2O and mobile phase B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile.",e144b59f-566d-4db5-85e6-ddfc2119b446
10,methods10," The mass spectrometer, typically providing a 60,000 full width at half maximum (full width at half maximum (FMHW)) resolution throughout the mass range, was equipped with a nanoESI spray source. The mass spectrometer was operated in Data Dependent Acquisition mode (Data Dependent Acquisition mode (DDA)), using N2 as the collision gas for collision-induced dissociation (collision induced dissociation (CID)) fragmentation. Precursors in the range 400 to 2200 m/z (excluding 1220.0–1224.5 m/z) with a preferred charge state +2 to +5 and absolute intensity above 4706 counts were selected for fragmentation in a fixed cycle time of 3 s. After two spectra, the precursors were actively excluded from selection for 36 s. Isolation width and collision energy for MS/MS fragmentation were set according to the mass and charge state of the precursor ions (from 2+ to 5+ and from 21 to 55 eV). In-source reference lock mass (1221.9906 m/z) was acquired online throughout runs.",62297054-5abb-49c7-b8b4-a33d915cab12
11,methods11,"  The raw data were processed using PEAKS Studio v7.5 software (Bioinformatic Solutions Inc., Waterloo, ON, Canada) using the function “correct precursor only”. The mass lists were searched against the nextprot database including isoforms (version as of June 2017; 42,151 entries) using 10 ppm and 0.05 Da as the highest error tolerances for parent and fragment ions, respectively. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was selected as fixed modification and oxidation of methionines and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine as variable modifications allowing 2 missed cleavages.  4.13. Network Analysis Proteins differentially expressed obtained from the oleocanthal + H2O2 vs. H2O2 comparison were functionally analyzed through the use of QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA), QIAGEN Redwood City, CA, USA, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) with the aim to determine the predominant canonical pathways and interaction network involved.",3a51c088-54d4-4479-8727-0c78d3b12a3d
12,methods12," Swiss-Prot accession numbers and official gene symbols were inserted into the software along with corresponding comparison ratios and p values. The network proteins associated with biological functions and/or diseases in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base were considered for the analysis. The created networks describe functional relationships among proteins based on known associations in the literature. A comparison of the different analyses was created and the upstream regulators whose activity appears to change in a significant manner according to the activation z-score value were shown. Finally, to generate plausible causal networks which explain observed expression changes, hidden connections in upstream regulators were also uncovered.
