0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design  A multicenter prospective observational study that evaluates the predisposition of first-year university students to suffer from EDs through different validated tests as well as a record of different anthropometric measures, a record of intake, assessment of emotional intake and the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean Diet. This protocol of investigation follows the STROBE guides for transversal studies (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology).  This project will be carried out jointly by the Universitat de Vic-Universitat Central de Catalunya (Barcelona, Spain) with the Universidad Europea del Atlántico (Santander, Spain) and will monitor first-year students residing in university residences, student flats and family residences in the cities of Vic and Santander.  The project will be carried out in three phases that can be observed in Table 1.",c49ddd70-4a80-41aa-90f3-845612776360
1,methods1,"  The recruitment interview that includes the explanation of the project, the suitability of the participant based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, anthropometric measurements and bioimpedance will be carried out in the simulation laboratories of Universitat de Vic-Universitat Central de Catalunya and in the University Clinic of the Universidad Europea del Atlántico.  2.2. Participant Recruitment  Study participants will be recruited in the different university residences with prior authorization by the residences, and on the various university campuses with the corresponding authorization.  An email will be sent through the virtual campuses of the two universities to all students enrolled in the first year, inviting them to participate in this study.",c3b008df-8b2a-4e8a-9b14-585de9ccaa42
2,methods2," In this email, the volunteers will be offered contact with the main investigator of the study, may request more information and may arrange an initial interview to assess whether this volunteer can be included in the study, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria set out in Table 2.  Participants who are not excluded will be given the informed consent document; it will be explained again how the study will work and what is expected of them. When they sign the document, they will be included in the project, and their participation will begin.  Each participant will be identified with a random and individual code that they will need to use to identify the different documents that have to be filled out.  2.3. Data Collection and Measures  The valid and reliable measurement methods used to answer the study’s research question are listed in Table 1 and explained below:  1. Online survey, the link, and an individual code will be provided via email.",a88ba27e-e553-4a81-8e54-ba122b32d0da
3,methods3," Through this first contact with the student, a set of sociodemographic data (gender, date of birth, origin, email address, place of residence and current academic studies) and a series of parameters related to their lifestyle will be collected: physical activity, eating habits and habits related to their food intake. The following survey presents the various screening tests that the student must complete:  The EAT-26 is a globally used self-administered questionnaire, the summary version of which has properties of confidence and validity for EDs screening [26]. It was designed with the purpose of developing and validating a rating scale that would be useful in assessing a wide range of behaviors and attitudes present in AN. It initially had 40 items (EAT-40), but studies regarding its psychometric qualities led to an abbreviation of the same, resulting in a 26-item questionnaire, which was validated in a Spanish population in 2010 [21].",b1fb9a3f-1155-49b8-b33c-0d0d0f928813
4,methods4," The instrument consists of three subscales: (a) diet: includes 13 items on avoidant behaviors in regard to fattening foods and concerns about thinness; (b) bulimia and food concern: includes six items on bulimic behaviors and thoughts related to food, and (c) oral control: includes the last seven items on self-control of intake and external pressure for weight gain. Each question has six answer options with different scores: 0 points (never, rarely, sometimes); 1 point (often); 2 points (very often); and 3 points (always). The total score is the sum of the answers to the 26 items, considering that question 25 scores in reverse. The higher the score, the higher the risk of AN or BN. The optimal cut-off points for EAT-26 as a EDs screening questionnaire is 20 (sensitivity = 100%; specificity = 97.",b799243a-fa14-40e2-a1f5-327764ed99d2
5,methods5,"8%); therefore, if the final score is ≤20 points, there is no presence of EDs, and if the final score is >20 points, more research with a professional is required because an EDs could be presented.  The Teen Figure Drawing Scale [22] is a questionnaire that analyzes satisfaction with body image through two variables: perceived silhouette and desired silhouette. This test consists of seven human figures (silhouettes), which gradually increase in size, from an “extremely thin” figure on the left side to an “extremely robust” figure on the right side. Each figure is assigned a certain body mass index (BMI), classified into (1) underweight, (2) low moderate weight, (3) low light weight, (4) normal weight, (5) overweight, (6) moderate overweight and (7) obesity. Participants choose a figure to describe themselves (real self) and another that they would like to resemble (ideal self), and then body dissatisfaction is conceptualized as a discrepancy between the two responses, i.e.",b96fd118-1499-4f9f-b699-8ab16803422c
6,methods6,", a gap between the ideal self and the real self. Positive and negative signs indicate dissatisfaction with the body: the desire to get bigger or thinner.  The Scale [22] Eating Behavior Test (SCOFF) survey is a short and simple instrument that has demonstrated adequate sensitivity and specificity for EDs screening [23]. This is a five-item scale that quantifies some of the central symptoms related to eating disorders over the past three months. It presents a dichotomous response pattern (yes/no). The affirmative answers receive a point so that total scores between 0 and 5 can be obtained. The questionnaire is positive, and there is a risk of presenting/displaying an EDs when the person answers affirmatively to two or more questions.  The Bulimia Investigatory Test Edinburgh (BITE) test [24] assesses the presence and severity of bulimic symptoms and the cognitive and emotional signs and symptoms associated with binges.",2f9aec19-fbc0-4940-833a-47c67c6bb5a6
7,methods7, It consists of 33 items divided into two different subscales: a symptom subscale with 30 items with a dichotomous response pattern (yes/no) and a severity subscale with five or seven response options depending on the item. The total score is the sum of the answers of the 33 items and is interpreted as follows: if the final score is <10 points (there is no problem in eating behavior); if the final score is between 10–20 points (presence of abnormal eating patterns); if the final score is >20 points (presence of abnormal feeding patterns with the possibility of presenting BN).  The MEDAS-14 [15] is a validated dietary assessment tool used in the PREDIMED study. It consists of 14 items and allows you to assess the degree of adherence to the pattern of the Mediterranean Diet (MD). Each question has two answer options with different scores.,361d07c5-6857-414a-847b-1626e61257fd
8,methods8, The total score is the sum of the answers of the 14 items and is interpreted as follows: if the final score is >8 points (good adherence to the MD); if the final score is between 5 and 8 points (adherence can be improved to the MD); and if the final score is <5 points (low adherence to MD).  The Emotional Eater Questionnaire (EEQ) [25] was created with the aim of evaluating the effect of emotions on eating behavior. It consists of 10 items. Each question has four answer options with different scores: 0 points (never); 1 point (sometimes); 2 points (usually); and 3 points (always). The total score is the sum of the answers of the 10 items.,739e094d-55ce-4435-aa99-205e8a0c212b
9,methods9," For clinical practice, subjects are classified as follows: if the final score is between 0–5 points: Non-Emotional eater (person with great stability in terms of eating behavior, eats when feeling physiological hunger without taking into account external factors or emotions); if the final score is between 6–10 points: Low emotional Eater (non-emotional person with respect to their diet, except that certain foods influence their will and that food is more than just eating); if the final score is between 11–20 points: Emotional Eater (person who eats conditioned by their emotions, however, the food does not control their actions, so they maintain a certain mastery of the their food); if the final score is between 21–30 points: Very Emotional eater (person especially vulnerable to suffering from some kind of eating disorder (anorexia, bulimia) if no corrective measures are applied).  2. 72 hDR.",373a5345-2e3f-487c-bc8e-e4b45982e9dc
10,methods10," Document to fill out—the 72 hDR is delivered after the first interview and after the appointment to take the anthropometric measurements of the 1st phase of the project. The first record must be returned to the team within the following 15 days, and the second must be delivered 15 days after taking anthropometric measurements of the 3rd phase. The participant must write down for three days (two weekdays and one weekend day) all the meals they prepare, the food they eat (inside and outside the main meals), the culinary techniques used and the quantities (in weights or homemade measures). The participant must return the document via email after fifteen days, in Word or PDF format.",d4d1e40e-694d-4802-af66-3f7dbb0c12d6

Anthropometric measurements. Specific anthropometric measurements will be taken for each participant in each of the different phases: body weight (kg), body height (cm) and abdominal perimeter (cm) tricipital fold (mm) and bioimpedance (TANITA TBF300).  With regards to data collection and the consequent analysis of quantitative variables, the different answers obtained in the different phases of the project (initial, intermediate and final) will be compared for the same question.  2.4.",f373d215-fbd8-4fea-b295-306477ef8b65
12,methods12," Statistical Analysis  The sample size is calculated for finite populations by counting the students who enter the first year at both universities. It is calculated with a 95% confidence level, 5% of error range, a precision level (d = 3%) and an expected proportion of losses of 15%.

In the case of the Universidad Europea del Atlántico, the universe of (n = 400 students), and the representative sample size of (n = 168 students).  The analysis of the data will be performed as follows:Normality distribution for quantitative variables will be assessed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality test. The quantitative variables will be expressed as the mean and standard deviation, and the body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) will be distributed using WHO range classification.",81ea918d-3038-4519-9a49-5ca44fe453f4
13,methods13,"  For the dichotomic quantitative variables, Student’s t-test or the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test will be used and for the polycotomic ANOVA test, or the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test. Univariate comparisons will be investigated between groups extracted from the same tests, but from two groups (students living with parents and those living independently in residences or apartment flat). The fact of comparing means implies the fact of carrying out the Levene Test, which is undertaken to observe the equality or inequality of the variances in the two groups.  For the qualitative variables, we will make a contingency table to observe from each possible answer how many people have selected it. We will use the percentages in these variables and for the comparison of the data using the Pearson X2 test or nonparametric Fisher’s exact test for categorical data.  The criterion of significance is established at p < 0.05.",e967819e-e5c5-4dfb-b755-62cbf0a64d7f

Discussion  The aim of this investigation is to identify the risk of alimentary behavior disorders in college students in the first year and to determine the alimentary habits and body composition of these individuals at two universities in Spain, and how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the eating behavior of students.",b3ce87a8-e68c-445d-8c0b-1efb772c3ff1
16,methods16,"  College students are a vulnerable group in relation to their nutritional health, owing to changes in lifestyle and the production in young students of food insecurity and changes in body weight and composition [10,20,27].  On one hand, students increase the number of hours they are sitting at the university and in their own homes, and this increases their sedentary lifestyle. On the other hand, it presents a greater independence with regard to the hour they eat and the foods that they choose to consume, their eating schedule and the number of foods they eat throughout the day, even though some student’s become independent from the family home [28].  A healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean Diet, is one of the main warning factors of obesity or non-transmissible illnesses, such as diabetes mellitus type II [29]. A healthy diet would have to include a high consumption of fruit, vegetable and integral cereals and a low consumption of saturated fat, salt, and simple carbohydrates [30].",851126be-50a2-44df-afc0-33fb264265b0
17,methods17,"  The college stage is a period of transition between adolescence and adulthood and, thereby, is a good moment to promote strategies of healthy eating [31].  The increase in the consumption of hypercaloric and unstable diets in this university stage shows poor adherence to the Mediterranean Diet of students [17].  The lack of time caused by an increase in the hours of study is one of the main barriers to healthy eating by university students, as well as the lack of sufficiently healthy foods in university canteens [31].  In addition, stress is another factor that influences changes in healthy habits, with students experiencing a greater degree of stress tending to consume less healthy junk foods [32].  Various studies have observed that the consumption of fruits and vegetables has declined significantly in the Dutch population [33] as in the Spanish population.",59042eaf-32e3-4f80-b49f-1eb2e82f41e1
18,methods18," In addition, university students in the Mediterranean area move away from the MD pattern, towards a diet high in saturated fat and simple sugars [34]. Moreno-Gómez et al. also observed, in 2012, that another problem was linked to the increase in alcohol consumption (up to 80% of respondents) and tobacco use (up to 35.9% of respondents) [34].  Negative emotions that have been studied and related to eating behavior include sadness, anger, frustration, anxiety, fear, and boredom. First-year college students experiencing negative emotions may be less motivated to make healthy food choices and more likely to make poor food choices [35].  Another notable change in the lives of the students will be the coexistence with other students who arrive at the university in this period 2020/21; In these cases, living without a family environment in a university environment may cause alterations in eating habits and facilitate the appearance of eating disorders.",0aee3f1f-a4b3-42da-826c-6d1ee282118a
19,methods19," It's more, a post-pandemic experience of confinement, social distancing and the perception of the risk for their health due to COVID-19, can favor this type of pathology [19,20,36].  All these circumstances determine the need to study alimentary habits and the risk of suffering EDs in this community, and to be able to predict the usual prevalence of EDs, as well as the perception of the corporal image, real consumption, and alterations in different anthropometric parameters, to establish strategies of suitable alimentary education for the needs of young students in universities.  However, little up-to-date literature exists in Spain; neither is available research linked to the situation of the pandemic, which represents an opportunity for further research to be included in the analysis; additionally, the possible behaviors linked to consumption, or the follow-up of the MD, could provide answers to the needs of university students in this vital time of change and tied to the pandemic.",b0461f47-9e00-4e54-8a84-527765d7cbfc
20,methods20,"  Although this study is a good opportunity for investigation, it is necessary to present the potential biases associated with the methodological design of this protocol. The possible biases include: capacity of recruitment of volunteers, of time in the reply of the surveys, of veracity in the self-reporting. To increase participation, the dissemination channels of the two universities will be used to recruit the necessary students for the study and presentations of the study will be made in the groups of first-year students to facilitate knowledge of the project and desire to participate. To guarantee the veracity of the data, information will be added on how to fill in the different tests and how to fill in the 72-h record. Moreover, the principal limitation would be the maintenance of the sample over time. We would expect that participation in both centers would reduce the risks and affect the results.",fd386e87-cc43-43eb-8411-77c78484acd3
