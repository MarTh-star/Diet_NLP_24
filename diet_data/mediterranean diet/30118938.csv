0,methods0,"2.1. Population In this study, data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) were used, due to the long follow-up of the participants. The NHANES III was a nationwide survey, conducted between 1988 and 1994 in the United States. Participants were interviewed and underwent physical examination in a mobile examination center. Detailed description of the methodology of the NHANES III is described elsewhere [20]. NHANES III data are publically available and can be accessed online [21]. Therefore institutional review board approval and oversight were not required for our study.  In this study, only female participants who had self-reported a previous breast, ovarian, cervical or uterine cancer diagnosis were included in the analyses.",e7e12592-5d40-415a-b41b-739f6ec13f46
1,methods1," Participants were defined as cancer survivors if they answered “yes” to the question, “Has a doctor ever told you that you had other cancer?” In following questions participants had to specify the site of their cancer diagnosis and their age at cancer diagnosis (“How old were you when you were first told you had other cancer?”). Participants who also self-reported a skin cancer diagnosis (n = 26; answered “yes” to the question, “Has a doctor ever told you that you had skin cancer?”), with missing information on either of the exposure variables (n = 4) or any of the confounding variables (n = 50) were excluded from the analyses (Figure 1). The final study population included 230 participants. Of these, 110 were breast cancer survivors (BCa) and 120 were gynecological cancer (i.e., ovarian (n = 19), cervical (n = 54), and uterine cancer (n = 47); GynCa) survivors.  2.2. Outcome Ascertainment The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality.",fffd48d1-8efe-4d4c-a04c-15fcd5dc1fae
2,methods2," Probabilistic linkage of the NHANES III with the National Death Index, maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics, was used to obtain mortality information. Detailed description of the linkage was previously described [22]. Previous studies have reported accurate ascertainment of participants’ death by the National Death Index [23,24,25]. Follow-up time was defined as the time from completion of the NHANES III questionnaire (in months) until death from any cause or end of follow-up (December 31, 2011), whichever came first.  2.3. Assessment Dietary information was obtained via a 24-hour dietary recall interview. Data collection was scheduled as such as to include interviews all days of the week and throughout the year. During an interview by trained interviewers, participants were requested to report their food and beverage consumption of the past 24 hours. Additional information including (but not limited to) the quantities, recipes, and place of eating was also recorded.",135d496d-cfc1-4f5e-87d8-3291da179509
3,methods3," The nutrient values were calculated using recipe ingredient nutrient values found in the US Department of Agriculture’s (US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA)) Survey Nutrient Database Nutrient Files. The dietary information of the 24-hour dietary recall interview was used to calculate the diet quality indices.  To assess moderate to vigorous physical activity NHANES III participants were asked how frequently (but not for how long) they performed leisure time exercise or physical activities in the past month. Their answers were then transformed to “times per week” using the conversion factor 4.3 weeks per month.  2.4. Healthy Eating Index The Healthy Eating Index (HEI), developed by the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA), includes 10 equally weighted distinct components and the sum of each participant’s score in the components constitutes their individual score.",45135f99-b75b-4dae-a1ef-6485b7c21fa8
4,methods4," Components 1–5 estimate a participant’s conformity to the recommendations by the Food Guide Pyramid for the grain, vegetable, fruit, milk, and meat groups. Components 6–9 capture total fat, saturated fat, total cholesterol, and sodium dietary intake. Finally, component 10 estimates the variety in a participant’s diet. The score can range from 0 to 100 and the higher a participant’s score on the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), the better the diet according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Food Guide Pyramid [20]. Participants were dichotomized based on their Healthy Eating Index (HEI) (poor (Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score < 70); good (Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score ≥ 70)).  2.5.",f6125320-4e7d-43c1-8141-5c7155308f0a
5,methods5," Mediterranean Diet Score The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) [13] assesses the adherence to the Mediterranean diet by including the consumption of 9 components (legumes, vegetables, fruit and nuts, cereals, fish and seafood, meat and meat products, dairy products, the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fats and alcohol). The components of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were composed by linking the 24-hour dietary recall data with My Pyramid Equivalents Database for US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) survey food codes. The daily consumption of each of the components (in servings/100 g/day) was calculated for every participant. The median consumption for each component was estimated in our study population and then participants were scored with 0 or 1 for each component based on the relation of their consumption to the study median.",eec558dd-f056-4380-9634-4e22bfb0c353
6,methods6," Participants with consumption of legumes, vegetables, fruit and nuts, cereals, and fish and seafood above the median received 1 point (per component), whereas consumption of meat and meat products, dairy products and a ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fats lower than the median received 1 point (per component). Finally, participants with alcohol consumption of 5–25 g per day (approximately 0.3 to 2 drinks) received 1 point. The sum of all the points was calculated as each individual’s Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) can range from 0 to 9. Participants were divided into two groups based on their score; participants with Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) 0–4 were considered to be “non-adherers”, whereas participants with Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) 5–9 were considered to be “adherers”.  2.6.",cc216e51-3b3a-4981-b1d8-67343d906fb6

The association between each diet quality index and mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Model 2 was further adjusted for alcohol intake (frequency of beer, wine, and hard liquor intake; times per month) in the analyses for the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) but not for the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), since alcohol intake is already included within this index. The results were presented as hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).",42e80e94-6f03-403f-8186-6c59be8d01d3
10,methods10,"  Baseline characteristics were compared between female breast or gynecological cancers survivors and female participants of the NHANES III without a self-reported cancer diagnosis. Sensitivity analysis was performed excluding alcohol consumption from the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS).  Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) software and significance levels were set at a = 0.05. Sampling weights, adapted according to our total study population and sub-groups, were used in all analyses to account for the complex survey design and survey non-response.  3. Results Overall mean time between cancer diagnosis and completion of the NHANES III questionnaire was 10.4 years (standard errors of the mean (SEM) 0.7; breast cancer survivors: 8.6 years, standard errors of the mean (SEM): 0.7; gynecological cancer survivors: 12.0 years, standard errors of the mean (SEM): 1.0).",92affaa9-cdea-4441-a0db-4f008ed8edd3
11,methods11," Breast cancer survivors completed the NHANES III questionnaire at an older age and were less likely to be current smokers compared to gynecological cancer survivors (Table 1). Breast cancer survivors were more likely to report higher income and had slightly higher BMI compared to gynecological cancer survivors. Female breast or gynecological cancer survivors included in this project were less physically active and more likely to be current smokers compared to female NHANES III participants who did not report history of cancer (Table 2). Regarding their dietary habits, female breast or gynecological cancer survivors had slightly higher Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score and increased fruit and vegetable consumption compared to female participants who did not report history of cancer.  The association between the diet quality indices and mortality, after an overall mean follow-up time of approximately 16 years, is shown in Table 3.",f42a0bf6-1c04-4cb7-aa75-4d4757cf2b3c
12,methods12," The number of deaths recorded until the end of follow-up was 121. In continuous models, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was statistically significantly associated with lower mortality (HRHealthy Eating Index (HEI) total = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95–0.98, HRHealthy Eating Index (HEI) BCa = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95–0.99, HRHealthy Eating Index (HEI) GynCa = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89–0.96, in the fully adjusted models, per 1 unit increase in the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score). In categorical models, high diet quality (corresponding to Healthy Eating Index (HEI) ≥ 70) was statistically significantly associated with mortality risk in the total study population (HRHealthy Eating Index (HEI) good vs. poor total = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.29–0.64). Sub-group analyses revealed similar results for gynecological cancer survivors (HRHealthy Eating Index (HEI) good vs. poor GyCa = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.10–0.43) and breast cancer survivors (HRHealthy Eating Index (HEI) good vs. poor BCa = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.25–0.97).",5f8c70c9-faa1-49f3-948c-fa47887d043a

14,methods14," Discussion In our study of female cancer survivors, post-diagnostic diet quality, as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), was associated with reduced mortality. In subgroup analyses, the statistically significant inverse association was evident in both breast and gynecological cancer survivors. For the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), a non-statistically significant inverse association was observed overall and in the subgroups.  Even though statistically significant associations were observed between the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and mortality, the association between the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and mortality was not statistically significant. A possible explanation for the lack of statistically significant associations is that very few participants in our study had high Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was based on the diet observed in European populations living around the Mediterranean region.",f45f461f-b96a-481a-9b39-8ea1b628b11a
15,methods15," On the other hand, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was specifically designed to capture the diet quality of the US population (e.g., the first five components reflect conformity to the Food Pyramid Guide for the US population). This could suggest that the dietary pattern adopted by the US population differs from the Mediterranean diet and that the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) may not be able to accurately capture the diet of this population. Given the multiple health benefits associated with the Mediterranean diet, several interventions were proposed in order to facilitate the adoption of the Mediterranean diet by the US population [27].  An inverse association between higher-quality diets (captured either by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) or the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) and mortality risk in disease-free populations was suggested previously [6,8,11,28,29].",105db5cb-666e-4b07-a8a1-439cce28ff87
16,methods16," Additionally, several studies have reported better prognosis in cancer survivors [30] and/or specifically female cancer survivors who adhered to a higher quality diet after diagnosis [4,10,31,32]. However, there are also studies suggesting that post-diagnostic diet and/or post-diagnostic diet quality are not associated with survival [5,19,33]. Our findings on the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) are in line with the former studies and provide additional evidence in favor of a higher quality post-diagnostic diet as a modifiable risk factor.  A mechanism potentially explaining our findings could be mediated through inflammation. Breast cancer survivors who adopted higher quality diets post-diagnosis exhibited lower C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) levels, compared to those with lower quality diets [34]. A positive association between C reactive protein (CRP) levels and mortality in disease-free individuals [35], as well as in cancer patients [36] is reported in the literature.",5e5202f3-5230-4bf9-837f-78b3c5fbd863
17,methods17," Furthermore, improved survival after invasive breast cancer diagnosis was reported in women consuming diets with low inflammatory potential [37]. Diet with high inflammatory potential was previously associated with higher all-cause mortality risk in participants of the NHANES III [38]. Given that the diet corresponding to higher Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score is considered a diet with low inflammatory potential, the inverse association we observed could be mediated through lower C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Another possible mechanism explaining our findings could be through meeting the micronutrient and mineral dietary requirements. Lower quality diets may be insufficient/deficient in various protective micronutrients and minerals and/or be abundant in potentially harmful agents. Long-term low micronutrient and mineral intake could be associated with worse health outcomes, including mortality [39,40].",7ea50e75-fc9f-4690-b38b-e1642ebea22b
18,methods18,"  The lifestyle differences and the lack of diet quality differences between female NHANES III participants without a self-reported cancer diagnosis and the female breast or gynecological cancer survivors included in this study (Table 2) could indicate that other lifestyle modifications, e.g., increasing physical activity or quitting smoking, may be easier to implement and to sustain over time compared to dietary modifications. Thus, further guidance and support may be necessary for female cancer survivors to adhere to a healthier, higher-quality diet post-diagnosis.  Our study had several strengths. The prospective study design and the long follow-up time allowed us to establish a clear period between disease onset, post-diagnostic dietary habits, and mortality. Additionally, the detailed information collection at baseline allowed us to adjust for various lifestyle factors that may influence mortality.  However, this study also has several limitations.",3fc04966-860d-4dad-bbf5-6a5779cec776
19,methods19," The small sample size of female breast or gynecological cancer survivors may not have allowed the detection of a significant association between the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), and mortality. Additionally, our results were based on only one assessment of the dietary habits and may not reflect the true or long-term habits of individual participants. However, both diet quality indices were validated in previous studies and seem to adequately capture peoples’ dietary habits. As in any observational study, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding. We cannot exclude the possibility that the female cancer survivors that participated in the NHANES III and in our study could have been healthier than female cancer survivors that did not participate in the NHANES III. Due to the small number of gynecological cancer survivors we were not able to perform analyses separately for every cancer type. It is plausible that some cancer cases (e.g.",3cdfb1ae-dc73-40db-bd7d-1ee92cfc4e65
20,methods20,", ovarian) were detected early since otherwise, patients’ survival is very low. Finally, since information regarding disease severity or treatment was not available, we were not able to account for them in our analyses. Yet, given the long time between cancer diagnosis and mortality, cancer treatment and severity are unlikely to severely affect our results. Future projects should aim to capture this information and include them in the analyses as covariates.  In conclusion, higher post-diagnostic diet quality, as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), was inversely associated with mortality in female cancer survivors, suggesting a protective effect when adhering to the diet captured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI). Additional studies are required in order to verify our findings and to investigate underlying mechanisms of the mortality-adherence association.",99ec8de1-8d5e-462c-a623-2e83b19d6181
