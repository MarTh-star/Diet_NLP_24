0,methods0," Study Design and Subjects  The current study was conducted based on the Coronary Diet Intervention With Olive Oil and Cardiovascular Prevention (Cardiovascular Prevention (CORDIOPREV)) study, which is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial including 1002 patients with coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) to compare the effects of the consumption of two different dietary patterns (LF diet versus MedDiet) on the incidence of cardiovascular events of patients with coronary disease after 7 years of intervention (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00924937). The design, rationale and baseline characteristics of the Cardiovascular Prevention (CORDIOPREV) study have been described elsewhere (39). Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Supplementary Table 1.",e48a02ae-b538-42b9-8dbf-bf7d1e73cf9b
1,methods1," Briefly, patients were eligible if they were older than 20 but younger than 76 years old, had established coronary heart disease (CHD), were thought to follow a long-term dietary intervention and had no severe diseases or an expected life expectancy lower than the length of the study. No medication was defined as an exclusion criteria. Details of the dietary intervention have been published previously (40). In summary, the dietary models were as follows: (1) MedDiet, with a minimum of 35% of calories as fat (22% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), 6% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and <10% saturated), 15% protein, and a maximum of 50% carbohydrates, and (2) LF diet, with high complex carbohydrates, <30% of total fat (<10% saturated fat, 12–14% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and 6–8% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)), 15% protein, an a minimum of 55% carbohydrates.",62da6564-60d3-4fa1-82fe-35674d4b801c
2,methods2," The 14-point Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) and a 9-point Low-Fat diet adherence were used to assess dietary adherence (41). There were no energy restrictions in place.  From 1002 patients included in the Cardiovascular Prevention (CORDIOPREV) study, a total of 557 patients completed an oral fat test tolerance (oral fat tolerance test (OFTT)) at baseline and after 3 years of intervention and were selected for genotyping.  The Ethics Committee of Reina Sofía University Hospital approved the trial protocol (n°1496/27/03/2009), which follows the Helsinki declaration and the charter of good clinical practices. The experimental protocol conforms to international ethical standards, and written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects.",5b5d2fc7-4d43-4f40-aff2-b6476564bf28
3,methods3,"  Oral Fat Tolerance Tests  At the start of the Cardiovascular Prevention (CORDIOPREV) Study and after 3 years of dietary intervention, patients received an oral fat tolerance test (OFTT) using a weight-adjusted meal (0.7 g fat and 5 mg cholesterol per kg body weight) with 12% saturated fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA)), 10% polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)), 43% monounsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)), 10% protein, and 25% carbohydrates (carbohydrates (CHO)). The methodology followed for the oral fat tolerance test (OFTT) has been described in the previous work of our group (42).  The patients fasted before beginning the test (no food or medicines) for 12 h. They were advised to refrain from smoking throughout the fasting period and from consuming alcohol for the previous 7 days. They were also instructed not to engage in any strenuous physical activity the day before the exam.  At 08:00 a.m.",937667d8-77aa-4dcd-ae88-82865022cb5d
4,methods4,", the patients arrived at the clinical center and a fasting blood sample and anthropometric measures were taken. Then, they consumed a fat-rich meal challenge under observation during a maximum period of 20 min. The participants were allowed to drink water but were not allowed to eat other foods or drink other beverages during the test period. Blood samples for postprandial biochemical measurements were taken every hour for the following 4 h.  Laboratory Tests and Genotyping  Biochemical measurements and DNA isolation have been previously described (43). 200 uL of DNA (50 ng/uL) isolated from blood samples were sent to the Human Genomics Facility of the Genetic Laboratory of the Department of Internal Medicine at Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, Netherlands), where genotyping was performed using the Illumina GSA beadchip GSA MD v1 (Illumina GSA Arrays “Infinium iSelect 24 × 1 HTS Custom Beadchip Kit”).",d584396a-404c-4b86-94ed-a4893930e715
5,methods5," In this research, we analyzed the rs964184 variation previously reported in the literature linked with lipid metabolism and coronary artery disease (24, 34).  Statistical Analysis  All variables had their distributions checked for normality, and skewed variables were normalized using log10 as needed. Depending on the presence of two or more groups in each comparison, continuous variables were compared using Student’s “t” and analysis of variance (and analysis of variance (ANCOVA)). To quantify the magnitude of change during the postprandial state, we evaluated total (AUC) and incremental (iAUC) area under the curves of the different postprandial parameters using the trapezoid method, as in earlier works by our group (42). The genotype distributions did not differ from those predicted by Hardy-Weinberg (P > 0.05). Due to the low frequencies of homozygous patients for the minor allele (G/G = 7), patients carrying some risk allele (G/G or C/G) were grouped for analysis.",a42db867-259a-4589-b473-cdbae64d8893
6,methods6," Differences in postprandial values were identified using repeated-measures ANOVA, adjusting by age, gender, lipid-lowering drugs, and body mass index (body mass index (BMI)). We calculated the overall gene influence (single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) p-value), the kinetics of the response (Time p-value) and the interaction of both factors (Time × single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) p-value). An single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-diet interaction term was used to evaluate gene-diet interactions. Bonferroni’s correction was used for multiple comparisons when necessary. Differences were considered to be significant when p < 0.05. All analyses were performed using R software (version 3.6.1). ",9ec0d70b-667e-4eda-ab75-985357ba8211

14,discussion0," In this study, we investigated the effects of a long-term dietary intervention in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients on postprandial triglyceridemia according to the presence or absence of the G allele at the ZPR1 rs964184 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Our results show that the potential TG-rising effect of the G allele can be differentially modulated by diet. Specifically, carriers of the rs964184 allele risk (G/G or C/G), who, on average, had higher TG levels at baseline than CC carriers, decreased their TGs to levels similar to the CC carriers when following an LF diet for 3 years. Conversely, those G-allele carriers who followed a MedDiet intervention maintained their significantly higher TGs during the duration of the follow-up.  Dietetic interventions that encourage high-quality dietary patterns with moderate caloric intake have been linked to improved cardiovascular risk factor control (44).",0727cb19-0aed-410e-b641-d5afea643855
15,discussion1," In that way, the MedDiet has been proposed as a compelling option for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (41), as well as an alternative to other dietary patterns, such as LF diets (22, 39). Thus, in a subgroup of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus from the Cardiovascular Prevention (CORDIOPREV) trial, we previously assessed the favorable effects of the MedDiet compared to the LF diet on PPL, finding that long-term consumption of the MedDiet improves PPL response compared to consumption of a low-fat diet (37). Furthermore, we reported a gene-diet interaction between a variation in the APOE gene (rs439401) and MedDiet, with T-allele carriers in the MedDiet group showing a more significant decrease in postprandial TG compared with CC subject (38).",8559f270-ee49-4a1c-a0a0-b56c06db2b7c
16,discussion2,"  Given that increased TG levels, both fasting and non-fasting, have been related to higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (45, 46), the results of the current study provide evidence that specific nutritional advice can benefit patients who are genetically predisposed to higher fasting and postprandial TGs and supports the notion of Precision Nutrition as the path to promote better health (47).  Previous studies have reported that polymorphisms in or near the ZPR1-APOA5-A4-C3-A1 gene complex are associated with plasma lipids and cardiovascular risk (33, 35, 48, 49). The results of the current study support previous findings, showing that rs964184 within the ZPR1 locus is associated with fasting plasma TG levels and HDL-c. This relation with fasting TG has been well documented (26, 50), and has been replicated recently in a longitudinal multi-ancestry cohort (European, African, and Asian ancestry) (49).",ab0e2ba8-a624-4297-9fb1-9b590bdb4763
17,discussion3," In accordance with our results, in a cohort of 734 overweight or obese participants from the Pounds Lost Trial, the carriers of the G allele exhibited higher fasting TG and lower HDL-c values at baseline. Moreover, in that population, and after a 2-year intervention, a significant interaction between the rs964184 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and dietary fat intake (low vs. high) was reported in TC, LDL-c, and HDL-c variations (36). Specifically, G carriers benefited from a low-fat diet more than CC carriers in relation to TC and LDL-c changes. However, in our study, no gene-diet interactions were identified in fasting lipid changes after the 3-year intervention, and the significant differences observed between genotypes in HDL-c and TG values at baseline remained unchanged at the end of both interventions. Additionally, we have investigated this reported interaction more deeply by examining the effects of long-term healthy dietary interventions on postprandial TG metabolism.",40c3e3d4-a8ce-488b-bc64-f62161e3c1ff
18,discussion4," Dietary fat intake in our study ranged from a minimum of 35% of the total calories as fat (22% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) in the MedDiet group to less than 30% of total calories as fat in the LF diet group (39, 40). Our data demonstrate that, in this patient population, G-allele carriers benefit more from an LF diet than from a MedDiet concerning postprandial TG metabolism. As far as we know, no other studies have evaluated the effect of these diets on rs964184 to modulate the postprandial TG response.  In addition to postprandial metabolism and plasma lipid concentration, different clinical phenomena have been related to the genetic variant studied in the present study. Metabolic syndrome, T2DM, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)), and cardiovascular disease have all been associated with the ZPR1 variation rs964184 among different populations (31, 35, 51).",2e0b6b21-141d-40d5-a55e-632820c21ba2
19,discussion5," Thus, in a prospective cohort of 185 Spanish patients with primary hypertriglyceridemia, a significant recessive model of risk of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was reported, with an Odds Ratio of 4.99 in G/G patients vs. C/G + C/C patients (31). Regarding cardiovascular risk, in a study of 725 Caucasian patients with genetically confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia, Paquette et al. (35) found that rs964184 was significantly associated with incident myocardial infarction even after controlling for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, in a cohort of 3757 Japanese individuals who either visited outpatient clinics or were admitted to 6 selected hospitals between 2002 and 2012, the G allele of rs964184 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes prevalence (OR = 1.25) (29), indicating that this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may represent a risk factor for all these conditions.",cf79d6ba-b8a9-4f2c-a169-7f6f70a71091
20,discussion6," In our study, no genotype differences were observed for the risk of diabetes or obesity, as shown in Table 1, probably related to the particular characteristics of this cohort of secondary prevention patients, with a higher prevalence of cardiometabolic abnormalities compared to the general population.  On the other hand, other environmental factors have also been suggested to modulate this genetic variant. Thus, longer sleep duration has been related to the adverse effects of a genetic risk score constructed in 8648 healthy subjects from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort with a set of 4 polymorphisms in the APOA4-APOA5-ZPR1-BUD13 gene cluster (rs17119975, rs651821, rs7396835, and rs964184) on 5-year triglyceride changes (52). Furthermore, in addition to the influence of genetic background, exercise frequency, hypertension, and education level have been explored as environmental risk factors that may affect serum lipid profiles and diabetes risk. In this way, Li et al.",6756aaa0-99a5-4df6-9ea5-f40a450a39a3
21,discussion7," explored in a cohort of 2323 Chinese Han subjects from the Zhejiang Province which genes and environmental factors were associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus risk (30). They reported a set of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s and environmental factors that were associated with a higher risk of T2DM, which included rs96418, together with a history of hypertension, regular intake of meat, and waist circumference.  The mechanisms responsible for the reported interaction have not been elucidated. rs964184 is located within the 3-UTR of the ZPR1 gene, which codified a key regulatory protein required for appropriate nucleolar activity in cell proliferation and signal transduction (51). ZPR1’s promoter region has the ability to bind to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG)) proteins 1 and 2, which may activate genes involved in glucose and cholesterol metabolism via hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha activation (51).",b6bb514d-5d60-4909-9963-0143b6146493
22,discussion8," On the other hand, a micro-RNA-related mechanism may also be involved as it has been shown for other TG-related gene-diet interactions. MicroRNAs (miRs) are short nucleotide non-coding RNAs that operate as post-transcriptional inhibitors of gene expression by binding to miR recognition sites within their target mRNAs’ 3-UTRs (53). Previous research has shown that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s can cause allele-specific regulation by disrupting crucial areas for binding miRs, known as seed sites, as in the case of the lipoprotein lipase (lipoprotein lipase (LPL)) variant rs13702 via interfering with the miR-410 seed site (54, 55). Future studies are needed to discover the possible underlying mechanisms responsible for the described interaction between the rs964184 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and PPL.  Our study has some limitations.",860273d1-7759-4688-b446-6587499ba1ac
23,discussion9," Given the characteristics of the Cardiovascular Prevention (CORDIOPREV) study population, most patients were exposed to the effect of lipid-lowering drugs prescribed for their existing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although no differences were observed in the baseline use of statins or fibrates, their use has been related to changes in postprandial metabolism (56, 57) that might influence our results. Moreover, a previous study has reported a gender effect related to this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (58); however, given the small number of women in our patient population, we could not test this gene-diet-sex interaction. Thus, the generalization of our results should be made with caution and would require validation on external populations.",96d208e1-633b-4df2-bb9e-9d598b57c6f9
24,discussion10," Nevertheless, our study has strengths such as the characterization of the modulation of genetic induced effects of coronary patients who have received a long-term nutritional intervention, as well as the performance of dynamic postprandial studies beyond the determination of fasting parameters. Future studies should evaluate whether this gene-diet interaction may be associated with a decrease in the rate of incident vascular events.  In summary, the development of specific nutritional advice based on genetic differences between individuals on their response to specific dietary patterns may promote better health in patients with cardiometabolic risk factors.",6c4ca73f-c9a6-4b7c-8b63-0ea8e01a4f69
25,discussion11," Postprandial events related to TG metabolism are important factors related to the development and progression of atherosclerotic disease, and the rs964184 variant in the ZRP1 gene has been identified through genome wide association study (GWAS) studies as one of the most strongly associated with the magnitude of postprandial TG response. In our study, we describe a novel gene-diet interaction between the long-term consumption of two healthy dietary patterns (LF diet and MedDiet) and the ZPR1 rs964184 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on postprandial TG in coronary patients. Therefore, patients with the G-allele at this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) would benefit more from a low-fat diet to reduce their genetically induced postprandial hyperlipemia. Further studies should confirm whether such modulation would lead to a reduction in the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and investigate the underlying mechanisms that explain this interaction.",accc7c5a-9dad-44af-b25c-b8b705e94b0e
