0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design and Subjects  This randomized, two-arm, single-center, exploratory study was conducted at a tertiary University Hospital. It was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee, and written consent was obtained from all study participants. Women candidates for BS, aged 18–68 years, with a BMI of 40–50 kg/m2 and two additional features of metabolic syndrome (fasting glucose 100–126 mg/dL, arterial blood pressure >130/85 mmHg, high density lipoprotein (HDL) <50 mg/dL, triglycerides >150 mg/dL) and stable weight during the 3 previous months were consecutively invited to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria were tree nut allergy, type 2 diabetes, treatment with metformin or corticosteroids (except inhaled corticosteroids), regardless of indication, active pharmacological treatment related to weight gain or weight loss, previous BS, abnormal thyroid function and lack of commitment to follow the protocol.",42e04c53-df88-47b3-8761-d2432abf2ec4
1,methods1," A total of 38 women candidates to BS were 1:1 assigned by simple randomization to the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) or control group according to a computer-generated list of sequential random allocation. A call to the coordinator office ensured that the treatment was assigned correctly according to the randomization list. The investigators that performed the histological and analytical studies were blinded to the allocation of intervention groups by using successive patients’ codes. Given the absence of previous studies evaluating the role of Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) on white adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction, it was not possible to formally calculate the sample size; therefore, this study is considered exploratory. The recruitment period was from July 2018 to December 2019. Two participants in the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) group were receiving statin treatment.",c9e09624-f561-48a0-9d80-6e6bcaf9fbc5
2,methods2," From the control group, 3 were on statin and 1 on ezetimibe therapy.  2.2. Nutritional Intervention  After a 3-month weight stabilization phase during which maintenance of the participant’s usual dietary pattern was encouraged, participants were randomly assigned to the almond-supplemented MD group (Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA)) or maintenance of usual diet (control) group in which no changes in dietary habits were advised. All participants were followed by a nutritionist every 2 weeks during the 3-month stabilization phase and the 3-month intervention phase. Total caloric intake was estimated and adjusted to ensure body weight was stable throughout the stabilization and intervention phases of the study. Physical activity was not promoted. Following randomization, participants in the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) group received raw unpeeled almonds at no cost for the entire study (equivalent to 30 g/d).",a39f5d3e-ea4d-4214-9c9a-5c16f98b245a
3,methods3," The nutritional composition of almonds per 100 g was: 628 kcal; total fat—56 g; saturated fat—4.9 g; carbohydrate—2.2 g; sugars—2 g; dietary fiber—9.8 g; protein—24 g; salt—0 g; vitamin E—17 mg; calcium—223 mg; phosphorus—458 mg; magnesium—232 mg; iron—3 mg. Instructions were given about how to increase MD adherence in the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) group in order to increase the use of olive oil for cooking and dressing, consumption of fruit, vegetables, fish and white meat instead of red or processed meat and to promote the preparation of homemade sauce with tomato, aromatic herbs, onion, garlic, and olive oil to dress vegetables, pasta, rice, or other dishes. At study inclusion and every 2 weeks, dieticians delivered individual sessions consisting of informative talks and provided written material with elaborated descriptions of typical MD foods, seasonal shopping lists, meal plans and recipes.",0f85bb70-0c72-4585-a9db-88398baf2004
4,methods4," A previously validated 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)) was used to assess adherence to Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) at baseline and at months 1, 2 and 3 of the study [24]. α-Linolenic acid (and 3 of the study [24] α Linolenic acid (ALA)) relative content of red blood cell membranes was measured as a biomarker of nut consumption by gas chromatography using an Agilent 7890 A Gas Chromatograph (Agilent España, Spain), as previously described [25].  2.3. Examinations and Calculations  Anthropometric measures (body weight, waist circumference, and body mass index) and blood pressure were collected following standardized procedures at baseline and at the end of the dietary intervention period.  2.4. Mixed Meal Tolerance Test  Patients attended the research facility before and after the dietetical intervention.",520f3d8a-4852-4a7a-839b-28ccec1130cd
5,methods5," After an overnight fast, a cannula was inserted into the distal forearm; blood samples were withdrawn at baseline for glucose, insulin, lipidic profile and inflammatory circulating molecules measurement. Patients were then asked to ingest a 250 mL standard liquid mixed meal (SLMM; Isosource Energy, Novartis, Switzerland; contained 398 kcal, with 50% of calories being carbohydrates, 15% protein and 35% fat) over 5 min. Additional blood samples were obtained at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after meal ingestion for insulin and glucose measurements. The following indexes were calculated with these data: HOMA-IR, Matsuda Index, Insulinogenic Index and Disposition Index [26].  2.5. Body Composition  Total body fat and lean mass were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)) using a GE Lunar idual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) with the software enCORE provided by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI, USA).",93061862-5ed0-47e2-a4bb-5430f349c84b
6,methods6," The software was also used to calculate estimated visceral fat (evisceral adipose tissue (VAT)) in the android region from the following formula: total adipose fat mass in the android region = evisceral adipose tissue (VAT) + estimated subcutaneous fat in the android region [27].  2.6. Adipose Tissue Biopsies  At baseline, a subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) (Subcutaneous (SAT)) biopsy was performed following an 8 h fast. About 1 g of superficial adipose tissue was obtained, under local anesthesia with 1 mL mepivacaine 2%, through a 2 cm incision in the periumbilical zone under the edema area. At the end of the dietary intervention (<7 days after completion), participants underwent BS, and the same surgeon collected a second sample of Subcutaneous (SAT), from the same region and depth, and a sample of visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) (visceral adipose tissue (VAT)) from the distal portion of the omentum majus by surgical excision.",bda7cab7-2885-4039-b035-b199099781d2
7,methods7," Collection was performed before the specific bariatric procedure began. white adipose tissue (WAT) samples were collected in DMEM and rinsed in PBS. A portion was immediately frozen before RNA analysis. The other part was fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for standard paraffin embedding. Starting at the tissue apex, 3 sections of 3 μm thick were cut at a minimum of 100 μm intervals across the sample tissue. Serial sections were matched for additional independent analyses. All analyses on white adipose tissue (WAT) and blood samples were performed by an investigator blinded to patient allocation.  2.7. Fat Cell Area and Adipose Tissue Fibrosis  Hematoxylin and eosin staining was conducted to assess adipocyte morphology. A minimum of 5 pictures were taken from each sample at 10× magnification under a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. The area (μm2) of at least 2000 cells was digitally analyzed using ImageJ and the “MRI Adipocytes Tools” toolset (http://dev.mri.",1bae461f-709b-4dd8-b0df-2092d9b107d1

Gene Expression  Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Concentration and purity were measured using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Equal amounts of RNA from Subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (2 μg) were reverse-transcribed using the Superscript III RT kit and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).",3d6ccf83-417e-4a7d-b8b5-9b40352fa6d3

14,methods14," The effect of the nutritional intervention on anthropometric (weight, BMI, waist circumference, body fat%, estimated Subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT)) and metabolic variables (FPG, insulin, insulin sensitivity and secretion, and lipid profile) and circulating levels was assessed by Two-Way Repeated-Measures ANOVA. To assess differences between groups, Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney U test was used as appropriate for gene (Subcutaneous (SAT) fold changes and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mRNA levels) and protein expression. The Holm–Sidak method or Bonferroni post hoc were used to correct for multiple comparisons. All analyses were adjusted for baseline values except for visceral adipose tissue (VAT) tissue variables and Subcutaneous (SAT) immunofluorescence intensity values.",f8066cfb-4e2d-4da4-be86-d19e85ff7c18
15,methods15," As group allocation could be confounded by dietary adherence, analyses were performed both based on group allocation (Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) versus control group) as well as according to Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) adherence measured with Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) (highest versus lowest tercile) irrespective of group allocation. Spearman’s test and multiple linear regression adjusted for confounding factors (age, BMI) were performed to assess the association between Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and outcome variables. All statistical tests were performed using SPSS version 25.0 software (IBM Corp., New York, NY, USA) and GraphPad PRISM 6.0. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value below 0.05.  3.

16,methods16," Two participants from the control group dropped out of the study due to lack of commitment to keep appointments. Groups were well matched for additional variables (Table 1). No significant changes in body weight were observed in either group throughout the intervention. Both groups showed comparable low scores in Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) at baseline (<7 points, Supplementary Figure S1A). Patients allocated to the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) group showed a statistically significant increase in Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) throughout the study, which was accompanied by a raised and 3 of the study [24] α Linolenic acid (ALA) relative content in RBC membranes at the end of the intervention (Supplementary Figure S1B). No side effects of the nutrition intervention or due to biopsy collection were observed during the study.  3.1.",2f2ebfaa-5902-4fde-8d42-b78e90e7b156
17,methods17," Adipose Tissue Morphology  Mean Subcutaneous (SAT)- and visceral adipose tissue (VAT)-adipocyte area did not significantly change after the intervention in either group (Supplementary Figure S1C). Nevertheless, analysis of the adipocyte size distribution revealed that Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) favored the abundance of small adipocytes in Subcutaneous (SAT) (Figure 1A,B). Similarly, the adipocyte size distribution in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) showed the enrichment of smaller adipocytes in the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) group compared to controls (Figure 1C).  Sirius red staining on formalin-fixed sections showed that fibrosis around adipocytes (i.e., pericellular fibrosis) remained unchanged in both depots after the dietary intervention (Supplementary Figure S1D,E).  3.2.",2579d4cc-e07a-4856-bee7-7bb0b1f863cf
18,methods18," Changes in Gene Expression in Subcutaneous (SAT)  A gene-expression analysis of genes involved in inflammation, adipogenesis, autophagy, fatty acid (FA) metabolism, FA oxidation (FA oxidation (FAO)), adipocyte britening, glucose metabolism and adipokines was performed in Subcutaneous (SAT). Intervention-associated changes were comparable in the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) and control groups (Supplementary Figure S2A–F). Among these genes, only the leptin receptor (LEPR, Figure 2A) and autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5, Figure 2B) showed differential albeit not statistically significant expression patterns (p = 0.054 and p = 0.066, respectively). The relative mRNA expression of TGFB1 did not change throughout the study (Supplementary Figure S1F).",310cef15-b550-465c-9d9c-860797ed2b1e
19,methods19," On the contrary, the expression of the angiogenesis-related genes PDGFRB, VEGFA, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 was significantly increased after Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) intervention compared to controls (Figure 2C). A higher VEGFA protein expression at the end of the study was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 2D), while CD31 protein abundance was not significantly different among groups (p = 0.056, Figure 2E).  3.3. Differences in Gene Expression in visceral adipose tissue (VAT)  A larger expression of the pan-macrophage marker CD68 and the M2-type macrophage markers MSR1/CD204 and MRC1/CD206 was found in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from subjects in the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) group (Figure 3A). Of note, M1-type macrophage marker CD80 expression was not different. These differences were confirmed by the quantitative analysis of MRC1 immunofluorescence staining in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) sections (Figure 4A).",7cc43ebc-e1a8-46bd-95b9-2029cd8f3d65
20,methods20," Conversely, Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) group allocation was not associated with differences in the mRNA expression of cytokines (Figure 3A).  As in Subcutaneous (SAT), the gene expression of PDGFRB was increased in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from women in the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) group. Larger VEGFB expression, but not VEGFA expression, was also found (Figure 3B). Additionally, a higher presence of CD31 positive cells was detected by immunofluorescence in tissue sections (Figure 4B). The mRNA gene expression of the adipogenesis marker PPARG was larger in the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) group (Figure 3C) and such an increase was confirmed at the protein level by immunoblotting (Figure 3H) and immunofluorescence staining (Figure 4C) of the PPARG2 isoform. The expression of senescence-related genes p16, p21 and p53 was comparable across groups.",b80ac14b-03d1-41a5-a3cc-5252e835dcf0
21,methods21," However, we found an increased expression of autophagy-related ATG7 and ATG12 in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) group (Figure 3D), while ATG5 showed a non-significant trend (p = 0.054). Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) also had no effect on the visceral expression of various glucose metabolism-related genes and adipokines (Supplementary Figure S2G–H).  Finally, we also screened several genes implicated in the different steps of FA metabolism. Interestingly, Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) was associated with a larger expression of the lipolysis-regulating genes PLIN1, ATGL and MGLL (Figure 3E) and this was accompanied with a higher expression of β-adrenoceptor 1 (ADRB1) at mRNA (Figure 3G) and protein level, measured by Western blotting (Figure 3H) and immunofluorescence staining (Figure 5A).",06d5986b-b842-4929-af02-6ff4fe6ebb45
22,methods22," Similarly, genes related to FA oxidation (FAO) and thermogenesis (PPARA, PGC1A) and mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein subunit A (subunit A (SDHA)) appeared to be positively modulated (Figure 3F). The white adipocyte britening marker PRDM16 was upregulated (Figure 3G), while CIDEA showed a trend towards a larger expression (p = 0.07). Despite the browning marker gene UCP1 expression being comparable, an increased expression of the uncoupling proteins UCP2 and UCP3 after Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) was observed. Larger protein levels of UCP2 were confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Figure 3H) and immunofluorescence (Figure 5B), while UCP3 content was undetectable by Western blot and showed a non-significant trend after immunofluorescence staining of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) sections (Figure 5C).",31243a5d-0741-4959-aeb5-3f91f63f49f6
23,methods23," Furthermore, the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) group showed larger mRNA expression of ABCA1 and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genes, implicated in cholesterol efflux and high density lipoprotein (HDL) formation (Figure 3E).  3.4. Clinical and Circulating Parameters  At the end of the three-month intervention, anthropometrical parameters, body composition and insulin resistance indexes were unchanged. Still, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) group, as well as several inflammatory parameters such as GM-CSF, IFN-γ and IL-1ß. Soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAMs), adiponectin and other inflammatory markers remained unchanged in both groups (Table 1).  3.5.",a4a3f3c1-7ad9-4e29-b4a7-5351b9148dee
24,methods24," Associations with Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS))  As mentioned above, we also performed an exploratory analysis of data based on Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) adherence irrespective of group allocation. MD adherence was estimated from the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) (highest tertile, ≥11 points, versus lowest tertile, ≤6 points). This analysis was concordant with the metabolic and inflammatory findings mentioned above. In the subgroup with the highest Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) punctuation, intervention resulted in a significant reduction in IL6, IL1ß, INF-γ, GM-CSF, and TNFα levels, compared to subjects with the lowest Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) punctuation (all p < 0.05, data not shown). Additionally, and similarly to the allocation-group comparison, no differences were found in adiponectin, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and SAA according to MD adherence.",ef3b796e-5495-435b-a00b-e3350d7ce522
25,methods25,"  Finally, positive associations between Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) expression of ABCA1, PPARA, PGC1A, ADRB1 and ADRB3 were found (Table 2).  4. Discussion  In our study, a short-term Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) intervention was associated with changes in female white adipose tissue (WAT) biology, especially in the visceral depot. Most of these effects revolve around the amelioration of characteristic features of obesity-induced white adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction and were accompanied by increased anti-inflammatory macrophage infiltration in visceral adipose tissue (VAT). The changes in adipose tissue biology occurred concomitantly with clinical changes, namely, an improvement in lipidic profile and decreased inflammatory circulating molecules.",951cb0fe-dea1-4121-9040-03bd449715fb
26,methods26," Despite the short term, Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) did not modify insulin resistance indexes in our study, changes in other metabolic parameters and, perhaps even more significant, in white adipose tissue (WAT) morphology occurred within three months after the adoption of an Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA).  Presence of hypertrophic, insulin-resistant adipocytes is one of the main features of white adipose tissue (WAT) in the context of obesity. After an Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) intervention, both white adipose tissue (WAT) depots showed a shift towards a smaller adipocyte population, despite no changes in body composition estimated by dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) were found, reflecting fat redistribution into newly recruited preadipocytes. This phenomenon was accompanied by an upregulation of PPARG, PPARA and lipolysis-related genes in visceral adipose tissue (VAT).",b0427b6d-6eb1-451f-a12f-6199b69152c9
27,methods27," PPARG is a master regulator of adipocyte biology and modulates lipid metabolism through the release, transport and storage of free FAs [28]. PPARG2 is the splice variant with the highest adipogenic activity and is exclusively localized in white adipose tissue (WAT) [29]. Likewise, PPARA is important for inducing adipocyte mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulating genes involved in FA oxidation (FAO) and limiting proinflammatory signaling during chronic lipolytic activation [30]. Both PPARG and PPARA agonisms promote the white-to-brite conversion in human adipocytes [31].  We also described an upregulation of ADRB1 in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) after Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA). It is known that various subtypes of β-adrenergic receptors are present in white adipose tissue (WAT); their agonism leads to the proliferation of brown adipocytes (ADRB1) [32] and lipolysis and/or of thermogenesis activation (ADRB2 and ADRB3) [33].",39abd2bf-f662-4950-b1ba-8485dd5599f6
28,methods28," Interestingly, recent studies state that ADRB1, and not ADRB3, might be the primary regulator of brown adipocyte metabolism in humans [34]. white adipose tissue (WAT) beiging has been associated with large-scale tissue remodeling, including increased micro-capillary formation, nerve innervation and modulation of immune cell populations [35]. Despite the fact that the expression of UCP1, the specific marker of brown and beige adipocytes, remained unaltered in our study, other thermogenic markers such as PGC1A and PRDM16 increased after Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) in visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Of note, several UCP-1 independent thermogenic mechanisms have been identified in recent years [36]. PGC1A, the master regulator of mitochondrial division [37], controls thermogenic gene activation in response to cold and β-adrenergic agonists [38] and interacts with PPARA to coactivate target genes involved in mitochondrial FA oxidation (FAO) [39].",553216b3-ace0-4f99-a157-e3f1e7f12aff
29,methods29," On the other hand, PRDM16 specifically regulates the induction of brown-fat-specific genes during the differentiation process by binding and enhancing the transcriptional function of PPARG, PPARA and PGC1A [40,41].  Unlike UCP1, the uncoupling protein UCP2 was upregulated after Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) while the increase in UCP3 was only significant at the mRNA level. Recent findings involve UCP2 in the transport of four-carbon mitochondrial substrates (e.g., malate, oxaloacetate, and aspartate) outside the mitochondria [42], which allows the regulation of mitochondrial substrate oxidation and reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) levels regardless of mitochondrial uncoupling [43,44].",56a6dd11-1669-4041-baa2-ade9b6b215e2
30,methods30," On the other hand, several studies reported an important role of UCP3 in FA oxidation (FAO) and oxidative damage prevention by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) [45,46,47], stating that UCP3 may facilitate FA oxidation (FAO) by transporting FAs into the mitochondria [48], thus proposing a protective role for this protein in obesity [49]. Of note, both UCP2 and UCP3 activation efficiency increases with increased FA unsaturation and chain length [50], features that FAs predominantly found in MD fulfill.  In our study, increased lipolysis was accompanied by an upregulation of ABCA1 and apolipoprotein E (apolipoprotein E (APOE)) genes, which play a major role in high density lipoprotein (HDL) biogenesis and thereby are candidate mediators of MD-related atheroprotective effects.",b13513cb-bba5-4fac-a3a5-afa0eea37c37
31,methods31," ABCA1 is an integral cell-membrane protein that mediates the rate-limiting step of high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) biogenesis and suppression of inflammation by triggering signaling pathways through interaction with an apolipoprotein acceptor [51]. apolipoprotein E (APOE) has long been known to be atheroprotective, mainly because of its ability to promote the removal of atherogenic lipoproteins from the circulation and the formation of apolipoprotein E (APOE)-containing high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles [52]. Interestingly, lower LDL cholesterol circulating levels were found after Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA).  Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) was associated with the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) expression of autophagy genes ATG5 and ATG7. A protective role has been proposed for autophagy in the context of obesity [53,54,55].",6799b7a5-4fac-4235-8afc-bb9ce4a87cc2
32,methods32," It has been speculated that some of the beneficial effects of MD could be partly explained by the ability to activate the autophagy of some of its components [56]. Thereby, polyphenols present in some of the main ingredients of the MD were shown to enhance autophagy, such as resveratrol, present in grapes, wine and some nuts [57,58], and oleuropein or oleocanthal, present in extra-virgin olive oil [59]. Almonds, in particular, among Mediterranean tree nuts, are especially rich in α-tocopherol [8,16], another well-known antioxidant. Previous clinical studies have verified the modulatory effects of almonds on serum glucose, lipid levels, the regulatory role on body weight, and protective effects against diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [15,16,60].  Despite the short duration of the intervention, these changes in white adipose tissue (WAT) were accompanied by a significant decrease in systemic inflammation biomarkers and improvements in lipid profile.",e9b6c1d2-eaaf-4c87-bd35-d93508da9517
33,methods33," In one of the first MD studies, Estruch et al. showed a decrease in circulating IL6, C-reactive protein and total cholesterol after a 3-month intervention, while high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels raised [12]. In accordance with previous reports by other authors, we found reduced levels of total cholesterol [12,61,62], LDL cholesterol [61,62], IFN-γ, GM-CSF and IL-1ß [63] after Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA). Although previously described as downmodulated by MD [12], circulating sICAM-1 remained unaltered in our study, albeit its levels were negatively correlated with Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). Nevertheless, we could not demonstrate any effect of a 3-month Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) intervention on markers of insulin resistance or body composition. This could be related to the short intervention duration and the relative mild insulin resistance at baseline.",5237871d-1b2c-4520-83bc-f8a8893dac9c
34,methods34," Additionally, the small number of subjects could explain the absence of changes in these two clinical parameters.  We acknowledge this study is not without limitations. As mentioned above, the limited number of subjects included in our exploratory study could have hampered our ability to find significant changes in several of the parameters included in the analysis. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that comprehensively addresses the study of adipose tissue function following an MD intervention. Second, it could be argued that our dietary intervention was too short to result in significant modifications of clinical parameters. This means that such a short-term study does not necessarily imply that the findings persist for years. However, the results of the present study are strongly indicative of a beneficial effect of the Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA) also on a long-term basis.",2247f5dd-5d06-4cb2-b374-adbf63d4bc40
35,methods35," Third, our study population was limited to women with severe obesity. We chose to include women only to avoid the confounding effect of gender in the context of a study with a small sample size and this limits the scope for drawing conclusions on a male population. Of note, differences between groups were more evident in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and this adipose tissue compartment is only available in subjects scheduled for abdominal surgeries, as BS. Obviously, access to visceral adipose tissue (VAT) only at the end of the intervention could be viewed as an additional limitation. However, we deem it unlikely that major differences prior to intervention explain our findings as study groups were well matched for body composition and laboratory data.  5.",fd415b3a-f84a-4999-8cda-55d310c3caef
36,methods36," Conclusions  In summary, a short-term MD intervention supplemented with almonds was associated with an increased expression of adipogenesis, angiogenesis and autophagy-related genes in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) compared to controls. This was accompanied by an upregulation of FA utilization and several markers of thermogenesis. Some of these changes point to a diminished reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhanced tissue health in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) depot. The appearance of a small adipocyte population and the higher presence of M2-like anti-inflammatory macrophages may be explained in part by an Mediterranean diet supplemented with almonds (MDSA)-dependent modulation of adipocyte metabolism. These changes in white adipose tissue (WAT) biology were accompanied by systemic benefits, such as decreased inflammatory circulating levels and decreased total and LDL-cholesterol levels.",e7615b82-3625-4423-bcf2-a86488c3c113
37,methods37,"  Overall, our results support a protective effect of the MD supplemented with almonds in obesity-related metabolic complications and provide potential mechanistic links between MD-induced improvements on white adipose tissue (WAT) biology and the proven systemic benefits of this dietary pattern.
